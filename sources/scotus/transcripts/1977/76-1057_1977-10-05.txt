P R O CEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in 76-1057, Key against Doyle.
Mr. Willis, I think you may proceed when you'ra
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FLOYD WILLIS III, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. WILLISs

Mr® Chief Justice, may it, pleas® the

Courts
Very briefly I'd like to mention the statement of
the case to this Court.
This case involves a D.C. Mortmain statute, Section
18“302, and that statute basically provides that:

"A devise

or bequest or real or personal property to a minister, priest,
rabbi, public teacher, or preacher of the gospel-, as such,*8
religious orders, and so on.
It is not valid unless it's made within 30 days
before the death of the testator.
Sally® Lipscomb French executed a will and left
religious bequests and did not survive 'that will for 30 days.
Thereafter, a complaint for instructions was filed
by Judge Doyle, and the case was heard before the Superior
Court on motion for summary judgment.

The religious legatees

being defendants’as well as the heirs-at-law.
The lower court found ‘that 18-302 is, in fact,

4
unconshitution&l for both First; and Fifth Aw@ndro.Qnt reasons.
Appeal was taken ‘to th© District Court of Appeals.

That

Court found that the statute was unconstitutional for due
process , or Fi f th Amom dment, re as ©ns,
QUESTION:
MR. WILLIS;
Amendment,

And didn’t deal with th® First Amendment?
It did not deal with th® First

Judge Reilly filed a concurring opinion, in which

he dealt with th© First Amendment,
QUESTION:

Ara you going to, at some time in

your argument, summarise the reasoning of the majority of the
Court of Appeals as to why it violated th© Fifth Amendment?
MR« WILLIS;
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.
And somewhere in your argument, will

you discuss the jurisdictional question, which you did not
cover in your brief, despit© our rule -that you ask that it be
covered?
MR* WILLIS5

Yes, Your Honor, that was the next

thing I was going to get •to, now that I've —
QUESTION;

Was there a reason you didn't cover it

in your brief?
MRo WILLIS;

Inadvertence, Your Honor«

It’s sort

of hidden, way down at th© bottom of on© ©£ your rules, and
I — w© just did not do so.

We did moke a statement that

1257(1) is th® basis of th© jurisdiction, but we did not
argue it, and we apologize to th© Court for not having don® so,

5
QUESTION:

Well f you knssw it was thsre whan, we

postponed rather than noted jurisdiction»
MR® WILLISs
©scaped us, too»

Frankly, the signi£icance of that

And w® are now prepared to argue, and our

argument would b© vary brief, basically based on Palmore,
that, this Court does in fact have appellate jurisdiction
because ©£ 1257(1} and because of the language in 1257(1)
which states that the purposes of this section

and I think

the language must include 'the whole section, paragraphs 1,
2, and 3 -- that the highest court of the State includes the
District of Columbia Court of Appeals,
And in Palmor®, I believe Your Honors decided
basically that since Congress had not said that a — that the
appellate rights of Mr, Palmore were because the statute was
in fact tli® — mad® the District of Columbia in fact equivalent
to a State statute, than it must follow, in all reasoning,
that ‘fee statute is in fact a statute of the United Statas,
And were it not so, I think that fee

additional

language that I’ve earlier cited would have no meaning,
la addition to that. Your Honors, I feel that there
are substantial federal questions involved here, and feat
our Jurisdictional Statement could be treated as a petition
for writ of certiorari»
Now, wife respect to the issues involved in this
case, it is submitted that; this statute does not infringe on

6

th©

establishment clause or the fre® exercise clause of th©

First Amendment»
At first blush, it certainly appears to involve
religion»

Th© statute is directed solely at religion»
QUESTION: Well, doesn't it include school teachers

of some kind?
MR» WILLIS?

Well, I don't think that's been th®

lower court's opinions ©f it, Your Honor.

It says "lay

•teachersS!.
QUESTION:

Well, you were addressing th© statute

as & whole, and my question g«as to that.

It says, "minister,

priet, rabbi, public teacher, or preacher of the gospel53.
MR. WILLIS:

I think within the meaning of that

statute, and th® legislative history that appears in th®
Congressional Record, that the statute is directed only at
religious parsons or institutions»
QUESTION:
MR. WILLIS:

You mean public teachers ©f religion?
I assume that's “die case.

I assume

that is someone who is not ordained, but goes about preaching
a religious precept.
QUESTION:

Then the next category "preachers of

th© gospel" would b© r@dun.dant, because there &r© a lot of
the preachers ©f th© gospel who ar® not ordained ministers,
I suppose.
MR* WILLIS:

That's conceivable, Your Honor»

I'm

7
not total ly farci liar with th© rul^as and regulations involving
ordainment,
QUESTION:

I suppose if there ware not a comma

after "publie teacher”, the meaning that you attribute to th®
statute would be much clearer:

public teacher or preacher of

the gospel»
That comma makes your construction of it a little
more difficult, doesn't it?

Or tit a construction that you

tell us that the District, ©£ Columbia courts have put on it»
MR® WILLIS s

I think those are just consecutive

statements of who the statute will apply to, Your Honor, and
I think teat’s what the comma means.
Now, it certainly is something that hasn’t occurred
to any of us before this, in th© arguments below, and I'm
taken somewhat by surprise by teat, and I rsally probably
don’t have a very good answer to it,
QUESTION s

The court in this case said teat the

section, by its terms, declares void only the bequests and
devises for tee benefit of religious institutions or th©
clergy.
MR* WILLISs

That's correct. Your Honor,

That’s

been th© position of both Judge Newman and th© D. c. Court
©f Appeals,
Now, the Court of Appeals decided this case only
on tea rational basis doctrine. It decided that the statute

8
had no objective that could stand a statutory scheme that
would make it consistent with the Constitution.
We submit that the statute is really part of the
statutory scheme involving the testamentary transfer of
property, a power reserved solely to 'the courts and solely
to the States, and that if the statute involves religion at
all, it just doss so indirectly.
The statute's objective is to prevent the improvident
gifts to

by a testator within this very brief period, 30

days, since the making of a will.
1 think it is a twofold and a prophylactic basis.
It is to preclude "the us® of undue influence by
religion, for the limited period ©£ 30 days,
QUESTIONj

But anybody else can us© it?

MR. WILLIS r,
QUESTIONz

Undue influence?
Yes.

MR, WILLIS s

Well, Your Honor, there &r@ abilities

to prevail whan undue influence has been used, independent ©£
this statute.
Certainly on© can resort to the courts and prove that
undue influence would have caused a testamentary disposition
by a caveat proceeding.
QUESTION!

I suppos® th© Legislature might have

thought that the threat of sternal damnation was a higher
degree of undue influence than the kind of influence that

9

might: be brought: by non-clerical people,
MR. WILLISt

That’s exactly what we submit. Your

Honor,
QUESTIONS

Like taking your foot off of the gas —

the oxygen tube.
MR. WILLIS i

I- don’t understand, Your Honor.

The other premis® of the statute is to preclude the
unwise distributi,on of one’s estate at this expense of one’s
natural heirs,, again limited solely to the 30“day period,
I submit that surely the effect ©a religion, if
there is any effect at all, is less than existed in Braunfeld,
wherein the Jewish merchants maintained they were discriminated
against because of their religious beliefs, in that they were
not able to stay in the status of Americans on Sunday.
The statute is not designed to punish religion, in
our view, or to limit religious practices or beliefs, nor is
its purpose to establish or d®-»establish religion.

It

proscribes, only for a vary brief period, testamentary
transfers and such proscription is for a legitimate State
purposei that is, the legitimate fear of government that
there is a mischief that can b® perpetrated by, as Mr. Justice
Rehnquist says, — or at least more readily by — a person
having hopes of, having the ability to express to a testator
the possibility of salvation.
We submit that the statute —

10

QUESTION:

Mr» Willis, what: happens in this case,

if this will ware to be -- well, suppose it gave the entire
estate to these religious beneficiaries, and it were held to
he in violation of this statuta, what would happen?
the earlier will be revived?

Would

Or would the decedent be

regarded as dying intestate?
MRe WILLISs

In this case, the decedent would

clearly be regarded as dying intestate, Your Honor, The
statute — there is a doctrine ©f independent relative — or
dependent relative revocation, which suggeste that if the
prior will raad® & similar dispositive schema, then the
prior will could b© used rather than intestacy.
And it. is stipulated that the doctrine does not
apply in this case»

There were two prior wills, 1960 and

1963,
QUESTION s

Which, certainly indicates how thin the

statute’s application to this decedent is?
MR® WILLISs

Well, Your Honor, the statuta is not

so thin, because she did not, in fact, make th© same sort of
religious bequest in her prior wills, only in th© will in
which she failed to survive for a period of 30 days

did she

make a substantial residuary bequest to religious institutions»
Actually, sh© mads those bequests to three
religious institutions:

Johns Hopkins University, although

it is not a church as such, is run by th® church and maintained

II
by the church.

And there has been some — as the Court of

Appeals in the District of Columbia said — legal legerdemain
that has enabled the statute to b© gotten around on occasion,
by declaring that a bequest ‘to a charitable institution which
is owned and run by a religion is not the earns as a bequest.

to a religion, per s®.
And much emphasis is put. on that by the Court of
Appeals of the District of Columbia.
QUESTION;

Wall, the effect ©f the statute is to

,„void only so much of the will as devises -a® bequest to th©
church or clergy, is it not?

It doesn't void th© whole will,

if there were independent bequests in it.
MR. WILLIS;

No, only the bequests are declared

to b© invalid, those bequests to religious persons,
institutions, et cetera,
QUESTION;

So if you gave to four universities,

two church-oriented and two not, the two church-oriented
wouldn't get it?
MR. WILLIS;

No, Your Honor, I don’t think so-r

W© conceded that Johns Hopkins does not fall within th® purview
of this statute, that Johns Hopkins is not in fact an
institution, a church institution, as such; but rather is an
educational institution that is incidentally operated by th©
church®

And we've don© so because the D. C. law has been

very clear that they would hold in that fashion.

12

There was also a specific bequest: to the Little
Sisters of the Poor in this case, again a non-sectarian
institution which is run by a Catholic Order,
QUESTION 3

So if you gave it to two clergymen

teaching at a university and two laymen teaching at a
university, the clergyman couldn't accept?
MR, WILLISs

Well, there's some law in the District

of Columbia that suggests that if you ar© in fact giving it
■to an individual because he's an individual rather than a
priest, ‘that the statute would not have its effect,
QUESTION:

Then it sounds like, by the time the

D, C, Courts get -through with it# there won't bs anything
•there.
MR, WILLISs

Well# they have mads serious inroads#

and that's on® of tee reasons we feel that it has# if any
effect at all# only a very minimal effect on the exercis© of
religion,

The 30-day period for on®, .and the fact that the

statute has been gotten around on many other occasions.
Now — I've kind of lost my place *— we also submit
that the statute does not violate th© Fifth Amendment,
QUESTIONS

Well# I just wonder if — let's assume

that, we disagreed with# or that we — well# why do we hav©
to reach the religious issue?
MR, WILLISt
religious issue

W© submit you don't have to roach th®

13

QUESTION?

What; if wa disagreed with the. lower court

on th® — that it violates th© due process clausa?
MR» WILLISs

If you reach the issue that it violates

the due process clause —QUESTION:
didn't

Well, what if we decide —- what if we

th© lower court said that this violates th© due

process clause»
MR0 WILLIS s

And also th© First Amendment,, the

lower court, th® Superior Court of the District of Columbia, —
QUESTION:

Wall, I know, but. th© Court of Appeals

didn't.
MR. WILLIS ?

Th© Court of Appeals did not.

They

said it, was not necessary —
QUESTION? Well, let’s assume we agree with you that
th© Court was wrong on the due process clause.
MR. WILLIS s
QUESTION:
MR. WILLIS:

Yes.
Then what do we do?
You reverse and remand th© case back,

I believe.
QUESTION:

Without talking about, the First

Amendment, do we?
MR. WILLIS:

I would hope that id'st would he •th&

case, although I'm certainly prepared here to argue.
QUESTION; Wellf you*v® already argued th© First

Amendment

14
MRo WILLIS s

I understand teat, and I argued that;

because I felt that, it was likely that Your Honors would want
to hear th© First Amendment argument»

They have -- the lower

court certainly made that argument, and the concurring opinion
of Judge Reilly certainly mad© that argument.
QUESTIONS

But ws have no idea what th® lower court

— how the lower court views the First Amendment issue,
MR» WILLIS:

That’s true, Your Honor.

It does — it does bean in this fashion, though,
Your Honor, on th© procedural or a substantive due process or
equal protection, the question becomes thems

Is there a

fundamental issue involved that requires strict scrutiny,
as opposed to the rational basis.
And getting to rational basis, if, in fact, th©
statute does create a classification, these classifications
don’t offend constitutional safeguards of th© Fifth Amendment.
Because the classifications are clearly related to the
statute’s objective; that 'is, as I’ve already said, to protect
th® testator during this very brief period whan they might
be inclined to leave their property in an unwise fashion,
and also, I believe, to preclude th© church from exercising
its unique abilities to influence gifts to religion.
QUESTION:

How does that apply if one of the members

of a professional football team, 27, 28 years old, makes a
will leaving ■ everything to a church, and then the airplane

15
carrying him down to Houston# Texas# for a football gam©#
crashes ten days later? does that have any *— is that statute
rational as applied to that situation?
Or is the purpose of the statute rational?
MR. WILLIS;

The purpose of the statute# I think,

is rational# Your Honor# and that’s the test.
QUESTION:

Under —*

Th® reason I picked a 27-year^old

professional football player is that I suspect he was not
anticipating death at the time ha made that will*
MR* WILLIS:

That's correct.

Judge Newman# for

instance, pi deed out a 25~y@ar-©Xd Ferrari driver# and the
QUESTION; Well# that might be more dangerous*
MR. WILLIS 5

Yes.

[Laughter.j
MR. WILLIS;

Should be.

At any rate —•
QUESTION; Well# does it make any sense?

Is there

any element of undue influence as applied to an accidental
death occurring -MR. WILLISs

I don't 'chink so# Your Honor.

I think

teat that clearly is on® ©f those unfortunate situations that
runs in# runs afoul cf this statuta. But I don't think that
makes it unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

Just —

Or# at any event# we wouldn't have to

decide that in this case# because ws don't have a 27-yaar-old

16

professional football player.
MR, WILLIS:

No, I don't: think I agree with Your

Honor there# I think that that is an issue that has to b©
decided by this Court# and was addressed by the lower court#
that tiie statute may very wall apply to people in ‘the prim©
©f their life# who do not. contemplate death, and it may very
well allow people who die 31 days after of a terminal illness
to escape the effect of the statuta,
QUESTION:

The federal ©state and gift tax laws

used t© ~~ I think they d© not any more — contain© an
irrebutabis presumption that any gift made within one year
of death was in contemplation of death# and that presumably
would bo applicable to the Ferrari driver or the football
player, wouldn't it?
MP.o WILLIS:
QUESTION:

Yes# Your Honor,
And nobody, as far as I know, has

attacked the constitutionality of those provisions,
MR, WILLIS:

Well, no, the irreb«table presumption

was specifically decided to be invalid by this Court —

QUESTION;
MR, WILLIS:
QUESTION:
MR0 WILLIS?

In Micron?
The ifeiner —
Keiner, yes,
~~ Heiner case.

Later, the IRS went to a refutable presumption,
QUESTION * Right,

17
MR» WILLIS;

And that" certainly is something that

could also be argued here, that why not — and I think Judge
Newman said this — why not have a rebutable presumption, so
that there could b© soma kind of procedural due procsss review
so that Chief Justice Burger’s example would be free from the
effect of the statute.
Well, I submit, to you there's a couple of reasons.
One, the testator is always dead, so that the
motives of the testator are never going to be able to be
discovered.
And two, it's awfully hard to Imagine, at a due
process h@ari.ng, the person who exercised that undue influence
coming in and conceding it.
And I think it would bcs a futile act to hav© & due
process hearing under that situation.
an irrebutable presumption.

If, in fact, 'this is

And I think in order for it to b©

an irrebutable presumption, -that is the only tame we’re going
to hav© to have a due process hearing, to determine that.
QUESTION;

Where would the influence be if somebody

left money to the Episcopal Bishop in Konya?
MR» WILLIS;

I think if thatperson was in fact a

resident ©f the District of Columbia, that statute

that

bequest would be declared invalid.
QUESTION;
MR. WILLIS;

Evan if nobody knows who he is.
I gusss there would have to be scone

18
Sealing that he» was in fact; a religious person. Your Honor,
‘that would *— ha would he, I believe, allowed to come in on a
du© process basis and show that the statutes didn’t apply to
him, just as somebody would be allowed to show that, no, the
date on this will is in fact 31 days before ~~
QUESTION;

You mean a bishop, you’d shew that he's

not a clergyman?
MRo WILLISs

A bishop not a clergyman?

I always

thought that all bishops were clergymen®.
QUESTION,” Wall, that's what I thought®

But you said

he could com© in and —
MR® WILLISs

Well, if h@ could show — if h© could

make a showing that he wasn't a clergyman, that his title of
bishop didn't in fact mean that, I think he would be entitled
to
QUESTION;

It would take a whole lot ©£ money to

get that, I think®
MR® WILLIS;

As I have indicated, I believe this

to be a rational classification, largely because of the unique
ability ©£ religions to purvey this kind of influences®
While it's true —» and this is something •feat the
lower courts addressed themselves to — that there are other
classes ©f people who may have an equal opportunity, that is
access"Wis@, to influence ‘the testator, our submission is, as
Justice Rehnquist, has suggested, that none of them possess the

19
ability to suggest salvation* in return, for a substantial
bequest®
1 also suggest that there's a way that the harsh
■aspect of this statute could have been avoided* particularly
in the case of Sally© Lipscomb French®

Her wills -were written,
1

by a lawyer* she was 87 years old* it appears likely that her
lifespan was a short, one* she certainly could have mad® an
infer vivos trust.* which would exist for 31 days or 35 days*
which would dispose of the identical property that she
disposed ©£ by her will.

And it could have been defined®

So that there was a way that the

.harshness of the

statute could have been avoided, if in fact she was a rational
person, not affected by undue influence, then,'she could have
elected to do so®
And she is not a welfare recipient who is not going
to b© put in the position ©£ having to g© to a lawyer and
writ® a will, as has been th© problem in some of the illegiti­
macy casea that Your Honors have decided®
I submit that in the irrebutable presumption area
the case decided by Your Honors of Weinberger vs® Salfi is
controlling®
In that case, as you may recall, there was an
irrebutsbl© presumption as .such, that one who marries a person
entitled to welfare benefits — not welfare, social security
benefits, and that marriage fails to survive for a nine-month

20
period, that th© widow is in fact not* entitled to the survivor
benefits *
And Your Honors have decided that that statuta is
in fact a prophylactic one, as this one is a preventive one,
that does not require anything other than the showing that
in fact they d© not meet the standards tost are required
under that statute»
And that’s the same, I believe, set of facts her©,
except we are only dealing with 30 days, we're not dealing
with nine months.

Mr» Salfi, in fact, died of a heart attack,

and the suggestion is that it could have bean shown, if
allowed, by Mrs* Salfi that h® was & healthy man and this
marriage was entered into not for a sham but rather-as a
genuine marriage,
I submit also,now that we've already talked about
it a little bit, that there is no reason to apply the strict
scrutiny standard,

I submit the statute has a clearly

secular purpose? that is, to protect the testator and th©
heirs, and to prevent a particular class, a defined class,
from exercising undue influence within a very limited period,
Now, its primary «ff©ct I think neither advances nor
inhibits religion.

And I emphasize the words '’primary effect.5* „

And there is no excessive entanglement with religion in this
i

case, a© marcs so, certainly, than in the tax case, Walz.
And in that situation/ as I*ve indicated, the primary

21

effect; portion of that; standard is on© that must; most closely
be reviewed.
The question becomes, in my view, in our view —
is the incidental impact on religion, that is, the denial of
this bequest, here, assuming that, there is an incidental
impact, which results from a non-fundamental interest: of
a scheme of testamentary disposition, obviously one which
does n©fe have a fundamental right attached to it.,

There’s

some question as to whether or not there's a right to
testamentary disposition without the State procedures in any
event, Is that incidental impact sufficient, to trigger
strict scrutiny?
And I submit that in the standard that Your Honors
have previously made, the primary effect clearly eliminates
incidental impact.
And, consequently, that there is no compelling State
interest that must be shown by the hairs-at-law, or,
ordinarily, by the District of Columbia Government? but they
have declined to become involved in this, after the Superior
Court case.
Further, I suggest that what the. courts below have
don© is they have substituted their own judgment for what is
purely a legislative function.
the statute»

There is a rational basis for

They don't like th® statute and, as a consequence,

they declare the statute to be violative of the Fifth and the

22

Fourteenth Amendments.
The statute may no longer be as valid as it one© was
— it*s an 1066 statute, the same Congress 'that passed the
Fourteenth Amendment.

And Judge Pomeroy, in a dissent in a

case from Pennsylvania, In,re Estats of CavllI, said that;
”In an age whan the hop® of salvation may be lass vivid and
the fear of damnation less acute than formerly it was, one
may disagree with the wisdom or necessity of the provision
before us today; but wisdom

whether feat of this Court or

fee legislature — is not determinative of legislative power.”
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Willis.

Mr. Bauersfeld.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARL F. BAUERSFELD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. BAUERSFELD;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Courts
I would like first to address myself to fee juris-dictional question.
Tha appellees renew their motion to dismiss this
appeal on the ground that fee Court has no jurisdiction over
tha appeal under Title 28 U.S.C. Section 1257.
This motion is based upon fee fact feat while any
statute of Congress is a statute of fee United-States,
Congress did not intend laws applicable only in fee District

23
of Columbia to ba statutes of te© United States, for purposes
of tills Court’s appeal jurisdiction under Section 1257 of
Title 28«,
We rely on the case ©f the American Security and
Trust Company vs, the CtommigsionQra, and the other cases cited
in our motion to dismiss, and also in th© brief»
In the American Security case, the Court had under
consideration th© provisions of Section 250 of the Judicial
Cod®, enacted in 1911, which provided that any final judgment
or decree of the Court of Appeals may be re-examined in cases
in which th® construction of any law of th© United States
i

is drawn into question by the defendant.
The Court in th© American Security case held teat
Section 250 of the Judicial Code should not be applied to
purely local laws applicable only in tee District of Columbia.
Th© opinion pointed out teat the same phrase used
in th© statute may have different meaning in different
connections*

In other words, it is tee context in which

Congress uses the phrase teat is important? and it is, we say
hare, that th© context in tee present situation, it is
unreasonable to believe teat Congress, in cases from the
District of Columbia Court of Appeals, where a statute is
limited or confined to th® operation in th© District of
Columbia, are determined to be invalid, is not to com® to
this Court by direct appeal.

24

In Palmcre vs,, salted States, the Court pointed out
that, jurisdictional statutes are to b© strictly construed in
authorizing appeal to this Court,

That case interpreted

certain provisions of the District of Columbia Court Reform
and Criminal Procedure Act of 1970,

That Act clearly

indicated that distinctions between statutes of the United
States and statutes of the District of Columbia are of
jurisdictional importance, if the new District of Columbia
Courts , organised under Article I,, war© to b© able to function
as purely local courts and the United States District Court
for til© District of Columbia, was to b@ able to function as
an exclusively Article III court.
By Section 172(c) of that Act, Congress added
Section 1363 to Title 28 of the Cod®, and that section providas %
For purposes ©f this chapter

referring to District Court

jurisdiction — references to the laws of the United States
or Acts of Congress do not include laws applicable exclusively
to the District of Columbia.
Congress has recognized, not only in the District
of Columbia Court Reform Act of 1970, but generally, that
enactments, for the District of Columbia . are separate and
distinct from those that are applicable to the entire United

States.
It has don® this by enacting two separate Codes.
The District ©£ Columbis. Code specifically provides that it

25

contains all the general and, permanent laws relating to or
enforced in the District of Columbia, except such laws as are
applicable in the District of Columbia by reason of being
laws of th® United States,

The latter laws, of course, appear

in tiie United States Cod®,

MR, BAUERSFELDs

Well, at th® present time, the

of Columbia Circuit by certiorari,
QUESTION;

If it holds a State Act unconstitutional,

doesn't the State hav© a right of appeal, rather than certiorari?

26

MR. BAUERSPELD:

I think undar 1254, that it may

only come hers by certiorari.
Certainly if a State court holds th© State statute
unconstitutional, it has no right to come her©.

That's right.

MR, BAUERSFELD:

I've bean corrected, Your Honor,

My only point is I think you place this

That is what my argument is, Your

United States Court of Appeals for th© District of Columbia.
QUESTION: Well, what's involved in tills case, and
you argue to us that you want to cut down on th® number of
appeals to this Court, do you realise that you're using undue
influence?

27
[Laughter* ]
MR* BAUERSFELD:

I didn’t understand that, sir.

QUESTIONs Well, if I understand it;, what you’re
suggesting is that even when the District of Columbia Court of
Appeals, as in this case, declares a District statute
unconstitutional, a statute whose operation is confined to
the District, unconstitutional under the Federal Constitution,
that the only review h©r© in this Court from the District of
Columbia Court of Appeals is by certiorari. Is that right?
MR, BAUERSFELD:

Yes, sir*

That we

should treat this as a p@ti.tion for cert, and then deny it?

MR* BAUERSFELD:

But to further answer your question,

if th® District of Columbia Code is considered & State statute,
th© laws ar© equivalent to a State, then it’s invalidating a

th® State court could not com® to this Court by appeal,

QUESTION:

Well, if you deal with it. as a State court, then if
it's sustained, under your approach, if it's sustained, a

QUESTION:

Let’s see if I follow you.

Didn't Palmore

It did say that, sir, but of course

I'm getting back to my context argument in that ©vent.

QUESTION:

used in Palmo re, that is correct.

No, I say, as

But. in the context hare,

Congress, I'm saying, never intended to confer upon this
Court appeal jurisdiction, jurisdiction on direct appeals,
because, whii® the District of Columbia Court of Appeals is
the highest court, it’s the same as the highest court of a
State, that does not necessarily mean that the statutes that
are enacted are also of the highest court.
QUESTION: Well, I understand that, but why can’t
you reach the same conclusion — and what’s wrong with the
argument — that these are a species of .legislation- which ar©
neither statutes of a State, unquote, or statutes of the
United States, within the meaning of that term?
MR. BAUERSFELD:
correct.

Well, of course, teat is absolutely

They are not, because they can’t be statutes of a

Stata because they ar© not enacted by a State, they are
enacted by the Congress.
QUESTION:

And they are not a statute of the

30

United States by analogy to tha section in a later chapter.
Of course, that doesn’t literally apply to this case, because
it’s a different chapter,
MR, BAUERFELD:

That is correct.

We say that Congress did not intend, in creating
the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, to allow
appellate jurisdiction to this Court under the — every time
it holds a statute that is in tee District of Columbia Cod©
uncons tifeufcion &1«
To do so would really expand its jurisdiction.
In enacting th® District of Columbia Court Reform Act of
1970, Congress intended to have th© newly created Article 1
court function as local or State court? it intended the
United States District Court to function as an Article III
court. And by adding Section 136 3 to the U, S, Coda, it
attempted to restrict th© District Court’s jurisdiction to
Acts having general application.
It would seem to follow that tills Court's appellate
jurisdiction should be limited to cases involving statutes
of th© United States having general application rather than
Acts of Congress that are confined to the District of Columbia,
It is in this context -shat we urge the Court to
deny jurisdiction.
In Palmo re vsu United States,

this Court treated

tli® Jurisdictional Statement as a petition for certiorari.

31
It is submitted that, the Court should not follow
that procedure in this case, because this case presents
neither a substantial federal question nor an issue that
needs further elucidation by way of precedent»
The D„C„ statute here involved, the so-called
Mortmain statute, is unique in the United States, in that it
voids only religious testamentary gifts»
The Pennsylvania statutes and the other so-called
Mortmain statutes ar© not nearly so discriminatory, in that
they also prohibit gifts to other charitable organisations*
Her©, tin® District of Columbia stands to gain tax
revenue by continued validity of the statute, because the
District of Columbia Cod© provides that th© bequest would
escheat to the District of Columbia if the testator had no
living heirs»
Yet the District of Columbia did not appeal from th©
decision of th® Superior Court»

Th© United States has never

entered an appearance in the case»

Although each was given

notice under Rule 47 of the Rules of the District of Columbia
Court of Appeals, which is now inTitl©
28 U«S0C» Section
"
' rr. t- -2403, where you have to notify the Attorney General in cases
where there is a. constitutional question or a statute being
drawn into question»
So apparently neither th© District of Columbia nor
the United States consider -that the issues in this case are

32

subs-tan.ta.al, alse they would be here today»
Further, there is a bill now pending before the
City Council of the District of Columbia to repeal this
particular statute.

It is Bill 2-171, introduced Jun© 1,

MR, BAUERSFELDs
QUESTIONS

Yes, sir.

*»*» Birmingham and other cases.

MR. BAUERSFELDs

Before getting into the merits ,

perhaps I should restate the facts, or bring out some
additional facts.
The bequest that was made by Mrs, French left a
number of bequests, and in addition it left her residuary
to three personst

ona-third Johns Hopkins University, which

is not involved here, that bequest..

Everybody admits it should

be paid.
And then on© bequest to the Calvary Baptish Church,
one-third of the residuary? and ona-third to St. Matthews
Cathedral.
Mrs. French was a member of the Calvary Baptish
Church.

Her husband, a physician, who predeceased her, was

a member of the Catholic faith.
It was stipulated in the ease, and the Court of
Appeals held, there is no evidence that, the appellees had
made any attempt to influence her Choice of legate©.
In addition, this bequest in tails case involves only

35
personal property, and it doss not: involve any ra&l property»
The heirs-»at-law here ara collaterals, are a brother
and nieces and nephews»
Getting back to my argument on the merits, the
Court of Appeals relied os. the legislative history, and stated
that the purpose of the statute was to preclude death-bed
gifts to clergymen and to religious organizations by persons
who might be unduly influenced by religious considerations»
It pointed out that the statute voids only bequests
and devises for the benefit of religious institutions or
the clergy»
Testamentary bequests to charitable organisations
are not included in the D, c* statuta»
Further, the statute, as interpreted by the District
of Columbia Court

• and I believe this Court will follow

the interpretations of the District of Columbia Court ~~
distinguishes between bequests to religious institutions and
bequests to charitable institutions owned and operated by
r@ligious ins titutions»
The statute only invalidates bequests to religious
organizations for religious purposes and to the clergy»
The Court concluded that there was n© rational
basis for presuming that a testator, troubled by religious
convictions, is likely 'to make a bequest directly to a church
rather than to a charity run by a church»

36

The statute treats

thus -fcrsafcs similarly situated

legatees entirely different.
It further pointed out that there were others,
sudh as lawyers, doctors, nurses, and charities who are in
an equal position with some — to influence a testator.
Yet the statute never covers thorn.
And the singling out of reglion, where there is no
grounds or difference, is irrational.
As I stated before, this statute operates if -the
testator has no family or heirs, and that is, if there are
no heirs ©r family, the bequest is automatically void and
escheats to the District of Columbia.
It was stated that the courts of the District of
Columbia had used the doctrine of..dependent relative
revocation in other cases to avoid the statute, and this
is true.

And it was pointed out that it wasn't used in this

Regarding the tax law, irrebutal presumption and

gift remained.
QUESTION:

Right.

It was just presumed to be

MR. BAUERSFELD:

For tax purposes.

QUESTION: What was the name ©f the case in this
Court involving that, back in the Thirties, do you remember?
MR. BAUERSFELD:
QUESTION:

I'm sorry, I forget, sir.

I can't remember, either.

MR. BAUERSFELD:

It was suggested also by counsel

that the testator could have avoided this problem by making
inter vivos gifts.
Well, that argument, 1 think, conflicts wife the
decision of this Court, in Trimble

the rational® decision

in Trimble vs. Gordon, where feint is not the issue.

If she

had done that, then we wouldn't have the issue aera.
In his argument and in his brief, it is stated
by the appellants that it is questionable whether the statute
makes a. classification at all, and thus, whether the equal
concept of laws apply.
It is argued that it is a part of the law of the
District relating to testamentary disposition.

The appellees

recognise that a State can legislate to regulate both

38
testei:© and intestatas succession.
However, when the State does so legislate/ it cannot
do so in a discriminatory manner.

And it

is here, its laws

must be consistent with the requirements of equal protection.
And the statute here singles out gifts to religious institu­
tions, for religious purposes, and to the clergy, in a
discriminatory manner.
The appellante state that the statute does not
regulate a fundamental interest protected, by the First
Amendment, and therefore that there is no need to show a
compelling interest to justify tee statute.
It seams to me that it needs little or no argument

to show teat the free exercise of one's religion is a
fundamental constitutional right, protected by the First
Amendment.
Now, the Court ©£ Appeals did not "reach the issue
of whether the classification affects fundamental rights,
sines it concluded that the discriminatory treatment set
forth in tee statute could not withstand the rational basis
test.
However, the trial court concluded that there was no
compelling State interest to justify tea classification mad®
by tea statute.
The statute singles out; religious organizations, for
religious purposes alone, and precludes the right of the
