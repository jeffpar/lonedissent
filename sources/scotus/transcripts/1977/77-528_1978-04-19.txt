I sea®

QUESTION: Well, Mr® Claiborne, what is th© — what
business is it of the Executive Branch of th© United states to
take a position in a case like this, one© th© petition for

30
certiorari is granted to review an unfavorable decision to th©
government, of the Court of Appeals for tha District of Columbia
Circuit# and this Court is going to considor it ©a th@ merits#
what interest does th© government as an institutional litigator
have in waning a narrow construction of a statute on&cted by
Congress?
MR, CLAIBORNE:

Mr, Justice Rshnquish# of course the

United States is a statutory separate party and is therefor© a
respondent in this Court,

Xn this particular case# th© United

States has# or th© Department of Justice has a separate interest#
because it has an independent responsibility to enforce this
statute quite separate from the Commission's responsibility to
enforce -fell® sane statute in its regulatory field.
It is therefore appropriate# it seemed to us# that
th® United State© should apeak th® views ©f the Department of
Justice in this case# sine® it must be bound by th® decision
of this Court in this case,
QUESTION:

But if this Court upholds th© PCC# the

government will have &© problem prosecuting ems^s under th@
statute# because It will b@ given a fairly broad construction#
I would take it,
MR, CLAIBORNE s

Mr, Justice Relinquish# feh® government#

that is# th© Solicitor General and the Department of Justice
takes th© view that they should not press for broader
prosecutorial discretion than in their view tha constitutional

31
reach of the statute would authorize,,

And, accordingly , ifc

seems to us that, the Court ought h© haw the benefit of the
views ©£ the Department of Justice, as to the constitutional
reach ©f the statute»
QUESTION s

Would you think ish@ government, is ever

entitled as ®n institutional litigator through the Solicitor
General to assert that an Act of Congress is unconstitutional?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Justice Rehnqulst, there may be

rare occasions when that is so.

This is not such an occasion.

W® do net suggest that the statuto is unconstitutional, w®
suggest that- it has a limited application and that the
Commission has construed it, beyond that constitutional reach.
QUESTIONS

You say the United States is a statutory

party?
MR. CLAIBORNEs

Indeed, Mr. Justice Whit®.

I hav®

cited in the brief the previsions of both the Communications
Act and the Judicial Code which make that clear.

Perhaps the

clearest provision is that in the Judicial Code, and on© finds
it in Section 2342 which first tolls ms, in paragraph one there­
of, that, all final orders ©f the Federal Communications
Commission may be reviewable by Section 402(a) of Title 47, all
-*

covered by the following sections.

This is such an order,

issued by the Commission under Section 402 ©£ its statute.
And when w® then, turn to Section 2344, we note that
an action brought in the Court of Appeals to review such an

32
©rdsr is to la an action against; th© United States, and it
further providas at th@ and of teat provision that th® Clerk
shall serve & true copy ©f th© petition ©n the agency and ©n
the Attorney General.
Then when w© turn to Section 2348 of Title 28, w®
note that the Attorney General is responsible for and has
control of the interests of the government in all court
proceedings under this chapter»

Th© agency, sad any party in

interest, may appear — I am skipping words — as parties
thereto of their own motion and as of right»

Primary

responsibility of th© Attorney General, but independent right
©f th© agency to be represented»
Hence, here th© Commission, though not joined by
the Solicitor General, was authorised to file petition for
certiorari«
QUESTION;

Mr» Claiborne, does it occur to you that

there may be a difference between th© relationshipof th®
Department of Justices to, let us say, the Secretary ©f Defense,
a Cabinet officer, and th© relationship with what is called an
independent regulatory agency, which is not subject to th© same
way, surely, to th® direction of th® Executive Branch?
MR» CLAIBORNE;

Mr, Chief Justice, that would

certainly apply with greater force in those circumstances
where th© agency was not fra© to represent itself before this
Court, and where, therefore, the Soliciter General would feel a

33
greater inclination to support the independent Commission's
view, which could oth@rwls@ net b© presented to the Court»
When til® agency has an independent right to appear
her®, that con®ideration is perhaps lessened»

This* however,

is an unusual case in that the Department of Justice has a
quito separato responsibility under the statuto, and therefor©
cannot h© bound ©r overly influenced by the views of the
Commission as it applies to to® statute in & different field»
And, indeed, when this Court decided the ABC case
in 347 ©f to© Uni tad S totos Reports, the Court relied on to©
construction of that anti”lottery statute for -- in to©
Communications Act, relied ©n toe construction placed on that
statuto by to© Attorney General, and said it cannot have one
meaning for to© Commission and. another for to© Department of
Justice»

w© notice that toss Department of Justice did not

view these programs as violating that statuto»

And we were

influenced by tort in holding til at to© Commission has overstepped
that line»
QUESTION2

But there's a difference where the

Commission has authority by statute to come in, like to© ICC»

Indeed,

In this Court,

MR, CLAIBORNE:

Induced, Mr, Justice Marshall,

And

there have been instances in which th® Federal Maritime
Commission and th© United States have been at odds, and in th©
most recent such case th© Court upheld th® views of th® United
States rather than those o£ th© Federal Maritime Commission,

*

I didn’t mean by that t© say that that

was a nice way of doing business, or running a railroad,

joined the Commission in aoim of its submissions before this
Court,

appropriated by Congress?
MR, CLAIBORNE;

Mr, chief Justice, I do not know

whether federal funds are involved, but certainly it uses th®

35

Commission*

It is in ©vary respect like a commercial radio

station except only that it is owned and operated by a non­
profit corporations, and —
QUESTION;

And it doesn't take — have commercial

advertising?
MR0 CLAIBORNE;

It doesn't take commercial advertising»

and» of course» is not governed by the profit motive; and for
that reason may not be censored» as it were» by public* taste
to the same extent the commercial station —
QUESTION;

May not be?

MR* CLAIBORNE?
4

May not be influenced by the reaction

of a commercial public» who might view such material as is
involved in this case as distasteful» said accordingly sponsors
would net sponsor it, and the station would not air it*

That

consideration doesn't apply with respect to a broadcaster like
Pacifica*
QUESTION;

Mr* Claibom©, the Department supported

the Commission below, did it not?
•V

MR* CLAIBORNE;

Mr* Justice Powell» that is true»

and that is an embarrassment to us*
k

th©

It's right to say that

matter was handled there by the Antitrust Division rather

than the Criminal Division*

When the matter cam® on for

consideration of a petition for certiorari» tdi© matter was
turned over to the Criminal Division, end its view, shared by

3S
the Solicitor General, was that the judgment below was correct
end that a review ©f it ought not b© sought; and accordingly
w@ did not petition.
W© did not oppose fell© petition, but when fth@ Court
took the case, we deemed it our duty to give this Court the
benefit ©£ our views.

QUESTION: And that has only b©aa tens sines 1966?
Except for the ICC?
MR, CLAIBORNE:

That may b© so, Mr. Justice Whits©,

I don't g© back any further.
QUESTION:

Thank: you.

I'm sorry to take orm minute

of your time.
MR, CLAIBORNE:

In what timo remains, it's perhaps

useful to say that our position is simply this: that vr® construe
»

Section 1464, the only statutae which really is involved in this
case, as ©no that cannot consistently with to© First Amendment
be applied so as to ban absolutely, for any substantial period
of time, the airing of particular words on radio or television,
wholly without regard to circumstances or to fch© context.
That is the limit of our position.
QUESTION;

I’m sorry to keep interrupting, but I

notice toes© words in to® caveat at thrs end of your brief, and
I wonder really whether you think that's a fair characterizatlon
k

of the Commission’s order or its present position.

The

Commission denies it hotly in its reply brief.

Judge Leventhal

didn’t think that was a fair characterization®

is it necessary

to construe what the Commission actually held 3© sweepingly?

39
MR, CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Justice Powell, 2 fear it is.

Judges Leventh&l sought: to save the Commission's order by
narrowing it, and th® Commission rides his coattails.
But th© order, which is what is before th© Court and
not counsel’s representation of it, is very clear that th©
Carlin dialogue was not judged axes-pt only in so far as it
contained certain words.

Those words, regardless of hem? they

were spoken or th© manner in which they were spoken, regardless
©f th© surrounding words, were adjudged by th© Commission t© b©
indecent language.

The definition of indecent language, which

th® Commission gave, was clearly one which did not have any
relation to th© context.
*

They ruled that indecent language

could in no circumstances, except after perhaps ten o'clock
in the evening, be redeemed by its context.
Arid, accordingly, w® s@© no option but to say tea
Commission, and to this extent teay are to b© commended on
their clarity in tee order, has said straightforwardly*

tees©

words, in no circumstances, when children may be in tea audience,
— and s© far as w© can determine that is all th® ‘time — my
b© aired.

And they did not look to th® monologue to see whether

in teat context things might ba different.
*

They said tees® words

recur in that mono log u®, they ax® indecent by our definition,
and accordingly that may not b® don® again,
QUESTIONs

Mr. Claiborne, assume teat, if teis station’s

the Commission refused to renew th® 11cause that on that ground,
and solely upon th® ground that this broadcast has been
antagonistic to the public interest, that that should be

Mr, Chief Jus'tics, I have some,

QUESTIONS

That's right,

MR» CLAIBORNE:

— th@ Commission has soms discretion

in renewal proceedings and perhaps in judging repeating
applicante —
QUESTIONS

They have vary broad discretion, do th@y

not?
MR, CLAIBORNEs

Yes,

I would have submitted, though

it is perhaps beyond th© responsibility of tee Department of
Justice to speak to tela, but I would have submitted that the
Commission may take into account whether th® station has
dev©tad a very substantial portion of its programming to a
kind of material that did not appeal to substantial parts of its

41

audience.

And that, accordingly, its was not in the public

interest to renew that 11 cans© when othor applicante wh© aamt
mor© what th© general public warned were feer© waiting to take
*

the spot.
But I would not think it permissible for the
Commission to focus on an isolated insternas ©£ the broadcast of
this monologue and say feat bad mark will justify our revoking
your license when renewal tiros comes 0
QUESTION; But if fthay did it ones a week for tan
weeks, would you say that was —
MR. CLAIBORNE;

Mr» Chief Justice, I don’t know where

tfc© line is drawn, but I do recognise that the Commission must
k

judge between applicants, and must b© concerned that the station
to whom it’s granted a license does effectively serve fee
public interest, and that must mean serving what most ©f the
public within its reach prefer.

It does not, howcsvsr, in my

submission, allow the Commission, through the back door, to
censor particular programs by saying we can’t forbid it, but
w© can take it into account in failing to renew your license.
That would overstep fee bounds of Section 326.
QUESTION;
k

Well, is it the position ©£ fe© Department

of Justice that under Section 1464 anything go®a?
MR. CLAIBORNE;

Mr. Chief Justice, no.

We —• as we

have tried to explain la to© last portion of our brief —
indicated that in our view, first, if these very words are used

42

ia a way which, though note really fighting words bec&us® th©
confrontation is not face-to-face, nevertheless, are used in a
hostile manner so as to insult the audience generally, ©r &ay
mm in particular, they may be readied under the free speech
analysis.
W© g© further and —
QUESTION s

This case would not include any on® or

more of the words used in a hostile manuar by a fictional
character insulting another fictional character, would it?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Indeed, Mr. Justice Stewart? in

that extent w® say it must b© judged in context.
on'the circumstances.

It depends

Even fighting words, properly so defined,

cannot b© judged as words.

Thai words "fascist" and "racketeer"

in Shapinsky itself axe not banned, it is simply that when they
ax® used face-to-face to an individual, ©von without a
disarming smile, teh®y are likely to pxovok® a breach ©£ the
peace, and accordingly my b® banned ©s fighting words.
Her© we g© further and wo say that if — and we're
concerned hex© primarily about Citizens Band

radio — if some-

on®, ill-advised, attempted to jam the airwaves by the usa of
four-letter words strung out indefinitely, we say that sort of
spewing forth of indecent language, with no conceivable
r©de®raing purpose, could bo reached by Section 1464. And the
indecency provision ©f it.

Because it would not qualify aa

obscenity# since it didn’t appeal to prurient interest.

43
And it’s fer that reason that w© think —
QUESTIONs

You really left out on© part ©£ the

statute# hav©nft you?

Indecent®

MR® CLAIBORNE;

Mr® Chief Justice* 2 meant to say*

if I didn’t* that that would be reached under the indecency
portion ©£ the statute* and it is for that reason 'Shat we think
it important to save something of the separate* as we view it*
indecency prohibition, in te® statute, quite separate from te©

obEeemity provision which of course survives under the Miller
case *
QUESTIONs

Mr® Claiborne* in view of teo standard

teat you propose on tee next-to-last and last page ©f your

peculiarly devoted to children’s programming* and teat the
particular program in white it was included was one aimed at
i

specifically children* wm would* as w© say in our brief* view
that as reachable *
QUESTION;

Would it have to be aimed in a hostile

manner* uttered, not innocently?

MR» CLAIBORNE;

No, Mr. Ju&tic© Powell, I think we

QUESTION;

Yes, you hav® a reference to childran.

MR. CLAIBORNE:

~~ "any radio broadcast spacifinally

diruetsd at younger childran, regardless of the hour" might,
at least, w® think, tentatively b® reached under this statute.
There are definitional problems about what a program aimed
specifically at children would b@, and th®re w® would s@®k the
help ©£ th® Commission in defining a children's program.
QUESTION:

Mr. Claiborne, just to follow up on

Justice Powell'8 question, your conclusion, of course, is quit©
i

tentative in the last paragraph as I re-ad it.

Do I correctly

understand that if w© were to adopt Judge Levenfhal*s view and
say that all that is before us is the broadcast — these words
as broadcast, using his limitation, and we only passed that?
is it the Department’s view that it would not be constitutional
power in the Commission to prohibit this specific broadcast in
this specific tiim and context?
MR. CLAIBORNE;

Mr® Justice Stevens, that would bm

our conclusion. We haven't addressed particularly what arguable
^

redeeming value ther® is in the Carlin monologue, because it
seemed to ue 'feat the Commission*8 order does not address it»
But w@ would point out that that was plainly not a children's

pregram

45

QUESTION: Evan under its general authority that it
relied ©n as an alternative ground to the statutory ground,
you would still say that there is not constitutional power in
answer to Justice» Stevens * question?
MR. CLAIBORNE;

Hell, first, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

1 would ©ay feher© wasn't statutory power because of the anticensorship provision in Section 326.
QUESTION s Right. But ®3 I understand the Commission's
orcter, it also relied upon its general authority, such as it
\

was, outside of the statute.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

That is certainly so, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist.
‘

W© would say. that the only exception to the anticensorship provision with respect to banning a particular
program is what was originally the second section, the second
sentence of that sam® section, that is Section 1424 as it now
i.@t and therefore, anything that's reached under 1464 is —
can be viewed m an exception to the anti-censorship prevision.
But tii® public interest provisions do not, In ©ur view, slim#
the Commission to violata the anti-censorship provision,
ex'cept only in the sene® that if programming is devoted to

t

material that does act serve the public interest to such a
degree, that may bo taken into account at renewal time.
But net a ben.
I've exhausted ary time, Mr. Chief Justice.

MS. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; Do you have anything
furrier, Mr» Marin©?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH A. MARINO, ESQ.,
^

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MARINO;

Just two small points, Your Honor.

May it please the Courts
Yasfearcl&y in hio argument, Mr. Plotkin, and this
morning in hie argument, Mr. Claiborne keep referring to th©
Commission's ordcr as banning, banning, suppressing.

We

thought th® Commission* s order makes it very clear that it
wasn't banning, it wasn't adopting a flat ban, that it was
trying to channel 'this material to periods when there wouldn't
*

b© a reasonable risk
QUESTION2

that children would be exposed to it.
Well, what was it, a suggestion?

I m®an,

i

in dead seriousness, it wasn't an order banning it, it wasn't a

MR. MARINO:

No, it was a declaratory order.

And

what happened is that w© ~
QUESTION;
MR. MARINO:

it was no mor© than a declaratory order?
Absolutely, Your Honor.

The suggestion

that th® Chief Justice mad®, his analogy, a citizen cam© in to
v

th© Commission and said:

These words have been broadcast.

Tek© th© station's license entirely away from them, because
they have abused th® public airwaves.
Th® Commission thought feat feat would not b© fair to

47

even pute than ia hs&ring, ite was oute of teha queaticn,
QUESTIONS

They also thought they'd be violating

teli® censor statute, 'too, didn’t they?
^

MR® MARINO:

If they did that,

32S, Your Honor, prevents ~~ 326 was

written in the Cora-auaicatioas Act, it has two limitations on
it*

No. 1, tell© Co-mission cannot censor.

This section was

written ia 1927, and ate a teimt. when everybody had —
QUESTION:

Couldn’t you hav® considered that when

you -were drafting this order?
MR. MARINO:
QUESTION:
MRo MARINO:
*

We did.

And w® ware certainly aware —-

That’s all 2 said,
Yes,

Yes, Your Hosar.

W® are certainly

aware of 326, we’r© also aware of the language that Mr,
Justice White© put la the Red Lion case about the Commission
suppressing or preventing p®opl® from broadcasting what th@y
want to broadcast.
We are aware ©f 326, w® are aware that, w® axe not in
a position, for example, of a motion picture censoring board
which can say teo a film distributor:

Bring in your product so

we can look ate it,
W© can’t censor, we cannot interfere with the right
y

of free speech by means of radio communication, because that’s
ale© included in 326.

But w@ would add that when Congress

wrote© 326, it quickly added at the end of it that it will hm
unlawful to us© any obscene, lad©cent or profane language by

48

moans of radio communications .
That was written In by tee same peoples who vrrot» the
section in 1927.
^

And so when w© approach th©s® cases, w©

have Congress’s indication in 326 itself that we should concern
ourselves *
W® not only have® the indication in 326, w© have it
in at least three other sections that wa are supposed to ba
'^

concerned and enforce to the limited extent that we can, using
©ur regulatory powers.
I went to respond again, if I can, to Justice
Stevens* question of yesterday»

This declaratory order, Your

Honor, was aimed only at broadcasting, which is a medium *— and
*

when w® say broadcasting, and I 'think everybody recognizes
this, we’r® talking about television, AM and PM radio.

It did

not, address the question of CB, which is a different medium and
raises different problems.
S© teat tee declaratory order was aimed only to
broadcasting, and I think there is no doubt about teat in tee
order.
QUESTIONs

1 understand that, Mr® Maria©»

May I go back to your question of your statement about

where something is indecent, but yet may be protected, the

MR. MARINO:

Well, by censorship, I think 326 takes

the classical censorship, which was prior restraint, a motion

boar in mind that the section was written in 1927.

that th® First. Amendment means

Subsequently this Court has said that

in a limited category you cm, th® motion picture censoring
board may censor.

But we know that w® cannot censor.

Tfc© problem is that broadcasters have traditional

Broadcasters have to broadcast in th® public

MR. MARINO;

We'v® limited

we've loosened the

He’s proposed to speak for his

MR. MARINO?

w© wouldn't have known about it, Your

Honor, because w® don't — w© just don't have funda or we don't

So we would have never known

[Laughter.]
MR® MARINOs

No, Your Honor.

QUESTION s Was it?
MR. MARINOs

No, it wasn't. Your Honor.

But it gave

the Commission an opportunity to give broadcasters son®
guidance, mid it did it in the context of a concrete factual
^

situation.
I want to once again stress, and I don't understand
why th@ United Statos foals that they have to expand the
Commission's order to reach constitutional questions, when it
could have b&an read very narrowly, as it was by Judge
Leventhal, and as it was by the Commissioners, who instructed
us to com© end seek cert before this Court on the basis of
Judg® Leventhal's opinion,knowing that w@ were going to rely
on that ©pinion.

QUESTIONs Well, as 1 understand it, the Solicitor
General has taken the position that this particular broadcast
was protected by the Constitution.

I thought that was the

answer in response to a question by my brother Stevens,

QUESTION:

Do you understand their position

differently?
MR. MARINO*

They still would say that if'you

channel — I think they said if you channeled, in response t®
Mr, Justi,ce Powell, if you channel it out, let’s say Captain
Kangaroo, where you know it's going to get to children, X
can’t; believe that —
)

QUESTION: Well, that’s right, that’s quite differant,
from this broadcast.
MR. MARINO: But what we’re saying is that there’s a
reasonable risk of always reaching children, so it’s a question
of which is «—* under the public interest standard, which is
this more, the better channeling device.
And finally, in conclusion, Your Honor, if I may, I
think we may have inadvertently slighted the alternative theory
that the Commission used in its order, that’s contained at

^

page 18 of the Joint Appendix, and we would also rely on that
and rest on that in submitting this am® to you and asking you
t© revsrs© the judgment of the Court below.
