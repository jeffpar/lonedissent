PROCEED IN G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We will resume arguments

in United States v. New Mexico.
Mr. Carlson.
OPAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN U, CARLSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. CARLSONs
rha Courts

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

My name is John Carlson, Denver, Colorado.

I am

here on behalf of the Twin Lakes Reservoir & Canal company, a
Colorado mutual ditch company.

We are an amicus in this case

and the State of New Mexico has graciously allowed us to
argue because we represent the classic beneficiary for whom
.the national forests were created,
We have a large, for Colorado, small'for the national
forests perhaps, diversion project located on the vary head”
waters of the national forest rivers in Colorado.

It is on

the head-waters of the Colorado River, the Roaring Fork to be
particular, aomo 17 miles above Aspin, Colorado, a watering
spot some of you may know.
That diversion project intersects and gathers water
from scores' of small streams.
Potomac River out there.

We don't have anything like the

W© have streams, some of them when

they aro in full state of flood, are much like a suburban lawn
sprinkler.

We intercept all of these as they go across our

canal and deliver the water into a tunnel that carries forest

water from the Xhi.te Rivor 'National Forest over into the
Arkansas River Valley»
That system was constructed first in 1930, and it
continuously has diverted water with the aid and encouragement
of the Forest Service until very recent times.

We think we

are a representative of th© class for which the national
forests war© created, because Congress said when it passed the
Organic Act in 1897 that th© purpose of the forest w&s* to
secure favorable conditions of flows.

Mow, whan they said

favorable conditions of flows, they weren’t saying flows for
flows sake.

They said we want to provide water for th© people

of the districts, we want to cause there to foe an availability
of water so that the people who are settling in the west can
construct a civilisation.

We have done so.

Th© Forest Service

apparently doesn’t like it -today, but it exists and it is
there and we are frying to protect it.
The importance of this case cannot be under-estimated
when you recognise that in the State of Colorado, 93 percent
of the water that arises in the whole state and flows through
the streams of that state arise on the public lands,,

Of that

98 percent of the water flowing on the public lands and through
our sfr..ama, 95 percent of it canes from the national forests.
So there isn’t any water in Colorado except what occurs in the
national forests*
That statistic is contained in a congressional

31
document celled “The Study and Development, Management and Use
of Water Resources on Public Lands.”

It was prepared for the

Public Land Law Review Commission and is contained in Table 5
of the weekly report.
QUESTION?

2 suppose that would probably bs true of

most of the- other arid states of the west, to a greater or
lesser degree, since fcha forests themselves occur at the higher
levels *
MR. CARLSONt

That is absolutely right, Your Honor.

Hew Mexico's particular statistic is 62 percent £ Arizona's,
Nevada's, Utah's are up in the 90ss, as I recall.

But that

illustrates the importance of the case because we don't have
any water in our streams except what originates out of the
snow pack that falls in the high mountain country.

And when

Congress passed this Act back in the 1890's, they weren't
dummies.

They knew that the west depended on snow packs in

the high mountain country.
in t is

If you retarded the rate of runoff

high mountain country, you would cause a greater

sustained rate of delivery of the water.
Now, they thought that it was important to deliver
water to people for economic utilization.

There is not one

shred of evidence in the statute or 'in the legislative history

or in sixty years of administrativa construction that anyone
v.bought that the Organic Act of 1897 created a reserved water

right for the purposes now claimed by the United States.

QUESTION :

How about any purpose?

MS..» CARLSONs

You meaxi what purpose —

You are going to get around# I suppose#

to indicating whether there is any reserved right and what yon
think the scope ©f it is,
MR» .CARLSON1
tion now# if 1 may.

Your Honor, I will answer that ques­

We think that to the extent the forest,

administrators have a bona fide need for water Jbr something
that falls within the two fundamental overwhelming purposes#
they can have rights to divert water to those purposes.
QUESTION:

Well, what are those?

MR. CARLSON:
QUESTION:

Well# when they —

And how do you measure them?

MR* CARLSON:

You measure them by what the quantifi­

cation is to obtain the purpose.

For example# if they locate

a district headquarters and employ 5,000 people in it# they in
order to run and administer the forests and they located on
forest land# we would concede and grant them a water right to
do that*

That is their administrative need.
QUESTION:

Do you think that — would you say that

the United States would have a right t© any minimum in-stream
flow in the national forests?
MR. CARLSON:
QUESTION:

Hons under the Act of 1897.

Well# a diversion project up above a

for j;7t could totally empty the stream insofar as water that was

33
generated up above the forest without infringing on the United
States reserved water right?
MR. CARLSON:

That's true, and the reason being that

you must identify the purpose for which the forest was created#
it was not created for the wildlife maintenance, it was not
created for habitat eco system maintenance, it was created to
grow trees.

Now, in this --

QUESTIONs

How about fire protection of the trees?

MR. CARLSON:

Absolutely.

If they can prove that

they have a bona fide need for water to protect from fire, they
could get a right to divert.
QUESTION::

How would they do that, if there were

fires?

MR. CARLSONs
QUESTION:

Beg pardon?

How do you prove that, that there were

fires?
MR. CARLSON:

Your Honor, I think that if there is a

fire, people will take the water and put out the fire and no
one in the west has ever objected to that.

What they are

claiming As the right here now — and they didn't offer any
proof at the trial, this Is an afterthought by the United
States on appeal —* they are seeking now the right to maintain
water in the streams in eas© there is a fire some day.

Well,

if there is a fire, they will tell everyone we need water to
put it out.

But you know, the amassing thing is, I don't know

fought with diversions out of the babbling brooks in the high
mountain country.

QUESTION $

Well, X think —

Or am t wrong?

MR, CARLSONs

X think you are wrong, 'four Honor.

The United States has the power to obtain water for any purpose
it needs.

The question is: what did Congress intend- it to ob­

tain in 1897.
QUESTION*

Mr. Carlson, in answer to r.y Brother White

a few moment 3 ago, you sc id;.; you would restrict the doctrine of
reserved' rights for national forests to the two fundamental
statutory purposes, and what are they?
MR. CARLSON.*.

X didn’t get that.

They are to grew trees, to furnish a

continuous supply of timber? second, to secure -favorable con­
ditions of flows, because when they created the forests they
had in mind using that watershed to maximise delivery of waiter
to the private appropriators of the west, and the congressional
history states that tin»® and time again.

So what you are really saying is that

there isn't really any water right out of a stream in a prac­
tical sense for the forests.
ME, CARLSON:
QUESTIONS

Absolutely.

They are de minimis,

Well, that is not trues of —

ME, CARLSON:

But in the west we don't have in this

high mountain forest, we don't have a big free afctophyte
population.

What ws have is Ponderosa pines, and those trees,

I 'think even the Forest Service would acknowledge, obtain a
very significant portion of their moisture from the air.
QUESTION s

With ..respect to free atfcophytes within a

national forest, would -you 'concede the government a reserved
right to the accessary underground flow for the maintenance of
the free attophyfcea?
ME. CARLSON s

If -chat attained the end of furnishing

a continuous supply of timber, yes.

But I do not think that

they can prove that, and -I would hasten to point out in this
case they offered no proof.

They had the burden of

going

forward, they hncl the opportunity to com© forward and state

vf;»yfc their case was, and they never even thought they had a
minimum stream flow right at 'that trial.

The only time they

raised it was on appeal when they asked this Court to receive
evidence end consider this matter on the basis of their argu­
ments.

They had an opportunity to prove this.

We are talking

37
about the fact that they never offered this as a trier of
fact.

Nature dries them up.

There is an incredible variation^stream by stream*
What we are talking about there, too, what you are suggesting t
is a right to divert water.

They want a maintenance, and

what you are saying is maintain the flow of the stream so we

QUESTION:

Well, you are suggesting that you can

dry up the water running through the White River National
Forest.

&o far as a .reserved right is concerned, it would not

be violated if you diverted all of the water out of the
streams running through the White River National Forest.
MR. CARLSONS

I am asserting that, and I submit to

you that it id very much what Congress had in mind, and when
Congress wanted to step a stream from being dried up, it knew
how to do it.

It passed wild and scenic legislation, it has

passed legislation to maintain stream flows, there is a whole
congressional pattern of action that maintains streams in
their natural state.

The most classic example I put to you

is the National Parks itself, where they talked about main­
taining this esthetic sensibility.

argument.

Mr. Carlson, I am really puzsled by your

Perhaps it just reveals my lack of understanding of

water law,, but I thought you conceded that there was son'© kind
of reserved right in the United States for the two basic pur­
poses , one to maintain same kind of flow of the water, and yet
you also seem to say that notwithstanding that reserved right,
the state could authorise appropriation of 100 percent of the
water upstream of the forest.
MR. CARLSON *

Are you saying that?

No, I don't think so.

I am saying

that whatever right the United States has by virtue of its
reserved right, and that right must be quantified, then they
can caus'5 there to be remaining in the stream that quantity of
water so they can take it and use it.

And if that is an in­

flow right for :;osie purpose which they have not yet proved,
that quantity will remain in the stream.
QUESTION:

But is it only a quantity -to b© measured

It/ what they want to divert from the stream, or do they have

any right at all to have water continue to flow-through the
forest?

they had no right, for the purposes of wildlife maintenance or

MR. CARLSON *

It wasn’t designed to create a right

l.nd the perfect confirmation of that, Your Honor, is the

statute, the part of .the Organic Act in which it says all
waters, not some? waters, not 10 percent of the waters, not 90
percent of the waters, it says all waters arising on the
national forests may be appropriated for domestic milling,
mining, and irrigation use*

We have never had a national system.

So you have an express grant.

interpreted the creation' of''the national forest's as an act of
appropriation.
QUESTION:

a water right.

MR, CARLSON:

Tou have never addressed the question

of how the forests and for what purposes they were created.

MR. CARLSONWhen they created the forests, they
said w© are creating the forests for these two purposes and if
there are .water needs peculiar to the United. States inherent

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. MOORMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MOORMANS

~ REBUTTAL

Mr, Chief Justice, end may it pleas©

the Courts
Mr. Carlson started his argument by stating that the
national forests supply 95 percent of the water in bis state,
which I believe is true.

But I want to point out to you that

the Forest Service intends to use only one-half of one percent
of that water for consumptive use, and I invifca your attention

to the appendix to our reply brief, where there is a letter
from Mr, McGuire, so virtually all of that water will be avail­
able and is available' for the economic uses of the west.
QUESTION*

Mr. Moorman, 1 suppose you will agree

that there,is not enough water to go around and that it may
well be that your water claims, if they are sustained, will
mean that there is lass water available for water rights that
have already bean appropriated.or that have been appropriated?
MR. MOORMAN :
QUESTION:

Yes.

Otherwise we wouldn’t have the amicus

briefs from this gentleman.* s clients or from others her® that
— they think their appropriated rights are going to be cut
into.
ME. MOORMANS

There are two problems, Your Honor.

First of all, I think there is an inordinate fear «*QUESTION:

First, isn’t that a fact?

MR. MOORMAN:

Yes, Your Honor, but there is an .in­

ordinate! fee.:, of the else of the future needs of the national
forests which I think are laid to rest by the letter from the
Chief of the Forest Service which is attached to our brief.
The second thing is sort of an allocation thing.
Mr. Carlson*s client, a trans-basin diverter, he wants to take
the water very high on the stream out of the river basin it­
self info another basin, so it is sort of an allocation
question with regard to him.

The water if it stays in the

47
forest will be available for economic use.

It may not simply

be available to his client.
QUESTION %

four consumptive use point though,- it

doesa' t really answevr tha in-stream flow matter because if
you are entitled to maintain a minimum stream flow, that is a
whole lot different matter than consumptive us®.
MR. MOORMAN§
QUESTION %

Yea, but if we maintain —

And it certainly would prevent people

from taking out too much water above tha forest.
MR. MOORMANS

Above the forest, that's correct, but

the water will be eventually available as it leaves the forest
for economic use and development and therefore from the stand­
point of tha total amount of water available for the develop-»
merit of the west, the effect will be da minimis.

It will have

an effect on where certain points of diversion can ha and
where it can be used, but that it seems to me is not as signifi
cant a fact as 'the fact that the actual amount available will
be virtually all of the water from the national forests, all
but half of one pereant»
QUESTION:

X take it there wouldn't be any problem

hers .if there was enough -unappropriated water to satisfy your
needs.and satisfy other appropriated rights, 'too?
MR. MOORMANs

I think that is correct, but I do

think that the effect sf the Forest Service right on most
appropriated uses in (.he west is not — is de minimis, it is.

48
When yon find unudual situations like the Tv;dn Lakes people
who want to take water across the divide, you have a serious
effect.
QUESTIONs

I take it that reasonable men and men of

good-will could differ with you and they must be differing
with you and have a different view if they are going to take
the rather strong and earnest positions that they take in this
ease.
MR. MOOHMANs

That5 s quite possible that they do

disagree with m.3, and I don*t disagree with that. Your Honor.

I would like to make another point, if I may, in my brief
time, which is that: New Mexico and the amicus have suggested
that the sole: reason that the state court denied rights to instream flows was be.cause we failed to prove any need for those
rights, and we believe this misreads the state -rulings.
The? state courts did not deny the U.S. minimum inafcream flows because of any failure of proof.

Quite to the

contrary, they stated as flatly and as unequivocably as could

be done that we were not entitled to any minimum in-stream
flow as a matter of law.

The stats district court wrote that

the United States does not have reserved rights to minimum instream flows based upon the purpose for which the"Gila Forest
lands wore or cm,11 have' been withdrawn from the public domain,
and the Supreme Court affirmed, stating that in-stream flows
were not contemplated by the Organic Act, and I refer the Court

49
to appendix 231 and page 241.

And as a last word I will simply

say that vm requested permission to present additional evidence
after the state objected to the in-stream flow after the
evidence closed and we were denied that right.
s

Mr. Moorman, don’t you think all of the

objection to your position is kind of a springing use
character of the claim that the government makes 'that it is
.5 percent now but under your theory it could be 20 percent
by 1990?
MR. MOORMANS

1 think that is the origin of the

fear, Your Sonor, that we have a right to future needs.

But

what is happening I think will lay that to rest, because the
Chief’s letter which wo attach encompasses the total present
and foreseeable national forest water needs, so the .5 percent
includes al.' present and future needs, and in water adjudica*
tions W2 are quantifying not only our present but our future
nerds in canes like this, so the fact of the matter is that
.5 percent is the future needs of the forests as can be —
QUESTIONs

Can this Chief bind a future Chief?

MR. MOORMAN*

Ho, but the courts that adjudicate

these rights —
QUESTION3

The adjudication can, you take it?

MR.. MOORMAN %

The adjudication will, and we are

going to present those rights for our futuro needs and in ray
opinion in a decade the adjudications will bo over virtually

50
ia the west, in a decade and a half.
Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.
