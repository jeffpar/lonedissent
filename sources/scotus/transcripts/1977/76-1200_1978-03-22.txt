proceedings
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll hear arguments first

this morning in Crist against Cline»
Mr. Keller, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. KELLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. KELLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
You will recall this matter was remanded to be
rebriefed and reargued on two eupanded issues, and the first
issue is whether or not the federal rule that jeopardy attaches
in jury trials when the jury is sworn

is constitutionally

mandated.
I think, after reading the briefs in this thing, that
we can fairly well agree without arguing that at the time of
the Constitution it was not constitutionally mandated, and it was
not a part of the Constitution» There were two common law rules
at that time, Lord Coke's rule and the double-jeopardy rule?
and when we get to as far as Perez, Perez in the touchstone case
of manifest necessity says this is not a Fifth Amendment
consideration, this is not double jeopardy»
Perez was going into the question of whether or not
it's permissible to take away that defendant's right to a jury,
once the jury is empaneled and sworn? Lord Coke's rule mad® in
mandatory that you go clear through to verdict»

4
But: it clearly at that time was not a part- nor
considered a part of the Fifth Amendment.
It doesn't become that until, in various jurisdictions,
in construing the rule of practice or Lord Coke’s rule, that
were dismissals.

There were improper dismissals, and they held

the improper dismissal to be tantamount to a jury verdict.
And, as a consequence of that, then there was jeopardy under
tiie Fifth Amendment.
QUESTION:

And the —
The original concept of the common law,

there could be no such thing as a failure of a jury to reach a
verdict, isn’t that correct?

They'd lock them up on bread-and™

water, and they would come back with a verd:i ct one way or the
other.
MR. KELLER:

This did happen, yes.

You don’t see any

changes in that until Blackstone does bring out the words,
whenever there may be evident necessity, but it took a real
necessity, a juror had to die.

Hung juries are the things that

gave them all their problems.
QUESTION: There was no such thing as a hung jury in
the concept of early common lav;, was there?
MR. KELLER:

No.

Ironically, no.

And in the

?

Commonwealth cs.se, Commonwea 1 th v. Clew in Pennsylvania, and
I'm talking about cases that were all decided back between
1800 and 1820,

They upheld Lord Coke's rule, and that jury

had gone 36 hours

24 without food or drink; two jurors, 75

5

years of age or older, who had just: gotten out of the hospital,
were in trouble. And the doctor looked at them and said, if
they have some food or drink, something, they can go on.
So the judge permitted the jury to vote on it, and the jury
said, No, don't give it to them.

And obviously they had them

hanging on the ropes.
And the judge finally let them off the hook, and
dismissed the jury, and then the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
held;

No, -this was improper-, and freed the defendants

they ought not to be.

And they took a strict reading of Lord

Coke's rule.
This gets commented on, not only later by ms, but
when I start talking about the Arizona v. Washington case and
I wonder if — whether or not we ought to be here today, in
the face of that case, that opinion.

But that case recites

the reason why you don't keep a jury under that pressure, and
certainly there's a humane thought on it.
QUESTION;

Was there an earlier time when, even after

an acquittal, prosecutions were brought again and again until
a verdict was obtained?
MR. KELLER;

This is recited back during the reign

of the Stuarts, Mr. Chief Justice, and Lord Coke’s rule would
have come down early in the 1600's, and between that time and
1688, you would have had the reign of two kings, the Stuarts,
and at that time, yes, there were re-prosecutions until the

6

prosecution could gat; a sufficient case together/ and it was
horribly abused.

You know, -the history, as I read it, is as

of the Revolution in 1608, they went back to Lord Coke’s rule,
and we didn’t have that occurring any more.
On the second part of your question, if there ware
an acquittal, would there be a reprosecution, short of the
reign of the Stuarts, and I don’t know the answer to that,
because that comes up near a case that we know of no time when
there was ever an acquittal and a reprosecution.

And, as a

consequence of that, whether it was by rule of court or whatever
the rule, as a consequence of the acquittal, then the doublejeopardy application of the common law came into effect.
And I can't answer it.

I know of no case where there has been

an acquittal and & reprosecution.

But I wasn't researching

from that standpoint, either.
When we researched this and found that the time of
jeopardy at common lav/ as at the time of verdict, of the jury,
ther® wasn't any question in our mind, one, nobody today is
going to go back that far in time and say that jeopardy does
not attach until the® time of the verdict, as it was at the
common lav/.

And we felt that, for the simple reason that we

had too much lav; since then, particularly combining manifest
necessity with double jeopardy; and two, fundamentally, it was
just unconscionable that you can put a defendant to the blade,
you can commit his defenses and still not say that jeopardy

attaches„
But we had real problems in briefing this, in getting
the vehicle to com© forward from the time of tile judgment up to
where we want to be today.

We didn't know what the vehicle was»

And then came Arizona v, Washington. And the vehicle
is the valued-right concept.
Downum in 1963, Justice Tuttle in the Ninth Circuit,
in this case said that Downum has to stand for the proposition
that jeopardy attaches at the time that the jury is sworn.
And the reason that Downum stands for that is because that case
involved a case where, after the jury was sworn and before the
first witness was sworn, the case ended.

They didn't have

their witnesses for Counts 6 and 7 and the trial was terminated.
And from that, Justice Tuttle says, Downum necessarily
stands for this position.

And I submit that when you read

Arizona v. Washington today, you have to come out with th© sama
conclusion®
Arizona v« Washington said this was an improper open­
ing statement by counsel, in this cas© defense counsel, but
made at a time between the swearing of the jury and before the
first witness.
The fact that •• two witnesses testified in that case
are really incidental to the opinion.

Th© rationale is th©

valued-right concept goes back to the time of opening state­
ments and that, of necessity, is before the time that the first

3
witness was sworn.
So, reading this case, as you read Downurn, you have
t.o say Arizona v, Washington stands for this proposition.

And

«
that means that the only thing that we can really argue today
to this Court is that wa don't

feel that the valued-right

concept means all of that, and we're not sura that that's what
this Court meant when it said that.
And the reason that I say that is that this Court was
particularly careful in the opinion not to say that.

Arizona

v. Washington was argued the day before we argued the last time,
so it was pending during the 'time that our case was pending,
and much of what was said in Arizona v. Washington comes out of
the briefs that we submitted in this case.

So that we know

that the Court was conscious of this case when the opinion was
written.

And yet the Court assiduously did not say jeopardy

attaches eb the time that the jury is sworn.

So we don't know

what we're talking about in terms of valued right, as the
vehicle for bringing

jeopardy from the time of verdict up to

some starting point in time.
If you read the reasons for the valued right in the
Arizona, case, then you find that it's to avoid financial
emotional burden, a re-trial that cons this, you find it's to
avoid the prolongation of the period of stigma, and it may even
enhance risk that an innocent defendant may be convicted.
That means if you read it literally you could even be

9

going back to the time that you first select the panel from
which you're going to voir dire.

We don't know where the

starting point is on file valued-right concept»
We do know, it also has been argued under the valued
right, that this valued right is a right to a particular
tribunal.

And that’s expressed as early as 1R40 in United

States v. Shoemaker.

It's Lord Coke’s rule.

You're entitled

to tills panel, this particular jury.
And it also has been argued that the valued right
means that anything 'that goes to that jury, whether it's in the
voir dire questioning, whether it's in the opening statement,
anything that does something to that tribunal makes that tribunal
valuable.
Serf ass, United Sfcat.es v. Sgrfass, held that the
constitutional policies underpinning the Fifth Amendment are
not implicated until jeopardy attaches.

Serfass also held that

this Court has consistently adhered to the view that jeopardy
docs not- attach until the defendant is put to trial before the
trior of the facts, jury or non-jury»
And then Serfass held, in two different places,
without risk of determinationfguilty, jeopardy does not attach.
Wow, if we read the Sarfas_s case in conjunction with
Arizona v. Washington, then we're saying that clearly jeopardy
does not attach before the time the jury is sworn, and no later
than the tine that the first witness is sworn.

And we have

10
at least narrowed it clown to that point.
If we go back to those pointsr then, then when we
talk about the financial and emotional burden that was expressed
in the Arizona case, that's not applicable,.to that narrow period
of time.

What difference are we talking about in finances or

©motions between the time the jury is sworn and the time Idle
first witness is sworn?
The second reason given is the prolonging of the
stigma*

And that distinction is gone» Surely, we are not
I

■

talking about a prolonging of a stigma between the time fch©
jury is sworn and the first witness is sworn.
And the last is enhancing the risk of conviction of
an innocent nan.

And that can't happen until the first witness

is sworn.
QUESTION:

In Montana, is it customary for both

counsel to male© their opening statements before the first witness
is called?
MR. KELLER:

No, sir.

I want to gat to that. And

•the unfortunate part about it, and -that's wher© you have all of
the advantage, I can only tell you of my practice in Montana.
And it is twenty years of trial on both sides and on the bench.
And it's uncommonly rare that defensa counsel says anything
in the beginning.

I have never heard a defense counsel say

anything in the beginning that the pros@cuti.on didn't already
know.

Th© only 'thing that they say is something they want that

11
jury to hear, which the prosecution already knows. And they
want the jury to keep a fair mind on something, an open mind,
as the sordid facts com® out.
QUESTION: And sometimes they want the jury to focus
on

one point.
MR. KELLER:

That’s conceivable.

You usually pick

that up in the voir dire, to tell you the truth.

I do.

It’s

there. That’s right.
But at least we have reached the point that we are
not going to hold constitutionally that somebody is entitled to
anything less than a fair jury, so that what you've done to
that jury in the voir dire isn’t something that’s entitled to
protection.
And this gets to the point that I was reaching. The
real concept of a valued right to me,as any trial lawyer knows,
that when, that defendant goes through a re-trial, let's say a
hung jury so we don't have any problem there, h© really has the
odds against him.

This was brought out in the Arizona case,
?

by Judge Leventhal in the Carsj.e case, and Judge Leventhal
pegged it.

The second time through those witnesses whose

weaknesses were developed by cross-examination by defense in
the first case, they started to shore-up their testimony.

It's

not a significant alteration, but it's there.
And I have yet to see the defendant go through a re­
trial that everything didn't change.

All of the surprise is

12
gone. The prosecution knows whore he’s gone after the first dry
run. The prosecution doesn't know that in the first case. They
have to be prepared against anything this defense counsel will
do.

The second run. there's no spontaneity, there's nothing.

That defendant has an impossible burden that second time, he
really does.
And this is the reason why — I thought about this
after the argument last time.
as a matter of law and as

You know, I argued to you then

a matter of fact that the defendant

is not in jeopardy until something comes out that makes out a
prima facie case. And I was arguing from
risk

Serfass, without

of determination of guilt.
But I thought about this afterwards, and I thought,

you know, really, from the time that the defense counsel makes
his first objection or does not make his objection as a matter
of strategy, that defense is committed, that's when they have
really gone in and exposed their hand to tee prosecution.

And

from that point on, that defendant does have a valued right to
get this matter heard by this jury and by this judge, by
whatever, because now, for th© first time, when he didn't have
to, h© has tipped his hand, and now his concern is interest, is
there, is important.
Or, as was said in Jorn, in defining this same valued
right, if the right is valued it is because the defendent has
a significant interest in tee decision of whether or not to talc©

13

it from the jury*
And I submit until the time that the defense counsel
has done something in this case that tips his hand to the
prosecution, up until that point it's not the -type of interest
that’s so significant that deserves constitutional protection»
But from that point on, it is»
Rather than try and find out in any given case when
that is, then at the time evidence is given is

you know it’s

right affer that in any given cess, that that defense
QUESTION:

Well, it could be if, against the usual

policy, defense counsel makes his argument to the jury»
MRC KELLER:
QUESTION:

It certainly could»
It could» Then he is committed?

MR» KELLER:
QUESTION:

That's right.
In other words, that would work committal,

'wouldn't it?
MR. KELLER:

That’s right.

The problem with that rational© is I just, one, don't
sas that point, —
QUESTION:

They don't do it.

MR. KELLER:

— but if we're going to say that that’s

what it takes to put jeopardy, I expect we'll start seeing it.
But that same defense counsel could tell the prosecution three
weeks before that:

This is what I have up ray sleeve.

And I can't imagine him telling it to him three weeks

14
before,, any no re than I can see a competent defense counsel
tipping to the prosecution
QUESTION:

Well, I think the difference is that,

one, he's in the presence of the court and ha's stuck with it?
and if he just tells the prosecutor, he's not stuck with it.
MR. KELLER:

Oh, I see what you mean.

Well, that's

true, by

QUESTION:
MR. KELLER:

Wouldn't he be?
Yes, yes, he necessarily is.

He could

do it for the record three weeks before if he would want to, -™
QUESTION: Right. Right.
MR. KELLER;
really doesn't.

— but, as a practical matter, no.

He

And it isn't a case of giving the prosecution

a week to get ready.

No defense counsel gives the prosecution

five minutes to get ready, if they can avoid it.

You don't

tell them some filing they don’t know until it's your turn to put
on your case, and than it comes. And I just simply, and I have
to speak empirically, I don't sea defense counsel 'telling the
prosecution any'tiling any sooner than they have to.
When they make an opening statement, the/ don't tall
him anything the prosecution doesn't know? they're just telling
a jury what to expect.

But the prosecution knows this.

QUESTION: As I understood you earlier, you told us
that in your state of Montana it's not the practice to have
opening statements.

15
MR. KELLER;

No.

Mr. Justice Stewart.

I didn’t answer that properly# then,

It is, but not at the time of

to the taking of testimony.

prior

The defense counsel —

QUESTION: Then, when are they made?
MR. KELLER:

— usually reserves his opening state­

ment# he has the right to make it then# and he asks — he says,
"I’m going to reserve".

And when the prosecution has rested#

and the defense is now ready to open its case# then lie makes
his opening statement.
QUESTION:
MR. KELLER:

I ses.

After ~

That's long after witnesses for the

prosecution have —
QUESTION:

After th© prosecution witnesses have all

testified# and -the prosecution has rested, —
MR. KELLER:

That’s correct.

The case-in-chief is

in.

statement —
MR. KELLER:
QUESTION:
MR. KELLER:

— makes his opening statement.
— to the jury.
That’s correct.

Nov?# he has made it before# but he has never —
QUESTION: But that's —
MR. KELLER:

— I have never heard him make it -that

h© tells tlie prosecution any tiling.

It’s only for th© benefit

16
of that: jury going through this particular . the defense knows
what the prosecution is going to give? if he did his homework
at all, he knows what the witnesses have.

And he’s telling

this jury at that time wh&fc to anticipate and, in essence, 15to
keep your minds open", but he's not telling the jury anything
til at the prosecution doesn't already know.
And it's that tipping of the defense that I think
makes anything subsequent to that value3 to -that defendant.
QUESTION: When, if at all, Mr. Keller, does the
prosecutor make his opening statement, in your practice?
In Montana.
MR. KELLER:

Well, he makes his statement as such

after the swearing of tie jury and before the swearing of the
first witness.

But there is, in various jurisdictions, various

judges before the State, there is some opening remark made at
the time you first pick the panel of 24 that you're going to
cut down to 12. So that they at least know who the defendant
is, what he's charged with, and that sort of tiling.
QUESTION: Well, that's part of 'the voir dire, isn't
it?
MR. KELLER:
QUESTION:

Yes.
So he can ask them, "Do you know the

defendant?" or the -~
MR. KELLER: And the prosecutor who starts first may
well be the one —• the judges don't enter that actively in the

17
questions, the parties do it, as distinguished from the federal
court where the judge literally conducts all of . the voir dire
in our State,
QUESTION:

Well, don't the Montana judges, at the

time of the filing of the venire into the box, make some vary
brief statement that:

This is a criminal case, and that such-

and-such i.s the charge, and that sort of thing?
MR, KELLER:

Yes.

And it varies with judges.

Almost, all of them do at least that.

Some will go through a

preliminary half-dozen questions, "These are the counsel and
the parties; do you know them?"

And gets those questions out

of the way in general. And if they do, they hold their hand up,
and they leave it up to the counsel to interrogate further.
QUESTION:

Mr. Keller, when actually is the jury sworn?

After selection, or is the panel sworn?
MR. KELLER:

It's initially sworn when it's picked,

to tall the truth as to the answers that are given, but when
— that’s the whole panel.
QUESTION: That's the whole venire?
MR. KELLER:
QUESTION;

That's correct.
The whole venire.

That’s before the 12

are chosen?
MR. KELLER:
QUESTION;
•they then again sworn?

Exactly.
And then after the 12 are chosen, are

IB
MR. KELLER: Sworn, again, yes, sir.
QUESTION: And til at is to well and truly try.
MR, KELLER:
QUESTION:

Right.

That's right.

And what we're talking about here is

actual swearing ~~
MR. KELLER:

There are three kinds of swearing.

The first swearing is that they are going to tell the truth as
to the questions asked generally, as to whether they are qualified
even to be jurors, in general.
QUESTION: Right.
MR. KELLER:

Then they have another oath that they

ar® going to answer the questions asked in this particular causa
by counsel, as to their respective qualifications.
QUESTION:
that?

Is that each -- each on© individually does

Do you swear each one individually?
MR. KELLER:
QUESTION:
MR. KELLER:

No, sir.
No,?

No, sir, never.

Okay, I see.

In fact, the matter of practice is to

swear everyon© in the courtroom the first time.

It’s the

first 'time they've been down to court, and they have to ba
qualified.

Then, from that you pick your panel for that day,

and you usually pick 24 for a trial of 12, because you have
enough preemptories going in -there, you want to be -- when you'r ;
all done, you want to have 12 left.
take it back

You have 20 in there, I

19
And they stand up and take the oath, but so do the
remaining jurors in the courtroom, because they may well be
called into this case, if somebody is out for cause» And -that’s
to answer the questions in this case.
But

when you finally get the 12, and the alternates,

if there's going to be any, those 12 or 14 stand up and now are
sworn a third time»
QUESTION:

But this first oath is essentially like

the oath given witnesses, merely to tell the truth?
MRoKELLER:

Yes, sir.

The first two oaths are that,

and I don't think anybody has ever contended that that has
anything to do with, what we're talking about.

We're talking

about swearing this final body of 12 to —
QUESTION:

And that is the swearing as to which it is

claimed jeopardy attaches?
MR, KELLER:
QUESTION:
MR0 KELLER:
to mean that

That's correct,
Only that, not the preliminary swearing,
That's the on© that I surely construe

that's historically the time when that jury

is sworn, when -QUESTION: Well, some have argued that jeopardy ought
to attach earlier.
\

MR. KELLER:

Yes.

Yes. Because of what is said to

that jury in the voir dire that it should,
QUESTION:

Exactly.

20
MR. KELLER:

Yes» And our position on til at is

consistent with the Arizona case, and we cite in our brief
Morris, where you are just not entitled to a prejudiced jury.
The real function of the selection at that time is to come out
with 12 jurors that are fair-minded and impartial. And it may
I

well be that, as a defense counsel, I'd like to have some
sleepers on there, that may well be as a prosecutor I'd like
that, but it's a far cry to say that it's entitled to
constitutional protection.
So, theoretically, we're supposed to be coming out
with 12 impartial people, and we have no particular interest in
that tribunal other than the fact that they be impartial.
QUESTION:

You have indicated that it would make
t

sense to have the point at which jeopardy attaches be when the
defendant has committed himself, or it makes a difference in
switching the tribunal.
Are the reasons for moving the point at which
jeopardy attaches back from the present rule that attaches when
the jury is sworn, back to there, significant enough to overr

come the interest in having settled law remain clear and
definite and certain.

There's some advantage, everyone now

knows what tee rule is.
MR. KELLER:

Do. you think it's the change?
Settled law didn't become settled lav;

until -~
QUESTION s

No, but it’s settled today, 1 would think

21
I1R. KELLER:

until 1963, well over a century and a

half, almost, two centuries after we started,
first enunciated the

Wade v. Hun tar

valued-right concept, a century and a

half after ve started; and, I might add,in a non-jury case.
And now it's settled. But it really didn't become this until
'69, because it wasn’t settled in Montana, it wasn't settled
in any of the States until Benton v. Maryland in ’69,

It's

settled in the minds of the federal judiciary, because it's
been around for a long time.
But it hasn’t been with the others.

As far

back —

or as recently as 1935, the ALI is recommending that jeopardy
not attach until verdict of the jury, where it was in the
beginning.

So to us it’s not settled.
And my question is, have we afforded protection for

this defendant under any guise by saying it attaches at the same
time as it does in a non-jury case?

Excuse me, sir.

QUESTION: Well, as I understood you, your point is
that — this point of law — that something happens when the'
jury is empaneled and sworn.

It wasn't ever really part of -the

double jeopardy clause at all, it was part of quite a different
rule that a person is entitled, once a jury is empaneled and
sworn, to go to trial with that jury, and to go a final con­
clusion of the trial in that way.
MR. KELLER: Civil or criminal.
QUESTION:

Civil or criminal.

And that that has a

22
different origin from the — and is unrelated to double
jeopardy clause.
MR. KELLER:
QUESTION:

Double jeopardy — that is correct,
Mr. Keller, getting back to when you were a

judge, I'd think more so than 'the jury, couldn't defense
counsel commit himself on cross-examination?
MR, KELLER:

Yes,

That's why I agree with the rule

attaching to the swearing of the first witness.
QUESTION:
MR. KELLER:

I see.
Because I think when that first witness

for the prosecution starts to testify, the defense counsel
commits himself by objecting, even before cross-examination, —
QUESTION: Right.
MR. KELLER:

— by objecting to a question, or, for

strategy reasons, not objecting to testimony, /it that point he
is in this thing —
QUESTIONs
MR. KELLER:

Once he gets in —

objection — and I don't mean it really because of Montana

Sure, I want to see •— I think we have

afforded protection. But just in terms of trying to figura out
where this ought to be, and be something that's going to protect
the defendant's right across-the-board and not just in a given
State, I can see it attaching that soon. Because at that point
the defense counsel is starting to put something into this case

MR. KELLER:

No, he really —

QUESTION: That’s been worrying me for the last week.
MR. KELLER:

Yes, I know.

I know that he has certainly

got to do his work. But he’s got to do his work when his client
came in -the office. And you go back to the time that the
information is filed, and you see efforts on that time to
question whether or not the affidavit for leave to file is
correct, or you question whether or not, before a Justice of
the Peace, probable causa was sown, and caused a transcript to
be made. And you’ve argued that. And that's all part of the
tools of trade.
But the real question is:
then?

No, he really hasn't, because if he doesn’t do it then,

he's not going to be able to do it.

So that’s just part of

QUESTION:
the trial?

And he could shift it all entirely at

He could change his own strategy by the time of

trial?
MR. KELLER:

Of courses he could.

QUESTION: Why should the so-called valued-right of
the defendant to go to trial before the first jury depend
entirely on when the defendant's lawyer has committed himself,
as you put it?
MR. KELLER:

Because I don't think his right is that

valued until that point.

Lord Coke’s rule — if you’ve read

any of -the biographies on Lord Coke, he never gave any reasons
for his rules.

If they took out all of the rules that he gave

with no reason, they would lose 75 percent of the English lav/.
[Laughter. ]
MR. KELLER:

But his rules have been good, so how do

v/© find out what the reason is that gave -this valued right?
And that’s where we cam© into this case, —*
QUESTION: Well, what I’m asking you to do is to
perhaps do what Lord Coke didn’t, and supply a reason for the
statement you make that the commencement of the defendant's
valued right begins with the point when the defendant's counsel
has committed himself.
MR. KELLER:

Why should that be?
Because once he has tipp©d his hand to

the prosecution on something that the prosecution does not
know where he's going to go, then if he gets a re-trial on that

25

point;, there's nothing left for the defense to have.
a — it's already bean run. There's no spontaneity.

It's just
The second

trial ~~ and I used an example where there is a hung jury, so
it is a clear rerun of the whole show.

And that defendant's

chances at that time, Justice Rehnquist, are just simply
zilch.

There’s no secret. The prosecution knowswhere the

defense counsel is going.

Those witnesses that were there to

testify that the defense counsel shredded on cross-examination,
now get the shading that's indicated by Judge Leventhal in the
p

Caraia case, and it's just a different trial. And the
defendant's chances are seriously enhanced —
QUESTION;

Yet, with many hung jury cases, that's

the classical reason for granting a mistrial and permitting the
prosecution to start over again.
MR. KELLER;

Yes.

I know that.

Because there is

no reasonable alternative. The alternative, as pointed out in
the Arizona case and prior to that, is you're going to put some
sort of influence in those jurors to come with some verdict
rather than a mistrial, and that's not fair.
But just because we don't like that aspect of it
I read this in the valued-right definition, or reasons given
in the Arizona case, this possibility thatyou may convict an
.innocent man, that's where it comes. Because it's teat chance
teat he's going to tip his defense, and then it runs again.
And teat may well be an innocent man.

26

I don’t; see anything significant about the
defendant's right or any tiling else until that point when he
has tippad his hand.
QUESTION: And you say that nover occurs until the
first witness i3 called?
MR. KELLER;

It can't occur until that time, unless

ha wants to voluntarily go out and do something to tip his
hand, which v;ould include making an opening statement of what
he's tipping.
QUESTION:

And he can always save that opening

statement in both federal and in Montana courts until he's
ready to open?
MR. KELLER:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
Mr. Keller, can I ask you one more

You said at the outset that —- of course you didn’t

have the benefit of Arizona v. Washington when you filed your
brief, and that if you had, that kind of decides the whole case.
But do you think Arizona, v. Washington helps you or hurts you?
I'm not quite sure I understand your position.
MR. KELLER:

I don't know, either.

[Laughter.3
QUESTION:
MR. KELLER:

Oh, okay.
I wanted to make that clear.

I said that;

you could read this later the same way Downum is being read to
say, well, if it happens when tee prosecutor made his opening

statement:, that's before my point in time, and we're .in trouble.
But, on the other hand, this Court had to know tills case was
pending, and this Court did not say, as it has said i.n the past,
that jeopardy attaches when the jury is sworn.
7md when you assiduously did not say that, I have to
believe that you're leaving open this vary question we're here
today on? and I think that hinges on what is the valued right,
and when should it have constitutional protection.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Keller.

Mr. Caller,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF TIIE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. GELLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
With the Court's permission, there are two issues in
this case that I don't intend to discuss.
of manifest necessity.

First is the question

We noted in our opening brief the
f-

record in this case3! doesn't permit a determination of a number
of factors essential to a resolution of the manifest necessity
issue.

Since it doesn't indicate whether appellees resisted

the amendment of Count 2 of the initial information, or whether
they objected to the dismissal of that count, or to the
dismissal of the remaining count.
In any event, -the State appears to have abandoned that

28

issue in this Court,
The second question that I don’t plan to address at
any length is whether the State should be free to adopt a rule
for the attachment of

jeopardy that differs from the rule

applicable in federal courts.

It is not a matter in which the

federal government has a subs tanti al interest.
It is our view, however, that there is little to
justify a disparity in the rule as applied in State and federal
courts.

The double-jeopax'dy prohibition of the Fifth Amendment,

of course, is fully enforcible against, the States through the
Fourteentli Amendment, and the time when jeopardy attaches would
appear to be an essential ingredient of the double-jeopardy
guarantee rather than a mere incidental or procedural feature
'that may be varied without doing damage to the basic
constitutional right,
QUESTION:

You are mors or less just volunteering this,

that it’s of no concern to the United States as a litigant,
1 take it?
MRo GELLER:

Well, the issue that’s of concern to the

United States is when does jeopardy attach as a matter of
constitutional law, if the Court were to hold that the States
may be free to vary it, that portion of the Court’s opinion
v/ould be of no substantial interest to the United States,
I v/ould like to limit my discussion then to the
essential question posed by the Court in its order of December

29

5th. That is, when, as a natter of constitutional mandate, does
jeopardy attach?
And, at common law, as Mr. Keller has indicated,
indeed even today in England, jeopardy did not attach until the
verdict.
The historical record leaves little doubt that this
was the understanding of the Framers of the Fifth Amendment,
ad that the double-jeopardy clause was not originally intended
to bar the reprosecution of a defendent whose first trial was
aborted, for whatever reasons, prior to verdict.
Despite this background, it's settled today that the
double-jeopardy clause is more than a mere constitutionalization
of res judicata principles, plus a prohibition of government
appeals from acquittals.

The clause also protects the

defendant's "valued right", this Court has said on a number of
occasions, "to have his trial completed once it's begun"0
In other words, a right to go to verdict and perhaps to and
the dispute then and there wi.fch an acquittal.
Obviously,in order to protect the defendant's
interest in receiving the verdict of the first facie-finder and
hence avoiding repetitive trials, jeopardy must attach at some
point prior to the verdict.

The question, then, is:

At what

point in a criminal proceeding does the defendant's interest
in going forward with the trial to its completion, and in not
being required to begin anew., become sufficiently substantial

30

to support the conclusion that jeopardy has attached,

And,.

accordi-ngly, that subsequent trial terminations must be judged
under the unyielding requirements of the double™jeopardy clause.
In fixing this point, we believe that the Court should
t

be guided by three considerations.
The first consideration, which was alluded to
earlier by Mr. Justice Stevens, is that the time of attachment
of jeopardy should represent the bright line.

This is an

area in which the need for certainty and predictability is
©specially important? unless the point at which the defendant
has been placed in jeopardy can ba identified with precision
in every trial, judges would be forced to guess as to the
propriety of terminating the proceedings prematurely,, in a
situation perhaps not amounting to a manifest necessity.
An incorrect assessment may lead to immunity for a
defendant whose guilt is capable of establishment.
For these reasons, we doubt that the tests offered
by the State in this case, which appears to depend, first, upon
'the sufficiency of the evidence that had been introduced, and
now when the defendant's lawyer may have committed himself in
soma way, or in Professor Schulhofer's recent article, which
is relied on by Appellee Cline, which depends in part upon a
necessarily subjective view of the difficulties encountered
in voir dire, I doubt whether either of those tests would be.
workable

Second, we believe that jeopardy should attach at the
same point in jury and non-jury trials»

As this Court observed

in Jenkins, the double-jeopardy clause nowhere distinguishes
between jury and bench trials,

A defendant’s risk of conviction

is precisely the same in either type of trial. And whether the
fact-finder is the judge or the jury, defendant has the identical
Fifth Amendment interest in completing the trial, hopefully
with an acquittal once it’s begun.
Finally, the point that’s selected for the attachment
of jeopardy must be responsive to the evils of reprosacution
that the double-jeopardy clause is historically designed to
prevent.

That is, the anxieties, the strain, expense suffered

by -the defendant who is forced to undergo repeti'hive trials,
and the possibility of manipulation or harassment by a
prosecutor, particularly the chance of a second opportunity
to convict the defendant, if the first trial is viewed as
proceeding unfavorably.
Now, with those three underlying principles in mind,
the United States believes that the Constitution does not
require jeopardy to attach in any case, State or federal, jury
or non-jury, un-til the fact-finder first begins to receive
evidence.

Only when the government begins to meet its burden

of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant
committed the crime charged can it truly be said that the
defendant faces the risk of conviction.

And it's the risk of

32

conviction that this Court stated in Reed v„ Jones that the
constitutional concept of jeopardy connotes.
The point at which evidence going to the general issue
of guilt or innocence is produced marks a convenient and, we
believe, logical boundary in ©very criminal case, separating
pretrial preliminaries, which, concededly, do not deserve the
protections of the double"jeopardy clause from the trial itself.
The rule that jeopardy attaches when the fact-finder
begins to hear evidence, which is of course the rule that has
i

traditionally been applied in bench trials, fully accommodates
a defendant's Fifth Amendment interest.

Prior to the intro­

duction of evidence, the defendant's interest in avoiding reprosecution ordinarily is very weak, it has not yet suffered
any of the strains or emotional distress associated with being
forced to undergo a criminal trial.

Moreover, a defendant has

little, if any, stake at that pre-evidenhiary stags in pro­
ceeding to a verdict in order to preserve any fact-findings
that the finder of fact may have made in his favor.
QUESTION: What about his interest in the particular
jury that he has chosen, and that is row sworn and is ready
to hear evidence?
MR. GELLERs We don't believe that the interest in
preserving a particular jury for non-evidentiary reasons is an
interest that's protected by the double-jeopardy clause.
QUESTION:

What do you msan non-evidentiary reasons?

33

He wants it because he thinks this is the jury that will do best
with the evidence that he's going to introduce„
MR. GELLER:
highly speculative.

Well, the first objecti.on is that that's
At least when evidence begins to be intro­

duced, we can assess what sort of impact it might have on the
jury.
QUESTION:

It might be speculative, but the defendant

has spent a long time in picking the jury, and he thinks he's
got a good one, and of course before it's sworn, I suppose you
could say if something blew up the trial and there wouldn't ba
any double-jeopardy attachment.

Once it's sworn, the jury

process is completed and is sworn, and here is a jury that the
defendant's counsel is convinced is going to be a very — may
b© a very biased jury; he's convinced it will be biased in his
favor.
You can't say that isn’t a substantial interest,
can you?
MR. GELLER:

Well, I can say i.t's not a substantial

interest protected by the double-jeopardy clause. I can agree
with you,'Mr. Justice White, that it may be a substantial interest
of tdi© defendant that's entitled to protection, perhaps even a
constitutional protection.

And, if, for example, a prosecutor-

sought to abort the trial after the jury had been selected, but
before evidence began, because h© thought that the finder of
*

fact would be unduly favorable to the defendant, there might well

34
be a .remedy for a defendant in that, situation, either under the
jury trial clause of the Sixth Amendment or the due process
clause of the Fifth Amendment.
QUESTION: But does the Constitution guarantee the
man. a favorable jury cr a fair jury?
MR. SELLER:

Obviously it guarantees him a fair jury.

QUESTION: Well, the defendant is convinced that ~
i3 vary convinced that this is an impartial jury, and sometimes
his lawyer knows that there haven't been impartial juries, but
he thinks he's got one new.
MR. SELLER:

And would like to keep it.

I'm not disputing that that may be a

substantial interest of the defendant.

I think the task for this

Court is to determine whether that's an interest protected by
the double-jeopardy clause, instead of, perhaps, the jury trial
clause or the due process clause.
I think tilers is substantial evidence that it's not
an interest, protected by the double-jeopardy clause, for one,
as you alluded to a moment, Justice White, if the prosecutor
had voir dire or when the venire comes .into the courtroom, or
even after the jury has been selected but before it's been
sworn, does something to abort the trial because he thinks that
tlie jury is unduly favorable to the defendant.

There is

absolutely no double-jeopardy analysis of his actions.
Although there may

QUESTION:

MR. GELLER:

I think that the Court should reassess

the entire area, and decide where logically, in light of the
%

history of the double-jeopardy clause, the point of attachment
occurs.

QUESTION:

Only if —

MR. GELLER:

Well, I think

it should be obvious,

I think, to the Court at this point that based upon how the
Court defines the interest protected by the double-jeopardy
clause, it becomes relatively easy to fix the point for the
attachment of jeopardy.
In other words, if the Court finds that th© doublejeopardy clause in fact protects defendant's interest in
favorable jury selection, then jeopardy should obviously attach
at or prior to the selection of the jury.

If you give it that much weight, Mr,

Geller, how do you reconcile that with what Justice Black said
in Wade v„ Hunter, "what has been said is enough to show that a
defendant's valued right to have his trial completed by a
particular tribunal must in some instances be subordinated to
the public interest in fair trials designed to end in just
judgments"?

If it's totally constitutional, Justice Black's

statement is inconsistent, isn't it?
MR, GELLER:

I think that the manifest necessity

notion that Justice Black was articulating in Wade v. Hunter
is also a constitutional notion.

In other words, merely finding

41
that jeopardy is

attached and that the trial has been aborted

does not end the analysis.

In order for the defendant to have

been deprived of his Fifth Amendment rights, there also must
not have been a manifest necessity for the trial termination.
Thank you.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Leaphart.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF W. WILLIAM LEAPHART, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE CLINE
MR. LEAPHART:

Mr.Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The appellants in this case have taken the position
■that the so-called valued right to a particular tribunal is not
of constitutional stature, rather it is a procedural practice
which has developed out of English common law. And the appellant
has concluded that this valued right to a particular tribunal
does not come into play, or does not attach, un-til after the
tribunal has actually heard the defendant’s case.
As the double-jeopardy clausa, the appellent takes
the position in his brief that jeopardy does not attach until
after the State has presented soma evidence from which the
jury could actually convict tee defendant.
The Solicitor, on the other hand, has assumed a more
moderate position and has urged this Court that jeopardy should
attach no later than the swearing of the first witness.
I submit to the Court that this Court’s recent opinion

42

in Arisona vs. Washington contradicts both the position of the
appellant and the Solicitor»
In the Arizona case, the defensa counsel engaged in
some references during his opening statement to inadmissible
evidence.

And, as a consequence of that reference, the trial

court had to declare a mistrial at the request of the prosecu­
tion.
On a federal habeas corpus appeal, this Court sub­
jected the trial court’s actions to a double-jeopardy analysis,
a manifest necessity analysis, and concluded that there was
manifest necessity fox- the declaration of the mistrial.
The import of that case lies in the fact that the
incident arose during the opening statements, and that this
Court decided that case on tee grounds of double-jeopardy,
even though the first witness had not been sworn.
I submit to the Court that implicit in the Arizona
decision is a conclusion that federal double-jeopardy had
attached, at least as early as the opening statement.

And

of course the opening statement is.prior in time to the point
which has been suggested by -the Solicitor, and it is prior in
■time to the point which has been suggested by the appellant.
If, as tee Solicitor has argued, double-jeopardy

interest could not come into play —
QUESTION: The logic of that argument really escapes
me. Supposing, before trial started, the police conducted an

43

illegal search of some kind, and the evidence wasn't introduced
until just before the jury retired for a verdict.

Would you

say, well, that jeopardy hadn't attached because a search
occurred before?
I mean, you don't look at the time of the ~ the time
when jeopardy attaches doesn't depend on whan the error was
committed, does it?
MR. LEAPIIART:

No, Your Honor, what I'm saying, or

what I neant to say is that the mere fact that the Court looked
at the double-jeopardy problem and analysed the case in teams
of manifest necessity meant that double-jeopardy had attached
at least as early as. the time the error occurred.
QUESTION:

Single word, jeopardy.

MR. LEAPIIART:
at least that early.

Excuse me.

QUESTION: Well, I don't understand the logic, because
it actually dismissed the case after two witnesses had

So if jeopardy attaches when a witness testifies,
then jeopardy is attached when he made his ruling.
MR. LEAPIIART:

Well, respectfully, Your honor, I

would submit that the fact that, two witnesses had testified in
that case is really incidental to the decision, because the
QUESTION: But is it incidental to the question whether
jeopardy had attached?

44
MR. LEAPHART:

No, it isn’t.

That's what's being

argued. But in that particular fact situation, the error was
during the opening statement? and that was the sole basis of
the declaration — I think, of the declaration of mistrial.
QUESTION: That's true.
QUESTION: But the judge didn't declare the mistrial
until two witnesses had testified.
MR. LEAPIIART:

That's correct, Your Honor.

But I

think that the fact that he grounded that decision upon the
defense counsel’s improper references during opening statement
indicates that jeopardy had to have attached at least that
s-arly.
If it hadn’t attached, at the time 'the opening
statements were made the trial judge could have dismissed the
case immediately upon the request of «he prosecution -QUESTION: Well, how about the several other cases
where defense counsel did not make an opening statement?

the defense counsel reserves?

Yes,

MR, LEAPHART: And you're asking when would jeopardy
attach in that?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. LEAPHART:

If I may backtrack, I'm not suggesting

that the Arizona case specifically sets the time when jeopardy

45

attaches, as the opening statement.

I'm just saying that, as

a minimum, it said it had to attach at least as early as the
opening statement, if I —
QUESTION: But supposing this prejudicial argument had
been made during the voir dire?

Which could have happened,

he could have made some prejudicial remark.

Would you say

jeopardy therefore had to attach during voir dire?
MR. LEAPHART:

No, Your Honor, I -think that the

triggering factor is going to be the point in time at which the
particular tribunal comes into existence.

We're talking about

valued right to a particular tribunal.
And I'm not going to argue to -this Court that jeopardy
can attach, that the valued right has any meaning, prior to the
tine that that particular tribunal is even in existence.
>

I think that that's the event which triggers the

valued right.
QUESTION: But what is it in Arizona vs_. Washington
that makes you say this comes into existence at the point that
the jury is sworn?
MR. LEAPHART:

I don't think the case goes that far,

Your Honor.
QUESTION: Well, I don't, either.
MR. LEAPHART:

I think it only goes as far as saying

that it has attached at least at the time of th© opening state­
ment.

It doesn't say how far in advance of that time.

46

Wall, I don’t think, than, you’ve satisfied me as to
my brother Stevens’ earlier question., that, supposing in midtrial, after several witnesses are sworn, -the trial judge
grants a motion to suppress evidence as a result of illegal
conduct that took place four or five weeks before the trial?
Nov;, surely, you’re not going to say that the jeopardy
attached at the time that search-and-seizure took place, are
you?
MR. LEAPHART:

No, Your Honor, I'm not.

I don't

think that's consistent with -«die valued-right concept.
Obviously, the jury, the particular tribunal was not in
existence at the time the motion to suppress was made.

But

what I’m saying is what I think Arizona stands for is that if
jeopardy had not attached prior to swearing the first witness,
I don’t tdiink the trial judge would have even had to concern
himself with the defendant’s valued right to proceed.

He

could have declared th© mistrial without any concern at all
for manifest necessity.
QUESTION: But he granted it when two witnesses had
been sworn, and testified.
MR. LEAPHART: Well, I think that he was merely ‘taking
th® prosecution's motion under advisement while he had a chance
to look up th© lav; on the matter.

And I don’t think that the

prosecution —
QUESTION: But, in th© meanwhile, jeopardy had attached?

47
MR. LEAPHART:

Well, —

QUESTION: At least —
MR. LEAPHART:

I believe, Your Honor, in the State of

Arizona, it had attached at the beginning of the opening
statement.

But I don't think that the Arizona law controls when

federal double~jeepardy attaches.

Arizona falls right in

between the two points that are being argued in this case.
But I don't think that's a controlling factor in that
case, in the Arizona vs. Washington case.
QUESTION:

But I think all you're saying is that

the trial judge, who had to make the ruling, was considering
the fact that jeopardy had attached at the time of the opening
statement, but that was — it was either as a matter of
Arizona law or perhaps it's his understanding of the Constitu­
tion.
But that really doesn't control.
MR. LEAPHART: Well, it may have been . his understand­
ing of the Arizona law, Your Honor, but for purposes of the
Arizona decision in this Court, 'that was a question of federal
law. Because this Court in Jorn and in Serfass has stated
that the attaching of jeopardy rule indicates the point in time
when constitutional policies are brought into play.

And I

don't think we can have the State of Arizona or the State of
Montana or any other State telling the United States Supreme
Court when constitutional policies are brought into play.

48

That's why I say I think it's implicit in that, decision
by the more fact that the court en.ge.ged in a double-jeopardy
analysis there is implicit a conclusion that federal jeopardy
had attached,.
There ara, I think, two other points which have been
raised

by my adversaries, which are answered in the Arizona

opinion. First of all/ the appellant has taken the position
that the valued right to a particular tribunal is not part of
til© double-jeopardy clause * that it’s a common lav/ rule of
procedure»

And I would bring the Court's attention to Justice

Stevens' unequivocal statement in the Ari.zona opinion, where
he points out that the double-jeopardy clause embraces the
defendant's valued right to have

his trial completed by a

particular tribunal»
I think, in light of that, there's no question but ■—
QUESTIONS

And that — well, that goes back to Jorn,

which in turn goes back to Hunter, doesn’t it?
MRoLEAPHART:

That’s correct, Your Honor»

I think

that -that —
QUESTION:
necessarily»

And it doesn't mean that, it's sound,

I mean., it doesn't mean that the two concepts

don't have different historic origins»
MR» LEAPHART:
think they do.
QUESTION: Right

In fact, I would agree with that, I

49
MR. LEAPI IART:

But -that it has bean engrafted onto

idle double-jeopardy clause.
QUESTION: Right.
QUESTION:

You say Reed v. Hunter was a jury case

or -MR.LEAPIIART:

Reed v. Hunter was a court martial case.

And I think that there can be certain analogies drawn between
that and a jury trial, because the defendant in a court
martial does have some say in the picking of the fact-finder.
At least, as I understand it, he can exerci.se his challenges
for cause, and I think he can also exercise one preemptory
challenge.
QUESTION:

He didn't in World War II.

QUESTION:

No one has ever done it.

[Laughter.3
MR. LEAPIIART:

I don't know, Your Honor.

QUESTION: Because it's not healthy.
[Laughter.3
QUESTION: But there's no real analogy between the
composition of a court martial and the composition of a jury
at a trial?
MR. LEAPIIART:

Just to the very limited extent that

idle defendant does have some say-so in picking the fact-finder.
QUESTION: Theoretically?
MR. LEAPIIART:

Yes

50
The Soli.citor seems to argue, at least in his brief,
•that the double-jeopardy clause, the sole purpose of the double­
jeopardy clause is to protect the defendant from multiple
exposures to the risk of conviction.

And certainly the double­

jeopardy clause does protect that interest.
But I think that this Court, in a number of opinions,
up to and including the Arizona opinion, has taken great pains
to point out that the clause also protects the defendant's
valued right.

And when the Court says the valued right to

proceed before that particular tribunal, that includes at
least three other interests.

It protects the defendant from

the danger of having to engage in a prolonged period of
financial and emotional burdenp it protects the defendant from
a prolonged period of stigma, which results as a consequence of
pending criminal charges? and finally and very importantly, it
prevents the State from using the jury as a prosecutorial tool.
That is, replacing one jury with another jury, when it appears
that the State will be unable to convict.
On three separata places within the Arizona opinion,
tiie Court states that every and any mistrial declaration
inevitably affects -the defendant's constitutional right under
the valued-right concept.

And I emphasize the words "any and

every mistrial declaration" because I -think that the use of
those words points out that the interests which are being
projected do not hinge upon, in any way, the swearing of the

51

first witi-j.esSo
We are talking about interests which come into play
as soon as that particular tribunal has been empaneled.

The

fact that a witness is sworn in really has no consequence in
terms of the interests which come under the valued right.
QUESTION:

How in the world can a man be convicted

if no evidence is put in?
MR. LEAPHART: Well, he can't, Your Honor.
QUESTION: Well, then, how is he in jeopardy?
MR. LEAPHART: Well, I'm saying that this Court has
interpreted that —
QUESTION: Even though we discussed that the last tin©,
but nobody has raised that point this time.
MR. LEAPHART: Well, in terms of actually being
convicted, he's not in jeopardy, but I think this Court has
interpreted the double-jeopardy clause an including a valued
right to proceed before the jury is first empaneled.

And I

think that that interest attaches immediately upon the empaneling
of the jury.

Vi'he re we're talking about something broader

than just the mere risk of conviction.
QUESTION:

Well, we're talking about the possibility

of two or three minutes, too, aren't we?
MR. LEAPHART: Well, I think that depends on
particular case we're talking about.

the

It's conceivable that

the jury could be empaneled on a Friday afternoon, you'd have

a weekend recess, opening statements may take a long time, the
defense counsel as well as the prosecution may make motions»
QUESTION: And it also could be a case that was tried
early on Monday morning»
MR, LEAPHART:

That’s correct»

And it may be a

matter of seconds»
QUESTION: And both sides waive opening statement»
MR» LEAPH/iRT:

That's correct»

QUESTION: So that wouldn't be much good, would it?
MR» LEAPHART:

I — what wouldn't be much good, Your

Honor?
QUESTION: The one minute»
MR» LEAPHART:

Well, conceivably the prosecutor can

still stand up and move to dismiss the jury, even though he's
only got one minute to do it»

I think his motives are going

to be pretty transparent, but he cam do it*
QUESTION:

I'm talking about in the average trial*

The difference, you say it has to be one witness sworn*
MR* LEAPHART: Well, no, I5m arguing against that
position, Your Honor*
QUESTION:

I'm just saying that I don't think that
Oh ~

MR* LEAPHART:

I don't think tee fact that a witness

has been sworn —
QUESTION:

I mean that's the government’s position*

MR* LEAPHART:

That's correct

53
QUESTION: That’s right, it’s ona witness sworn.
MR. LEAPIIART: Right.
QUESTION: And you say no, once the jury is empaneled.
MR. LEAPIIART:

Correct.

QUESTION: And that could be just a few minutes.
MR. LEAPIIART:

Between those two points?

QUESTION: Right.
MR. LEAPIIART:
QUESTION:

Yes „

It could be.

MR. LEAPIIART: Could be.
QUESTION:

Mr. Leaphart, I'm still a little puzzled.

Let me ask what I asked the last tiroe:

What are you here?

Isn’t Cline out of this case now entirely, and isn’t the case
moot as to him?
MR. LEAPIIART:
jail.

Your Honor, Mr. Cline is out, out of

I have not. briefed the question of mootness.

As I

answered last time I think that Mr. Cline's interest in this
case lies in the fact that should this Court reverse the Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals, there is the very clear possibility
that the State, if it wants to, then can reprosecute him on
some of the other seven counts which were involved in this case.
He has a very definite interest in seeing that the
decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed.
He is -the appellee in this case.

I am here merely representing

him. The State is the one that has chosen to appeal, ©nd from

54
that I gather they still have an interest in prosecuting Mr.
Cline.
And this Court — I can't cits the cases to you right
now, I've got them in my briefcase if you would like, but the
case — the Court has held on two different occasions, I think,
that the remedies available under the habeas corpus statute
are. broader in scope than merely releasing a man from prison?
that it can rectify the situation at hand.
QUESTION: Well, we're familiar with -those cases, but
I just wondered what substance is left in your case.
MR. LEAPHART:

My time is up.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BJJRGER:

Thank you.

Mr. Moses.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES F. MOSES, ESQ.,
ON BEIIALF OF APPELLEE BRETZ
MR. MOSES ;

Mr. Chief. Justice, and may it please the

Court;
May I suggest to the Court a different area for
discussion?

Justice Stewart brought up the issue of the origin

of the valued right.

I think that -the Fourteenth Amendment to

idle Constitution is one of the important issues in this case.
I think the question that is raised here, where it says that

no Stata shall make or enforce any lav; which shall abridge the
privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States,
that the history of that amendment in 1866, while through the
Adamson case of Justi.ce Black, which started the incorporation

55

theory, in a relevant issue hare»
Should tiie Court adopt a position under the Fourteenth
Amendment that the State should follow case-by-case# jot-by-jot
under the incorporation theory.
QUESTION:

Justice Black wrote a dissenting opinion

in the Adamson case.
MR. MOSES:

Yes# he wrote a dissenting opinion# and

what he did in the dissenting opinion# Mr. Justice Relinquish#
was to set forth all of the congressional proceedings where
Bingham# the Congressman in 1866# said# "I sponsored, or I
wrote this Fourteenth Amendment because of the case of Bern vs,
Baltimore*3 # which said si.mply that the first eight
Amendments applied only to the federal government.
So that the construction of the Fourteenth Amendment#
I think, has a measure of important here.
The reason that I say that# because if it is in origin
a privilege or immunity that is not rare or abstract# but is
something that is recognised by the courts# then that is
something that should be enforced under the Fourteenth Amend­
ment.
I raise that issue because I think that then the
federal and the State would have the same privileges and
immunities# it would be consistent with the supremacy clause#
as we understand it# the law of the land# the bench and the bar
would know exactly what the rule was.

And I think that that's

56
important;»
The reason that; I mention that is because of the
second issue under the Fourteenth Amendment, and that’s not
the privileges and immuniti.es but is the due process section.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. NOSE:

And it seems to me, as I read the cases,

that we will apply to the States through the Fourteenth Amend"
ment those, constitutional rights the Court deems fundamental,
and thus apply federal statutes.
It’s a selective, incorporation, as I see it.

It

seems to me that Renton vs. Maryland, which is an important case
on the issue of jeopardy, raises that issue of selective
incorporation.
In other words, what we’re saying

is that under the

due process of the Fourteenth Amendment, is that double-jeopardy
is a fundamental right.

We can agree upon that.

But that’s

notthe end of the inquiry.
Is the time it attaches simply non-constitutional
baggage?

If we' re going to be se lecti, vs in our incorporation

of the first eight

Amendments.

And of course that raises the question of whether
it is implicit in the right given.
"parsing" or pick apart.
empaneled and sworn.

I like to use the word

Jeopardy attaches when the jury is

If you just say "jeopardy attaches" end

leave out "when the jury is empaneled and sworn", then I think

57
the language i.s meaningless, it, doesn't make sense.
You're going to have to say that jeopardy attaches
either when the jury is empaneled and sworn., to make it complete,
or when the State says it does, or whan the first witness.
So that I think it is implicit even under the
selective incorporation rule.
There's been a lot of opposition to this incorporation
doctrine.

Justice Stewart has written upon it.

One of the

things I think has to be decided is whether we're going to
reject the incorporation theory entirely under the Fourteenth
Amendment. And I think that's relevant to this particular
decision.
The first eight Amendments are only applicable to
federal proceedings, period.

Any schoolboy knows that.

States —- you may adopt a rul© that States may adopt
any standard they wish, subject only to the strictures of their
own State law or Constitution end the fundamental fairness test.
You may want to adopt that.
Now, if tiiat*s done, it seems to me that we have a
chancellor's foot standard, and we're going back to Palko and
?
Twining.
I think those are the issues, in my judgment in this
case, is the application of the due process clause, whether
we're going to have complete incorporation, selective incorpora­
tion or rejection of the incorporation doctrine.
One of 'the difficulties, if I may add this to my

58

argument very briefly is that there is great uncertainty in
the lav;.

Lawyers don’t know how to advise their clients.

Lawyers don't know how to argue before the courts, because
they simply do not know what the lav; is.

That's why I think

there should be some certainty in the lav;.
We had in Montana, for instance — taka Winship on
Reasonable Doubt, its requirement.
that rule.

In Montana we don't have

We have a different rule:

a high probability of

its existence, as to one of the essential elements.
Which rule do you follow?

said: We do not accept Drady.

The Court has simply

We don't accept it.

It took two months to try, almost, and the case was
finally reversed on the basis -that the Supreme Court finally
straightened out " the district court on Brady vs. Maryland,

QUESTION; What do you mean by that?

MR. MOSES:
Fourth Amendment.

Well, eliminat» the provisions of the
I want to be very dogmatic shout that, I'm

not talking about eliminating the remedy of the exclusionary
rule —QUESTION:
MR. MOSES:

You said eliminate search-and-seizure.
I'm saying eliminate search-and-seizure.

Now, that's ny opinion, my judgment.
QUESTION:

So there would be no searches snd no

seizures in Montana?
MR. MOSES:

There will be no penalty as far as due

process is concerned with respect, to how the evidence was
obtained, in the courts in Montana.
QUESTION:

No exclusionary rule, is that what you

mean?
MR. MOSES:

No exclusionary ru3.e.

It. may be a good idea, but the rule is, the question
is that we go from the very basics, discovery, reasonable doubt,
presumption of innocence, burden of proof, search-arid-seizure,
the rule in the State of Montana is entirely different. And
we don't know, as practicing attorneys, what rule do we follow?
Do we follow the federal rule, because it is a matter of
constitutional importance under the supremacy clause?

Or do

we follow the State statute?
It is a difficult problem from my point of view.

GO
Now, finally, to end ray statement, because I wan'ted
to address the Court's attention simply to the Fourteenth
Amendment, let ms end by saying that I disagree with my friend,
Mr. Keller.

In the last two years I have decided that I make

all opening statements at the beginning of the case.

I just

had a murder case with the battered-woman syndrom^ and I
wanted the jury to hear about the battered-woman syndrome at
•the ear list possible time, before the shooting in the back
testimony came to the fore.

I had a good reason for it.

But I am now almost exclusively making opening
s tatements.
Secondly, it is true in the practice in Montana that
the judge is now permitted to give instructions to aid and
assist the jury in the fair consideration of the case as they
sit there. And that is a good idea.

And that occurs before the

first witness is sworn.
My conclusion to the Court is this;
think, is of constitutional significance.

The rule, I

As a matter of fact,

what I'd like to do, if I may, —■ let me read you an opinion
and order that I think would be appropriate in this case.
"The double-jeopardy clause of the United States
Constitution is a fundamental constitutional right.

Jeopardy,

as we have said, attaches when the jury i.s empaneled and sworn.
Anything in the Constitution or lav/s of any State to the
contrary notwithshanding, the decision is affirmed."

61
That's what I would propose.
Thank you, gentlemen..
*

QUESTION:

Let me ask you just one question..

When

you spoke of a judge giving instructions, you're speaking of
preliminary limited instructions about the burden of proof and
the order of trial, not a complete instruction on the lav/ of
the particular case?
MR. MOSES:
Justice.

In essence, that is correct, Mr. Chief

What the judge does now under the current practice

is simply give the jury those necessary instructions that it
feels is appropriate to guide the jury under the *— as it site
there. For instance, the presumption of innocence rule, and
that "you may not form or express any opinion as to the merits
of the case, that you are the sole judges of the credibility
of the witnesses", things of that kind. So .they really know
what they are supposed to do,
But that occurs after the jury is empaneled and
sworn and oorox'o the first witness takes tile stand.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
QUESTION:
MR. MOSES:
QUESTION:

Very wall,

May I ask this question?
Yes, sir.
My recollection is the information in this

case was dismissed solely because of a typographical error in
date

62

MR. MOSES;

No, sir.

QUESTION: What was it dismissed for?
MR. MOSES:

That was only one — that was only one

of the grounds for dismissal, Mr. Justice Powell.
QUESTION: That was the ground for dismissal of one
of the counts.
MR. MOSES:

Of one of the counts, yes, sir.

QUESTION: Right.
MR. MOSES: There were five other counts that were
good.
QUESTION: Right.

Well, Judge Tuttle characterized

that, as I recall, as a tactical stroke.

Were you counsel at

the time?
MR. MOSES:

I was counsel at the time, and it was

not a tactical stroke, sir.
QUESTION:

May I ask what prompted you to wait until

after the jury was sworn?
MR. MOSES:
happened.

You have ~ let m© tall you exactly what

I had raised the issue as to the -- whether the

offenses or any of them stated a criminal offense, as to all
of -the counts.

I had raised substantial objections, and they

were overruled without the court ever reading the brief.

And

once the jury was empaneled and sworn, I raised that same issue
again, the same issue. And I still contend that there were not
sufficient grounds to stats a public offensa as to all of the

63

counts»
At that particular time I think they moved to amend,
to have a particular date? and of course X objected.
But my objection --- and I also requested at that time
that we go to the Supreme Court and have this all resolved,
but the Supreme Court, when the application was made by the
Attorney General to go to the Supreme Court after they refused
to allow the amendment and some other changes, the Supreme Court
refused and said:

Go back and try it,*

Than they came into court and said, "We're going to
dismiss them all, all of them".

I think there were five other

good counts at least, they were going to dismiss them all and
start in again. And the record is plain that I objected in
writing -- I'm sorry, I didn't object in writing. The record
is clear that I objected at that time.
So it was not, to that extent, a tactical maneuver
on my part, Hr. Justice Powell.

I was there because the

charges were not any good in my judgment.

I wanted to go to the

Supreme Court to prove that. The Supreme Court wouldn’t hear it.
And during that course of time, they moved to amend and, of
course, I objected then to them doing anything.
That's 'the way it occurred.
QUESTION:
Powell's question:

Mr. Moses, just to follow up on Justice
In your judgment, if the case had gone to

trial on the original counts, and there had been a verdict of

64

guilty, would there have been reversible error in the record
on that basis?
MR. MOSES:

In my judgment, yes.

QUESTION: And then what would have happened?

Then,

if that had happened, then there would have been a reversal
and a new trial, wouldn't there?
MR. MOSES:
QUESTION:

You bet.

That’s exactly correct.

So your client would have had 'to stand

trial twice, if your position is —
MR. MOSES;

That is precisely correct.

QUESTION: Well, then, how is your client, in

terms

of double-jeopardy policy and valued right and all the rest of
it that we’ve been talking about, how was your client hurt at
all by having the dismissal take place right at the outset
of the proceedings, instead of going through a whole trial and
appeal and ending up in the same place?
MR. MOSES:
sir.

I have a personal prejudice about that,

In my opinion, being the trial counsel, the reason over­

all that it was dismissed, they had five other good charges,
the reason it was dismissed is that the prosecution thought
‘they had a lousy jury,

i thought we killed them on voir dir©

as to what the issues were, and then we had a good jury.
This is at the Capital, where you have State employees and
things of that kind, and in selecting the jury I thought
had a good jury.

MR. MOSES:

I moved to dismiss because of

the fact that they didn’t state a public offense.
QUESTION: Right.
QUESTION; And you objected also when counsel for the
State wished to correct his error.
MR. MOSES:

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. KELLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. KELLER:

Wa.de v. Hunter, Justice Murphy with

Justi.ce Douglas and Justice Rutledge agreeing in dissent,
said in the first paragraph:

"W@ agree with the court below

that in the military courts, as in civil, jeopardy within the
meaning of the Fifth Amendment attaches when the court begins
the hearing of evidence.”
I don’t think there's any question in that court
martial that you weren't talking about a jury or picking a jury.
That was prior to 1951.

And you just know they didn't have

j uries.
QUESTION:
MR. KELLER;

Right.
That’s correct.

The only other points are just in passing, any
opening statement that my colleague, Mr. Moses, makes to a jury

doss n't: toll the prosecuti©?!, anything, period.
doesn’t.

I know that it

And he might have a bathered-wom&n syndrome, he

might have anything else, but he doesn't tell the prosecution
anything.

Not without appeal, frankly, so no problem there.
QUESTION:

Mr. Keller, may I ask you a question,

please?
Just on the point that Justi.ce Powell and I were in­
quiring of your adversary, what is the State's positi.on on
whether or not there was manifest necessity?

Just so we have

it clear on the record.
MR. KELLER:
QUESTION:

At -that particular time?
Yes.

MR. KELLER:

I didn't think that there was a manifest

necessity issue, ---•
QUESTION:

You're not contending that there was?

MR. KELLER:

— I caii recall Justice Rehnquist

asking me, maybe you might and would disagree, and that's well
taken. But at that particular time, and we didn't participate
in the trial of this —
QUESTION: Right.
MR. KELLER:

— at that particular time they had

three counts that were defective just because of a typographical
error.

What Mr. Moses is talking about is he thought all nine

were defective, aside from the typographical error, just as a
matter of lew

68

QUESTION:

That they didn't charge criminal offenses
*

under Montana law.
MR. KELLER:

That's right.

But as to these three

counts tliat had to get thrown out, 'they charged an offense
that wasn't an offense any longer.
QUESTION: Right.
MR. KELLER:

The law had changed in Montana, Criminal

Code of '73 took effect on January 1, '74, and these three
counts said the crimes in 1973 language occurred in January
and February of '74.
Well, they could go to trial, they could go anywhere
and they could never convict on that.
QUESTION: So you say as to those three —
MR. KELLER:

They did make a good point, and Judge

Bennett will never make the mistake again.

He'll grant the

amendment, have the trial, get reversed, and we'll try it again.
We won't talk double-jeopardy.

And we know —

QUESTION: So, is it clear then — I just want to ba
sure I understand.

Is it clear, then, in the State's view that

the trial judge had power to amend the counts, and there was
no necessity for dismissal? is that what you're saying?
MR. KELLER:
power.

I don't think that he did have that

I think that change was substantive and our statute at

that time prevented a substantive change.
QUESTION;

Unh-hunh

MR. KELLER:

You wera going to charge: the defendant

with picking up an extra year of time to defend, on its face, —
QUESTION: Well, —
MR. KELLER:

— not really; but you were* on its face,

it was there,
QUESTION:

Let me ask the same question again.

In your view, was there or was there not manifest necessity for
dismissal of the charges?
MR, KELLER:
QUESTION:
MR, KELLER:

To dismiss those charges?
Yes.
I think there was, on those three, but

not on the remaining six.
QUESTION:
MR, KELLER:

I see.

So the remaining •—

That's where the hangup came, and h©

got convicted ultimately of one of the three that was corrected.
He got charged at the second trial with one of the six that
wasn't affected, and one of the three that was corrected, and
found guilty of on© of the three that was corrected.
QUES TION:
MR, KELLER:

Unh-hunh.
Tli© prosecution at that tins didn't

want to go ahead on those six, because they weren't that good.
But they would have sure come under Ash v. Swenson, it would
have bean collateral estoppel, used as a wedge, because it
all to3k tills same period of time, they all had to do with on®
woman and on© transaction, literally.

They were spread-eagle

70
at: the time, whether they knew it or not.
And it may not have been a tactical tool, but it
sure was an awfully smart nova.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. KELLER:

Thank you, Mr. Keller,

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

Th© case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:31 o’clock, a.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.3
