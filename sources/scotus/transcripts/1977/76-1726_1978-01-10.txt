Did this Court- by Mo rags.®, reduce the Death ca the
l

High Seas; Act to the scrap heap, or reduce it. to the level of a
aos}.stat.ut.ory restatement, as Professors Gilmore and Black have
said ©x suggested or questioned?
Our submission is that clearly Justice Herlan, in the
opinio» in Moragne, did not intend to do so.

We submit that

it’s clear beyond any possibility of doubt that this Court, in
Moragns, did not decide more than it had to.

And when Justice

Harlan wrote, wWa conclude that the Death on the High Sees
Act. was not intended to preclude the availability of a remedy
for wrongful death under general maritime law in situations
not covered by the Act.”, he specifically declined, or this
Court specifically declined to, by Moragne, appeal or nullify
or circumvent DOHSA.

of the Fif*sh Circuit in Law vs. _S©aJDrilii.rg;.
Tie question arises because the Fifth Circuit in the

Higgiafcothan aft al., decided that it was precluded from
deciding for itself whether or not Moragna nullified

There is

QJlSSTIONs

Well, "by any navigable waters3 he was

lid. SCHUMACHERs

He was including, Your Honor, the

thra-A-mile limit, which clearly there was good authority for
him to do so,

But th© facts in Law involve deaths beyond

1he thrc©**mile limit, as did the facts in Barbe ys. Drurgyond,,
The First Circuit, address,ing itself to the identical
question,

Now, both the petitioner «ad the respondent, in the

Act.
I submit to the Court that the statute itself
strata

.‘ led that th© Death on the

High Seas Act be 'the exclusive remedy for death actions
occurring ....

sr whs re death occurs- more than three miles out,

6
out- of die territorial waters of tb© State*

reads, "When-

avsr tls d-s&th of © person shall be caused by wrongful act,
neglect., or default; occurring on tfrs high seas beyond a marine
league from sfcjr© .„. the personal represemative of the
decedent may maintain & suit for damages.., *
But the damages provision, which is the provision
which bears on directly on the Higginbotham case, provides,
"The recovery in such suit shall be a fair and just compensa­
tion for t’l3 pecuniary loss sustained. 0."
And whether our reading of the Congressional Record

may be deb a. tab la ? but the language, of the statute certainly
cannot

And the. statute says that the measura of

damages shall b© the pecuniary loss.
‘Ubere is no exception to that command.
I

suppose, Your Honors, that the petitioner's
reduces itself to this:

We feel that in

Moragn© the Court correctly limited itself to consideration of
death occurring 'within th® three-mile limit. Vie feel that it.

As I understand it, that's not what the admiralty and maritime
law means mmn It apeals of -uniformity.

It means uniformity

10
in the mutters of liability leading to the decision, as set out
by th© Fifth Circuit in

quoted at page 20 of our brief;

"The * uniformity' that, is fundamental in maritime law has tc do
with the bases of liability, not with differing elements of
damages that may be recoverable in differing circumstances with
differing class of beneficiaries•"
And. that comes from the Dennis case.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACK C. BENJAMIN, ESQ.L
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. BENJAMIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and rosy it please

th© Court;
I want to point; out to th© Court in the very beginning
that my client, Mrs. Shinn, one of th® respondents, was — her
decadent was entitled to th© benefits of the Jones Act, the
Ec „th on thp. High Seas Act. and the general maritime law, as
found by the district court, and affirmed by the Fifth Circuit,
■as dis'i:j.i.iguish,ad from Mrs. 'Higginbotham, whose decedent "'as

the Death ca the High - Seas Act** may not dispose of the Shinn
matter# but- may dispose of the Higginbotham matter.
Now, 1 think it was the intention of the petitioner
to ask the Court to consider both the Death on the High Seas
Act and the Jonas Act in relation to the Moragne cause of action
for wrongful death, and we have so treated that in our brief.

this language resulted after
groat d-^bat • on the Floor of the Ecus®, where there was: some

15

language* in this amendment which restricted the State statutes
to ■territorial limits, and that language was excluded.
So we believe this Act was passed by Congress, it
was really to confer jurisdiction in federal court, which had
not existed before, before 1920,

It was not a grant of

exclusive jurisdiction, because those statutes which had been
passed by the Stats, which could have applied to the high seas,
were still permitted to by the v-ary language in the statute
that X just read to the Court.
Nsw, if Your Honors Inquired of me which States had
such statutes, I'm afraid I could not answer the question;
obviously there must have been sort® which did, because tears
wouldn't have bean the necessity for the discussion in tie
Hous<? wh-ra she legislation was debated.
