PROCEEDINGS

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments first

this morning In 76-1121* American Broadcasting Companies against
Writers Guild and the cases consolidated with that case.
Mr. Come,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORTON J. COME* 'E3Q,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER NLRB
MR, COME:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please the

Court:
This case presents another facet of the problem which
this Court considered in Florida Power four years ago.

The

question is whether Section 8(b)(1)(B) of the National Labor
Relations Act which makes it an unfair labor practice for a
union to restrain or coerce an employer in the selection of
his representatives for collective bargaining or grievance
adjustment* whether a union violates this provision by threaten­
ing to discipline and disciplining supervisors who are also
members of the union for crossing a picket line to perform
their normal supervisory duties during the strike.
Now* the facts* very briefly* are these.

Respondent*

the Writers Guild* represents for collective bargaining purposes
writers who prepare scripts for motion pictures and television
films.

The Employers also employ producers* directors and

story editors to manage and carry out the production of the
films.

The producers, directors and story editors are

5
supervisors within the meaning of the Act and when engaged as
such they also represent the Employers in the adjustment of
grievances and the producers also represent them in seme cases
for collective bargaining purposes.
Sene producers, directors and story editors, known as
hyphenates -*» and these are the people that we will be concerned
with here -- have writing capabilities and are at times employed
by the Employers as writers.

The Guild represents the hyphen"

ates only when they are employed as writers and not when they
are employed as producers, directors or story editors.

Most

hyphenates have personal service contracts with the Employers
when they are so engaged.
The collective bargaining agreement with the Guild
provides that a person subject — employed in a nonwriting
capacity, such as a producer, writer or director, is not
covered by the Agreement.

The Agreement further provides that

producers, directors and story editors may engage in certain
editorial writing functions, called A to H functions, without
becoming subject to the Agreement*
Now. in March of '73, the Guild began a strike
against tne-SmpXoyers in furtherance of their demands for new
contracts covering the writers.

The strike continued against

some employers until July of that year.

A month before the

strike started the Guild distributed strike rules to all members,
including the hyphenates.

In addition to prohibiting writing

6
for struck employers ,fche rules prohibited all members, regardless
of the capacity in which they were working, from crossing the
union picket lines.

The union strike rules also prohibited

union members from working in the future with members who
violated the strike rules.

And the Guild, through a special

meeting of the hyphenates and the phone calls to particular
hyphenates, emphasized that the strike rules would apply to
the hyphenates working in any capacity and that they would be
subject to discipline and blacklisting if they crossed the
picket lines.
The Employers, on the other hand, demanded that the
hyphenates continue, notwithstanding the strike and the picket
lines, to perform their duties, other than as writers, under
their personal service contracts.

Some hyphenates crossed the

picket lines to perform their normal supervisory and managerial
functions as producers, directors and story editors.

They per­

formed no writing work which would otherwise have been performed
by the striking writers0

Many hyphenates did not go to work.

During and after the strike, the Guild filed internal
charges against 31 of the hyphenates for crossing the picket
line, and 10 of them were subsequently convicted and were sus­
pended or expelled from union membership and fines ranging from

$500 to $50,000 were assessed.

Later the union membership voted

to reduce the penalties of nine of the convicted hyphenates.
Upon charges filed by the Employers, the Board, with

7
Member Panning dissenting., concluded that the Guild had violated
Section 8(b)(1)(B) of the Act by disciplining and threatening
to discipline the hyphenates for crossing the picket line to
perform their normal supervisory duties.
Now* Florida Power holds that a union's discipline of
one of its members who is a supervisory employee can constitute
a violation of Section 8(b)(1)(B) only when that discipline may
adversely affect the supervisor's conduct in performing the
duties of and acting in his capacity as grievance adjuster or
collective bargainer on behalf of the employer.

The discipline

in Florida Power was found not to have this effect» because the
supervisors viere disciplined for crossing the picket line to
engage in rank and file struck work, which is neither collective
bargaining or grievance adjustment» nor any activities related
thereto.
VJe submit that a different conclusion is called for
where., as here» the supervisor crosses ..the.'picket line to perform
his normal supervisory duties and they include» as was true in
this case» grievance adjustment and collective bargaining
functions„
Now» there are two bases on which we believe we can
satisfy the Florida Power .test.

The first is referred to as

a deprivation theory and the other is a carry over theory.
Turning to the deprivation theory first, we believe that the
threat of discipline restrained the employers in the selection

•

8
of a representative for grievance adjustment and collective
bargaining no less than if the union had engaged in a direct
strike to obtain the removal of a disfavored foreman would have
done.

For two reasons.

Insofar as the threat kept hyphenates

away from work -- and it appears that about 100 of them did not
go to work

the employers were deprived of their services

which included grievance adjustment and collective bargaining.
Insofar as the hyphenates defied the union and went to work -=
and at least 31 did because that was the number disciplined —
the employers will nonetheless have been coerced by the union's
threat because the legality of a threat is not dependent upon
its effectiveness, and the strike rules here were in effect for­
at least a month before the strike started and before the em­
ployer was able to ascertain who would or would not come to
work,
Nov/, in the first argument of this case, the union
conceded that if it had threatened to.discipline the hyphenates
for crossing the picket lines to perform grievance adjustment
or collective bargaining functions, it would have violated
Section 8(b)(1)(B), irrespective of whether the threat was
effective.

It contends, however, that the Board hasn’t proved

that the union's threats deprived the employers of their repre­
sentatives for grievance adjustment or collective bargaining
purposes because there is no finding, first, that the hyphenates
stayed away because of the threats rather than the picket line,

9
and, two, there is no finding that the union intended to fine
the hyphenates for performing grievance adjustment and collec­
tive bargaining functions , as distinguished from performing
their other supervisory duties.
We submit that these contentions don't stand up for
these reasons.

In the first place.» since the union threatened

the hyphenates with discipline if they went to work in any
capacity, we submit that the burden Is on them, under familiar
principles of law, to disentangle the consequences for which
they are chargeable from those from which they are immune.

You

do not have just a picket line in a strike and supervisors
electing not to honor the picket line.
Secondly, as I pointed out, the union threatened the
hyphenates with discipline If they went to work in any capacity.
They knew that the employers had asked the hyphenates to perform their normal supervisory duties, that these ...eluded •
grievance adjustment and collective bargaining and that with
the other employees remaining at work as they did, it was likely
that they would be called upon to engage in grievance adjustment
and collective bargaining.
fact, Were.

And the record shows that they, in

In these circumstances, we submit —

QUESTION:

How does the record show that they were

engaged in collective bargaining?

Maybe I had a limited view

of the definition of collective bargaining, but it seems to me
that that has to do with negotiating a collective agreement.

10
MR„ CCME:

Well* the record shows that the producers

when they were on location were frequently called upon to enter
Into on-the-spot agreements to cover people that had to be hired
to perforin services.

The producers are the only ones* on

occasion* who were required to engage in collective bargaining.
The others adjusted grievances* and the record does show that
they did adjust grievances because they were shooting film.
There was no new writing going on* but there were prepared
scripts before the strike and they were being filmed.
actors at work.

You had

You had the other people* other ‘than writers*

and there were —
QUESTION:

You include grievance adjustment as part

of collective bargaining?

In addition to collective bargaining.

It ’s really not part of it* is it?

Under the statute* it says

for the purpose of collective bargaining or the adjustment of
grievances.
MR. COME:

The statute does distinguish the two.

I

think that you could make a good argument that the concept of
collective bargaining* as it is understood in labor-management
relations* could in a broad sense include the d&y to day admin­
istration of the agreement and insofar as the adjustment of
grievances under the contract is part of the day to day admin­
istration of the contract as part of the process of collective
bargaining.
QUESTION:

Mr. Come* if an employer refuses to

11

process grievances under the collective bargaining agreement,
can that be the basis of an 8(b)(5) charge?
MR, COME:

An 8(a)(5) charge, yes.

QUESTION:

It is collective bargaining, isn't it?

MR, COME;

It is.

Justice Stewart is correct, however

that Congress distinguished it.

In this statute, I submit, it

wasn't necessary to separate the two out.

Collective bargaining

would have covered the whole thing.
QUESTION:

In other words, if that second phrase had

been omitted, it would be no different at all?

That’s your

position?
MR. C04E:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

Was there a collective bargaining agreement

in existence?

And if so, what was the strike about?

MR. COME:

There were agreements covering these other

people who were working during the strike, the actors and the
cameramen-and the others that have to be employed in producing
a film.

This is not a situation where you have the plant shut

down and there is nobody at work.

I mean supervisors really

go in there to update their records, or something.
QUESTION:

To keep the heat on, or something like that

MR. COME:

To keep the heat on.

You had a going

operation*
I would like to not cut in further into my colleague's
t isae.

Thank you«

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr, Come.

Mr, Keaton,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY J. KEATON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER ASSOCIATION OF
MOTION PICTURE AND TELEVISION PRODUCERS
MR, KEATON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In the time allotted to me I would like to primarily
discuss what has come to be called in this case the deprivation
theory.

It is basically a very straightforward nrrl simple

theory as It was described by the Administrative Law Judge in
this case.

It does not require consideration such as whether

something might have an effect in the future, but It deals with
the present, the time of the strike.

The basic question is

does the unionfs pressure on a supervisor not to work by coer­
cion and restraint and threats and discipline,foreseeable could
it have the effect of preventing that person from working and
thereby depriving the employer of the selected 8{b)(l)(B)
representative, thereby coercing and interfering -- excuse me
•»- coercing and restraining the employer in such selection.
The classical case on the subject, the Horner case, which Is
cited in our brief, in which there was no contract and the
union instructed union members to withhold their services,
the superintendent on the job was a union member and he, too,
was instructed not to work.

He disobeyed union orders and was

13

punished,

The National Labor Relations Board had no difficulty

finding that the employer had been coerced and restrained in the
selection of the supervisor, or this 8(b)(1)(B) representative*
because the foreseeable effect of what the union did would have
been that he would not have worked or* alternatively* if he did
work and was punished his services might not be available in the
future.

In that case there was no refusal by any of the employees

to work* including the supervisor.
unsuccessful.

The effort was manifestly

I am stressing that point.

Post Florida Power* we have a very similar situation.
In a case Involving Sklppy Enterprises* new known as Wisconsin
River Valley* which was affirmed from the Seventh Circuit,, ih
that case there was a very similar situation.
union elections, both lost,

There were two

After the election, the union

said, "We will not permit any of our members to work on this
job,' and they told the superintendent, "You cannot work or
we will punish you."

He did work end they punished him.

And,

again, the Beard held It to be an 8(b)(1)(B) and the Court
affirmed on the theory that clearly here is the foreseeable
deprivation of the employer of its 8(b)(1)(B) representative
and, therefore, coercion and restraint in his selection.
No. , the very Important point that needs to be made
is this Issue was not before the Court in Florida Power.

Why?

Because in Florida Power, first of all, at least In the Illinois
part: of Florida Power, the supervisor was told, "If you

14

want to come to work, we'd love to have you come*

If you don't

want to come to w ork, you don't have to."

They were not even

designated as 8(b)(1)(B) representatives.

They were given the

option to designate themselves.

In both cases, the union said,

"If you come to work and perform your normal supervisory function
you can do that,

We will not punish you," thereby, clearly not

Interfering, not coercing, not restraining the employer in
selection, if one accepts the view of the majority in Florida
Power that struck work is not part of collective bargaining or
grievance adjusting or not even related to it.

Because the

whole gamut of what a supervisor does could have been clone
without an interference on the part of the union.
The touchstone of the Florida Power case, actually,
in the decision was the future.
conduct of the union have?

What future effect may the

That is not necessarily needed here

even though it is present too, because he has effected the
current effect during the strike.
Now, In this case, the employer ordered the union

representatives,- to work.,

They didn 't give them an option.

Only supervisors, only In their norma1 management function.
And they were told, "If you do not come to work, we will dis­
charge
you arid we will fine you."
s
/

The union, on the other hand, said, "You cannot work
at all.

No services in any capacity whatsoever, Including,

of course, grievance adjusting and collective bargaining."

15
Mow, clearly, the union threats and the subsequent discipline
had one purpose and one purpose only.
what preceded the strike.

One just has to look at

Reactivation of withdrawn members,

if you please, who had no loyalty or obligation to the union
whatsoever, who were paying no dues and had no union benefits.
They were pulled back into the union by a mandate in order to
put them under the union's yoke and enable the union to force
them not to work, and, thereby, prevent the employer from
s elec ting r epresentafeiv es,
Mow, whether or not there was collective bargaining
during the strike, I submit, is not really relevant, collective
bargaining in the sense of negotiating a contract,

The impor­

tant thing is that these people who went to work were authorized
to negotiate contracts, they were designated to negotiate con­
tracts.

They were authorized and designated to settle .griev­

ances,
' Mow, the union was in no way here relying on any
appeals to the loyalty of the supervisors.

Quite the contrary.

It was bringing them back, drafting them, if you will.

Many of

them were associate members who did not have the right to vote
on the strike rules and didn't vote on them.
to resign.

They were locked in.

No one 'was allowed

And in those circumstances

they were told, "If you come to work in any capacity, we will
do terrible things to you, not only now but for fee future,
namely, you will never be able to work again," putting maximum

16

pressure on chase people in order to force them not to work
now and thereby coercing the employer for the present as well
as for the future.
The union argues here* basically* four points in
defense of its position. First of all* it says that there is
no 8(b)(1)(B) because its efforts were unsuccessful.

A lot of

people came to work * paid fines* attempted to expel, until the
membership reversed them.
Secondly* that the motive of the union here was not
established to prevent the performance of 8(b)(1)(B) work or*
indeed* the manner of such performance.
And* thirdly* the union argues* in effect* that
8(b)(1)(B) is designee] to protect the supervisor* rather than
the employer* but only in the performance of collective bar­
gaining and grievance adjusting functions.
All those premises* I would submit* are totally
wrong.
And

13

Beginning with the first one, success if not required.
can cut through all the other possibilities arid go

straight to Florida Power because when this Court said in
Florida Power that a violation can be found only if it may
adversely affect the conduct of the supervisor* very obviously
the Court did not say 'will'’ affect.

It said "msy” affect.

There dees not have to be success* even in terms of Florida
Power, itself.

And* again in Florida Power* this Court cited

disapproval — cases where an 8(b)(1)(B) had been found when an

17

attempt was made to force an employer to accept only union
members as supervisors.

So without going beyond the decision

of this Court in Florida Power# it is manifestly clear that
all that's involved is attempts and not success.

The number of

cases in 8(b)(1)(B) involving only attempts are legion.
The union relies on an 8(a)(3) case to argue to the
contrary,

8(a)(3) does not deal with coercion and restraint.

It deals with discrimination# where motive is important# and
a lot of other things are Important that are not important under
personal restraint.

As to the motive in this situation# in­

cidentally# the question here is clearly not why the union was
doing it# but what the effect on the employer is.
issue.

That is the

If he

is# no one cares why the union did what it did.
Again# turning to the FI or ids. Power language# the
question is what the effect' Is# not whet the motivations were,
8(b)(1)(B)# contrary to what the union suggests in its supple­
mentary brief# Is not intended to protect supervisors.

It is

Is afforded to the employer in his selection of supervisors.
And# furthermore# that protection is afforded to the employer
not in the performance of the function# but in the selection
of the person who will perform the function.

That’s the issue.

New# as to the performance of the function, there was

18

an argumenti, there was a discussioni, questions from the Court
to counsel for the union in which counsel for the union conceded
that if a supervisor came in with an affidavit# I believe was
the language, stating, "I will do only 8(b)(1)(B) work.

I will

only adjust grievances and bargain collectively,*' then, indeed,
the union could not punish him*
Well# Your Honors, looking at this realistically
rather than academically, what we have here is a concession
that a man who may be paid as much as $10,000 a week as a
producer of a motion picture# or even more, can be brought in
by an employer to sit there for a day, a week, a month or maybe
a year, until a grievance arises which he has a right to adjust.
No one knows when grievances occur,.

No one can predict.

And

to aey that employers can bring in supervisors for the sole

purpose of' doing 8(b)(1)(B) work is to say that it can be
made economically impossible for them to make a selection and,
therefore, they have to select someone else.
To me# the situation is absolutely in no way differ»
ent from the situation in California Cottage Company., 208 NLRB
99-h page 1004, affirmed by the Court cf Appeals for the
District of Columbia, 515, Sub. Sec. 1018# in which this Courtdenied Cert, where a labor organisation, a longshoremen1a union
of the Pacific Maritime Association# entered into a contract
in which they said, "If any ccmplalner -has to'be handled that
has not been stopped by longshoremen, then we would impose a

19
pact on those cexplainers," and it was a pretty stiff pact.
And the Board held and the Court affirmed that the imposition
of that pact was exactly the same thing as saying, "We will not
handle the coinplainers« "
And, I submit, in the same way, in this case, one
cannot say that the 8(b)(1)(B) rights of the employer to select
/

their representatives are really protected if he has

are very clearly managerial work.

Well, the A to H functions
First of all, the contract

says they are not covered by the contract but performed by
excluded personnel.

And secondly, by their very nature, the

decisions involved are management decisions.

In this respect,

the -is' ork differs importantly from the Florida Power type work
for three reasons.
First of all, it clearly was not- work that was struck
work in the legal sense of the word, or bargaining unit work
in tie legal sense.

But more importantly, it is managerial

work,

It is managerial work of any sort from which grievances

flew.

If someone is performing management work, that's how

grievances come about.

And if the person who is a manager

performing these functions has grievance adjustment authority,

20
as all these people did* then It necessarily follows that the
performance of these management functions is* quote*

ORAL ARGUMENT OB' CHARLES G. BAKALY* ESQ. *
ON EEHALF 01? THE PETITIONER AMERICAN BROADCASTING COMPANIES
MR. EAKALY:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please

the C ourt:
I would like to make one observation concerning the
f

i

deprivation theory before I talk about the adverse carry over

21

effect; theory.
The Guild contends that the Board did not make
findings that the threats were made to others than those who
worked»

I would like to submit that that statement is er­

roneous, And In the Board's decision in the petition at Appendix
B~3 the Boax’d goes on to say that it "sustains the complaints,,
alleged violations of Section 8(b)(1)(B) of the Act In toto."
And 13(d) of the second amended complaint alleges that eea­
rn enci.ng in February through the final edition of the strike
rules and in Rule 30* its blacklist rule,, and by ether actions
it threatened numerous persons occupying the positions of the
hyphenates* "that for all times in the future no member of
Respondent would work with or perform services for them, if
they failed to honor or otherwise support the strike described
in paragraph 10 above,”
That, I submit, was a finding by the Board that there
were threats to hyphenates other than those who crossed, the
picket lines, that they would be threatened and blacklisted if
they did cross the picket line and failed to honor the strike.
Now* with respect to the second theory of the Board
which I would like to direct most of my time to, the adverse
carry over effect theory begins with this Court’s decision in
Florida Power* where* as it has been said* the Court stated
that the union's discipline of one of its members, a supervisory
employee, can constitute a violation of 8(b)(1)(B) only when

22
that discipline may adversely effect the supervisor’s conduct
in performing

the duties of or in acting in his capacity as

a grievance adjuster or collective bargainer,
Nov?* this conduct of the Guild* in this case* which
Judge Moore in his dissent in the Second Circuit eliaracterised
as the Guild's

interarum conduct* certainly would have an

adverse carry over effect to supervisors in the future.
only are the fines absolutely horrendous

Hot

$50*0,00 even to some­

body making $5*000 a week* is a substantial sum of money —
the threat to-expel from the union is certainly substantial,
but more- importanly, the blacklisting threat to creative people
is absolutely abhorrent.
The; fact that after the strike the Guild rescinded
Rule 30 really did not absolve the Guild or does the after
the fact reduction of the $50*000 fine take away the fact that
the threats were made and they had an effect.

The Guild or any

other union could blacklist in the future if this Court holds
such conduct lawful,

And furthermore* the role of dishonor was

not rescinded at all and there is evidence that it may well' have
continued in effect.
Nov-* while the Guild ergv.es that individual members*
acting alone, may have been able to refuse to work with* as they
call them, "scabs*" certainly they couldn't do it in concert
ancl they couldn't do it if the Guild suggested it or condoned
it and we submit that the evidence here is certainly very

23
strong that that occurred,
Now* the union says well, the employer could take
care of the effects of this after the strike toy requiring
resignations. In other words, they could require supervisors
to resign after the strike and then in the future they wouldn’t
have the power to submit to discipline.
That really couldn't happen in this case,

In the

first place^ the blacklist and the threat of the blacklist is
still there,
QUESTION:

You say the putting out of a blacklist or

a list of the people unions regards as scabs is* by Itself,
violative of the Act?
MR, BAKALY:

Yes* I think so, Your Honor,

By the

union?
QUESTION:
MR, BAKALY:

Yes,
To say you will not work with other

members wher your whole livelihood depends on: ycur ability to
attract the best creative peoples yes, I think that's definitely
coercion,
QUESTION:

Well, is there any difference in the

labor law between creative people and carpenters?
MR, BAKALY:

I don’t argue there is a difference.

Here the associate producer and the director -- their value of
their services is the ability to get outstanding creative
people to work with them.

It Is not quite the same as a

24
carpenter or someone working with a carpenter»

So I think

there may well be a difference in this industry because of
that situation*
Bub, nevertheless, the answer to the question about
resignation after the strike whether that was the remedy for
the employer, the blacklist would still be there.

And remember

that the record is clear that the Guild had the right to pre­
vent resignation for two years after the strike of any member.
Vie submit that the self-help option rule is not
valid: in this case because of the fact that a substantial
percentage of the management people com.es from the rank and
file and will return to positions as writers as time passes.
And as a practical matter resignation just is hog going to get
us the kind of producers that we need.

Producers have to have

the ability to work with the writers and, therefore, we feel
that the self-help options are really not valid.
There is no question but what this conduct did
engender fear in the supervisors and it engendered fear in
those who adjusted writers’ grievances. It engendered fear in
those who adjusted grievances of other employees, because
employees don't differentiate between the kind of union that
makes the threat.

One union makes the threat and they feel

that any union could also make a similar threat.
The record Is replete with the evidence of the effects
of these threats upon individuals, and I won’t go into that at

25
this point in time*
The carry over effect clearly restrains the selection
of a supervisor, as the statute sets forth.

If a union can-

by threats and by fines* change the way a supervisor; performs,
it haSi in effect, negated the employer's selection and has
changed the supervisor.
In the legislative hist cry. Sene, tor Taft talks about
Mr. X and Mr,, Y,

Well, let's suppose that Mr. X v/as a person

who rigorously enforces the contract and keeps the union
employees toeing the mark and Supervisor Y is very easy and
very soft upon the employees.

And if that employer wants

Supervisor X, certainly if the union can fine Supervisor X to
such an extent to turn him into Supervisor Y, a supervisor that
acts better toward the union members and softer toward them,
he has, in effect, changed, the union has, in effect, changed
the selection of that employer from X to Y.

Have these fines had any such : effect -In

ORAL ARGUMENT QP JULIUS REICH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF 0? THE RESPONDENTS
MR* REICHi

Mr* Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In our view, there are two things that were clearly
stated in Florida Power which this Court said to the Board it
has to consider and which the Board has not considered.

And in

not considering it, the Board was able to crane up with the re­
sult with which it has come up.

Those two things are that,

first, employers have an option, an unfettered option, to have
their supervisors withdraw their membership in unions, not
joint unions, thereby resolving what was said in 1947, the
conflict of loyalties possibility, where a supervisor has
loyalties to the union and to the employer.
And the second point was that Section 3(b)(1)(B) was
designed to protect employers in two discreet functions,
collective bargaining and adjustment of grievances.
Now, in order for the Board to find a violation in
this case, it has had to ignore the Court’s rationale and
ignore the legislative history.
QUESTION:

Suppose an employer orders an employee to

come to work and to perform grievance functions.
"Please come to work.

He says,

I've got some grievances to be settled.

Will you please come and settle them for me.'
crosses the picket line and is fined.

And the employee

And he has crossed the

30

picket line to perform those duties and performs them and is
fined for it.
Now, is that a violation?
MR, REICH:
QUESTION:

That's a violation.
If he says, "Please come to work,"

generally, and part of his duties happen to be settling
grievances and he does settle them, and the employee is then
fined by the union; what about that?
MR. REICH:

That may or may not be a violation under

thes e c 1 rc urns ta nc es.
In Oakland Mailers, the Board took the position that
a supervisor who is disciplined for the manner in which he
adjusts grievances, the manner in which he carries out his
supervisory functions, that the union violates the Act by
restraining and coercing the employer through such discipline,
Under Oak 1 ant! Mallers, that would be a violation.

It would be

a violation if the union restrained and if the union disciplined
the supervisor for the manner or because he adjusted grievances.
This decision goes beyond Cak land Ma i 1 ers because the
Board takes the position that it is not necessary to show that
the supervisor had any grievance functions when he crossed the
line.

As an example of that, I cite you to the case of the

story editors.
writers.

The story editors in our case only supervised

This was a successful strike, there were no writers

to supervise.

There was no grievance to adjust.

There was no

31
bargaining for the story editors to do.

Despite that, the

Board proceeds on the theory that so long as he has the
authority, whether used or not, to adjust grievances or to
engage in collective bargaining, there is a violation.
And we understand the law to be that the Board must
come up with evidence that the union disciplined the super­
visor because of the manner of his performance of his 8(b)(1)(B)
functions or because he performed 8(b)(1)(B) functions.
QUESTION:
"Please come to work.
settled.

do if an .employer says to an employee,
X may have some grievances to be

Come over here and sit around and if there are any

I want you to settle them."

And he goes and no grievances^

and he comes home and he's fined.
What about that?
MR, REICH:

I would say no fine.

I would say that

discipline in that case would violate the Act.
QUESTION:

Are you saying that the Board's ruling

can be set aside here, as was done by the Court of Appeals and
leave open MaHers good law?
MR. REICH:

That's right.

I don't think that this

ruling has anything to do with Oakland Mailers because the
Board in this case went beyond Oakland Mailers.
QUESTION:

Florida Power and Light did not overrule

Oakland Mailers , did it?
MR. REICH:

No> I am not suggesting that it did.

32
X am not suggesting that this Court even has to get to Oakland
Mailers.

I am suggesting that, under the theory expressed by

the Board, it has gone beyond Oakland Mailers.
The carry over theory which the Board expresses says
that because a supervisor will be deterred by the discipline on
this occasion from crossing the picket line in future strikes
the discipline is a violation of the Act.

Note 5* of the

Board's reply brief.
That simply Ignores what this Court took eight pages
to stress in Florida Power, namely, that the employer can avoid
this carry over effect in a future strike by. requiring that the
supervisor withdraw his membership from the union or by not
having permitted him to be a member in the first place.
QOBTXQN:

There is a difference in this case.

These

employees wo ,-e told very unambiguously before the strike 'began
that they could nut resign during cna course of a strike and
that is a substantial difference

,n

fact between this case and

Florida Powo :• end Light and Illinois Bell and the other; isn't
it?
MR, REICH:
difference.

You are right, Yc-ur Honor, it is a

While I would argue, first of all, I would point

out that Mr. Bakaly was incorrect when he said that the rule
was that yoi couldn't resign for two years.

Not that it makes

a substantial amount of difference, but the rule was that you

33
couldn't resign for six months after negotiations.

And that xvas

at page 579 of the Appendix.
The rule was that you could resign prior to entering
into negotiations,

bo that the employer had the option before

the strike started, before the negotiations started.

I acknowl­

edge that this case is a little bit more difficult because of
that, but that doesn't make any difference to the Board's theory
because it found a violation on this same theory in other cases,
*

one which is presently before this Court on a petition for
certiorari, the Hammond case, regardless of the fact that there
was not that restraint of resignation.
What it comes down to, as both Mr. Bakaly and
Mr. Keaton argued, is that it is too onerous for us to require
our supervisor members to vlthdraw from membership in the union.
And, in fact, the Board found in this case that it was a sub/

stantia1 benefit to the employers to have their supervisors
members of the union.
But that's not the line that this Court should draw,
that's the line that Congress drew when Congress said that the
option is with the employers, and if it is too onerous then the
employers have to petition Congress
thing up.

02*

they have to give some­

They have to give something up in terms of negoti­

ating something in the agreement or, as they did in this case,
what they did was to tell the supervisors, "We will reimburse
you for any fines you are required to pay, and we will provide

34
a lawyer for your defense."

And that's what happened.

Our view is that in Oakland Mailers the Board found
a violation by union discipline for the; manner In which the
supervisors carried out their supervisory duties.
In the present set of cases, the Board says that it
doesn’t matter how the supervisor carries out his supervisory
duties, and it doesn't matter whether he, in fact,, does any
supervisory duties,.

In this case., we have what we've described

in our supplemental brief as non-struck: rank and file work,
that’s the A to H work, but that's not an issue so far as the
Board is concerned.

Any discipline for any reason, other than

performing 50$ rank and file struck work, is in the Board ‘s
view violation.
And that, It seems to us, overlooks the second major
point that this Court stressed in Florida Power, namely, that
there is a distinct difference between 8(b)(1)(B) functions.—
the two things, collective bargaining and grievance adjustment
-- and those functions that are normal supervisory functions
that are contained in Section 211 of the Act,
The Board simply obliterates the distinction between
them and doesn't even allude to that distinction in this
Court's decision.

In this case, a violation was found despite,

as I said, the fact that there was scant evidence of any
8(b)(1)(B) functions by anybody and no evidence of any
8(b)(1)(B) functions, at least With respect to story editors.

35
As an afterthought, in the Board's supplemental brief,
they state that the employers were restrained and coerced be­
cause in the interim, between the time that the union announced
its strike rules and the time that the supervisors came to work,
the employers didn’t know whether they would have supervisors
at work, and therefore their production expectations were up
/

in the air.
I think it is sufficient to point that the Board 's
argument to that effect njas not supported by a citation to the
record or by a citation to a Board finding, because there was
none.
With respect to the threats, the Board based its
findings of violation on the conclusion that since the dis­
cipline is a violation, the threat is a violation.

And if that

is the Board's theory, then the same arguments that are made
with respect to the discipline, are also applicable to the
threats.
The Board's brief goes on to state the deprivation
theory.

And in our view, the deprivation theory requires, at

a minimum, that at least under Oakland Mailers that there be
evidence that a person was restrained and coerced, a person
was disciplined for the manner in which he performed his super­
visory functions, a finding which was not made and which was
deemed not relevant to the Board's theory.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE GOLD, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF AFL-CXO, AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR, GOIi>:

Mr, Chief Justice, arid may it please the

Court:
In the time I have, I would like to begin by outlining
the Board's various approaches to Section 8(b)(1)(B)* to stating
the defects in those approaches as we see them, and finally to
suggesting what we consider to be the proper reading of that
provision.
For the first twenty years after this provision
which had received the support of botii the Majority and the
Minority In the Senate

one of the very few provisions in

Taft-Hartley to do so — was enacted, the Board took the
position, consistent with the language and legislative history,
that if a union applied economic pressure directly against an
employer to get him to change his collective bargaining or
grievance handling representative, that was a violation of the
law.

And we take no issue at all whatever with that reading of
!

the statute,

'I ■ '
As the Court described the change in the Board 's
thinking in the Oakland Mailers case, the Board moved on to
\

the proposition that disciplinary action against an individual,
a supervisor member, for the way he performs his grievance

8(b)(1)(B) says nothing about supervisors.

MR, GOLD: That's why I corrected myself'* Mr, Justice
Stewart,
QUESTION:

Or supervisory functions.

MR, GOLD:

We agree with that point entirely.

What I meant to say was that in Oakland Mailers the
Board said that discipline of supervisor members for the way
they performed grievance handling or collective bargaining
functions violates the Act* as well as economic pressure
directly on the employer.

And* while I would turn to that

holding* I think it suffices to say here that at least the
Board's approach to that point had the virtue of confining
itself to the subject that Congress had indicated it wished
regulated* namely* the selection of grievance handling and
collective bargaining representatives,
QUESTION:

A representative for the purpose of

collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances may or
may not be a supervisor* in fact.

.o, it is

coincidental.
MR, GOLD:

That’s right.

And in the normal collective

bargaining situation, the one that Congress was most particu­
larly concerned about* he will not be a supervisor.
Then the Board took what we regard as the quantum
step in this progression and stated the rule,

that Section

38
8(b)(1)(B) is a general prohibition of union discipline of
supervisor members for their conduct in the course of repre­
senting the interests of the employer.

That’s the Board's

language,
And that theory came to this Court in the Florida
Power and Light case because the Board said that doing rank and
file struck work during a strike was conduct in the course of
representing the interests of the employer and discipline of
that type by the union was, therefore, a violation of Section
8(b)(1)(B).
This Court rejected both the theory as applied in
that case and, we most strenuously argue, rejected the reasoning
as well.
Since Florida Power and Light, the sum total of the
Board's recognition of this Court's decision: and its reasoning
in Florida Power and Light is to say that 8(b)(1)(B) is a
general prohibition of union discipline of supervisor members,
except for members who spend a minimal amount of time per­
forming supervisory duties.
Individual performa'

For everybody else, even if the

struck work* the pre-Florida Power and

Light rule continues to represent the Board's thinking.
So, not only has the Board ignored the reasoning of
this Court's opinion In that case, but we would submit it has
even narrowed the holding, because there can be Instances in
which a union disciplines a member for performing struck work

39
and in which the Board will say that the discipline is unlawful,
namely* a situation in which he also performs more than a
minimal amount of supervisory activity.
So* even in that situation* we say the Board has
given very little credence to this Court's approach to the
problem.
We think the defects in the Board's thinking* since
Oakland Mailers* can be summed up as follows.

First* and most

importantly* the Board destroys another interest recognized by
Congress in 1947•

The interest that it destroys is the union's

right to discipline members* which by and large was left un­
touched by Congress in 1947 and* as a historic fact —» and
this Court has noted this fact — Congress very well understood
In 1947 that unions disciplined their members.

There is

nothing left of that right under the 3oard's theory* as
regards the supervisory members.
We don't think that the Board has the authority to
view the statute as a one-value statute and to say that the
interest

protected in Section 8(b)(1)(B), that of selecting

a representative to engage in grievance handling or collective
bargaining* is so important that all other interests must be
denied and that there must be a broad prophylactic rule which
prohibits discipline* no matter what its purpose and no matter
whether or not it is intended to affect the protected interests.
QUESTION;

Would you agree that if the union fines

have to make findings of fact.

brief# it refers to this Court's opinion in the American Ship
case.

QUESTION:

Here is the Administrative law judge..

41

'It was stipulated at the hearing in this matter that counsel
for Respondent who participated in the disciplinary hearing
instituted by Respondent would testify that he took the position
at such hearing that the hyphenates charged are subject to
discipline for crossing Respondent *s picket line, without
regard to whether they crossed the picket line for the purpose
of performing bargaining services.”
Let's assume the union said, "He don’t care what you
are going to work for.

You may or you may not be performing

collective bargaining work, but even if you are you are going
to be fined, "
MR» GOLD:

I think at that point the union is taking

a terrible chance, at the least.

If they, in fact, perform

collective bargaining or grievance handling functions —
QUESTION:

Here is the Adr nlstrative Law Judge

makiiig a point, "It is clear that It has been fe nd that the
normal performance of the hyphenates' primary function in­
volves the adjustment of employee grievances."
Mow, do you accept that or not?
MR. GOLD:

I accept that, but the problem with that

point in this case is that It isn't respenseive to the issue,
because vre think the question is whether they performed such
activities during the strike, and if sc whether the union
disciplined them for doing that as opposed to performing other
activities,

42
QUESTION:

But if a threat succeeds they will never

show up* and presumably whether or not there is that sort of
work to be done they will not be there to do it,
MR, GOLD:

In the situation of a threat * it may well

be that the proper rule is that the union has to more carefully
state its intent than was done here.

For example* if there are

people i^ho perform both grievance handling work and other work
for the employer* it might be that the proper rule is that the
union must say.

"We will discipline people ivho cross our picket

line and perform non“8(b)(l)(B) work.”

X wouldn't argue that

that is a rule that the Board could not reach.

All I say at

this point is that the Board is nowhere near having thought
through the problem to that extent* because it is still taking
the. poslfcipn that whatever the individual does after he crosses
the picket line and whatever the union's purpose* there is a
violation as long as that person sometimes handles a, grievance.
And that, we bel:Leve*is absolutely wrong.QUESTION:

But your General Counsel at the hearing

apparently took the other extreme position, judging from the
colloquy that Justice White read,
MR, GOID:

X certainly do disagree arguing for the client X am arguing for,
QUESTION:

I don't doubt you have the authority to do

43
ifc»
MR, GOLD:

I £m not sure what my authority would be?

representing a particular union.

But at any rate, our view

is that the Board has to find that the individual who is
disciplined actually performed grievance handling or collec­
tive bargaining work* and that the union fined him or otherwise
penalized
' him for doing so. And that means in a situation in which some­
body crosses a picket line and performs only grievance handling
or collective bargaining work and the union fines him, the
General Counsel would have a relatively easy case, the Board’s
General Counsel would have a relatively easy case to prove.
Where somebody crosses a picket line and performs
some grievance handling work and some other work, then you
would have the classic case that you always have under Section
8(a)(3) of the Act which prohibits employer discipline of
employees for engaging in union activities, that normally
arises,

. . .
And, as I v.ras about to say when Mr. Justice White

asked me the question that began this discussion, in the
union's supplemental brief they refer to the American Ship case
and ifc does seem to us that that's helpful in putting this
section in perspective.

In 1935, Congress said to employers

"You can't discipline employees for engaging in protected
activities," but didn't prohibit employers from disciplining
people for breaking shop rules.

44
The Board has never* and we believe it is plain it
could not* say that because employees will suspect that when a
union activist is disciplined for breaking a shop’s rule they
will — everybody in the plant will fear discipline, that the
employers have lost their right to discipline people for
breaking shop rules.
And, because employees both engage in union activity
and to earn a living continue to work for an employer and are
subject to his rules, the Board in an 8(a)(3) case must show,
not only that the person who was fired or otherwise disciplined
was engaged in protected activity, but also that the employer's
purpose was to punish him for doing that,
QUESTION:

The thing that brought on these pro-

ceedings was the fine, I take it, after a proceeding within
the union.
MR. GOLD:

Yes.

QUESTION:

What’s the union's burden before it can

fine a person who crosses a picket line?
apparently, in those hearings, was,

The union's position,

"We don't care what you cross

the picket line for, we are going to fine you."
the record shows.

Is the union free tc do that?

That is what
Doesn't it

have some burden to bear to show that it wasn't — what its
purpose was?

They seem to take the position that it doesn't

make any difference whether you cross the picket line to
adjust grievances or not.

You are going to be fined.

45
MR* GOLD:

Well, the situation the union found itself

in here* as I understand it* is that these people.* disciplined
people*did not appear at the trial* is that correct?
most did not,

Yes*

So the union is left with the situation that

QUESTION:

I just give you the Administrative Law

Judge’s —> the second time that he said it in his opinion —»
"It was stipulated that Respondent’s counsel during the
disciplinary hearings was not concerned with what work the
hyphenates did when working during the strike."
MR, GOLD:

If I may — It may have been the

Respondent’s argument before the Administrative — that may
have been the Respondent’s argument before the Administrative
Law Judge.
QUESTION:

This is a description of what the union's

position was during the disciplinary hearings inside the 1
union,
MR, GOLD:

My view on that is if the union goes

forward in that way and the people actually.,, performed grievance
handling activity* I think that the General Counsel* by proving;
both the performance and the union’s disinterest has proved
bad motive.
But let’s take another case.

Suppose the union

fines a particular individual for working for the employer and
it turns out that he didn’t do any Section 8(b)(1)(B) work for

46
that employer,

I don't see how the union has committed any

violation at all.

Certainly* if an employer disciplines some­

body for breaking a shop rule and It turns out that that
employee was not engaged in any protected activity* he hasn't
violated 8(a)(3),

but we are fining you.

And we are not go.ing to make any record

about what you did or didn't do* but you are fined."
MR, GOLD: As I say* in that situation* if the in­
dividual. in fact* performed Section 8(b)(1)(B) activity it
would be my view that he may ~~ that the union might well
in that situation commit a violation,
QUESTION:

Well* then* how about this finding of

the Administrative Law Judge that the duties of these
hyphenates did include collective bargaining and adjustment of
grievances?
MR, GOLD:

As I attempted to say before* that's a

general statement of what their overall job description in­
cludes,

As Mr. Reich has pointed out* at least one group of

the disciplined individuals here were the story writers who
could not have performed grievance handling or collective
bargaining functions during the strike because they didn't
engage in collective bargaining and because there were no

47
writers there to supervise and handle grievances.

So the Board

doesn't care at all whether or not the individuals performed
Section 8(b)(1)(B) functions.

It finds a violation on the

general theory that no matter what the union fines people for,
what its Interest is* what its motive is and what they've done
during the strike* it is illegal because it may have some effect
on their., on the way that they will carry out their collective
bargaining 03’ grievance handling functions in the future.
And what we say Is that's just like saying that
whenever an employer disciplines somebody for breaking a shop
rule that 's a violation of 8(a)(3) on the grounds that employees
may in the future fear to engage in protected activity* and
whether or not that Individual actually broke the shop rule and
the employer was motivated by the breach of the rule.
The many ways -- and the Board has had 40-odd years
of experience -- in proving what motive is in these situations
where people are sometimes engaged in protected activity and
sometimes engaged in unprotected activity* and you don't solve
the problem by taking away in the one instance the employer's
right to discipline which he had prior to 1935 or to take away
frcm the union completely its right to discipline these super­
visor members which unions had prior to 1947 and which there
is no indication that Congress intended to take away.
QUtioTION:

Mr. Gold* do you agree that some of the

hyphenates refrained from crossing the picket line in response

48
to the union's prohibition?
MR, GOLD:

Your Honor., in regard to that, we agree

with the statement made in the union's supplemental brief that
it might well have been within the Board's province to find that
as a fact if it had inquired into the issue.

But it did not

attempt to do so and all we can say is that if that issue were to
go back to the Board for it to make a determination of whether
the threat had that effect and it found that it did and there
was substantial evidence to support it, we would not say that
the Board hadn't shown a violation to that extent.
QUESTION:

Wouldn't the Board, in your submission,

also have to find that had they crossed the picket lines these
hyphenates would have performed 8(b)(1)(B) functions?
MR. GOLD:

Yes.

I apologize.

What I meant is would

have proved a case as to those people who would have performed
8(b)(1)(B) functions during the strike.

In other words, if

the union threatened the story writers who had no 8(b)(1)(B)
functions to perform, and concededly so as far as the record
shews, \ve don't think there would be a violation.

But if a

union threatened somebody who — to use an example that
Mr. Justice White has given -- if the union was to say to
somebody who walked up to a picket line and said, "I've been
called in to adjust grievances," and the union says, "If you
do so, we will fine you," in that situation we would agree-QUESTION:

Let's take this situation.

Let's assume

49
there were only, say, half a dozen hyphenates and all of them
in response to union's rule and their instructions not to cross
the line, refrained from doing so.

At that point, no one could

be sure, I suppose, whether or not there would be any need for
a grievance adjustment.

Suppose the record was silent as to

whether or not such a need actually arose.

Would there be an

8(b)(1)(B) violation there?
MR. GOLD:

Our view on that, Mr. Justice Powell, would

be that part of the General Counsel's case would be to show
that the employer had grievance handling or collective bargain­
ing activities that he wanted performed, that he asked these
people to do.

I think that's the first point, in his case.

QUiio?JCx'J;

Would it not o@ arguable, enough, thau

management was entitled to have at least some of its repre­
sentatives there to deal with situations that perhaps are
unforeseeable that might arise?
MR. GOLD:

I would say that in a situation in which

the employer says, "I want you to come to work to perform
grievance handling functions or collective bargaining functions
as they arise," and the union threatened to fine the individuals
who obeyed that order, that you would have an unlawful threat.
But if the employer said, "I want you to come to work and do
whatever 1 toll you to do," then, it is our view, that the
union would violate the law only if the individuals actually
did one of these two!8(b)(1)(B) functions and nothing else.

50
or that they did these ~~ they performed these 8(b)(1)(B)
functions, as well as other activity, and the union was motivated
by their performance of 8(b)(1)(B) functions to discipline
them.
That's the line we draw.

If they do only 8(b)(1)(B)

functions, we concede the union can neither threaten them nor
actually discipline them.

If they perform both protected and

unprotected activity, then we say the situation presented here
is the same as the classical 8(a)(3) case, and the General
Counsel to prove a violation must shew that the union was moti­
vated by a desire to punish them for performing the 8(b)(1)(B)
functions or for the way they performed them.
We believe that that protects the employer's Interest
to select anyone

he wants to perform 8(b) (1)(B) functions, and

protects the union's right to discipline members for breaching
the union's rules against working during a strike.
each part of this overall spectrum precisely whe ■

It gives

one can judge, Congress believed ought to be given to the
employer and to the union.

And it destroys nothing of sub­

stance of either side.
Now, it is argued on the employer's side that they
don't very much like what Congress gave them, because what
would really benefit them would be the right to have individuals
handle both grievances and collective bargaining and perform
other supervisory functions, and have those individuals immune

51
from discipline* because it is inconvenient or expensive to
them to have somebody only adjust grievances or only engage in
collective bargaining*

They would like to combine these various

functions in one person and assure that that individual cannot
be disciplined for anything he does.
Our view on that is that there are many things we
would like as i^ell that the statute doesn’t provide us and
that there is no way that we can see ;Ln reading the statute
which would give the employers what they want without destroying
entirely this other interest which Congress recognised in 19^7>
QUESTION:

Mr. Gold* maybe I misunderstood you.

I

thought you said that if a supervisor performed 100$'8(b)(1)(E)
work he would be immune from discipline.

I think you conceded

that.
MR. GOLD:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Suppose he didn’t pay his union dues*

couldn’t he be disciplined for that?
MR. GOLD:

He would be immune from discipline for

his conduct ss an employer representative.

I don’t know of any

case in which -QUESTION:

Is he just immune from discipline while

performing 8(b)(1)(B) work?

I mean* as I say* he didn’t pay

his dues or some other neutral requirement* he would be like any
other supervisor* wouldn't he?
MR. GOLD:

I would think so,

I've never even seen a

52
complaint issued which said that supervisor members, even when
they handled grievances, are Immune from the normal legal
requirements.

Our view is that what Congress said was that if

you credit Qa kland Mailers, that we can't go after them for
performing 8(b)(1)(B) functions or the way they perform
8(b)(1)(B) functions, and what the Board is saying is that we
can't do anything to them ever because of the supposed carry
over or deprivation effect, and that :ls the difference

It is the same type of theory presented to this

Court in Teams tars Union versus Labor Board and labor Board

53
v» News Syndicate, the hiring hall casea, where they said that
any union involvement in the hiring process, through its own
representative, was per se a violation because the people
subjected to that system would fear that the union would act
improperly.

And this Court in those cases said no it is like

8(a)(3) and the Board must prove its case.
Thank you, very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Gold.

Mr, Come, you have about four minutes left.
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORTON J. COME, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER NLRB
MR, COME:

I would just like to dwell on one point.

As was pointed out earlier, we are net. dealing here with
Section 8(a)(3) which proscribes discrimination encourage or
discourage union membership, where it is well settled that
ordinarily motive is a crucial agreement.
Vie are dealing here with 8(b)(l);(B) which proscribes
restraint and coercion of the employer and it is equally well
settled there the test is normally the reasonable tendency of
the conduct.
Now, the union here, as I understand its position,
concedes that if the union threatens a supervisor for going to
work to perform grievance adjustment and collective bargaining
functions, that would be a violation of 8(b|(l)(B|s -mms if
the threats were not effective.

The employer would be restraints

and coerced by such a threat,
They say, however, that there was no finding here
that the union intended to discipline them for performing
grievance adjustment and collective bargaining functions.
There are two answers to that contention.

In the

first place, on this record, they cannot be heard to make such
an argument, because in view of the trial examiner’s findings
that Mr. Justice White alluded to, the union made it quite clear
that they were indifferent to whatever work it was that the
hyphenates performed.

They were going to be disciplined for

And where a union expresses its threat that broadly

in a circumstance where the Individuals involved are cloaked
with collective bargaining and grievance adjustment functions,
this must be deemed to have Intended to affect their collec­
tive bargaining and grievance adjustment functions.
Beyond that, we submit that it is Irrelevant whether
the union intended to discipline the hyphenates for performing
only grievance adjustment and collective bargaining functions,
because in the real world the employer doesn't select a
representative just for grievance adjustment or collective
bargaining functions.
