MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Nos. 77-262 and 77-375» Duke Power Company and United
States Nuclear Regulatory Commission against Carolina Environ­
mental Study Group,
Mr, Griffith.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVE C . GRIFFITH. JR,, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER (No. 77-262)
MR, GRIFFITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The United States District Court for the Western
District of North Carolina declared the limitation of liability
provisions within the Price-Anderson Act to be unconstitutional.
Juke appealed to this Court on two questions.

First, Is the

cause justiciable under Article 3 of the Constitution and, two,
whether the limitation of liability provisions is unconstitu­
tional under the Due Process Clause?
The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 was passed by Congress
to encourage the widespread application of the peaceful use of
atomic energy in medicine, agriculture and industry, but
particularly in the generation of electric power.

By 1957 ^

Congress had determined that economics was the foremost obstacle
to the development of nuclear power plants.
I say this because of the "but for" argument itfhich is
s,o central both in Plaintiff's brief and in the opinion of the

4
court below.

If there is a "but for" argument or cause In this

matter, it is with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and not with
the amendments that consist of the Price-Anderson Act,
But Congress determined that there was a further
problem to the development of the nuclear power plant and that
was the potentially great liability exposure for a large ac­
cident, although the probabilities of such an accident occuring
were exceedingly small, so small, in fact, that they were not
being creditable, although the possibility did exist.
The Price-Anderson amendment

to the Atomic Energy

Act of 1954 was the congressional solution to this problem.
Price-Anderson has two objectives. The first is to protect the
public against uncompensated loss resulting from the peaceful
uses of atomi-; energy, and second to protect industry against
the risk of unlimited liability in the unlikely and remote
event that a catastrophic accident might occur.
Limitation of liability provisions is not peculiar
to the United States with respect to nuclear power plants.
Nineteen nations have legislated similar legislation, as shown
in our Exhibit 19.

The objective of protecting the public in

Price-Anderson was accomplished in few0 ways, first, through
mandatory insurance and, second, through governmental indemnity.
QUESTION:

Does the Price-Anderson Act supersede all

State law covering recoverability of damages in this area?
M.R„ GRIFFITH:

fas, sir.

There were no State laws

5
passed with respect to the Atomic Energy Act of 195^* nor were
there any limitations of liability provisions or special acts
to compensate -QUESTION:

Well., I presume* under North Carolina law*

if an atomic plant blew up it i^ouldn't have taken a special
North Carolina statute to permit recovery for damages.
MR, GRIFFITH:
QUESTION:

No* sir* it would not have.

Did the Price-Anderscn Act* in effect*

pre-empt State damage remedies in this situation?
MR * GRIFFITH:

Yes* it removed the common law remedy

of unlimited liability,
QUESTION:

Could each State do that on its own?

MR, GRIFFITH:

I don't think so in this particular

case* since Congress -QUESTION:

I should have narrowed it.

Not as to

atomic energy* but could each State on its own simply provide
that there would be no actions for injuries of the described
cha racfcer?
MR, GRIFFITH:

Yes* sir* I think so.

Compensation law's are State laws.

The Workmen's

All States have those.

There are limitations on common law rights.
QUESTION:

Once the Pric e-Anders on Act had been

enacted then you Indicated there is a preemption of the whole
field.
MR, GRIFFITH:

Yes* sir.

6
QUESTION:

Doesn't the Act say so in so many words?

MR. GRIFFITH:

Well* sir* this Court has found that

in the Northern States Power case that Congress has very clearly
preempted this field.
QUESTION:

My question was:

Does the Pric©“Anderson

Act say that to the extent of this limitation it preempts all
State lav;?

Does it say so in terms?
MR. GRIFFITH:

I don't recall any specific words with

respect to that,■no, sir.
QUESTION:

Certainly, it would not have materially

advanced the purpose that you say it was intended to serve if
it simply provided for a limitation cf liability and diversity
actions in Federal District Courts, but placed no limitation
of liability on State courts, would it?
MR, GRIFFITH:

No, sir.

What it did, in effect,

was to create a Federal fund, if I might, out of which claimants
from a possible accident might proceed against, rather than the
individual industries involved if the accident were unlimited
liability.
QUESTION:

Doing that, doesn't that have to preempt

State -MR. GRIFFITH:

Yes, sir, 1 think it does, absolutely.

In 1966, Congress created absolute liability for any
substantial nuclear accident by requiring mandatory waivers of
defenses.

Further amendments were made in 1975.

The statute

7
of Limitations waiver was extended further and a second selfinsurance pool of liability insurance was established and this
will phase out the governmental indemnity and will allow the
limitation of liability# currently $5^0 millions to move upward.
By 1985# that limit could be $1 billion.
Congress also expressly stated in the Act in 1975#
with respect to the possibility that an accident might exceed
$500 million that It will "take whatever action is deemed neces­
sary and appropriate to protect the public from the consequences
of a disaster of such magnitude."

I

Inhere are now 62 operating nuclear power reactors in
the United States# producing approximately 10$ of the nation's
electricity# and there are approximately 150 either planned or
under construction.
No accident at a nuclear power reactor# involving
radiation injury# disease or death to a member of the public
has ever occurred.
not possible.

A nuclear explosion at a power reactor is

The only way that a catastrophic accident could

occur would be coal melt which breaches the containment building
and releases a large amount of radioactive material.

Just like

a coal-fired plant# a nuclear power reactor produces heat to
turn water into steam to drive the turbines to produce elec­
tricity.

A nuclear pox*?er reactor obtains its heat from its

uranium fuel in two ways.

Approximately 93$ of the heat is

obtained by way of nuclear chain reaction# and the balance#

8
about 7$j comes from the decay of nuclear material.
The nuclear chain reaction may be stopped in a
fraction of a second, so that it produces no further heat.
the decay heat cannot be so quickly terminated.

But

A coal melt

would take place if the fuel were deprived of Its normal and
emergency cooling waters, so as to allow the heat to build up.
This could cause the fuel to melt.

The heat thereby created

could be sufficient to melt through the bottom of the building,
or possibly lead to a breach of the containment building.
Because a breach of the containment -building poses
the threat of a large-scale accident taking place, in terms of
damages to the off-site public, the greatest care is taken of
the design construction and operation of the reactor, in order
to reduce to the absolute minimum the attendant risk to the
public.
Congress passed Price-Anderson on the findings that
the risk of a very large accident occurring was exceedingly
small.

This finding has been substantiated by further and

extensive studies and the operating experience of the nuclear
power reactors.
In 1965, the Joint Committee of the Congress reported
that the likelihood of a major reactor accident was exceedingly
low, and that no reactor would be licensed in this country if
there was "a reasonable likelihood that its operation might
result in an accident of the severity contemplated by the Pr3.ce-

9
Anderson legislation.
The reactor safety study,* under the direction of
Professor Rasmussen of MIT and a professional staff of 60 per­
sons, was published in October 1975*

The study confirmed pre­

vious findings by Congress of the very low risk of a catastrophic
accident occurring.

Plaintiffs and other critics differ with

this study in terms of the extent to which the study’s estimates
of an accident of such magnitude occurring might be in error.
Plaintiff’s own witness put the error at "like a factor of 10."
Because he said, "For an error much in excess of 10 one would
find a contradiction with the present operating experience."
Now that was more than a year and a half ago;
While the court below said, "It is not a bookie,"
the unblemished operating experience of 300 reactor-years in
this country and 1,000 years worldwide, received scant attention
from the court below.

As one witness put it,

"If there were

any higher probability of an accident scenario, we would at
least have seen some damage to the public or the environment
in all of the years of reactor operating experience."
Now, addressing the questions in this case.

First,

as to the justiciability issue, we have discussed the case
or controversy issues in our main brief, pages 27 through 52,
and in Appendix A.

We stand on our arguments there and would

not further argue them, except to say in our view the mere
possibility of an injury from a postulated accident is not

10

enough to give standing.
Turning now to the arguments on the merits, Congress
has legislated in a field in 'which it has undoubted power.

It

relied primarily upon the commerce power, but there are others,
national defense, the general welfare and the bankruptcy power.
In the field of economic regulation, once Congress
has acted within Its power, the presumption of constitutionality
attaches, and in a case like this the burden is on the com­
plaining party to demonstrate that Congress has acted in an
arbitrary or irrational way.
Plaintiffs have failed to carry this burden and, by
implication vie suggest, admit that they cannot meet the
rationality standard when they suggest a higher standard of
review.

They first suggesta that the issue here is similar to

that decided in the sterilization case of Skinner v. Oklahoma.
They then retreat from that position, advocating an inter»
mediate level of rev lev/.

But that position is not held for

very long, for in the very next breath they revive the test
of Skinner when they say that Price-Anders on is the "but for
cause" of a nuclear catastrophy that is certain to occur.
They say "the fact that the Government is a principal cause
of the injury also makes this case like Skinner, since it was
the State in Skinner that ordered the sterilization."
The implication of this argument is crystal clear.
And that is that the decision by Congress to encourage the

11

peaceful applications of atomic energy in the private promotion
of nuclear power plants to provide a diverse energy source for
this country was a reprehensible decision.

Therefore-, they

argue this Court should agree with them and substitute its
judgment on this question of national policy for that of
Congress.

The decisions of this Court are clearly to the

contra ry.
This Court has repeatedly said that it is only
concerned with the power of Congress and not with its wisdom.
Only if the statute manifests a patently arbitrary classification
utterly lacking in rational justification, is it unconstituteionaI.
The test provided in Fleming v. Nestor.

But, even assuming for

the sake of argument, that a higher standard of review is
necessary, the Prlce-Anderson amendments meet a carefully
tuned balancing of alternative considerations.
Congress could have and did consider alternatives.
Among those were unlimited governmental liability and a direct
insurance program with a compensation plan,
QUESTION:

You say it meets a carefully tuned

balancing of competing considerations.

That's for the nine of

us to decide?
MRo GRIFFITH:

Yes, sir.

That is, if you go to a

higher standard of review than the rationality test.

The '

rationality test which I think ~~ end w# urgt vaay sferMftgly
in this case -- is simply one, was there tany basis on whiefrt e

12

rational finding can be made for Congress legislating in this
field? And certainly the evidence is clear that Congress had.
QUESTION:

But when it ccanes to the fine tuning*

then it's our decision* rather than Congress'.
MR» GRIFFITH:

Yes* sir* and we submit that the Act

does meet that fine tune.
The answer to the problems perceived by Congress to
the development of the nuclear power industry was PrlceAnderson* and that was to require Industry to guard against
accidents of a conceivable* though not expected magnitude* by
available insurance* to assure the public of protection above
that amount up to a point* but refused to commit in advance
public monies to pay the cost of an almost Inconceivable
catastrophe.

That result is eminently rational end reasonable.

But this Court has never applied either strict
scrutiny or an intermediate standard of review to a statute
which limits liability or otherwise modifies common law
remedies for future torts.

It has Instead considered whether

the statute serves a legitimate legislative purpose for dealing
with a perceived problem.

This* we contend* is the rationality

test,
But if more than rationality Is required* such as in
the suggestions that this Court has required in the removal of
common law remedies that a quid pro quo must be provided each
place,

VJe don't subscribe to that view* but if that is assumed

13

for argument sake, we suggest that the Act provides substantial
quid pro quo.

It assures a fund to pay claims.

absolute liability.

It Imposes

It waives short statutes of limitation.

It provides for part payment of claims without releases.

It

provides for fair treatment of latent injuries* and it elimin­
ates completely the rush to the courthouse door which would
exist without the substitution of Price“Anderson for the common
law State remedies.

It eliminates the rush to the courthouse

door to establish a claim and to perfect a judgment lien.
And funds are available to pay claims without regard to who is
liable.
Turning now to Plaintiff's argument that the remedy
provided by Price-Anderson is inadequate* this argument Is
based upon two fallacious assumptions.

The first assumption

is that the catastrophic accident they describe is certain to
occur.

The second assumption is that following such a catas­

trophic accident Congress will do nothing.
The first assumption is contrary to the conclusion
Congress reached in light of all of the information which was
before the District Court* and much mors.

And the second ae~

sumption is contrary to the pledge of Congress stated in the
law * and also contrary to the history of Congressional appropri­
ations with respect to national disasters* which it is inter“
esfclng to note Plaintiff’s acknowledge In other contexts.
Plaintiffs also attempt to explain away the analogy of the

14

limitation of liability in connection with ships and airlines*
by suggesting that in the case of ships the injured bystander
could have insured against the less* and with respect to air
lines5 the injured person may receive up to the Halt of
$75#000 per claim»
But in the case of Price-Anderson* the insurance is
provided not by the innocent bystander but by the Industry and
even with a limitation of liability of $560 million an accident
with 5#000 claimants will yield up to $112*000 per claim»
QUESTION:

If a quid pro quo were under a Constitu­

tional law required in order to limit liability in this way*
would you say that if all Congress had done was to say* "We’ll
take a careful look at the situation*" after a catastrophic
accident occurs would be enough?
MR. GRIFFITH:

Well* sir* the quid pro quo would be

provided if Congress acts after the fact.
QUESTION:

But we'll never know.

MR» GRIFFITH:

That's precisely the question we

raised in our jurisdictional —
QUESTION:

That goes to standing, too.

MR, GRIFFITH:

We will never know.

If Congress does

act «» and I think it is more logical to assume that they will
than they won’t — in the event of a catastrophe of the limits
as described in this case* then it satisfies the due process
requirement.

15

QUESTION:

Can one Congress bind the next Congress?

Can this Congress bind the future Congress?
MR. GRIFFITH:
QUESTION:

No* sir, I don't think it can.

You didn't really answer my brother

Rehnquisfc's question, as indicated by my brother Marshall.
His question was:

Would a statement of good intention to

consider this whole thing in the event of a catastrophe be
enough of a quid pro quo, assuming that quid pro quo is
constitutionally required?

You said Congressional action would

be, but that wasn't his question.
MR, GRIFFITH:

The direct answer to that, in my

opinion. Is no.
Surely the limitation of liability of six additional
and diverse energy suppliers by encouraging the private
development of nuclear power is at least as rational as are
the limitations of liability found acceptable in the shipping
and airlines industries and in the Workmen's Compensation cases.
I will reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE. BURGER:-

We will resume at 1:00

o'clock with the next argument.
(Whereupon, at 12:00 noon, the Court recessed to
reconvene at 1:00 o'clock, p.m., the same day.)

AFTERNOON SESSION
{1:02 p.ra.)
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Solicitor General,

you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WADE H, McCREE, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS (No. 77-375)

MR. McCREE:

Mr. Chief Justice, anci may it please

the Court:
This appeal requires this Court to decide whether
the provision of a comprehensive statutory program designed to
protect the public and to encourage the development of nuclear
powered electric generating facilities by providing for the
licensing and regu3.atlcn of such plants, by abolishing defenses
and extending statutes of limitations, by providing for the
establishment of financial protection for possible public
liability, that imposed a limitation of liability, is un­
constitutional is repugnant to the Fifth Amendment.
1 QUESTION:

General McCree, when you say that this

appeal requires this Court to decide the question, I take It
that's on the assumption that we adopt your view of standing.
MR. McCREE:

Indeed, and it was presumptuous to

state it so categorically.

But if the Court reaches the merits

that would be the issue that the Court would address,.
My brother has discussed the grounds set forth in
the decision of the District Court for finding, that this

17

provision of ?rice~And arson was unconstitutional, specif lea], ly
the due process ground and the equal protection ground that is
implied in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
I would like to address myself to the issue that
was not relied upon by the District Court, but that Appellees
urge in their response at pages 22 through 26 and ;Ln their
brief, that this limitation of liability constitutes a taking
of private properties for public use without just compensation.
First, we submit that there is no protaGtable property
here, within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.

There is

perhaps an expectation of recovery in the event of an action­
able wrong that has not yet occurred ard may net occur.

We

submit that there is no vested right of recovery in something
as supposititious as that, and that this is not protectable
property within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment,
Further, we submit, that there is no taking here by
the enactment of the Price-Anderson legislation.

This is a

regulatory measure and it does not ever regulate property owned
by Appellees,

It regulates property that might conceivably,

under some circumstances, affect property owned by Appellees.
QUESTION:

In your view, could the Act have equally

v/ell and equally in compliance with the Constitution provided
for no liability at. all?
MR, McCREE:
the rule.

That's the question that really tests

I can conceive of circumstances under which it

18

could* but with a different statutory scheme.

For example* the

Government* initially* had a monopoly of all fisionable material
Indeed* the statute provided that possession of facilities for
the use of fisionable material and possession or transportation
of fisionable fuel was a crime.
I suppose if the Government had kept its monopoly and
had built these plants itself it would not have had to provide
for compensation,

I suppose then compensation would be ob­

tained by anyone injured through the Federal Tort Claims Act.
Whether the Federal Tort

Claims AGt is mandated by the

Constitution* 1 am not quite sure.
QUESTION:

Well* before the Federal Tort Claims Act*

of course* there would have been no liability on the part of
the Government.
MR. McCREE:

Indeed* and* if the Court please*, that's

what I am suggesting.

If the development of nuclear powered

electrical plants had remained in the Government* I think there
is a way where

just to answer the Court Ss question — as 1

said* goes to the limit in testing the proposition.
QUESTION:

If no act had been passed at all* then

injured persons would be — Would they be left to their State
remedies in each case?
MR. McCREE:

I would* of course, suppose so* if the

Court please.
QUESTION:

But if the whole business had been left

19

with the Federal Government, there wouldn't have been any State
remedies# presumably.

There would have been an action against

the Federal Government# but that would not have existed because
of sovereign immunity# in the absence of something like a
Federal Tort Claims Act.
MR, MeCREE:

I do not understand that premise to have

been Implicit In:’the Chief Justice's question# but 2 certainly
agree with the Court.

If the Federal Government had retained

Its monopoly of atomic power# that certainly could have re­
sulted.

But here there is regulation cf property not owned by

Appellees in which Appellees have no interest.

And so, again#

we say this is not a taking, in addition to their not being
protectable property.
Finally, although Appellees don't make this argument
fully, it might be urged that if their property was taken or if
they were deprived of substantial enjoyment of it by the action
of a regulated utility, that that might constitute a taking.
We suggest that this Court has suggested that the taking of
private property by .State regulated facilities Is not a taking
by the Etate.

Therefore, we think this argument, fc’iat the

District Court did not make in support of its judgment, but
that Appellees make in their brief, also must fail, as must
their argument related to due process.
My brother «pok® abou
was an adequate quid pro quo,

tlifi -matter of roethar there
and h© was aske’d to suppose that

20

a quid pro quo is required by due process., if a remedy is to be
abolished or altered.

We submit that this Court has never

stated that a quid pro quo must be provided, but that in the
event it is required that the Congress, by providing for $560
million that are immediately available to enable any one of
these licensees to respond in damages for injury to person or
property is more than an adequate quid pro quo for the elimina­
tion -- for the limitation that's placed upon a common law
remedy here.
We also suggest that there is more than just the
$5o0 million, of course.
are advantageous.

There are venue requirements that

In partial response to the question put to

my brother by Mr. Justice Rehnquist, there is not a preemption
of State law by this litigation, but there is a grant of
original -- not exclusive, but original -- jurisdiction in
the District Court to hear actions arising out of incidents -QUESTION:

General, do you mean that the State courts,

they have jurisdiction?
MR. McCRSE:

It is my understanding, from my reading

of the Act -•*
QUESTION:

Do you also mean that the statute does

not make the case governed by Federal law?
MR. McCREE:

I think the case is governed by Federal

law.

\

QUESTION:

In whatever court --

21

MR. McCREE:

In whatever court It is filed.

QUESTION: Something like the F3LA suits.
MR, McCREE: 'I would think very much like FELA* if
the Court please.
And this grant of original but not exclusive juris­
diction is coupled with a grant of venue In a district in which
the Incident occurred* or in the case of an overseas incident
in the District Court for the District of Columbia.

And it

alio interestingly provides for removal by any person from any
other court to the appropriate district court* that is to say
the United Etates district in which the incident occurred or
to the District Court of the District cf Columbia.

So* there

again* It Is something else that's given if a quid pro quo is
required for whatever limitation has been imposed.

And we

believe there is no requirement* however* of a quid pro quo.
and if there is in a situation like this its value cannot be
calculated precisely to permit us to determine its adequacy.
Vie submit* In short* that the question here Is whether
this is a rational legislative means of removing a significant
obstacle to the achievement of a valid Federal governmental
purpose.

We believe that it is and we believe that this is

the test by \jhich It should be measured and* as such* that it
should be found constitutional.
QUESTION:

Is this a statute of the Commerce Clause?

Is that -- Congressional power =.- the basis of congressional

Adjust taking and the utilities that

have expended large sums of money would be entitled to com­
pensation .
The argument I was endeavoring to make about the
rationality of this plan in a field about which no one really
knows anything is illustrated somewhat by some of the dollars
involved here.

When the limitation was first provided -- and

the limitation has three elements

the licensed plant must

acquire the maximum amount of liability insurance available
from private sources.

Then there is a secondary liability pool

with a $5 million retroactive
licensed facility.

premium to be paid by every

And then the balance of liability up to

25
$560 million is to be taken up by the Government.
When this was first started, the maximum amount of
liability Insurance available from private sources ms $60
million.

Now it is $140 million, because the insurance industry

in the light of its experience of no accidents of the magnitude
that concerns Appellee. Also the restroactive premium pool has
grown to $315 million.

So, currently, there are $4-55 million

private dollars available for compensation under this plan.
So, the Government guarantee of the difference up to $560
million is only $105 million.

And it is projected that the

Government’s guarantee might be extinguished in 1980.

There is

a further projection that by 1985 there will be $1 billion of
private insurance, if the same trend continues and the same
experience obtains.
We submit that this proves the wisdom of the rule
enunciated by this Court of allowing the Congress the freedom
to use its judgment, as long as it is rationally informed, to
achieve legitimate governmental ends.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM B, SCHULTZ, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. SCHULTZ:

Mr. Chief Justice,, and may it please

the Court:
The fundamental flaw in Appellant's argument is that
they view the Prlce-Anderson Act as simply another regulatory
statute, and argue that it is analogous to Government regulation
of such activities as mining, or that it is analogous to
Government imposed rent control.
However, a careful examination of the Act shows that
it is not simply another regulatory statute, and that it has
four features that distinguish it from other limitations on
liability.
QUESTION:

Mr. Schultz, are you going to address

the standing question sometime during your argument?
MR. SCHULTZ:

Yes,. I v^as, ano I will address it

right now, if you would like.
QUESTION:

You have 45 minutes to spend as you choose.

MR, SCHULTZ:

With your permj.ss.lon, I'll discuss the

statute and then address standing before I reach the merits.
In fact

and this is a pc-infc I would like to stress

in my discussion of the statute

the Price-Anderson Act is

a unique action by Congress which severely and arbitrarily
limits recovery available to victims of a nuclear accident.
Rather than involving a regulation of a business, such as Duke

29

Power Company, the Pric e-Anders on Act creates a situation which
could deprive persons of their homes and cause them serious
health injuries,, while simultaneously precluding them from
resorting to their state law remedies.
The thrust of the Act is two-fold.

First, it creates

a pot of money, $560 million, to cover damages arising out of a
nuclear accident.

Second, it limits all liability of all pos­

sible responsible parties to that pot cf money.
To explain how the statute operates -- and this Is
important to the ultimate fairness and adequacy of the remedy
I would like to use an example of a hypothetical victim, and
look at the statute and ask the question -- two questions:
How much would that victim receive in the event of an accident,
and what are the chances that that hypothetical victim would
be compensated?
So, for the purposes of the example, I'll assume that
the victim sustains $1,000 in property damage or personal injury.
First, let's look at how much money the victim would recover.
If the accident causes $560 million in damages or less, then
the victim would recover $1,000.

This is an example of an

accident where the limitation on liability would not come into
play.

And if all accidents were under $560 million, the limi­

tation on liability would not be necessary.

In fact, this case

would not be necessary.
However, for a major accident, one exceeding $560

30

million* the victim’s share becomes proportionately smaller,
so that in the event of an accident causing $1 billion in
damage, his share is half, or $500,

If the accident causes

$60 billion in damage, then his share would be $10, or less than
1% recovery for the damages incurred.

QUESTION:

What’s your view, on the question the

Solicitor General addressed, if the Government had maintained
its own monopoly and had not licensed these plants but had
itself built all of these plants?

Ccu3.d it have excluded all

liability as a modification of the Federal Tort Claims Act?
MR. SCHULTZ:

In that situation, in the event of an

accident, there would be a taking.

Now, no one could force the

Government to actually pay the money, but there would, in our
view, be a taking without just compensation and the Constitution
would place the same obligation on the Federal Government.
QUESTION:

What about great disasters that occurred

before the Federal Tort Claims Act, when sovereign immunity was
absolute?
MR, SCHULTZ:

Your Honor, it's true that even under

the Taking Clause
QUESTION:

Was anyone allowed to make a case on the

taking concept before the Federal Tort Claims Act, for injury
of the kind we are talking about?
MR. SCHULTZ:
case.

I don't know that anyone did make that

I am aware of no cases which say that they v?era

prohibited.
QUESTION:

Kansas City Disaster case where the Government

was claimed to be liable for millions and millions of dollars
in damages.

The majority of the Court held that it was within

the discretionary exception*the Government was not liable for
anything; didn't it?
MR* SCHULTZ:

Yes, under the Federal Tort Claims Act,

but it denied the --but the decision wae silent on the taking
issue.
QUESTION:

And when the suits were brought against

the United States for negligence arising out of the Kansas City
flood disaster* of something like $1 billion* back in the late
*4Cs or early !50s, no recovery was allowed.
MR. SCHULTZ:

Mr. Chief Justice. I am not familiar

with the facts of that case.
QUESTION:

The claim was the Government, the weather

bureau* was negligent in predicting the rainfall and the en­
gineers were negligent in not predicting the flood level,
MR. SCHULTZ:

The argument for taking here would be

much stronger than it would in that case, because here it is
not simply a matter of Government negligence.

It is a matter

of Government premotion, regulation and licensing of nuclear
power.

And the most important difference is the limitation of

liability In the Price-Anderson Act.
QUESTION:

On your theory of taking, when the Kansas

32

City floods came.» they took* In a sense -- In quotation marks
— they took hundreds of thousands of acres of land that were
under cultivation and destroyed all the crops and destroyed all
kinds of plants and homes.

Is that basically a different --

The Solicitor General said the atomic genie was let out of the
bottle.

Here it was the Mississippi River and its tributaries

that were let cut of the bottle* as it were* allegedly by the
Government's negligence,
MR« SCHULTZ:

In our taking argument* and assuming

that the Government were building and operating nuclear power
plants or looking at this case, we are not arguing that simply
because the Government is a factor in damage that it is a taking
every time.

But in the situation where the Government passes

the limitation on liability in the Price-Anderson Act which was
a precondition to nuclear power* then there the Government in­
volvement Is much more substantial.
Mr. Chief Justice* I would submit it is not dissimilar
from two cases which we cite In our brief.

The first of these

is Richards v, Washington Terminal Company.

There the Govern­

ment passed a statute authorizing a railroad company to build a
railroad through the City of Washington,

And the statute also

had the effect of nullifying the State or the District of
Columbia nuisance'laws* of protecting the railroad from those
actions.

So that* in that case then* the railroad built the

railroad* it built a tunnel.

Mr. Richards was a nearby

33
property owner.

He was unhappy because the soot and smoke from

the railroad tunnel earns onto his property and depreciated its
value.

The Court held that there was a taking there.

In other

words* even though Congress did not actually build the railroad,
just as Congress does not build the nuclear power plant, what it
did in authorizing the railroad, and most Important, In Immuniz­
ing the railroad company from nuisance action, is precisely
analogous, I submit, to what has happened here, where the
Government has immunized Duke Power Company from nuisance action,
or from any action, by persons injured: from a nuclear accident.
I would submit that Griggs v. Allegheny County is also
similar.

There the Court held there to be a taking when a private

airplane was flying and caused damage from noise to private
property.

And the Court held there to be a taking because the

airport was owned by the county and the county’s Involvement In
building the airport and marking the routes for the airline was
sufficient Government involvement for their to be a taking,
If.I may, I would like to return to my example of the
hypothetical victim and I want to look at what the recovery would
be to a victim in the event of an accident.
I had just described an extremely minimal recovery in
the case of a $60 billion accident.

While $60 billion may sound

like an incredibly high figure, it Is not unrealistic In light of
the most recent Government study on the subject.
Eind It has been referred to previously

That study --

34
QUESTION*.

Isn't that more than Duke Power has?

MR. SCHULTZ:
QUESTION:

Yes* it's more than Duke Poiver has.

And that's who you would have if you just

had — nobody else —» it would just be Duke Power?
MR. SCHULTZ:

Mr, Justice Marshall* If we did not have

limitation of liability* we would not have nuclear power,

So

if we. didn't have the limitation* we couldn't have these ac­
cidents.

And while $60 billion is more than Duke Power has

$560 million is very close to what Duke Power has.

And* the

point is* If we are as well under the Act* I submit that in the
event of an accident* victims could sue not only Duke, but they
could sue the manufacturer of the reactor* which in this case
is Westinghouse and in all cases is a corporation with billions
of dollars In assets.
QUESTION:

They could sue us* too.

QUESTION:

Assume our coal mines run out and the oil

wells run dry and the only major source of energy is atomic
power.

Assume further that we can't have atomic power plants

without limitation of liability statute.

Would you still say

the Congress does not have the power to pass such a statute and
make that source of power available?
MR. SCHULTZ:
QUESTION:

It would be a more difficult case.

Why?

MR, SCHULTZ:

I don't think we have to make the

assumption that the limitation on liability is necessary.

35
QUESTION:

You just told us it was ,

MR. SCHULTZ:

It is necessary for nuclear power, but

It’s not the only alternative for promoting nuclear power.
QUESTION:

What other alternative is there?

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

I was just going to say I

think your answer is inconsistent to Justice Stevens' question,
isn't it?

You say it's necessary to have this in order to

promote nuclear power and yet you say it is not the only al­
ternative.
MR. SCHULTZ:

If I said it that way, I wasn't as

precise as I might have been.

The limitation on liability --

and this you can see in the briefs of the industry in this case
and the Government's briefs and the District Court's findings
-- the limitation in 1957 was a precondition to nuclear power.
And some system today would be necessary, seme system to pro­
tect these companies from this potentially huge liability and
would be necessary in order to have additional nuclear power
plants built.

But the system did not have to be the system in

the Prlce-Anderson Act.
QUESTION:

May I ask this question.

Suppose the

Government assumed total responsibility for all damage, would
you still object?
MR, SCHULTZ:
QUESTION:

No.

We would concede that —

But you have* from the outsat of these

MR, SCHULTZ:

It is true my clients are opposed to

nuclear power and they are opposed to the P r ic e -A nd e rs on Act,
QUESTION:

But they are opposed to both.

MR, SCHULTZ:
QUESTION:

They are opposed to both.

And they oppose the initial licensing in

this case.
MR. SCHULTZ:
QUESTION:

Yes* that's correct.

So your basic objective is to stop the

operation of this plant,
MR. SCHULTZ:
QUESTION:

No.

What is it?

MR, SCHULTZ:

Our basic objective is to get a system

where our clients would receive full compensation in the event
of a nuclear accident.
And* in response to Mr. Justice Stevens 1 question.
I think your question is a response to that question.

One

alternative system would be for the Government to assume this
liability and that would not be -- Well* another alternative
would be to have a system which spreads it among the industry*
so that each company which owns reactors would be required to
pay $50 or $100 million to the victims of a disaster of this
nature.

37
QUESTION;

Suppose for the moment that the Government

tries:! to solve this problem by taking over all of the plants
which they have licensed and paying just compensation* so that
all the plants were being operated* owned by the United States
Government as a monopoly.

constitutionality of that?

MR. cCHULTZ:

There would be no problem about the

submit* that the victims of such an accident could sue the
government for just compensation.
QUESTION:

damage.

They could alw?ays sue for their property

We are not arguing that they could sue for anything

other than their property damage.

But in that situation

victims who incurred property damage could sue the Government

•38
for just property damage.
QUESTION:

Well, in the limitation that I have placed

in my hypothetical question of no liability on the Government,
on what basis -MR. SCHULTZ:

If the Government specifically pro­

vided that it would not pay, I am not certain that there is
anything victims could do to make the Government actually pay
out the money.

But, nevertheless, I would submit that they

would have a constitutional claim.
For example, if the Government specifically withdrew
the Tucker Act remedy, for these individuals or any individuals;,
then there would be no recourse that they would have.
QUESTION:

It would follow if they could eliminate

all liability then they can define the liability and put limits
on it.

Is that not so?
MR. SCHULTZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think that
t

is so.

I think the interest of federalism and the prior cases

of this Court require that if the Government chooses to withdraw
State tort remedies, the Federal Government chooses to withdraw
a State tort remedy, and particularly when it is simultaneously
encouraging the activity which would cause the damage, that it
is required, under the Due Process Clause, to provide some
ad equa t e rerned y.
In the Workmen's Compensation cases, that this Court
went through the analysis, it looked at the legislative

39
judgment and it determined that there was an adequate remedy,
Her^ Congress did not even pretend to make a legislative judg­
ment.

Senator Anderson* for whom the bill is named, claimed

authorship of the $560 million figure which limits all liability.
And he testified in 1957 that he literally picked that figure
out of the air.

In his words, he chose it as a figure that

"would not scare the country to death.'

Representative Holifield,

also a charter member of the Atomic Energy Committee, testified
in 1975 that he recognized, and everyone recognized, that the
figure of $560 million is an arbitrary figure.
So there Is no legislative judgment here that $560
million would be adequate in the event of an accident.

One

alternative to Congress would be to make that legislative
judgment and adequately provide in arty number of ways for the.
victims of such an accident.
QUESTION:

Well, do you think there is the same

inadequacy in legislative judgments in^State Workmen :s
Compensation Acts where you have $60 a week for the loss of
three fingers for the rest of your life, and that sort of
thing?

Do you think that necessarily represents a very par­

ticular determination that's just what the less of three
fingers is worth?
MR* SCHULTZ:

I think it represents a rough determina­

tion, and the sch@dul<@s for Workmen's Compensation increase as
the severity of th® injury increases.

I think it does represent.

40

a rough judgment.

The legislature makes that judgment.

And

in the cases of this Court even when the Legislature has made a
judgment -«■ vjhich L submit it did not make here -- the Court has
looked at that judgment to see if there is a fair exchange, to
see if the remedy provided is adequate.
QUESTION:

Here --

Well, I take it your position -- You are

probably too young to remember, but in the late '30s and early
"408 a number of States had actions for alienation of affections,
breach of promise of marriage, seductions, and a number of State
legislatures simply repealed those actions by legislative
activity.

They were being abused.
Is it your position that they would have to provide

an alternative remedy?
MR. SCHULTZ:
QUESTION:

No.

Why is that case different from this?

MR* SCHULTZ:

In those cases and in the case of

almost every tort statute that the legislature passes, it is
looking at the law and adjusting the remedies with the eye to
providing a fair system of compensation for the victims of the
remedy and a fair way of distributing the loss.
I submit that is what wa,s determined there.

The

legislature determined that the remedy was being abused and
it was just too inefficient to provide this remedy.
QUESTION:

But here --

What If a State decides tomorrow that an

action- for libel- ju&fc- threatens First Amendment' intereat® ©o

41
much that we are not going to allow our libel action in the
State any more.
Is that constitutional, or not?
MR0 SCHULTZ:
QUESTION:

Yes.

How does it differ from this case?

MR. SCHULTZ:

Because «- Well, I guess the primary

difference is that, regardless of what the legislature does,
you are going to have libel and you are going to have injuries
caused by negligence, and so. on.

But here, the legislative

action was a necessary precondition to the injuries.

Here,

without any legislative action, you could have no injuries
frcm a nuclear power plant.
QUESTION:

What if a newspaper went to the legis­

lature and said, "Unless you abolish libel laws, we won't be
able to publish any more. We are getting stuck with so many
1 lb el j ud grnen ts. "
Would that change your answer to the question about
a .State abolition of libel?
MRa SCHULTZ:

The point I am trying to make is that

the libel law, either way, has very little effect on what
people say and, thus, it has very little effect on the injuries.
Just as I think a law making it Illegal to commit an assault,
if anything, deters assaults.

But none of those laws, none of

those legislative actions actually encourage assault or en­
courage libel.

42

QUESTION:

Well, if a bunch of newspapers in a State

all, in fact, went out of business, I think there probably would
be a lot fewer libels, wouldn’t there?
QUESTION:

Mr, Schultz, doesn’t the existence of a

libel remedy exercise some kind of deterrent effect on news­
papers and what they say?
MR. SCHULTZ;

I would think it does, and the point I

am trying to make is in most cases the existence of these
remedies has a deterrent effect.

Here, the legislative action

had just the opposite effect.
QUESTION:

The same thing.

You repeal the libel

law and you give the newspapers carte blanche to say what it
wants to and to say a lot more reckless and injurious things.
It’s quite clear.

Here, you repeal the damage limitation.

You

build some atomic plants and one fails and somebody's going to
get hurt.

Same thing.
QUESTION:

At least I don't see the difference.

Do you see any parallel with the efforts

of some State legislatures to enact statutes that make absol­
ute, but limited, liability for all personal Injuries, applying
In general, the Workmen's Compensation principle to all auto­
mobile injuries?
MR. SCHULTZ:

Those actions I. see as being parallel

to the Workmen's Compensation statute.
QUESTION:
not?

Some of them limit the liability, do they

43
MR. SCHULTZ:
QUESTION:

Yes, they do.

And much below the verdicts which are

currently being rendered by juries in common lav; actions.
MR. SCHULTZ:

Yes, they do.

But the ones that I am

familiar with provide for recovery -- the limits are $500,000,
$200,000, but the point is -QUESTION:

There is a limit?

MR. SCHULTZ:

There is a limit, and we are not arguing

that any limit would be unconstitutional.

But the point is that

in those cases the recovery provided is substantial.

It is not

dependent on the total injuries to all victims of the accident,
as it is here.

Moreover, in every other case, and this includes

-- I believe it would include certain libel injuries also —
victims can purchase insurance to protect themselves.
QUESTION:

Let me follow through on that.,

There has

been a let of talk about limitation by statute on medical mal­
practice liability.

Constitutional?

MR, SCHULTZ:
tutional.

The statutes I have seen are consti­

A limit to zero,which I submit is not far from what

happened here, would raise serious questions.
QUESTION:

Even there --

Where do you get off that slippery slope

between half million dollars and zero?
MR. SCHULTZ:

Well, here I think that at a minimum

the legislature is required to make a judgment that the money
provided is substantial.

Moreover, in the medical malpractice

analogy* at least the victims have the option of buying insur­
ance,

At least it is a consensual relationship.
QUESTION:

Nall* there are limitations on the avail­

ability of insurance.

But to patients* there is

no limitation on the availability of insurance to patients.

MR, SCHULTZ:

not.
QUESTION:

Why not?

MR. SCHULTZ:

Because every home Insurance policy,

contains an exclusion* excluding radiation caused by a nuclear
accident,
QUESTION:

done to prevent than from taking out insurance.
MR, SCHULTZ:

Yes.

of providing fche $560 million in insurance requiras the utili­
ties to purchase the maximum insurance available.

And the in­

surance industry has given that as its reason why it is un­
willing to sell Insurance to homeowners or any property owner,
QUESTION:

Mr. Schultz* let me try another one.

Suppose North Carolina passed a law that said that
in its State courts in any major catastrophe no person could be
subject to more than $560 million in damages.
MR, SCHULTZ:

The question is would that be con­

stitutional?
QUESTION:

Would there be anything wrong with it?

MR. SCHULTZ:
QUESTION:

No* total,

MR. SCHULTZ:
QUESTION:

No single person?

The total damages --

In any single catastrophe.

MR. SCHULTZ:

If that statute did not have the pre­

cise purpose and effect of promoting nuclear power or catas­
trophe that could cause damages many times the limitation*
then I think it probably would be constitutional.
QUESTION:

Well* take the next step.

But here

Could the

Federal Government say* "Dear State of North Carolina* we will
pick that tab up*" the $560 million tab?
MR. SCHULTZ:

It depends on whether the purpose and

effect of the legislation is to promote an activity which* as
is recognized* can cause injuries many times in excess of that

46
figure.

If ifc doesn't promote such an activity# then you have

a completely different case from this case
QUESTION:

You have what X!ve told you.

That's all

you have.
Okay# if North Carolina passed this bill in 1910#
would that be okay?
MR. SCHULTZ:

North Carolina said in 1910 that no single

catastrophe should subject anybody to more than $5^0 million
worth of damages.

Would that be okay?

said we'll pick: up the tab.

And Congress in 1911

QUESTION:

You take something that costs $560 million#

you take it?
MR. SCHULTZ:

I apologize.

You wouldn't -- As long

as the Federal Government — I think you have to look at the
facts of each case and look to see how involved the Government's
role is in the accident.

And it is simply difficult to answer

the question without knowing whether the Government's role is
critical to the in juries to the victims of the accident.
To keep my commitment to Mr. Justice Rehnqulst. I
suppose I'd better address rightness and standing.

That individual would show some small

standing is a question of whether you've shown some injury*
and it can be very small.
QUESTION:

You say that anything that constitutionally

is a case of controversy.

MR. SCHULTZ:

The Court would have the power, yes.

But I am not suggesting that the Court should decide that
question in that case.
They feel the prudential considerations strongly
militate toward reaching the merits, as the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission has stated in its brief.

The primary prudential

consideration here is that the worst time for a reasoned
decision on the constitutionality of the Price-Anderson Act
would be after a nuclear accident.

Well, this is just an idea

Typically, you will find parties

to decide it,

would not actually incur that cancer for 10 to 40 years after

QUESTION:

No, but there is a greater likelihood.

MR. SCHULTZ:

But here if the Court invalidates the

limitation, the likelihood is that Congress will ask further
legislation to provide substantial recovery for the victims.

it stands, the Plaintiffs will know where they stand —

QUESTION:
tion on liability?

Now* isn't there another realistic limita­
Let me give you this hypothetical.

However many millions of dollars are invested into an
atonic energy plant -- and many millions and millions would be
— and then let 's assume these dire predictions that have been
mentioned occur and the terribly tragic results which would be
a series of rings would produce liability far beyond the total
assets of a particular corporatiori.
MR, SCHULTZ:
QUESTION:

Isn't that highly probable?

Yes* of the particular owner.

Isn't there an economic limit on the

liability already that you can't get any more money out of
that plant than it has* and if their plant has been destroyed
by the damage in the process* what chance has any claimant got
of getting full recovery?
MR, SCHULTZ:

The claimant would have two protections.

The first would be the State tort laws would have deterred the
construction of the nuclear power plant* so that without this
limitation on liability the State -QUESTION:

My hypothetical was that you had a very

daring enterpriser who had a lot of money -- a Howard Hughes
type — and so he said he didn't care so he put in $1 billion
to build the plant* but the plant did damage that caused $3
billion vjorth of injury.
MR, SCHULTZ:

With the understanding that that part

of the hypothetical is Inconsistent with the facts of this case—

53
QUESTION:

It isn't inconsistent with reality* is it*

that the damage coming from this hypothetical plant could vastly
exceed the claims?
MR, SCHULTZ:

No* no* but the judge below and Congress

found that the limitation on liability was a necessary pre­
condition.

This is very clear from the legislative history.

For example* the vice president of General Electric* ivhich is
one of the two major manufacturers of nuclear reactors* came to
Congress in 1957 and testified that even though his company was
in the middle of constructing the first reactor, that unless
Congress acted to limit the liability his company would simply
walk away from the project and not make the investment.

But* Mr<, Chief Justice* the second part of the
answer is that the victim could sue the manufacturer of the
reactor which is Westinghouse here* which is a company that
would have suffered no loss and would have billions of dollars
in assets.
The Pric e-Anders on Act takes away not only the
victim's right to sue Duke* but also the right to sue the
manufacturer or any other responsible party.

Moreover* I

think it is important to point out bb&t under the PriceAnderson Act it may be as much as 20 years before these
victims would receive any recovery.

And this is because the

Act requires that before any compensation beyond a small amount
of emergency funds may be paid out a district court judge must

54
come up with a plan of distribution to provide for the late
claimants — these are the health injuries

that would not

appear for 10 or 20 years after the accident»

And if you

don't know what the Injuries are going to be it may simply be
impossible to pay the early claimants until you knew what the
injuries of all the claimants are.
I think* Mr. Chief Justice* that the point you made
earlier in the argument is critical.

And that is if Congress

had the power to promote nuclear power by limiting liability to
$560 million then that argument would 3ead to the proposition
that it would have had the power to limit the liability to
sero dollars.

In fact* it would lead to the proposition that

the Federal Congress could eliminate all State law remedies for
torts .
QUESTION:

Mr. Schultz* on that very question* the

corporate device itself is a method of limiting liability that
promotes capital Investment and the like.

Supposing we held

the statute unconstitutional and Congress passed a new statute
and said that the power company convey the plant .s-aets into
a separate corporation whose liabilities shall be limited
to its ov.n assets and there shall be no piercing of corporate
veil or anything like that.

Would that be unconstitutional?

The corporation shall not be liable for anything over and above
its own net worth,
MR, SCHULTZ:

That would be precisely the same as the

55
effect of the Pric e-Anders on Act,
QUESTION:

It would be unconstitutional for Congress

to peas a statute that a corporation's liability Is limited to
its net worth?
MR. SCHULTZ:
QUESTION:

And say -- no —

If It is engaged in hazardous occupation

and enterprise,
MR. SCHULTZ:

But to say that the nuclear Industry

may convey «•- to encourage them to convey their reactors to
corporations so that they can escape liability, and to dc that
so that —
QUESTION:

They can limit liability, just like every

other corporation does.

New York Central has a lot of people

it has hurt and it is not going to be able to pay them 100
cents on the dollar,
MR, SCHULTZ:

No, but I submit that the remedy

provided by the corporate limitation statute, if you look at
it as a vjhole, is a substantial remedy.

In most cases,

vie thus are able —
QUESTION:

Well, $560 million times the number of

nuclear plants is a lot of money too.

I take it is is per

incident, isn't it, not just $560 nationwide?
MR. SCHULTZ:
QUESTION:
MR. SCHULTZ:

Yes.

Per plant?
If there were three accidents, it is

56
unclear what would happen., but for the first two, anyway* in a
year, it is per incident,
But if you look at the corporate remedy, as a whole,
and look at its fairness, not to just a particular individual
but to a group of vifctims that would be Injured, that could be
injured by the corporation, most of those victims are going to
be able to recover.

If the corporation is specifically organ­

ized for the purpose of avoiding liability, they have the
option of piercing the corporate veil.

And because of that

and I think this brings us back around — because of that the
nuclear industry here -» the nuclear industry here on its own
could do this — it could simply incorporate each nuclear
reactor and '.Limit its liability that way.
QUESTION:

That’s the economic limit that I was

suggesting to you before.
MR, SCHULTZ:

But it’s not willing to take the risk.

This comes back around to the fact that the Federal action
here, the limitation on liability, is absolutely necessary for
fchs construction of these nuclear reactors.

Even though the

particular system chosen here isn't necessary, there are other
ways that the Federal Government could do this and substanti­
ally provide for State citizens* the fact remains that the
limitation here is necessary for the construction.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER,:
now, Mr. Schultz,

Your time has expired

57
MR, SCHULTZ:

Thank you.

Do you have anything further on this 3ide of the
table?
You have two minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OP STEVE C. GRIFFITH, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GRIFFITH:

It simply boils down, as Plaintiffs

suggest in their argument^that there were alternatives available
to Congress which Congress considered, such as writing a blank
check on the Treasury of the United States, but Congress de­
cided that that was not in the public interest.

It did have

the power to limit the amount available for a creditable ac­
cident, one that they thought might have a chance of occurring,
but for the uncreditable accident Congress did not feel that it
had to go that far to cover that eventuality.

Arid there is

where Congress promised to act in the evert -- although
extremely unlikely -- that it would then consider the matter
in an after the fact situation.
Similar, in fact, I think, where Plaintiffs admit
that the Act would be constitutional if the Tucker Act remedies
were available.

The Tucker Act remedies for injuries more than

$100,000 require a congressional appropriation, after the fact,
which is, we think, the imaginative way, the realistic way, the
way in the public interest that Congress acted in a rational
.manner.

53
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 2:10 o'clock, p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
