Mr. Abercrombie, 1 think you may proc®®d when you’re
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN B. ABERCROMBIE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ABERCROMBIE:

Mr. Chief Justice sad may it

pleas® Mi® Court:

This case arose' out of a refusal of Eastex to allow
distributio» of & union circular on its plant premises.
circular is found ©a pages 2 and 3 ©£ the Appendix.

Th®

Th®

refusal was because s@cti.oas 2 and 3 of th® circular were
considered to hava a© relevance to any matter concerning
Petitioner's employees as employees and was political in nature.
Petitioner had no objection to Sections 1 and 4 of the circular.
Section 2 of th© circular consisted of a polemic
against Inclusion by & Texas Constitutional Convention of a
B right to work" provision in a proposed revised Constitution*
Section 3 contained criticisms of then President
V

Nixon'i?- veto of a minimum wag® bill, comments about oil.
\

industry profits, and requested employees to register to vote*
Over one-half of s©oft£©h 3 was concerned with oil Industry
f

.

•

prof! tei»
Sections 2 and 3 of Mi© circular mad© up the bulk.

4
There was a© ©vidence in this case that Petitioner
had ta&en & stand, @£thar pro oz con, with relation to any
matter discussed in Section® 2 or 3.

The record is clear that

the union had previously publicized its political massages
by mail and with lists furnished by Easts», «and that its only
reason for requesting in-plant distribution of this circular
was increased mailing costs*

There is no evidence that distri­

bution off the plants premises was impractical*
Th@ Administrative Law Judge decided the cas© solely
on Section 7 grounds, no consideration of Easte&’s property
rights was mad®,
Th® Board, pro forma, affirmed*

Th® Fifth Circuit

originally granted enforcement under Section 7 and th® First
Amendment and adopted the holding that th© union could distri**
but® whatever is reasonably related to the employees* jabs or
status ox condition, as employees, to the full range permitted
by Section 7*s language, valid, local laws, and th® First

Amendment*
On motion fear rehearing, the Court excised its First
Amendment references, but denied rehearing*
The basic issue before the Court today is whether
the mutual &id or protection language of Section 7 of th© Act
protects a distribution on an employer's premises, which is
political in nature and is not significantly related to the
employe©®* immediate employment relationship*

5
That Issu® divides into two parts whether the mutual

aid or protection language of Section 7 protecte political
expression, and if it is found that it does, does the natur®
and strength ©£ such a right mandate or warrant the interference
with the employer's property rights, which is inherent in as
in-plant distribution?
QUESTION:

Isn’t there a sub-question there, Mr»

Abercrombie, even assuming that both of the last two — both
©£ your questions are answered in favor ©f fh© Board, as to
whether the principi® of Republic Aviation should b© applied
the same way to strictly political literature as to organisa­
tional literatus?©?
MR, ABERCROMBIE:

Mr, Justice Rehnquist, w© believe

that that is part of ‘She basic question, of whether the mutual
aid of protection language of Section 7 protects political
expression.

But to the extent that Republic Aviation states

that there is & right t© in-plant distribution, that case is,
of course, limited by its terms to in-plant distribution by
employees relating to organ!rational effort.
QUESTION!

But that was an upholding by this Court

of the Boardis finding teat this particular type of rule was
reasoaabl© with respect to organizational materiali
MR, ABERCROMBIE:

Yes, sir.

QUESTIONs And my question to you is*;

Even though on©

were to conclude that the sort of literature that was sought to

6
bo distributed hero was covered under Section 7, and even
though the Board were permitted to conclude under the Act that
s©m© distribution was permissible on the employer's property,
■would it necessarily be entitled to simply us© the Republic
Aviation formula without any re-weighing of factors?
MRc ABERCROMBIE;

No, sir, And that is ssxsctly what

th® Board and th® Fifth Circuit did in this case, was to us©
the presumptive invalidity of th© refusal of distribution,
tli® presumptive rule ©£ right to distribute on an employer's
property, growing out ©£ Repub Iia Aviation, was of course bas&id

on th® organisational efforts ©f employees under th® fundamental
provision, or the fundamental rights of Section 7,
We are asking the Court to declare that political
activity on an employer's premises is unprotected,

otherwise,

the possible consequences ©f allowing uniens —
QUESTION; Well, put that way, you aren’t, necessarily
arguing that it's unprotected, you're just saying you can't d©
it on an employer's premises,
MR, ABERCROMBIE;
QUESTION;

Or are you arguing both ©f them?

MR, ABERCROMBIE;
QUESTIONs

W© a.VO —

I'm arguing both ©£ them,

Even if it's protected, you can't do it

on th© employer's premises and it isn't protected in the first
placa, .-5s that it?
MRo ABERCROMBIE:

Mr, Justice Whit®, it lu our post-

7
tioa that it is unprotected.

It is our further position that

it is unprotected ©a the employer's premises, m a separata,
and distinct issue.
QUESTION:

Yes, Wes 11, i just — 1 suppose you can say

a lot of things axe protected, but you just can't do them smo

placas*
MR, ABERCROMBIE:
QUESTION:

That’s right, sir.

Fr@©dom ©£ speech, there's & time and place

for it sometimes.
MR* ABERCROMBIE:
QUESTION:

That’s right, sir.

You wouldn’t challenge the right to

circularis® this outside the company- gates, on the public side­
walk, would you?
MR. ABERCROMBIE:
QUESTION:

On th© public sidewalk?

MR* ABERCROMBIE:
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

Mr. Chief Justice, I would —

I’m speaking now of employees leaving work,

going home at night, after hours.
MR. ABERCROMBIE:
bo

X would cfe&llgm® th® right t© do

under the provisions of Section 7 of the National Labor

x
Relations Act.
QUESTION: Well, does Section 7 have anything to do

with it if it’s out in a public place?
MR* ABERCROMBIE:

S@otd©3a 7 establishes the rights of

employees? in dealing with their omployer.

It de@s not establish

8
fee rights of employees as citizens to engage in off-plant,
political activities®
QUESTIONs

That's why I asked you whether S@ct.loa 7

has anything to do 'wife what they d© oat on
MR® ABERCROMBIES
QUESTION s

fee

public highway®

No, sir.

So they could hand th® leaflets out oa

fe@ sidewalk * as fee employees cam® out of fee plant?
MR® ABERCROMBIEs

Y®s, sir, but you asked me, not

in th© context of a union organization, but just whether it
had anything to do wife employees handing out political litera­
ture. It doesn't.

It defines only certain rights within fee

@raploy©r»«mploy®@ relationship®
It is our position feat nothing in th® Act prevents
on employer from discharging or refusing to hire an employee
because of his political beliefs or actions as a citizen, not
as an employee.
QUESTION?

Mr® Abercrombie, following up an Jus tic®

Rehaquist's question, I don't understand you to contend feat
fe© right to distribute literature is limited to organisational
literature.
MR® ABERCROMBIEs

No, sir, I ©ra not so contending®

I am contending feat th© right to distribute literature inplant is limited to literature feat is related to th© funda­
mental employee rights to organisation, collective bargaining,
to join and assist labor organizations? feat it doefs not extend

9
to the distribution of political literature.
QUESTIONS

ion do concedo, don't you, that if this

pamphlet had Included nothing but I tains 1 and 4, it would have

been protected?
MR. ABERCROMBIE:

Yes, sir, it would hav© b@€8&.
*

QUESTION: And 4 is what, just the general exhortation
in favor of unions, isn't it?
MR* ABERCROMBIE s
QUESTION:

I beg y®ur pardon?

Item 4 is just sort of a general exhortar

felon that unions are fin© organisations? isn’t it?
MR. ABERCROMBIE:

Y©s, sir, it is.

QUESTION: And that sort of general exhortation, you
say is protected.

Well, why aren’t 2 and 3 in the asm®

general category?
MR. ABERCROMBIE:

Tfcay are net* 4 is at least

relating to, or could b® considered as union institutional
literature not- related to the

question of political beliefs.
x

Bear in mind w© are talking,in Sections 2 and 3,
about political matters, and that was the issu© there, Mr.
Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

Mr, Ab@rcrop.ibi©, suppos® they urged fch&m

to vote for minimum wage? that’s political?
MR. ABERCROMBIE:

Mr. Justice* Marshall, It is my vi m

that teat £a unprotected for distribution on tee employer's

10

That, is essentially the case before us today»
Before this Court today®
1 said that the purpose of — or what th® Board end
the Court have done, would fo© t© politicis® th® work placa» on
issues or candidates it supports ©r objects'to®

Th® Board

admits <ms ranch &n pages 34 of its brief®
We believe that this Court should draw th® same
sharp distinction between political activity and traditional
and fundamental union representation activity, that, it draw in
International association of Jjaghlnists vs® street, and, more
recently, in jffiood vs® Detroit Beardja^Bduoatica, certainly
in a different context®
This Court recognised,in Street and Abood» th@
separation between .a union's pursuit of its traditional role
as a collective bargaining representative and its ancillary
rol© m & political, social and fraternal organisation®
W® would also state the Court that this — that it isclear feat Section 7 is not ce-extaneive with the First
Amendment, as the Board ©ad th© Court below impliedly assert®
Nor '-is th© employer’s plant a public park or a marketplace of
ideas ®
QUESTION %

N©r is £h@ employer

Congress- of tbs

United States, I take it®
MR® ABERCROMBIE:
QUESTION;

I beg your pardon?

I said, nor is th© employer the Congress

IX
of the ..United States, so as to be 'forbidden from abridging
freedom of speach.
MRo ABKRCROMBIBs

No, sir.

This is not a First

Amendment' freedom of spesach css®? this is a Section 7 case,
but we would submit that fh© Board and th© Court below have
impliedly made it. a First Amendment case* by th© assertion that
th® Board makes in its brief that th© employer has no right to
prevent distribution of union literature, so long as it does

not disrupt production or discipline and contains material
relating to any union objective, is a First Amendment argument?
no prior restraint except in case of clear present danger or

disruption.

' ‘

Another fault ©f th© Board sad the Court below in
this case is the assertion and th® finding that the term
"©mploy©®" us©& in Section 7 of th© Act, encompasses th© generic
employe© as a worker of the world.

And that petitioner's

employees are protected under Section 7 in rendering "mutual
aid or protection to such workers as a broad class".

This is

also inherent in th© Court's rationality.
Certainly the language of Section 2(3) of th® Act
defining "employes" e^ebmpasses more than employees of a
particular employer/

But we submit that it is no broader than

the definition of "labor dispute"

.found in Section 2(9) ©£ the

Act, in that a union's right to distribute «a our premises or
to deal in relationship with employees a. workers, is no broader

12

than tii© definition of labor organization found in the provisions
©f Section 2(5) ©f th© Act.
We might add

to this Court fcfe&fc the Board itself

has found that political literature is not protected, where, in
the Ford Motor Company case, it stated8

"wholly political

propaganda not related to employees * problema and concern® sua
@mploy@es can, to® pr®hibit®d0ra
Th© Board and the Court below would distinguish the
particular political expression used on th© grounds that it was
reasonably related to th® employees' jobs or their status or
condition as employees in th® plant*
Apart from such rationality, the Court below would
apparently agree teat it was unprotected*

As our brief points

out, th© logical extension of such a rule would result in the
politicalization of th© work place*
But we have sis© pointad out th© Court’s finding
results from th© Court’s consideration ©£ the term "employee"
as used in Section 7 of til© Act in th© generic sens©, which is
overly broad and, w© submit, is in error.

And doss not take

into consideration the purposes and policies of the Act, t©
regulate th© relations between an employer and his employees,
©r th© limited intrusion on ak «empl©y®r's property rights
allowed by'this Court, place is of equal concern in defining
Section 7 rights a© is substance or actions taken.

It in only

by limiting the protections of the other mutual aid or pretao-

13
ties?i language of S©ction 7 to in-plent distributions which
concern, matters significantly connected to tit© employees'
relationship to their employer? th© policy of th© Act, the
conflieiss beteeen apposing right® and the practical operation
of employer~employe® relations o®n ba reconciled and harmonised.
This Court, has never said, and should not say here,
that any yielding of an employers' property rights is
necessary, except where an employer -*» except where they -are in
conflict with the fundamental right ©f self organisation,
representation and collective bargaining®
As this Court said in Central Hardware, and I quote,
"This principle requires & yielding ef property rights only
in the context of an organisational campaign? absent such a
yielding, there is a.® Section 7 right on an employer's property,w
Republic Aviation, referred to by Mr, Jus-tic®
Rehnquist, required a yielding only in th© poshur® 'that pro™
hibition of in-plant solicitation was an unreasonable impediment
to th© exercise of th© right to self organisation, and then only
on non-work feim© and in non-work anas.®
Babcock & Wilcox did not require such a yielding in
\
th® absence of a shewing of a special need? but again in an
organ!sing context»
Magnavox, cited by th© Board in its brief- was a
waiver case»

But fcs the exto&t that it; dealt with the problem,

it was concerned with fundamental Section 7 rights®

A key

foot&ote omitted in, te© Magn&vox quotation in th® Board’s brief
makes it clear that this Court has not extended Republic
Aviation as th© Board asserts.
That footnote states:

"To indicate consideration of

alternative means of communication is at least a part of the
range of any inquiry into th© need for in-plant solicitation,
if Section 7 sights are t© ba protected."
Republic» Babcock s. Wilcox» and Magnavox can b®
delineated as "who and where” cases in connection wife self
organisation.
This case» 'Shis Baatax case seeks to define what can
be distributed.
Section 7 does not exist in a vacuum.

Section 7

righto co-exist with ether competing interest®, and, as this
Court lias stated, tee exercise ©£ such right® must be balanced
against such competing interests to determine where theny fall
on th® spectrum.

Organirational activity is obviously an

overriding consideration under th® Act. But even then© it has
bean ci returns crihed.
Political expression is at the other ©ad ©f th®
spectrum, if it is protected at all.
QUESTION:

Suppose an employee ©f ©. particular

company, ©a his off time, helps picket another employer during
& strike, and he .gets fired for it?
MR. ABERCROMBIE:

That is protected activity —

MR, ABERCROMBIE: Well, sir, I'll give you a very
good

©sample of that. An employee on strike against his

employer has a right to picket that employer.

But he has no

right to do that, to exercise that fundamental Section 7 right,

What is the significance ©f th© •amploysr* s right to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. ALLEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MRo ALLENt

Mr* chief Justice, and may it pleas®

the Court:
QUESTION:

Will® you5r«j an that, before you get

started, do you disagree with that last proposition that th®
union can't carry six political messages and one union message
in ©si® pamphlet and b® protected by Section 7?

22
MR. ALLEN:

I agrea with that propositi or, Mr. Chi®f

Jus tic®, to th® extent that it — te the extent that th© union
is simply sticking in incidental Section 7 material i&
literature that is primarily & vehicle fer unrelated political
propaganda.

Tha Board, I think it» position is fairly dear,

would not contend that that was protected activity.

Tho

Board's position is th© alternative ground for affirming the
judgment in this case is limited to a situation where, at

MR. ALLEN:

And you don’t want, censorship.
That’s right, Mr. Justice Marshall»

In a cas© lik© this where the ©mployer is charged
with having restrained his employees from the exercise of fdielr
Section ^ rights, w© agree with petitioner that essentially
the analysis presents two issues.
®h® first issue is whether the activity of th©
employees was an activity that comes within the scop® ©£
Section 7.

If not, then tha cas® is over, and the employer

hasn’t committed any unfair labor practice by restraining the

activity»
If, however, ths activity is within the scope of
Section 7, a second issue is presented, namely whether the
©jap 1 oyer has shewn sore special management or property interest
that would justify son® restrictions by him on the manner in
which the Section 7 rights are exercised.
QUESTIONs
Mr. Allen?

Why do you phras® th® issue that way,

But: it;’® fully within the g©ss@ral and well-established

The principal issue in this cos© is th© first issue,»
whether the activity com®® within the seep© of Section 7.
That* e an issue tSiet gees beyond the particular facts of this

Section 7 does not cover ©r boar on

th© distribution ©f th®

Mr. Abercrombie has mad® that quite explicit today,
in, connection with Mr, Chief Justice's remarks.

It is clear,

Mr, Chi®f Justice, that Section 7 does apply to distributi©©,
of material off the premises, on the sidewalk.
If, for Instance, ‘this material was being distributed

How, petitioner contends teat the distribution of

that, tout's not a necessary requirement.

Well, ~
Is the union l®ad<arship, does it haw®

unr©viewable discretion to decide in this gray area what is
for the mutual protection and benefit of employees such as,

Because th© Board *»«»

34
MRe ALLEN:

No, the Board has the function not of

determining the merits ©f the environmental legislation, but
determining the scop© of Section 7.
QUESTION: Well, that’s the question, of course, in
this G&3©«
MRo ALLEN: And I’d like to emphasise in that connec­
tion* Mr» Justice Stewart, that# &&■ this Court has recognized
many times, th© Board’s determination or the question of
whether

of the scop© ©f Section 7 and how it applies to

particular fact situations, is a question that the Board’s
determination should, we believe, b© given a large measure of
latitude•

And the reason for that is that the field ©f labor"

management relations obviously involves an infinite variety of
situations.

And the Board has to deal with these situations

©very day, and it has to make distinctions that are sometimes
difficult but that are, nevertheless, necessary to make.
QUESTION:

Mr» Allan, all I find that the Board hs

said in this case is on 24a and 25a ©£ the Petition for
Certiorari, four paragraphs, simply a boilerplate affirmance
of tli© findings of the Administrative Law Judge.
I would fo© more persuaded by your argument if I could
find somewhere where 'the Board had reasoned the thing through

MR. ALLEN s Well, the decision of to© Administratis

discussion ultimately is not necessarily lodged in to© Board
but. in to© Administrative Law Judge?
MR. ALLEN:

Not at all, to© Board ha® power to revi w

and reverse to© Administrative Law Judge.
But with respect to your broader point that to© Board

has not articulated a reason, well, w® believe that to®
Administrative Law Judg@, whose opinion was incorporated by to®
Board, adopted by to® Board, mad© quits clear the reasons for
it.
But, la any event, toe Board has throughout the
administration of Section 7 articulated standards teat have
quito clearly indicated, and relied in this case on former
decisions that; have quite clearly indicated that activity ©£
this kind is activity *— that it’s activity that can bo, in

MR. ALLENs

Well, the one case w© cite in our brief

was a decision by the Board in th© Fore: Motor Cerap&ay case,
ci-fcgd in our brief at page 30, where the Board held that an
attempt by the union to distribute a newspaper, whim I believe
was a Socialist Workers Party newspaper, was not activity that

In a general election, let’s assume that

all that was distributed was a list of the candidates with
some biographical data» saying these are friends of labor.

QUESTION;

Just might be ©pen.

MR. ALLEN;

It might bo ©pen.

I don’t know how the

Board would decide it, and I would not blush at defending the
Board*© conclusion that that was protected by Section 7.
After all, the phrase "concerted activities for mutual aid and
protection* is, by its very terras, an extremely broad phase.
And the history of the Act indicates that it had a broad

intent.
And I think that perhaps Judga Learned Hand in the
Pater Cal Her Kohl&r case most eloquently explained the reason
for that.

He ©xpiaiasid that the very notion of mutual aid and

protection is the notion that when employe© A assists employe©
3 with respect to employee B®s problem, that serves both ©f
their mutual interests.

And the reason, as he stated, was that

I can’t find it directly? but. essentially that when A’s tern
comes, he knows that B is .going to help him. That’© the very

39
concept; ©f mutual aid and protection.

It is & concept that has

consistently not bean limited to what the Court of Appeals

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN B. ABERCROMBIE, E8Q. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ABERCROMBIE:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

pleas©

fsh© Courts
The Board's focus in this argument is wrong,

w®

ar©

not miking about Section 7 as a whole, w® are only talking
about non-fundamental right® under th© other mutual aid or
protection language of Section 7.
Th® suggested rule, which w© hav© advanced in ©ur
brief, has application only in this contexfe.

And I would

respond t© Mr. Justice Relinquish1 s question, there was a©
discussion in th© Administrative Law Judge*s ©pinion ©f
basis for his decision.

He simply cited th© presumption ©f

invalidity by the ~~ because of th® limited distribution or
th© limitation on distribution of this material on the
employer5 s premises•

C

The Board and th© Court below h&vo placed the cart
before th© hors® ©a the matter of accommodation of Section 7
property rights — Section 7 rights to property rights.

I not®

Mr. Allen's reference to our "naked property right”., we've

48
quite proud of that "naked property right" , sad believe that
w© have a right to ©afore© it undor th© Constitution and tha
laws ©f this country, except in those instanoss whore they
weuid amount to &a unrs&sonaJb 1© impediment to the organ!ssation
©f employees on th© employer's promises.
The Board would adept a presumption of right for
say Section 1 right, presumably including the right to picket
©a til© employer's promises, in th© absence ©f a showing by
th© employor of spool a! circumstances,
Certainly no balancing was undertaken in this case.
Th© presumption alluded to by the Board only relates to
distribution of fundamental — affecting fundamental S®cti©s 7
rights, particularly th® right to organise.
Thia Court has novor said that th© presumpti.on is
applicabis t© any union distribution, regardless ©£ its
content.

Th® distinction between what is distributable in a

plant is one of substance# in th® same sens®.as that issue was
addressed in Babcock & wlleas:»

There the Board mad® th@ same

assertion that it did her®, ttah Republic Aviation established
a presumption of the right. ©£ a non-employe® organizer to
enter th® employer's premiss® for the purposes of organizing.
Th© Court h©Id that there was no such presumption,
that only by ® showing ©f special need to do s© could a non**
\

employe® enter th® employer's premises.
W® suggest that those has bean no accommodation mad©

43
ia this cm&, but that because of the nature o'f th® literature
that is b®ing distributed? political ia nature? that the
accommodation must necessarily follow

©n th© right, of th©

employer to prohibit such distributi©», ia th© exercise of his
prop@ri§? rights? aid that? as a matter ef law? the distribution
©£ political material ©a th© employer's , premises is aid earnest
b® allowed under th® provisions of Section 7 of the National
Labor Relations het.
Thank y©u8
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Thank you? gentlemen.

Th® cas® is submitted.
[Whereupon? at 2s37 o’clock? p.m.? th® cases in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
