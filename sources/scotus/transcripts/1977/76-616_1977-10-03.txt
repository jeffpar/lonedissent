MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

next in No. 76-616, New York against Cathedral Academy.

Mrs. Coon, you 'may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. JEAN M. COON
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MRS. COON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In this appeal there is presented to this Court at
least a collateral if not a direct, descendent of this Court’s
decision in Levitt against Committee for Public Education &_
Religious Liberty, decided 1873.

In that case this Court held

invalid, under the First Amendment to the Constitution of the
United States, ~a New York statute enacted in 1970 which had
provided reimbursement to non-public schools for the cost of
certain state mandated record-keeping and testing services.

In

so doing, this Court affirmed a decision of the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York, which
had invalidated the statute on the basis that the tests-—
Q

What year was that?

MRS. COON:
q

And ours was nineteen—

MRS. COON:
Q

The District Court was 1972.

1973.

It was April, 1972, was it not, in the middle of

the school -/ear?

4
MRS. COON:
Q

Yes, it was.

During the school year.

MRS. COON; ■ It was during the school "'ear.

The

statute provided for annual payments in two installments, one
of which had been made for the 1971-72 school year, and the
other one had yet fco b® made; and, in fact, a preliminary
injunction was issued by the District Court, I believe about
two days prior to the earliest date on which that second
payment could have been made.
Q

These were really reimbursements, were they

not, for expense incurred?
\

MRS. COON:
Q

They war© intended to be reimbursements.

For expense already incurred?

MRS. COON;

Yes, Your Honor.

for a lump sum per pupil payment.

The statute provided

The record before this

Court at that time indicated that the amounts which were paid
to the schools were in fact generally less than the actual
costs of rendering the services involved.
Immediately succeeding the decision of the District
Court, which had enjoined permanently th® payment of the
stata aid which was provided by the statute and which of course
had th© effect of permanently preventing th© second payment
for th© 1971-72 school year, the New York State Legislature
enacted th© statute here in question, which by its terms
enabled th© non-public schools to go into the Ne.w York state

5
Court of Claims and to sus in the Court of Claims to collect
that second payment for the '71-72 school year.
At the time this case which is before the Court
today was selected as a test case to be tried In advance and
be determined in advance of any other cases under the statute.
The state moved to dismiss the claim in the Court cf Claims on
the basis that 'the statute was merely a resurrection of the
statute which this Court had declared to be unconstitutional
in 1973.
Q

Mrs. Coon, is that not a rather strange posture

for the attorney general to be taking both in the New York
courts and here, to be saying that a law enacted by the New
York Legislature is unconstitutional?

Usually, it is ray

understanding, the attorney general's job is to defend laws
enacted by the legislature.
MRS. COON:

As a normal state of affairs, that is

true.
Q

Why is it different here?

MRS. COON;

it is different here because it is--we.ll,

for one thing we felt, that as a matter of policy, this Court
having coma down with a decision holding the underlying statute,
the 1970 statute, unconstitutional, that we had an obligation
to uphold the decision of this Court.

But additionally it is

as a matter of practice in defending the state in the Court of
Claims under those enabling acts—-and this is a relatively

6
common practice by the New York State Legislature to pass
acts enabling certain claimants who, for on® reason or another,

were unable to bring an action originally under the Court of
Claims Act--it is a practice of our office to defend in many
instances by contesting the constitutionality of the statute
itself.
Q

There is certainly nobody else to defend it,

is there?
Mis . COON :
Q

That is quite true, Your Honor„

Otherwise the legislature could pass grossly

unconstifcutional—flagrantly, patently unconstitutional—
legislation awarding money to people.

They would just come

into the Court of Claims and get it, and there would be nobody
to defend—
MRS. COON;
Q

That is quit© true, Your Honor.

—on the basis that the legislation was

uacons fcifcutiona1.
MRS. COON:

And on©.of the basic argunants that we

frequently aake and which was on® of the- arguments made in this
case itself as a state constitutional argument is that in many
cases V7Q challenge the statutes on the basis that they
constitute moonstitutional gift of state funds.
Q

That could not follow if the ..applicants deal

with it.
MRS. COON;

No.

In those cases they are: dealing with

state constitutional questions.

In this case we were dealing

with a federal constitutional question.

And that was the basis

upon which the Court of Claims and the state courts all
decided, that it was on th® basis of federal

constitutional

questions„
Th© state Court of Claims agreed with the state's
position, granting the motion to dismiss on the basis that the
statute was indeed a reenactment, even if only for one payment,
of the statute held unconstitutional by this Court in 1973.
And in so doing th® court distinguished this Court's decision
in the second Lemon case—-Lemon against Kurt groan--which
permitted tie final payment under the Pennsylvania statute
which had been declared unconstitutional in the first Lemon
case.
T.iis case, however, in the posture in which it is
presented to this Court has one additional issue which arises
out of the hew York Court of Appeals' decision.

And I believe

it is that decision which brings really the first argument
which must be presented to this Court because in scheduling
argument in this case, the Court delayed decision on jurisdic­
tion, pending the oral argument.

And we recognise that what,

wf) are appealing from here is technically an order of the
Court of Appeals which did remand this case to th® Court of
Claims for an actual trial on the amount of damages.

We

submitted to this Court—and in fact the appellees here agree—

8
that the Court of Appeals' decision was final for the purposes
of jurisdiction in this Court because it did finally determine
the question of constitutionality under the federal Constitution
of the 1972 enabling act.
But additionally we submit to the Court that the
Court of Appeals in its decision interjected a new element
which we consider to be a new element of unconstitutionality
into this decision.

The Court of Appeals in remanding to the

Court of Claims adopted the minority decision in the state
appellate division.

In that decision the opinion cf the

minority in that court said chat the issue of how the funds were
actually used by the schools and whether or not they were used
to further the religious purpose of the schools could and
should b© tried in each claim in the Court of Claims.
W'S should not© that, under the New York. State
Constitution the power to audit and determine claims against
the State of New York is given to the Court of Claims.
Consequently, we feel that the decision of the Court of
Appeals interjected into this statute an element which was not
present whan the underlying 1970 statute was before this Court,,
and that is a question of excessive entanglement between church
and state because the auditing function which would b®
performed by the Court of Claims in the trial of these cases
is significantly similar to the auditing requirement which this
Court found to be unconstitutional in the first Lemon decision.

9

Q

In Lemon it was a recurring audit, was it not?

And her©, I take it, it would just be a one-shot deal»
MRS. COON:

It was a recurring audit, Your Honor,

but I think that the distinction—it raises a question of
whether or not ssmsthing can bs a little bit unconstitutional.
It was the auditing function—
0

That is not a vary satisfactory «mswer.

I mean,

all sorts of questions up here turn on matters of degree and
disctincticas of that sort, do they not?
MRS. COON:

It may be, Your Honor, but it seems to

me that in this type of situation that if the Now York state
Legislature were to be enabled to enact a statute similar to
this, then this could be clone any time a. similar statute is
found to be unconstitutional.
Q

Mrs. Coon, in Lemon against Kurtsman I had

thought that the entanglement concept was regarcad by the Court
as very dubious and contributed to unconstitutic nality because
it was a ccitinuing relationship, a continuing entanglement,
so that it Is not a matter of being a little unconstitutional
or wholly ’unconstitutional ■when you have one audit as against
a. contiauinj audit over a long ported of time.

It is a

question of whether on© audit creates entanglement, is it not?
MRS. COON:

Yes, it is. Your Honor, and I think her®

w@ have a situation where an entanglement, if any
exists for the entire duration of the statute.

exists, it

And that may be

10

the analogy there, that this is the statute,
0

If it is just to finish recoupment for the

particular fiscal or budget year, then it is not continuing,
is it?
MRS. COOK:

No, Your Honor.

But the original

statute, the 1970 statute, simply provided a lump sum per pupil
payment.

At the time this statute which is before the Court

now was enacted, it was the understanding, I believe, of all
the parties, including the legislature, that what the legisla­
ture was doing was providing for the Court of Claims to make an
award which would be a mathematical computation of the same
lump sum amount.

But what the Court of Appeals has done in this

case is to provide for an audit by the Court of Claims, an audit
which will go into the question of how all of this money was
used in the school year, to go into the question really of an
analysis of the tests which were given by the teachers involved
her© and determine whether or not those services—because what
would ba involved her® is the compensation for the teacher to
prepare a test—whether or not these tests furthered the
religious function of the school.

And we would submit to the

Court that chat type of situation, even on a one-shot deal,
would creat -j an excessive entanglement situation between the
courts of New York state and the non-public schools.
Q

Mrs. Coon, may I ask you a question about what

is going to happen if the case goes beck:

On. this $45 per

XI
pupil—I guess at least in the higher grades--exactly what is
to be determined?

Supposing they find out that that artount of

money was actually spent, but $5 of it could be said to have
been contributed to some religious purpose.

Would they get

$40 or nothing?
MRS. COONs

I would assume that under the Court of

Appeals' decision they would get the $40, the way the Court of
Appeals' decision reads.
Q

Suppose they found that they did not actually

spend $45 on the test, they only spent $40, but there was none
of it for religious purposes.

Would they gat the $45 then or

just $40?
MRS. COON:

They would get $45 under the"statute.

It is for testing and. record-keeping purposes.

And the record

before this Court in 1973 was -that the lump sum per pupil
allotment actually came out. to loss than the actual costs of
performing ill of the services.
Q
excess.

If that is true, then there is going to be soma

Would you argue .that that excess necessarily

contributed to the religious mission?
MRS. COON:
trying this

It may be, Your Honor, in going back and

this casa could be tried in a posture in which the

schools; could put in their claims for the clearly constitu­
tional—what; we would consider to bs the clearly constitutional

tin at:':orii-nce

il record heaping, the

12
administration of the state mandated

tests, the state

regents and various other state prepared and mandated tests—
and that in fact none of the per pupil amount might necessarily
relate to the teacher-prepared tests at all.
In other words,, if the schools put in their claim
for their costs, could actually--might in some cases coma up
with costs which would be acknowledged to be constitutional
expenditures without reaching the question of the teacherprepared tests.

In others they would not.

It would be when

you get into this question of the teacher-prepared tests—they
raach the question of the cost of teacher-prepared tests—that
you wousd run into the question of entanglements.
Q

Does the record now tell us exactly what they

are going fcs ask for?
MRS. COON:

No, Your Honor, because the claims were

filed, based on the mathematical computation.
Q

And you said filed for the $45 per pupil

period?
HIS. COON %

$45 par pupil; $27 per pupil in the

elementary grades.
Q

And then the purpose of the audit—2 am still

concerned about the finality question.
Mi IS. COON z

The finality, it seems to us, arises

basically in the fact that the stats Court of Appeals* decision
finally determined the question of the constitutionality of

13

this statute under the federal Constitution,

In. going back

into the Court of Claims, there is nothing that the Court of
Claims in i further decision in this case--or in any of the
state appellate courts in a further decision in this case—
could say which would affect the Court of Appeals' decision
as t© the constitutionality of the underlying enabling act,
C

But the exact effect of the Court of Appeals®

dacision? I gather from your response to Justice Stevens5
questions^ on the constitutional issue is not going to be clear
until the Court of Claims interprets it and decides whether so
much will go or the whole thing will go,
MRS. COOh's

That would be, it seems to me, Your Honor,

part of the mathematical computation,

If this Court were t©

say that the Court of Appeals was correct in saying you go back
and try those issues and that this doss not constitute, as we
feel it does, an excessive entanglement, than it is simply a
question of applying—of trying the issue of what each school
was doing with this money.

It does not affect the underlying

question of whether or not the state could constitutionally in
effect resurrect the 1970 statute by an enabling act.
/

Q

Are you relying at all on the fact that the

invalidation at the trial court leva! was during the school
year rather than after?
MRS. COON:

I think that the position of the

appellees hsr® is better in effect because of the fact that

14
the invalidation cam© during the school year.
Q

Is better

than if it had com® after the school

year?
MRS. COON:

Had come after.

Your Honor that actually it seams to me

And I would submit to
that it does not make

any difference—
Q

I would think that it would be just the other

way around.
MRS. COOK;

Having com© during the school yearf, they

If it came after the close of the school year and prior

to the commencement of the next school year, you would not have
that argument.

We submit to tha Court that that is one of the

basic differences really between this case and the second

I just do not follow you at all.

secular educational services from the non-public schools.

One

of the basic* arguments in support of enabling the schools in
Pennsylvania t® collect that final payment, the final year’s

15
payment under the Pennsylvania statute, was that the schools
had in fact; budgeted their funds in reliance upon the receipt
©f that aid.
Q

when it is invalidated during the year, that

element of reliance expires, does it not?
MRS. COON:

They presumably budgeted their school

would be collecting this money.

of that school year, were they not?

I was just trying to build up an argument for

you that yon do not want to accept.

MRS. COON:

No, this is why 1 say that the

appellee's position here, I feel, is stronger with this having

the close.
Q

I think it is weak, but then go ahead.

MRS.

COON:

But we would say to the Courtthat in

this case that does not really follow because this statute,
the 1970 statute, was under attack from the -time it became
effective? that unlike the Pennsylvania statute where they had
a District Court decision prior to it reaching this
where

Court,

they had a District Court decision saying the statute was

unconstitutional, the constitutionality of this statute was
always at issue and was always in a situation in which the
schools could not really rely upon the continued implementation
of the statute, that any time a preliminary injunction could be
requested, that at any time a District Court decision could
have hsld it unconstitutional.

The fact that they collected

state aid under the statute for a year and a half is not
something upon which they could rely because the statute always
was

under

attack from the time it became effective, and

there was always that element of uncertainty-

We would say t©

the Court that there was in tho Pennsylvania statute situation
an element, if not of

certainty, an element at least of some

reassurance in the fact that the District Court had held the
statuta constitutional.

17
0

May I ask you a question about your statement

that the statute always was under attack?

My recollection is

the suit was brought, the day before the statute became
effective—it said July 1st—-and no action was taken, no
request was made for a preliminary injunction until April 11th,
nearly two years later,
MRS, COOKs

That is quite true, Your Honor.

The

action was commenced the day before the statute became
effective.

But, as 1 said, the action was commenced; it is not

a situation in which the statute was allowed to go into
effect and continue in effect for a year or
started.

jo

before it was

The case was started, and there were movements afoot

in terms of interrogatories that were submitted and so forth.
But the cas.2 was underway the antira time the statute was in
effect,
Q

But net even a request for a preliminary

restraining order?
MRS* COON:

No, Your Honor, there was not,

0:se of the reasons why we feel there is a distinc­
tion between this Court's decision in the Lemon case and in
this, the other one really is that the—in the Lemon situation
what was held unconstitutional there was net the services, not
the payment for the. services that were being compensated for
to th© non-pub3.1c schools, but the fact that there was this
excessive aid continuing auditing process which the Court

18
considered to be excessive entanglement.
Q

In Lemon II—

But that excessive entanglement stopped with

our holding, did it not?
KRS. COOK:

Yes, it did. Your Honor.

So, in New York there will be no future

Q

continuing entanglement.

bRS. COON:

No, that is true, Your Honor.

But I

think I am getting beyond the question of finality now.

What

I am trying to do is distinguish the two statutes, the type of
payment.

This Court in Lemon II

said that in effect the final

payment to the non-public schools in Pennsylvania would be
permitted because the unconstitutional aspect of that statute
had already occurred.
occurred.

In other words, the audit hed already

It was just a. question of paying out the amount

in question.

In making that final payment, there would be no

unconstitutional feature involved.
On the contrary, in this case, w© have a situation
where what was held unconstitutional by this Court was not an
auditing function or continuing function but the fact that
among the tests that would be compensated for under the act
war© those /hich were teacher-prepared and which this Court held
go b© an integral part of the teaching process of the non­
public

schools.

And it was the compensation "for those

teacher-prepared tests which the Court found to be unconsti­
tutional.

.did we submit to the Court that in this enabling

19
act, what the Legislature of the State ©f New York has done
has been t© say to these schools, "You may collect, even if
only for this one final payment, compensation for services
which the United States Supreme Court has held to be
unconstitutional in terms of compensation by the state."

Nov/,

w© submit to the Court that this is a significant distinguish­
ing feature between the permission ©f the final payment in
Lemon II

under the Pennsylvania statute, and the provision

for payment hare.

And we submit to the Court that this makes

this payment here unconstitutional under the federal
Constitution, and it constitutes a resurrection--even if only
for one tints—-of the statute which this Court held unconsti­
tutional in 1973.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD E. NOLAN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. NOLAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Courts
My name is Richard Nolan.

I represent Cathedral.

Academy.
The issue here is whether this case is controlled by
•the rationale of this Court’s decision in Lemon II

where the

Court balanced in a very flexible way, in a very equitable way,

20

constitutional matters as opposed to reliance interests.

In

this case the courts below™I am referring to the Court of
Claims, I am referring to both the majority and dissenting
opinions in the appellate division, as adopted by the Court of
Appeals--found that these schools had relied, in terms of
planning their budgets—which have to'be done before the
school year begins*»-in a way so that Cathedral Academy would
expect to receive probably about $14,000 per year in two
annual installments, and they would act on the basis of their
expectation of receipt of that monay,
Q

Mr. Nolan, right at that point I want to be sure

you clear it up for me, the reliance issue.

Is it. not correct

that the services and the testing and all that for which the
school* are seeking reimbursement ware required by7 state law?
MR. NOLAN:

I believe that is so.

Schools have to

They nave to maintain health

They have to provide—
Q

Then would they have not had to perform these

services entirely apart from any reliance on other funds?
Ml. NOLAN:

They would have had to perform the

services, bit they would not have expected any reimbursement.
What the Mandated Services Act did was to give the schools an
expectation of reimbursement of certain monies which they could

Q

So, the real harm to the school is not having

all the funds available for replacement for funds that will be
used for general purposes?
MR. NOLAN:

I think -the funds that would have been

purposes of the school, would have been additional money.
Q

So, it is really the same case as if these funds

were just general subsidy to that extent?
MR. NOLAN:
case.

I think that was raised in the Levitt

But I think as to that, this Court has never said that

simply because payment is made to a school which enables it
to free up other funds, that that is a violation of the
Establishment Clause.

This argument was made by the state in

its brief, and I think we have answered it on that basis,
referring to the Roemer case„
C

That the whole concept of reliance here is

really inability to free up funds for general purposes.
MR. NOLAN;

That is right.

That is right, Your Honor.

In the Mandated Services Act case, the Levitt case,
I think 'the chronology is fairly significant because the
statute was attacked almost immediately.

In fact, I think the

lawsuit was filed either contemporaneously with the statute or
vary shortly thereafter.

Nothing was dona in that case by the

plaintiffs sxcept to move for the convening of a three-judge
district court.

That motionjwas opposed by the state,

22
opposed by the interveners, but was granted by the District
Court.

That meant that in the District Court's judgment there

was a substantial federal constitutional question which required
the convening of a three-judge district court under the
statutes than in effect.

Then the case remined quiet for at

least another year, into 1972.

And I think the reason for

that was because this Court had before it the
and tbs Tilton case.

And putting aside the general question

as to the precision with which people can predict the outcome
of First Amendment, church-state cases, there was a great deal
of question in everybody's mind as to what effect the Lemon
and Tilton cases would have on the Mandated Services Act.
It was not until 1972—in March of 1972—that the
three-judge court called for briefs.
Q

By that time-—

In the meantime, there was never an application

for injunctive relief?
MR. NOLAN:

There was never an application for a

preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order, Your
Honor.

The case simply remained at rest.

The decision came down in June of 1973.

And monies paid over what period of time are to

b® reimbursed under the act here in question?
MR. NOLAN:

Monies which would have been paid for

the second half of the 1971-72 school year.

In other words,

those would have been paid had the District Court’s decision not
com© down when it did—those monies would have bear., paid
between April 15th and June 15th of 1972.

The District Court's

temporary restraining order , followed by its fcwo-to-one
decision in late April of 1972, blocked the payment of those
funds.

And it is those funds that Chapter 996 is intended to

address itself to.
Q

What is the aggregate of that sum?

MR, NOLAN:

The aggregate of the sum—I believe the

state has-*C

Of the $14,000, what does this involve?

'MR. NOLAN:
is $7300.

The aggregate of this particular claim

That would represent one-half of the reimbursement

which Cathelral Academy could have expected to receive.

Q

But this is a test case, I gather.

MR. NOLAN:

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

we have considered it to be a test case

-The stata and

25
Q

And 396 would involve how much?

PR. NOLAN:

996 I think would involve a total amount

of claims filed in the Court of Claims of about $11 million
by, I believe, 2000 schools.

So that we are talking about

not $14 million but something reasonably close to it.
One of the attempted distinctions that the state
makes 'with respect to Lemon is that in Lemon there was
procedure under the

an audit

statute which audit procedure had been

completed except for certain administrative details by the time
the case was concluded.

In this case the Mandated Services Act

did not have an audit procedure, and that was one of the
problems we had with it.

It provided for a lump sum payment,

and that is one of the things that this Court found to be
defective.
In Chapter 996 what the legislature has attempted to
do is to give to the Court of Claims jurisdiction to hear
claims against the state for reimbursement of mandated services.
The state claims that this is going to create an entanglement.
First of all, it is a one-time reimbursement.
again.

It cannot occur

The statute on its face applies only to whatever portion

of th© second half of the 3.971-72 funds ax’© found by the
Court of Cl iims to be reimbursable.
Secondly, we do not have her© a situation such as in
the ordinary entanglement situation of the administrative
officers of the state government—in New York's case, the

26
state education department—• coming into the schools and in
effect telling the schools what to do or interfering with the
schools’ operations, whatever they may be.

What we have her®

is a judici.al proceeding in the Court of Claims, v;hich handles
all money damage cases against the State of New York.

We have

a situation here where s claimant, just as a construction
claimant ox anybody who has a contract fight with the State of
New York, will com© in and will attempt to prove what services
he perforate 3 that he is entitled to recover against the 3tat©
either on a theory of contract or on a theory of statutory
authorization or quasi-contract or what.
Q

Did you get into the question of whether or not

it was religious work?
MR. NOLAN:
Q

That is a little different from the contractor.

MR. NOLAN:
Q

I believe so, Your Honor.

X think that—

It is a litti® different?

MR. NOLAN:

That is, yes.

But I think that that can

bs handled under the procedures that have been sat up, as
indicated it the opinion of Presiding Justice Herlihy at the
appellate division, which opinion was later
majority opinion by the Court of Appeals.

adopted as the
X think so far as

attendance records, health records, the costs of providing the
state’s standardized regents examination, pupil evaluation
performance escamination and th© like , there should not be any

27
problem there.

The problem that arises, as Mr. Justice

Marshall lately points out, is in making sure that no
reimbursement will occur for examinations which tend to
propagate religion.
Presiding Justice Herlihy stated:

"However, it is

readily apparent that it was never the intent of the
legislature; that any ©f its funds were to be allowed for the
furtherance of religious purposes.

In this regard, the audit

by the Court ©f Claims must serve the same purpose as the final
post audit which was referred to in Lemon II.

Accordingly, the

burden will be on the claimant to prove that the items ©£ its
claim are in fact solely for mandated services, and the burden
will ba upc-n the Court of Claims to make appropriate findings
in regard thereto."
So, I think the Court ©f Claims is going to have to—•
if claims if re mad® for reimbursement of teacher-prepared
examinations-~wi 11 have to taka evidence of what those
examinations consisted ©f and satisfy itself, if it. can do 30.
or if the claimants can carry their burden o:: proof, that this
was not. a method of propagating religion.
Q

Mr. Nolan, is it possible that in that inquiry

there may ba exams that follow a pattern that heve beer u&ad
over the years and that may be used in the future—
MR. NOLAN:

Q

1 would think so.

—and there might be a legitimate difference of

28
opinion as to whether a particular exam propagates religion
or not?
MR. NOLAN;

I would think so. Your Honor.

But it

seems to me that, not only on the merits of the case but also
on the finality point, the law of New York now is what
Presiding Justice H@rli.hy wrote as adopted by the Court of
Appeals.

And it seems to mo that the law of New York is that

no money will be reimbursed for any tests which propagate
religion.

So that as a matter of state law, as a matter of

New York lew, no payments can be made for anything that
propagates religion.

And the Court of Claims—or the

appellate division or the Court of App@als--.it seems to me, is
perfectly capable of making those determinations as matters of
state law.

So that we do not have, I do not think—we do not

have a situation here where we have a real finality problem.
I think finality would com© within the first two teats of the
Cox B.r >Bd easting,Company case.

And I think the way the New

York courts have handled this situation so as to make the
question ©f religious propagation or reimbursement, for
religious propagation matters of state law means that this
Court need not worry about the case coming back up,
Q

Is it possible that that is also a federal

question?
MR. NOLANt

Yea, bt.it I think it will be decided as

matters of state law because of the way that Presiding Justice

t

29
Herlihy and. the Court of Appeals—
Q

But if you agree that there is legitimate room

for a difference of opinion as to

whether a particular test

has religious propagation features and you have a large number
of claims, is it not possible that the trier of fact must make
a large number of determinations of the religious versus lay
issue?
MR. NOLAN;

It; may vary well be t although I would

think there would be certain patterns.

We are talking about

examinations that were given at one particular semester.
Q

By a large number of schools, and it may not

necessarily b© the same exam.
MR. NOLANj

1 would think that in many esses it would

not bs the same exam, and it would be a burden on the Court
of Claims.
Q

But you do not think this would be excessive

entanglement to be reviewing literally dozens of exams to see
haw many have religious overtones?

MR. NOLANs

1

would not think it is any more difficult

than the problems the Court of Claims has gone through in trying
to sort out who gets paid for what in the South Mall in Albany.
The cl liras

:m

t'h® South Mall are immense and require a

tremendous amount of time and energy by the Court of Claims.
Q
religion?

But it did not have anything to do with

MR. NOLAN:

Nof It did not.

But there is no reason

v;hy—
Q

Thera is no entanglement involved?

MR. NOLAN:
Q

That is right, Your Honor.

But it is involved here?

MR. NOLAN:

It could be involved hare, but I think

the Court of—
Q

Is it not involved?

MR. NOLAN;

I say it is.

It is involved, but it is

not excessive entanglement because it is a one-time process by
a court which is capable of handling this as a legal matter.
It does not involve any intrusion by the state education
department.

And finally it deals with matters which occurred

over five years ago,

Q

will not the state education department have to

review all these exams and docide what position 'to take with
respect to each in the litigation?
MR. NOLAN;

I believe the attorney general's office

would represent the state in proceedings In the Cdirrt of
Claims.
Q

Some claims would involve religion; others they

would decide.-, ar© not sufficiently serious if they had to check
on it?
MR. NOLAN:
Q

I would think there would have to be—

What, is your view, Mr. Nolan, if in conducting

31
the audit it is determined that only $40 par pupil was in fact
spent by a school? does the school get $45 or just $40?
MR. NOLAN:
Q

1 would say $40,

Because the statute contemplates kind of an

actual reimbursement rather than a per pupil
MR. NOLAN:
t

thing,

The statute contemplates, as I read it—

But how does that answer t.ha reliance question

if the school relied on a full $45 and they only—
MR, NOLAN:

It just means that perhaps the statute

did not quite meet the full affect that its sponsors intended
it to meet.

But the statute again has not been construed in

that light by the New York courts.

They have not addressed

that question.
Q

What if they did not spend the full $45, they

only spent $40 and $5 of it was for religious oriented exams;
would they then get $35 or would they get nothing?
MR. NOLAN:

They would gat whatever they wore

Q

They would get $35.

MR. NOLAN:

—involve reimbursement for religiously

oriented ex minations.
Q

Mr. Nolan, we have had a couple of decisions

in the last several years that I notice are not cited in either

of. the briefs and perhaps ar© not relevant.

Blue Hull I think

was the. namo of one and Serbian something. the name of the other,

32

which in ©ffect w© held I think it is no business of the
courts to be deciding what is religion and what is not,

Property disputes?

spring of 1972.
Q

1 thought we held in those cases that if it is a

you have got to decide a question of religion, then courts have
to stay out of it.
MR. NOLAN:

how property was to fc® divided up in the case of a—
Q

I think the Serbian case involved more than just
It involved who was the bishop and whether or not

a determination of whether one or the other was the bishop was
anything that lay courts could gat into.

And I thought we

held they cannot.
MR. NOLAN:

I think this situation is somewhat

different because this is in ©ffect a claim for services
rendered.

And if a church school that has some contract with—

Q

It is a claim to property, is it not?

MR. NOLAN:

It is a claim for money that the

schools-™
Q

That is property, I suppose.

MR. NOLAN:

It is property in that sense.

But

following that rationale a church or a church school could
never seek to recover damages from a stats in the Court of
Claims or in any other court because the courts would be
incompetent to decide those things .
Q

Why is that?

MR. NOLAN;

I do not understand that.

I do not agree with it.

I am simply

saying that that would be an important proper result.
Q

I do not agree with your statement.

I would

think that a church could recover money in any dispute where
it did not involve passing on religion.

Mr. Justice Brennan

is suggesting to you that this is just entanglement by another

name.
MR. NOLAN:

It may be entanglement, but I do not

think it is excessive entanglement.
Q

Was not the Serbian Orthodox case based on a

whole line of cases of this Court that the courts have kept
out of intra—-intra—-quarrels of churches—
• MR. NOLAN:

That is right, Your Honor.

That is

right.
Q

—leaving that to the law of the church? Serbian
