MR. CHI-3? JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 76-69^2, Lakeside against Oregon.
Mr. Margolin.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILLIP Mu MARGOLIN, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, MARGOLIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Ensio Lakeside, the Petitioner in this case, was
charged with the felony crime of escape in the second degree.
Because he was indigent an attorney was appointed to assist him
in the preparation of his defense.

At trial, he raised the

defense of lack of criminal responsibility and put on witnesses,
including an attorney and a psychiatrist, to support his position
and explain his position to the jury.
Now, as part of his trial strategy, it was decided
between Petitioner and his counsel that Mr, Lakeside would not
take the stand and that no comment on this fact should be made
by Mr. Lakeside’s counsel during the course of the trial.

Just

before instructing the jury, the trial judge told Mr. Lakeside's
counsel that he was going to read the following instruction.
And the instruction reads:

"Under the laws of this State, a

defendant has the option to take the witness stand to testify
in his or her own behalf.

If a defendant chooses not to testify,

such a circumstance gives rise to no inference or presumption

4
against the defendant, and this must not be considered by you
in determining the question of guilt or innocence,"
Mr. Lakeside's attorney objected to the giving of
this instruction on the grounds that, giving the instruction
would highlight the fact that Mr. Lakeside had not taken the
stand and call the jury's attention to this fact.

The court

told counsel that he' felt that it was best to give this instrue
tion so as to protect the defendant's rights.

The instruction

was then given to the jury.
Ob appeal, we have two questions that we are
presenting for the Court’s consideration.

First, we think that

the judge’s action violated the Fifth Amendment to the United:
fatates Constitution.

The Fifth Amendment gives a defendant in

a criminal case the right to decide not to testify.

This Court

has held in Griffin v. California that if the defendant de- *.
cides to exercise this right the prosecutor and the judge shouldn’t make a comment on it to the jury.
Now, it’s our position that even though the judge was
acting with the best of motives and even though the instruction
was worded so as to be helpful to the defendant, nonetheless,
in this set of circumstances, by reading that Instruction,the
judge did mere harm than rood and in effect commented on the
exercise of the constitutional right by the defendant.
Additionally, we contend that the trial judge violated the
Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

5
Mr* Lakeside had a lawyer appointed to help him out
and figure out what his trial strategy should be, there was a
decision made and the decision wa's that they weren't going to
comment on the fact that he wasn't going to take the stand.
And we feel that when the trial judge took it upon himself to
interfere with this strategy that he was interfering with the
assistance that Mr, Lakeside had been given by -»
QUESTION:

Wouldn't that go to every time a judge

overrules objections?
MR» MARGOLIN
QUESTION:

No.

Well, where would- the line be?

MR. MARGOLIN:

Okay.

First of all, it's obvious if

there is a legal basis for the judge's decision — For instance,
let's say in the course of a trial the lawyer tries to put on
perjury testimony, or tries to put on testimony which violates
the hearsay rule.

In that case, a judge would have to inter­

fere with the trial strategy, of the defendant because that trial
strategy would be illegal.

In this situation, our position is. .

that there is no legal or ethical basis for the judge substi­
tuting his opinion of the proper way to conduct the defense for
the decision of
QUESTION:

And what case do you have that's real

close to that?
MR*-MARGOLIN:
QUESTION:

In —

Any place.

6
MR. MARGOLIN:

Well, I cited in my brief the Gedtiers

case and the Brooks v. Tennessee case.
QUESTION:

That is as far from that — I don't know

anything in that case that said that when you object to a
question that's ineffective counsel.
MR. MARGOLIN:

Okay.

The reason I cited Brooks and

the reason I cited Gscidere is those situations where this
Court held that when
QULLTION:

The Court said that -That’s your first point.

about your second point,
MR. MARGOLIN:
QULdTION:

I am talking

That was Fifth Amendment, wasn't it?
No.

Which one do you have on the Sixth

Amendment?
MR. MARGOLIN:
Amendment.

Brooks and Gedders were both bixth

Brooks was on Fifth and Girth Amendment ard the

Gedders case was Lixth, Your Honor.

And in both those situa­

tions,, this Court said that the trial judge ordinarily has
powers to do certain things.
QUALTIQN:

For instance, in Brooks -~

Your general language is that if a judge

gives an instruction over the objection of the defendant's
counsel, that's a violation of the Sixth Amendment.
MR. MARGOLIN:
QUESTION:

That's correct,

Following up my brother Marshall's question,

supposing the judge at the close of trial said,- "I am going tc
give an instruction on reasonable doubt and that the defendant

7
is entitled to the benefit of the presumption of innocence,
and his counsel objected to the giving o;f that instruction.
Would you be making the same point here?
MR, MARGOLIN:

Well, I think my basic position is

that ~~ I don’t know if the two situations are analogous.
QUESTION:

If they are not analogous, why are they

not?
MR, MARGOLIN:

Our position is that the assistance

that the attorney gave here was to advise the client on the
exercise of another constitutional right, the constitutional
right not to take the stand, and that the trial attorney and
the Petitioner's position in this should be honored by the
court, unless there is some legal basis for the court's inter­
vention.

The reason I cited the Gedders case and the Brooks

cases is because in those cases the court said that,in Brooks
that

ordinarily the judge does have a right to figure out

what the order of proof will be,

and in Gedders ordinarily

the trial judge can decide when witnesses should be sequestered.
But then the court went ahead and said that if there is a
conflict between these ordinary powers of the court and the
Sixth Amendment, that the Blxth Amendment should prevail end that
the trial judge shouldn't interfere with the assistance that the
defendant is getting from his lawyer.
Here, I think it is really a serious situation because
the defense counsel advised Mr. Lakeside on the exercise of the

8
Fifth Amendment right not to take the stand.

And from a

practical viewpoint that's about the most important decision
that a defendant in a criminal case can make,

If the defendant

doesn't take the stand, it causes a lot of problems as far as
his defense goes.

And if he makes that decision and then a

trial strategy is devised so as to soften that blow with the
jury, I think it is wrong for a trial judge to come in at the
end of the trial and interfere with the assistance in the trial
strategy that's been plotted out.
QUESTION:

If we rule that it's a violation of the

Fifth Amendment, will you be satisfied?
MR, MARGOLIN:
QUESTION:

Oh, sure.

Of course,

What would you say if the defense counsel

had asked for precisely this instruction, and the court said,
"Oh, no, I don't dare give that.
that sort of thing."

The Supreme Court doesn't like

And then he is convicted and goes on

appeal, saying he had asked for the court to instruct the juryon o conste&tut1 right.
MR, MARGOLIN:

What about that?

Okay.

You mean something like Bruno,

except on constitutional grounds.
Our- position is, with regard to the Fifth Amendment --and this has been

There is a split of authority as to whether

what the judge did here violates the Fifth Amendment,

And I

think that the problem that courts that have ruled against our
position have is that they cannot understand how an instruction

9
that supposedly is worded to help a defendant can ever hurt him.
And I think the most important thing I can put across to this
Court is that every criminal case has a different set of facts.
You don't have the same situation in each case, and sometimes
that instruction is very helpful, but sometimes it can hurt your
client.

And I'd like to give you two quick examples just to
/

show you "the realities of the courtroom situation and how this
identically worded instruction can be good in some cases and
bad in some cases.
Let's take a situation where it is helpful.

You have

a murder case and the defendant has made the statment that he
was never at the scene of the crime.
fingerprint at the scene of the crime.

Then the police find a
As soon as the jury

hears that, they are going to be waiting to hear the defendant
come up on the stand and tell them how the fingerprint got there.
And if your defendant can't take the stand, you are going to
want to have that instruction given in the hopes that the jury
will follow it and not hold it against him that he didn't get
up on the stand.
Now, if I can give you a different situation.

You

have a burglary
QUESTION:

I am not sure all defense lawyers would

agree with you on that proposition,
MR. MARGOLIN:

Well, I am just saying

One point I

should make here also is that because every case has a different

10

set of facts, I think that this Court should have faith in the
attorney who lives with the case, who has prepared it for
months and who conducts voir dire and gets a chance to sise up
the jurors who are going to be sitting on the individual case,
and let him make the type of decision as to whether or not in
this particular case the instruction should be given or shouldn’t
be given,

I think the trial attorney has advantages over a

trial judge who just gets the case on the day of trial.

I know

sometimes if you live with a case' for several months you get
insights into it that a person who just comes on it for one or
two days never does,

so I think it is really important here

to put faith in the trial attorney and let him make that decision
and not give the court the unfettered right,especially when we
are dealing with the advice on something as important as the
exercise of the Fifth Amendment privilege not to take the
stand.
Getting back to the second example that I wanted to
give the Court, if you have a burglary and a woman wakes u;>
in the middle of the night and sees a man in her apartment,
She subsequently identifies him in a lineup and your client is
arrested.

He comes to you and he tells you he is completely

innocent, but he has a very bad criminal record, maybe involved
in burglaries or sex crimes, something that would upset the
jury.

Additionally, you think he will make a very bad appear­

ance on the stand,

When you get to trial, you put on witnesses

11

who
/demolish the eyewitness.

You show that she couldn’t possibly

have seen what she said she saw.

She had been using narcotics

that evening and was out of her mind.

Additionally, you put on

twenty-five alibi witnesses who say that the defendant was with
them the whole time that this burglary occurred.

In a situation

like that, the jury probably isn't even going to expect to hear
from the defendant because his witnesses have given the jury
all the information that they would need to arrive at a verdict
in his favor.
And I think Petitioner's case fits into that second
category.

He had a medical defense, a psychiatric defense.

He put on witnesses who explained his position to the jury and
probably had the judge not read the instruction the jurors
would not have been thinking too much about the fact that he
didn't take the stand.
Now, I just want to check my notes because I think
that's basically onr position.

The only other thing I did want

to go Into is an argument that Respondent raised in his brief.
One of the arguments that was made in the brief is that you
cannot have error in a situation like this because jurors will
follow the instruction.

So, even if the judge shouldn't have

given that instruction, once the jurors heal’d the instruction
then they would follow it and-there wouldn't be any prejudice
to the defendant’s position.
I don’t think that is an appropriate argument- for

12

this case.

Anti the reason I say that is very simple.

First of

all. you could debate for years whether or not jurors do follow
instructions or don't, but if the trial judge had honored the
request that was made by the defense counsel and hadn't given
the instruction then you would have eliminated the possibility
that the instruction would Gause any harm and you would elimin­
ate any possibility of guesswork or any need to make guesses as
to what jurors do or don't do.

MR., MARGOLIN:

I know this

Court in Bruno said that in situations where -- Oh, you are
asking me in a situation where he does, in fact, take the stand
and then asks for it.

That's a tough question.

I don't know

in that situation whether it would rise to a constitutional
level or not, since he didn't exercise the constitutional
right.

I, am not sure whether in that type of situation it

would get to the same level.

any constitutional right by not getting on the stand? — By

MR* MARGOLIN:

Well, I think you would waive the

you would ask for that instruction so as to bolster your client

You.might ask for it, but the question

I don't know whether

you would have any right in that area.
QUESTION:

Mr, Margolin, before you go on.

required to take the stand.

I realize that Griffin, in effect,

reached that conclusion under the facts in that case.
Fifth Amendment speaks in terms of compulsion.

The

Where is the

You have a neutral instruction.

MR, MARGOLIN:

The problem comes in that

I mean in

the Griffin case this Court held that if the person chooses .not
to testify that it is improper to comment on that because it
is like penalizing the fellow for exercising his right.
Our position is that this instruction hurt my dies
because it drew attention to the fact that he hadn’t taken the

14

stand.

And it is the same thing as the prosecutor getting up

and saying3 "Hey, look, he didn’t take the stand.

Why didn't

he give his side of the story?"
QUESTION:

In Griffin, as I recall, not only did the

prosecutor make some reference to the failure to take the stand,
but the judge, himself, told the jury that it could consider
that fact.
MR. MARGOLIN:
QULoTION:

Tha t's right.

That was far from being neutral by the

judge.
MR» MARGOLIN:

That's right.

Our position is that

the wording of the instruction is not relevant, that it's just
like —
QUESTION:

Your position is that there is compulsion

either to mention or not mention this constitutional right,
however neutrally the mention may be.
MR. MARGOLIN:

That's compulsion?

Well, the problem — What it does is

it is a comment cn the fact that he didn’t get up and give his
side of the story.

And even though it's worded nicely it still

creates the evil of drawing attention to that fact.
QUESTION:

That's not what- the Fifth Amendment says.

It speaks in terms of compelling a witness to give evidence

MR. MARGOLIN:

Yes, but Griffin said that once that

decision to not take the stand is made you can't — the

prosecutor and judge can111 comment on it.

anything to do with the basis for the Fifth Amendment.

his constitutional right.

Mr. Margolin, is that really the whole
Isn't It the point that if the defendant,

before he makes the choice of whether or not to testify, knows
in advance that this kind of comment will be made by the judge
and the prosecutor, there is a form of compulsion that influences
his choice.

And isn't the same true here?

If he knows he

doesn't have any choice in whether the instruction is made, he
knows in advance that an instruction he doesn't want to hear
will be given, that that has some influence on his choice and
that is at least a modest form of compulsion.

Perhaps you have answered this, but you

have raised a Sixth Amendment question, too, haven't you?
MRcMARGOLXN:
QUESTION:

That’s correct,

Was this raised below?

MR, MARGOLIN:

I should point out to the Court that

the first time that the Respondent raised any objection to any
court that has heard this argument, hearing, it was in its re­
sponse to petition for certiorari.

This Sixth Amendment argu­

ment was argued in front of the Court of Appeals .and it was
argued in front of the Supreme Court, without any objection by
the Respondent.

If you read the Court of Appeals' decision

cut of Oregon, you will see that the trial strategy argument is
basically what v;as the foundation for their opinion.

And the

Respondent was informed prior to oral argument at the Court of
Appeals that the Sixth Amendment argument would be raised, in
addition to the argument on the Fifth Amendment.

And I think;

that the court in Oregon did consider this and that it is
appropriately before this Court.
QUESTION:

Certainly, the Supreme Court didn't

mention it, did it?
MRo MARGOLIN:

The Supreme Court didn't mention it

and that's why I wrote the petition for rehearing which is in

17
the Appendix,,

But the arguments were made in front of the

Oregon Supreme Court.

I don't know if this Court gets as part

of the record the taking of the oral argument, but that would
contain the arguments,

Additionally, the Supreme Court when it

granted a review in this case.this

was.also in-the-petition

the question that it asked was whether it was

error for the judge to give the instruction over objection and
then what the basis for such a rule was.

And it didn't limit

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS H. DENNEY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF
MR. DENNEY:

of the

REE POND ENT

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Like Mr. Margolin, I think my argument will not be a
lengthy one.

But I'd like to start it, since Mr. Margolin

spoke a little about the nature of the case, I'd like to flesh
out the actual facts that came out on the trial and that were
developed in the presence of the jury.

I do this for no other

reason, not because I am questioning Mr. Margolin's specific
trial strategy in this case, but to illustrate that reasonable
men at least could differ as to whether or not an instruction
not to draw an inference from the defendant's failure to testify
was proper in this case.

And that in any case the judge's action

18
In doing so was not an arbitrary or capricious one».

In addition,

perhaps the facts themselves as they were developed in this
case,and they are not in any of the printed portions of the
record that the court has, but they are in the record which was
transmitted.
I might begin by saying that the Defendant Lakeside
does have quite a background of an unhappy family history.
was a heroin addict and an alcoholic.

He

He had a prior conviction

of attempted murder dating from about 1972.

He was sent to the

Oregon State Penitentiary, paroled after about nine months,
violated his parole and was returned.
QUESTION:

Am I correct that the reason he didn't

take the stand was because he didn't want all of this known?
MR. DENNEY:

Mr. Justice Marshall, that seems to be

the argument, but the fact Is it all came out -QUESTION:

Then why are you just flaunting it around?

MR. DENNEY:

I am not flaunting it around improperly,

Mr. Justice Marshall, I believe, because my point is the jury
heard all of this.

All of this came in in the testimony of the

state psychiatrist, one Dr. Kolbak, who told the jury all of

this.
QUESTION:
MR, DENNEY:

I didn't realize that.
That's my point.

He was then charged

in about April of 1975 with the convictions that led to his
incarceration from which he escaped.

They were charges of

19

disorderly conduct, theft In the second degree, criminal mis­
chief and harassment, all of them misdemeanors under Oregon
law.

They arose out of three separate incidents and alcohol was

involved in at least one of these cases.
As a result of a plea bargain negotiated between the
district Attorney and the Public, defender of Portland, who was
representing Mr, Lakeside at the time, the agreement was that
lakeside would plead guilty to three of these charges.
fourth one, the harassment charge, was dismissed.

The

He would be

placed in the Multnomah County Correctional Institution which
is a minimum security place primarily for work-release people,
rather than being sent to the more maximum facility for mis­
demeanants:, in 'Multnomah County, Oregon, that is Rocky Butte
Jail.
Cii, and the other

and this was the important part

of the condition, as far as .Lakeside was concerned — and his­
tory of the case was that he would be required to take antibuse for his alcohol problem while he v/as in the correctional
institute.

He was somewhat reluctant to do so, as he told his,

counsel at the time, because he had had been made sick by having
taken antibuse before.

At least that was what he told his

counsel.
Anyway, he was received in Multnomah County
Correctional Institute on May 9, 1975;.
on May 21st.

He started on antibuse

He received some five or six dosages of it, the

20

last time being on June 15th.

On June 16th, he was given a

sign-out pass from 6:00 a.m, on June 16th to terminate at 10:00
p.m. on June 17th.
pass.

And he did not return from this sign-out

ArrJ under Oregon law, failing to return from a temporary

leave situation constitutes an escape.
Efforts were made to locate him and on the 23rd of June
the defendant’s mother called the police.

They said he was at

home and the police went and found him passed out and very drunk
and they returned him to the institution and that is

MR. DENNEY:
QUESTION:
MR. DENNEY:

I take it this is all in the record.
This is all in the record.
As part of his defense.
No.

All that I’ve said so far was

brought out in the prosecution's case.

The defense, as I've

said, did go to a mental disease or defect, also attempting to
make some use of the fact that this was aggravated by the use
of antibuse.

And the only real dispute of fact that occurs,

I think, in the whole case was that «*- was whether or not the
antibuse really did, indeed, make him sick* or whether it was
a combination of alcohol and the antibuse which led to the con­
dition that was observed.

Two guards, at least, at the cor­

rectional institute said that he never complained to them about
having any reaction from the antibuse even though it was adminis­
tered to him several times.

His mother and his sister testified

in his behalf that he complained to them constantly about the

21

reactions he was having from the antibuse.
QUESTION: All of this is leading up to the suggestion
I

that it vias an assistance, an aid and help to him to get this
instruction.
MR, DENNEY:

Yes, Your Honor,

overriding trial strategy.

1 am not insisting on

I am saying that the trial court

could reasonably have concluded the instruction was proper in
this case.

In the first place, as Mr, Justice Marshall was

asking, and as I tried to point out, his prior criminal record
came out anyway, so this is not one of those cases in which you
say he kept off the stand not to get the criminal record before

There was an insanity defense in this and while

reasonable minds can differ on this point, too, it seems to me

over the will of the defendant?
MR, DENNEY:
Court,
^

Yes, that's the question before this

We talked about two of the factors that are involved

in making that decision.

.Another is the question, I think -«

and these are the points that I've made in the brief -- where,
if this Is, as Mr. Justice Powell said, a neutral instruction,
and we submit that it is — where is the possibility of the
instruction having been given for reasons determined by the

23

trial judge, where is the possibility of harm?
One answer of this
\

in my argument, of course

and 1 set it up as a straw man
is to say that you have to assume

that telling a jury not to do something means that they may just
go ahead and do it.

We submit that that is an argument that

should not be espoused by this Court because it is not a good
idea and it is contrary, I think, to our basic notion of what
a jury system is all about, to assume that jurors are incapable
of following such an instruction.
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, how Is the State

hurt by a rule which says that if the defendant doesn't want
^

this instruction he shouldn't have it?
MR. PENNEY:

How is the State injured?

The State, itself, as prosecutor, is not

injured, I don't believe.
QUESTION:

And you don't think due process or the

people or anything -- You don't think justice is injured duly?
MR. EENNEY:

The only point I would make on that is

that I think that it should remain as a matter of general
policy and certainly as a matter of constitutional law, a
matter that is the province of the judge rather than of the
defense counsel.

I would just prefer to see — and It is

simply, perhaps, more a matter of philosophical views about
which we may differ ~~ to see the matter --QUESTION:
MR. uENNEY:

It pretty well could go under
Yes, it does.

24

QUESTION:

Weil., we are dealing with a constitutional

right, though, you know.
)

Maybe you should err on one side if

you are going to err.
MR. DENNEY:

That is a possibility, too.

It's just

that we are of the position, for the reasons that I am arguing
here and for the reasons that I stated in the brief, that there
is no possibility of erring in this matter.
Mr. Justice Stevens spoke about the matter knowing
whether or not the instruction would be given or not would in
some way, directly or indirectly ~~ well, more directly than
indirectly. -- would create a matter — would be a matter of
)

compulsion.

It would be a matter which would influence one

way or the other the decision of the defendant to take the

stand.
There are two answers to that, neither of which
one of which I know is not very good.

That is, it may not be

known in advance whether or not the judge in any particular
case is going to give that.

Presumably, of course, the

defendant could inquire and would get an answer from the judge,
but there may be judges cantankerous enough not to answer a
^

question along those lines.
QUESTION:
MR. DENNEY:

It wouldn't be binding on him, would it?
No, that's true, too.

The other thing is

--- it occurred to me as 1 thought about that, though — I think
that analysis might present some problems in the future because

25

that could be said of almost any instruction which the trial
court might give.
the defendant»

That might* again, have some influence on

I appreciate the fact that this particular

instruction goes directly, more directly than most, to the
question of whether or not -- What's to be said about whether
the defendant takes the stand or not may go more directly to
the issue of compulsion than some others.

But to some extent

I should think they all would.
QUESTION:
is.

You've been asked what the State's interest

Isn't its. primary interest a fair trial?
MR* DENNEY:
QUESTION:
MR. DENNEY:

Yes.
Is there any question about that?
I think not,

That's basically my

position.
QUi-TION:

Doesn't the judge have responsibility for

Instructing a jury as to what the law of the State is?
MR. DENNEY:

/s I think I answered

Mr. Justice

Marshall, not as articulately and not as directly as that put
it, yes.

I think the power to do that and the right to do

that remains with the judge and should remain with the judge
in preference to defense counsel.
QUESTION:

Suppose a defendant requested the judge to

give no instructions whatever on his behalf,
MR. DENNEY:
QUESTION:

I wonder about that.
Do you think the judge would be justified

26

in sending a case to the jury with no instructions as to State
law?
MR* DENNEY:

I most certainly do not,

Mr. Margolin

would have another view of it, though I rather doubt it when
you state the matter as bluntly as that.
QUESTION:

It would also be true there if he pleaded

guilty the judge wouldn't have anything to do but put him in
jail, would he?

He could give them all up if he wanted to.

MR* DENNEY:

The judge might not accept the guilty

plea*, for that matter*
QUESTION:

As a matter of fact --

You mean a judge wouldn't accept a guilty

plea to the maximum crime?
MR, DENNEY:

Your Honor, af ter ■ the first twelve:, jurors

were chosen in this case and before -QUESTION:
MR, DENNEY:

I am not talking about jorors being chosen.
Well, the defendant offered to plead

The defendant stated he wanted to plead guilty to this charge.
QUESTION:

No, it was to a minor charge, wasn't it?
T

MR* DENNEY:

No, sir, it was to escape in the second

degree.
QUESTION;
MR, DENNEY:
QUESTION:
MR, DENNEY:

V.'hafc he was charged with.
Which is what he was charged with.
And you say -»
The judge refused to accept the guilty

plea because the insanity defense had been raised in this case.

QUESTION:

That's right.

MR* DENNEY:
QUESTION:

That's what I said,

X am not sure what our difference is.
My point was you say that for justice,

regardless of what the defendant says, the judge can still do
so.

I am saying the general rule is that if a man wants to

plead guilty to the maximum offense it will be accepted,
MR. DENNEY:
QUESTION:

It generally will be.
Well, that's what I said, generally..

MR. DENNEY:

Very well.

Unless there are any questioni, I really have nothing
further to add to this oral argument.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. .Margolin, do you have

anything further?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OB' PHILLIP M. MARGOLIN, ESQ.,
UN BEHALF’ OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MARGOLIN:

Yes, Your Honor, just a few short

things,
First of all, I think that this Court can confine
itself to the very narrow issue of whether in this particular
case, if you '.have a petitioner or a defendant who gets advice
concerning the exercise of the Fifth Amendment right, vjhether
in this type of situation a judge can give instructions over
objections.

I don't think you have to go in and ask yours;elves

how this would affect other situations where the right that is
being exercised is not a constitutional right, because I think

£'8
different considerations might arise,

no I think the Court can

confine itself to that very narrow issue.
Secondly, I don’t think the reason why a defendant
in a particular case doesn't take the stand or whether the trial
strategy is correct or incorrect is relevant,
interesting question that is raised here is:

I think the
How far is a judge

permitted to go in deciding how a defense will be run?
QUESTION:

VJhafc if a judge in precisely the situation

that the circuit court judge was here and presented with your
client's attorney's objection to giving this instruction said
"X know that there will be a claim of constitutional violation
if I don’t give the instruction.-- If I do give the instruction"
— the claim that you are now making here --"I fear if X don't
give it, there will be a claim of incompetent assistance of
counsel."
MR, MARGOLIN:

Vi ell, I think you weigh that type of

a defense --- pardon me — that type of a post-conviction
claim or appeal, if there is a specific request made not to
give the instruction,

X mean we are dealing with a waiver

situation, under those circumstances, so I don't think that is
a real genuine problem.
CURSTION:

It would be in the hypothetical case put

to you earlier in the argument by my brother Rehnquisfc,

What

if a defendant's lawyer affirmatively requested the trial judge
not to charge, not to instruct the jury on the presumption of

innocence and the duty of the prosecution to prove guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt?

And the attorney said, "Please

do not instruct the jury on that subject,"

'and the judge set

"Okay, you're the lawyer and you4re the boss," so he didn't.
Wouldn't that be -- Would that be a valid conviction?
MR. MARGOLIN:

X think what would happen is that,

either in post-conviction or appeal, what the question would be
is:

Was the decision not to have those instructions given a

knowing and voluntary decision —
QUESTION:

The lawyer was a member of the bar.

He

wasn't a phoney and he was validly representing this client
and he thought for some strange reason that it would hurt his
client tc have that instruction given.
MR. MARGOLIN:

X think that if the defendant knew

what he was doing—-- X certainly wouldn't advise it — but if
he knew what he was doing, and he voluntarily and intelli­
gently made that decision to not have those instructions given
QUESTION:

Another difference between that case,

as you point out, just a strange reason could motivate that
request, but the request involved here, a substantial number
of State Supreme Courts think it is a very sensible request.
It's hard to say that that's malpractice.

But if you give the

example that Mr. Justice Stewart gives, it is only a strange
request.
MR. MARGOLIN:

That *s

30

QUESTION:

Well; let's get away from malpractice.

Suppose he is either representing himself, as they have a
)

right do do, and he made this request.
MRo MARGOLIN:

Again, I would prefer to keep this on

the very narrow issue of the situation where there is assis­
tance of counsel, because I think you can keep this in this
area without going into situations like what happens with
different types of instructions or what happens with a person
representing himself.
'QUESTION:

Well, we have to get away from any mal­

practice claim or any incompetency claim,
j

MR* MARGOLIN:

In the Faretta case the Court said

that a person has the right to represent himself and if he does
that and he foregoes the assistance of counsel and then he
makes that type of a decision, he may just be in a situation
where he has done himself a lot of injury, but if he is doing
it voluntarily and knowingly and he understands the conse­
quences, that might be the situation.

But, again, I don't

think that that type of situation should, affect the Court's
decision here because here it is a defendant who is getting

I

advice from an attorney who supposedly has some training and
experience in these matters, and it is being made through
discussion and then it:s being presented to the court as a
particular way that the defendant wants to run his case.
1 don’t think the decision in this case would affect that type

of situation.
There is nothing further.
MR0 CHIiiiP JU/riCi-; BURGhR:

Thank you, gentlemen«,

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon at 2:05 o’clock, p„iru, the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
