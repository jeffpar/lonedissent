MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER? We will hear arguments

Mr. Wagsfcaff, yon may proceed whenever you are

ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H, WAGSTAFF OK
BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
ME. WAGSTAFF;
the Courti

Mr. Chief Justice# and may it please

In 1972 the legislature of the. State of Alaska

adopted a law which gives a residency preference to all
designated Alaska residents in any job having to do with oil
®nd gas within the State.

The exact mechanism is that the

law requires that any person or party who has a con-tract with
the State in the nature of a lease or right-of-way permit or
the like to preferentially hire Alaska residento and to
first fire the residents of other States.

It's an across-the-

board preference to all Alaska residents..
The scope# -the swath# that this cuts is quite
broad.

It applies not only to these\contractors# it applies

to s?ibcontractors and. suppliers as wall.

It does not. have to

take place on State land.
We believe that this is a direst violation of the
privileges and Immunities Clause of the Constitution.

The

Supreme Court of Alaska split three to two on this issue.
We are asserting before this Court the dissents of -Justices

4
BoGchever and Rabinowitz in the Alaska Supreme Court which we
feel articulates exactly our position.

There is also a

Fourteenth Amendment claim presented as well.
The use of the word "residents” in the context of
Alaska Hire means domiciliary.
QUESTION s

'das the Fourteenth Amendment claim

passed on?
MR. WAGSTAFFs

Yes, it was, and it was denied as

well by ehe majority.
The preference is given to all residents who are
defined under the statute as domiciliaries.

And file purported

legislative reasons or justification for what is called
Alaska Hire is chronic unemployment within the State of Alaska.
The Supremo Court of Alaska, it is our position
and I believe appellees disagree, recognised that this was
a transparency and that in fact this was simply a broad-based
economic preference given to all Alaska residento in preference
to the residents ©f other States.

Additionally, Alaska Hire

itself supports that position adopted by the Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wagstaf£, would your position here

be precisely the same if Alaska restricted its residency
requirement to employment directly by the state?
MR, WAGSTAFFz

That issue, of course, the State

employment issue, is much different than this case, and Alaska
does have a case, State v. Wylie, that is cited, dealing with

5
governmental employment.

My personal belief is that I do

not feel that it is proper to discriminate against the residents
of other States even in State employment as well, or public
contrasts.

I realise that McCarthy v. Philadelphia Civil

Service Commission might indicate otherwise, but that issue,
Mr. Justice Blackmun, is not really relevant to this case
because we are talking about private employment here, not
governmental employment, or not public contract.
QUESTION!

You are really talking just about

pipeline or oil employment, aren’t you?
MB. WAGSTAFF!
so far.

Oil and gas as far as this law goes

And 'the employment covered is all employment that

results from such activities.

And the Supreme Court of

Alaska has recognised 'that this includes distribution and
refineries each as they may be built in the State of Alaska.
QUESTION 5

But there is no reason why a non-resident

can't go up and start manufacturing widgets.

He wouldn’t

violate this law.
MR. WAGSTAFFs

Hot this specific law, but in terms

of the danger of the law, if the widgets came from a natural
resource or had any sort of arguable natural resource nexus
in Alaska, then it would be a violation of the concept of this
law.
QUESTIONS
of thing.

But Alaska hasn’t prohibited that sort

6
MR.. WAG STAFF:
QUESTION:

Wot at. this tine.

Not yet.

Mr, Wagstaff, suppose that Alaska sat

up a WPA project as we knew in the depression.
little bit before your time, maybe.

That's a

But designed specifically

by the State to relieve unemployment among State residents
and restricted it to State residents.

Would you be here

attacking that one, too?
MR. WAGSTAFF:

Mr. Justice Blackman, those would

be public works type projects,, working on public works?
QUESTION:

Building roads and this kind of thing.

MR. WAGSTAFF:

Building roads, actually employed

by the State?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. WAGSTAFFs

Of course, that is a different issue

and we would not be here undor Alaska Hire on that issue.
I think that issue has been addressed in other eases.

There

are three levels of looking at that particular issue.

There

is the direct government employment, the employment by
private contractors on government projects, and what we have
here is strictly private activity now taking place on State
lands. * And the only nexus that the State asserts is that
they own the resources involved hare, oil and gas, and
therefore they can do whatever they want to with them.

They

can make any requirement whatsoever with regard to their
utilization.

7
Of course# this is one step even byond that.
This has nothing to do with extraction*

It's the jobs created

as a result of the oil and gas development.
QUESTION:

I*hi not sure I got your answer to Mr.

Justice Blackmans' question.
MR. WAGSTAFF:
QUESTION;

Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

I am not sure I got your answer.

MR. WAGSTAFF:

His question as I recall it# would

we be here if -this was a WPA project.
QUESTION:

And Alaska had provided that only

residents could work on the State“funded WPA project.
MR. WAGSTAFF:
that.

No# this is a different case than

We would not be here.
QUESTION:

I realise that# but would you feel that

you had substantial constitutional grounds if Alaska had
enacted such a law and your clients were excluded because of
nonresidency?
MR. WAGSTAFF:

Yes# I do.

I do think that would be

a constitutional violation of privileges and immunities if
residents of other States were excluded from this.

And I say

this •—
QUESTION:

So a State can't use its own tax moneys

to relieve unemployment among its own residents?
MR. WAGSTAFF:
violate the Constitution.

It can so long as it does not
In specific other types of projects,

3

for instance,, the dissent in the Hieklin case in Alaska said
that such things as job training,, such things as the Alaskan
Native Claims Settlement Act x»rere good bona fide ways of
addressing this problem without discriminating —
QUESTION:

The Alaskan Native Claims Settlement Act,

I mean a lot of people aren’t interested in just sitting at
home and getting a check every month to buy groceries.

They

want work.
MR. WAGSTAFF:

That's correct.

But I don’t think

the State can discriminate against the residents of other
States in such activities.

And we are talking directly about

public employment, as I understand the question.
Now, that's my belief and my position.

Again, it

is certainly not necessary to reach that in order to meet the
issue in this case.
The Alaska Supreme Court made it clear that they
were deciding this as a broad economic preference„flatly
stated, to Alaska residents.

There is a real question

factually or functionally as to whether or not Alaska indeed
owns the resources.

The resources, oil and gas, are actually

being extracted by private industry.,

The State has a claim,

to the sub: urface resources where they are being extracted

iroit,
There also is a strong national interest that has
been recognised by Congress twice in Alaska oil and gas,

9

once in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Act and more recently in
the Alaska Gas Transportation Act of 1976 in which Congress
makes a specific finding of the national interest.
QUESTIONS

What difference„ constitutionally,, do

ypu see, if any, in a statute
'

such as you have confined to

*

natural resources of Alaska and all employment in Alaska
independent of the resources, the source of the material.
MR. WAGSTAFF:

I don’t think there really is that

much difference, Mr. Chief Justice.

The State can usually in

Alaska and I am sure in other States, can usually find some
sort of nexus or tangential relationship with governmental
activity or ownership or proprietary interest so that it car.
offer this justification in other jobs as well.

That is one

of the things that th® dissent noted, that this would apply to
agriculture in Alaska, lumber, or anything else if the
legislature wishes to expand it that far.
QUESTION:

It could be expanded on tu. lir^

salesmen of Toyota automobiles which, so far as I know, don’t
draw on.any resources of Alaska for the manufacture.
MR. WAGSTAFFs

Well, they do have some nexus.

Most

of the crates that they are shipped in come from Alaska
lumber, but there would ba some nexus possibly to that extent.
'The State can always find some reason that, it has a touch upon
the particular job involved.

And that's one of the real

dangers of Alaska Hire is how much further under this theory

10

of State ownership of resources can it be expanded.

And, of

course, if Alaska does it, any other State can, and I think
predictably will.
I think Alaska6s problems are real, but they aren't
that much different from many other States at this time or
any other time.

And I think that under some of the cases that

we have cited in our brief, fcha proper way of dealing with
these types of problems is not by isolation and dealing with
them separately, that a State cannot insulate itself from what
is termed in scan® Commerce Clause cases as a national welfare.
So, too, the same national welfare has a legitimate national
public interest in the resources themselves.

And Alaska is

seeking, really, to isolate itself from the nation, from the
Onion, in dealing with these particular problems.
QUESTION;
•.on© thing?

Mr. Wagstaff, would you help me with

As I understand it, they hold unconstitutional the

’one year residency requirement.
MR. WAGSTAFFs
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

what exactly if it other than being in

the state for 30 days that your clients must do in order to
be eligible for work?
MR. WAGSTAFF:

It’s covered specifically by statute,

Mr. Justice Stevens, and it appears in the definitional
section within the appendix.

There is a definition of

resident in there, what a resident is .

QUESTION:

What page is that?

MR„ WAG-STAFF:

place of residency within the State*

And he must maintain a
Most importantly, he

must show by all attending circumstances that his intent is
to make Alaska his permanent residence, a clear domiciliary
situation»

Additionally, the Alaska Supreme Court majority

spent some five pages talking about tine steps that a State
can go to, or the State could go to to ensure that this is a
person who actually has made the commitment to Alaska, not
simply just come there in order to meet the 30-day require­
ment .
QUESTION:

You wouldn’t object to the residence,

I suppose, because I guess he has got to live in Alaska while
he is doing the work.

The main objection is to the declara­

tion of intent to make it a permanent residence.
MR. WAGSTAFF:

That's correct.

That's actually

although there is the position in our right-to-travel
argument that you actually have to go there before you
qualify for a job.
States.

It discourages job applications from other

And people cannot make inquiries as they historically

have done in Alaska by letter.

They actually have to make

a commitment to travel and spend a considerable amount of
money to get that far.
QUESTIONs

Your position, then, is that Alaska

12
could not evan prohibit hiring someone, say, from Kansas or
Texas who simply applied to an Alaska firm, that they could
not require 'the people even to show up in Alaska before they
were hired.
MR. WAGSTAFF:

That's correct.

I can see no

justification for that.
The state of Alaska based its opinion, the owner­
ship theory, strictly and exclusively on McCready v. Virginia.
which, if it has not bean overruled and not bean, severely
limited, should be today.

The State feels, as 1’ have stated,

that because they believe that they own the resources, they
can do with them as they sq© fit.
Kow, McCready is highly distinguishable and has
bean severely limited by the Tcome-r case in which this Court
refused to expand it any further than it already v?as, which
was very narrow and relates, of course, to the planting of
oysters in the tidal waters of the Weir River in Virginia.
It deals with access for planting of oysters to State
property.

It has nothing to do with resulting employment.

And, of course, in Alaska oil and gas is in commerce, and ws
believe it falls directly under the Poster Fountain Louisiana
shrimp holding, that is, the State relinquishes all ownership
claims such as they may even exist when it places and permits
the resources which it purports to own to go into commerce.

And that is specifically what happened here.

That is the

13
way Alaska makes money off oil and gas is having it sold in
other States.
The McCready case, of course, is limited as well
to fish and game in which there is an historical exception
or public interest that the court talks about at length in
Geer v. Connecticut, which is totally different, we believe,
than natural resources in general.

It’s talking about common

property, that is, property that is owned jointly by all the
people of the Stats which fish and game had historically been
thought to be, which is differant and distinguishable than
property ownership in chief or in general.
Also, McCready is a conservation case, as was
Cdrfxeld v. Coryell and as was asserted in Geer v, Connecticut.
And this case has nothing to do with conservation whatsoever.
Tfc has to dc with exploitation and development.
The conservation argument was made in Tooiaer y.
witsell as well.
Court

.And McCready, as was recognised by the

in Toomer, is the only case that has ever teen decided

by this Court in which there are no persuasive independent
reasons for the discrimination.

And the Court then, in 1948,

refused to expand McCready to encompass any other areas.
And I think this Court should do the same thing today, because
there are no independent reasons for Alaska Hire regardless
of the purported legislative purposes,

it's an across-the-

board economic preference for all Alaska residents.

And the

14
Supreme Court of Alaska recognised this as such, but said it
was justified because the State owned the resources.
QUESTION:

Isn’t the fact, of unemployment among

Alaska residents a perfectly rational reason for this?

It

doesn’t mean it is necessarily constitutional, but it is a
reason.
MR. WAGSTAFFs

It is a legitimate concern.

I

don’t think it is properly addressed by Alaska Hire because if
it is indeed the unemployed who are going to be benefited,
then it is those who should be given the preference.

But

it’s not just them, it's the employed, it's all Alaskans.
QUESTION:

If a parson has a job somewhere else,

he presumably is not a beneficiary of this.

If ha is

unemployed looking for a job, he is the beneficiary, isn’t he?
MR. WAGSTAFF:

Thase jobs that we are talking

about particularly are extremely high paying, extremely
desirable.

And it is very common for people t<- —
QUESTION:

Quit other jobs.

MR. WAGSTAFF: Quit, other jobs, including actually
several attorneys I have known who have gone to work on the
pipeline.
Of course, there will be another pipeline.

The

gas pipeline is going to be built probably in the next year
or two.

And, of course, this will apply to any other gas

exploration and development, oil and gas within the State, of

15
which it is predicted there will ba a graat deal.
QUESTION:

I am still not sura I understood your

answer to my question which was prompted by your assertion
that there was no reason whatsoever.

And my question was

isn’t unemployment among Alaska residents a reason?
MR, WAGSTAFF:

Yes, it is a reason, and it does

exist, as it exists elsewhere.

If you are talking about the

lowest level test that you can apply to it, you say, well,
there is some possible reason here that the legislature may
have articulated.
Now, that reason wa3 rejected specifically by the
Supremo Court of Alaska.
QUESTION:

It said what?

MR, WAGSTAFFs It said that this is simply an
economic preference.
QUESTION:

That’s the same thing, isn't it?

MR, WAGSTAFF:

No, no.

The trial judge found

that these were legitimate needs and they had been addressed
by the statute.

The Alaska Supreme Court rejected that

reasoning and said we rather prefer and believe that the
Alaska Hire is simply a preference —
QUESTION:

An economic preference; i.e», hiring

residents before you hire nonresidents.
MR, WAGSTAFF:

An economic preference to all

Alajkans, not just the unemployed.

Not the unemployed.

16

QUESTION:

But it would help the unemployed, even

under the view of the Supreme Court of Alaska.
MR. WAGSTAFF:

The unemployed Alaskans, yes.

But

the preference is not restricted to them,
QUESTION:

I am not sure I understand your answer.

The whole point of this case is that it is restricted to
Alaska residents.
MR. WAGSTAFF:

That3s correct.

That*e the whole

point of the case, and that it is impermissible to do so,
and that the unemployed justification for it
was rejected by the Alaska Supreme Court.

Didn't

they have some reason for doing it?
MR. WAGSTAFF:

They enacted it because they wanted

to —
QUESTION:

There must have been a re .;.on behind it.

MR. WAGSTAFF:

They wanted to give preference to

Alaska residents.
QUESTION;

Precisely.

MR. WAGSTAFF:

And that's what they did.

That's exactly what they have done.

And we believe impermissibly so.

The State does not have

17
that power to give preference, to its residents in resulting
employment from oil and gas exploration in Alaska, particularly
so when the oil and gas is in commerce, as it is here, and
that's how money is made*
QUESTIONS

If this statute were sustained here

and Alaska had another gold rush, could they extend the sweep
of this statute to gold mining?
MR„ WAGSTAFF:

Yes.

It can cover any State

natural resource that it purportedly or believes that it owns —
gold, coal, anything of that nature*

And, of course, any

State can do that.
QUESTION?

How many Alaskans could take gold out —

or non-Alaskans only after they had resided for one year?
Would that be the case under this statute?

As long as they

are permanent residents.
MR. WAGSTAFF:

Yes, they would have to show

permanonfc re3id@ncy.
QUESTION-:* Well, the one-year provision was struck
■down by the majority.
MR. WAGSTAFF:

Yes,

It was limited to 30 days.

■And, of course, this is done, by an enforcement procedure as
you apply for a residency card.
applicant.

The burden is on the

The residency card is good for two years and this

entitles you to preference if you are a card holder.
As far, Mr. Chief Justice, as the gold situation

18
is concerned,, if that were considered a State resource, which
it would, and the dissent clearly points out how much further
this law could go and predictably would, then it would apply
to gold as well*

And only in terms of employment--~we are not

talking about extraction -- in terras of employment in the
gold industry that residents would be preferred in all
employment,
QUESTION:

Can Alaska require that candidates for

public office be residents of Alaska?
MR * WAGSTAFF: Yes, it can.

It can and has, I think

properly»
QUESTION:

Why is that different from this?

MR. WAGSTAFF:

There are some legitimate exceptions,

if they be deemed such, to the Privileges and Immunities Clause,
I believe a State cannot discriminate against a citizen of
another State unless there is substantial compelling and
legitimate interest that is being furthered thereby and the
means chosen is the least drastic.

And voting is one such

category.
QUESTION:

Why?

MR. WAGSTAFFs

Well, that's how the State government

is controlled.
QUESTION:

But that isn't much of an answer, is it?

MR. WAGSTAFFs

Well, I think as far as the

controlling of how State government is created, how the people

19
choose the persons to govern that State, it is legitimate in
that content»
QUESTION ;
illegitimate.

Ona would think that would be quite

There is a kind of a self-perpetuation scheme

position, I am just recognising that it exists —

It not only exists; it has been upheld

MR. WAGSTAFF: Yes, it has been upheld.

So you wouldn't have floating governments

MR. WAGSTAFF;
QUESTION;

Right.

Spend six months in Alaska, six months

in Georgia, the next six months in California.

That's the

reason, isn't it?
MR. WAGSTAFF;

Yes.

And there are soma others, too,

as well that have been recognised.

For instance, tuition

differentials in cases have been recognised as allowing a
State which created the institutions, the taxpayers of that
State have paid for it, to discriminate in differentials for
tuition.

But that's the least drastic.

The in-State students

20

aren't given preference as they are in Alaska Hire,
I would like to reserve the rest for rebuttal, if
I may,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well,

Mr„ Lorensen.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD W. LORENSEN ON
BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR, LORENSEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

I think directly at th© outset it

needs to be pointed out what Alaska Hire effects is founded
upon is State ownership of resources and not just State
ownership in the more general usage of the fact that oil and
gas may be found within Alaska;, is because this oil and gas
was found on land, below land, which is owned by Alaska.

In

the true legal sense and despite what counsel for the
appellants would indicate, I don't believe there is any power
in Congress to require that Alaska sell, dispose of its oil
and gas as long as it sits in the ground and is not held
under private leases by private individuals.
However, Alaska has said, if we are going to lease
this oil and gas which we the State own on behalf of our
people, our residents, w® are going to require certain
conditions.
QUESTION:

And I take it your argument would be

the same if there wasn't a single unemployed person in Alaska.

21
MR. LORENSEHs

Yes, it would, with respect to the

underlying justification.
QUESTIONS

And your Supremo Court upheld the law

on the basis you are submitting?
MR, LORENSEN;
QUESTION s

Yes.

General Lorens er., I have been curious.

There .is scats difference of opinion in the briefs at least
as to the scope of this statute.

Is the scops measured by

section 30.40.050 appearing on page 0 of the appendix?
MR. LORENSEN:

It53 repeated in two places, but

section 050 does contain the scope.

I think section 030(a)

is really the underlying basis for it.

That section states

that in order to preserve rights of Alaskans to employment
a certain provision shall be incorporated into oil and gas
leases on pipeline rights-of-way where the State is a party
to those leases and rights-of-way.
QUESTION:

050 seems to be a little broader,

"•..must be performed directly for the person subject to this
chapter or his contractor or a subcontractor of his contractor
or a supplier of his contractor, or subcontractor.”
MR. LORENSEHs

Yes.

What 050 requires is that

a lessee who leases the oil agree that he will see to it that
"his subcontractors do in fact also hire Alaska residents —

QUESTIONs

And th* suppliers of his subcontractors.

MR. LORENSEN:

/' .. il suppliers.

22

7. would point out, Your Honor, that to this point

the suppliers aspect has in fact not bean enforced»

We have

had our hands full just enforcing with respect to actual
construction activity.
QUESTION:

Would this apply to refineries?

MR* LORENSEH:
which the refinery arose.

It would depend on the nature in
If it is built on State land which

is leased for that purpose, yes,
1

X

QUESTION:

No, no. If this is a refinery built on

public land, not State land, United States land,

You are not

taking over the United States land, are you?
MR. LORENSEN:

No, we are not. Are you speaking

of Alaska oil and gas which is being refined?
QUESTION:

Some of these pipelines run over United

States land, don't they?
MR» LORENSEN:
QUESTION:

Yes, they do.

Does this law apply to those?

MR. LORENSEN:

It applies to the extent that there

is employment taking place —
QUESTION:

Where do you get jurisdiction ovar

United States land?
MR, LQRENSEM:

Wall, it's not the land, Mr. r

Justice Marshall. It's the employment activity.
QUESTION:

Well, the pipe is on the land.

MR» LORENSEN:

Yes, but it's the employment activity

23

which we ero regulating.
QUESTION:

And you would go onto United States land

and enforce your state law?
MR. LORENSEN:
QUESTION:

Yes, and I think we have.

What percentage of the State work fore©

would be affected by this Act?

I think the brief said

roughly € percent?
MR. LORENSEN:

That’s correct.

At the height of

pipeline employment, it represented only 6 percent of the
entire work force in the State.
QUESTION:

Would that be true if you had included

suppliers as well as contractors and subcontractors or

lessees?
MR. LOPENSEN:

It may have been somewhat higher,

Mr. Justice Powell, but, again, as I indicated, w© have not
in fact enforced it against the suppliers at this point.
QUESTION:

But you could under the Act.

MR. LORENSEN:

We could.

Ws are limiting the

scope of suppliers by regulation very stringently, however,
to suppliers whose activity is 95 percent directly related
to that activity.

So we don’t grab a small supplier who

really doesn't have any direct contact with the pipeline.
QUESTION:

When you say suppliers,

the Act

applies to employees of suppliers, not to the suppliers them­
selves, 1 take it?

\

24
MIt„ LORENSEN:

Well? it requires that the supplier

hire employees who are Alaska residents»
QUESTION:

But the supplier himself or itself need

not be an Alfiskan.
MR. LORENSEN:

That's correct»

We don't place any

requirements in terms of who operates the. business , who the
business entity is.

That6 s correct.

So throughout your analysis of Alaska Hire, I urge
you to keep in mind the fact that what we are talking about is

2 think

that if wo just stop to think about it for a moment, that
those fears are store fears than practicality which will ever
arise.
For one thing, I doubt that there is any Stata
which owns the quantity of developable resources — and again

in th© quantity that Alaska does.

Sc that &s a practical

matter — and that would be -the extent of any decision by

QUESTION*

is that a valid argument?

Why, if your

position is correct, could not another state that didn't own
the resource© itself but just sought to regulate them just
a&y that anybody who works oa oil that comes out of Louisiana,
say, shall be a Louisiana resident? For the saiaa reason that
you want to protect your citizens from unemployment and the
like, why couldn't Louisiana do the same saying that in our

State will exercise this kind of jurisdiction.

Why wouldn't

that ba equally reasonable?

That argument does not form the

MR, LORENSEMi

That is certainly true.

Would you argue that Alaska could

MR. LORENSEN:
QUESTION;

I would not argue that.

So there is a limit on conditions which

the State avan as owner can impose
MS. LORENSEN;

I think so, yes.

Court has indicated some of the limitations.

The State Supreme
We have

presented to this Court and to the State Supreme Court an
alternative argument based simply on the State's power to
contract without ever looking at the exercise of its police
powers, where the State is the owner or whore the Stats wishes
to be a purchaser, that it may do so without the standard
restrictions of due process and equal protection requirements.
The State Supreme Court rejected that with respect
to the one-year durational requirement.

It didn’t address it

with respect to the remainder of the law.
QUESTION:

You are relying oa the State's power as

owner to contract with respect to the property which it owns.

MR. LORENSENs

Yes.

For State public employment.

Yes.
QUESTION:

But you wouldn’t say that the State

could require that all the oil taken out of the lands it owns
in Alaska be used only in Alaska.
MR. LORENSEN:

No.

It seems to me that that would

be directly contrary to this Court’s holdings in the West
Virginia—
QUESTION:

That would be a Commerce Clause

violation,, wouldn't it?
MR. LORENSEN:

That's right, Commerce Clause.

And

one of our point© is we are not affecting the product or its
distribution in any way by Local Hire.
QUESTION:

General Lorensen, with respect to this

one-third of the land in the State which is owned by Alaska,
I take it your theory would justify a statute which said, that
any purchaser of any portion of that land must as long as he
owns the land give preference in employment to Alaska residents
and require his purchaser to do the same.

So that forever for

ono-fchird of the State the employment preference could be
restricted to Alaska residents.
MR.- LORENSEN;

If we are -going upon a State power

to contract theory, yes, very definitely.

In the same way

it would be my argument that the State —- The State has

35

considered from time to time, and we may find ourselves in the
position very soon, of once again adopting a homestead provision.
It seems to me very clearly the State can require that only
Alaska residents participate in homosteading programs,
QUESTION?

What historically has been — of course,

homesteading basically — there used to be a Federal program
and it v?as for newcomers primarily, wasn't it?
MR, LORENSEM:
the land.

It was to encourage people to settle

Whether the Federal program was for newcomers or

just encourage settlement —
QUESTIONt

Has there ever been, do you know, with

respect to homesteading, whether historically there have been
residential restrictions?
MR, LORENSEN:
QUESTION5

2 really do not know that,

I don't either.

I was just asking for

information.
MR. LORENSENs

No, I don’t knew.

The State has had a mini-homesteading program in
the past for recreational provisions, but it cut that out not
too long ago.
QUESTIONt

Of course, your statute does not

preclude employment of nonresident aliens, does it — I mean
•of resident aliens.
MR, LORENSEN:
we have made.

No, it detfs not.

That is a point

Mr. flagstaff in his reply brief has somehow

37
indicated that we do not permit aliens to participate in the
program if they are residents.

That is not in fact the case.

To the extent that he makes that argument,

I am not sure what

his basis for it is.

1 would point as well that the Alaska legislature
is charged with a duty under the Alaska Constitution, Article

VIII, Section 2, to see to it that the resources of the State
of Alaska are developed and utilized fees the maximum benefit
of the people.

This provides an independent, separate

justification, separate basis for the legislature enacting
Local Hire.

It is charged with the duty under the Alaska

Constitution to maximize benefits to residents.

And this

maximizes those benefits,
QUESTION:

How from a constitutional point of view

is that an independent basis as contrasted to a legislature
simply deciding without any constitutional mandat© that it
wants to do that?
MR, LOREHSEN;

It seems to me that the constitution©

requirement places the nature of a trust upon the legislature
in its relationship with that land that may or may not exist
in the absence of that kind of a constitutional requirement,
QUESTION:

But in either case where you are being

challenged on Federal constitutional grounds ~~
MR. IORENSEN;

That's correct.

X am certainly not

asserting that the Alaska Constitution can overrule the

38

Federal Constitution.
There is soma question as to what the Alaska
Supreme Court did say about Local Hire and how it characterized
it.

1 would just like to read that to you to indicate that

it did not say that Local Hire is simply an across-the-board
economic preference to residents.
said:

The State Supreme Court

"We are hesitant to classify Alaska Hire as —QUESTION:

Where are you reading from?

MR. LQRENSEN s

I am reading from — this is the

brief of the appellants, in their footnote 7 on page 7.
It can also bs found in their jurisdictional statement in
their Appendix 1, page 19A, which contains the entire decision.
sWe are hesitant to clarify -• to classify? this
is a typo —» to classify Alaska Hire as something other than
an attempt to strengthen the Alaskan economy,"

It is an

attempt to strengthen the Alaskan economy? it is not simply
some across-the-board preference for residents.
6,Wa believe that the better alternative is to
consider Alaska Hire an economic measure justified by the
'natural resources exception,*” and then they go on into
McCready.

They do not. reject the notion that Alaska Hire was

adopted to promote either education and training in the State.
We have presented numerous affidavits to the Superior Court
indicating that training did

in fact take place to qualify

Alaska residents for these jobs as they became available. So

39
training was a vary integral part of the Alaska Hire program.
It did not operate in a vacuum.
QUESTION:

In your view of the Privileges and

Immunities Clause, would it forbid the Alaska legislature
from requiring all private employers to hire Alaskans first?
MR. LORENSEN:

I won't say that it would forbid it.

Such a requirement would not invoke the McCready principle.
The question then would foe whether or not there are under your
Toomer test for Privileges and Immunities analysis, whether
there are valid and independent reasons for the discrimination.
QUESTION:

Also assume the legislature invoked the

same reasons that it did here with respect to employment on
State property, namely, that Alaska has a high unemployment
rate and they intend to give an economic benefit to Alaskan
residents.
MR. LOREHSEN:

I would hate to express an opinion on

behalf of the Attorney General's office at this point in time
on that issue.

However, it see-ms to me that your true —

QUESTION:
just short of that.

Let me ask you something different, then,
What test do you think is applicable in

the Privileges and Immunities Clause to test a law like that?
MR. LORENSEN t

A law such as the one you are

proposing?
QUESTION s

Yes.

MR. LORENSEN:

Your Teamsr test, are there valid

40
and independent reasons for the discrimination»

I can read it

to you.
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

You raa&n, just any reason?
You mean whatever the Court meant in

Toomer?
MR. L0REN3EN:

Yes, to state it very simply.

In Toomer you articulated a very specific test.
Court articulated it.

The

It was a two-pronged issue? and the

questions went as follows:

Are there valid, independent

reasons for the disparity of treatment?

Does the degree of

discrimination bear close relation to those reasons?

And

coupled with that wan e caveat added by the Court that
indicated that your inquiry must always be conducted with due
regard to the principle that States should have considerable
leeway in analysing local evils and in prescribing appropriate
cures for them.
It's our position that if the Court does not apply
the HcCready principle to Local Hire, that that test must still
b® satisfied.

That is the applicable teat for analysing

Local Hire, and it is our position -QUESTION s

Suppose we reject your McCready principle?

You still have to face the Toomer problem*-, I guess.
MR. LGRSNSENs

That’s right, the Toomer teat.

don’t consider it a problem.
brief»

We have addressed it in our

I

41
QUESTION:

That’s why I*m asking you.

If we reject

the McCready principle, would there really be any difference
between this lav? and a law which required a preference in all
priverts employment?
MR. LQRENSEN:

Yes.

And that's where the

constitutional provision of the State Constitution comes into
play., which directs the legislature to see to it that land
v?hieh the State owns is utilized for the maximum benefit of
residents.

That constitutional mandate applies only to land

which the State owns and dees not apply to privately held land
in the State.
So there is still a valid, independent reason, and
that is that the State seeks ~QUESTXON:

It’s kind of a bootleg reason, isn't it?

MR. LORSNSEMs
QUESTIONS

Bootleg or however —

Vfell, you have a provision in your

State Constitution that says you may do this, so you must do it.
MR. LORENSENs

No.

The reason is that the State

owns this land and desires to utilize, if it’s to be utilized
at all, if It*3 to be disposed of, it desires to see to it that
it be utilized in a manner which is most beneficial to Alaska
residents.

And you can’t apply that test to private ownership,

to land which is privately owned.

The State does not have

that same interest in private land which it has in land which
it owns on behalf of its people.

42
I have only a couple of minutes left, but I would
just, like to address briefly the equal protection issues raised
by the appellants that this Court should find that nonresidency
is either a suspect classification for purposes of equal
protection analysis or that the resident-nonresident discrimina­
tion violates, impinges upon- the fundamental right to travel,
which this Court has articulated in a number of recent cases.
With respect to the suspect classification argument,
we have pointed out that this Court; has never held that non­
residency falls into that suspect classification category.

In

fact, the underlying justification for suspect classifications
which this Court has articulated in th© San Antonio Independent
School District ease that suspect classifications are recognised
where you are talking about a group* which has no independent
political power base, essentially, simply does not apply to
nonresidents x*ho can at any time go to their congressional
leaders hare in Washington and seek to get Congress to make
discrimination by any State on the basis of residence illegal.
So that nonresidents do in that case have that kind of
political option.
QUESTION:
do

Then they don51 need'the Constitution,

they?
MR. LORENSEN:
QUESTIONS

1 beg your pardon?

We don't need the Privileges and

Immunities Clause in the Constitution.

They can take care of

43
themselves.
MR, LORENSEN:
certainly not.

I’m not going to take that position,,

But it seems to me that with respect to your

concerns that thax-e not be a great many suspect classifications
created, the concerns which you have articulated as justifying
the creation, the recognition^of suspect classification, simply
do not apply to the situation of resident versus nonresident
discriminations.
Ae to the right of travel argument, this Court has
recognised the right of travel only in the context of
duration of residency requirements where the discrimination is
imposed between new residents and old residents, and the right
of travel which you have discussed in those cases is the right
to migrate, the right to actually pick up and move one's
residence from one State to another.

This Court has yet to

expand that right to travel notion to include the right to
travel casually throughout the United States.

As we have

indicated in our brief, we do feel that there are, upon
analyzing the cases, two different rights of travel which this
Court has recognised.

One is the right of migration, the right

to actually move one's residence, take up residence in a new
State.

That is what this Court has protected through its

Fourteenth Amendment analysis.
The other right is protected by the Privileges and
Immunities Clause Qf Article IV, Section 2.

44
With that I will close*
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Wagstaff, do you

have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H, WAGSTAFF
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. WAGSTAFF:

Yes, I do.

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.
There is a disagreement among the parties over what
the Alaska Suprema Court has ruled.

However, it is our position,

as I attempted to amplify to the Court in my reply brief, that
the Alas';a court rejected the legislative findings a,3 being
any sort of justification or any sort of basis for Alaska Hire
and rather found that it is simply an across--the-beard economic
preference given to Alaska residents that the State has a
right to do because it owns the resources.
The independent reasons asserted, the independent
reasons being high unemployment, ware rejected by the Supreme
Court.

But even if they are considered, they do not in and

of themselves justify discrimination against residents of other
States just because of unique problem;?, if they exist at all,
in Alaska.

Because, as I have tried to argue, every State at

least in its own ayf% has its own unique problems and unique
attributes.
QUESTION.

Mr. Wagstaff, do you think the Alaska

45
State bar can impose a residency requirement?
MR. WAGSTAFF:

It does impose a residency require­

ment, and, of course, there are cases.
recall, affirming without

This Court’s, as I

opinion the New Mexico case several

years ago indicates that it is constitutionally valid.
X personally, again, see no justification for a
residency requirement for admission to tha bar, because you
don’t have to remain a resident ones you are admitted to
practice law, at least in Alaska»

Tha theory, as I understand

it is that it gives the State Board of Bar Examiners an
opportunity to examine the person8s qualification. . If they are
actually there,

I think-a domiciliary requirement doesn't

"meet that particular need, is not necessary.

If a person is

physically present, I think that’s adequate.

But again that

holding certainly is not necessary to this particular case.
QUESTIONS

You concede that cases hold that the

residency requirement for admission to the State bar is
permissible?

MR. WAGSTAFF%

Yes, that is ona of the exceptions,

similar to tha voting, professional licensing, divorce, if you
want to think of it in those terms, possibly municipal
■'employment under the McCarthy opinion, .and receipt of welfare.
Those arcs exceptions — exceptions is perhaps the wrong word.
It’s instances where a State is- shewing a substantial
compelling and legitimate need which it has the.burden to show.

46

Of course» as I believe Mr. Justice Stevens has
suggested that a State could justify a law.like Alaska Hire
under its general regulatory powers, not simply we own it.
QUESTION s

Maybe it could and maybe it couldn’t.

But in this case» the State doesn’t seek to justify it under
any such powers, but rather only on the limited foundation
that in this case we are dealing with assets that are owned

sale or jobs or anything else.

It had nothing to do with

It was just whethar or not

the State can restrict access to its own residents.
QUESTION:

Mr. flagstaff.

MR. WAGSTAFF:
QUESTION s

Yes.

Earlier in your argument you emphasised

the fact that the employment here was private.
Alaska undorfccok to perform all of its function

Assume that
that it now

leases out, that is, drilling the oil or gas and constructing
and operating pipelines, perhaps a refinery, so that the
people employed would foe employees directly of the state.
Would that make a difference to your position?
MR. WAGSTAFF:

It's a different case.

that's the state employment issue.

Of course,

S still believe that those

circumstances would foe a violation of the Privileges and
Immunities Clause,

I don't think the public employment or

— not the public employment? the public contracting, public
works doctrine should foe any longer valid.

The Heim and Crane

48
theory of employment on public works, X think, has been
rejected by this Court.

So 1 think if they are contractors,

it seems to m© under existing law, if they are contractors in
which the Stata has an interest or is hiring directly, then
under existing law it would be a violation of privileges
and immunities,
QUESTION:

In McCarthy we were dealing with

employees of th3 city of Philadelphia as I recall.
MR. WAGSThFF:
QUESTION:

Correct.

Would you draw a distinction between

city employees on the one hand performing public functions and
employees of Alaska in the example I gave you?
MR. W&GSTAFFs
was involved with fireman.

yes, I certainly do.

McCarthy

It was a per curiam decision.

There are other articulable reason© for municipal employment
justifications, such as knowing, as in the firemen's case
or policemen's case, knowing what the city is like, having a
feel for the people in the city, things of that nature, that
are different and additional reasons *

With an

employee, those reasons simply do not exist.
QUESTION:
opinion.

You said McCarthy was a per curiam

Is that one- of the distinctions you would draw?
MR. WAGSTAFP:

I said that, in the sens® that that

was .act fully analysed, as X recall, in the particular opinion
as to the specific reasons for municipal employment.

49
QUESTION:

It was a summary disposition, which is

why it was per curiam.
QUESTION:

You feel, thereforer it is lass

authoritative?
MR. WAGSTAFF:

In my judgment, it is, in trying to

seek guidance from it. The fact that it was not argued and was
a per curiam opinion does carry less weight with me as an
attorneyo
QUESTION:

As a matter of fact, I think we suggested

that perhaps summary decisions are less authoritative even
for us.
MR, WAGSTAFF:
QUESTION:

Yes, that’s correct.

Not even for us.

QUESTION:

Especially for us.

QUESTION:

Mo,.

MR. WAGSTAFF*

For us, but not for others.,
I see my time is up.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case la submitted*
(Whereupon, at 11:13 a.m., oral argument in the
above-entitled matter was concluded.)
