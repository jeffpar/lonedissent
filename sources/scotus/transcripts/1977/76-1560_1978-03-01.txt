ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN

r

ESQ.?

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FRIEDMAN;

Mr, Chief Justice and may it please,

the Court;
The principal question in this criminal antitrust
case? where is here under writ of certiorari to the Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit? is whether sellers who
concertedly exchange among themselves information with respect
t» the current prices at which they are selling and other
competitive natters

,

conduct that would otherwise violate

section 1 of the Sherman Act? may justify this conduct on
the ground that the information they are seeking from their
competitors would be helpful to them in establishing a meeting
competition defense under section 2(b) of the Robinson-Patman
Act as a defense to a charge that might b© brought against
them of price discrimination,
QUESTION; When you say the principal question pre­
sented? you mean the questions presented by the petition for
certiorari?

e2

MR„ FRIEDMAN;

By our petition, yes.

That’s the

main issue, the main focus in this Court, and the reason for
QUESTION;

You say the main focus in this Court,

don’t you have a feeling that if this had been a Dyer Act case
the Third Circuit would have affirmed on -the basis of harmless
error with an instruction like this?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

I don’t know, Mr, Justice,

But let me explain the reason I say it’s the
principal case,

In addition to this issue, a single judge on

the Court of Appeals, two of them, each individually found
three other grounds for reversing this conviction in the
instructions„
One of th© judges thought that the instructions were
defective in two respects, because they failed to specify what
was necessary to be shown in order to establish the participa­
tion of particular defendants in the conspiracy, and also
that the instructions were deficient on withdrawal from the
conspiracy.
Another judge, although not agreeing with those two
rules, thought that th© jury had coerced a verdict.
So that what you hav® in this case is the RobinsonPatman Act issue concurred in by two judges of -the Court of
Appeals, other criminal lav/ rulings concurred in by only

one judge of the Court, but the two single judges together
ended up with a majority that would have resulted in reversal
apart from the Robinson-Patman Act, question»
The indictment in this case, which was returned
in December 1937, charged six corporations that manufactured
gypsum board and ten of their individual officers with having
conspired from before 1960 until the return of the* indictment,
in violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act, to fix, raise,
maintain and stabilize prices of gypsum board, to fix,
maintain and stabilize the terms &nd‘ conditions of sals and
to adopt uniform methods of handling and packaging»
Two of the corporations and seven of the
individuals pleaded nolo contendere.
After a 19-week trial, the jury convicted th© four
remaining corporations and the three individual officers of
those corporations who are the respondents now before this
Court,
I would just like to say a word about th© gypsum
board industry itself, because -the character of tee industry
is significant with respect to tee issues involved in this
case,
The gypsum board has largely replaced plaster as
tee major mafeg^i&i used for the interior walls of buildings.
The gypsum board, tee standard board produced by all manu~

5
6
facturers is th© same, you can't; tell one from the other.
And the result of this is that the competition, among manuf&ctu.r
®r3 of gypsum board is not to stress quality but rather price,
discounts, and service.
The product is a heavy product, which means that
shipping coste are expensive, and it's difficult to serve a
very large area from a parti.cular plant.
plants throughout the country.

The respondents have

The industry is also highly

concentrated.
During the period covered by this indictment, the
four corporate respondente had 75 percent of national sales9
they being the four largest in the industry.

The eight largest

in the industry had a total of 94 percent of the industry,
Th© remaining 6 percent of the industry was held by seven
firms of the so-called single-plant producers, a firm that
had only one plant and, of necessity, would serve a much
smaller geographical area than -the larger companies could serve
These companies came into existence in the 19509s and
1960 s, and on® of the charges in our complaint, which we
believe the record supports, is that part of th© defendant’s
conspiracy involved predatory practices directed ©.gainst the
single producers.
The indictment charged that th© defendants had
utilized a number of different means for effectuating the
conspiracy. And the on© that was most litigated in this case

6
7

was a practice -chat the defendants referred to as verifica­
tion.
Under this practice, when an official at the head­
quarters of one of the companies was informed from the field
that a customer had been quoted a lower price by a competitor,
he verified with the company that was reported as giving this
price.

If the other company denied giving the price, then

they normally would not need it.

If, however, the other

company acknowledged giving the price, than the usual but
not the invariable practice was for the first company to meat
that price.
The product was sold at a list price with a discount.
Th© list prices throughout the period were

virtually

identical by all th© manufacturers and the discussion of
verification related primarily to th© discounts that; were
being given off these prices.
QUESTIONs

If that's all the record showed, what

would be your position?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

Just if ~ if ‘that's all you had,

what w© would say, that the verification alone, the verifica—

tion alone in the circumstances of this — well, if that's all
they did, if all they were doing was verifying, that's all
that was shown, that would not, in our view, be a violation of
section —
QUESTION;

How about verifying and than meeting the

8

7

p ri c© c utte r ?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

And then that: would

meeting the

cutter, that would begin to get. more,
QUESTION:

Begin, but would it be a crime?

MR, FRIEDMAN:

I couldn’t state without knowing more

facte, I think, Mr» Chief Justice.

But, and this w© think is

the critical thing, in this case the charge was, and the jury
by its verdict must have found, that verification if done
with either the purpose or -the effect of fixing prices would
be enough to violate the Sherman Act-.
That’s our — the case is not limited just to the
mere act of the verification, because there’s a lot. mora»
Let ms add two things in addition to the verification
it was not only with respect to prices, it was also with
respect to various terms and conditions of sale.

For example,

they would call to ask whether somebody was giving greater
credit terms than they were giving»

In some instances they

called to ask -whether firms were trucking the product to the
elastomer, because trucking is more convenient if it’s
delivered right to your plant than if you have to pick

it up

at the railsiding0
And there were instances in which the inquiry
related not just to what was being don© with respect to a.
specific customer, but more broadly: . what were you doing in
a particular city?

Is it true you were doing certain things

in Texas?

And so on.
The. primary justification that the respondents

offered for this practice was that they say the need to comply
with the Robinson-Patman Act„

Now , the Robinson-Patman Act,

of course, prohibits generally discriminations in price whose
effect may be substantially to lessen competition.
It provides a limited exception in 2(b), which says
that a person charged with discrimination may justify it by
showing that he gave the lower discriminatory price in a goodfaith attempt to meet the equally low price of a competitor.
The respondents also contended that they needed to
engage in this practice in order to protect themselves against
what they call customer fraud.

The customer fraud, as they

see it, being that a customer misrepresented to them that the
customer was getting a lower offer from on© of the competitors.
But at the trial there were a number of admissions
that at least on© purpose of this verification was to minimize
price competition.

As one officer of United States Gypsum

stated, he said, "I was attempting to minimize deviations from
list price*»

That’s at page 501 of ‘the record.

Described as

another method of keeping prices up, at page 519? to keep
market stability, to guard against price erosion.
One of these single-plant producers joined in this
conspiracy.

He did so after he had attended the first

meeting of the Gypsum Association, the trad© association, at

9
10

which Respondent Watt, -the executive vice president of U, S,
Gypsum Company, said there were certain things that went on
in the gypsum industry. Specifically he talked about the
exchange of price information and the need to be honest»

And

this man stated that after he had been -bold that, the reason
h© engaged in verification was, and this is at 205 of the
record, "the price in our prime market was rapidly deteriorating
and my motive was to try to keep it from deteriorating any
further» ”
Now, during the time of this •—
QUESTION:

Mr» Friedman, what part of idle instruction

is this part of your argument devoted to?
Because there — or is it devoted to something other
than the instructions?
MR„ FRIEDMAN:

No, it’s devoted to the basic

question of whether an agreement, a price exchange agreement,
teat has -tile effect of fixing or stabilising prices may be
justified because of a purpose to comply with the Robinson-»
Patanan Act»

And our

argument on that score primarily is

that because of this exchange of prices tends to facilitate
price maintenance, price stabilization and price fixing, to
permit this would create a serious loophole in the Sherman
Act, and this is designed to show that the defendants themselves
at least recognized, and to show what one of tea purposes was.
QUESTION: The Court of Appeals didn’t hold teat there

10

11

wasn't; substantial evidence to support the verdict, did it?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No»

No, it's unclear

exactly what

the Court of Appeals held» The Court of Appeals held that
there was evidence to support a finding that this was their
purpose, and it's rather cryptic whether it also held that
that was the effect. But presumab3.y, sine© it remanded for a
new trial under the different instruction the Court of Appeals
thought necessary, that it must have believed that on

the

proper instruction a finding of effect would be sustainable.
QUESTION:

Mr. Friedman, what is the period of the

alleged conspiracy?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

From the beginning -— prior to 1960

until the return of the indictment in December 1973.
QUESTION:

You have a statute of limitations that

operates somewhere in there, don't you?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes. There's a five-year statute, so

the cutoff date is, I think it's December 27th, something
like that, —
QUESTION;

Of '68?

MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

Of "68,

My impression from your statement of

facts, which I think is about 40-odd pages long, is that most
of the facts you talk about occurred before the period involved
in the indictment.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Most of them did, Mr. Justice! but we

11

12

have also explained in our brief that: there was evidence that
the conduct continued into the limitations period. And of
course if the conspiracy was underway before the limitations
period, as long as acts were done in furtherance of the
conspiracy during the limitations period, that, is enough to
establish a violations
But there was some continuing activity, some verifica­
tion, various other idlings, some price maintenance during the
period of the —
QUESTION:

The verification practice after 1968 was

at a very substantially lower level, as I gather from —
MR» FRIEDMAN: That is undoubtedly correct.
But I think

one thing I may just mention in

connection with the verification practice that is rather
interesting, the major reason that was suggested ‘they needed
to engage in verification was so they could protect themselves
for a meeting competition defense if they were charged with
price discrimination»

But they kept no records at all of

these communications, they kept no records, indeed there were
policies not to keep records»

.And when one man was asked,

"Well, if you needed this in order to protect yourself, to
establish a Robinson-Patman meeting competition deafens©, why
didn’t you keep any records?"

He said, "Well, I can’t really

answer to that, it just didn't seem necessary»"
So I think that again is illustrative of the dangers

12
13
in this kind of thing®
Nov;, during the period in November and December 1965,
following the lead of U, S, Gypsum, all of the respondents
announced that they were giving up discounting,,

They were all

going to sell at list prices, identical list prices.
for a year and a half to two years this happened.

And

And despite

the fact that they were not giving any discounts at this
period, they still continued to verify.
And -tli© lack of discounting and the increased prices
took place at. a time when there was a decrease in demand for
the product and over-capacity.
The court gave a lengthy charge to fee jury, and
explained at length the Robinson-Patman Act and what the
meeting competition defense involved.

Now, what the court

told the jury was that they could convict the defendants if
they found either a purpose to fix and stabilize prices or that
the effect of what the defendants had don®, was to fix or
stabilize prices, and it said that if the effect of such
exchanges was to fix — raise, fix, maintain or stabilize
prices, then an agreement to engage in such an exchange is a
violation of the Sherman Act, regardless of the specific purpose
that th© parties to the agreement had in mind.

It was that

instruction that the majority of the Court of Appeals held was
erroneous„
QUESTION s Was this th© same instruction as on page

Id

14
13a of the Petition?

"If you decide that the effect of these

exchanges was to raise, fix, maintain, and stabilize the price
..then you may consider -these exchanges as evidence. .11
MR. FRIEDMAN? Well, no, it went beyond that. That
was til© first; part of the instruction, Mr, Justice, But over
at page .1722 of the record, after., they gave' that instruction,
the court charged?

"If the effect of such exchanges” -- and

this is about five lines down — "was ts raise, fix, maintain
or stabilise prices, then an agreement to engage in such an
exchange is a violation of the Sherman Act, regardless of the
specific purpose that the parties to the agreement, had in
their minds."
And then it goes on in the next paragraph:

"The

effect o.o, then the partl.es „ <,, are presumed, as a matter of
law, to have intended that, resulto”
So the court charged the jury that they could convict,
if they found that the

effects of this

first, that they

had to find if there was an agreement, and if they found there
was an agreement, if they found that the effect of this
agreement was to raise, maintain or stabilize prices, that
was enough to establish a violation of section 1 of the
Sherman Act.
QUESTION: So you’re picking out a part of the
instructions that the Third Circuit didn’t really deal with,
that’s less favorable to the government, and saying — or the

14

15

instruction is more favorable to the government, and arguing
that that should be sustained here»
MRc FRIEDMANS
Appeals

Well, no, I think the Court of

had fairly read it, its opinion said — it varied in

different places, but what it fairly said was that if the
sol© purpose of this verification was to protect — concerned
their defense under the Robinson-Patman Act, then that would
not be a basis for finding a violation of section 1»

I think

that's wh&t the Court of Appeals held.
And the dissenting opinion by Judge Weis in the
Court of Appeals concluded that the instructions properly
stated the law,
QUESTION;

Of course the trial judge's instructions

also said that if the sole purpose was good faith, the
compliance with the Robinson-Patman Act is no violation,
/

MR„ FRIEDMAN:

No, Mr, Justice, he says if the sol©

purpose was good-faith compliance, there was no violation
unless —- unless it had the affect of fixing, maintaining or
stabilizing prices,

I believe that’s it.

The instruction is

somewhat cryptic, but I think that when you read it all
together you see what he was telling — if you find they
had the purpose of fixing, stabilizing prices, 'then that's bad.
If you find they had no purpose, but no adverse effect, then
it would b© all right.

But if you found that it had an

adverse effect without regard to the purpose, that was enough

15

16

to —
QUESTION: Well, his first instructi.on says, "If you
decide"

— this is on 1721 — "that, this was merely done in a

good faith effort to comply with the Robinson-Patman Act,
then you could not consider verification, standing alone, as
establishing an agreement to fix, raise, maintain, and stabilis®
prices as charged,"
He says in words, as I read them, that if they found
compliance with the Robinson-Patman Act to b© the sol©
motive, there's no -- that's the end of the case»
MRo FRIEDMAN: Well, no, but he said you couldn't
consider verification standing alone? ~
QUESTION: Right,.
MR0 FRIEDMAN:

— as establishing an agreement®

But we had more than just verification in this case.
But then he went on to say, "if you decide that the
effect, of these exchanges was" — in the next sentence — "to
fix, maintain, and stabilize prices, then you may consider
l

these changes as evidence of the mutual agreement or under­
standing alleged in the indictment to raise, fix, maintain, and
stabilize list prices»"
I think it's —
QUESTION: So you think that's to be understood as
instructing the jury even if the sol© purpose of the verifica­
tion was to establish a defense under Robi©son~Patman, if indeed

16

a violation if *—

it to be more favorable to your opponents than the actual
language is.

QUESTION:

It was even more extravagant then that»

The foreman of the jury reported to the court here that
literally some of the jurors were ready to jump out the
window»
MR„ FRIEDMAN: Well, I think what -QUESTION:

Do you think that was a little hyperhole?

MRo FRIEDMAN;

I think so.

What he said was there

was on© woman who was at the window, and he thought maybe she
was going to jump out.

But ~~

[Laughter * 3
MRo FRIEDMAN:

— I don't think he said that* And

it's clear that soma of the
QUESTION:

~-

Maybe she was just climbing the walls*

[Laughter o 3
MRo FRIEDMAN:

Well, that's not unusual, Mr»

Justice, with a long case and a complicated, difficult case --QUESTION:

You don't have to tell me!

MR0 FRIEDMAN;
defendantso
of them*

— a lot of facts, there were seven

You have to evaluate -the evidence against each

It's something to try the tempers of, I think, all

people.
Now, let me come to that issue in the case, which
is whether you can justify an agreement

exchanging prices

that would otherwise violate section 1 of the Sherman Act,
because you say you need and want this information in order

18
19
to establish a meeting competition defense under the RobinsonP&tman Act,
Exchanges of price information occupy a peculiar
place in the learning of this Courts There have been cases
which have upheld them, there have been cases which have
turned them dovjj? so that the exchange of price information was
not permissibleo
But I think the on© thread that runs through all of
these cases and culminates in this Court"s decision nine
years ago in -the Container case was that an exchange of current
prices, which is what this was, which they were offering to a
particular customer, that an exchange of current prices
violates the Sherman Act if either its purpose or its effect
was to fix or stabilize or maintain prices„
QUESTION:

Do you read Container as being unanimous

in that respect?
MR, FRIEDMAN s

I do, Mr, Justice, because the

dissenting opinion in Container specifically refers two or
three times and said they didn't think in that case the
government had established either the purpose or the intent to
stabilize or fix prices.
QUESTION:

I think --

Or effect.

MR0 FRIEDMAN:

Or #;ffect0

I'm sorry, either to©

purpose or effect.
I think the disagreement between toe. majority and the

19
20

minority was over what the government had proved in the case,
not over the guiding legal standards.
And I think this principi® reflecte the economic
realities of what happens when you have this kind of an.
exchange of price information..
There is very little incentive for one firm to cut
its prices if it knows that as soon as it does so its opponent,
its competitors will know about it, because, as soon as it's
reported by a customer that the price has been cut, the sales­
man, wanting to make the sale, will try to g©t approval from the
horn© office to make the cut, h© will have to say who the
competi.tor was that gave the price.

The firm getting this

request will get in touch with the other firm to see whether
they did it.
Well, this, it seems to me — and correspondinglyf
you know teat if you ar© giving them price information, they
&r@ giving you price informationi it seems to ro© this removes
a great deal of the incentive for engaging in price competition,
foecaus® price competition is effective ~ is effective when
what you have is the first price and it’s tried to be done
secretly.

If your costs remain relatively steady, the only

reason to cut a price is in the hop© of gaining later volume,
You make up in your volume what you los© in tee individual
sal®, But if you know teat everyone is going to follow suit,
it's no great incentive to do this,

20

21
And similarly, this kind of verification of prices

is & very effective method of policing an agreement to fix
prices, because you know -that if you deviate from the agreement
you will be caught up on it very quickly, and “the record shows
numerous instances where that kind of thing happened»
Now, th© Container case we think is very close to
'this case»

There you had a similar situation that the

companies reciprocally exchanged their most recent prices on
sales to specific customers»

Without even considering the

purpose of this arrangement, the court held that this arrange­
ment was illegal price-fixing because it said it stabilised
prices, though at a downward level0

The inferences are

irresistible, that the exchange of price information has had
an. <321 ti-competitive effect in tha industry, chilling the vigor
of price competitiono
The Court, of Appeals decision, and respondents5
argument in this case as to why they should have this exception
rests on two words, literally two words, in the Container
opinion»

Th© opinion in Container began by explaining why 'this

case is unlike any other price decisions w© have rendered,
•and then it distinguished Container from other cases, and it
distinguished, among other cases, th© Cement Manufacturers
case which .had upheld an exchange of price information» And
it noted that while both cases involved an exchange of prices
to specific customers, there was absent the controlling circum-

21
22
stances viz , the Cement. Manufacturers price ax change were
designed to protect against fraud.
And the Court of Appeals and the respondente urged
that because this Court, in distinguishing the case, used the
words "controlling circumstance", this amounts to a recognition
of an exception to the general rule condoning the exchange of
price information that has an adverse effect on competition;
if there is a controlling circumstance, -that will justify an
exception. And then they go on and say, and her® w© have a
different, another controlling circumstance, the wish to
protect themselves from being charged with price discrimina"*
tion under' the Robinson-Patman Act,
QUESTION:

Well, also, wasn't there til© same sort of

— the same controlling circumstance as in Cement, i„e«, to
protect against customer fraud?
MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, that w© think is — it’s a
different type of customer fraud, Mr, Justice Stewart»
QUESTION:

Here the assertion is that it was to

protect against being misinformed by a customer that a
compatitor had given him a lower price,
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes.

Yes.

QUESTION: What was the customer fraud in Cement?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

In Cement, the customer fraud was *■—•

they had an arrangement whereby they would permit people to
get a product at a lower price during the duration, when th@y

22
23

were going “bo increase the price -—
QUESTIONS

Oh, during the protection period, yes,

and they had over —
MRU FRIEDMAN s

Prots’.ction period„

And the purpose

of the exchange in Cement was to enable a firm to be. protected
against having to ship — the concern was the shipment. Where
here the concern was to find out whether a similar arrangement
was being offered by a competitor,.
Now, we don't think that that statement in Container
can fairly be read as creating this kind of an exception»
was just the words that the Court happened to use*

It

The Court

could have equally said, instead of saying that that case —
theaewas absent, instead of the controlling circumstance, it
was absent the fact that»

If the Court had said that, which

would have been the identical statement, there wouldn't be any
basis for this
QUESTION: Well, they had a fact doctrine, then»
MR„ FRIEDMAN: What?
QUESTION:

It's not an unusual experience for a rn m,

any member of this Court, to casually use a phrase in an opinion
and it comes back a year or two later as a doctrine»
MRc FRIEDMAN:

That's right. We don't —

[Laughter»]
QUESTION:

Or a test»

QUESTION:

Right

23
24

MR. FRIEDMANS
what's Container said,

We don't think fch&i; that's fairly
I think you've got to look and see

what Container held,.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR, FRIEDMAN;

What Container held was that the

exchange of price information there» similar to that that you
have her©» was illegal price tampering or price fixing» price
stabilization under the Sherman Act, because of its effect
upon prices — because of its effect on prices.
There's nothing in the Robinson-Patman Act that
says that in order to establish your good faith in giving a
discriminatory lower price» to show that it was dons in good
faith to meet the equally low price of a competitor» you've
got to check with the competitor to find out how much he is
charging0
The Federal Trade Commission does not take that
position» there8s attached to our petition a letter they sent
us advising that» and we know of no court cases that take that
position»
The rule that the Court of Appeals — the principle
that the Court of Appeals has announced» and the principles
b

which respondents are arguing here, it seems to us» would cut
a very wide gap in -the Sherman Act, because it's not

difficult

for people who want to facilitate the maintenance of prices to
say they have to do it in order to protect themselves against

24

25
protect themselves from a, possible charge under the

Robinson-P&tnan Act.,

Of course, the Robins on-Patman Act —

they talk about meeting the requirements of the, 2(b) of
the Robinson-Patman Acfc„ The Robinson-Patman Act, the only
requirements of the Robinson-Patman Act are -that you can't
discriminate in price where it has anti-competitive effects,
2(b) is a limited exception to that defense, it’s a defense
recognizing a specific situation? but it's never been thought,
it seems to me, that in order to take advantage of a defense
like that, you can justify something that otherwise would
violate another statute,
And that is precisely what happens in this case,
because the claim is that ©van ‘though this thing has the
prohibited effect upon competition, even though this exchange
had th© effect of stabilizing the prices, nevertheless they
can justify it because they want this information in order to
defend against -the possible charge of price discrimination.
Now, the argument has bean made here that to subject
th© respondents to conviction for this conduct amounts to a
prohibited retroactive application of a new rule of law,
we don't think there's any new rule of law that was applied
by the district court in this case. We think, as I've indicated,
th© principles governing this field are well settled, and
all the district court did was to tell the' jury to apply these
principles to the facts ©f this case.

25

26

So in this aspect of the case we think that —*
QUESTION:

Mr. Friedman, before you leave this

aspect of the case, in Judge Hunter's opinion at pages 28 and
29 of the cert petition, he summarizes what he thinks would be
& proper instruction, which was not quit© given.

Would you

say that that instruction, had it been given, would have
been wrong?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes,

We would say that that instruc­

tion -- teat we5 re challenging teat instruction. That instruc­
tion would have been wrong, we think, because w© don't think
that if they engage in tee practice solely to comply with the
strictures of the Robinson-Patman Act, even subject to the
other qualifications, that teat would be a justification.
Our position is that you cannot justify an exchange
of price information that has the effect of fixing prices, and
because, if you wish, even solely comply with the Robins onPatman Act.

We would not accept that.

In fact, that's what

the holding, I suppose, of the Court of Appeals is, and that's
the holding we're challenging.
That gives a — that holding is a narrower rule
than the respondents urge, but even teat rule, in our opinion,
is wrong.
QUESTION:

Mr„ Friedman, before you go on, if there

is verification practiced widely, as it was in this case, and
it does not result in stabilizing prices, I take it you wouldn’t

26
27

complain of that:?
MR, FRIEDMAN:

Wo, if it — in other words, if I may

rephrase the question, Mr» Justice, if we assume that the
exchange of prices did not adversely affect competition,
price-to-pric© level, if there were mere exchange of prices,
we would not question that; and indeed tills Court in many of
its decisions recognized that a mere exchange of prices
itself is not illegal, indeed it may be very useful in some
situation if it gets ~~
QUESTIONi

In an industry like this one where you

stated at the outset that price is stabilized because of the
nature of the commodity and trie nature of the industry, how
does this work out in practice?

If you're a businessman, what

do you do?
MRo FRIEDMAN;

Well, it's stabilized through list

prices, but what they’re trying to do is prevent and eliminate
the discounting»

That’s the problem, it seems to me*

I think if I’m selling at list price, and a customer
comes to me and says a competitor is offering me a lower price,
I have to decide whether I want to cut the price on that sale
or not*

I can't check with my competitors, I can make the

best judgment — the best judgment I can make on the basis of
everything I know*

For example, is ‘this customer reliable?

How reliable is the salesman?
QUESTION;

Is this the first

I think — I don’t think the

Sherman Act permits that kind of direct consultation between
competitors over the price they’re going to charge where it's
a widespread practice and where it has the effect that, the
jury must have found in this case.
QUESTION:

What if -- Mr, Friedman, I want to be

sure that I understand your answer to ray brother Powell’s
question — what if the avowed and acknowledge, proven purpose
of the exchange of information was to stabilise prices, but
that the effort was unsuccessful and the effect was not

prices were not stabilised? would -that not be a conspiracy
and a violation?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That would be a violation if there was

an agreement and if the purpose was to stabilise prices,

MR, FRIEDMAN: Even though wholly unsuccessful.

It would still b© a violation, wouldn’t

it?

It would still b© a violation.

Then I misunderstood your answer t-o my

brother Powell»
MR0 FRIEDMAN;

I’m sorry»

QUESTION; Well, Mr» Friedman, why shouldn't the
significance of the effect on prices be merely evidence of an
agreement to affect prices?
MR» FRIEDMAN;

Well, it is, it is one element, it is

one element,

to set prices, or to affect prices?

I would think if —

Yes, but you should go through the litany

and say, if there’s an agreement to exchange price information
and then there's an effect on prices, do you say then as a
matter of law that it must be concluded that -there is an
agreement to fix prices?

I would think that is for the jury to

more to it than just saying that you hav© to have an agreement

I'm put-ting it in these terms is because of the

what we

think is the error of the Court of Appeals holding, that without

th© purpose was merely to offer a defense under the RobinsonPatman Act, then that would be sufficient to justify the

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. McSweeney.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF Wa DONALD McSWEENEY, ESQ.f
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. McSWEENEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I am going to deal with the Robins on-Patman
verification point, as described by Mr. Friedman, including
retroactivity? Mr, DaLon© is going to address himself to the
other instructions, namely the one which Judge Hunter found a
reversible error on scope and purpose, the instruction on
scop© and purpose, and th© abandonment; and he will also
deal with th© question of th© coercion of th© jury,
Mr. Bartlit thereafter will address himself to some
of ‘the issues affecting -the individuals.
I would say at the outset, if I may, to Your Honors
that the question, her© is of course a very important one, and
more important than ©v©r in this criminal case, because any
rule fashioned by this Court will b© applicable now in felony
cases, sine© December 1974, a Sherman Act violation is a
felony; and I say that because I want to emphasize, if I may,
that it’s very important, I think, to retain the lav; which is
that in a price exchange case, even where the price exchange
has an effect of stability, the ©ismsnt of purpose in exchanging

31
32

prices should not; be emasculated, and that's what was done
in th© —QUESTION:

But I just asked the Solicitor General

here if the effect just is the intxument or the vehicle or the
evidence of a conspiracy to set prices,
MR, McSWEENEY: Well —
QUESTION:

And if it’s a conspiracy to set prices,

it’s purposeful,
MR, McSWEENEY:

If there is, Mr, Justice Whit®, a

conspiracy, a direct agreement, so to speak, to fix prices,
h© doesn’t need to show 'th© effect? but in this case there
was no direct agreement to fix price, there was only -QUESTION: Well, would you say it would be —- ’that a
jury verdict — if a jury is told that you must find a
conspiracy to set prices, which means purposeful agreement,
if you must find that, that then it’s instructed that you may
but you need not find it, if you find an agreement to exchange
information plus an effect upon prices?

Nov;, was that -—

if a jury then finds the defendants guilty, would you say
that should be upset?
MR, McSWEENEY:

Mr, Justice White, if the jury has

the option so that it could have found the defend,ant guilty
on ‘the basis of merely an exchange of prices and price
stability, that is error which should be upset? that is what
happened here.

32

33

The jury *— the government concedes that,
QUESTIONs

You said they can't ©vsn us© it as a

basis for inference?
MR, McSWEENEY:

No, they could use price stability

as a, basis of an inference, but they must find they could
infer a purpose, which is what I think this Court did in the
Container case, from price stability and an

exchange of

pricing information,
QUESTION: So you say those two facts aren't enough
•bo infer, from which a jury could infer a conspiracy to set
prices?
MR, McSWEENEY:

Mr, -Justice White, exactly, and that,

is the central point of this verification issue,
QUESTION: Right,
MR, McSWEENEY:

In this case that's what -- we

don't know what the jury found, and the government shouldn't
b@ talking about what it proved, this isn't a sufficiency ©f
the evidence case, it's here on instructions,
QUESTION; Well, you don't think the jury here was
instructed to find the defendants guilty if they found an
effect on prices, do you?
MR, McSWEENEY:

Mrc Justice White, I'm confident

that the jury here was absolutely instructed if they found
an. exchange of price information and price stability, they
must find that that would, be a violation of the Sherman. Act,

33
34
QUESTION;

"must" or "may"?

MR3 McSWEENEY;

That they could find that on that

basis.
QUESTION;

Yes, but that's "may"»

MR, McSWEENEY:

Y©s, that is "may",,

QUESTION: Well, were they required to find it or not?
MR, McSWEENEY:

They were not required, they were

— but. they were not ~~ they were told to disregard purpose
entirely.

And if I may quote the instructions, and quoting

from page 1722 of the record, which is a little bit in the
charge after, I believe, the portion that Mr, Justice Stevens
referred to, down to the paragraph which begins on that
page, to those critical words, "regardless of the specific
purpose”,

very

clearly the trial court said to the jury:

"You don't have to be concerned with the purpose of complying
with the Robinson-Patm&n Act if you find an exchange of
prices and price stability, then you may find", and that's only
— that is what the case is her© on, because, as you know, the
government concedes —
QUESTION; There's on© thing you omit, though.

He

did in that paragraph also require that there be an agreement
to exchange the information,
MR, McSWEENEY:

Right, an agreement to exchange ‘the

information, <and it seems to me
QUESTION:

Then h© says, if there is that plus the

34
35
effect, then they can infer purpose.
MR* McSWEENEY:

Yes, he instructed — no, he says,

"regardless of the purpose", Your Honor, he doesn’t — I-lr»
Justice Stevens, h® doesn’t require them to find purpose*
That's the error of that .instruction.
QUESTIONi Well, let’s read the whole paragraph:
"You see, a conspiracy to fix prices doesn't have to b© success­
ful to be unlawful, if there was such a tiling."
conspiracy*

Namely the

"If the: effect of such exchanges was to raise,

fix, maintain or stabilize prices, then an agreement to engage
in such an exchange is a violation of the Sherman Act, regard­
less of the specific purpose that the parti.es to the agreement
had in their minds."

So he's surely talking about agreement*

MR. McSWEENEY:

He's talking, though, only about an

agreement to exchange prices, but not an agreement to fix
prices.
QUESTION:

Okay.

But it's the agreement — the

question, as I understand it, is whether the agreement to
exchange prices, which had an adverse effect on the price
level, is enough to prove a violation.
MR. McSWEENEY:

Isn't that the issue?

Mr. Justice Stevens, and which
*•

relates back to 'the exchange of prices, I don't

it's the

exchange of price information which has the stabilizing
effect.
is --

Whether the exchange is an agreement or not, this

35

36

QUESTION 5 Well, tills is the paragraph you contend
was erroneous, though; this paragraph of the instructions'?
MR* McSWEENEY:

Yes, that is —

QUESTION:

Not the one that Judge Hunter relied on.

QUESTION;

Well, if they had left off the last five

words, you'd b© satisfied with it?

Five or six words, about

purposeo
MR. McSWEENEY;

I'm sorry, I don't understand

that»

QUESTION; Well, the last, five or six words that
Justice Stevens just read to you, in that instruction-

About

purpose.
MR. McSWEENEY;

oh,

the "Act does not require a

specific purpose to restrain trade", that's Hie error.

If

you left that off, it might have been all right.
QUESTION;

Might have been or would have been?

MR. McSWEENEY;

If the instruction ~

QUESTION; Would you be attacking it if he left *—
MR. McSWEENEY; Well, as he said earlier, Mr. Chief
Justice, "regardless of the specific purpose", I would
still be attacking it because of course I must read the whole
thing, because that's what the jury heard, Mr. Chief Justice.
And h© clearly from 'this instruction instructed that purpose
in a price exchange information case was not an element.
And that’s error.
The government hare concedes, if you'll note at

36

37

the government brief, page 72, in footnote 67, it says "the
verdict must be treated as if it stood entirely on the jury's
conclusion -Shat, the information exchange affected prices"»
"That the information exchange affected prices,"
Nov/, that’s not the way they charged us in the
indictment, and that I will come to in my point, -that the
charge had a variance, the instructions to the jury varied
from the charge in the indictment; that's not the way the case
was tried below.
to the jury,

That’s not the way the prosecutor argued it

He was tailing they had to find a purpose, but

the court s&id "You don’t have to find a purpose".

So -the

fault, although v/e don’t know from the general verdict what
was proved, we must as surae that the jury could have convicted
us on the basis of an exchange of price information and price
stability»
QUESTION: Could you look at the third paragraph
of Idle instruction of the petitioner, on page 13a, which is a
part of the Court of Appeals opinion, beginning, "However, if
you decide that the effect of the exchanges was to raise,
fix, maintain, and stabilize the price of gypsum w&llboard,
then you may consider these exchanges as evidence of the mutual
agreement or understanding alleged in the indictment to raise,
fix, maintain and stabilize list pricesa”
Do you -think that’s an erroneous statement of the
law?

37
38

MR» McSWEENEY:

I think they may consider»

They

have to find a purpose»
QUESTION: Well, Judge Hunter said they couldn't
H© said that was an erroneous statement, didn’t he?
MRo McSWEENEY: Well, I think what the Court of
Appeals found to be erroneous was the omission, from the charge
of the necessary element of purpose in the exchange of price
information.

That's the error here»

QUESTION: Wei.}., the instruction to which my brother
Rehnquist has just referred to, told the jury that they could
infer purpose from the exchange and from the effect of the
exchange, if th© effect was to stabilize prices, then they
could infer purpose..

That’s, in short, what this instruction

says, isn’t it?
MR» McSWEENEY:

I think if — yes, I think it does»

I think if they can — I think that ■— I’m not arguing that
purpose cannot be inferred from price information exchanges
and resulting stability»

But they must determine there was

purpose,
QUESTION:

Yes0

QUESTION: So you wouldn’t — if the jury were
properly instructed that they must find a purposeful agreement,
to set prices, and then said, "but you may, but you needn’t,
infer such an illegal conspiracy from an agreement to exchange
prices plus stability", and the jury cam© back with a

38

39

verdict, and that’s all the facts there were, would you think
the jury was —* would the verdict stand up?

Would -there be

enough evidence to sustain that verdict?
MRo McSWEENEY:

I think the jury should be told

you have to find purpose in an exchange of price information
in order to —- in a pries information exchange —
QUESTION:

Well, assume they were told that,

MRo McSWEENEY:

I think that I would object to that

and find that reversible, and certainly in a criminal case,
where purpose is such a vital element, especially if we're
going into penalty cases„
QUESTION:

Well, ar© you asstiming you’re trying it

for the government or for the defendant?
MRo McSWEENEY: For the defendant,
QUESTION: But you're saying that a charge where a
judge says you may infer, and you’re saying fee charge
should be you must infer,
QUESTION:

I didn’t understand you to say that, I

understood you to say that they must find tine purpose,
MR, McSWEENEY; They must find purpose,
QUESTION:

Must find purpose, and

they may infer it

from those circumstances,
MRo McSWEENEY:

May infer it from all the circum­

stances ,
QUESTION: But you insist that the jury must be

39
40
instructed that they must find a purpose to stabilize prices,
MR, McSWEENEY: That's correct,
QUESTION:

And you further insist that there was

no such instruction in that case,
MR, McSWEENEY:

That's ' my position, and I say that

■tills has been the law for fifty years, starting with, in 1925,
Maple Flooring and Cement Manufacturers, which were both,
although civil, purpose cases, and Cement Manufacturers of
course also had in it the element of the customer fraud with
respect to the job protection plan. And those cases stand
for the proposition that you must find in price exchanges
where w© have a circumstantial case on the basis of price
exchanges, you must find that the reason for exchanging
prices was for the purpose of fixing prices, an anti­
competitive purpose.
The government of course relies h@avi.ly here on
Container, and there the Court, finding no controlling
circumstance, analogized the price exchange in those cases
to what it had already found — to the cases, American Linseed
Oil and American Column. & Lumber Company, which were purpose
cases»
I say that the Container case, that the Court had to
have been inferrring purpose in that c&s©, although I recognize
that the Court did not expressly say that in its opinion. But
that is the only way it can be reconciled with the decisions

40
41
both before Containsr and indeed after Container, and after
Container I mentioned reconciliation with the C&S Bank case.
And indeed the Court itself, in the majority opinion in
Container, did reconcile by analogizing to American Linseed
Oil and American Column & Lumber, it said:

The agreement

in the present case, in the Container case, though somewhat
casual, is analogous to those in American Column & Lumber and
American Linseed oil.
But toe trial court in our case permitted a conviction,
without the requisite essential ©lament of purpose.
Now, moreover, with respect to Container, even if
my reading of Container is not accepted by this Court, they
my reading is that they had to infer a purpose„

But if

you read, if this Court should read Container to say all you
need is information exchange plus price stability, that
still wouldn't govern here, because they do recognize toe
controlling circumstance, whether it's a doctrine or other™
wise, they recognize it and use that word, and they said a
controlling ■ circumstance such as was present in Cement would
save a price information exchange, even if it had a stabilizing
effect.
QUESTION:

Nov;, you've emphasized, very properly,

that this is a criminal felony case.

Suppose, to take an,

analogy tot nay be far™fetched, in a charge for the felony of
assault with intent to kill, the jury was instructed -- I'll

41

42

•try -to make it: parallel to 'this instxuchion — that if you
find that ‘the defendant had a gun in his hand, that he knew
it was loaded, that he cocked the gun and pointed it at the
victim and pulled the trigger, you may infer an, intent to
commit the crime charged in the indictment.
Would that be an
MR,, McSWEENEY:

.appropriate charge?
I would think, Mr. Chief Justice,

you may infer it from these circumstances, but you must
infer it to convict him,
QUESTION: Well, you must find it.
MR. McSWEENEY:

You must find it.

QUESTION: You must find it somewhere.
MR. McSWEENEY: Find it, whether you infer it, you
may use -these circumstances for such an inference, but whatever
basis you must find it to convict the man.
QUESTION:

Yes,

In other words, I’ll alter that a

little bit to make it strictly parallel.

"You may consider

tiles© circumstances that I’v© just described as evidence of
an intent to commit the crime charged", and that would be an
app rop riate ins truction?
MR. McSWEENEY;

To consider those circumstances,

they must find a purpose.
Now, I refer this Court fee Citizens & Southern Bank
and I say merely there, in Citizens & Southern Bank, that th©
defendants were trying to avoid violating a State law, the

42
43
anti-branch banking lav/, and like hers in this case, we’re try­
ing to avoid violating a federal law, the Robinson-Patman Act,
and there the Court found that despite an exchange of pricing
information end a stabilizing effect, that there was not a
violation of the Sherman Act»
I would like to mention briefly that what is a
variance from between what we were charged with

we were

charged with a purpose case, and that —- sure, the government
in the indictment talked about effects, but in section 5 they
said what we were charged with, in section 6 they said what
the effects were» But if you go to the bill of particulars,
✓

you'll see that we were charged very definitely when it was
explained there with a purpose — and I refer to page 37 of
Volume I of the Appendix, the Particulars R© Paragraph 12c
It sayd, "This mutually agreed upon illegal course
of conduct of exchanging ,„. was for the purpose of raising
and fixing prices
Finally, and in conclusion, may I rs&y that in the
event the Court should not accept my reading of Container,
and apply Container as the government reads it, that should
b© applied only retroactively, and it also should — we should
at least get the benefit, in a retrial, of the instructions
saying — applying Container only to the conduct of the
parties prior to the decision in Container,
Thank you

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Vary well, Mr. McSweeney.
Mr. DeLone„
MR. DeLONE:

I'm sure that Mr. McSweeney meant

Container could only be applied prospectively? it would
offend the principale against retroactivity.
MR„ CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I took it he meant it

should not be applied to retroactively,
MR.

DeLONE:

And I assume the Court understood

that,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF H„ FRANCIS DeLONE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. DeLONE:

If the Court please:

I want to try to deal with the three additional
reasons which lad Justices Hunter and Adams to believe that
this case should be sent back for a new trial.
Two of those deal with the charges of the Court
/

with reference to conspiracy, the third deals with the subject
of the hung jury or jury coercion.
To deal with the instructions, it is important to
recall, as Justice Powell pointed out earlier, the government
here charged a 13-year nationwide conspiracy involving, all
told, some 12 defendants and some .160 co- cons pi ra tors,

And

this fits with the current proclivity, if w© might call it
that, of the Antitrust Division in any of the nationwide
price-fixing cases that are brought.

If you look at the cases

44
45
brought; within the last ten years, you' 11 see the average
duration of the alleged conspiracy is approximately ten years,
five more than the statute of limitationsc
The government’s brief, as you will have seen,
contains what is really, i.n their factual statement, a hodge­
podge of separate episodes which they refer to as subsidiary
agreements, subsidiary to some over-all price fixing agreement?
and these, with the exception of a couple of pages out of the
44, ar© all agreements which were alleged to have occurred
back prior to the beginning of the statutory period, prior to
December 27, 1948, which is five — I5m sorry, 1968, which
is five years prior to the indictmente
To illustrate, included in their hodgepodge &r© a
-*"■ &r© the transaction concerning applicator discounts in
Oregon and Washington in 1965s
Another "subsidiary agreement” is a transaction
concerning the withdrawal of wooden pallets in Michigan in
1971j and a third concerns alleged predatory pricing back in
1862, in Texas,
You have to realize there is such a hodgepodge in
order to understand the need for the instruction which we
sought and did not g©t in this case from the trial court»
And that was an instructi.on not just, as he did charge, that
the jury would have to determine first whether there was an
over-all conspiracy, and second, whether each individual

45
46
joined that conspiracy,..
Though the Second Circuit recognized in the Borelli
case, from which we modeled our requested instruction, it
was necessary with all these separata and distinct episodes
that were placed before the jury over this 13™yaar period,
it was necessary for something more to be said so that the
jury could not draw from the facts that an individual partici­
pated, for instance, in something to do with applicator
discounts in 1965 in Washington„ They could not draw from that
alone the fact that that individual joined some vast over-all
conspiracyP but, rather, they would b© required to look at
the situation of that individual and what his understanding
was of what he was doing and what he was joining«,
We did not get such an instruction, as was requested,
And the prosecution dismisses this as a semantical nicety -that's the language which they pi.eked up from Judge Weis's
dissent.
But is it really,

if you're going to convict

individuals in a case such &s this,

a semantical nicety to

require that they really know arid understand, what is this
conspiracy that I'm charged with, before they can be convicted
of it,

Because that is really what w© are dealing with,
I submit the prosecution's claim of semantical

nicety is really a cynical disregard of the whole jury system
as we know it.

And then the prosecution, in order to get rid of
the horalli case, says:
or none.

there was either one over-all agreement

And the subsidiary episodes were simply manifestations

of -the conspiracy in action. They could not have taken place
without an umbrella agreement or understanding.

Yet they

never explained, nor was it ever argued, why there had to be
some single over-all umbrella understanding in order for two
or three individuals to do something about applicator
discounts on the West Coast, or about pallete in Detroit,
Or, to bring it down more specifically, to the case
of the defendant Colin Brown,

There was only evidence, as

Judge Hunter points out in his opinion, of his involvement in
some transactions about price and credit in 1965 and 1966,
And Judge Hunter — I say comments, that's really all the
evidence was.

What is there to suggest that Colin Brown, an

individual defendant here, knew from whatever the jury may
have deduced he did back in *65 and '66, that he was joining
some price-fixing or price verification conspiracy that
continued on up into '68, '69, ‘70 and s71?
Indeed, Judge Zirpoli, in the companion civil case,
held that whatever conspiracy may have existed in ”65 and '66,
it was fully terminated and abandoned by 19- — by January 1,
1968, long before the statute hare.
Likewise, as to the defendant Nicely,

The evidence

as to him concerned almost entirely on© sales call in Texas

in 1962„

But; the jury was never told that:»

Did Mr, Nicely

join this over-all conspiracy, the one with which we were
charged?

Never told to focus on what Mr„ Nicely*s understanding

was when he made that phone call, and we contend that we were
entitled clearly to such an instruction on the scope end
purpose and the knowledge of the individual who allegedly
joined the conspiracy»
The other aspect of the instructions concerns with­
drawal, and on that the charge is so brief that it's easiest
understood, X believe, if I read it»

The court said simply;

"In order to find that a defendant abandoned or withdrew from
a conspiracy prior to December 27, 1968, you must find from
the evidence that he or it took some affirmative action to
disavow or defeat, its purpose.

Mere inaction would not be

enough to demonstrat© abandonment»"

And so far w® have no

quarrel with that charge? w© agree with it.
The court went ons

"To withdraw, a defendant either

must have affirmatively notified each member of the conspiracy
he will no longer participate in the undertaking, so they
understand they can no longer expect his participation or
acquiescence, or h© must make disclosures of the illegal scheme
to law enforcement officials."
Now, the government apparently recognizes that isn't
the law, that isn't the lav; as it's been declared by this
Court, A defendant is not a member, an alleged member of a

49
conspiracy is not limited to just two ways; notify all the
other members here, some 160; or go to the cops, if I can use
til at expression.
Not at all,

You can disavow participation in a

conspiracy by conduct.
But the court ruled that out,
QUESTION; Are you suggesting that at that stage it
might be something like a class action, a problem of
identifying who was a member of the class of the conspiracy?
MR, DeLONE;

[Laughter]

On th® bill of particulars

here I think we did have problems of identifying who were the
*r

members, but, in any event, sir, I $hink that it’s perfectly
clear from the decided cases of this Court and the lower
courts that just as you can infer participati.on in a conspiracy,
\

you can infer withdrawal, so long as the conduct which
indicates withdrawal is known to the others allegedly involved
in the conspiracy.
That's what we had here, because we had evidence of
vigorous competition among these companies prior to the
beginning of the statutory period, we had evidence that the
defendant Andrew Watt, instructed U*,S„G„ not to verify at all,
again prior to the beginning of this statutory period, as
part of this competitive scheme,
QUESTION:

Of course, the bill of particulars,

identifying all these people, wasn't available back in *65, '6,

50
* 7 and * 8 , was it;?
MRo DeLONE:

It was not, sir,

[Laughter.3

We did

not have the bill of particulars„
But basically, to limit the method of withdrawal to
two tilings:

one, notify fallow conspirators, whoever they may

b©? or notify the law enforcement authorities is, I think the
government concedes, too narrow a method for abandonment or
s-

withdrawal.»

And there was evidence here which should have been

submitted to tha jury under a proper charge that we were
entitled to — so that we could have been held, the jury
found that we had withdrawn some of 'the defendants
QUESTION:
MRo DeLONE:
QUESTION:

Mr. DaLone ~
—> had withdrawn from the conspiracy»
—■ may I ask, to inquire about the

procedure in the trial court?

MRo DeLONE s

Yes.

QUESTION: As I get it from the briefs, the trial
judge spoke more or less extemporaneously, without a written
set of instructions o
MR, DeLONE:

He had some notes, sir, but h© was

unable to repeat his charge when several times asked by the
jury -to do so, so that he clearly didn't have a full script,
QUESTION: And it went on apparently for several
hours, as well as I can tell»
MR» DeLONE:

Yes„

It was a lengthy charge»

51

QUESTION: And at the end of the period he asked for
objections to what you had all heard?
MR,, DeLONE;
QUESTION:

Yes, he did*
In that period did you call his

attention to th© error in the abandonment instruction?
MRo DeLONE: Well, I didn't personally, but Mr, Keck,
who represents U0S0G0, did, and we had a ground rule in the
case that an objection made by one would -QUESTION: Right, would take car® of everyone,
MR, DeLONE:

That objection appears at page 1757 of

the transcript, Your Honor,
QUESTION: Thank you,
MR0 DeLONE: And w© had requested an instruction
along these lines also, which appears at 1856, I mean one
which did not limit us to theses two methods of withdrawal,
but one which recognized that competitive behavior, of which
others were aware, would itself b© a basis for a finding of
abandonment or withdraw1„

That request appears at 18560

And

I did except to tile refusal to give that for all of the
points that he r©fusedc And he said, "Fine, you don't need to
say any more; you have an excaption to any of the points which
you asked us to giv© and which I didn't,"
So we really covered it both ways.
And I might say the suggestion which th© government,
th© only way they seam to

they just say it's hardly likely

52

that the jury paid any attention to the third sentence, in
view of the generality of the first and second.
QUESTION; And then they make the point that the
counsel were allowed to argue -this to the jury.
MR. DeLONE:

Well, as a matter of fact, if you'd

look at it, counsel never argued it.
that foolish.

We wouldn’t have been

We know the judge is not going to charge it,

we're not going to argue it, because that’s -the best way to
have the jury feel the rug has been pulled out from under
counsel.
That's why, under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
30, you find out first what’s the judge going to rule, so you
know how to argue the case.

And we were told he wouldn't

get to that point, so we couldn’t argue withdrawal and
abandonment to the jury. And you can search the speeches and
there is no argument, because -— so that that’s a hollow
privilege, I night, say, if -there could be one,
I’d like to turn finally to the question of a
coerced verdict.
This has to be viewed not the way the government would
have Your Honors view it, simply taking one sentence in an
exchange between tee foreman and tee trial judge at the end
of their meeting, but it has to be viewed in the context, what
was the total setting of these jury deliberations.
And, if I may, I want to take you through that as

53
quickly as I can, but so you may understand the flavor of it»
The jury started its deliberations on Tuesday, July
8th at about five o'clock in the afternoon, and it deliberated
k

from nine in ‘the morning until ten at night daily, Tuesday,
the balance of Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday*

They

asked the judge some questions, they asked about exhibits,
requests for further instructions.

It was a very active,

lively jury.
And that went on ‘hill Friday when we got word that
there was some-tiling about the juror's health that was —■ the
judge called us into a
of ±h© jury»
present.

meeting, we meet with th© foreman

At that time counsel and the foreman were all

And the judge interrogated the foreman, and we

learned that jurors were fatigued, that -the ladies were
crying, that there were health problems.

Not an awful lot

more than that, but sufficient so the jury begged that they
work shorter hours, and the judge said they’d have some breaks,
shorter 'time over the weekend, and we would work —- they would
only deliberate from nine until six.

Actually, they usually

started a little early than nine, but that was the official
starting time, right straight along.
And

sorry, I sea that my time is up, and I will

have to avert to the brief, because I have to leave Mr. Bartlit
five minutes of time, as I undertook to do.

It is in the

brief, the jury coercion subject is fully dealt with there,

54
and. I would urge Your Honors, because it is a very critical
point to us, I would urge Your Honors to look at the transcript
with care, it starts at page 1837»

Even that portion where

the judge interrogates the jury foreman, in the final
session, after he's been told by notes from the jury that
they could only decide on the basis of compassion for fellowjurors, after he's been told no testimony, no document would
change their views, they vara hopelessly deadlocked? and at
that time the judge tried to see if excusing one juror would
help, because he agreed to take the verdict of eleven»
But he finds that it won't help, so both of them
abandon that effort.

The judge did, as we contend

in our

brief, coerce the verdict.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Bartlit..

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRED II. BARTLIT, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. BARTLIT;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
For an hour we've heard very distinguished antitrust
counsel debate serious complex Issues of antitrust policy
and economic policy.

I think it would be helpful to bring

these down to the brass tacks of the individuals in this
case „
A nan like Andrew Watt, an executive of tills
company, could, under the instructions given by the trial judge,

55

be convicted of a crime where his sole purpose was to comply
with the law, and where it was reasonable for him to believe
that.
Nov/, Mr. Watt went with U.S.G. in the early 1960'3«,
The company was the subject of many Robinson-Patman suits.
He was instructed by the lawyers hired by his employer that
if h© didn't comply with the Robinson-Patman Act he could
lose his job.

He was told that price verification was for

the purpose of complying with the Act.

He was told that it

was lav/ful.
He complied with that, advice.

Container came down in

early 1969. Within a month from -the time Container came down,
Mr. Watt talked to his lawyers again and sent a letter to
everybody in U, S„ Gypsum and said, "Don't verify any more on
any product."

He, himself, had stopped on gypsum some

months earlier,
His conduct in verifying was’upheld by a federal
district judge after a full trial in 1971.

Since that time,

three Courts of Appeals, the Ninth Circuit including Judge
Lombard sitting from the Second Circuit, the Third Circuit,
and the Tenth Circuit have all, in one way or another, approved
the concept of complying with the Robinscn-Patman Act as an
exception, whatever you want to call it, as not a violation of
the Sherman Act,
Mr, Watt, was indicted and convicted for conduct that

56
eight; appellate judges thought; was lawful»
Mro Watt, I represented him at; ‘trial, tendered the
only instruction at that time that had ever been approved by
any reviewing court»
we had.

We had no choice, that was the only law

The Ninth Circuit said, in the Gray case, that it

wss plausible under existing law for an individual to believe
that verification was required to conform with Rob i ns on- P a tm an
obligations»

It was a fact issue for the jury.

Now, if the Ninth Circuit thought that it was
plausible in 1972 to believe that you were complying with the
Robins on-P atman law in verifying, how could Mr. Watt or his
lawyers believe to the contrary?
The trial court said that it would give the substance
of -that instruction, but it did not.
Marks vs. United States,decision of this Court, says,
that, persons have the right to fair warning that their conduct
— fair warning of the kind of conduct that gives rise to
criminal penalty.

Individual have that right. And this Court

said it's a fundamental constitutional right.
If all of those appellate court judges couldn't
perceive that Robinson-Patman verification was unlawful,
how could Andrew Watt have fair warning?
With regardv ■ to ‘the other issues, it seems to me that
the government has made quit© a concession in its reply brief.
In the reply brief, th© government states that the -- at page

57
15, that the judge told the foreman that he preferred a verdict
to a hung jury.
Now, I don’t think — I think that the facte are
much stronger than that concession, because I think you can
look at what the foreman said and what the jury was saying,
and it's easy to conclude that the jury was convinced that a
deadlock was not acceptable.

But the government concedes that

the trial judge told -the foreman that he preferred a verdict
to a hung jury.
QUESTION: Well, there’s nothing -- can't a trial
judge instruct the whole jury that not only he but the lav/
prefers a verdict to a hung jury?
MR. BARTLIT:

That's right, isn’t it?

Yes, sir, he can.

QUESTION: This is considerably less than the Allen
charge, isn’t it?
MR. BARTLIT:

Yes, sir.

I think you have to

consider this against the background of what had gone before.
And if we had known, for example, that the trial judge was
going to tell the foreman that he preferred a hung jury* then
we would have been entitled to an instruction which informed
the jury that the jury also has a right to deadlock if those
are their honest beliefs.
Mr. Watt, Coign Brown, J. Nicely, the individual
defendants in this case, if the Court please, were, entitled to
have the jurors cling to their honestly held beliefs, if they

58
were of -those beliefs, and when the judge indicated his
desire, his preference that the jury not deadlock, we were
entitled to an instruction that the jury was entitled to hold
those beliefs and that a deadlock was constitutionally
acceptable.
QUESTION:

You think there is a problem of a judge

telling that to on© member of the jury, that is the foreman,
with his special status of authority, and depending upon that
to virtually carry the message back accurately and faithfully
to the other eleven?
MR. BARTLIT:

I think there's a problem, Your Honor,

whenever there's a private meeting between the judge end one
member of the jury.

We consented to that meeting, because we

felt w© had no choice.

I think that there’s a reason why there's

a rule against hearsay, I think the reason is that second-hand
statements generally don't com® out the way they were intended,
and I think it's clear here the chances of the foreman, r®~
emphasizing the judge's statement and the judge's belief that a
deadlock was unacceptable are great.
QUESTION;

Pir. Bart lit, before you sit down, you

consented to the private meeting, did you consent to the fact
that there would be a transcript of that and that you would not
have access to the transcript?
MR. BARTLITs

No, sir, We asked for the transcript

immediately, and as the —

excuse m@.

59

QUESTION: Did you know in advance -there would be a
-transcript?
MR. BARTLIT:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

You did.

MR» BARTLIT:

I see.

We feel that the

vie© of the meeting

was not that it was private, because I consented to that.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. BARTLIT:

And I'd consent to it again. The

vice of the meeting was what the judge said about the meeting,
and, in all candor, his description of the masting to us,
which was found by the Court of Appeals not to be accurate,
and prevented us then from asking for the kind of instruction
to which w© were entitled.
That was the vice of the meeting.
QUESTION: Am I correct?

You got access to that

transcript only by requesting it from the Court of Appeals
after you filed your notice of appeal, is that right?
MR. BARTLIT:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, that's right.

Mr. B&rtlit, you mentioned right at the

close of your remarks the names of Mr. Colon Brown and Mr. J.P.
Nicely, on whose behalf a separate brief has been filed here,
and who make quite a separate kind of an argument, including,
among other Idlings, the double jeopardy clause. Their claim
basically is, as I understand it, that thera simply was
insufficient evidence to sustain a verdict of guilty as against

60
them, and 'that, they are constituti on. ally entitled, if they’re
correct, not to be tried again, among other things»
MR. BARTLIT:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Nobody has orally represented them here?

MR. BARTLIT:

No, sir.

That issue is not before

this Court, as I understand it, and we are addressing only
the issues, -- th© sufficiency issue is not before this Court*
as I understand it.
QUESTION: Do you represent. Mr. Brown and Mr. Nicely?
MR. BARTLIT:

I represent only Andrew Watt, Your

Honor»
QUESTION: That was my impression0
MR. BARTLIT:

I undertook, to the extent that th®

instructional errors and -the jury coercion bora on th© rights
of those teo individuals, on this appeal I undertook to -QUESTION:

You have a community of interest?

MR. BARTLIT: That’s right.
QUESTION: But they also seem to be making a separate
argument.

But your understanding is -that’s not within 'th©

grant of certiorari.
MR. BARTLIT: That's my understanding.
The petition is still pending, their petition for
separate appeal on the sufficiency point is still pending,
and has not been acted on by this Court.
QUESTION:

Right. All right,

61
MR* BARTLIT:

Theaak you,.

MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Friedman,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQnf
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR® FRIEDMANS

Mr, Chief Justice, the final words

that th® judge gave to the juror at this meeting he had with
him, at page .1840, is s

"You 'tell them to keep deliberating

and see if they can come to a verdict,"

That’s the last thing

he told him®
QUESTION:
put to your friends

Well now, I put to you the question I
How do we know that that very sensitive

aspect of tiie case was communicated to the other eleven jurors
in th© same way th© judge communicated it, on th© record, to
th© foreman?

MRo FRIEDMAN:

Well, we don’t know specifically,

of course, what the judge
QUESTION: We can assume — I would assume he did
his best, but he’s not a lawyer trained in th© nuances0
MR® FRIEDMAN:

I think there are two things about

this. First, three times before this masting with the foreman,
th© court specifically instructed -the jury that while he'd
lik© them to come to a verdict, and they should re-examine
their beliefs, that they should not give up a belief
consciously held, either because the views of other jurors or
because of their wish to reach a verdict. This, in effect,

62
is a modification of the Allen charge that the Third Circuit
has developed»
So the jury was told repeatedly that they were not
to surrender -their independent judgment.
Secondly, after the foreman returned to the jury,
as far as w© can tall, the jury deliberated for about eight
hours longer before coming to a verdict.
The jury returned to its deliberations at 12:04,
w© assume they deliberated that day until six or six-thirty.
They generally began at eight in the morning. They brought
in the verdict at 10:45 the next day.

So we had a substantial

period of further deliberations.
QUESTION: Well, Mr. Friedman, none of us in this
room know what he told the jury.
MR. FRIEDMAN: That is correct.
QUESTION:

Well, isn’t that a problem?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I don't think so, I don't think so,

Mr. Justice, because before — before it should be held that
a jury has been coerced, it seems to me we need something more
than this dialogue where the foreman had again requested the
judge, saying that the jury is a hung jury, and w6'd like ---•
we think we've had enough of -this. And the judge said, "I want
you to go back" --- he said it at 1839 -- "I want you to go
back and deliberate again."
QUESTION:

In any event, while his practices may be

63
very dubious and fraught: with all sorts of risk, in any event
it was agreed to by counsel for the defense.
MR*, FRIEDMAN:

Oh, yes, Mr, -- it was specifically

agreed to, and the judge told counsel not only that he planned
to do this, but that he would not make the transcript
available, and he told counsel, "If any of you have any
objection to this, I will tell the foreman no, I will not
meet with him."
He then, in turn, called the jury in and wanted to
b© sure that it was the request of the whole jury, not just
that of one.
QUESTION:

Why didn't ha call the whole jury in

and tell then this last statement?
MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, because ■— there were two reasons
Mr. Justice. First of all, nobody knows what the foreman is
going to say, and. it was a request from the jury that ha meet
with the foreman. That was the first thing.
The second thing about this whole procedure is that
if the judge starts telling the jury, starts instructing the
jury that they have a right not to return a verdict, that,
it seems to me, is not the way it's done, because that
encourages the jury in a hard case to say, well, we —
QUESTION:

But it's all right if he tells the

foreman to tell them?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No.

No. All he told the foreman was

64

QUESTION: W©11, that's what I'm saying, that he could
then have called the jury in and said, "The foreman has told
you this, and I want to tell you this is what I have to say»"
MRo FRIEDMAN: Well, he could have —
QUESTION:

Then we at least would have known that

the jury got the correct informationc
MRo FRIEDMAN:

He could have done that, hut I don’t

think it was necessary, Mr* Justice, in light of the previous
charges, in the light of what was said to him by the foreman.
*

The purpose of the discussion, as he indicated, that, the
foreman was trying to convince the court that the jury was
hopelessly deadlocked and that the jury should be discharged.
And he said, "No, I want you to go back and
deliberat© soma more."

He didn't tell them they had to

reach a verdict»
QUESTION: Well, Mr0 Friedman, when -the lawyers
agreed that h© could recieve th® foreman of tin© jury, isn't
it reasonable that they should think that he was merely going
to listen and not give any additional instructions?
That's No» 1»

And you can address both at ones»

And then, No» 2, suppose hypothetically' th© foreman, in the
exhausted state he described himself and that of th© jury,
went back into the jury and instead of relaying it as it was
told him by the judge, went in and said "Th® judge says we’ve
got -to get a verdict»"

What if he said that?

65
MRc FRIEDMAN: Well, tills —
QUESTION; Do you think that would ■— and if we knew
that; wouldn't you think that would taint this verdict?
MR. FRIEDMAN; That might — well, it would be a
problem, Mr, Chief Justice» But. — but I respond to that,
that there is a strong policy against looking behind the jury
and see what influenced their verdict.
QUESTION;

Now --

No, but there ought also to be a strong

policy against, I should think, in 40-same years I've never
heard of a judge visiting with one member of a jury for
anything except communication of a message by the jury to the
j udge o
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. FRIEDMAN; Wall, th© only thing —
QUESTION;

And that's a very hard policy.

MR. FRIEDMAN; That is quite true, Mr. Chief Justice,
but this was consented to not only by the four counsel for
th© corporation, but each individual defendant was specifically
asked if he consented, and they said yes.
The court in this colloquy did not, instruct the
jury, other than to tell th© jury to go back and deliberate
some more.

And that seems to me to be a fairly reasonable

response whan the jury said -- the foreman said, "I think the
jury is hopelessly deadlocked, we'd like to be discharged",
and th© court said, "Go back, deliberate some more and see if

66

you can come to a vsrdiet,,,"

And they deliberated some more.

they deliberated for eight hours.
QUESTION;

Mr, Friedman, when they consented, what,

options did the judge give them?

What were the options open

to them?
MR, FRIEDMAN; The option was that either they would
consent or he would tell the foreman, “No, I will not meet
with you.”

That was what he said.

I think it should be done.

He said, "This is the way

I don't want this transcript made

public, because something may be said that would be
inappropriate, and either, if you don’t consent, I’m not
going to do this unless everyone consents? and if you don’t
consent, I will say no to the jury", and -then I suppose they
would go on in their deliberations end maybe they would send
another note.
That's the way I — they say they were coerced, but
it seems to me it was a free acknowledgement.

Indeed, one

of the counsel, Mr. Keck, not only consented but urged the
judge to meet with the foreman,-—
QUESTION; Rather 'than not talking to him at all?
MR. FRIEDMAN;
QUESTION;

Yes.

Mr, Friedman, I notice the government

doesn’t urge what I had thought it usual to urge in criminal
case, that the instructions should be considered as a whole
and no one singled cut. Does that mean that you want to win

67
only by an essay on antitrust laws to this Court?
MR., FRIEDMAN:

Now, we did — I believe we did

indicate in our brief, Mr, -Justice, that of course the
instructions have to be viewed as a whole, of course they
have to be viewed as a whole., in the light of this lengthy
trial, and the lengthy instructions.
And let me just add, if I may, with respect to one
other point, which was whether the instructions were adequate
to show participation in the conspiracy., Th© judge repeatedly
*— repeatedly charged the jury that in order to convict 'they
had to determine that each defendant individually knowingly
joined in the conspiracy charged in the indictment.
Thank you,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.
