P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 75--53G, Nashville Gas against Satty.
Mr. Wray, I think you may proceed when you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES K.WRAY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WRAY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courts
I am here today rap res eating the petitioner, Nashville
Gas Company, in this case.
This case presents for consideration by idi© Court
the question of whether certain employment policies of the
Nashville Gas Company, which treated pregnancy differently
from -the treatment afforded sickness and accident, constituted
unlawful sex discrimination in violation of Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964.
As such, it is a sequel, I believe., to the case of
General Electric Corap any vs. Gilbert, decided by this Court,
in December of last year.
Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals
ruled against my client on the issues here presented,
essentially on the grounds that since only woman became
pregnant, and they were treated differently from employees
suffaring from sickness and accidant generally, that was scsx
discrimination, unlawful sex discrimination.

4
I submit that that rationale was rejected by this
Court in the General Electric case ~~ both the lower court
decisions preceded this Court's decision in Genera..l EleCtrlc.
Thus , I think we are here today to determine
whether the holding and the underlying rational© of General
Electric extend to the factual situations presented by this
case, which are admittedly somewhat different from the
factual situation of the General Electric case.
There are really two factual circumstances involved
her©0
The

first is that the Nashville Gas Company has a

sick leave policy, wherein it permite employees a certain
number of days of absence with pa/ from covered sickness and
accident.

This plan differs from the General Electric plan

in that seniority is an element of the number of sick leave
days to which the employee is entitled.

That element was not

present in General Electric.
Also the gas company policy has a specific exclusion
for illnesses brought ©bout by th© employee’s willful act.
In this case, Mrs. Satty, the plaintiff, had bean an employee
of the gas company for several years at the time she became
pregnant.

When she was no longer able to work, she was placed

on pregnancy leave, and had she baen absent as a result of
sickness and accident rather than pregnancy she would have
been paid for a portion of the time that she was -absent from

5
work.
The other factual circumstance at issue hare is the
company’s treatment of seniority for job bidding purposes ,
as it affects pregnancy leave.
When Mrs» Satty want on pregnancy leave,, the company
was contemplating converting certain of -the clerical functions
in the department in which she was employed to computers , and,
as a consequence, it was decided that 'the job she had held
would not be filled, that tils job would be abolished»
Thereafter, when Mrs. Satty was able to return to
work after the birth of her child, she was given a temporary
job by the company? that job lasted approximately one month,
and at the end of that time the temporary work was completed.
During that month she bid on three permanent job openings
with the company.

Nov/, in each case, the job was

another employes, another

warded to

female employee, I might add, whose

initial date of hire was more recant than Mrs. Safety’s.
But the company policy was such that, when you had
been absent on pregnancy leave, you were not. permitted to
retain your previously accumulated seniority for job-bidding
purposes.
QUESTION;

At "that point, Mr. Wray, had she been

taken back, then would she regain her prior seniority?
MR. WRAYi,
reflect

Your Honor, the record does not

is reflected in the recordo
QUESTION? Are thsse provisions, Mr, Wray, in any
way the result of collectiva bargaining, or are they all
just employer policy unilaterally devised?
MR, WRAYs

Well, the record does not reflect that,

and I am not sura of the answer,

Mrs, Satty was not an

employee covered by a collectiva bargaining agreement. There
are certain employees of the company who are, and I don5t know
to what extent the policy, as applied to non-union employees,
may be the same as negotiated for the union employees,

I

just do not know the answer to that question,
QUESTION?

You don't know, and the record does not

MR, WRAY?

That’s correct.

show?
The record does not show

that,
QUESTION? Well, wasn’t Mrs, Satty employed for a
brief period after her pregnancy?
MR, WRA.Y? As a temporary employee,
QUESTION?

Yea, but did she have any job-bidding

rights during that period?
MR, WRAY?

Well, Your Honor, I'm not sure whether

in that context hex- seniority would run from the data her
temporary work started or not, but the people who were
awarded the permanent jobs in preference to Mrs, Satty had a
— their employment predated the time of her temporary work.

7
QUESTION %

Well, it*s not; clear to me then what the

job-bidding seniority issue really is.

I think you — I

understood you to say you didn’t know ’whether or n>t, if she
had been re-employed, that sh© would have had seniority.
MR. WRAY %

Well, no, I understood Mr. Justice

Blackmun’s question — perhaps I misunderstood it — was,
had she gotten back a permanent position, would her seniority
have started running at the time she got that new permanent
position back, or would she then be restored to her previous
accumulated seniority.

That's what I said is not clear from

the record.
QUESTION s

Sc the issue here relates to her not

having been taken back at all on a permanent basis?
QUESTION;
vacancies.

position.

Not being able to bid on those two

Successfully.
MR. WRAY;

Well, if shg had bid successfully, yes.

QUESTION;

While she was not employed?

MR. WRAY;

Well, not employed in a permanent

I mean., she was bidding on those positions while

she was in tills temporary status.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wray, do I correctly understand that,

she not only did not receive seniority for the period of her
pregnancy, but she also, because she lost her job there, lost
all her seniority that she had accumulated up to the time cf
her pregnancy?

8

MR» WRAY:
that is correct»

For job-bidding purposes, Your Honor,
She did not lose it for pension and

vacation purposes»
QUESTION: Right.
MR, WRAY:

But for job-bidding purposes, that is

QUESTION:

'Well, she couldn't have a vacation if

correct.

she wasn't working,
MR. WRAYs

Well, whan she went on the pregnancy

leave, had she been entitled to any vacation, having an
accrued vacation at that time, it would have been paid.
And had she come back -- I think she had been employed for
approximately -three and a half years at the time she went on
pregnancy leave -- had she come back and gotten a permanent
job, the vacation to which she would have then been entitled
would have been based on those three and a half years.
QUESTION:

So that tit© only penalty was on job

bidding?
MR, WRAY:
QUESTION:

That's correct. Your Honor,
Mr. Wray, enlighten me, what is the

business justification for the deprival of seniority rights?
MR. WRAY:

Your Honor, I think that the rationale

underlying that policy is this:

1 think it is rational for

an employer to have a seniority policy, I think such a policy
rewards loyalty and continuity of service? that absences are

9
disruptive to an. employer and need not b-a encouraged.

And

within that context 1 think it is rational for th® employer
to provide favorite treatment for -those persons who remain
on the job rather than absenting themselves from work» whether
it is to pursue additional education» to taka another job»
to go home and do nothing for a while; those people who —»
QUESTION: Well, yes» but tee distinction is between
one who is absent because of pregnancy or one who is absent
for other types of illnesses» is it not?
MR» WRAY:

Well» that is the position which the

lower courts took» and that is the argument of tea respondent,
in this case.

Yes» Your Honor»

But —•

QUESTION: Well» &ra I not correct teat had she been
out because of appendicitis» acuta appendicitis» she would
not have lost her seniority rights?
MR» WRAY:

Your Honor» tee only — this policy» in

this respect» is not a written policy. And I don't really
mean to suggest that tee answer to that question is teat she
would have lost it.» but the only examples in the record of
absences which are permitted without loss of seniority ares
I believe they are heart attack» back trouble» and automobile
accident.
QUESTION:

According to the District Court» the

answer to Mr. Justice Blackman's question is yes» she would
have lost

or she would have retained her seniority; she

10

wouldn't: have lost it»
MR. WRAY s
sir.

I think that is a fair infs ranee , yes ,

I mean, appendicitis does not happen to be on© of the

examples covered in the record, and this is not pursuant to a
written statement of policy.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Wray, may I asks

bean abolished , she would have gone on with

If her job had not,
it on return

from her pregnancy leave# would she?
Her old job# if it had not been abolished?
MR. WRAYs
question# Your Honor.

I'm not sura of *bhe answer to that
They might have put the job — they

didn't regard themselves as obligated to hold a, jo.) open.
So even if it were a job that was not being abolished# it
might have been put up for bidding, and presumably someone
else# during her absence or after her return to temporary
status# if it had been put up for bidding someone else might,
well have gotten it.
QUESTIONs

And she, without seniority# couldn't

have bumped that person?
MR. WRAY:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

But I thought you said that this loss

of seniority status is only for purposes of promotion# or
bidding for a job.
MR. WRAY:
QUESTION;

Well, —
But what you've told me now is.: til at her

11
pregnancy, she lost, all seniority for all purposes, including
reinstatement in her former job.
MR. WRAY %

Is that right?

The position of the company is, I believe,

Your Honor, that when an employee gees on pregnane]7 leave,
educational leave, soma form of personal leave, th i company
does not necessarily hold the job open.
QUESTIONS Well, suppose the job was still ©pen *—
I gather, from what you say, that ‘they need not have rehired
her after she — after her pregnancy leave? they could have
filled it with some new employee from outside.
MR. WRAY:

Is that right?

At such — no, Your Honor.

If, at th©

time she was able to return to work, that job was open and
it had been put up for bid, and some other employee —
QUESTION;

Suppose it had not been.

I know you have

said if it had been put for bid, then she would have lost it.
But suppose it was still ©pen?
i

MR. WRAY:

Excuse me, Your Honor, if it was still

©pen, I assume the company has the right simply to put her
back in that position, and without any bidding.
But if it had been put up for bids — I want to make
this point very clear ~~ she would have bean given priority
over a nonemplcyea.
distinction,

I think that's a very important

Now, if soma person

already employed with the

company were bidding on it, presumably that person —
QUESTION;

Well, if no one else had bid on it, it

12

was still open, I gather you're tailing me she'd have got it
back?
MRo WRAYs
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor»
All right»

Now, suppose she had been

in it for another year, and she wanted to bid on some new
job opening, what would her seniority for purposes of bidding,
after she had been back at the job another year, be?
MR» WRAYs
question»

I do not know the answer to that

It would be at least a year, and this goes on
QUESTION;

I know, but what about the three and e.

half years that she already —
MR» WRAY:

Your Honor, the record does not reflect

whether her previously accumulated seniority would have been
restored had she gotten a permanent position or not.
QUESTION;

Do you really think that is so here,

that the record doesn't show, or that

you say the answer

to that question, we just can't assume, we can't —• it might
be one way or it might be the other?

I thought she simply

lost her seniority for job-bidding purposes»
MR» WRAY;

The only reason — I've had the question

asked of mo before, and I did not know the answer.
QUESTION;

Well, it certainly would have bean to

the company's interest to put it in the record, if she didn't
lose her seniority.
MR» WRAY;

Proceeding with the question of the

13
rationale underlying this policy, —
QUESTION:

Well, Mr» Wray, before you get away front

this f you said a minute ago that when she came

the company had the right to give her her

What right did she have?
MR» WRAY:

Your Honor, she had

preference over persons who had not bean employed by the
company»

In other words, if there was a job there and she

wanted it and there was someone who had never been employed
by the company who wanted it, firs« Satty 'would have gotten the
job,
QUESTION:

And she also had a right to • he job if

nobody in -idle world wanted it, too, didn’t she?
MR» WRAY:

Yes, sir»

QUESTION:

Well, what other right did she have?

[Laughter. 3
MR» WRAY:

Sh-a had the previously — she retained

her seniority for.vacation find pension purposes, and she did
have the right, she was given preference for temporary work
whan it was available*
QUESTION:

If it was available,

MR, WRAY:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Is that the end of her rights?

MR, WRAY:
yes, Your Honor.

As it was in this case»

I believe — that’s all that occur* to me,

14
QUESTIONj

Anci yet if somebody was out for illness

— any other illness other than pregnancy — what would the
rights be?
MR. WRAY;

Your Honor, in so far as those other

illnesses were heart attack, back trouble, automobile
accident, the person —
QUESTION?

Well, let’s talcs heart attack.

MR. WRAYs

Okay, we'll take the heart attack#

That person would come back and presumably the company would
endeavor to restore that parson to -the former position if it
was available? if not, to give them a comparable position,
and would let them retain that previously accumulated
seniority for job-bidding purposes#
QUESTION;

And the difference, the reason for the

difference is?
MR. WRAY:

The reason for the difference is, Your

Honor, I think explaining what I feel to be the rationale
underlying a seniority policy, that is, to encourage continued
employee attendance, you can —
QUESTION: Well, there ace two people that couldn't
work $
MR# WRAY:

That’s right,

QUESTION:

a

woman delivering a baby and a man

having a heart attack#
MR# WRAY:

That is correct, Your Honor#

15
QUESTION?
MR. V7RAY;

Both of them equally can't work.
I think the difference, Your Honor,, is

why were they not, on the job working.
QUESTION:

And I submit that —

Because they were unable to.

MR. WRAY; Well

,

but I submit that the person who

has had the heart attack has been subjected to, essentially,
an involuntary, unfortunate accident.

I submit that it's

fair to assume that that employee would rather be on the job
than in the hospital, retaining seniority, with a heart
attack.

And I think that distinguishes it from pregnancy,

which, I submit, is essentially a voluntary condition, it is
subject to the control of the employee, both be for

and after,

•the fact of conception.
And I submit it reflects an employee's sense of
values, priorities, whatever you want to call it, therein
the employee is, in the case of pregnancy, exalting her
personal life choice decision above the interest of the
employer having — and the interested employee being to have
a person stay on the job and not be absent,
QUESTION;

You said automobile accident was another

exception, did you?
MR. WRAY;

I did, sir.

QUESTION;

Suppose the injuries suffered in the

automobile accident, without question, were entirely the
employee's own fault, the grossest kind of negligence?

16

MRo WRAYs

Your Honor, even viewed as a gross

negligence situation, I still don't think it’s something that
the employee would ever say he intended to have happen®
I think that distinguishes it from pregnancy, in my opinion®
QUESTION s

Suppose he got drunk and also smoked

reefers and injected heroin and, as a result, crashed his car?
MR. WRAY:

I still submit that that is significantly

different from a typical pregnancy, in that it is -[Laughter» 3
MR* WRAYs

— something an employee would not choose

or intend to have happen.

And I don't think the same can be

said of pregnancy.
QUESTIONs

But from just the point of view of the

economic self-interest of your client, the employer, what
is the rationale behind ‘this?
MR. WRAY:

Your Honor,

QUESTIONs

Wouldn’t you rather have an experienced

employee bidding on the job?
MRa WRAYs

Your Honor, I don’t —

QUESTION:

Rather than a less-experienced one.

MR. WRAYs

I don’t, think that there is that cost

justification “«*
QUESTION:
MR. WRAYs

I mean, the person bidding the job.
I don’t think that

the opposing

briefs have certainly pointed out, there is no cost justifica-

17
tic>af at least readily identifiable in this case, as there is
in General Electric.,
QUESTION;

But —
I just wondered what the economic self-

interest justi.fication would be.
MR„ WRAY;

Well, I'm not — I can't put it in

doliars-and-cents terms, I think the interest is having these
employees continue on the job without absenting themselves for
reasons of personal preference.
Now, within that framework, the gas company does
provide — a person like Mrs. Satty has experience, which is
valuable to the company, and I would submit that it is in the.
company's interest to have her return to work? and I submit
the company offers certain incentives to get —
QUESTION;

And have har in a vacancy r:thar than

somebody less experienced, wouldn’t it be in the employer's
interest?
MR» WRAY;

No, Your Honor, I don’t thin! so.

I

mean, they offer the incentives, namely, temporary work,
accrued seniority for a vacation and pension, and, most
important, priority over nonemployees.

I mean, I think that

is an incentive whereby the company would try to take benefit
of that prior valuable experience.
But the company is not going to extend that incentive
at the expense of those employees who have stayed cn the job —
QUESTION;

Who did not get pregnant?

IB
MR. WRAY:

Right.

And it is stipulated here, for example, that: this is
the same — the pregnancy treatment is the same treatment that
would be afforded to someone who is taking an educational leave
for example»

They would come back with preference over non»

employees 9 "**"
QUESTIONs
it?

Is that for example, or is that just

An educational leave«
MR. WRAY:

Well, ~

QUESTION:

You limited die physical .disability to

heart attack, automobile accident, and one other.

In the

record, .it's just, educational leave, isn't it?
MR. WRAY:

I believe those are the only *— that is

the only other type of leave where they've had employees go
out for that reason»
QUESTION :

Yes.

QUESTIONS

Mr. Wray, supposing that Mrs. Satty,

instead of having been absent, for pregnancy, had had a heart
attack and had then come back to the company after the same
period of time, how would she have been treated differently
under the company's policy?

I get the impression it's not

quite as precise as I had thought=
MR. WRAYi

Well, when she came back, I think the

company first wuld have endeavored to keep the job open for
her, if it were not — I'm getting away from the situation

19

where -the job was abolished, but —
QUESTIONS Well, assume the job was abolished»
MR» WRAY i

Okay , I think she would have come back

and she would have had, retained her previously accumulated
seniority for job-bidding purposes, and when one of those
three jobs on which she bid cam® up, she would have been
aw arded the j ob 0
QUESTIONs

Well, are you talking in terms of what

the company would have done, or what the company was obliged
to do?
MR. WRAY;

Well, the ~

QUESTION;

We're talking about the rights of the

employes, enforcible rights of an employee here, not what
the company might givs them as a matter of grace,
MR. WRAY %

Well, I think the answer is that it

would b© the company policy to endeavor to do what I have said.
I think t in answer to some interrogatories that are in the
record, the company tried to tales the position, and I think
properly, that they were not obligated to do so, but that
was ’bheir policy, not in any contractual sense but just in a
practical factual sense, that is what would happen.
I'd like also to address in a little more detail
the absence of th© cost justification, which has already been
cited in the opposing•briefs and has been brought up by Mr.
Justice Stewart.

20

I think the difference in 'die treatment of pregnancy
on the one hand and these other a2cidents and illnesses we
have identified on -the other hand? is basically that the
company# I submit# rationally views pregnancy differently
from sickness and accident.

And I submit that this Court

explicitly did die same thing in th® General Electric case,
QUESTIONs

Well# why — you9re going on to explain

why including pregnancy would cost the company money?

QUESTION; Well, there's a limit on the number of -on sick leave, I take it?
MR, WRAYs

Yes, Your Honor, but, the only situation

in which you can envision that it would not cost the company
more to cover pregnancy is if you assumed that every woman who
be cams e pregnant would have used up all of her sick leave

That’s the whole argument; that's the

QUESTION;

And it seems to me that ~ don't you -*

suppose every man in the company exceeded his sick leave every

MR. WRAY:

Your Honor, 1 think that would —• General

Electric would have called that a disparate impact, that, would
be sex discrimin.atd.oxi bailed on effect or impact.

And there

is simply no evidence in this record that the . effect of the
company's policy was to give men mere days absent with pay
than women.
I think it’s directly analogous to the analysis in
Ganeara 1 Eleevx.ic in that respect.
QUESTION;

But to say that it would cost them money,

at least must, assume that: women will be out. on sick leave
more often, pregnancy included, and that they

and that men

22
wouldn't be talcing so much sick leave»
MR0 WRAY;

Well, to ms, there are two points there.

I think if you covered pregnancy where you had not covered it
before, you would be paying more sick leave than previously?
unless you assumed that woman already use up all o:;: their
sick, leave for other reasons»

the women, if the men somehow get more benefits out of this
plan, it would be sex discrimination? but there is no

Mr» Wray, on strictly money, you say that

And she gets vacation pay.

MR, WRAYs

Yes or no?

Your Honor, when she comes back, she is

treated as having three and a half years of service and is
then entitled to whatever vacation ~~
QUESTION;
MR» WRAY?
QUESTION:

Which costs the company money..
That’s right.
Yet., if they give hex* a job, it doesn't

MR, WRAY:

Well, let, me answer it this way ~-

QUESTION;

Am I right?

HR. WRAY:

it does not; cost them — the seniority

for job-bidding purposes
QUESTION:
MR. WRAY:

So whgre is your economic argument?
Your Honor, as applied to seniority for

job-bidding purposes, I do not think it is an economic
argument»

We pay the women who go on pregnancy leave

accumulated vacation time, for example.

Nov;, if we didn't do

that, we could stand up here and say we have a cost justifica­
tion „
The only way wa can correct our policy

change

our policy as it applies to seniority for job-bidding purposes,
is not by absorbing any additional cost to ourselves, we can
only do it by penalising those other employees who choose not
to go on pregnancy leave, or cannot, because of biological
reasons, be pregnant.
And viewed in that way, I think there is even less
reason to infer any pretext in this situation than there
would be if we could sit. up with a dollar-and-cents justifica­
tion.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wray, on your theory, could Nashville

Gas discharge a woman because she became pregnant?
MR. WRAY:
could.

No, Your Honor, I don't believe they

I am not saying that that would necessarily be

unlawful, but the rationale for our seniority policy, which
I have advanced her.

today, would not support a termination.

24
And I think these facts are different, in that she clearly
has priority over nonemployaes coning back, I think that
distinguishes it from a termination situation.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wray, may I ask you this question:

I understood you to answer a question posed by one of my
brethren earlier, to the effect that under General Electric
if the evidence showed that the man as a class got more sick
leave than women had received, that that might be sex discrim­
ination.

Is that so?
MR. WRAY:

Y©s, Your Honor.

MR,. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well,

Mr, Weismueller.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT W. WEISHUELLER# JRaf ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MRo WElSfiUELLERs

Mr, Chief Justice# may it please

the Courts
[sic]
The respondents have today admitted that they do not
believe that they should.fire Mrs, Satty for getting pregnant.
That they believe this would be a violation of Titia VII.
We believe that the record is clear that that is
what the petitioner did# and its effect on Mrs, Satty was

•

mo re devastating than if they, had just corns out and said;
“You* re fired"„
Instead# they constructively terminated her and
made it very hard for her to ever get back to Nashville Gas
Company«
Their policy of placing pregnant employees on
pregnancy leave, rather than sick leave, had the following
effects s
It caused Mrs, Satty immediately and forever -and I believe that the record does reflect that it is forever
that Mrs, S&tty would lose all competitive seniority that
she had previously earned.

In the affidavit of Mr. Henson,

who is tile vice president for personnel# he makes the very
clear statement that an employee who is placed on pregnancy

27
leave and returns to permanent employment retains seniority
she had previously accumulated

for purposes of pans ion and

vacation, but does not, retain such seniority for the purpose of
bidding on jobs.
There is no qualifier in 'there about if she gets
the job back she gets her seniority back, or anything else.
I think that

we can take this plain language to mean that

this is gone forever.

She can ne^er retain -die seniority.

If she is lucky enough to got a jsfo with Nashville Gas Company,
she has to work for three and a h a.If years -QUESTION:

Is this reflected in a collective

bargaining contract?
MR. WEISMUELLER;

Your Honor, the Employee Manual,

where this was the collective bargaining contract? was never
mad© a part of the record, it was never made a part of the
trial.
Now, whether the Employe© Manual and the employee
policies reflected in that —
QUESTION:

Well, most seniority — most collective

bargaining contracts deal with seniority, don’t they?
MR. WEISMUELLER:

Yes, Your Honor, they do, but

Mrs, Satty was not a union member.
QUESTION: Well, was she in the unit represented by
a union?
MR. WEISMUELLERs

No, Your Honor, she was not.

28

Once Mrs. Safety returned to work, after the birth
of her child, she was placed at the bottom of the seniority
le.dder8
I would also like to point out to the Court that
she was placed at, the bottom of the salary ladder»

She was

meJcing $130.80 when she returned, as opposed to $140 „80 when
she left.

The differences can be seen in the pay scale which
x

is found in the record, at, page 99 of ths Appendix.. $140.80
is what she was making when she left, which is commensurate
with her seniority 'that she had at that time? $130.80 is
commensurate with entrance.

That is, she started over again,

it. seems to us, from the: record, not only ir. job-bidding
seniority but also longevity pay raises, which aha might have
had previously, were taken away from her.

Where it states that, "When an employee is absent
because of illness, or non-compensable injury, he will receive
pay depending upon his length of service” et cetera.
Now, tilers are no qualifiers -there. The only
qualifier is in a separate part of the Employee Manual, where
they talk about pregnancy leave.

QUESTIONS

Now# how do voa establish a prima facie

MR, WEISI1UELLER:

First, of all# by showing that:

there was no business necessity in this case# there was no

Because

If the employer can show

QUESTION %

I am particularly interested in how you

distinguish General Electric with respect to the sick leave
issue.
MR. WEISMUELLER:

All right, sir.

In the General Electric case, my understanding of
th© facts are that the only limitation was 26 weeks per illness.
In this case the policy is to give a certain amount, of time,
depending upon th© seniority that you have, for sick leave,
after which you have no further aide pay benefits.
Since there is a finite amount of time that can be
taken for pregnancy leave and only that amount of time, the
employer's liability is limited and without the employer's

showing that more money is ~~ or at least equal money is
given to women under the benefits of this program, then I

more money is paid to women than men, and, as I understand it,
that was one of the major concerns of this Court in the
GiIbert case,
1 believe that if this —

Well, it sounds like, then, that ‘the

That’s correct.

The record does

When we took tills record, w© had no

QUESTION s

Excuse ray in her rupti on.

MR. WEISMUELLERs

Also, when this sick leave policy

is viewed in the over-all context of the treatment of women,
we maintain that this is just the first stage, in an over'-all
program of discriminating against women, and possibly standing
by itself it would be more akin to the GiIbert

situation?

but when taken in context of the seniority issue, we believe
that it, should be upheld.
QUESTION:

Well now, you say possibly.

I thought,

from reading your briefs, that you had conceded that if the

sick leave aspect were hare in a solitary posture, Gilbert.
would control

41
Am 2 mistaken as to that?
MRo WEISMUELLER:
that's in the brief.

No, sir, you're not mistaken that

We've re "“thought the question since we

wrote the brief, I guess is my basic ansv/sr to that.
One thing I would like to point out to Hie Court
before getting away from the seniority issue.

The company

maintains that it also may put someone on sick leave — or,
excuse me, leave of absence, and therefore they would lose
seniority if they over-rein their sick leave.

But this just

Simply is not the case.
QUESTIONS

Do you or don't you concede that if

pregnancy were included, the employer would be paying out
more sick leave money than he is now?
MR. WEISMUELLER:

I guess —*

Well, certainly seven hundred

and —
QUESTIONS Well, forget die comparison with men, but
is it

that it may be or maybe not?
MR. WEISMUELLER:

Certainly $789-something,

because that’s what we're claiming in this case, and if
pregnancy -*» if this Court should find that pregnancy should
be included in the sick pay, then certainly they are going
to be out at least that much money.
QUESTION:

So I take it that your clients at least

hadn't used all their sick leave, and that there's some —
MR. WEISMUELLER:

That's? correct, Your Honor.

She

42
was entitled to sick leave»
However, the case of Mrs0 Dixon I think :..s very
instructive as to the company's policy toward anyone except
pregnant women»

Mrs. Dixon had 18 years® seniority —

QUESTION*

What page are you looking at?

MR. WElSMUELLERs
beginning with response

Excusa me.

Page 24, Your Honor,

to interrogatory 90.

Mrs.

Dixon was absent for ten months, essentially, in one period,
and then another period of five months.
She had built up 18 years' seniority with the
company.

As a result of that, she would have been entitled

to 26 -- no, excuse me, 23 weeks’ side pay.

Yet, upon

returning to work, Mrs. Dixon was granted seniority from
date of hire.

It didn’t, even freeze during the tine she was

gone, even though she had gone well beyond her six leave,
wh i ch w as al Iowa d.
QUESTION*

In other words, your point is the

seniority continued to accrue during those absences?

MR* WEISMUELLER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

It certainly did.

Let's assume that without including

pregnancy, that the*, benefits for nen and woman, the average
benefits for men and woman, sick leave benefits for men and
women in terms of pay are about equal.
that.
MR» WEISMUELLER*

All right

Let’s just assume

43
QUESTION;

And now with the pregnancy included, it's

going to cost the employer substantially more for women.
NoWp you would —~ assuming those facts, would you
still argue that there’s a sex discrimination because

that

sixk leave is not paid to women for pregnancy?
MR, VJE IS MUELLER:

Your Honor, under the holding of

Gilbert, I might argue it, but I don’t believe that I would
b© successful.
Now, this company has naver shown business necessity.
The district court held they didn't even try to make a showing
of business necessity for the seniority stripping policy.
It was only in their reply brief to this Court,
which we received Friday, that they first came — or
articulated at least, this policy of, well, we want to reward
employees who stay around and don’t voluntarily leave to do
other things.
We feel that that simply does not get to the problem,
because an employee's leaving when they're pregnant, as Mr.
Justice Marshall pointed out, is not because they want to go,
it’s because they have got to go, they are unable to work.
And also the company, in light of its sick leave policy of
holding jobs open for very long pariods of time for people
who are out, has shown that they prefer experienced employees.
QUESTION: Well, do they — does the company hold
jobs open and grant sick leave and retain seniority for those.

44
for example, who have what might be called voluntary surgery,
s ay s cosmeti c s urge ary ?
MRo WE IS MUELLERs Although that specific question
cannot be found in the record, their statement about sick
leave is that when an employee is absent because of an illness
or non-compensable injury, now, without qualifiers,, I
assume that 'that would ba covered*

If there were to h© any

qualification, I believe the burdsn of proof would be upon
the company to show that they don’t pay for voluntary surgery
or elective surgery*

I believe that the burden of proof would

Such a change of status is permanent, we believe we
have shown under the facts in this record*
And it is an impediment to firs 0 Safety ever being
rehired by the gas company, and,if shea is rehirad, to her whole
future advancement»

It will tales her three and a half years

to return to the position she was in prior to being pregnant®
In contrast to this, we have employees who are sick
or injured, and out for considerable length of time in excess
of the time that Mrs» Safety was oat, who not only retained
their seniority and their rate of pay but actually accumulated
seniority while they are on their sick leave, and if any
across-the-board raises are made during that time, they get

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES X. WRAY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WRAY;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court s
I submit that the General Electric case controls
here,

general Electric stands for the proposition that a

distinction based . on pregnancy is facially neutral, it is
not., per se, sex discrimination.

It may, nevertheless, be

unlawful if the effect of the policy is to have a disparate
impact on women as a group, as opposed to men as a group.
There is no evidence in the record to that effect,
and Hie plaintiff has the burden of proof on that point.
It may also constitute unlawful sex discrimination

if the policy is not in fact a praghancy policy but a men
versus woman policy, if it is a subterfuge, if it is not what
it appears to be on its face*

There is no 1 evidence in this

record that this policy is anything other than a straight­
forward pregnancy policy, and there is nothing to suggest
that the burden of proof has been shifted from the typical
positi.on of that burden

being on the plaintiff in civil

litigation.
For all ©f these reasons, I submit that the ruling
of the Court of Appeals should b© reversed, and til© case
dismissed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at Is04 o'clock, p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
