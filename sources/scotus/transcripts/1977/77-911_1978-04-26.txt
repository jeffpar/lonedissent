MRa CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in 77-911, National Labor Relations Board against Robbins
Tire and Rubber Company#
Mr, Taylor, I think you may proceed whenever you are
ready#

You have the honor of arguing what we hope is the last

case to be argued in tha course of this year? more important
to us than it is to you#
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARL L, TAYLOR, ESQ#,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, TAYLOR;

Thank you, sir#

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the Court;
The heart of this case is that The Freedom of
Information Act was never intended to be a new and .superior
set of discovery rules, to supersede and override the balance
struck within existing discovery rules, and to provide a
vehicle for enjoining trials and hearings, pending FOIA
litigation#
The Fifth Circuit itself, from whence this case comes,
has emphasised this principle with respect to criminal
litigation#

In a case called United States v0 Murdock, which

is cited in the Robbins case itself in footnote 19, the court
notes that when it was previously faced, earlier last year,
with a FOIA demand in a criminal context, it held, and I quote,
"We find that FOjJA was not intended as a device to delay

4
t

ongoing litigationi, or to enlarge the scope of discovery
beyond that already provided by the Fedeiral rules of criminal
procedure»”
The Fifth Circuit has attempted tc distinguish
Murdock on the ground that the special dangers inherent in
upsetting the discovery balance in a criminal prosecution are
so compelling that Congress could not have possibly intended
such a resulto
But in the case at bar* by contrast* enlarging the
scope of discovery in labor proceedings will have a salutary
effect upon the Board’s procedures,,
QUESTION?

Mr» Taylor* 1 spent three years in the

Executive Branch* and resolutely adhered to just the position
that you’re taking now»

And I thought I was right then in

doing it»
I had a good deal of difficulty after the 1974
amendments* though* where it seems to me that Congress just
kind of plowed ahead and said that that is what they meantc
MR0 TAYLOR;

Mr. Justice Rehnquisfc* the statute

speaks of enforcement proceedings without distinguishing
between particular types of enforcement proceedings»

And I

suggest to the Court that what applies to any enforcement
proceeding applies to all equally»

And I think the legislative

/

history bears me out on that»
If we go back to the 1966 bill* the original

5
Hqt* and look at the legislative history of what was intended
initially by section 7, by exemption 7, and then trace it through
the 1974 amendments —
QUESTION e

Have you compared the House history of

the bill, of the 966 Act, with the Senate history?

They look

like they5re talking about two entirely different bills»
MHo TAYLORs
Senate first»

The bill, of course, came up in the

And what is key in the Senate, as far as wecre

concerned, is the participation of Senator Humphrey, who
specifically protested, during the debates in the Senate, that
the Act might be used to obtain statements of witnesses, prior
to hearing, in Labor Board proceedings? he specifically addressed
the Labor Board»
He expressed the fear, and 1

quote, "that witnesses

would be loathe to give statements if they knew that their
statements were going to be made known to the parties before
the hearings»"
In response to that, Senator Long proposed the
language which became exemption 7, which he said would meet
that problem»
Now, in the House, the relevant consideration is the
focus on the concept of no earlier or greater access»

That's

essentially what Senator Long was trying to get to with the
language he proposed, and the House report does pick that up,
which is what Xsm getting to®

6
The concept is solid in the *66 Act.

The Congress

did not intend to provide discovery to the parties by providing
for earlier or greater access to materials in an ongoing
enforcement proceeding than one could obtain by discovery
with respect to whatever set of discovery rules applied to that
enforcement proceeding.
In sum, I suggest, as the Fifth Circuit held in
Hardemann Garment

decided last year, sthe legislative history

of the original version of exemption 7 clearly indicates that
Congress intended to include investigatory files of the NLRB
within the exemption.”
The question before us, I submit, is whether the
1974 amendments to exemption 7 tvere intended to repudiate the
concept of noninterference with discovery in general, or
with the protection of Board witness statements in particular.
QUESTION

Well, certainly there’s nothing in the

%

Act, either in ’6S or '74, that suggests the Labor Board is
different from OSHA or different from the FTC, or different
from any other agency, is there?
MR® TAYLOR

s

There is nothing to distinguish between

various types of enforcement proceedings? that’s exactly right®
And to that extent, we suggest that there cannot be a
difference between criminal enforcement proceedings, and any
other type of enforcement proceedings®
The Act speaks of enforcement proceedings generically,

7
and that it makes no sense for the Fifth Circuit to say, we
can't believe that Congress would have intended to interfere
with discovery rules in criminal proceedings, but we believe
it when it comes to labor Board proceedings, which are also
enforcement proceedings, especially in light of Senator
Humphrey's particular concern, particularly focused concern.
I 'm not suggesting that h© was singling out the
Labor Board for special treatment.

What 1 think the legislative

history shows is that he was particularly concerned about the
Board, and therefore, interested in getting the Act worded
so that it would protect against discovery in all enforcement
proceedings.

And that is, indeed, what happened.

QUESTION %

Mr. Taylor, what do you do with Senator

Hart's comment, at the bottom of page 30 of your brief, your
footnote, that it’s only relevant te make that determination
in the context of the particular enforcement proceeding.
that support a notion that there's

&

Does

general prohibition

©gainst discovery?
MR© TAYLOR:

Mr. Justice Stevens, if I am right that"

the concept of no earlier ©r greater access still finds its
way into the '74 amendments, then of necessity you must look
to this particular enforcement proceeding, to determine what
discovery rules are applicable, and what access is allowed.
QUESTIONi

You mean by "particular” you meant

particular kinds of enforcement, like Labor Board --

8
MR. TAYLOR;
QUESTXOHs

Yes, sir, exactly.
Is that interpretation consistent with

your notion that the same rules apply to criminal enforcement,.
Labor Board notion?
MR. TAYLORs

The notion, sir, is of no earlier or

greater access, than whatever the discovery rules in the
particular type of proceeding described.

Congress did not

intend that to say that all enforcement proceedings must have
the same set of discovery rules,
QUESTION;

What do you think Congress did intend to

do by the 1974 amendment?
MR. TAYLORi

Congress was focusing particularly on a

set of cases which Congress felt constituted a
distortion of the original intent.

judicial

Congress was not writing

on a clean slate in 1974„
It identified, in particular, four cases from the
District of Columbia Circuit, none of' which had anything to
do with litigation that was then ongoing-.

And indeed, in some

of them, it was pretty farfetched that litigation could ever
be ongoing, and in one of them, the on© dealing with the
papers on the desk of President Kennedy, the court said there
was no possibility there could be any further litigation.
Congress was particularly upset about those decisions»
But Congress mentioned no decision with which it was upset
that dealt with an ongoing enforcement proceeding.

9

QUESTION:

Its primary concern was to undo the decisions

of the Court that had read the exemption broadly as including
anything that had ever been prepared- gener.ically# in connection
with any enforcement proceeding? isn’t that right?
MR* TAYLOR:

That’s rights

And I think it’s also

significant to note that in the catalog of judicial distortions
the Congress identified# it did not include any of the sub­
stantial number of appellate court decisions — not only
district court# but appellate court decisions — which had
protected Board witness statements prior to hearing under the
1966 Act»

There had been quite a number of such decisions#

because the matter had been litigated heavily»

And there

was not a single reference in the legislative history to any
of those decisions as being a judicial distortion.
We suggest that that matches perfectly with Senator
Hart’s comments when he specifically disclaimed any intentions
to radically depart from the intention of the 1966 Act, and
then referred to the original intent as not to allow any earlier
or greatgjr access.
And that the focus of the *74 amendments was exactly
what’s been suggested# was this refusal to provide access
without regard to the enforcement proceeding# or the relationship
of the information to the enforcement proceeding# or the
enforcement proceeding interest# in keeping that information
from being disclosed»

10

QUESTION;

Now that is — even if we were to adopt

that position, that's not a completa answer to Judge Godbold's
decision in this case, is it?

Because he concluded that the

disclosure would not really interfere with the enforcement»
MR» TAYLOR:

I suggest, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that it

is a complete answer? that Congress had determined, as a matter
of law, that there shall be no earlier or greater access? that
Congress has determined that that is an inherent harm, that it
is not going to impose through the FOIA; and that it is not
permissible, consistent with the statute and the

Congressional

determination, then.

It's not subject to caae^by-case
It's just a generic type of rule laid

down by Congress»
MR» TAYLORz

Exactly»

Whatever the discovery rules

in the particular proceeding provida, the FQIA matches that.
But particular courts can't oorce along and say, well, one
court thinks five days is sufficient, another court thinks
tan, another court perhaps —
QUESTIONs
these cases?

Well, then, what good does FOIA do in

I mean, if it simply matches the discovery rules

that already exist.
MR. TAYLORs

FOIA allows — well, as this Court has

said, on a number of occasions, the basic purpose of FOIA is

11
to protect the public interest in access to what agencies are
doing, and not to benefit private litigants*
Now that rule allows the public in general the same
access to information in ongoing litigation as the litigants
have.

In other words, there can be no *=*“ if the information

is to be provided to the litigants, under normal routine
discovery rules, then it must, at the same time, be provided
to the public*
QUESTION:

Well, it just excludes it from the Act.

MR* TAYLORs
QUESTION:

Sir?

....

It excludes you from the Act until

MR. TAYLORs

Yes, sir*

That's exactly what we

suggest that Congress intended*
QUESTION:

Well, I think Congress could have said

that very easily*
MR. TAYLORs
QUESTIONS

Well, I suggest *»“
Just that way®

MR. TAYLORs
QUESTIONS

And they didn't.

I suggest, Mr. Justice Marshall
That’s my problem.

MR. TAYLORs

legislative history is clear, in terms of the 1966 Act "**
QUESTIONs

I don't think Congress says any place that

this doesn't apply to NLRB investigations.
MR. TAYLORs

Congress said that it was not intended

to provide earlier or greater access than would be applicable —»
QUESTION:

Ky question was, that Congress could have

said the FOIA does not apply to NLRB*

And they didn't say

that*
MR® TAYLOR:

They said it doesn't apply to enforcement

proceedings in general, to the extent of providing earlier
or greater access,
QUESTION:

I give up®

QUESTION:

Well, is there anything in the legislative

history that suggests that it was intended to be a substitute
for, or an addition to, the discovery rules provided?
MR® TAYLOR:

No, sir.

Indeed,, all the legislative

history is —
QUESTION:

To the contrary, is it not?

MR® TAYLOR:

-» to the contrary®

The very concept

of no earlier or greater access is to the contrary®
QUESTION s

But.now take your language out of exemption

7, investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes,
and than you have, I believe your '74 amendment, but only
to the extent that the production of such records would
interfere with enforcement proceedings.
Doesn't that suggest some sort of a case“by*-case
or some sort of a balancing approach?
MR® TAYLOR:

We suggest that you've got to look,

again »» that the '74 Act was not written on a clean slate,

and you can't look at those words by looking them up in the
dictionary? that you've got to look at the original Act, and
trace the history of this legislation,,

Look at the evils that

Congress was trying to cure, and look at what Senator Hart
said he was not proposing to do®
And ona of the things ha was not proposing to do was
to interfere with the concept of no earlier or greater access®
So that that sets the framework for what those words mean®
Now, the Fifth Circuit suggests -- and just to get
back to the point that was raised ■»“ the Fifth Circuit suggests
that there is no presumptive damage done to the balance struck

by the Board between discovery and protection by an order that
the statements be disclosed five days in advance®

Because the

statements will become public at the hearing in any event, and
because little intimidation is likely to occur in such a short
■period®
Now we contend that the earlier or greater access
concept is sufficient to answer that question®

But it also

ought to be pointtd out that the harm from any premature
release ©f the identity of expected testimony of witnesses in
an enforcement proceeding is precisely the danger that they
can ba persuaded to alter their testimony, and that it's no
ztnswer to suggest, as the Fifth Circuit did, that the inisimidator
may b® prosecuted after the facts*

Because if testimony is

altered, there's no amount of after-the-fact prosecution

14
that’® going to get that case back? if that testimony is '
altered, that case? may ba lost.
Moreover, a® the Sixth Circuit noted in

Hardemann

Garment, intimidation may be subtle and not susceptible to
proof«
W© submit that these dangers, rejected by the Fifth
Circuit, are indeed precisely the harms that Congress aimed at

felt that the present rules are unworkable, that would not, in
any sense, be frustrating the FQXA,
QUESTIONS
MR, TAYLOR;
QUESTION;

Mr, Taylor —
The point is, again -- yes, sir,
I didn't mean to interrupt you if you

hadn't finished your thought.

But are you relying, whan you

keep referring to Senator Hart, on the passage you quoted
at pages 29 and 30 of your brief?

Is that what you say adopts

the no greater or no earlier access concept?
Because I surely don't read that passage that way,
MR, TAYLOR:

If you start on page 27, Mr, Justice

Stevens, he says, ”My reading of the legislative history
suggests that Congress intended that this 7th exemption was
to prevent harm to the government's case in court by not
allowing an opposing litigant to get earlier or greater
access than he would otherwise have,®
Ke than goes on to say what the evils are.

And

then he says, that, he suggests, is not consistent with the
intent of Congress when it passed this basic Act in 19660
fiThen, as now, we recognise the need for law enforcement agencies
to b© able to keep their records and files confidential0W
QUESTION:

BWhere a. disclosure would interfere with

19
any one of a number of specific interests.w

And then later

on he says, where the production of a record would interfere
with enforcement procedures -*■* this would apply whenever the
government's case in court, a concrete prospective law
enforcement proceeding would be harmed by the release of
information.

And then in a footnote he says, it's

only

relevant to make such a determination in the context of the
particular enforcement proceeding.
Now, you say he’s announcing a general rule that
there’s never to be access.
MR. TAYLORs

Your Honor, he’s saying that the

intention of Congress in 1974 to return to the original
intention, when the Act was passed in 1966,

And when he says,

then as now we recognize the need, he’s saying that the
Congress is recognizing the same need now as it recognized in
1966,
The whole thrust is that there was nothing wrong with
the 1966 Act,
interpreted it.

The problem was with the way the courts had

out some language which the courts could not ignore,

So it’s some

But he says, the approach

is in keeping with the intent of Congress, and by this amendment,
wa wish to reinstall it as a basis for access to information.

20

MR. TAYLOR:

Exactly? sir.

And that's why I suggested

that it was significant that Congress did not point to any case
which denied access? denied earlier or greater access? in an
ongoing enforcement proceeding.
Congress focused on four cases specifically.
focused on an Identified evil.

It

And when you match that up

with Senator Hart saying, we don’t intend any radical departure
from existing case law, and none of the cases they referred to -and they were well aware of the cases,

You know, that's what

they had locked through the cases

QUESTIONS
I may.

Mr. Taylor, let me test you once more, if

"this amendment explicitly places the burden of justifying
nondisclosure on the government, which would have; to show that
disclosure would interefe.

with enforcement

proceedings,

deprive a person of a right to a fair trial, constitute an
unwarranted invasion of personal property, reveal the identity
of informants, or disclose investigative techniques or
procedures."
But under your view, all he would have to show is
that we have rules that don't allow disclosure.

He wouldn’t

have to 3how any of those things, if I understand you
correctly®
MR. TAYLOR:

Mr. Justice Stovans, I think what he's

really two parts to exemption 7.

up with the original Congressional intent, and you have to
look at what he intended there,
QUESTIONS

That is, they don't have to make that

showing?
MR. TAYLORs

Yes, sir.

But then he goes on to say,

is where the specific showing comes in, perhaps — that th©

proceedings by impeding any necessary investigation.
That's got to mean something

Because ho says, it would also apply.

And

that if there is a case-by-case determination to

that that's what he intended it to apply to.

22
But in any avent, we don't have that case h^re,
Now —■
QUESTIONt

Well, you do have the case here, though,

where your whole exemption claim is based upon the proposition
that disclosure of the information would interfere with
enforcement proceedings; don't you?
MR» TAYLOR:

Yes, sir®

But Congress has already

defined —
QUESTION:

And you say that your rules, your discovery

rules, were promulgated upon the proposition that they are
necessary to prevent interference with enforcement proceedings?
MR® TAYIORs
QUESTION:

Yes, sir®
And that’s enoughc

Just show what your

rules are, and what the basis and justification for the rules
are»
MR® TAYLOR:

Yes, sir»

We also rely on the proposition

that it hardly needs argument that intimidation is a danger
from the premature release of information in an enforcement
proceeding®
QUESTION:

And that these rules are based upon that

general possibility of the disruption of the enforcement
proceedings, and that those are the rules, so based and so
justified, and that they — the FOIA does not provide for an
individualized determination whether in any particular enforcement proceeding, there would be a disruption©

23

MR, TAYLORs

Yes, sir.

I'd like to turn just very briefly to exemption 5,
In the alternative, we ask the Court to rule that investigatory
witness statements are protected by exemption 5 of the FOIA,
as work producte, except for the use, of course, of Jencks
statements.
This Court has already held in Sears that exemption
5 includes the work product privilege, as well as the executive
privilege,

VJhile the executive privilege protects only

deliberative material, and that is, of course, what this
Court rules in the Mink case, the work product privilege
protects trial preparation material, which these statements
clearly are, under Hickman v, Taylor.
In Sears, the Court referred to the work product
rule of Hickman as applicable to government attorneys in
litigation, and therefore within the scope of exemption 5.
We suggest that since the statements in question are
protected by Hickman, it follows that they are protected by
exemption 5.
Now, I might just finally point out that this Court
itselfr going back — well, really going to both points for a
minute — this Court itself has emphasized that the purpose
of the FOXA is not to serve the needs of a particular litigant?
and therefore necessarily not to provide discovery, but to
satisfy the public interest.

24
And the public interest of what the Board’s
investigation shows, in this proceeding, is going to corns out
in the trial»

The record will ba fully disclosed.

As thi —'

:vwui>

t said in Sears, when it denied access

to the general counsel’s goal memorandum, making a decision
t© prosecute, this Court said, the public interest is not
strong in seeing these, because they'll come out at the trial
in any event.
QUESTION?

Well -- but can’t an agency respond to

an FOIA claimant’s request that the public interest, in your
request, will be served when two years from now we announce
our conclusions on this subject, so wait until then?
MR, TAYLOR:

Mr. Justice Rehnquisfc, I respectfully

suggest that that's not the situation \?e have here? that five
days from the date that this order was issued this case would
have gone to trial, but for the order.

And that the public

interest in whatever the general counsel had investigated
would have come forward at that time.
QUESTION:

What if the request had been sis months

before the case would have gone to trial?
MR. TAYLOR:

Well, then, it would have been six

months, unless the discovery rules provided for access earlier.
QUESTION:

So really it doesn’t make any difference

whether it’s two years, or six months, or five days?
MR. TAYLOR?

No, sir, it doesn’t.

But I would also

25
point out that discovery in many criminal proceedings lasts
for quite awhile.

And that maybe 6 months or two years as well®

I’d like to make one final point, and that is a
practical point.

The First Circuit, in Goodfriend v, weat«rn

said, quote, we do not believe that Congress intended to
transfer, from the Board to the courts, the case-by-case
adjudication of discovery disputes in unfair labor practice
proceedings, close quote.
Such case-by-case adjudication is precisely what
the Fifth Circuit would require, with the requirement that
the Board show specific harm in every case.
The recent experience of Federal courts with civil
discovery suggests that those delays would be crippling.
they'll occur in every case.
every Board case.

And

There will be a FOIA case within

And we suggest, in light of this Court's

admonition, in Air Force v. Rose, that the FOIA is intended to
be a practical, workable, statute? that the exemptions are
intended to be practical and workable? that the First Circuit
is right, that that is inherently impractical and unworkable,
and would impose crippling delays on all enforcement procedures:,
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?
Mr, Earnest

Very well, Mr. Taylor.

26
ORAL ARGUMENT GF WILLIAM M. EARNEST, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF . OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. EARNESTs

Mi’. Chief Justice, and may it pleas®

the Courts
The primary issue here before the Court is whether
a government agency is going to be allowed to deny a valid
request, under the Freedom of Information Act, as amended,
by giving a categorical, par se, response of denial, that
any meeting whatsoever of a statutory burden of proof, under
Section 552(a)(4)(B) of the amended Act, the burden ©f proof
is squarely on the government in this case, in a de nov©
:

/

proceeding.
The '74 amendments also provided for in camera
inspection.

There were some substantial revisions in the

*74 amendments.
Now, at the district court hearing in this case,
the Board presented no evidence whatsoever to support its
claimed exemptions.

This was even after the court reminded

the Board that it had the burden of proof.

I think in the

Appendix, on page 71, the Board admits that it presents
no evidence in this caso at all#
On page 91 of the Appendix, th© court, after having
reminded the Board that it had the burden of proof in this
case,

inquired

as to the nature of these statements, whether

the statements were unique in any way? whether there's anything

27
unusual in these particular statements that would cause an
interference, or whether it was the Board's position, per se
position here, that the giving of virtually any statement,
regardless of who gave that statement, or what might be included
in that statement, would be interference.
And the Board accepted the latter position, a per
se approach.

This is, of course, an approach that, in toto,

would exclude documents.

In runs contrary to the segregable

amendment, the segregable portion added in the '74

amendments.

The Board hare is claiming a blanket immunity from any turning
over of this information.
This was despite Senator Kennedy’s remark, during the
consideration by the Senate, that there t/ere no blanket
exceptions.
There is nothing in the statute
investigatory statements.

Now,

specifically exempting

I think in one of the amicus

briefs, the Freedom of Information Clearinghouse, page 13 of
that brief, exemption 3 is discussed there.

Exemption 3, as

I understand it, exempts from disclosure a document that would
have a statutory exemption.
in this case.

There is no statutory exemption

Although Congress is well aware that the Board

and other government agencies all have investigatory statements.
Quite to the contrary, Congress in the s74 amendments
did away with this stonewall, categorical approach that had
been taken.

These four casas, D.C. Circuit cases, were

28

illustrative of that particular approach,, a blanket, rubber
stamp-type approach.
And that was what they sought to turn around.

It

was a mechanical and wooden, as that phrase has been bandied
about, test.

And Congress was foscusing hare, on the *74

amendments, with regard to exemption 7 in particular, on the
effect of the disclosure with regard to the enforcement
proceeding.

Would there be interference?

QUESTION*

As I understand it, Mr. Earnest, this

proceeding has simply been stayed pending the outcome of this
ruling under FOXA?
MR. EARNEST*
QUESTION*

It has not been stayed by any court.

But I mean, the NLRB has declined to

proceed with it,
MR. EARNEST *
QUESTIONs

At their own volition, yes.

Right.

So there's no question of mootness

hare?
MR. EARNEST*

Yes, in fact the District Judge —

Judge Hancock of the District Court specifically gave that
option to the Board’s counsel.

He said, I can order you to

turn them over right now, or I can order you to turn them over
X number of days before the hearing.
And he says, 1 don’t think you want — he says, I
have the authority to do either, and I'll basically give you a
choice

23
And so — but there was no stay as such.

And in fact,

we would be through with this thing,, had the Board complied with
FOIA.
QUESTIONS

But FOIA hasn't got anything to do with

whether there's a hearing or not does it?
MR. EARNEST;

FOIA has — that's correct.

That's

correct.
QUESTION;

So even if it were dismissed, it would

still be a live FOIA casa»
MR. EARNEST:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

That's correct.

I mean, even if the Board case was

dismissed,
MR. EARNEST;

Yes.

There was an interesting comment

made just -*-■ and I think it may have been in regard to the
exemption 5, that the Board's duty of disclosure or the public
interest would have been met as the facts were brought out
in the hearing.
Well*, that's not quite the case3

Because the dccu»

menfcs sought in this case will never be brought out to the
public in the hearing.

They are produced to the person

in litigation with the agency only upon request, and they are
retrieved by the

Board after that.

There's no opportunity

to make a coPY
QUESTION;
FOIA?

Well, couldn't you go after review under

I think you can go after it any time

MR. EARNESTS

Even —

Well, they have taken

— say it’s after,

MRo EARNEST*

I think they have taken ■— Mr. Justice

Marshall —- they have taken the position that even a closed

or could —

But they would have to show that specially

for this particular —
MR0 EARNEST*

They couldn’t just take the blanket one

you call wooden, they couldn’t take the wooden approach then,
could they?
MRo EARNEST*

I think they would,

Would they be successful?

MRo EARNESTs

I don’t think they’ll be successful

31
in this,
QUESTION:

I9m sura of that,

QUESTION:

Mr. Earnest, you didn't make your request

under the Freedom of Information Act for the purpose of
public dissemination?
MR, EARNEST:
QUESTION:

No, I did not.

And I made it

If you win, the public wouldn't necessarily

benefit, except derivatively, if this is the public purpose
of the Act,
You mad2 your request for use to litigate this
Labor Board proceeding, didn't you?
MR, EARNEST:

I had a personal us© of that.

Another

member of — and we are a member of the public,
QUESTION:

Yes,

MR, EARNEST:

But another member of the public may

have a different purpose®
QUESTION:

And I don't know that —

But your purpose was to get this information

for your use as a lawyer representing the employer in that
Labor Board proceeding?
MR, EARNEST:
QUESTION:

That’s correct, sir,

And under the Board's rules, after

& witness testified, as I understand it, you're entitled

to any statements he’s made,
MR, EARNEST:
QUESTION:

Upon proper request,

Upon propoer request, and you're entitled

32
to them as a lawyer, and in that proceeding.
MR. EARNEST:
QUESTION:

But not to keep.

Just -»

And not to disseminate to the public,

either.
MR. EARNEST:

That’s correct; that’s correct.

What Congress had in mind — I think this has been
clear from the decisions — was that there be maximum possible
disclosure together with a very narrow construction of the exemptions*
Of course, the Board’s position is that nothing has been
changed by the '74 amendments*
The statute, I think, is clear that there must be
proof of such a fact.

If, in fact, there is such a fact,

then there is such proof.
In each agency — there was some discussion here
earlier about how the Act would apply to different agencies.
Well, I think the Act can apply to different agencies, and
there can be consideration of withholding of documents by
those various agencies to the extent that there is any
interference with that particular agency’s particular needs.
NLRB has particular concerns, one of which is voiced is"'
the oraployer^employee relationships.
particular concerns.

TKe SEC also has

Every other agency, OSHA, and to the

extent that those concerns are valid concerns, they are
capable of proof.
QUESTION:

But every one of them, as your opponent

33

suggesta, is going to end up in the Federal district court
before you have the agency proceeding under a FGXA proceeding,
MR, EARNEST:
Justice Rehnguist.

I very much disagree with that,

He has said — I don't think he quite went

so far as to say that it would end up in district court, but
he said every ease would be — every Board case would be a
FOIA case.
Quite frankly, a FOIA case should not even get to the
district court.

The agency ought to do — the request first

goes to the agency, and is appealed within the agency.

So

the district court should never have to fool with it,
QUESTION:

If the agency complies with the request.

MR. EARNESTs

",

QUESTION:

If th® agency complies.
'

. •

But I gather from your opponent's position

that the NLRB is not about to comply without being told to
comply by the court.
MR. EARNEST:

Well, a case in point might be the

device and appeals memorandum that was considered by this
Court in Sears.
QUESTION:

Well, if on© aid© knuckles under, the.es is

never a judicial controversy, is there?
MR. EARNESTs

That is correct.

But if doing what

you are supposed to do is knuckling under, I don't consider
that t© fee the cane„
QUESTION:

Well, do you concede that in a given,

particular cas©,^ there could be justification for tha agency

to assert a claim under exemption number 7?
MR. EARNEST:
QUESTION:

Yes, I do.

And

bo

that certainly would leave room

for judicial controversy in any particular case, wouldn’t it?
MR0 EARNEST:

It would.

There is no assurance —» and

I think Congress realized this at the time when it enacted the
law.

But I think it was Congress' intent to have the District

Court consider that when there was a true controversy.
QUESTION:

The NLRB says there should be a per se

exemption under exemption No. 7 of the statements.

You're

not, on the other side, arguing that there should be a per se
disclosure, are you?
MR. EARNEST:
QUESTION:

No, I'm not.

Does anything in the legislative history

show that Congress intended that this should be used in lieu
of discovery?
MR. EARNEST:
QUESTION:

No.

And that's what you want to do?

MR. EARNEST:

It smells of discovery, okay?

But I

think the two actions era separata, and I think that the rules
are equally applicable to all agencies
QUESTION:

*

But a ■— the two actions are separate»

You can get these after the hearing, and that you don't want
them afterwards,
MR. EARNEST:

I could get them after.

35

QUESTIOK:

Well, you don't want them afterwards, do

you?
MR, EARNESTx
QUESTION:

Probably not,

Well, the records show you didn't*

You're litigating -MR, EARNEST*
QUESTION*

to have them before.

Then why before instead of after?

MR* EARNEST*

To resolve credibility issues in this

case, which is ~
QUESTION*

So that's discovery?

MR, EARNEST*
QUESTION*

Well

--

Curiosity?

MR. EARNEST:
QUESTION*

*

Well, what other respect is there?

MRa EARNEST*
QUESTION*

In that respect, yes*

No, it's not a case of curiosity,

Well, do you think that's what Congress

was interested in, protecting your curiosity?
MR0 EARNEST:

Well, I think Congress was intending

.in having agencies operate with openness, and to the extent
that their processas would be interfered with, that they
were entitled to withhold that informations

And I think that if

there is such inference, then the best person in the world
to show that is tha agency0
of that*

And I think there must be proof

I think the statutory language is clear»
With regard to your question about, would I want

36

these statements after the hearing, I cannot recall specific
Senators or Congressmen involved, but there is very adequate
legislative history backing for —* that information is really
only worthwhile if it's received timely*

And for my purpose,

for my particular purpose, it may be only valuable to me if
it's timely.
QUESTION*

Well, that's when it's fulfilling the

function of discovery before trial, discovery before hearing.
You concede that this is — you treat this as part of the
discovery function in regulatory litigation?
MR. EARNEST*

Well, I would wind up with the same

document, whether you get it under a discovery, or whether
you go under FOXA.
But all I’m saying is, that, it makes no difference
whether there’s a discovery proceeding there or not.

And

I -»«■ it’s clearly contrary t© the Board or any government
agency that takes the position that its discovery procedures
govern them? that's disolosable under FOIA.
Because if that bo the case, then all an agency * .need
do to get around FOIA is just adopt a policy of nondisclosure.
And you have — and FOIA is of no effect.
QUESTION*

How about something that's clearly not

disclosable under the Federal rules of criminal procedure?
Do you think that a criminal defendant could go into the
district court, where a criminal case is pending, or another

37
district court* and aak for it under FOIA?
MR. EARNESTs

I think, under FOIA, again it would

:

get back to a showing of interference»
QUESTION s

You think in every single criminal case

that a separate case could be brought, deciding whether or not
discovery over and above that provided in the Federal rules
of criminal procedure, would interfere with the prosecution®s
case?
MR. EARNESTs

Xem not sure I understand your question,

Justice Rahnquistfc
QUESTIONS

Well, do you think that in every single

criminal prosecution the defense lawyer could start separata
litigation under FOIA, saying I know Ism not entitled to this
information by way of discovery under the Federal rules of
criminal procedure, but I think I am entitled to it under FOIA.
And then a separate case would then go on as -- perhaps within
the criminal department of the Justice Department, perhaps
in a district court — as to whether or not the prosecution’s
case would be prejudiced by disclosure of that information?
MR. EARNEST*

I’m not really a criminal lawyer,

so I*m not really speaking from a good basis on fehatc
do «« I do feel that FOIA is a separate

But I

» a separate statute,

apart from other statutes, and it exists —» the availability
of information under FOIA — I think there are built in limitations
within FOIA without having to rely on the other statutes, and
that as a matter of proof, any interference or something per 3©

38

that ia exempted.

And I believe in exemption 1, under I guess

it's the confidentiality, that there is a special provision
in there concerning the FBI.
QUESTION:

But the burden of proof is on the agency.

MR. EARNEST:
QUESTION:

That's correct? that's correct.

Mr. Earnest, following up on Justice

Relinquish* s thought, it occured to me, the statute doesn't use
the word "prejudice"; it uses the word BinterfereAnd why
isn't any modifications of the rules that would otherwise
obtain in the enforcement proceedings an interference within
the meaning of the statute.
Isn't it — if it's a change in the proceeding,
which it would be if you're getting discovery that you couldn't
get under normal rules, why isn't that, per se, an interference?
MR. EAINESTj

Well,

aren't

you getting into this

test that the Fifth Circuit spoke of?

comparative discovery

And I don't think that the FQIA Act intended to amend an
agency's discovery rules,
QUE8TICN:

Well, I suppose *-«• you answered Mr.

Justice Marshall by suggesting that the legislature simply
didn't consider or talk about discovery.

And yet you're

seeking to use the statute for discovery, and doesn't the
word "interfere," in effect, say any change in the procedure
there is within the exemption?
MR, EARNEST?

I don’t see interference as that, no.

39
You're reading interference as though it

QUESTION %

meant prejudice, I think.
That they ■»«
MR. EARNEST:

I read interference as keeping the

government agency from performing its statutory function.
QUESTIONt

Well, the statutory function, as implemented

by its own rules governing the enforcement proceeding, would
normally be

no discovery other than that contemplated by

those rules.
MR. EARNEST:

Well, I may not agree, and do not agree,

that the Board's discovery rules arc necessary for the carrying
out of its statutory function. In fact, I believe that a looser
rule, from the Board's point of view,

would

aid them in

carrying out that function,
QUESTION:

Well, in any event, you're saying that
‘V

FOIA intended to authorise a change in the nature of the Board's
proceedings?
MR. EARNESTs
QUESTION*

Right.

And then you're saying that the change

is not an interference unless it would harm the enforcement
effort?
MR. EARNEST:
QUESTIONs

That’s correct.

That isn't necessary — necessary reading

of interference? it may be a correct on©, but it's not a

40
necessary reading of that word.
“prejudice,”

It would bo if it said,

But the word, "interfere,n l*d just suggest, is a

different word.

Or it doesn't say harm or prejudice, it says

MR® EARNESTj

Well, the agency talks — the legislative

history talks in term* of interference, but also the word, runsu
I don’t recall the word prejudice being
QUESTION;;

being bandied about,

Well, your basic claim is that the FOXA

imposed certain duties upon th© agencies, without regard or
respect to their preexisting rules.
MR, EARNESTs
QUESTION?

That’s precisely correct,

Maybe it would change them? maybe it

wouldn't,
MR, EARNEST?
QUESTION?

That’s correct,

But it imposed statutory duties on th©

agency,
MR, EARNESTt
QUESTIONS

That's correct,

And that their preexisting rules of

discovery are basically irrelevant to tnose auties?
MR, EARNESTs
QUESTION:

That's correct,

Including the United States as a civil

litigant, or th© United Statas as a criminal prosecutor?
MR, EARNEST?
QUESTION:

So io your answer yas or no to ay question?

MR, EARNEST?
QUESTION?

I think FGIA is independent,

Yes, including them as either,

So by going into the district court, after

41
an agency declined to respond as requested, you acknowledge
that you could hold up the unfolding of the case for a year?
13 months, two years, even more, by going to the district court.
Court of Appeals, and petitioning for cert up here?
That's a possibility, isn’t it?
MR» EARNEST:

It is a possibility, yes, sir.

But

it’s also a possibility, too, that I would do ray client a great
service by bringing

out facts of credibility, and this is the

QUESTION:

Which you suggest you can’t bring out by

the ordinary discovery proceedings?
MR, EARNEST:

Well, ordinary discovery proceedings

under the Board, no.
QUESTION:

Well, you would get the statements; after

the witness testified?
MR. EARNEST:

If I requested them, yes.

But I would

have approximately five to ten minutes — and I’ve worked for
the

Board, so I’r aware of this “-that 1 would have approximately

five to ten minutes to

statements could, be listed the names of
credibility in this situation

*“■*• and you’d have

of corroborating witnesses,

some of whom may or may not be employees,

I would have; no

opportunity to have checked that out.
QUESTION:

No one has mentioned -- perhaps it. isn’t

relevant ■»« the potential for retaliation against an employee
by an employer.

42
MR. EARNEST:

Weil, may X address a myself to that,

Mr. Chief Justice?
QUESTION:

Xa that a possibility?

MR. EARNEST:

I think it is a possibility, yes, sir.

The — as X’ra sure the court is wall aware from the Scrivener
decision, that 884 protects such a witness.

In fact, it gives

him greater protection than he would have if he had not — if
this disclosure had not been made.

The company would in. p_.t

on notice, knowledge of who such people were, and what was
contained in those statements.
And if something were done, as in this case, which
was a five-day period, something were done to that witness,
some sort of intimidation, that certainly would be brought
out at a trial *•<*
QUESTION?

They would not be likely to do their

intimidating in the five-day period.
MR. EARNESTs
QUESTION?

They might wait a year.

Well —

Then what are you going to do about it?

MR. EARNEST:

I don't think you’d ever have any

assurance that someone will not obey the lav?.

But in flic

case, there’s no evidence that there has been any disobeying
°x the law or thas clientr that the disclosure at the hearing,
or

r"° fck®' tearing, would have no effect.
If the employer or union involved are going to

discriminate against the employee or intimidate for that,

43
whether it’s after the hearing or before, it would make no
difference there.
QUESTION:

Mr. Earnest, under the Board's rules, do

you have a right to obtain

Is that customary in an agency procedure?

In the civil rules — under tha rules of civil procedure, you

The second one.

Usually there are three

parties in a proceedings:- the government agency, which may have

it wasn't just intimidation*

There was

MR. EARNEST;
with me on that,
preferred method.

Well, I don't know that they disagree

I think that’s their effort -- that’s fchsir
And I think it's the best method.

X think

openness is the best method.
QUESTION;

But they haven’t been open here?

MR. EARNEST;
QUESTION;

No, they haven’t been.

That’s what I meant when I said they disagreed

with you in this case.
MR. EARNEST:

One thing I would particularly like to note

is the Fourth Circuit's deedcion in the Charlotte Mecklenburg
Hospital case, the Fourth Circuit war the circuit that
.'submitted the Wellman Industries ease, which is one of those
that was pre-amendment.

And the Fourth Circuit having looked

at the 574 amendments I think has changed its mind about its

/

48
earlier decision and that is of the opinion that it should
follow on a case by case basis.
With .regard to exemption 5 rained by the Board, 1
do not think that one*s str. tcreiitc art mroronia or letter*.
I think such a cocmiant is the type of a docmeat that would
be a statement of an agency employee, his own. statement ©s
opposed to someone out3i.de the agency.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Thank you,, gentleman.

Your time has expired.

The case is submitted.

(Whereupon, at 10:00 o'clock a.ra„, the case in the
