££££1L:£I1:L?I£§MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Mo. 76-6372, Leon Webster Quilloin versus Arde.il
Williams Walcott.
Mr. Skinner, I think you may proceed whenever you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM L. SKINNER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. SKINNER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case involves the statutory scheme of the
adoption laws of the State of Georgia.

The statutory scheme

of the adoption laws of the State of Georgia that presently
exist — and, of course, it should be noted that this is
going to change effective January 1, 1978, provides that an
adoption may be had of a minor child with only the consent
of the mother where the child is illegitimate'.
This is contrary to the first paragraph of the
statute concerning consent which says that an adoption can
only be had with the consent of all living parents.
QUESTION:

You are referring now to the new

statute.
MR. SKINNER;

I am referring to the old statute

which has —
QUESTIONs

So that

V7G

have it clearly before us,

4
tell us what the old statute is again and what the new sta­
tute is.
MR. SKINNER;

All right.

The old statute does

start off with a provision that no adoption car, be had of
minor children without the consent of living parents.

It

goes on then to state exceptions.
One of the exceptions is the challenged statute
here which is that the consent of the mother alone will
suffice if the child is illegitimate.
This, of course, has been interpreted by the
Georgia Supreme Court in Smith versus Smith to mean that the
father must petition to legitimate the child prior to the
filing of any adoption action or he loses the right, to legi­
timate the child.
That was applied in this case.

It was clearly

applied because in this case Mr. Quilloin had not tiled a
petition to legitimate the child prior to the filing of the
adoption.
QUESTION;

But he did file one afterwards, did he

not?
MR. SKINNER:

Yes, sir, he filed it as what I

would consider defensive measures to the adoption proceedings.
QUESTION:

And did not the Pulton County Superior

Court judge find that it was not in the best interests of
the minor child to grant the legitimation after the long

5
lapse of time?
HR. SKINNER:

I do not think that that was the

specific holding of the Trial Court*
QUESTION:

Is that not one of his findings in the.

Appendix?
MR. SKINNER:

That is, but I think that that was

based upon the conclusions of law that Mr. Quilloin had no
standing, based upon the challenge statutes which only give
standing to object to adoption to the legal father: that is,
the father who has married the mother or who has legitimated
the child prior to the filing of the adoption action.
I would like to point out in that regard that in
this case, the Appellees married each other in IS67.
Darrell did not come to live with the Appellees
until 196:3.

The adoption action was not filed until 1976.
I see no real distinction in saying that the

legitimation action is late when the adoption action is not.
The adoption action, in my opinion, was filed purely and
simply to eliminate Mr. Quilloin*s rights under the adoption
statute of the State of Georgia because I believe that the
record is quits clear that apparently Mrs. Walcott had con­
tacted counsel and had been advised at that point in time
that Mr. Quilloin had no rights.
QUESTION:

But for eleven years he could have

legitimated, could he not?

6

MR. SKINNER:

I think i addressed that issue in

my brief as much as I could.

That is true.

The Georgia statutes concerning birth certificates
provide that the father of an illegitimate child shall not
appear on the birth certificate nor shall the child have his
name unless he consents to this.

It is apparent from the

record that Darrell Webster Quilloin has always been Darrell
Webster Quilloin and not Darrell Webster Williams, which is
the maiden name of Mrs. Walcott.

So he had, in fact, signed

the birth certificate.
QUESTION:

Where was Darrell for that interval

between marriage of the Walcotts and the time he entered
their home?
MR. SKINNER:

I think that he. was — it is some­

what disputed in the record, as Mr. Justice Biackmun will
note.

He was with the maternal grandparents part, of the

time, the paternal grandparents part of the time and with the
Appellant, Mr. Quilloin, part of the time.
QUESTION?

He was net in a home under state cus­

tody or anything like that?
MR. SKINNER£

No, sir.

No, sir.

And let rae point, this out, too, in that regard.
Darrell has naver been a deprived child.

This ia not a case

involving what some people would stereotype an illegitimate
child.

Darrell has been loved r.nd cared for by maternal and

7
paternal grandparents, by the mother, by the father and even
though it may he somewhat contrary to our position, apparently
the stepfather caras for Darrell.

The stepfather did not

file a petition to adopt Darrell until he had been married to
the mother for nine years.
He could have filed immediately.
QUESTION;

Yes?

Mr. Skinner, on this question of

timing, is it not correct that before the Trial Judge entered
his order allowing the adoption and denying the petition to
legitimate, that he would — if he had concluded that it
would have been in the best interests of the child to go with
the natural father, he could then have legitimated the child?
MR. SKINNER:

Under Smith versus Smith, I think

that he could not fail to deny the legitimation because it
was not filed prior to the adoption,
QUESTION;

Do you think that as a matter of law?

MR. SKINNER:
QUESTION:

As a matter of law, yes.

As a matter of law.

Well, then, why did

ha have the — why did he not. deny it at the outset of the
proceeding, I wonder?
MR. SKINNER:

I do not know, other than the fact

that he interpreted Stanley to mean that he had to give
Mr. Quilloin a hearing.

Of course, at the conclusion of the

hearing, fie held that he had no standing which, to me, was
quite puzzling.

3

QUESTION:

What would have been the consequences

of legitimation?
MR. SKINNER:
QUESTION:

All right,- he —

MR. SKINNER:

QUESTION:

MR. SKINNER:

No.

So it does not entitle the person to

veto an adoption?

QUESTION;

Has there ever been a holding in the

Kentucky courts that legitimation entitles a natural father
to veto an adoption?
MR. SKINNER:

No, none that I know of.

Not the Kentucky court.

QUESTION:

Why was it such an Issue in this case,

Why was the Trial Judge asked to legitimate if it did

not bear on the adoption?
MR, SKINNER:

Because I was using that as, in my

opinion,, a defensive tactic.

Also, of course, the nev; adop­

tion statute which is effective January 1st, provides that
this must be filed, that you must file a legitimation to
protect yourself.
QUESTION:

Mr, Skinner, as a practical proposi­

tion, this is mid-November almost.
the line a little bit,

January 1 is just down

Suppose this Court does not get

around to deciding this case before January 1, which it
probably will not.

Then what law attends upon this case?

MR. SKINNER:

Your Honor, at page 24 of the

Appellee’s brief, 1 think the Appellee admits that this would
amount to the right of a grant

in substance, a grant to

Mr, Quilloin of the right to veto the adoption.
The new adoption statuta gives him that right.
QUESTION:

And he complains bitterly about it.

MR. SKINNER:

Yes.

Because of the time sequence,

1C
yes.

And of course, 1 tried to point out in my brief that

the State of Georgia was in the process of passing the new
adoption statute while this case was in actual litigation,
actual trial and I feel that it is clearly now — or will be
on January 1, 1978 — the public policy of the State of
Georgia to give fathers of illegitimate children the right to
legitimate the children after the filing of the adoption
and therefore have standing to object to the adoption.
QUESTION:

It would not necessarily follow from

that that ha would get custody.
MR. SKINNER:
QUESTION:

No.

The ~

It just means that he would have

visitation rights.
MR. SKINNER:

Right.

.And of course, that is all

that we are requesting in this case.

We are not requesting

c ustody.
QUESTION:

Wall, it really sounds as though you

cite requesting what a father being divorced requests.
MR. SKINNER:

Very much so.

We consider

Mr. Quilloin — or I consider him as a de facto divorced
father.

He was never married to the biological mother, of

course but he has acted as if he had been married to her and
divorced.

He has seen the child.

with him.

He has paid money for the child; he has directly

and indirectly.

He has had the child visit

II
He has provided gifts for the child.

Ho has done

everything as far as a nurturing instinct is concerned that
a normal divorced

father would and X feel like that he

should be treated like that.
I do not think that any court would say that
merely because a divorce has been granted? the father of the
child should be eliminated from the picture, unless he is
unfit.

Now, that can be done
QUESTION:

Under Georgia .'Law, he would not be,

would he?
MR. SKINNER:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

Well, calling him a de facto divorced

man does not really change the legal issues in this case.
QUESTION:

Ara you taking the position that he

has supported Darrell all through those years?
MR. SKINNER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Fully?

MR. SKINNER:

Not fully, in the sens® that part of

the support came from, the mother, part of the support came
from the maternal and paternal grandparents.
QUESTION:

I certainly, in scanning the testimony

there, get a different attitude from different people about
what happened.
MR. SKINNER:
QUESTION:

That is true, but --

X realize he bought a ten-speed bike

12
but I am wondering what else he did?
MR. SKINNER:

Well, I think he provided — he

testified that fcha child —
QUESTION:

I know what he testified but what are

the facts?
MR. SKINNER:

I think that is the fact, just what

he said, yes.
QUESTIONi

Superior Court finding number three on

page 71 of the Appendix is that the father has provided
support for the child irregularly in the form of medical
attention, food, clothing, gifts and toys from time to time.
It seems to me you are patting a little bit of a
favorable gloss on that finding in your answer, which I
suppose any attorney is entitled to.
MR. SKINNER:

All right, let me try to support

that with the law, if I may.

In Georgia, there: is a pre­

sumption that a parent is fit and there is, in fact, a pre­
sumption that the parent has not abandoned the child, in my
opinion.

And therefore, the party that has the burden of

proof must proceed and I feel that if there was enough evi~
dence to constitute abandonment, we would not be here today?
that the Trial Court could simply have held that he had aban­
doned the child or that he was unfit and the Trial Court
would not than have had to reach for the constitutional issue,
QUESTION:

What about total lack of support, though?

13

Suppose he had visited the child but never pur­
ported to support, the child at all?

Had been asked to and

either said he would not or he could not?
KR. SKINNER:

Then I think he would have been in a

position to have his rights severed by adoption or by juvenile
court proceedings tc terminate his rights.
QUESTION:

You do not contest that?

MR. SKINNER:

That is not the case here.

Ho, sir.

It is neither a total act of support no:

abandon­

ment .
QUESTION:

Well, suppose it is perfectly clear

that he cannot support the child totally — that h ; can, say,
give $20 a month.
MR. SKINNER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

But that that is not anywheres near

sufficient.
MR. SKINNER:

He would not be deprived of the

custody then because he would be doing the best lie could and
I think that no court would ever require somebody to do more
than they would foe able to do.
QUESTION:

And that is —

Well, a child is

still very needy and

the stepfather wants to adopt him and provide for him..
MR. SKINNER:

Well, the fact is, of course, in

this case, the stepfather and the biological mother are
providing for Darrell in soma degree.

14
QUESTION:

Well, can Darrell inherit from the

stepfather?
MR. SKINNER:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

Unless he is adopted, he cannot?

MR. SKINNER:

No, sir.

There is a way, of course, Justice White.

Of

course, the stepfather can make a will and leave him his
entire estate, if he so desires and of course *--•
QUESTION:

That potentiality does not give the

child any right in the terms that Justice White was address­
ing, does it?
MS. SKINNER:
QUESTION:

No, sir, it would not —

Anyone can make a will leaving money

to the child.
MR. SKINNER:

That is true.

So could Mr. Quilloin.

But in this case — of course, under Trimble versus Gordon,

MR. SKINNER;

somewhat ambiguous about the amount of support that was in­

QUESTION;

Well, I do not think the finding is

The finding, the one that Mr. Justice

Rehnquist read to you, is that the principal or primary
support cn a regular basis has been the mother or the mater­
nal grandparents.

Yes.

MR. SKINNER;

Well, will you accept that hero'3

To soma extent I think you can but

I think that the record should ba looked at as e

whole.

There was no finding of abandonment, as I am pointing out.
Of course, Georgia has held that the failure of
one parent to support a child where support is neither
requested or needed is not an abandonment so there was no
abandonment by Mr. Quilloin.

And that is a pretty clear rule

a rule in law in Georgia that carae out of a case, involving
custody of ei illegitimate- child where the mother lest

Mr. Skinner, while you are interrupted,

you mentioned earlier that, as a matter of Georgia law, the
filing of the petition to legitimate came too late because it
came after the adoption petition had been filed.

QUESTION:

MR. SKINNER:

No, but I think that, the record

living together at that time.
QUESTION:

Right.

What I am really driving at is,

what have you got to gain, really, 30 far as the child is
concerned by prevailing in this case?
What is your ultimate objective?
MR. SKINNER:

My ultimate objective is far him to

have soma visitation rights with the child, which he had up
until very recently before this adoption —
QUESTION:

Dess he have no visitation rights?

MR. SKINNER:
QUESTION:

Sir?

Does he have no visitation rights?

MR. SKINNER:

Absolutely none.

QUESTION: Right.
MR. SKINNER:

Absolutely none.

Because he has not

seen the child since the filing of this document.
But the record is quite clear that the purpose
of the filing of this adoption action was not the purpose
stated.

The purpose of filing this adoption action was to

get rxd of Mr. Quillom out of the life of this family.

Of

20
course, they did not file this adoption because Mr. Quilloin
had abandoned the child,

They filed this adoption because

they were concerned of the overbalance of things that were
being received by Darrell from Mr. Quilloin as opposed to
their seven“year-old biological child of the Appellees.
QUESTION:

Now, when you characterise the adoption

as being for the purpose you have just mentioned, is it not
reasonable to say that the purpose of the adoption by the
foster father was to give the child something that the bio­

that it would be a completely different case.

and particularly at 694 which held: "This Court has many
times held under facts similar to those in the instant case
that the mere failure of a parent to provide support for a
minor child when in the possession or custody of the other
parent, a grandparent or ether persons, when no support is
requested or needed, is not such a failure to provide

I think that perhaps this would answer Justice Marshall's
questions concerning abandonment* too, in this issue.
QUESTIONs

Well, then I understand that if a man

has a child and for fifteen years he did not give a red
rickle to the child, he cannot be said to have abandoned the
child.
MR. SKINNER:

I think not, under this ruling.

But that is not the case in this case with this man here.
QUESTION:

Well, what would that be?

MR. SKINNER:

Disowning?

Under Georgia law it would not be an

abandonment as per Pettiford versus Mott.
QUESTION:

The parent of the child who gives

nothing for a period of years, a long period of years, can

state.

All you have got to tell me is

Of course, he has voluntarily done things — of

because no support was ever requested and there was no father
in the family in this case.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Jones..

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS F. JONES, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
■» ■'

MR. JONES;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
Appellant is here because he contends that the
adoption of his child without his consent violates his due
process rights.
We conte .id that this position is untenable in view
of the existence or Georgia Cods Section 74-103 which pro­
vides that the father of an illegitimate child can legitimate
that child at

any time.

Once this child is legitimated, he

is legitimate for all purposes, including inheritance, in­
ducing the objection to adoption and perhaps most important QUESTION:

Well, you and your colleague, tnen, do

differ on the consequences of legitimation.

You think that

if a child is legitimated, the father who does the legiti­
mating has the right to veto an adoption?
MR. JONES:

Yes, this is our position, Lour Honor.

Since Appellant did not take the step a; d legiti­
mise the chi-tcl, he cannot have the right to argue that

he

30

has been denied due process.

He had an opportunity for this

due process for eleven years and he did not choose to dc it.
As I stated previously, when a child is illegitimate, the father's consent is not required and Georgia Code
Section 74-403 states that if the child is illegitimate,
only the mother's consent is necessary.
Appellant

has also contended that there is an

equal protection violation here because he says chat Georgici
law burdens all unwed fathers.

Our position is that this

is not the case.
There are two classes involved here:

fathers of

legitimate children and fathers of illegitimate children.
Appellant is in the second class because of his own choice.
He could have investigated the situation, gotten an attorney
and found put exactly what his rights were and what he
needed to do to protect them.
Now, there is a distinction made between these
two classes.

We would submit that this distinction is made

based on a valid state interest.

That state interest is

Georgia's interest in the welfare of its children and Geor­
gia's interest in the protection and stability of the family
unit.
In that connection, Your Honor, I would like to
request that the Court consider the effects of a decision
in the Government's favor and how it would affect adoptions

V

31
all over'the country.

If fathers of illegitimate children,

if their consent was required, many adoptions which should
take place would not take place.
There would he problems of locating the fathers.
There would he problems of the father just not consenting.
There would also be the potential problem of profit-seeking
in order to obtain an adoption.
We submit that the most important fe,ctor here is
the best interest of the child.
QUESTION:

Is it relevant at all fox purposes of

this statute —- assuming the purposes then become important —
that it is relatively easy to identify the mother of any
illegitimate child?

It is not always sc easy to i enfcxfy the

father.
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

X believe the
Does that not underlie the illegitimacy

statutes?
MR. JONES:

I agree totally, Mr. Chief Justice

and this relates to the problems I was speaking of a little
bit ago.

If states had the burden of, number cue, locating

well, number one, determining who these fathers are and then
locating them so that their consent could be obtained before
any adoption, of an illegitimate child could take place, many,
\o.any deserving children will not get their home environment
that they denerve.

32
QUESTION:

But that is not true in this case.

MR. JONES:

No, that is not true in this case.

In this case, Georgia has a policy which X believe reflects
this Court’s decision in Stanley versus Illinois.
The Georgia Department of Family and Children's
Services makes every effort fcc locate the fathers of illegi­
timate children -QUESTION:

Well, in this casa I thought he ad­

mitted it.
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

He did admit it.
On the record, so that it; not in this

case at all.
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

No, no, it is not in this case.
Is the Georgia Family and Children's

Service Department that you just referred to

brought in in

most or all of the adoption cases in Georgia?
MR. JOKES:

Yes, they are, Your Honor.

K report

is submitted f.r ora this department to the Superior Court judge
on ail petitions for adoption in Georgia.

This report con-

tains the depattraent s recommendations concerning the bast
interests of the child.
As I have stated previously, the courts of Georgia
ard the legislature of Georgia

have stated that this adop­

tion is in the best interest of the child.

The father has

not provided any significant support for this child for 12

33

years.
QUESTION;

Are you defending a rule —* the auto­

matic rule that the father of an illegitimate child is auto­
matically not given standing to object to an adoption simply
because he has not legitimated the child?
MR. JONES:
Your Honor.

Well, I would answer that this way,

There may be somewhere a father who deserves

consideration.
QUESTIONs

Well, suppose that there had been no

finding in this case and no basis for finding that he had
failed to support at all?

That he had regularly seen the

children and he had regularly supported them fully and com­
pletely.

The only thing, the mother had remarried and they

wanted an adoption.
MR. JONES:

Your Honor, I would think that the

only father who was deserving of consideration is one who has
done all he can to legitimate or adopt that child.
QUESTION;

So you say yes, you do defend the auto­

matic rule, even though he has completely supported the child?
MR. JONES:

I will say this, Your Honor, I believe

that the interests of the child are raore important and in a
factual situation such as this, 1 would defend that broad
policy.
QUESTION:
it not?

Well, that is what the court held, Is

34
MRa JONES:

Yes, it is.

I would also like to refer the Court: to page 67
of the Appendix in this case which -QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, in that connection — that

is, with your last answer, is that reconcilable: with your
statement in the brief as I read it that if this case gets
caught under the new statute, it is lost.
MR. JONES:

Your Honor, that is -— or maybe I

should say was my initial reading of that statute.

In that

connection, I would like to refer tie Court to page 23 of
Appellee *s brief in which the relevant portion of the new
section is stated.
This is the new section 74-405 which will become
effective on January .1 next year.

This section states that

"The surrender or termination of parental rights by consent or
otherwise shall not be required as a prerequisite in the case
of e. parent who has failed significantly without justifiable
cause for a period of one year or longer Immediately prior
to the filing of petition for adoption, number one, to com­
municate or to make a bona fide attempt to communicate with
the child or, number two, to provide for the care and support
of the child as required by law or judicial decree,"
If is m contested in this case that Appellant has
never supported the child.

He is required to do sc- by

Section 74-202 of the Georgia Code which requires that the

35
father of an illegitimate child is required to support that
child.
Therefore,. I see a potential question of fact here
and the Georgia Court might have to decide whether he has
failed significantly without justifiable cause.

These words

of qualification, as I say, may raise a question of fact but
I would still hold to my initial impression that there is a
very good chance that this adoption will not take place if
it is decided under the new law which becomes effective
January 1.
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:

It will not take place, you feel?
This is my initial impression.

As I

say, a question of fact may arise under the section I just
•

stated.
QUESTION:

Well, a question of fact would.

But

you say that there is a finding that, he has failed to support
the child.
MR. JONES:

But there are words of qualification.

Your Honor, whether he has “significantly and without justi­
fiable cause,
The courts of Georgia might take the position,
although I think it would be untenable, they might take the
«
position that, well, since someone else was caring for the
child, it was not necessary for him to support.
QUESTION:

Well, what would be the place of

36
legitimation under the new statute?

Just because he had

legitimated the child would not automatically c/ive him a
right to object to the adoption if he had failed to support,
MR. JONES:
Honor.

I would have to agree with that,, Your

But we contend that this case should be decided under
%

the present statute for two reasons:
Number one, the present statute adequately pro­
tects the rights of Appellant, both his due process and equal
protection rights.
Secondly, it would be a manifest injustice in the
strongest sense of the word to apply an adoption statute to
a case to a new adoption statute which becomes effective 21
months, fully 21 months after the original filing of the
petition for adoption,
I think there is adequate authority in the cases
of this Court to allow you to decide under the present sta­
tute.1 .
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose you could support this

judgment: without defending the automatic rule.
MR, JONES:

Yes, very easily.

As I was saying before —

The only possibility of this case being decided

under the new statute would be this Court's general policy

QUESTION:

That is a matter of federal law, is

think this Court has control over its own decision and would

worlds.

He wants the immortality — if you cart call it that --

not want to satisfy the obligations that are attendant with
this relationship.

He wants to have his cake and eat it, too.

the state's preliminary brief at the time the juristor..

This is correct.

This is correct.

adopted name, ever since the decision in this case.

as

Is he living with the Walcotts?
He is still living with the Walcotts

-he has for the last seven years.

The child began using

that, name after the order of adoption was entered hut before
my opponent filed his appeal.
QUESTION:

Mr. Jones?

MR. JONES:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

I understood from what Counsel for

Appellant stated that his real objective is to obtain visita­
tion rights.

Did the Georgia court have the power, under

Georgia law, to accord visitation rights under the present
statute?

i assumed that it did in view of the order entered

denying those rights.

MR. JONES:

I would agree.

X believe that the

court would have had the authority to allow visitation rights
but the court found that these rights would not be in the
best interest of the child.
QUESTION:

Right.

But would not a Georgia court

have that same authority under the new statute?
MR. JONES:

Your Honor, under the new statute, I

believe that the primary emphasis is on the adoption.
QUESTION:

But even so, take the case of an ab~

solute divorce in ■— certainly in my stata of Virginia, the
court would have full authority to allow visitation rights
to the father after he no longer had any custody.

It would

depend on the best interest of the child, as you have said.
What I am driving at is, so far as visitation
rights are concerned, under Georgia law, does it make any
difference which statute is applied?
MR. JONES:

Our position would be that no, it

does not matter.
QUESTION:

Under Georgia law you have, no visita­

tion rights are feasible if chare has been an adoption.
QUESTION:

No, not after an adoption.

QUESTION:

How is that?

Is that true under Georgia

law?
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

Excuse me, sir?
Is that true under Georgia law, if there

46
has been an adoption, there are no visitation rights?
That was my
MR. JONES:

second question.
Your Honor, my analysis of the statute

does not reveal any statement regarding visitation .rights if
an adoption is granted either under the old or the new star

tute since all domestic relations actions involve the equity
jurisdiction of the court.

My initial reaction would be that

the court certainly would have the jurisdiction to do any­
thing it thought appropriate.

giving parental rights to the adoptive father, they would

Does that not sound as though he, at least,
thought that you might have an adoption and strll grant

the facts.

I understand that.

But is there prece

in Georgia? in the sequence 1' described, for allowing tl
