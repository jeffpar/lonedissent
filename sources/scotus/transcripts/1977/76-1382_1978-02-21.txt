MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear first this

morning Number 76-1382, United abates against Scott.
Mr. Frey, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT- OF ANDREW L. FREY, EfaQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FREY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:.
This case is here on writ of certiorari to review the
judgment of the Court of Appeals for the uixth Circuit dis­
missing the Government's appeal in this case which was taken
from an order of the District Court which dismissed Count I
of the indictment against Respondent on grounds of pr?judic4"
pre-indictment d elay.
The relevant facts are simple and may be summarized
briefly.

In March 1975* Respondent was charged in a three-

count indictment with distributing controlled.substances on
three separate occasions, cocaine on September 20, 1974, codeine
on September 24, 1974, and heroin on January 22, 1975.

he

moved before trial to dismiss the first two counts on due
process grounds, alleging prejudicial pre-indictment delay.
The motion v/as denied with the proviso that it could be renewed
after presentation of evidence at trial.

It was renewed and

again denied at the close of the prosecution's case, at which
time a motion for a judgment of acquittal was also denied, the

4
court indicating that the prosecution had put on enough evidence
to take the question of Respondent's guilt or innocence to
the jury»

The pre*» indictment delay motion was again renewed

after the defense had rested and this time it was granted.
The United states then sought an appeal.
he are concerned here solely with the dismissal of
Count I.

The court granted Respondent’s motion to dismiss that

count on the basis of delay, finding that there had been an in­
tentional delay by the Government in bringing the charge for
the improper purpose of accumulating evidence of other crimes
by the Respondent,and that the delay of five and one-half months

r

had prejudiced the Respondent because it had interfered with his
ability to recollect the events of the date on which the offense
a11 egediy occurred,
QUESTION:

Mr» Prey, Count IX is entirely out of the

reverse the dismissal of our appeal as to Count XX.
Xr. light of this Court's subsequent decision in
United htates v. Lovaseq, the dismissal was indisputably
erroneous.

The question this Court must decide is whether the

United states is entitled to correction of the error by an
appeal.

And, of course, whether the United States can appeal

depends on whether the Double Jeopardy Clause would bar a
second trial of Respondent, if the appeal were successful.

Now, let me approach this question first by describing
some of the legal terrain that this Court has traversed in the
last several years and by positioning the present case on the
double jeopardy landscape.
The issue in the present case is akin to those
recently decided by the Court in cases such as Vlilson, Jenkins,
Dinitz, Martin Linen, Lee and Finch and which it now has before
it in Sonabria.

As a result of these decisions, the Court haa

authoritatively answered many questions.

For instance, Wilson

made clear that the Government could appeal a dismissal or an
aquittai that followed a jury verdict of guilty when success on
appeal would not require a second trial.
On the other hand, Jenkins, Martin Linen and Finch
established that in most, if not all, other circumstances the
Louble Jeopardy clause confers upon defendants in criminal
cases an interest in retaining the benefits of a post»jeopardy
acquittal by either judge or jury, whether or not the acquittal
is legally or factually correct.

This interest precludes a

Government appeal to review the propriety of such acquittals.
Dinitz and Lee, on the other hand, established that
a mid-trial termination,not amounting to an acquittal on the
merits, if requested by the defendant, does not bar a second
trial, at least as long as the termination is of a kind that
allows or contemplates the possibility of further prosecution.
QUESTION:

Mr. Frey, you are not suggesting that all

6
of the authoritative answers, as you refer to them, that have
been given by this Court to these questions are consistent with
one another, are you?
MR, FR&Y:

No, 1 am not, but they have at least-

established a group of cubby-holes in which certain situations
can be placed,

We know what the rules are, -'.Unless'this Court

is prepared to re-examine any of the cases — I think there is
some inconsistency in rationales, but nevertheless some clear
strains of decision or lines of policy that I will attempt to
elucidate that shed considerable light on the proper outcome
of this case.
This case falls in an as yet unexplored middle
ground.

On the one hand, it plainly does not involve an

acquittal under any acceptable definition of the term.

Unlike

Jenkins, unlike Martin Linen, unlike Finch, there was here no
determina tic n that Respondent did not coimi.it the offense that
he -.as charged with.

Nor was there a resolution in Respondent’s

favor of anj .facts relating to the question of guilt or inno­
cence.

There may be cases, such as Senabria, in which it is

difficult to tell whether there has been an acquittal, but
this is not such a cose.
Instead, there was here simply a determination that,
regardless of Respondent's guilt or innocence, wholly independent
factors preclude his conviction.
QUESTION:

How was it denominated by the District

7
Judge?
MR0 FREY:
QUESTION:

It was a dismissal.
Dismissal or the grant of a motion to

dismiss and a dismissal.
MR, FREY:

I believe that's correct.

QUESTION:

I think it was just a dismissal.

It

didn't say "motion," I don't believe, did it?
MR. FREY:

Well, there was a motion which was made

prior to trial -*-■*
QUESTION:

But I mean his statement was just a

d i smissa 1, wa s n 11 it?
MR. FREY:

It was a dismissal of the indictment,

which would be the proper remedy if the legal grounds were
c orrec t.
Thus, the case is holding then an acquittal"may not
be reviewed on appeal where a second trial would result from
a reversal are not controlling here.

On the other hand, this

case is not necessarily controlled by the mistrial dismissal
cases, such as Din it?, and Lee.

Those cases can be distinguished

from this case on the ground that there the termination of the
first trial did not result from a ruling that,
bar further prosecution of the charge.

was

if correct, would

Unlike what the Court

able to. say in Lee, the Court could not say here that the

ruling of the District Court was the functional equivalent of
a mistrial

8
Nevertheless,, we submit that the instant ease is
markedly closer in almost all material respects to the
mistrial dismissal line of cases than to the acquittal line,
and, accordingly, that the Government's appeal and the ensuing
retrial If the appeal succeeds, are not barred by the Double
Jeopardy Clause,
Now, I would like to turn to a consideration of the
relevant double jeopardy policies in an attempt to demonstrate
why those policies are served rather than offended by allowing
the Government's appeal in this case.
The history of the Court's double jeopardy juris­
prudence reflects a continuing effort to strike an appropriate
balance between competing interests, on the .one hand, the
interests of society In conducting fair trials ending in just
judgments which subsumes the societal interests that the
guilty should be punished for their crimes, on the other hand,
the interests of the individual to be sheltered from the anxiety
and expense of'multiple trials to avoid multiple punishments
for a single offense and to preserve a determination at trial
that he is not guilty of the offense charged.
None of these interests is absolute.

Thus, society's

interest in legally just and factually accurate trial outcomes
is required to yield to the double jeopardy interests of an
acquitted defendant, even though the acquittal may, for
instance, be the product of a palpably erroneous jury

9
instruction.

On the other hand, whatever interests the defen­

dant has in preserving an acquittal must yield in situations
like hiIson or like Serfass where he has not yet been placed
in jeopardy when the acquittal occurs.
As to the central double jeopardy interests of the
defendant in avoiding multiple trials, it is well settled that
that interest, too, must give way in at least three types of
circumstances.

The first is where the defendant has been con»

vie ted and the conviction is reversed or set aside subsequently.
The second is where as a result of prosecutorial or judicial
error the defendant elects to move for a mistrial that ■Gemin­
ates the first trial.

And the third is where the trial is

terminated even over the defendant's objection because circum­
stances make such termination manifestly necessary.
Now, in all of the cases involving the permissibility
of a second trial or of a Government appeal, the interests of
the defendant that could allow him to prevail have fit within
two categories.
fl'JiSTION:

When you speak of the manifest necessity

doctrine, is that not coupled with the interests of justice
both to the public and the accused?
MRo FRhY:

Yes, of course, it's the --

CUKSTIQN:

Balancing process, isn’t it?

MR, FRAY:

Yes, it is a balancing process, and the

point I was attempting to suggest is that the interest in

10

avoiding multiple trials is not absolute.

It inquires a

balance of the societal interest in public justice against the
individual interest in avoiding repetitious litigation.

And

the manifest necessity termination is an effort to strike that
balance in a situation where the trial has had to terminate
because of a hung jury or acts of war, as in Wade v. Hunter,
and in other circumstances that are justifiable to override
the defendant!s right in avoiding multiple trial®.
X gather you decided a case this morning that
involves that very question.
If X could come back to the concept that there are
two kinds of interests of the defendant which, I think, it can
be shown are not
case.

neither of which is implicated in this

The first interest which was deemed controlling in

Ball, Kapner, Jenkins, Martin Linen, Finch is the intereat in
preserving an acquittal if the defendant is able to obtain one.
Nov/, as I've indicated, that interest is not at all involved in
this care, tinea Respondent most definitely was not exonerated
of the charge of cocaine distribution.
The second interest, which is central to the mistrial
dismissal line of cases and which prevailed in such cases as
Downum and. corn, is the valued right of the defendant to obtain
a verdict at the first trial, if he wants one.

Cases implicating

this interest — such factors a® whether the defendant has
agreed to the termination of the first trial and if he has

11

resisted it to whether the termination was nevertheless neces­
sary to serve the ends of public justice.
If, as in Dinifcz and .bee, he has sought the pre­
verdict termination, it is difficult to conclude that a second
trial should be barred on the grounds of an unjustified depri­
vation of the defendant's right to obtain a verdict at the first
trial.
Now, Respondent Scott, like Dinifcz and Lee, did not
have his right to settle his dispute with society once and for
all at the first trial taken away from him.

Ke could have had

a verdict, but he preferred instead a termination on a ground
unrelated to his guilt or innocence.
Since the appeal does not —
QUESTION:

Could I interrupt?

MR. FREY:

Sure.

QUESTION:

There are two interests, one to preserve

the interest in the acquittal and the second is to go to the
jury in the first trial.

The second point you say is not --

Vihy isn't the interest in preserving an acquittal
very similar to the interest defendant might have if, say,
there were an appeal on final judgment entered here?

If there

had been an appeal.and we said you could appeal and- thcrs .it was
finally judged

that one trial was too late, he couldn’t be

retried then either.

Why isn’t it the same --

MR. FR^Y: The principle of res judicata --

12

QUESTION:

Isn't that principle of res judicata part

of what the Double Jeopardy Clause protects?
MR. FRJY:

I would agree that it's an important part

of what the Double Jeopardy Clause protects, but it simply is
inapplicable where you have an appeal,
QUESTION:

Let me pvt it a little differently*

say the first interest is in preserving an acquittal,

You

Why

doesn't the defendant have an interest in preserving any
favorable resolution of the trial after he has been put in
jeopardy?
MR, B’RLY:

Well, the question is whether he has an

interest that this Court has recognized or is now prepared to
recognize should override the societal interest in correcting
error and in obtaining a determination of his guilt or innocence.
After all, the principal purpose of the trial itself on which
the Double Jeopardy Clause focuses is to secure a determination,
accurate if possible, of the defendant’s guilt or innocence.
When there has been a determination that he is not guilty,
this Court has, taken the view,

last-term in Martin Linen and

in Finch -•* that that determination vests in the defendant an
indefeasible interest that the Government can’t attack.

It

has nothing to do with res judicata, it seems to me, because
we cannot appeal, we cannot seek review of errors that may have
underlain the acquittal.

But I think the reason that has a

special status is because it is a determination that the

13

defendant is not guilty.

And I think that the Court has come

to the conclusion that that kind of determination is something
that the Court is not prepared to see attacked in the means
that would require a second trial.
QUESTION:

Perhaps that *s right, but is it not correct

that the defendant does have an interest at least in preserving
a favorable judgment, even though it’s not a determination of
innocence?
MR» FREY:

I donct question that he has an interest,

but I think it is clear **QUESTION:

It *8 not constitutionally protected, is

what you are saying?
MR. FREY:

Well, it is clear from the Wilson case

that the Interest in preserving the favorable judgment is not,
itself, constitutionally protected by the Double Jeopardy
Clause, because in ?. ils_on the defendant got the very same kind
of ruling that this defendant got here, and -QUESTION:

After a verdict of guilty.

MR. FRDY:

After a verdict of guilty.

But he had

the same interest in preserving it from attack on appeal, yet
the Court allowed the appeal because it was concerned with
multiple trials and not the right to preserve a favorable
ruling.

And there is some discussion of the Court;s opinion

in Wilson which indicates that
QUESTION:

His interest there was in not being tried

14
twice.

And here, if you prevail, he will be tried twice.
MR* FRoY:

I intend to discuss the reasons why his

interest in not being tried twice is no different from hoe's
interest in not being tried twice.
There are two separate interests that you mention.
One is the interest in preserving a favorable decision.

As

to that interest, X maintain -» and I think the Court's deci­
sions, particularly hi Is on, support rue — that that Interest
applies to acquittals in a different way from the way it applies
to other kinds of favorable rulings.
As to the interest in avoiding multiple trials, that
is always an interest of a defendant, and that fs an interest
in the mistrial situation, that's an interest in the Lee
dismissal situation, that's an interest in this situation.
What I am suggesting is that it is not an interest of sufficient
force to override the public interest in having won determination
of the defendant's guilt or innocence.
Now, while this case is technically distinguishable
from Lee on the basis of the nature of the order terminating
the prosecution, we submit that it is controlled by the same
policies, and that they dictate the same result.

Neither in

Lee nor in this case: did the defendant secure a favorable
resolution on the merits that might be supplanted by a second
trial.

And in both cases the pre-verdict termination was in

response to the defendant's own motion and with his consent.

15
Now, we recognize that there is dictum in Lee
seemingly pointing to a different result.

I refer to the

following statement which appears at page 30 of 432 U.S.:
"Where a mid-trial dismissal is granted on the ground, correct
or not, that the defendant simply cannot be convicted of the
offehse charged, Jenkins establishes that further prosecution
is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause. "
This was such a dismissal.

But we believe that the

statement in Lee which was not necessary to the Court's decision
there, was never intended to govern cases such as the present
one.

Two reasons support this conclusion.
QUESTION:

Apparently, then, Jenkins doesn't?

MR. PREY:

Jenkins is not controlling here at all,

because Jenkins was an acquittal, that is, Jenkins was a
determination that Mr. Jenkins had not committed an offense
under the Selective Service laws because Ay lard was not retro­
active.
Now, the first reason why the Lee dictum is not
applicable here is that it was a completely accurate statement
of the situation in Lee where there was no Government appeal,
do that if the ruling in Lee had been a dismissal with prejudice,
or a determination of the merits of the controversy, the second
trial in Lee would have been barred by the Double Jeopardy
Clause,
the case.

Here we have a Government appeal which distinguishes

16

QUESTION:

It's the fact of the Government appeal

that makes It necessary to make an Inquiry into whether or not
the second trial is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause,
because that is the test of whether or not the Government can
appeal,
MR, PREY:

I understand that there is a double

jeopardy issue —
QUESTION:

That's the only issue, because that's the

test of whether or not the Government can properly appeal.
MR, FREY:

But in Lee there was a res judicata issue

that had to be answered, that is, was the decision of the
District Court dismissing the indictment in Lee a final determin­
ation of the controversy that -would become final by res judicata
principles if there was a failure to appeal.

If that was true

in Lee, then a second trial would have been barred by the
Double Jeopardy Clause.

Do that, what I am saying is that

the statement in Lee can be perfectly well understood

Jeopardy Clause,

ld

that the statement in Lee would be accurate

if we had proceeded by means of a second trial rather than an
appeal.
Nov/, apart from this point ~~ and I recognize that
Lee cites Jenkins and Jenkins was a Government appeal case -we think that what the Court was doing in Lee was contrasting
the dismissal in Lee with the dismissal in Jenkins which was in
the nature of an acquittal, that is, a determination that the
defendant had not committed the crime with which he was charged.
We don't think that the Court had in mind this special sub­
category of cases involved in Scott,and I assume the fact that
certiorari was granted is some indication that the matter was
not wholly settled by the statement in j-.ee.
Moreover, so long as the case does not implicate a
defendant’s special interest in preserving a determination that
he is not guilt?/ of the offense charged, there is no good reason
for distinguishing among various types of dismissals for pur»
poses or determining the permissibility of a second trial.
All dismissals that do not determine guilt or innocence ought
to be analyzed in the same way.
Why should a trial court's erroneous dismissal on the
grounds of pre-indictment delay, statute of limitations or
discriminatory prosecution bar second trial, although a dis­
missal for some other defect in the indictment or the trial
does not?

We think there is no good reason.

In either type of

18

case, the defendant is exposed as a result of the second trial
to the same amount of added anxiety and expense and the prosecu­
tion is afforded precisely the same opportunity to improve upon
its original presentation.
QUESTION:

Exactly what are we talking about when we

say "double jeopardy"?

In this case, there is no way that this

man can escape without two trials, under your theory?

would be affirmed.
QUESTION:

But your position is it was not correct?

MR. FREY:

Well, that's right.

In that case, he gets two trials.

MR. FREY:

That is our position and that, of course,

is what happened in Lee.
QUESTION:

I

MR. PREY:

Well, that's true but, as I've tried to

point out earlier in my argument, the Double Jeopardy Clause
is not an absolute prohibition against two trials.
QUESTION:
jeopardy.

It is not a prohibition against double

19

MR» FREY:

Well, if you want to put it that way.

Indeed, this case is stronger for the Government than Lee for
the very reason that you dissented from the Lee decision, be­
cause in Lee the second trial was needed, at least in part,
because of the negligence of the prosecutor In framing the
charge.

Whereas, here, the prosecutor did nothing wrong.

He

brought a perfectly adequate charge and it was the Respondent,
by inducing the court to commit legal error, who prevented a
verdict at the first trial.
QUESTION:

Gould the judge have done this on his own

That's why I said he didn’t grant that

I believe that he did grant the defendant's

I don't believe that this is a case that can be treated

like Jorn as one in which the judge suddenly pops up and stops
the trial.
QUESTION:

That's right.

QUESTION:

My understanding of the record Is that

the defendant made a motion to dismiss at the outset of the
trial and the trial judge reserved judgment and then he made

20

it at the close of the Government's case, reserved judgment,, and
made it at the close of the defendant's case and granted,
MR. FREY:

I think technically it was denied, but it

was denied with the understanding that it would be considered
at a subsequent point in the trial.
QUESTION:

But you really don't see that there is

any material difference, whether the motion is continued or
whether the motion is subsequently -- It doesn't make any
difference with you?
MR. FREY:

I don't think so.

In this case, the

judge said, "I hereby grant the motion to dismiss with respect
to Count I."
QUESTION:

I don’t think it makes any difference in

your argument.
MR, FREY:

Well, it would make a difference if, as

in United States v. Jorn, the judge suddenly popped up and
said, "t am declaring a mistrial," and before the defendant
could say anything the jurors were discharged.
QUESTION:

Or if he said, "I also acquit."

MR. FREY:

Well, if he said, "I acquit," then you

have a different problem, but he most positively did not say it.
QUESTION:

If he had said it in this case, you would

be making the same argument, wouldn't you?
MB, FREY:

If he said he acquitted?

X think Serfass makes it clear that the label has no

21
talismanic effect, but if what he did was an acquittal, that is,
if xMhat he did was a judgment, however, wrong, that the defen­
dant had not committed the offense we would not be here today*
QUESTION:

You wouldn’t be here because what he did

was correct.
MR» FREY:
did was correct.

In a sense, we don’t know whether what he

We believe it was incorrect.

QUESTION:

You said, very early in the argument,

that it was palpably incorrect.

What's --

MR„ FREY:

In light of Lovasco.

QUESTION:

Why do you say that?

Because there was

a finding both that this was deliberate conduct on the part of
the Government and that there was resulting prejudice.
MR. FREY:

Well, I understand that the ingredients

of the formula were recited but the delay was the kind of delay
-- five and one-half months ~~ which normally doesn't even
trigger an inquiry and the rubric nature of the. delay was the
very kind of thing which .is normally recognised as the jore
kind of appropriate delay to protect the identity of an infor­
mant, to further investigate to find out the Identity of any
potential confederates, the source of supply of the narcotics,
and so on.
I don’t want to argue at length -QUESTION:

No, because in any event, even if it was

arguably correctly decided and correctly dismissed, your only

22

claim is you had a right to appeal.

The merits of that don't

really have anything to do with what is the issue now before

us.
MR» FR.IY:

That's correct.

Now, if this Court upholds the dismissal of the
Government's appeal in this case, the result will be to sacri­
fice the societal interest in a full and fair trial reaching a
just judgment, without achieving any corresponding benefits of
the legitimate interests of criminal defendants.

No one is

asking here that Respondent choose between his right to have an
adjudication of his due process claim and his right to have the
merits of the charges against him determined at a single trial.
Both goals could readily have been achieved by the simple ex­
pedient of deferring the ruling on the motion to dismiss until
after the verdict.
matter is finished.

If that is done and the jury acquits, the
If that is done and the jury convicts,

the trial judge can then grant or deny the motion.

The correct­

ness of that ruling can be reviewed on appeal by either side,
and, regardless of the outcome of the appeal, no second trial
will be necessary on account cf this issue.
QUESTION:

Mr. Frey, before you sit down, would you

tell me why Jenkins isn’t controlling?
MR. FREY:

Because Jenkins involved what was really

an acquittal.
QUESTION:

But. the. very last page of the opinion says

23
"We can't tell whether there was an acquittal or not."

There

was nc resolution of factual issue and assuming either way there
is still no appeal,
MR, FREY:

But Jenkins was a case in which the reason

the Court -- What the Court, was dealing with was a point which
I am afraid is now mooted by the Finch decision which is whether
if the judge had found every fact necessary to support a conviction, and had then applied a legally erroneous theory to
produce an acquittal, that acquittal or dismissal, as the judge
labeled it in that case, would be reviewable on appeal.
Now, what the Court said was that it couldn't tell
from the record exactly what the judge was doing, but -QUESTION:

Therefore, it didn't make any difference

for the purpose of the decision, isn't that -MR, FREY:

That was because, whatever he was doing, it

was a determination of the defendant's culpability, liability,
for the offense charged, that is, did he or did he not commit
an offense, was something that the judge determined.

-And there

was some question as to exactly how he determined it, exactly
what facts-he found, but 1 don't think it was anything like
this case, where the decision to dismiss had nothing to do with
whether the defendant committed the crime.

It had merely to do

with whether he was prejudiced in his ability to defend, and so
on.

He could be guilty, he could be innocent. That was not

true in Jenkins.

24

QUESTION:
quickly.

Let me ask you one other question rather

If I understand your theory correctly, you would also

say the Government could appeal if the dismissal, say, were on
a ground that there had been prosecutorial misconduct or some­
thing of that kind?
MR. PREY:

I hate to get into that at this point.

QUESTION:

I think it would follow from your theory,

but on ihe other hand you say it could not appeal if the -»
say there had been a dismissal at the close of the Government’s
case because the judge thought there was not enough evidence to
go to the jury.

You would not be able to appeal that.

MR. FREY:

We take that to be the teaching of

Martin Linen, yes ,
I would just like to sum up the way I see the equities
of the

2resent

case.

It seems to me that the public has a right

under the Double Jeopardy Clause to expose a defendant in a
criminal case to at least one determination of guilty or
innocence, and that defendants should not be permitted to
defeat that important interest by injecting error into a trial,
halting it short of verdict and then complaining that exposure
to another trial would be unjust and excessively costly to thems elves.
1 would like to reserve the balance of my time.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Marietti.

Very well, Mr. Frey.

25

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM C. MARIETTI, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR, MARIETTI:

Mr. Chief Justice, anti may it please

the Court:
I would like to confine my discussion with the Court
this morning to rebutting the brief submitted by the Government
in this case.

And, as far as our positive position in this

case, I would like to rely on my brief in this matter anti I
don't intend to reiterate that.
I think it is meet, for the Court in launching a
discussion in the consideration of this case to first consider
what we do know about this case anti what there is apparent
agreement upon between both the Government and the Respondent.
Now, It is clearxthat this case does not fall within
the ambit of the Serfass decision which is part anti parcel of
the trilogy which this Court recently has decided.

The Wilson,

Jenkins, Serfass trilogy, as the Court has referred to them,
in the Lee decision.

*

It is clear we don't have Serfass here because we
have jeopardy attaching. And I read the Serfass decision as
making that determination the critical factor anti the reason
for the decision in Serf ass tc permit a retrial of the defen­
dant .
In this case, the defendant, Mr. Scott, was put to
trial both with regard to the Government's proofs and to the

26

defendant’s proofs.

And as to Count III which is not before

the Court it was sent to the jury,

So that jeopardy has

attached under the Down urn decision once that jury was impaneled,
once they began to consider the evidence.
I think it is also clear that we don’t have the
situation that we had in Lee cr the situation that the Court
was concerned about in the Sisson decision, where counsel merely
sat back and waited until he knew jeopardy had attached and
then attempted to use the Double Jeopardy Clause as a sword • -not as a shield, but as a sword, deliberately deferred his
decision to file a motion on legal grounds until after jeopardy
had attached.

I think the Court was quite concerned about run­

ning into that situation, and certainly In the Lee case they
came very close to that situation.

Counsel in that case bad

deferred his motion until the very morning of trial, and a
motion chat would require research,and he very well knew that,
and that was noted by the trial judge In his opinion because
he said:

''Gentlemen, I am going to need time to consider this

motion,” and .they then proceeded with the proofs.
Now, that’s not the situation we have here.
QUESTION:

That’s a distinction all right, but there

is also another distinction and that is that in Lee prosecu­
torial error was present and here there is no prosecutorial
error.

Is that not correct?
M'l, MARIfCTTI:

Well, it depends how the Court decides

27

to look at what prosecutorial error is.

It would be my position

that the prosecutor made error by delaying in bringing the
indictments in this case when he had opportunity to do so.
QUESTION:

Well, certainly, he had no prosecutorial
«

error during the trial?
MR. MARIETTX:
QUESTION:

Certainly not.

Really, other than a verdict of acquittal,

any other motion is going to be based on some sort of prose­
cutorial error, as Justice Blackmun described it, isn't it,
prosecutorial misconduct, delay, improper search or seizures?
MR. MARIETTI;

I think that is true except for the

situation where, of course, the court itself makes sn error.
But, basically, of course, it is based on my opponent making
error in the case.

But I think the Lee decision also is

different for an important reason and the important reason is
that that prosecutorial error is capable of being corrected,
if, in fact, it is error.

And I don't think it was argued in

that case that the prosecutor did not make error.
that the prosecutor had made error.

It was clear

He filed defective

Informa tion or indic tment.
In a fantasy situation, I submit that readily lends
itself zo correction.
QUESTION:

But It is corrected at the sacrifice of

your client’s Interest in having his fate determined by the
first jury.

28
MR. MARIETTA;

Well, first of all, let me say I am

not necessarily saying 1 agree with the Lee decision.
QUESTION:

You don't have to agree with anything.

MR, MARIETTA:

But I am saying, Justice Rehnquist,

that I think we have a stronger case here for that reason,
because the Lee decision did involve an error by the prosecution
that could be corrected.

This is not the case here.

You see, in that case, it would be simple for the
prosecutor to simply file a new information, add the elements
of the offense, which I believe they left out knowledge, and go
back to trial.

And the trial judge in that case even indicated

to the prosecution that "If ycu had done this information
properly and drafted it properly there is no question that the
facts here fit the crime."
QUESTION:

Well, the Government's argument here is

that what it conceives as the error committed by the trial judge,
too, can be corrected if it can just argue it to the aixth
Circuit on the merits.
MR * MARIETTA:

With all respect, I think we are

confusing the error that I am talking about.

He’s talking about

the error made by the court in its decision on whether or not tc
grant a motion made during trial and whether or not to proceed
with that motion at trial.

That’s the error he's talking about.

Anci I an talking about the error that the prosecutor made in
the Lee case which was drafting the indictment improperly, and

29

the error that the prosecution made in this casei In the delay in
bringing the charges against my client.

And that delay can

never be corrected.
QUESTION:

Why should that be critical for purposes

of double jeopardy analysis?
MR0 MARIETTA:

I feel it should be critical because

,

the decision in L.ee, the decision in Dlnitz which the Govern­
ment in this case attempts to rely upon, seems to suggest that
we somehow had a choice., we somehow determined our fate in this
case, and we decided that because of the makeup of the jury,
because of the way the facts had fallen in the case, somehow
we opted to have this case dismissed by the trial judge»
QUESTION:

Well, you did, didn't you?

MRo MARIETTA:

I don't think it was that sort of

situation and here is why I think it is different.

I think

it is different because we didn't have a tainted jury in this
case like you may have had in the Einitz. decision.

We didn't

have a tainted jury where we were concerned with the jury
somehow getting to hear evidence that they should never have
heard -QUESTION:

But you preferred to have the trial judge

dismiss the indictment on pre-trial delay grounds than go to
the jury and have its verdict and make your motion on pre­
trial delay grounds afterwards if the jury returned a verdict
of conviction.

30

MR* MARIETTA:

X preferred to have the judge decide

ray motion for dismissal prior to jeopardy being attached*
That's when it occurred* because X filed a motion long in
advance of trial of this case* in accordance with the court
rule* in an effort to be diligent in properly presenting my
case to the court.

And the court denied that motion.

didn't just Bay* "We’ll take it under advisement."

They

The court

said* "’Ale deny that motion*" and the reason they denied that
motion is because they said* "I want to hear the evidence."
QUESTION:

Well* then* there is some reason for a

trial judge doing that* isn't there?
MR» MARXETTl:

There certa inly is.

I don't quarrel with that.

Certainly is.

But in terms of what the defendant

did in this case* in terms of choosing his own fate* X don't
think it can properly be said that we so opted that own fate*
in that regard* because we tried to present this case to the
judge prior to this jeopardy even attaching.
X have to agree with the comments of Justice Douglas
and Justice Brennan in the re-opinion* where they distinguish
the situation where counsel in good faith goes to that court
and says* prior to any trial cr any jeopardy attaching* "May
we please have a decision from this court,"

And if the court*

nevertheless* says* "No* your motion is denied*" then we have
no choice,

We have to be put in jeopardy.

And I don't think

it is fair to say that we selected our fate in that regard.

31
Unlike the man in Dinitz, the man in Dlnifcz who had
already prejudicial problems with that jury in terms of his
lawyer being disqualified and the jury being confronted with
the situation# we don't have that situation.

We don't have

a situation where if you brought in a new jury that it would
change our position in front of that jury.

No matter how many

jurors you bring into this case# our position and the facts
are still going to be the same.

And the pre-indictment delay

is still going to be the same no matter who the jury is.

And

that's why this case is decidedly different, I feel, from a
mistrial situation where there is prejudice or taint in that
trier of fact that occurs during the trial.

And that's why I

feel this case is completely different.
QUESTION:

Suppose you make before trial two motions,

one to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the statute
is unconstitutional that purports to authorize the indictment
for this client, and secondly, you had, in any event, the
statute doesn't reach the facts contained in the indictment,
that the statute just doesn't cover this charge.

And the

judge reserves both motions but during trial you renew — you
urge him to grant either one of them, and he grants one or the
other or both of them»

Would you be taking the same position

here then?
MR. MARIETTA;

As to the first motion, 3: would not.

The reason I would not be taking the same position is that that

32

question does not require the judge to hear- the facts of the
case or to make an appropriate decision,
QUESTION:

I know, but he does terminate the trial

and he doesn't think that you can ever be retried.
MR, MARIETTA

But the question in that case is:

Coes the judge have to know the facte of the case?
to me the question with that type of motion is:

It seems

Coes the

judge have to know the facts of the case in order to properly
decide the question of whether or not the statute is consti­
tutional?

I don't feel the judge has to have any facts before

him -QUESTION:

He thought he did.

That's why he waited.

He thought putting the statute in some kind of factual context
would help him make up his mind on the constitutional issue.
So he reserved and ultimately ruled,
MR. MARIETTl:
Court is referring to.
QUESTION:

I am not sure which decision the
There are a couple of decisions —

Very many.

I am just wondering whether

your position would be that there would be double jeopardy in
either one or both of those cases.
MR* MARIETTls

My position would be different, and it

is going to depend on whether or not the judge through his
finding at that trial decides that now he is going ~~
QUESTION:

No.

MR* MARIETTl:

You renew the motion.
If I renew the motion, at that point,

33
I think I would have to revert to my position in this case.
I attempted in every way* within the court rules and within
proper procedure* to bring my motion before trial and to have
a determination before I was placed in jeopardy.
QUESTION:

If* under a {State procedure* you could

make such motions during trial* and they never were made before
trial* but you make them during trial* what then?
MR. MARlJTTl:

Well* I can see a divergence of opinion

with regard to the Court on that issue,

I think the Court*

from what I’ve read
QUESTION:

And what's your opinion?

MR. MARIETTI:

In my opinion* in that situation* I

would still say that if I have been put to the test of the
triers of fact* that if a jury has been paneled and jeopardy
has been attached* and it is not a manifest necessity situation
or a mistrial situation* which it clearly is not* then I would
submit that jeopardy would attach.
QUESTION:

Even though you are the one who urged the

dismissal?
MR. MARIETT.I;

That's right.

But I emphasize to this

Court that that is not the situation that we have here.

I

don't think it is fair to judge me on those sort of facts
because I made that motion prior to trial and I made it
because that's when —
QUESTION;

In my examples* if the judge said to you*

34
"Well, I have just been reading Supreme Court opinions and I
am afraid I'd be in trouble if I granted these motions now,.
I am going to wait until a jury comes in with a verdict.

And

if the jury finds you innocent, the show is over anyway, but if
it finds you guilty then I'll rule on your motion."
Then, I suppose, the decision in your favor, postverdict, would be subject to appeal.
MR, MARIETT.I:
decision,

Certainly would, under the Wilson

I have no doubt about that.

If there has been a

determination by the jury that can be reinstated following an
appeal, then I would have to abide by the decision of this
Court in United States v, Wilson,
QUESTION: What happens if a case like this, after
the evidence is all in, the judge says, "I've held this motion
up,

I am now ready to decide it.

I am going to grant the

motion oecause from the witnesses to this case and their
demeanor on the stand It's obvious that time has interfered
with their memory."

That would be an entirely different case,

wouldn't it?
MR, MARIETTI:

I don't think it would be an entirely

different case for this reason, because I think the judge did
<1

make comments to that effect.

Judge Pox, in making his

decision on this motion, indicated not- only that my client,
Mr, Ecott, suffered from a problem with recall of events, he
also noted that the chief witness for the Government, the

35
informant. Mr. Jordan, also experienced difficulties recalling
the events.

The judge made that part of his decision,

QUESTION:

Well, I could give some respect to the

second point, but some of us have tried some criminal cases
and isn’t it perfectly common that the defendant, quote,
"disremembers"?

Isn't that norma1?

MR. MARIJ2TTI:

Well, I am sure I don’t have the

privilege that the Court has in that regard, but I certainly
have been faced with situations where the defendant does not
have a memory,
QUESTION:

As I understand, the Government says

that the fact that this went in and was carried over it
really goes back to the original motion and that nothing
transpired.
MR, MARIETTI:

I do not believe that that part of

the case is clear because the judge said in his pre-trial
order, "The motion is denied,"
QUESTION:

That’s the trouble, I think, you have.

You would have the burden.

If it is unclear, you might not

w in.
MR. MARI.ETTI:

Well, he indicated the motion was

denied, but he said in that that it was denied without
prejudice.
My point in raising that part of the whole sequence
of events is to point out to this Court that I am not the

36
counsel that you were faced with In Lee or that you were con­
cerned with in the &:1sson decision that might arise who waited,
waited until 1 was in jeopardy to use it as a sword.
QUESTION:

What if you have a motion for a directed

verdict on the issue of entrapment at the close of all the
evidence, something which could not possibly have come up before
jeopardy attached and the judge grants that motion?

Is that

appealable or not under the statute making appealability
dependent upon double jeopardy?
MR. MARIhTTX:

It would be my position on entrapment

I am not prepared to argue the law of entrapment, of
course -QUESTION:

No, right or wrong --

MR. MARIhTTI:

It would be my position that since

facts were heard which go to the guilt or innocence of the
defendant and he was put to the test, as indicated in Green
and the other decisions, that that certainly would bar appeal
of that.

That would be my position.

And that raises another

point
QUESTION:

Wven though there was no possibility of

ever obtaining a ruling on that issue prior to jeopardy
attaching, the way you say you tried to do but were prevented
from doing.
MRo MAMhTTI:

That's right.

I feel that way.

If

the Court is going to look at the real interests of the'double

Jeopardy Clause, as set forth in Green»
But again, I emphasize that is not the case here and
that is one of the under plnnings of my whole presentation to
this Court, that I didn {t sit back, I didn't sit back and use
this Double Jeopardy Clause as a sword'.

1 did everything that

responsible lawyering requires, in terms of bringing these
motions ahead of time so that I wouldn't be placed in jeopardy,
I wouldn't have to be placed in that situation.

And by the

time we got to trial, and we got all the way through the trial,
I was forced to forego asserting a legal right.
QUESTION:

Do you say that the court could have been

as fully advised in responding to your pre-trial motion, without
any evidence before him, as he was after he had the evidence
before him?
MR„ MARI^TTI:

Absolutely not.

And I think that the

Government and I are in agreement on this respect.

This is a

peculiar type of motion, a motion for pre-indictment delay,
because it does require evaluating the prejudice to the defen­
dant versus the intentional activities of the Government.

And

1 think it is necessary in that situation to hear some of the
fa c ts.

Iund erafca no tha t „
QUESTION:

Do you suppose it's possible that, among

other things, in postponing a ruling on the motion, the judge
took into account the fact that your client was a police officer
who was presumably trained to remember facts and, therefore,

38
this delay might be different with respect to him than for
some other person not a policeman?
MR. MAR1ETT1:

I know the judge took that into

account, Mr» Chief Justice.

I know that he took into account

this man was involved in a number of narcotics transactions,
a myriad of them in the course of his police duties, and that
there was a myriad of times and dates that he was required to
testify to as a police officer, let alone in defending himself.
I am quite .sure the judge was cognizant of that when he made
his ruling in this case.

I am quite sure of that, and 1 would

agree that -QUESTION:

Then why doesn't that bring you very close

to the situation that Mr» Justice Rehnquist has just postulated
to you?
MR. MARIETTI:

I don't see the parallel.

I am afraid

I don*"6 see it.
For my return, I also have to disagree vehemently
with the position that has been put forth here by the Government,
this morning, which X think Justice Stevens commented on, that
somehow this is not the Jenkins situation because we don't have,
quote,

’an acquittal," here.

I think we've come to the point

now where we don't get hung up on the terms, whether it is
labeled a dismissal, an acquittal, or whatever.

In my reading

of the opinion,in Jenkins, it is that the Court was unsure.
The Court was not clear as to whether or not there had been a

39
final resolution of the guilt of the defendant.

But it seems

to me that the Court was clear in the Jenkins decision that
there had been a final resolution in favor of the defendant in
that case3 regardless of whether or not it was truly an acquit­
tal for the failure of the prosecution to prove the element of
knowledge or not.

The Court said that they were unclear and

for that reason it was a situation similar to those situations
where you do have an acquittal, but the Court did not come out
and say Jenkins was an acquittal.

. r.c . :

And I am not here today before this Court arguing
that whet happened in this case was an acquittal.

But certainly

in this case, as was stated in the Jenkins decision, or rather
the Wiljon decision, by Justice Douglas in his dissent in the
Wilson decision, "Certainly in that case the court in arriving
at the conclusion that it die had to consider all the facts
in the case, facts which bore the elements of the offense,
as well as on the motion"»- in that case which was the same as
t

in this case — "for pre-indictment delay."
And you know there is an inescapable conclusion that
follows from the argument of the Government in this case, one
inescapable conclusion that the Court ~~ that this Court -- felt
was crucial in the decision they rendered in Jenkins,

And that

simply is that Mr. Scott, if this Court should say there is
jurisdiction to entertain this appeal in the Sixth Circuit,
and if that Sixth Circuit should say that Judge was in error —

40

which ws don't believe he was, but that's not before this Court
— Mr» . *cott is going to undergo yet another trial»

And that

is not the situation we have in Wilson, and it is the situation
we had in Jenkins.
QUESTION:

Mr» Mariettl, on the acquittal point, you

can't get an acquittal in your case, as I see it, because if
your original motion had been granted he would not have been
acquitted.

The indictment would have been dismissed, right?.
MR. MARIeTTX:
QUESTION:

That is true.

I agree with that.

So, I mean, by your being in trial, I

think, if you would win, you don't have to show an acquittal.
Couldn't you make that position?
MR* MARliTTI:

I take the position, Mr. Justice

Marshall, that once the judge denied our motion our motion was
over and we were placed in jeopardy at that point.
QUESTION:

But you renewed your motion.

Ml 1, MA RIxiTT I:
QUESTION:

Was it a motion to dismiss the indictment?

I-IRo MARIETTI:
QUESTION:

W e cer ta in 1 y 6 id .

It certainly was.

So the motion he granted was the motion

to dismiss?
MR» MARIETTX:

The motion that he granted, in all

fairness to the position of the Government in this case, was
the motion to dismiss the case for pre-indictment delay.
QUESTION:

If someone takes the position that

41

we are not going to bury It just on language alone* aren't you*
too, in agreement that they are both the same?

You don’t need

the word "acquittal."
MR, MARIETTl:

I agree completely with that position.

I think the whole Court* from what I read in the decisions,
agrees with that position* that we are not going to let these
matters hinge on terminology.

But I do see the situation

arising here that, you had in Jenkins.

This man is going to

have to face trial again* go all the way through the trial.
We didn’t have a situation here where we had a short bench
trial or where we had a trial that was terminated part way
through the prosecution’s case.

Mr. Scott went through the

entire trial,
QUESTION:

Well* .See was going to have to face trial

again* too»
MR, MARTLTTI:

1 understand that* but in Lee* 1

think* in that case* the Court took note that it was clear that
the judge did not contemplate that this man could never be
convicted of this offense.

Because the judge said, in Lee —

in his decision* he said* "Look* the evidence of guilt is
here* but their information is drafted improperly."

And I

think the Court in JDinitz also said the same thing because they
gave the defendant an opportunity to retain further counsel
in the case if he granted a mistrial.
there is going to be another trial.

That contemplates that
And I thought what the

Court said in Lee was that if the decision rendered by the
lower court was to the effect that this man can never be
prosecuted for this offense, that he simply can't be convicted,
in fact, in this case, if there was pre-indictment delay, then
he never can be convicted of that offense.

And I submit that's

what this Court said and that's why this case is like the
language in Lee, but different from the facts of Lee,because
there is nothing that can correct pre-indictment delay.

There

is something that can correct an improperly drafted information.
But it aan never be corrected in this case and, therefore, the
judge when he ruled «•- and he knew that when he ruled — was
making a ruling based on an assumption that this man could
never be convicted of this offense, and that's exactly what
Bee seems to distinguish.

It says if that's the situation we

have then clearly we have a situation where the Double Jeopardy
Clause will act as a shield, not as a sword but as a shield.
I see my time is approaching an end and I would just
like to comment finally on the alternative- that the Government
proposes in this case.

And that alternative seems to be that

what we should do -- what a trial lawyer should do -- is more or
less sandbag the Government and wait until the case is over with
and then pop all your motions, bring them out of the bag and
have the judge decide them, at that point in the case.
QUESTION:

There would be nc sandbagging in the case

of waiting on a motion for pre-trial delay, would there?

Since

there would be nothing that could be done during the trial but
correct the Government's pre-trial delay, as you commented.
MR. MAEIhTTJ:

I would think that, the Government

should have some prior notice of,..the. defendant having to
present this motion or is going to present it at the conclusion
of the case, because they certainly want to bring these factors
out in the testimony of their witnesses.
I urge the Court not to fashion a new rule of
procedure for proceeding in these cases.

The Government

indicated we can call it an arrest of judgment.

I felt that

in Justice Harlan’s decision In Sisson that he clearly indicated
that if you are going to get involved in deciding something
that requires a decision on the facts, that goes beyond the
face of the indictment, that that is clearly not an arrest
of judgment.

And so I can't buy. the Government's arguement

in this case that we could make a motion for arrest of judgment
because that decision that the judge would make at the con­
clusion of that case would necessarily be based upon the facts.
And I submit to the Court, in conclusion, that if
this Court fashions this new form of procedure for proceeding
in trial courts on pre-trial motions and motions of trial,
4

that you are going to create chaos.

You are going to have

judges who are put in the position that the judge was in the
Lee cast?, with somebody running in on the day of trial and
saying, "Here's my motion.

Decide it new."

And the judge can't

44
possibly do it, and the judge shouldn't be put in that position.
And 1 just want to conclude by saying, Gentlemen,
we have not come here to use the Double Jeopardy Clause as a
sword.

I think that was intended as a shield by the Constitu­

tion and we have done everything we can to be certain that it
would be used in that fashion.

Thank you.

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further, Mr, Frey?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, EDQ .,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, FREY:

Just a couple of things, Mr. Chief Justice.

Respondent misconstrues our argument on the timing
of the notion.

Of course, the motion should be made in the

first instance in advance of trial.

But, as we argued in

Lovasco, this kind of motion is best determined only after
trial.

Our objection is to its determination in the middle of

trial, when our appeal rights are defeated — contrary, by the
way, to the policies of Rule 12(e) of the Rules of Criminal
Procedure.

In other words, the motion should be made before

trial.
Now, Respondent wants you, of course, to look at
this case from the perspective of where we stand now.
is going to have to be subjected to a second trial.

He
But if

you decide this case in the Government's favor, look at it
from the proper perspective, which is at the time, at the point

45
in trial, when the Respondent could have a ruling on his motion.
And the judge says, "I am ready to rule on your motion now."
Now, Respondent has a choice in that situation.

He can accept

the ruling then and there, terminating the trial if it is in
his favor.

He simply does so at the risk that if he introduced

error into the trial the Government can get it corrected and
there will be a second trial.
Alternatively, he can say, without any prejudice
QUESTION:

How can you correct the delay?

How can

the Government correct the delay?
MR. FREY:

That's a very important point.

He says there was prosecutorial error in the delay.
If he is right, there will be no second trial because the
Court or Appeals will affirm the dismissal.

It is only if

there was no prosecutorial error and no impermissible delay,
and, therefore, no error that needs to be cured, except one
that -QUESTION:

But do yen agree that- there is no, way to

correct a prosecutorial delay if there is, in fact, a prose­
cutorial delay?
MR, FREY:
is exactly my point.

I agree wholeheartedly with that and that
If there is, in fact, an improper prose­

cutorial delay in this case, there will be io second trial.
QUESTION:

Your point, I take it', is that the

Government is entitled to have the Court of Appeals decide

46
whether a delay of four and one-half months -- that's what
it was here in these circumstances -- is a delay warranting
dismissa1.
MR, PREY:

Yes.

I think that Respondent was entitled

to have that issue decided in connection with his trial»

But

what I am suggesting to the Court is the decision should have
been after verdict if he wanted to avoid the risk of two trials.
That would have been no cost
QUESTION:

I think you are saying now what you started

to say A/hen you were interrupted.

Alternative -- A defendant

makes a motion, based upon unconstitutional pre-trial delay,
to dismiss the indictment.

You say now the judge says, !II grant

your motion and I aim about to dismiss the indictment."
say the defendant shouldn’t do that.
Your Honor, don’t grant my motion.

And you

He should say, "No, no,
Let the trial go on."

Can you Imagine any defense counsel in the world who would do
that?
MR» PREY:

Absolutely.

If this Court reverses in

Scott, it will be clear to defense counsel that he has a choice.
He can have a raid-trial ruling if the judge is willing to give
him one, pre-verdict ruling, and not ever get the jury's deter­
mination of guilt or innocence.
QUESTION:
grant my motion.

But he is supposed to say, "No, don't

I want to gc on and my client may be found

guilty, but don’t grant my motion to dismiss even though you

47

-

want to,"
MR, FREY:
granted anyway.

No, not to?11 grant it.

He'll get it

It’s a question of when it's granted.

It's

a question of whether it's granted before verdict or after
verdict.

He should say, "Your Honor, I want to see if the

jury will acquit me."
Now you may think that that's unrealistic ~~
QUESTION:

It takes a good deal of self-restraint on

the par’s of defense counsel.
MR, FREY:

If defense counsel appreciates the possible

costs in terms of a second trial — Remember Rule 12(e) says
that these kinds of motions are not to be deferred for disposi­
tion during trial, if that would compromise the appeal rights
of the Government,, which if we lose here it certainly would.
So this kind of motion shouldn't be

In fact, there is some

question whether the judge has power to rule upon it during the
trial.
QUESTION:

Mr, Frey, if the Government's submission

is accepted and,putting aside mistrial situations which are a
little bit special, does the time at.which jeopardy attaches
have any further Significance?
MR, FREY:

You know we have a case —

Yes, it has a great deal of significance

under Serfass, that is, you could have an acquittal that occurs
prior to trial, which is really what you had in Serfass.
QUESTION:

But the time of attaching jeopardy doesn't

48
make any difference any more, I don’t think.
MR, FREY:
of situations.

Well, it makes a difference with two kind©

The first situation is if you have an acquittal

that is reviewable if it is prior to the attachment of jeopardy.
That’s what Serf ass held.

So the time of attachment of jeopardy

may be significant in relation to the time a judge makes the
ruling that "I've looked at tie files and it is plain to me
that the defendant has committed no offense. "
The second respect in which it is significant is
if you have a manifest necessity case, like the issue in
Crist vKline that got abandoned by the State.

You may have

had an unjustifiable mistrial declared by the court.

And if

that was done before the attachment of jeopasody there is no
double jeopardy bar to a retrial then,
QUESTION:

That's all a mistrial situation, isn't it?

MR. FREY:

W el 1, but tha t' a —

QUESTION:

Except for Serfass the only time it makes

any difference is when the question is whether there was
manifest necessity for mistrial.

If there is a defense, for

example, of statute of limitations or entrapment, as Justice
Rehnquist

or any other defense, it could always be reviewed.

It wouldn't matter if the man was in jeopardy or not.
MR, FREY:

I have to say -«

QUESTION:

It wouldn’t make it wrong, necessarily,

MR„ FREY:

— if the defense was entrapment, if the

49
defense was what Mr» Justice White suggested, that the statute
is unconstitutional, you get into very difficult questions as
to whether what you have is really an acquittal, either whatyou have is really the kind of determination that the defendant
is not guilty of a crime,which is insulated from review because
of the special vested interest —
QUESTION:

Ail I am saying is that on all those

issues it doesn't matter what the time of placing a man in
jeopardy -- It doesn't make any difference any more, I don't
think»

I may be wrong,
MR. FREY:

Yes, it makes a difference because if the

ruling is prior to the attachment of jeopardy then there is
not even inquiry into double jeopardy.

If feme ruling is after

the attachment of jeopardy, you have to ask yourself: in an
entrapment case, it is arguable whether or not that is the
kind of acquittal or dismissal going to the merits which ought
to be vested with the kind of protection that the Court has
given in Finch, given in Martin Linen, to those kinds of rulings.
And given in Jenkins.
If what you have is, as here, a claim that, well,
the defendant may be guilty, but there was discriminatory
prosecution.

The defendant may be guilty, but there was a

violation of his right to a speedy trial.

The defendant may

be guilty, but there was prejudicial pre-indictment delay.
Then you have a class of claims which, as I've argued and we've

50

argued in our brief., are not materially distinguishable in
policy terms from the prosecutor drew up an improper indictment,
the prosecutor introduced prejudicial and inadmissible material
before the jury
QUESTION:

What if you need to know when a fact

occurred to decide whether statute of limitations had run?
That would be just like pre-indictment delay, I suppose.
The Government could appeal it.
MR. FREY:

We would take that position.

I take it that

my opponent is harking back to the Elsson test which was a
statutory test which this Court in Wilson essentially abandoned
for defining what an acquittal was.

I don't think an acquittal

has to do with when the evidence is heard, but what it goes to
and whan the basis of the judge’s ruling.
QUESTION:

Mr. Frey, I still don’t understand your

position with respect to Jenkins.
acquittal there.

You say there was an

Well, the Court of Appeals may have said

there was, but this Court didn’t.

This Court didn't rest its

view on the fact that there was an acquittal.
tell,

Said it couldn’t

I would suppose that even if the Court had said there

was not an acquittal it would nave come out the same way,
MB, FREY:

That’s because what the Court couldn’t

tell was. something a little different here.

What the Court

knew in -Jenkins v;as that the District Court had said Ay la rc ■ -was
non-retinactive and the defendant could not be committed of

51

wilfully refusing to submit to induction because of the non*- .
retroactivity of Ay lard ,

The Government appealed., claiming that

that was legally erroneous and that we said every fact necessary
to support a conviction was found.
How, this Court said, in effect, "Let's suppose that
the District Court hadn't

Let's suppose the Government was
I

right that if the District Court had simply rested on Ay la rd
we could review that and reverse it," Let's suppose that,
although subsequently, I think, it was held that that’s not
so.

Then it said, "We still can't tell whether the defendant

found the facts' — whether the judge,"’ -r-. excuse me -- "found all
the facts that were necessary to support a conviction."

We

are not sure whether he found that there was a knowing refusal
to submit to induction.
QUESTION:

And whether or not he did, the Court said

further proceedings were necessary.
MU * FREY:

Yes, but -- The fact that in Jenkins

the Court may have said whether or not this was an acquittal,
the fact that further proceedings are;necessary bars an appeal,
doesn't answer the question about Lee.

Because in Lee and in

the mistrial cases it is also true that you don't have an
acquittal.

You still have to make the inquiry into whether an

appeal on a second trial is justified.
How, I am suggesting that we have in this case a
category of ruling which, when you look at the policies and

52
what we are trying to protect,, is more like Lee than it is like
Jenkins.

And the reason that that's so is because in Jenkins

It's plain that the court found the defendant hadn't committed
a crime, the District Court,

And the Supreme Court was saying,

"Well, suppose he found out on a legally erroneous basis,
suppose we could agree with the Government," and so on.

But

there was a finding that there was no crime,
Now, here, there was no finding that there was no
crime.

And we submit that that is and should be properly

critical to the double Jeopardy inquiry.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:IS o'clock, a.m., the case In the
above-entitled matter was submitted,)
