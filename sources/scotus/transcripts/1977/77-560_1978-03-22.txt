MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

W© will hear arguments

next, in Gardner against Westinghouse.
Mr. H&ckett, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT N. HACKETT, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HACKETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The argument of the petitioner, Jo Ann Evans Gardner,
will be presented first with a little statement of facts, than
I would like to discuss the legal issue of the heart, of the
relief sought in the case, than I would like to discuss the
unconditional denial of the class, then I would like to discuss
the rationale that the courts have used in interpreting
Section 1292 (a.) (1) as a means of appealing a denial of
injunction.
Then I would like to look at the logic of the cases
under 1292(a)(1), starting with the early cases in the Thirties,
and finally finished with Switzerland Cheese case in 1966.
Then I would like to discuss the issue of a permanent
versus a preliminary injunction, and then I woiild like to
discuss the strong policy to allow civil rights class actions,
and finally the general floodgate argument that has bean proposed by the respondent concerning the floodgate of appeals.
Jo Ann Evans Gardner filed this case on May 29, 1975,

4
seeking a wide class action under Rule 23(b)(2), seeking, as
the heart of the relief, injunctive relief.
The scope of the class is set forth in pages 8a to
11a of the Appendix, and the injunctive relief is set forth
in the complaint that it was requested in pages 13a to 14a.
We moved within 90 days as required by the local rule
for a class determinati.on. We filed the class interrogatories.
On February 3, 1976, the lower court denied the class action,
stating that Ms. Gardner was an inadequate representative of
tha class under 2 3(a) (4) , because she sought a job that soma
other woman night want, and therefore she

was antagonistic

to the class.
This was an unconditional order.
Then we appealed that decision as a matter of right
under 1292(a)(1) as a denial of our injunctive relief, because
it narrowed tha scope of the relief.

And the Third Circuit

dismissed with no jurisdiction, saying that 1292(a) (1) did not
apply.
First, I think it is obvious that the injunctive
relief under (b) (2) is -the heart of relief sought in a wide
civil rights case.

W© sought an across-the-board class

action, as has been sanctioned by 'the Fifth Circuit in Long vs.
Sapp, and the denial of the broad injunctive relief has been
recognised by four Circuits, the first Circuit doing so was
the Fourth in about 1962, under Brunson vs. Board of Trustees

5
The First;, Fifth and Ninth Circuits have ail agreed with that
under Yaffee vsc Powers, Jonas vs. Diamond, and Price vs»
Lucky Stores,
Further, the determination by Judge McCune that it
was an unconditional denial was a matter of law and he gained
no possibility except within his scop® of being raversed,
because if she’s antagonistic to the class, she's going to
stay antagonistic to the class.
Thus, as Justice Stewart said in Uni tad_Airlines vs,
McDonald, the action, was stripped of its character as a class
action.
QUESTION:

Didn’t the possibility remain open to you

of persuading Judge McCune to change his mind?
MR. HACKETT;

I don’t believe we could persuade

Judge McCune to change his mind. We could have tried, but we
felt, first of all, that we had a right of appeal because of
the four Circuit cases, and only, at that time, on© or two
against us? and secondly, it’s been our experience in the
Western District court that it is simply too unsure and heavy
a burden to try and get class action denials changed.
guess that

And I

was & policy decision on my part.
The unconditional denial doctrine was recognized in

Yaffas vs.Powers when they said the broad injunctive relief
was denied.
And I'd like to move to the general rationale of

6

what: the courts have used to interpret 1292 (a) (1) .
The words that th© courts have used since General
Electric vs» Marvel Rare Products to Switzerland Cheese has
not changed.

That is, if the substantial affect of the order

is to deny an injunction, then they have considered that
rationale as what they will look at,
QUESTION:

What if I — what if a friend of mine and

I sue for an injunction and two other friends move to intervene
and they’re denied?
MR. HACKETT:
QUESTION:

Under —
Are they -- is that denial appealable?

I

MR, HACKETT:
QUESTION:

Is that permissive intervention, sir?

Yes. And is it appealable?

MR, HACKETT:

Under permissive intervention, I don’t

believe it’s appealable.
Under —
QUESTION: Even though, arguably, that certainly
denies them an injunction, right?
MR, HACKETT: Arguably it does, but they are free
right there to institute their own suit, and they know about
it, and there is no problem then instituting the suit.
I think that's a little different fact situation.
I think the class action situation is more like General Electric
vs. Marvel Rare Products, where a counterclaim asks for an
injunction, and the counterclaim was denied, and they held it

7
was a denial of an Injunction.
The courts all the way through General Electric to
Switzerland Che-ase have said that the substantial effect
doctrine will apply.
Now, let's look at what the results were of the
#

1291 cases.

I submit that if you , follow the logic of looking,

if the decision affects the ultimate relief sought, then it
should be appealable under 1292(a)(1).
Now, for example, if you're just delaying the decision
in Switzerland Cheese, where you fail to grant a summary
judgment, and then you leave the equitable relief possibility
open to the end because there's an issue of fact, you are
not affecting the ultimate relief that you could get.

You're

only delaying it.
Again, in Baltimore Contractors, if you're simply
saying, refusing to stay an accounting, an accounting does not
give you the ultimate relief.

An accounting is only a means

used to show if something is owed or not.

But in a class

action, you are drastically reducing the scop© of the relief
sought.
As Justice Stevens said in his dissent in Sprogis,
you must have a class action in order to get the wide injunctive
relief, or it would be unfair to the defendant.
And this Court, Justice Stewart, in the Teamsters vs0
U.S. case, and Justice Brennan in Franks vs. Bowman, set forth

8

the burden of proof in class action cases, and the injunction
granted in a class action sets th© perimeters for that burden
of proof.

So that you have a completely different burden of

proof in class action cases and in th© scop© of the relief
than you do in a McDonald Douglas vs, Green case, which was tee
individual opinion by Justice Powell,
QUESTION: But if I joined two or three claims in a
suit against a defendant and the judge terminates my case with
respect to two of my claims and has permanently reduced the
kind of a judgment that I can get, I still can't appeal unless
he cooperates with me,
MR, HACKETT:

If you joined the suits, and you have

claims where ■—
QUESTIONs

I have claims and everybody agrees that if

I prevailed on all three claims I'd have a million dollars, if
I prevail on on® instead of three I’ll hav© $100,000,
MR, HACKETT: But I don't believe that's injunctive
relief sought, is it, sir?
QUESTION: Well, it may not be, but it certainly
affects the scope of my judgment.
MR. HACKETT:

Oh, yes, sir, but it isn't the scopa

of th© judgment -that's at issue.

Mr. Justice White, it's the

scop® of the injunctive relief, that 1292(a)(1) speaks to.
It has -to ba a denial of a relief that is equitable in nature
and injunctive in natur©, and not just a change in —

9

QUESTION: So you

saying that; you would have the

same -- you would be ma-ing the same argument if I joined
three claims for am injunction, and if I won on all of them
that would ba an injunction of a certain scope, and if I only
win on one it would be a much narrower injunction.

You say

that it doesn’t
MR. HACKETT:
QUESTION:

It wouldn't have to

dismisses two of my claims?
MR0 HACKETT:
asking for

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. HACKETT:

~* and the claim as to the injunctions

is dismissed* on© or two of them, I think that's exactly the
General Electric-Marvel case, where the counterclaim came in,
he dismissed the counterclaim, the counterclaim asked for an
injunction, held appealable.
QUESTION:

Under 1291?

MR. HACKETT:
QUESTION:

I think that's that fact, sir,

Under 1292, sir,

Yes,

Well, that requires the judge to

MR. HACKETT:

10

QUESTION"

No, under that one, that's right.

QUESTION:

Well, would you say Rule 54 is not

involved at all in that 1292(a) appeal?
MR» HACKETT:
Rslmquist.

No.

That's correct, Justice

We have it as a matter of right.

In other words,

it's an exception to the rule.
I think it's also clear that 1292(a) applies to a
permanent as well as a preliminary injunction.

There is no

question that there is precedent for this in this Court's
cases, in George vs. Victor Talking Machine in 1934, and
John Simmons case in 1922, and I think Mr. Justice Rehnquist,
in his opinion in Wetzel indicated that an appeal would have
bean possible under 1292(a)(1) by the granting of an injunction,
but we had the parties mixed up in Wetzel.

So that we couldn't

get it.
But he indicated in that case that it would be
possible on a permanent injunction, not just a preliminary
injunction.

Judge Friendly in -the Second Circuit, in Stewart-

Warner vs. Westinghouse, in his dissent, indicated that only
-- 1292(a)(1) only applies to a preliminary injunction.
other Circuits have accepted that.

No

There are many Circuit

cases and Supreme Court cases that don't accept that.

And he

cited Justice Frankfurter's argument in 1928, Business of the
Court, and other legislative history.
Now, I think it's very close --

11

QUESTIONs

But it was true that, the old three-judge

court, you couldn't get a three-judge court unless you asked
for a preliminary injunction.
MR. HACKETT:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION% This is no longer true, so I guess maybe
that might bo the reason for that.
MR. HACKETT s

I think that's true.

That was — I

believe you discussed that in Goldstein vs. Cox said in the
Tidewater case, Mr. Justice Marshall.
QUESTION:

It could be what the -— but that's not

true any more.
MR. HACKETT:

But it's a good thing to point that

out, I think, sir, that the expediting act says particularly
"preliminary injunction”.

1292(a)(1) doesn't say preliminary

injunction.
QUESTION:

What if you have six defendants and

you're having a hearing on a preliminary injunction before a
district judge, and he grants a motion to dismiss as to one of
the six defendants; is that appealable under 1292(a)?
MR. HACKETT:

If •— are the defendants requesting,

in a counterclaim, injunctive relief?
QUESTION:

No.

QUESTION:

No.

MR. HACKETT:

And you're requesting — yes, that has

been held appealable in some Circuit cases, where they said

12
that the dismissal of three or four defendants, where .you
narrowed the scope of the injunctive relief, that would be
appealable under 1292 (a).
QUESTION:

And you say that goes for just dismissal

of one out of ten defendants, too?
MR. HACKETT;

I'm not sura of the exact number,

but
QUESTION:

Well, how can it possibly make any

difference as to the exact number?
MR. HACKETT:
QUESTION:

I don't think it does, conceptually.

I don't think it does, either.

MR. HACKETT:

Unless it was just deminimal.

In

other words, you have to say, and we have to us© -the test, is
the substantial effect is to limit the injunctive relief
sought.
QUESTION: Where do you get the word "substantial"
in that?
MR. HACKETT: The substantial effect comes from all
•the previous cases, -the E ne 1 ow- Edison cases, the General Electri<
case, it's cited in Baltimore Contractors --QUESTION:

Do you have the cases cited that you were

referring to in response to Hr. Justi.ce Rehnquist's question?
MR. HACKETT:
QUESTION:
MR. HACKETT:

The particular —About dismissing particular defendants?
That, is a Circuit case, sir, Build of

Well, that's not from this Court, than?

MR, IIACKETT:

Not from

that particular case is

But the substantial effect language is

QUESTION:

Is that cited in your brief?

MR. IIACKETT:
QUESTION:

Build of Buffalo?

Yes, it is, sir.

Mr. Ilackett, I believe you referred to a

MR. IIACKETT:

brief.
MR. IIACKETT:

I believe we cited Stswart-Warner.

QUESTION: Well, don't trouble yourself now.

I can't

find it in the list, but we will locato it.
MR. IIACKETT:

The next subject 'that I would like to

move to is the strong policy that this Court has
QUESTION:
one more question.

Before you move to that, let me ask you
Supposing, again in a hypothetical case,

you have six defendants, hearing on a preliminary injunction,
the district court grants a preliminary injunction as to five
of the defendants, says he reserves ruling as to the sixth
defendant, will not issue a preliminary injunction, doesn't
dismiss him, and puts the whale matter over for hearing on final
injuncti, on.

Appealable?

14
MR, RACKET?:

There is authority that, a delay or

continuance in the granting of a preliminary injunction is
appealable.

I don't believe it’s from this Court.

QUESTION:
MR. HACKETT;

An authority from this Court?
No, sir.

It's not from this Court.

I'd like the Court to look at the strong public
policy -that was announced in this Court in the Albemarle case
by Mr. Justice Stewart* citing the 1972 amendments to Title
VII, and saying that those amendments were not to do anything
which would discourage private class action.
It's important to realize that the class action tool
is the catalyst tool to enforce Title VII by plaintiffs, and
tills Court, in looking at the class action, in almost all of
their decisions, in Franks vs. Bowman, Albemarle, and in Team”
stars vs. U.S. , has recognized that strong public policy not to
deteriorate the use of the class action device. And I think
one of the reasons it shouldn't deteriorate the us© of the
class action devic© is that one of the vary purposes of Rule
23

was to prevent the multiplicity of suits.

That is, that

if you're suing a corporation and you're asking for broad
injunctive relief on a wide basis, there is then no need to
have individual suits.
And this particular use of the device is exactly what
is meant he be used in Titia VII, and the decisions of this
Court in Title VII have really focused on stating the vast

15
difference in the burden of proof, and the vast differences
in the presumptions that are available to class plaintiffs
when a decision has been made on a stage one or liability
proceeding of class actions in Title VII.
Nov/, -the answer — the first ten pages of the
respondent's argument and the questions that came from this
Court in the previous argument focused a good deal on the
floodgate problem:

will we have a floodgate of appeals if

we allow this?
I think it's very interesting to look at the annual
reports of the Director of the Administrative Office of the
United States Courts.

We have done that.

V1& have taken the

average percentage of appeals, excluding bankruptcy, which are
civil rights appeals.

Now, for the years 1965 to 1977 only

6.17 percent of the appeals were civil rights appeals.

That's

the average of all Circuits.
QUESTION:

You mean under the statute, under —

MR. HACKETT:

Not under just Title VII, but it

also includes 1983 and other statutes that are civil rights
)
related.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. HACKETT:
QUESTION:

I'm not sure of just every statute —
But that's broader than just under the

1964 Act as amended?
MR. HACKETT:

Plus, also plus the —

16
QUESTION:

It's broader, I say — or you say?

MR. HACKETT:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Unh-hunh.

MR. HACKETT:

For example — and then it’s interesting

to note, isn’t it logical — isn’t it logical if we’re going to
have a floodgate of appeals that if we went to the Fourth
Circuit, and we went to Brunson vs. _ Doa.ro o f T r us tees , which
we decided in 1962, that since that time, in the Fourth Cd.rcu.it,
tiie appeals would have greatly increased percentagewise,
compared to Circuits that didn’t have this doctrine.
That's not true.

If we look at the Fourth Circuit

from 1966 t;o 1977,

we see that they had an average increase

of 21.14 percent.

But in the n„ C, Circuit which never had

the doctrine and still doesn't have it, because Williams vs^
Mumford denied the doctrine in '75, they had an increase of
42.89 percent.
QUESTION:

Is that all appeals or class action --

MR. HACKETT:

That's all appeals, sir. Right.

QUESTION: Well, —
MR. HACKETT:

Well, obviously, though, if this

opened the floodgate there "would be some increase in narcen tag®,
because you couldn't factor 'that percentage increase out, Mr.
Justice Stevens, I don't believe.
So it's important to realise that, we're only talking
about 6 percent, roughly 6 parcent of all appeals in the

17
civil rights area, and that there's no indication that "the
decisions of the Ninth Circuit:, the Fifth Circuit, the Fourth
Circuit and the First Circuit have increased the appeals
percentagewise, when they switched to this doctrine.
Son© of then go down.
Therefore, I -think the floodgate of appeals argument
is not only factually wrong, but also I believe that Mr. Justice
Burger in U. S. vs. Abney indicated that under 1291 and under
the whole Court's philosophy in looking at appeals, that
whether you have to do, in essence, more work doesn't make a
legal reason not to have an appeal if, as a matter of right,
you have it: under 1292 (a) (1) , or under any statute.
The philosophy has always been we give the practical
and non-technical approach.

And I do not think it is a legal

argument to argue that an increase in load is a legal reason
for refusing the appeal.
And in closing, of course, I'd like to say that, in
any ©vent, the floodgate statistics presented in the respondent's
brief are not well-founded, and I believe an analysis of tee
Administrative Courts will show teat they are not correct.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs
Mr. s cheinholtz.

Very well, Mr. Hackett.

18

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD L. SCIIEINJOLTZ, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF TIIE RESPONDENT
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Courts
This case presents the narrow questi.on as to whether
the denial of class certification in a lawsuit seeking permanent
but not preliminary injunctive relief is immediately appealable
as of right under 28 U. S. Code 1292(a)(1) as an interlocutory
order refusing an injunction.
It is undisputed that Congress, in adopting 1292,
intended a very limited exception to the final judgment rule
embodied in 1291, which, since the First Judiciary Act has
been the dominant rule of appellata practice.

Congress has

determined that with respect to certain categories, specific
categories of interlocutory orders, set‘forth in subsection (a),
an immediate appeal should be allowed as a right.
And it’s also provided, for discretionary appellate
review of other interlocutory orders, under 1292(b), provided
the conditions set forth in that subsection are mat.
This Court has recognized, in a number of decisions,
that appeal rights cannot depend upon the facts of a particular
case.

Congress has necessarily had to draw the jurisdictional

statutes in terms of categories.

Thus the issue in any given

case, including this on®, is whether the particular order
appealed from fits within the category of appeals allowed by

19

Congress,

Or whether the appeal is not. permissible in -the

light of the principles and the history concerning appellate
jurisdiction and, in particular, the long-standing congressional
policy against piecemeal appeals.
Section 1292 does not expressly provide a right of
appeal with respect to orders, either granting or denying class
action status.

Notwithstanding that fact, Mrs. Gardner sought

to appeal the district court’s denial of certification and
argues that her appeal comes within the narrow exception to
the final judgment rule set forth in 1292(a) (1) , which permits
an appeal from an interlocutory order granting or refusing an
injunction.
Now, in that connection, it is significant that no
application for a preliminary injunction was ever made, and
preliminary injuncti.v© relief was not even requested in the
complaint.
While tiie complaint does contain a prayer for perman­
ent injunctive relief, the district court, in refusing to
permit this case to proceed as a class action, did not state
•that tli© claim for permanent injunctive relief had no merit,
nor that it lacked jurisdiction to grant that injunction, nor
did it even express any opinion as to whether injunctive relief
might be

warranted at any particular point in ‘the proceedings.
QUESTION:

Well, if they had to ask for a preliminary

injunction, you'd be making the same argument, wouldn't you?

20

MR» SCHEINIlOLTZ:

We would haw. mads the same argummuas ,

certain, ly,
QUESTION:

Well, you led me

astray there for a

minute.
MR*SCHEINIlOLTZ:

Yes.

We would have made precisely

the same argument, and our position is the same.
As Mr. Hackett indicated, Judge Marshall, there'is a
question as to whether 1292(a)(1) applies to the denial of
grant in permanent injunctions as well as preliminary injunctions.
I think that it#s clear that what Congress really intended to
reach here were denials of preliminary injunction.
And in Switzerland Cheese, when this Court had that
issue before it, it expressly decided that it would not decide
whether 1292(a)(1) did or did not apply to permanent as well
as preliminary injunctions*
However, I think our position, for the reasons that
I will state, would b© the same regardless of whether this
Court decides that 1292(a)(1) applies to permanent as well
as preliminary injunctions,
QUESTION: Well, what would you say if the complaint
does ask for a preliminary injunction and for class certifica­
tion, then if the- judge just denies the class certification
you would still be making the same argument here?
MR. SCHEINIlOLTZ:
QUESTION:

Sure

Oh, absolutely.

21
MR, SCTIEINHOLTZ :

Cert airily.

The district, court in this case, however, mad© no
order with respect to the merits of the suit.

The district

court simply decided that Mrs, Gardner had failed to satisfy
the requirements of Rule 23(a)(2),

(3)

and (4), and concluded

til at for that reason she was an inadequate class representative,
and that the case could not

proceed as a class action.

This

class determination order was wholly procedural, and did not
in any way determine the merits of the controversy,
QUESTION: Well, did Judge McCune's order rule out
the possibility of Mrs, Gardner ultimately obtaining on h©r
own an injunction?
MR, SCHEINHOLTZ:
Rehnquist.

Not at all.

Not at. all, Justice

Not only did it not rule that out, but it is

entirely possible that if sha proved th© kind of case that
she alleged in her complaint, that the relief that she might
get in her individual case might redound to the benefit of th©
punitive cliente.
In other words, th© fact that this case would proceed
only as an individual action, in and of itself, would not
determine the total scope of possible injunctive relief.

That

would not be known and could not b© known until a final hearing
on th© merits,
QUESTION:

What about four plaintiffs, all of them

ask for preliminary relief, th© judge grants preliminary relief

22
for two and refuses it, for two.

And the two went to appeal.

Now, -that's under 1292, I suppos©?
MR. SCIIEINIIOLTZ:

I don't believe that they would

have the right to appeal i.t under 1292(a) (1) , Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Because?

MR. SCIIEINIIOLTZ:

Because I think that that is not a

~™ with respect to the Act — well, I'm sorry, you're saying
if these cases are heard on the merits and they are —QUESTION:

No. They just — he just grants a

preliminary injunction for two of Idle plaintiffs, and denies
it for the others.
MR. SCIIEINIIOLTZ:

Denies for the other two.

I think

that that would be appealable, yes.
QUESTION:

By the other two.

MR* SCIIEINIIOLTZ:

By the other two, yes.

I had misunderstood your question.
I think that, however, here of course that didn't
happen.
QUESTION:

And I suppose if the — I suppose if, on

the preliminary injunction hearing, the judge, with respect to
too of the parties, says, "Well, you just don’t have any claim
anyway, so I'm dismissing your claim".
MR. SCIIEINIIOLTZ;

That would b© Idle same.

But the

difference between that cas© and this case is that there the
action of the court has an. immediate impact.

The injunction

23

is denied.

Ik is expressly denied.
In this case, that has not happened, and may not;

happen..

That is the difference.
QUESTION:

But you are determining that there are a

lot of unnamed plaintiffs who cannot have an injunction.
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:

Mo, sir, Your Honor, we’re not

determining that.
QUESTION:

Well, under your — there's a lot of

unnamed plaintiffs that can't have any relief at all.
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:

No.

All we're saying is that this

ca3e cannot proceed as a class action.

Those people would have

the right of intervention, they would have ~~ they could come in
as interveners.
QUESTION; Right.
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:

The only thing that the court

decided is the procedural question that this case could not
proceed as a class action.

It made no determination with

respect to the merits of the case, with respect to the unnamed
members of the class.
Not only that, but as Justi.ce Rahnquist recognised,
that decision, that this case could not proceed as a class
action, is subject to subsequent alteration or amendment at
any time prior to final judgment.

Both with respect to Rule

23{c)(1) and of course the court's inherent power to modify
any order that is not a final order.

And Mr. Hackett, if he

ware persuasi.ve enough, night have convinced Judge McCune at
some future date that: ha was wrong and that, the case should
proceed as a class action in the sane way as in the Coopers &
Lybrand, that judge changed his mind and said that the case he
originally thought should proceed as a class action should be
decertified,, and not proceed as a class action.
So it was simply, by its terms, a -tentative provisional
order.

It decided nothing except that for now and until the

judge changed his mind that this would be an individual action
in which others could intervene to assert their rights, but
that it could not be a

class act'd.on.

Nov;, Mrs. Gardner argues that she has a right to
appeal under 1292(a)(1) because the denial of class certi.ficafdon amounted to the effective denial of broad injunctive
relief sought in behalf cf the clients, and therefore constituted
an order of immediate and irreparable consequences within the
meaning of Baltimore Contractorsa

That’s her argument.

The contention is without merit, for a number of
reasons.

Section 1292(a)(1) is clearly, as I've indicated,

intended to provide interlocutory appellate review only for
those orders which directly and immediately either grant or
refuse injunctive reli.ef.
Congress recognized that unless immediate appeal were
permitted, that there could be no affective review of an order,
for example, granting or refusing a preliminary injunction.

25
Asad that to delay review until after a final decision on the
merits would be practical equivalent of no review at alio
It would be impossible to review the grant or denial of the
preliminary injunction after the case had proceeded to a merits
determination, and the court had made a decision.
So, consequently, it adopted 1292(a)(1).
The order Mrs. Gardner appealed from here does not
possess this characteristic, which is essential to a riqht of
appeal under 1292(a)(1).

The denial of class certification

does not amount to the denial of an injunction, and it has no
immediate impact or effect.

It i.s strictly a procedural prs~

trial order which in no way touches on the merits of the
claim.
As a matter of fact, even if this case were appealable
and if the Court of Appeals were to reverse the class certifica­
tion, this would not result in an automatic in juncta.on, the
case would be sent back to -the district court, and the district
court would have to deci.de whether an injunction was appropriate
in thi.s case.

a permanent injunction,

QUESTION:

All right.

What if I'm a defendant,, and

I file a counterclaim, and ask for an injunction, and it's
dismissed for want of jurisdiction?
MR. SCIIEINIIOLTZ:

Again I think that that would be

appealable, for the reason that —
QUESTION:

As a what?

MR. SCIIEINIIOLTZ:

As a fi.nal order with respect to

the counterclaim.
QUESTION: Well, that isn't wh&t this Court held.
MR. SCIIEINIIOLTZ:

That's what this Court held in

GE vs. Marvel, and
QUESTION:

But it held it was appealable under the

predecessor to 1292.
MR. SCIIEINIIOLTZ:

Well, I — you may be right on that,

Your Honor, it did? but the difference between the GE vs. rlarval
case and this case is that there, when the court dismisses the
counterclaim seeking injunctive-'reliaf, it is acting now and
immediately.

That is thca denial of an injunction when it

dismisses a counterclaim. That is the difference between that
case and this case.

Is that there it operates immediately, it

27
operates now, whereas here it may never operate.
Now, even if we were to assume, arguendo, as I've
indicated, that the

denial of class action states rr\av narrow

the scope of injunctive relief, which may ultimately be
awarded, and that's her claim, is this effect will occur, if
it occurs at all, only after a decision on the merits.

And

that's the difference between this case and the G'E vs. Marve 1
case.
And at that time — at that time, when there has been
a determination on the merite, that action is fully re view able
along with the final decision on the merits. regardless of
whether Mrs. Gardner wins or loses with respect to her
individual claim; and that's the United Airlines vs. McDonald
/sic/

Douglas case, recognises teat.
Moreover, and quite apart from that, many types of
interlocutory orders of a trial court have a significant
impact on a litigant's ability to obtain equitable reliefe
And this consideration has never bean revievred as a sufficient
ground for contravention of the strong and explicit congressional
policy against piecemeal appeals.

As a typical example, an

order granting or refusing discovery, where an evidentiary
ruling may have a vital effect on the scope of the relief
ultimately obtained.

And yet that doesn't convert them into

appealable orders*
QUESTION:

You think teat an order granting a pre-

23

limin&ry injuncti.ok. and requiring the plaintiff to post a
$50,000 bond is appealable by the plaintiff as to the question
of the amount of the bond?
MR. SCHEINIIOLTZ:

Well, that's the collateral order

doctrine, or something like the collateral order doctrine, and
would not cone up under 1292(a) (1) , it would coma up under the
/sic/

Cohen vs. Beneficial Insurance Company rule? i believe.
Nov/, we talked about the matter of the docket of
the appellate courts, and I think that i.t i.s a matter of concern
to this Court.
14 of our brief.

We have the statistics set forth at pages 13 to
But briefly, in a 15-year period, from 1962

to 1977, the number of actions filed increased by 300 percent
and the number of -- this is on the appellate docket — and
the number of appeals pending increased by 400 percent.

And

in over half of the Circuits the number of pending cases that
*

have increased, appeals have increased by 600 percent.
That's an alarming statistic.

And if this appeal that

Mrs. Gardner has were allowed, that — there will be no limita­
tion on the number of appeals that you could have.

Because

what would happen is that in ©very case where it is possible a
plaintiff would include a prayer for injunctive relief.

He

would be foolish if he didn't.
And then if there i.s any order that ha says might
affect the scope of relief, then he could take an interlocutory
appeal under 1292(a)(1), because their argument isn't limited

29

to class certification questions.
with that.

The statute doesn't; deal

The principle that he's attempting to assert is

that any time there is an order which might affect the scope
of injunctive relief, then that is the practice.1 equivalent of
the denial of an injunction as appealable under 1292 (a) (1).
And there would be many, many more appeals under that
type of rationale than we have now, as bad as the current
docket is.

Now, —

though, some decisions holding appealable or unappealable?
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:

Yes, there are three Circuits that

hold that tlie denial of certi ficati.on is not appealable under
1292(a)(1).

That would be the Third Circuit, the D. C, Circuit

and the Second Circui t.

The Seventh Circuit says that where

there is no prayer for injunctive relief and no hearing on
preliminary injunctive relief, no right to appeal 'the adverse
class determinati.on under 1292(a) (1), and there are four
Circuits that go the other way.

HR. SCIIEINHOLTZ:
QUESTION:

It is appealable to ~

Individually, but —

QUESTION: Was that an injunction suit?
QUESTION: But if it's granted, it's not appealable;
if it*s denied, it is appealable.
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:

At least it used to be.

You may be correct on that, and

I’m sure I must be in error.
A rule of appealability, based upon the eventual effect
of an order has, of course, no easily definable limit.

And

will provide th© plaintiffs with more than one opportunity
to obtain piecemeal review of a wide variety of interlocutory
orders.

Which would mean that the final judgment rule would
tr

eventually be swallowed up by what Congress intended to be a
narrow exception.
Moreover, such a rule of appealability, we believe,
is clearly inconsistent with Justice Rehnquisfc’s decision in
Wetzel, which held that an order granting judgment on the
merits for the plaintiff, without ruling on th© request for
injunctive relief, was not appealable by the defendants

under

1292(a)(1), despite its inherent effect on the ultimate
availability of injunctive relief.
A rule of appealability such as that advocated by
Mrs, Gardner would further burden the appellate courts with the

32
task of determining, in each case, the j ri i dictional question
of whether the order appealed from had the affect of granting
or denying an injunction. And it would have to do so on the
basis of a record which might well be inadequate for that
purpose.
Now, Hrs. Gardner also argues that 1292(a)(1) should
be extended to interlocutory orders denying class status,
because immediate review might avoid an unnecessary trial and
expense.
Well, it would have done the same thing in Baltimore
Contractors, as Mr, Justi.ce Black mentioned in his dissent, but
that consideration really isn't germane.It's the function of
Congress to determine whether fell a time and expanse that might
be saved by permitting interlocutory appeals sufficiently
outweighs the impact of the effect of permitting those appeals
on the docket of the appellate court.

That?s the function

of Congress.
This Court has repeatedly said that it is not
authorized to approve or declare judicial modification of the
jurisdictional statutes, regardless of the importance of the
issue or other considerations.
We have to look at the statute. Does it permit an
appeal or doesn't it?

This statuta doesn't say that an order,

which directly or indirectly grants an injunction which — nor
does it say ‘that which effectively grants os: denies an injunction

33
is appealable? it. says an interlocutory order granting or
refusing an injunction.
QUESTION:

Counsel,in Wetzel, it was Liberty

Mutual that was appealing.

Liberty Mutal hadn't sought any

injunction. Wasn't that the reason we said that that was not
appealable as an order denying an injunction?
MR. S CHE INHOLT 55:
That's true.

Well, Your Honor, that's true.

On 'the other hand

and it was dictum in that

case, and you were -~
QUESTION:

But you referred to it, and I thought

perhaps you ought to -MR. SCIIEINHOLTZ:

Yes.

No, you're right. But of

course the ultimate impact that, if you adopted their argument,
they could have said that the effect of that order granting
liability was to effectively grant an injunction, even though
the only thing that was left to be done by Judge Weber was to
issue -die injunction.
That's what we mean by that statement.
Sp if you followed an effective standard, you would
. have permitted an appeal in Wetzel, we believe.
Now, for those reason, we believe that the Third
Circuit was clearly correct in its conclusion that Mrs.
Gardner's theory of appealability would represent an unwarranted
expansion of 1292(a) (1).
Now, I'd like to go to the second point that we would

34

argue, and that is that even if the effective denial of an
injunction standard is a correct standard under 1292(a)(1),
that standard has no application here, because the denial of
class certification cannot constitute the effective denial of
an injunction.
We say that for three reasons.
First, because the order was tentative and provisional
under Rule 23(c)(1), it could be altered at any time.
Secondly, because it is by no means clear what
relief, if any, Mrs. Gardner could gat in her lawsuit.

That

fact would not be known until after a final hearing on the
merits.

And to ask an appellate court on a 1292 (a)(1) appeal

to speculate as to what relief she might be able to get, if
she proves her case on 'the basis of an inadequate record, I
think is an unworkable standard and places an i.mpossible
burden on the Court of Appeals.
The plain fact of the matter is that that will not
be known until she puts in her proof.
Nov/, third, of course, is the fact, that at any time
there could be intervention by other persons in the punitive
class.

And if those persons appeal, then the scope of the

relief might be different than if she proceeds with an individual
action, or it might not.
But, again, that is something that will occur at some
time in the future

35

But tlie fact of the matter is that intervention byother people in tills lawsuit might make a difference with
respect to the injunctive relief that might ultimately be
attained and obtained*
So, for both -- for all ‘three of those reasons, we
say the denial of class certi ficati, on cannot possibly constitute
the, effective denial of an injunction*
Now, Mrs „ Gardner makes a point in her brief that if
she is not permitted to appeal now, that, it is likely that
this case will never be appealed, and she says that for two
reasons „
She says, first, "If I lose on the merite, I have no
right to appeal the adverse class determination under
Rodriquez*"

And she says, "If I win on mv individual case, I

will have no incenti ve to appeal
Nov/, the first is incorrect as a matter of law?
the second is purely speculative and irrelevant at best*
First, Rodriquez, as we read it, says nothing about
her right to appeal the adverse class determination after final
judgment if she loses her case*

United Airlines says that*

Secondly, you cannot fashion a rule of law ~~
QUESTION:

If she wins her case, do you think she

can. appeal?
MRo SCIIEINHOLTZ:

QUESTION;

I'm sorry?

If she wins her case, do you think she can

36

appeal?
MR,, SCHEINHOLTZ:
as We 11.

Yes .

American Airlines says that

Because there the Court referred to, and there were

two' cases that were referred to, Galvan vs. Levine and Esplln
vs„ Hirshl, where the plaintiff won below, and where -- and
notwithstanding the fact that she vzon, she was permitted to
appeal the adverse class determinati.on question. And I think
there’s good reason for that.
QUESTION:

Are ‘those Courts of Appeals

MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:

Those are Courts of Appeals

decisions.
QUESTION: Which one?
MR. SCIIEINIIOLTZs
QUESTION:

Both of them.

I know, but which Courts of Appeals?

Well, don’t: bother, don’t bother.
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:

They are in our brief, Mr.

Justice White.
QUESTION:

And they were cited in the opinion —

MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:

They were cited in the opinion in

United Airlines.
And I think there’s good reason for that. For one
thing, attorney’s fees.

Attorney’s fees would be greater,

obviously, if they were class action than if the case proceeded
as an individual action.
Secondly, plaintiff, as she regards herself, or he

37

regards himself, as a private attorney general, may well fee
that they have an insti.tuti.onal interest in attempting to
protect the

punitive class.

So, even 'though they win their case, they will want
to appeal the adverse class determination, and there may well
be other considerations.
But the critical fact isn't that she may not, she
may decide for herself that she doesn't want to appeal, the
critical fact is that she has the right to do so.
And if sh© fails to do so, for whatever reason, under
United Airlines, the punitive members of the class could
intervene at. that time for the purpose of appealing the adverse
class determinati.on»
So there is no question •—
QUESTION:

Just so long as they act promptly.

MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:

Promptly.

With In the time that

she could have done so herself.
QUESTION: Right.
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:

So that, you know, there's no

question that they are protected in that respect.
Now, if you have somebody who is unaware of the
pendency of this class action, and who hasn't filed charges,
I think that the answer to the first part, if they're unaware
of this action, they certainly haven't relied unon its
existence in refraining from prosecuting a claim, and if they

38

haven't filed charges, I suggest it's because they believe
that they haven't been injured.
But, in any event, they would not be barred by
principles of res judicata by anything that happened in this
case,
»

Now, we have other arguments in the case, policy
considerations, and I think they are amply set forth ~~
QUESTION:

You say they may not be injured; they may

b© aided, however?
MR® SCHEINHOLTZ:

They may be what?

QUESTION:

They may be injured, but they might

conceivably be aided by the results of the first case,

MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Anything further, Mr.

H&ckett?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT N. HACKETT, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HACKETT:

Y©s.

In answer to Justice White’s question, the Ninth
Circuit case, Spanglay vs, U.S. held that the striking of
intervention allegations was a denial of an injunction.

It's

cited in our brief,
v

In general, I would like to narrov the grounds of

our appeal to say that they're based on the first, really the

39
first argument in our brief.

That is, the argument that the

immediate result of this order means that a person who had
applied for a job at a W© shingh o us e broadcasting station in
Los Angeles is not going to get injunctive relief this case
if there is no class.

The immediacy is not the immediate

harm fco a person, the named plaintiff, the immediacy argument
is not relevant to the appeal under 1292(a)(1).
There is no legislative history or cases that say
the harm must be immediate.

They say that the harm must ba

irreparable to the case.
Now, there is no defendant that I know of that is
going to say that "I can have an injunction givinq me an
affirmative-action program in the Los Angeles Westinghouse
broadcasting station if I don’t have a class action? if I lose
the class action, I’m never going to get that in this case."
QUESTION:

You say your client is never goinq to get

an, injunction in this case?
MR„ HACKETT:

No, it's not my client, sir.

My

client, Mr. Justi.ce Rehnquist, it’s possible she alone wi 11 get
it. But, the scope of the injunction will not be like under
Teamsfeers vs. U. S. unless it is a perforce case. That is, if
it’s an unconstitufcionality or illegality use of a test.

And

the test is being used everywhere; perforce I would get relief.
But in this particular case, which is an across-theboard situation, there is no way teat the people in various

40

radio stations or people who are discriminated because they
use all male salesmen, if they do, are going to be relieved.
The injunctive relief, as Mr. Justice Stevens pointed out,
would only flow to the individual plaintiff»
QUESTION:

Well, assuming when the final judgment

is made, the class action has bean reinstated, what happens?
MR. IIACKETT:

Well, that's true, Mr. Justice Marshall.

QUESTION: What happens?
MR. IIACKETT:

If it's reinstated, it would have to

go down and be tried all over again.
QUESTION:

No, no.

MR. IIACKETT: As a class action.
QUESTION:

If you hadn't stopped it when you

did

stop it, suppose you had gone on and tried it as an individual.
MR. IIACKETT:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
And just before the judgment, the judge
*

says, "Look, I decided I was wrong about that class action;
bring the class in now."
MR. IIACKETT:

Yes, that could happen.

QUESTION: Could he do that?
MR. IIACKETT:

I believe ~

QUESTION: Could he do teat?
MR. IIACKETT:

I believe that under Mr. Justice

Stewart's language in United Airlines vs. McDonald, there is
soma doubt that after you strip the class of its character,

41
strip the action of the class —
QUESTION:

I thought 'the Rule said specifically

that — the Rule says that it can. be.
QUESTION:

Rule 23(c) , you mean?

MR. IIACKETT:

Yes.

The Rule say3 that —

(c) (1) —

(c)(2) says that it’s conditional.
QUESTION:

Do you want me to ignore that Rule?

MR. IIACKETT:

No, I don’t want you to, sir.

any interlocutory order is conditional.
QUESTION:

But

He can do this --

No, I mean this particular Rule says

that this can be changed.
MR. HACKETTs

Absolutely.

QUESTION: And so th© judge could have changed this
one?
MRo IIACKETT:

The judge can change it, but the order

as it stands, as was said in Y a.ffee vs. Powers, is conditi.onal.
QUESTION:

I know, but you read the point as saying

there was no way that this woman in Los Angeles could get any
relief.

Isn't that what you said?
MR. HACKETT: That is correct, sir, but —
QUESTION;

Do you want to change that?

MR. HACKETT:

Yes, sir, I do.

his mind, absolutely they can gat relief.

If the judge changes
But I call your

attention to 1292 (a)(1) itself, which says that any order
granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunc-

42
fcions, or refusing to dissolve or to modify injunctions.
Nowf •—
QUESTION: Well, what in this order used the word
"injunction"?
MR. IIACKETT:
QUESTION:

In the class denial, sir?
Yes.

It didn't say one word about

injunction.
MR. IIACKETT:
QUESTION:

Ha did not use it. The effect of —
And you hadn’t reached the injunction

point in the case yet, had you?
MR. IIACKETT:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Justice Marshall.
So how can wa use that language?

MR. IIACKETT: Because the cases interpreting the
denial of injunction say you don't have to xise the word.

If

tile interlocutory order has the effect of denying an injunction,
then the law applies.

./v •

In the E ne1ow- -Edison rule, and in all the affirmative
decisions under 1292(a)(1), there was no actual use of the word
"injunction” in many of those casas.
QUESTION;

Well, it could happen in this case that

'this woman is the wrong woman.

So then you're appealing that

now.
MR. IIACKETT:

It's possible, yes.

QUESTION: Because they denied her an injunction.
MR. IIACKETT:

It’s possible that she is the wrong

43
woman, although I don't think that's really the relevant
inquiry to the effectiveness of the order.
QUESTION:

Well, it could have been denied because

sh© moved to Timbuktu.
MR. IIACKETT:
QUESTION:

Well, —

I'm talking about when the case is

finished, which could b© three years from now.
MR. IIACKETT:
QUESTION:

I can't project that far off.

MR. HACKETT:
have to.

Yes, sir.

Yes, but I think 1292(a)(1) says you

If the effect is — just like you would dismiss for

jurisdiction in General Electric, I think it has that effect.
QUESTION: Well, what if it's a result of a refusal
to make discovery on the part of the plaintiff?

The district

court enters an order that a particular paragraph in the
plaintiff's request for instruction will be deemed denied.
Is that appealable under your theory?
MR. IIACKETT:

You have to us© the test of having the

court see if the substantial effect of the order was to deny
an injunction.

It's a substantial effect test.

QUESTION: Well, then, why isn't counsel's argument
in response to my question in Liberty Mutual a perfectly good
one?

Judge Weber in that case had come right dovzn to the wire

and had all but granted an injunction against Liberty Mutual?
MR. IIACKETT: Because it was a pure stage one proceeding,

44
he only found liability, he did not do anything to move forward.
And they did not comply with 1292 (a) (1).
QUESTION:

But it seems to me he was a lot further

along the road to granting an injunction against Liberty Mutual
than your cane was here.
MR. HACKETT:

No, because — I don't believe, because

I think his order only found that a certain procedure was
illegal.

He may not have found that any injunctive relief was

appropriate in that case.

Nor whether there was — was there

a request by the plaintiff or the right party for injunctive
relief.
QUESTION:

But Judge McCune might have found no

injunctive relief was available hera in this. case.

Even though

h© had ruled the other way on your class certification question.
MR. HACKETT:

He could find it, but by throwing the

class out, he has effectively found it already, as to the class.
That's the gist of the argument.
Because we now have no class.
QUESTION:

May I ask, why would there be any

irreparable injury in your case of employees in other radio
stations?
MR. HACKETT: Well, ~
QUESTION: They could bring suit themselves later.
MR. HACKETT: Well, they can, but I think the whole
idea of Title VII in class actions is to have a class action

45
and prevent; a multiplicity of suits.
QUESTION:

Yes, but isn’t it possible that one of

these other employees would b© recognized by a court as being
an appropriate class representative?
MR. HACKETT:

I think it’s possible, but I don’t

think that, in the class situation, we'rs under a legal duty
i

to go out and look for them, or -~
QUESTION:

No, but —

MR. HACKETT; And also the class action, remember,
tolls their statute of limitations.
substantive

After the denial, the

statute of limitations continues to run.

And

they may lose their rights, simply by the fact that the statuta
runs.

And not know about the fact that their right as a

discharged employee, that his statute had run. The class
action device is meant to head that off.
And I believeit does that.
I would like to say, of course, that any interlocutory
order can be modified.

I don’t think there's any question

about that.
And I would like to say that the class action device,
as Spottswood Robinson said, in the D. C. Circuit, is a very
