MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Bordenkircher against. Hayes»
Mr* Chenowefch„ I think you may proceed whenever
you're ready»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT L. CHENOWSTH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, CHENOWETHs

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

the Court:
The question feh© Petitioner presents to Your Honors
by this case is whether an indictment undar an habitual criminal
statute by the State la constitutionally prohibited when it
is brought after .an accused has rejected a plea inducement

offer»
It is Petitioner* s position, and submit it should
be the position of this Court, that the prosecutive procedure
us ad in this case does • not violate any constitutional rights
©f a defendant.
The record in this case is a simple on®, end the
basic facts are not in dispute.

Of importance, though, I

believe, is that the Commonwealth of Kentucky had overwhelming
proof of Mr. Hayes* guilt,
Mr* Hayes had been charged with a. substantive offense
of uttering a forged instrument which, under Kentucky law,
carried a possible sentence of two to ten years in the

4

penitentiary.

Th© pros acufcor offered —

QUESTION®

For forgery of an $88 chock.

MR® CHENOWETHs

this was uttering.

This was not & forgery, Your Honor,

There being a difference of —

QUESTION*

Well, it was uttering an $88 checka

MR. CHENOWETH;

Yes, Your Honor, it was an $88

check..
QUESTION s And you get how many years for that in
Kentucky?
MR. CHENOWETHThe possible penalty range for that
substantive offense is two to ten years.

This is under the

law as it existed prior to our Kentucky Penal Coda. That law
has been changed.
QUESTION;

Good!

[Laughter. 3
MR. CHENOWETH».

The prosecutor offered a sentenc®

recommendation to Mr® Hayes of five years on this uttering
charge®

This offer was* rejected, although Mr. Hayes was

advised, prior t© th© mjaction, that an. enhancement charge
could be brought; in view of Mr. Hayes * two prior felony
convictions.
After the rejection, th© prosecutor old go beck to
the grand jury, did re~indict so as to include in tha indict­
ment

tnhasicement

and th© original substant've

offense of uttering a forged instrusumt.

5
The Petitioner believes that it is important; in this
cas© to consider th© unique character of an ©nhaaceraamt
statute as it* relates to plea negotiatione

This Court, in

Oybar va»_ Boles , indicated that an habitual criminal enhancemeat charge does not create a separ&t® and distinct substantive
offensea
QUESTIONi

Let ra® internet you just a second, if

I may, General Chenowetha
MR. CHENOWETHj
QUESTIONs

Sura.

la th® course of the plea bargaining, did

th© prosecutor offer to drop any of the charges, or ;imply t.c
make a sentence recommendation?
MRa CHENOWETH t

At the time that the plea negotiations

were going on, at a pre'trlal conference -« really two pretrial
conferenceso

At that time these© was only the singular sub­

stantives offans® of uttering a forged instrument.

But iher©

was not — it was really a sentence recommendation possibility,
in that there were no other charges to deal with at Shat time,
Th© basic plea inducement, capability at that time really was
a sentence recommendation.
The enhancement statuta doesn't constitute a sub­
stantive offense, and i think that’s very critical, in view of
th© prosector*s broad discretionary powers in deciding whether
to charge sad what to charge, and especially so as this relatas
to the natural interest, for a number of reasons, of a prosecutor

6

seeking to tantar into piss, negotiations with the criminally
accused0
Tills ca3e, than, involves the timing and the scope
of a prosecutor exercising his charging discretion when the
possibility of an habitual criminal charge exists, & non­
substantive offense# and a plea: negotiation is# nevorthless,
desirable?
Now, if the prosecutor is faced with facts that would
support an indictment on the substantive offensa, ard a non­
substantive enhancement charge, the prosecutor has to decide
whether he wishes to indict the accused as an habitual
offender.

And, if so, 'he has further to decide whether to seek

an indictment on that habitual criminal statute at the time
the principal offense indictment is returned,

Ha is; faced with

that kind ©f decision when he has the facts, initially before
him.
Now, it may

that the prosecutor will decide that;

an indictment is proper under an habitual statuta? but sine®
the prosecutor, in looking at the facts of the case, has

determined that h© iatands to offer soma kind of pic* a
inducement on the sthst^ntive charge, that ho will dueideV,; that
.th® plea negotiations case, proceed more fairly and proceed more
expeditiously if an indictment on tha substantive offense only
is sought at that time,

QUESTIONs Wall, let m® interrupt you there. Why would

7
h@ reach that; conclusion?

Do you think that plea bargaining

is more likely to ensue with ©n initial lighter charge than
the enhanceraeat aspect?
MR® CHENOWETHs

Y@$, very definitely, if 7. understand

your question, Mr® Juatic© Blackmun.

The vary reason that a

prosecutor will cow© to that kind of conclusion, when he has
those facts before him, is that if ha has a strong casef as
there existed in this Hayes case, he has to realize that if he
is going to eater into -any kind of plea negotiations, that
he cannot enter into plea negotiations if then© is an habitual
charge already on the hooks»
QUESTION:

He has —•

Why not?

MR» CHENOWETH;

Well, h® 3ias to b© willing, if h©

has already gcfctsn the case to the posture of having an
habit.ua! charge, ha's going to have to be willing to remove
that habitual charge before ha can go to thus prosecutor [sic]
and say, ”1 am willing to enter into plea negotiations",
because no defendant is* over going to plead guilty to a charge
as long as that enhanceitnent statuta is still on the books *

It

would still continue to enhance whatever the plea arrangement
that was arrived at.
So ifefti prosecutor has to ho willing, if that indictment
on the habitual charge is

brought in the beginning, —*

QUESTION: Fell, you*re coming up from the ether side
©f the case.

Why doesn't, the proseautor bring everything in

8

£h@ original indictment or information?

Every tiling,.

And taka

it from there, with his plea bargaining, if that's what he
wants *
MR* CHENOWETH:

Because if ha *•*“• if he brings

everything, h© is going to have to — and ha desires to go
forward with plea negotiations, he is bringing an elament,
into the negotiations that he really need not bring.

And

that is the habitual criminal indictment.
QUESTION:

But you're saying that he has bo give

away inore ~~
MR* CHEMOWETH:
QUESTION:

That’s really so* —
in order to arrive at a deal.

MR. CHENOWETH;

*•** he does have to give away more.

He has to say to that defendant:
you.

"Her® is what I arr: giving to

And the first thing that I have to gives to you is that

I will be willing to go to th© court and move to dismiss the
habitual criminal indictment. °
QUESTION; Well, doesn’t that, sound like a batter deal
for the defendant, then?
MR* CHENOWETH;

I don’t know why that it should,

in the —
QUESTION;

It isn’t anything that’s strange to the

defendant; h® knows what, his record is.

And he known this is

hanging over him, like a sword, so to speak,

I just don’t

l gusss 1 have trouble following *uty explanation

f why thcs

3
one charge Is initially brought and the

other used as dynamite

in reserve.
MRo

CHENOWETHs

Well, it's really that — it seems

to me, the type of thing that, why should fch@ prosecutor go
forward on a charge, a non-substantive charge, as involved in
this case, and indict on that habitual criminal element of
the case, and then turn right around and be willing

"I've

get it, but now I’ll bs glad to give it away if you’ll go
forward on plea negotiations"0
QUESTIONS

Well, 1*11 give you on© reason that

«eight you nor your opposition suggest — at least I think it's
a reason.

Isn’t bail likely to be higher?
MR. CHENOWETHs

Oh, yes, but we're talking ut that

point, in time of, in fact, a procedure that you are indicating,
of bringing everything in the first instance, that that's
going to work to the detriment of tha defendant, not the
prosecution.
If tha prosecution goes in and indicts on the
initial —
QUESTION:

I realize tills, and I intend to ask your

opponent that same question. But I think this is a consequence
that perhaps is a reason for not bringing the initial on©,
the full charge initially.

But. —
MR. CHENOWETHs

Very definitely.

10
QUESTION %

— I don't: think anybody is being fooled,

everyone knows what fell© record is»
MR» CHEHOWETH.S

Sura, they understand that there ars

prior felonies in existence.

But I think that we are talking

about *»‘« we are talking about two ways to get to the same point;
eitiier bring them from the beginning and be willing to give up
the enhancement IS you're going to go forward on plea
negotiations, ©r if you believe that there's a reasonable
possibility of entering into plea negotiations and arriving at
a plea arrangement, and ©specially you*m going to feel that
way if you have an overwhelming case, as you had hero, of
proof of gui.lt, that the — 'that why got that indictment for
the enhanced"-offense on til© books and than be willing to turn
right around and, in tie statement of on® writer, give the
sleeves off your vast?
anything*

You’re not really giving the defendant

You have to get rid of that ©r you’re never going

to go further on any kind of plea inducement, whether it be
sentence recommendations, charge» dismissal, or having a lesser
included offense type of plea inducement.
So we think her© —
QUESTION:

General Chenoweth, —*

MR. .CHENOWETHs
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr.

*•*- after

Justice?

in your Commonwealth of

Kentucky, after a. grand jury has indicted someone on en
habit.ua! criminal, undfjr your habitual criminal statute, may

11
the prosecutor dismiss that indictment without consent of
the court?

Is he free -to do whatever he wishes to?
MR, CHENOWETH;

Yes # there is # ‘to my knowledge, no

guidance? the courts# on that type of charge# the prosecutor
goes to the court end that charge would be
there is not

dismissed# that

the court has to accept, the motion.

QUESTION $

Just on the prosecutor’s say-so.

The

court -MR. CHENOWETH;
QUESTIONs

But as far as —

It doesn’t require consent of court?

or. if it does# it’s a rubber-stamp operation# is that, it?
MR. CHENOWETHs

Well# consent of the court# to the,

extent you would have to make th@ motion and an orde r would
have to be entered.
QUESTION?

Then It would be pro forma granted.

MR. CHENOWETHs
say# Your Honor.

I think that would bo vary safe to

That this is a matter within that discretion­

ary power of the prosecutor# and the judge is not going to
tall th© prosecutor —
QUESTION;

Well# it’s tli© grand jury who has

indicted# who has brought the indictment.
MR. CHENOWETHs

This is so# upon request of the

prosecutor.
QUESTION'S

Upon the showing of the prosecutor# v@s.
j

MR. CHENOWETH;

Yes.

12

QUESTION % But: this can be dismiss-ad in the »•- in
fact# in practical fact, in tin© unreviewable and untramxneled
discretion of th© prosecutor; is that it?
MRo CHENOWETHt
QUESTION *

I think it’s safe to say that —

As a matter of practice in the Common­

wealth »
MR. CHENOWETH:

— the judge is not going to say tse<

til© prosecutor that you go forward with that which you den’t
want to go forward with*
QUESTIONt

Right.

MRS CHENOWETHs

So, to that extent, I think that it

would be a very, very rare situation where that would be
denied»
QUESTIONj

Yes.

QUESTION: Well, are you really saying that?

As I

understand your answer, you’rsi saying there is no discretion
ea th© part of the court, once the prosecutor takes the position
the court has to go along.
MR® CHENOWETHs

I would not go so strongly as to

say that, no, I don’t intend to say that.
QUESTIONS

Then there is 30m© discretion on the

part of the court.
MR. CHENOWETH:

I think, sure, that there would

exist discretion in the judge, to say to the prosecutor that
aX want to have reason,, 2 want to have some greater showing

13
than a mera"—
QUESTION: Well now, wait; a minute»

Now you’ve given

two different answers 0
I asked for information and you said it was a rubberstamp pro forma operation, and now you're saying something
quite different»

Now, what is th® answer?

MRo CHENOWETHi

Okay, let ma pleas® try amd explain

What l am saying, Mr. Justice Stewart, is that I
think, in almost all situations that, it would be plainly a

QUESTION;

Does your law require that despite — that,

a grand jury indictment can be dismissed only with consent of

First of all, just what the law

provides•
MR® CHENOWETHs The judge does have to pass on it,

Right®

MRo CHEN0WET3:

So, to that extant, it is with the.

there could never be a possibility of the judge denying it.
I cannot say that he hae no choice but to grant it.

But, he

MR. CHENOWETH:

But. I think, undsr soma circumstances,

I cannot begin to say that & judge would —
QUESTIONS

But, in your experience or knowledge,

you’ve never heard ©£ it?
MR. CKENOWETHs
QUESTION?

That is correct.

is that, right?

In the Commonwealth of

Kentucky.
MR. CHENOWETHt

I can vary conscientiously say that,

I"ve never seen & judge ref us© a motion by a prosecutor
QUESTIONs

Or raver heard of it?

MR. CHENOWETHt

No, Your Honor? I can say -.feat I've

a@v©r heard of it, either.
la tills case, the prosecutor did make the -'Iseis ion
to go on tls® substantive charge of uttering only, made the
offer of a .recommendation, sentence recommendation, and at
the same time «•- or at that time of plea negotiations, at the
pretrial conference ~~ did inform Mr. Hayes, as e£ course Mr.
Hayes knew, that he had two prior felonies, that h© could g©
back, that it was an alternative to go back and get the
enhancement statute.
Mr. Hayes, faced with that, with counsel present,
chose to exercd.se his Fifth end Sixth Amendment righ

chose

15
to plead noft guilty and rejected the proffered negotiated
arrangement of the prosecutor0
^•

Now? 1 think that the »— in this situation we have,
from the United States Court of Appeals for the sixth circuit,
w© have a situation of the Court, having said, recognizing
that there are two ways to get to the same point, that if you
do it on® way, that that’s vindictive, that that's in violation
©f constitutional rights®

But if you do it the other way it

is not®
A

By that, we're saying that if you indict in the
beginning on the substantive offense and the enhanced charge,
and then go to the defendant and say, "I'm willing — I got it
a minute ago, now I am willing to move to dismiss it if we
can enter into some kind of plea negotiation®

if not;, we'll

go forward in the trial with the enhancement on the books,
which could subject you to life if you had tv© prior
fa1©ay convicfci©ns«”
But. that iz an accepted plea negotiation, an accepted
ofter* But if you, in the face of, as in, this case, overwhelming
oa&rges, rf you bel^ev*: that a plea arrangement can be entered
and you go only ct. the substantive offense, while
informing that the alternative does exist, that if you then,
after the plea is rejected!, that you go forward and f© teat,
whicu is legally permissible by tee "■•*» the prosecutor go back
to the grand jury, that teat’s vindictive, that that’s in

16
violation of ~—
QUESTION? Well,, tvhat would happen if the prosecutor
said, "W@*v© got. overwhelming evidence of your uttering the
$88 check; we also haw

and you*re indicted for that

we also haw overwhelming evidence that you also ©mbsazled
$460.'

Xf you don't plead on the check, wo* 11 indict you

©n the other one”?
MR. CHENOWETH?

If I understand your question

correctly, we're -talking about comp lately unrelated offenses,
not arising out of £h« same conduct.
QUESTIONj Wall, that's okay?
MR. CHENOWETHs

No, I am not saying that is okay,

I'm not saying that that's really an aspect of this case at
eil;

I think it's a very different consideration.
QUESTIONs

I didn't say, I said it was «— I said

it was entirely different.

Would you find anything wrong

with that?
MR. CHEHOWBTH:

QUESTIONS

I think that here --

Would that be using sioim pres cure?

MR. CHBNOWETHr

No, 1 do net find pressure as being

in violation of dus process at the plea bargaining stage.

1 think the very nature of the plea negotiation stage, or th©
pretrial stage, reoogn5.sd.ng the adversary natur® of the
prosecutor —-

QUESTION r.

Suppose he says, "We .also have over-

17
whelming evidence that your wife also stools $180? if yaii donrt
plead, we’ll indicto liar"?
MR. CHEl'IOWETH g

I think, end certainly we rocogni zq,

as -this Court recognized, as Mr. Chi-af Jus tics Burger i&dicalsed
in tha Santobello case, that: there s.r® limits „
Xfc’s not. a

if those were th© facts before us^

that a prosecutor has

absolute carte blanch® too do whatever he wishes, including

QUESTION;

W-»X1, go back to my original one.

If h©

says, **W® can indict you for another offense, you uttered two checks, on© for $88 and ©a© for $160, and we’v® goto th® best
evidence in the world on both of them? now, we've get you on
the $88 on®, we’ve goto you indicted on that. on®.

If you plead

guilty on that one# w® won’ to indict you on th® other one.”
MR. CSlENOWST.'i ?
plaa negotiations.

I think that is very legitimab*

Hhat wi’r» talking about, in th® language

or some commentators t> this area, is what is called horizontal
overcharging.

And that’s really what we’re talking about

when w® have different, substantive offenses that do not relays
or maybe they do relatos ««that a prosecutor has that
discretion to decide what; to charge. And he really, in a strong
case h© is going -1», in many ins ti&negsi?, charge initially on
those things that, he feels ha is -« that he will fo© abl© to
be®to negotiate a plea of guilty for.

18

Bute ate that point: in time. before we've evsr gene
to the trial process, I think that those kinds of additional
substantive offenses is legitimate® coercion, if you willf if
that's the term that has been used, I think that is legitimate®
coerci.cn» Because teh® very nature of the proceedings ate that
point in time e with the prosecutor having really an overwhelming
amount of discretion»
QUESTION;

Of course, there's som people that woa!t

agree that you can have "legitimate pressure" -~

They're not. the same peoplei

MR. CHENOWETHs

Yes, that may be so, but yot, still,

clearly tea say that, there are people having different view­
points on various aspects —

Sure.

X bfeli®ve everybody agrees ©n tk&te.

MR» CHENOWETH i

We would bo very, very foolish f,o

QUESTION?

Right.

MR* CHENOWETHs

The United States Sixth Circuit

Court of Appeals, in deciding that one way is violation of due
process rights and the other is not# based its decision in
great respect ©a the decisions of this Court in North Carolina
vs,

and the Blads3.otSg>a vs. _F&rry cases.
It eaems that by citing those cases and implying the

rationale of these cases, that the Court, the Sixth Circuit,
seemed to forget that the prosecutor is the natural adversary
of the defendant, and that the prosecutor has to consider
society*s interest in handling criminal cases.
Now, this case, th© Hayes case, is simply not on©
which should be controlled by th® decisions of this Court in
Pearce and Blade ledge.

Petitioner -urges that there should be

no extension of that prophylactic rule of th© Pearce and
Blackledge c«ess.
s-ssj-asi-asrffr;—-'si *p;-s

W« think that the distlnguishment is that in plea
negotiation Idler© is stmm burden constantly existing, th micc­
is e-om&i chilling ©f constitutional rights constantly going ©a.
That' is a very — that is just part of th© plea nage d&tions,
th© pretrial stage of. a criminal proceeding.
QUESTIONs

Your point Is that — well, first, that,

tills Court has explicitly approved the procedure of plea

20
bargainingi and, secondly, that the very concept of plea
bargaining, like the very concept of any bargaining, involves
the us© of leverage or, if you will# of pressure ~~

MR. CHENGWETHi
QUESTION t

Very much so.

— on bo til sides.

MR» CHENOWETH:

Very much so.

Except the prosecutor

probably has an unequal amount of power in 'Shat# at that stag®.
He really has more probably at his disposal than a defendant,
because a defendant basically only has? this s

he has the

Fifth Amendment and he has th© Sixth Amendment.

QUESTION5

Well, he also **-

MR. CHENOWETH?
QUESTIONs

Ha can either exercise those or act.

Well, a

defendant# what the defendant*,

has to offer# first of all# is —~ thare's always & risk# from
the prosecutor's point of view# of a jury finding him not
guilty.

And secondly# there's always the certainty# in a not.

guilty plea, of expending the time and resources of the
prosecutor and of the «court and of the judge, and that's what,
th© defendant —* those are the tools in his hands, aren't
they?
MR® CIIEMQWETH s

Those ar© factors that ©nfcor into

th© very decision of th© prosecutor to select, to go forward
with some kind of plea negotiations, hoping to get a plea
arrangement.

As this Court has indicated# there certainly is

no constitutional right to have plea negotiations &a .ex-ad into.

21
QUESTIONS
constitution&lly.

Buis that, it's perfectly permissible,
Plea bargaining, as such.

MR. CHENOWETHs

Yes.

That, it’s net, per c

unconstitutional, —
QUESTIONt Right.
MR. CHEHOWETHj

— while recognising# in response 1»

Mr. Jus ties Marshall# that -*=•
QUESTIONs

That it can be abused.

MR. CHENOWETHSR:

— there are limits, there are —

oh# sure# there ami b@ an abuse of it.
But we're saying at this stage# at a plea negotiation
stag®, that the difference between what we're t&lkiag of
and what th® court is talking of# what you’ r® speaking of#
and the opinions in North Carolina vs. Pearce and the Black ledge;
v._ Parry case, and the opinions for the Court# is that the
aspects of tho trial#

:>f a right of appeal or exercising that

nature of &, right# that there should be no .shilling affect on

that stage.

It should go forward# really almost la a vacuum.

And if s-on® thing does enter into it, a presumption would enter
in, but there has m&yb® been e. vindictive -» the mar;: fear of
vindictiveness, because that should go forward. The prosecutor
#-t that stage should be virtually an impartial officer of the
court at that times# and not have an interest in that.
But at the plea negotiation stag®# in the very nature
of that process# you do have a chilling? it's already' there.

22
Just; the very nature , no matter what kind of plea
inducement that’ may b© given, that chilling effect is there?
and whether the defendant wants to partake of that negotiated
plea or not, he is going to — and if he decides not to,
irrespective ©f the plea negotiations, he is going to be faced
with the fact that probably, if he rejectas -feli® recommendations
of the prosecutor, that if he goes to trial, the likelihood is
that he will get a greater sens© for having gone to '.trial than
what it would have been had he accepted 3ome kind of
arrangement»
QUESTION:
question?

Mr, Attorney General# may I ask a

If w© assume for a moment it really doesn't matter

whether the man is indicted on all charges and some af©
dismissed, or he’s just indicted on soma and later the others
are added on if he doesn’t enter into a plea? isn’t there,
nevertheless, perhaps a different problem that this cane
indicates, and that is this:

that if there is a gross

disparity between fch® charge that the prosecutor is willing
to abandon, whether in advance of negotiation or later, and
the lesser charge that he really wants to got a conviction or.,
danger
isn’t there acme risk that a quite remote/of conviction on a
charge that might bring life imprisonment or death or something
like that, for the prosecutor to giva up that possible result
in exchange for a 30-day sentence# wouldn’t it inherently make
you wonder whether there- wasn’t sufficient in terrorem effect

23
that an innocent man might; plead guilty to ih© lighter charge»?
Isn't that th© problem, as the comparison between v/hafc one
side is willing to give up in exchange for what he gats,
rather then the timing of it?
MR* CHEHOWETHs

No, I believe not* Because this

same possibility is going to exist if the prosecutor, in the
very beginning, indicts on that substantive offense and ■fee
non-substantlv© enhancement and says, "I am willing to give
that" —
QUESTIONS

Well, I agree* That does not go to the

question that you*vs been arguing, e® to whether the; one has
to coma ahead of the other, in terras of the prposdm a.

But

isn't there a potential for prosecutorial abuse in -■ :m kind
©f situation I described?

And then, to go further, what war©

the alternatives in this case?
opposed to what?

On® was life sentence as

Five years?

MR* CHENOWETH s

Five years recommended; two to ten

osi the substantive charge if going to trial*
Sc therms is that — there is that difference*

But

what I*m saying is that the decision of the Sixth Circuit
indicatas that the point in tint© is the important critical
factor, and I'm seying thay were wrong*
QUESTION:

I understand, and I understand your

argument about 'that* But you did sesra to suggest there art
limits to what the prosecutor might do. And I'm really asking

24
you whether on© of thos© limits is not; having charges ‘that
ara so disparate that an innocent nu?n might fo© tempted to
plead guilty to a very minor charge in order to avoid risk
of conviction, of a very major charge; is that a possible
limit?

If not# what limits are there?
MR. CHEHOWETHs

Well# I think there are limits# but

I do not think that's one of them. Because if wcs're. talking
about that, which is not an aspect of this case# bul certainly
an aspect of plea negotiations# we*re talking about feat
possibility of bringing multiple substantive offenses by their
sheer number and offering to enter into & plea negotiation
for a plea of guilty on only one of those; that that's a
possibility the prosecutors have utilised also,
QUESTION: Well# in answer to Mr* Justice Marshall# I
understood you to s&y it doesn't matter whether the charges
are related or unrelated.

That's not the touche tone *

I svsan#

you could follow the s-iiaa procedure her® with two totelly
unrelated events *
MR. CHEUOWETM

I think unrelated substantive

offenses, or they may bo r3latad but. separate elements of the
substantive offense.
QUESTION5

A
But what# if any# is fe© limit

or

the

discretionary which sh >«id guide the prosecutor in this kind
of negotiation?

Should we not bo concerted about thi risk

that an. innocent man may be induced te plead guilty to a minor

25

charge in, this kind of negotiation?

Isn't that what we're

really concerned about?
MR. CHENOWETH:

But that, is the concern of plea

Yes, but is there any limit to the

discretion, that you —
MR* CHENOWETHs

Well, sure*

So how do you **-* where is it? Where do

MR. CHENOWETH%

Well, it’s very difficult. Thera

are such & ranges of plea negotiation possibili tries, that w®
could go down the line of those ranges and offer various,
what might be considered limits.

I will say that®

So far, in the cases ia this Court, rather

QUESTION:

Y:aa®

And the Court, while it may have,

and probably has, talked about the fact that there are some
limits, it hasn't in any way tried to define» the metas and
bounds of those limite...

Rather, it's been concerned with the

showing that the promise be kept? isn't that correct?
MR® CHENOWETH:

Well, as you indicated, Your Honor,

in the Allison case, is that just getting this plea icegotiation
thing out on the table, go to speak, we're just starting to
look at it, and Your Honor says "Bring it cut and you do have

27
to consider it”*
But at this point in time, our guidance from Your
Honors on plan bargaining is that if you rn&k® promises,
whether it’s one attorney in the Attorney General's office
or another ona, it’s to be brought, out»
QUESTION:

Th© bargain — that if a bargain is

struck, it must bo kept»
MR. CHENOWETH:
QUESTION:

That’s correct»

Then, I suppose, if there's actual

coercion, then it's not bargaining any mors? that is, if
there's brutality, compelling & person to plead guilty, or
trickery or deception, then it’s no longer bargaining»
We had a pgr curiam not so long ago involving that kind of a
situation»
MR. CHENOWETii:

Mr. Chief Justice very much

indicated that those •— mid I think w® go Lack to Mi ihlbroda,
which Your Honor also wrote, where you talk about that fact.
QUESTION:

But it’s fair bargaining, the Court so

far hasn’t defined any limits.
MR. CHENOWETIIs

Pair bargaining» that is exactly

what we say clearly here is fair bargaining, it is within the
nature of the plea negotiation process„
QUESTION 5

I suppose the concepts ©f the federal

laber laws aren’t very helpful, although they uses the sums
words, or 1 did.

28
QUESTION;

Mr, Chenoweth, isn’t: one of the c©asa«

quences of a habitual offender statute the fact that; the crime
which finally brings the parson within the terms of, say, &
four-time offender statute itself may carry a fairly light
sentence, whereas the habitual offender statute, simply by
virtu© of the number of crimes, may carry a very severe
sentence?
MR® CHENOWETHs

Very definitely so®

And this —

while these are arguments, or that the disproportionai argument
type of argument that has been presented in some of the lower*

?
federal courts, Hart vs. Coyner, that you have really minor
felony convictions, if you will — I don't know what, "minor”
is, but that is an argument that’s been presented by defense
counsel, that to have these minor felony convictions, and
although you have, say, four of them, that then the prosecutor
goes forward and indicts on multiple offenses, multiplo
felony offenses, irrespective of their weight, and then goes
forward, and the possible punishment, if convicted on that
last crime, last felony, is life in the penitentiary®

QUESTION: Wall, tell in® again —perhaps you’ve

prosecutor thinks society's interest demands prosecution for
th© mor® serious offense, they ought to put it in the; indicte

31
MR® CHENQWETH:

But 1 think that that is an

incorrect conclusion that you make the decision as e. prosecutor
when you are faced with an enhancement possibility in a
substantive offense? that if you don't indict in the very
beginning on the ©nhanc&nmnt statute, that you have matte the
decision that the crime is not bad enough, or this io not
someone that we have an obligation to society bet cause of the
prior felonies — and her® we had two prior felonies within
a tsn~yc«r, ten or eleven-year period of time, with five of
those years having been in the penitentiary, that that does
preclude, the mere fact, you don't bring it in thus first ins tar.c®
doesn't precludes fch® fact that that prosecutor has on his mit.Z.
that if he cannot enter into a plea negotiation, in view of
the overwhelming evidence, that he should not, in thy interest
of society, then indict for the habitual felony offender, so
that the punishment that the statutes authorize should be
placed in the casca for consideration by a jury®

Mr. Aprils®
ORAL ARGUMENT OF J* VINCENT APRILE II, ESQ®,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR® APRILS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it pleas® the

Court:
I would like to initially point out that this case

32
retaliation from stopping or chilling anyone from exercising
a constitutional right,, such as
QUESTIONs
MR, APRILEs

Or a statutory right of appeal*
Or a statutory right or a procedural

rules right, perhaps.
But the point there was that the man had the oppor­
tunity to do something that was legitimate.
In ths next instance we have something legitimate
done with actual vindictiveness, and 1 believe it was Mr,
Justice Powell pointing out in Michigan vs. Payne, vje*va
always recognized actual vindictiveness, even th® doing of
something that is permitted with actual vindictiveness would
be a due. process violation.

In this case, the actual

vindictiveness was to cay, ,5I£ you will exercise your
constitutional right to a trial before a jury, to plead not
guilty, to have the right to confront witnesses against you,
to be free from self-incrimination, I'm going to put a penalty
on it, and that's the sole reason I'm doing it.*
And th© Sixth Circuit found this in the penultimate
paragraph of their opinion, when they clearly saids T-Je don't
need to infer vindictiveness in this case, it has bean
admitted by the prosecutor.

Then if plea bargaining com©» to an

That's the whole nature of the

MRo APRILE*

I don’t believe so. Your Honor,

I would harken bade to this Court’s analysis in

I don’t balieva — I desa’t "relieve

that is always the result of the same magnitude.
tii© difference in till© cesa.

And -that’s

34
Lati me give you this example.

In the

cm a

at bar,

the initial bargaining position that the defendant was in,
when h© stood charged with the uttering of a forged instrument
indictment, unenhanced, was that h© faced, if he pled not
guilty, he faced a maximum sentence of ten years#
tli@ ante for exercising his constitutional rights.

That was
Those were

the —*
QUESTION s

But he was told in the process of the

bargain what the result would be.
MR, APRILEs

No, Your Honor,

in

th® initial —*

what I’m saying, when the indictment came down, this was what
ha faced if he exercised his constitutional rights,

Then

the prosecutor cam® to him and tendered to him the fallowing
offers

"Plead guilty.

X will give you — I will recommend to

the judge a five-year -sentence,

No guarantee.”

The defendant than said, —QUESTION:

And didn't the prosecutor further say,

"And if you don’t plead guilty" what’s going to happen?
MR. APRILE:

No, Your Honor, not at that, point.

When, from the record, we sse that when th© arrangement offered
by the prosecutor was rejected, he then threatened that "If
you don’t accept, my plea bargain and plead guilty, I am going
to increase the stakes against you.

I’m going to re-iadict

you as a habitual criminal with two prior fiilcni.es, «nd if wo
can convict you of that, there will be: a mandatory life

35

sentence.”
Now, I submit ta you, til© distinction is vary
difforent, because where he placas the threat on him after
he has attempted to exercise his constitutional rights, the
only purpose for the threat is to deter the exercise of the
constitutional rights»
In the situation that the Sixth Circuit, posited was
“Put your cards ©a the table, tell the man what th® charges
are, what's th© maximum punishment ho faces»

If he refuses

to negotiate with you, he still faces that maximum punish­
ment. r

You say this is also my question.

to vary little?
MR. APRILSs

Your Honor, file first point I would

MR» APRILEs

Because* Your Honor* it is clear to

Paul Lewis Hayes and people in his situation, whan they
exercise their constitutional rights to plead not guilty and
turn down a plea bargain offer, are punished for it»

And it

Your Honor, that's a very interesting

point that you make. The actual record in this case reveals
that Mr. Hayes* attorney, trial attorney — I was not his

did not males this objection.

But at the

beginning ox the criminal portion <£ the trial, Paul Lewis Hayes

MR. APRILS*

Your Honor, I think that the reality 1»,

40

this situation is that in Brady vse United Stetos you, writing
— as X recall, you, writing that opinion, pointed out that!
it would b« unconstitutional to hold that prosecutors couldn’t
extend us benefits concessions, dismissed counts, and to allow
pleas to lower lesser-included offenses of the charged
offenseo
And l thought it was important that you emphasized
8th@ charged offense”«
In this cases we8 rs not talking about concessions
relating to a charged offtans©. This man was told, "If you
don't, negotiate, we will up the ant® against you,”
QUESTIONs

Wall aw, that's important, Mr* April©,

It seems to me it may be a subtle diffaresnca, but it. strikes
mo that it might be a dispositive or.®.
You've stated this casa so far as though there were
Pi@a bargaining within vh© original charge, as .indeed there
was? but that that was hh© extent of the plea bargaining,

on the count of uttering the forged check,

An offer by the

prosecutor to recommend a fivs-yaar sentence.
And that; after that plea bargaining failed, then,
without any further opportunity to the defendant, the prosecutor
wpnt on his own hook and got the grand jury to indie... on tine
habitual criminal statute, with no further opportunity for the
defendant to bargain, «.«.d thereby the prosecutor penalised the
defendant's const&tutionsl right to plead not guilty.

41
Now, that would be on® ca$e, it, seems to r.;s»

But

if, ®a th© other hand, the other cas® would be, if the
chronology were that there was- bargaining under the original
charge and the defendant said, “No, I think I*m going to plead
not guilty", then the prosecutor said, "Well, if you do that,

I’m going to go to the grand jury and get them to indict under
the habitual criminal statute, under which you could get life
imprisonment»w

Mra April®, may I interruptthere?

If

you focus on actual vindictiveness, as I guess this is the
standard you would suggest, what if you had this situation:
that a prosecutor presents to the grand jury a oh arc a of
utfcsring an $88 forged check and a second charge of.

count of habitual criminal charge, which bears a life sentencei
at the time he does so, h® has no intention whatsoever of
going to trial on the second charge*

He presents the charge

to the grand jury solely for file purpose of having & bargaining
ticket which he cam use to coerce the defendant into pleading
guilty to the $88 charge.
Could one not call that actual vindlctlvenass ?

MR. APRILEs

But he can't legitimately bring it, and

therefor© what h© doss is he gives away a valid concession
for his goal to get a guilty plea.
In this case, what we're saying is he had already
made an election that there was no interest of the Stats served
by that habitual criminal statute indictment.

QUESTION:

And so —»

Well, the same interest is served in

induce a guilty plea on the first count.

X don't know why

it can be right in one context and wrong in th® other.

MR. APRILE s

But th®r© has been no attempt at that

point by the defendant to exercise any right, and therefore
there is no retaliation that takes place for the exorcise
of the right to plead not guilty.
If plea bargaining is legitimate, and of course we
don’t challenge that, it is clear, under your opinion in Brady
vs.0. Units d 3 tat© s, it’s based on con csss ions being made under
existing charges, and it's based on mutuality of advantage.
And I submit to you that that is a different:
situation from where a prosecutor initially makes a determination
that this is a proper charge, and when h© can't get the
absolute agreement, word for word, that h© wants from fix©
defendant, then ha turns around and says, "X will seek higher
and greater charges against you.*

And this is what the

Sixth Circuit was afraid of.

Because that is a different situation»

In this case th© prosecutor, by his own admission,
wanted to penalise Paul Lewis Hayos for not pleading guilty,
for not saving the court tints, for not saving his prosecutorial
resources, for, not giving the certainty of a guilty plea»
It was not an attempt to bargain, to work something out? it
was that "if he won’t do it my way, then I Insist, then I
will punish you in. another way.”

that fails?
