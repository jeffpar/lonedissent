MR. CHIEF. JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Frey,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, .ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FREY:

Thank you* Mr. Chief Justice* and may it

please the Court:
This case is here on writ of certiorari to review the
Judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit holding that Respondent's grand Jury testimony was
properly suppressed In the exercise of that court's supervisory
powers.

This case arose when Respondent was called to appear

before a special organized crime grand jury in I

s Eastern

District of Nevi York investigating extortion and debt collec­
tion activities.

J

The grand jury was being conducted by a strike force
attorney from Washington who had been specially assigned by
the Assistant Attorney General for the purpose of conducting
the Investigation.
The Government rad evidence that Respondent* while
employed as a skip tracer by one Frankie Provenzano* had
uttered threats against the life of a gambling debtor to that
debtor's brother.

When Respondent appeared before the grand

/

jury, she was given careful explanation of her right not to

4
answer potentially self“incriminating questions and of her
right to the assistance of counsel who could be available to
her outside the grand jury roan.
perjury laws.
investigation*

She was also told about the

She was not told that she was a target of the
And, during the interrogation, she x«jas not

told that the Government possessed evidence directly contra­
dicting her testimony.

In the course of her testimony, she

flatly denied the conversation involving the threat to the
debtor’s brother.
The grand jury indicted Respondent both for the sub­
stantive offense of transmitting a threat and for perjury in
denying the existence of the conversation.

The District Court

suppressed Respondent’s grand jury testimony on grounds sub­
sequently invalidated by this Court in United States _v^
Man.clujano and United States v, Washington.

The Court of

Appeals upheld the District Court's action, not on the con­
stitutional ground, but on the b04Sis of its supervisory powers.
It exercised these powers in response not to any violation of
Mrs, Jacobs' rights, but So the irregularity It perceived in
the failure of the Strike Force attorney to follow what the
court understood to be the uniform practice of the U,S.
Attorney's office in that district and in the circuit generally
to advise prospective defendants of their status as grand jury
targets when they were called to appear before the grand jury;
y

■

The Court of Appeals stated that the exclusion of

5
evidence In this case was a one-time sanction which it said It
was Imposing for didactic purposes.

I might say parenthetically

that the lesson that it meant to teach the Government is not
altogether clear to us from its opinion.

It explicitly dis-

avows any intent to require the giving of target warnings.

And

while; it speaks broadly at some points of uniformity in prose­
cutorial practice and making equal justice available to all
-- both commendable goals and with which we wholeheartedly
concur — at other points its opinion seems quite explicitly
to limit its concern to uniformity within a single district
and even more specifically to conformity of Strike Force
practice to the practice of the United States Attorney’s
office.
QUESTION:

It would not apply in the Eastern District,

only In the Southern?
MR. FREY:

Well* this was in the Eastern District.

QUESTION:

Then it would not apply in the Southern?

MR. FREY:

As far as I can tell from the opinion* the

Eastern District and the Southern District would not have to
follow the same practice.

Indeed* I don’t think two U.S.

attorneys would have to follow the same practice.

What would

be required* it isn't clear, but what they expressly state is
that the Strike Force attorney must follow the practice of the
United States attorney.
QUESTION:

Wasn't the didacticism — if that's a

6
word — Implied?

Doesn't the record hint rather strongly of

that?
MR* FREY:

Well# the opinion suggests that what they

were concerned about was the Intrusion of alien Strike Force
attorneys from Washington into New York to conduct business
that I think the court felt might have been better conducted by
the United States Attorney*s.office.
QUESTION;

And in conducting that business to deviate

from the established practice of the U.S. Attorney’s office In
that district,
MR. FREY;

That was what the court was concerned

QUESTION;

So that is what the opinion is about#

about.

rightly or wrongly# isn't it?
MR, FREY;

Well# there are other intimations of

broader principles of uniformity in prosecutorial practice#
generally# so that I am not clear.

I assume# at a minimum#

we Ceil distill the lesson that the Strike Force attorneys ought
to follow ground rules of U.S, Attorneys.
Now# whatever the lesson that they meant to teach#
the questions that this Court must decide are essentially two.
The first is whether the Federal courts possess# ae part of
their supervisory powers# the power to exclude evidence as a
remedy for pretrial prosecutorial conduct that the court finds
distasteful but that does not violate the defendant’s

7
constitutional or statutory rights.
The second is* assuming that such power exists in
at least some cases, was it appropriately exercised in this
case?
We submit that the proper answer to both questions is
no, end we have advanced several arguments in our brief any one
of which, if accepted, would compel reversal of the decision of
the Court of Appeals.
Before turning to the arguments, 1 want to inform
the Court of a recent development that has at least background
interest for this case.

On December

16,

1977* the Department

of Justice issued significant amendments tc the United States
Attorneys Manual on the subject of Grand Jury practice.

Under

these procedures, grand jury witnesses are now receiving with
the subpoena a nr in ted advice of rights form

wb:

'* briefly states

the nature of the grand jury’s inquiry and advises them of their
self-incrimination and counsel rights.

The content of this

advice is essentially what was told to Mrs. Jacobs when she
was in the grand jury in this case.
In addition, the ne’w internal guidelines direct that
targets of the grand jury's inquiry be advised that their
conduct is being investigated for possible violation of
Federal law.

A target is defined in the new manual provision

as, quote, Sia person as to whom the prosecutor has substantial
evidence linking him to the commission of a crime and who, in

8
the judgment of the prosecutori Is a putative defendant*"
These new manual provisions represent an effort by the Depart­
ment to achieve greater uniformity of prosecutorial practice
in the conduct of grand Juries, the same goal the Court of
Appeals sought to foster by suppressing Respondent's testimony.
Mow, the fact that the Department has instituted
these procedures makes this case, if anything, more important
than before, in our view.

If the judicial supervisory power

is held to extend to suppression of evidence, related to prose­
cutorial departure from uniform practice, there will be a new
category of suppression hearings to which criminal defendants
will be entitled.
In addition to Hiranda claims. Fourth Amendment
exclusionary rule claims, Vfade-Stova 11 cla 1ms, and the like,
the courts will have to entertain Jacobs suppression motion
based upon allegations that internal guidelines relating to
prosecutorial practices or that consistent informal prosecutor­
ial practices have been violated.
These inquiries will not always be easy, since there
are innumerable areas of prosecutorial activities in which
standard practices have developed informally or are called for
by the United States Attorneys Manual.
Looking just as the aspect involved in this case, the
concept, of a grand jury target is a slippery one, especially in
the context of an investigatory grand jury.

Often a witness,

3
and Mandujano or Wans or Mrs» Jacobs are all examples* will be
someone who could be indicted but who the grand jury is really
more interested in as a source of information leading to higher
ups.

In other words* there will be room for considerable con­

troversy in interpreting these prosecutorial guidelines and the
courts will be shouldering a significant added burden in under­
taking to supervise prosecutorial conduct by determining —
QUESTION:

Which courts are you talking about?

MR, PREY:

Federal courts.

QUESTION:

MR. PREY*,

QUE3TI0N:

Appeals Involved In this case is not complaining about -MR. FREY:

Well* I think the Court of Appeals*

perhaps* didn’t fully consider in this case what the effect
would be of a rule that says whenever the -QUESTION:

I assume you know more about the business

of the Second Circuit than the Second Circuit does.
MR. PREY:

I don't assert that.

QUESTION:

How many districts are there in the Second

ME. FREY:

I believe there are six.

Circuit?

QUESTION: The action of the Court of Appeals is to
make all of them conform to one of them* is that it?

10

MR* PREY:

It’s not ciear»

I mean there is going to

have to be a lot of further litigation as to what degree of
conformity is required and what kinds of departures from norms
of prosecutorial behavior ivould justify .a remedy such as
Mrs, Jacobs got in this case.

I mean I think it will be a

fertile field for further litigation.
But 1 do want to say that wholly apart from consider­
ations of increased judicial workload that would result from
adding Jacobs-type suppression motions* there is a serious
question of the legitimacy and of the efficacy of judicial
efforts to enforce nonsfcatutory and nonconstifcutional standards
of prosecutorial conduct.
Inherent in the voluntary adoption by the Executive
Branch of such practices* is the expectation that the inter­
pretation and the enforcement of these practices will be for
the Executive Branch.

If judicial sanctions are going to be

imposed for violations of voluntarily adopted internal prose­
cutorial practices* the wisdom of adopting such standards in
the first place will have to be re-examined,
QUESTION:

Would this mean that

If

in one district

— in one circuit with a great many districts one district
decided, or the Attorney General decided that in on® district
they would conduct a pilot program to give the full target
warnings* the most that has been asked by anyone* that that
would mean under this approach all would have to comply with it*

forthwith?
MRe FREY;

X think that at this stage that would

a speculative matter and X am not prepared to character­

ize the Court of Appeals decision as going that far.
be construed to go.that far.

It might

It's the first step toward a policy

of uniform national prosecutorial practice.

But, however small

the first step may be that the Court is taking in this case, I
don't think it should be taking that step at all.

And in this

connection, I refer to your statement on Court of Appeals in the
Newman case which dealt with the question of the legitimacy of
judicial inquiry into whether prosecutors have conformed to
their own standards of behavior.

This is set forth at page 28

of our brief.
You said there, and I quote, "It is assumed that the
United States Attorney will perform its duties and exercise its
powers consistent with his oaths.

And while this discretion is

subject to abuse or misuse, just as is judicial discretion, de­
viations from his duty as an agent of the Executive are to be
dealt with by his superiors."
That seems to me to be a powerful consideration that
the Court of Appeals has not given due regard to.
In any event, pragmatic considerations aside, we do
contest the power of the courts to apply the sanction of evi­
dentiary exclusion under their supervisory power in cases such
as this.

i
12

Before discussing our arguments -QUESTION:

You say "in cases such as this."

If you

left those words out, would you say there is no power in the
Court of Appeals, in the exercise of its supervisory power, ever
to order the exclusion of evidence, except on one of the grounds
already recognized, such as a Fourth Amendment violation or a
coerced confession or a Wade violation, whatever the list would
be?

It can never order exclusion of evidence?
MR, FREY:

I think I ought to divide my response into

the different headings, because,as I indicated, we have several
quite different and independent arguments.
Under Rule 402, I think that the supervisory power to
exclude evidence has been taken away, but that does not, it seems
to me

It doesn't In any way undermine the result in Weeks

and in the constitutional exclusionary rule cases.
QUESTION:

No, but I was saying is your submission

that a Court of Appeals may never go beyond what is now the law
with respect to exclusion of evidence, it could never find an
action by a Strike Force lax^yer coming into a district which
violated a lot of local rules never a basis for suppressing
evidence?

Evidence which is relevant, of course,
MR, FREY:

I don't think that that's our position.

First of all, if the action violates a statute, a rule or the
Constitution, then I think there may be room under Section 402
for the application of Rule 402 for the application of an

13

ex cius 1ona ry rule.
As far as Inherent supervisory power is concerned -**
that Is assuming you reject our argument under Rule 402 and under
Section 3501* I don’t suggest that there is no power at all to
exclude evidence.

\

MR. FREY:

I think that would be right.

QUESTION:

Was there a manual ever issued from the

Department of Justice dictating the result that this -~
MR. FREY:

At the time that this took place* what we

were dealing with was a purely informal practice within the U.S.
Attorney's district and there was no provision in the manual
requiring the giving of target warnings.
Indeed* the Court of Appeals when it made its inquiry

14

the first time the appeal was before it asked the wrong question,
because they asked what the practice was at the time they were
hearing the first appeal.

And they didn't even ask whether at

the time Mrs, Jacobs testified there was any practice in the
Eastern District to give target warnings.
In any event, let me try -- In ray first argument, I
focused largely on the point that even assuming that there is
some supervisory power in this area, it was improperly exercised
by the Court of Appeals in the circumstances of this case.
Today, I'd like to focus a bit more on our arguments
regarding the various limitations on the reach of the judicial
supervisory power, which wa believe entirely foreclosed the uses
of a remedy of evidentiary exclusion in a case such as this,
if I may use that term.

I will elaborate a little more as I

go along.
I'll begin with Rule 402 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence.

I think it is undisputed by anyone that the super ­

visory power of the courts is subject to statutory restriction.
And we submit that Rule 402 does eliminate whatever power the
courts previously enjoyed to apply the remedy of evidentiary
suppression, except in the circumstances specified by the rule,»
Now, the rule begins by saying all relevant evidence
is admissible.

If this were all it said, the Court of Appeals

might have been correct in concluding that the rile was not
designed to and did not circumscribe pre-existing Inherent

15

supervisory powers.

However, the rule says more.

It explicitly

delineates the exceptions to the general requirement of admis»
sibilifcy that the court's are empowered to recognize.
The rule is set forth at several places in our brief,
I am looking at page 14 of our brief.

It- Says, "All relevant

evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the
Constitution of the United States, by Act of Congress, by these
rules"»» that is the Rules of Evidence

"or by other rules

proscribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority."
Moreoever, the adoption of Rule 402 was accompanied by
an amendment to Rule 25 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Pro­
cedure which eliminated the provision which had been relied on
in Elkins, for example, as conferring upon the courts a general,
in a sense, common law power to formulate rules of evidence under
their inherent supervisory powers.
QUESTION:

Mr, Frey, when you say inherent super­

visory power, do you mean anything more than the authority of
any appellate court to rev arse a trial court on a basis not other
-» on the basis that doesn't depend on the statute or Constitu­
tion?
MRo FREY:

Well, I would distinguish, I think, two

categories of cases, and I intend, after discussing Rule 402,
to turn to the question of, apart from the statutory arguments,
what I do think are the limitations on the supervisory power.
So, perhaps, I could defer it to that point.

16

I want to be sure that the limitations of our argument
about Rule 402 are understood,

We are not calling into question

In any way the power of the Federal courts to apply the remedy
of evidentiary exclusion when that remedy is necessary to pro­
ject constitutional rights,

The Weeks decision stands unimpaired,

in our view.
The more difficult question is when we come to viola­
tions of statutory rights or of rules.

Now* it is clear from the

rule that if a statute or a rule listed in Rule 402 explicitly
provides a remedy of evidentiary exclusion* of course* that
remedy may be enforced by the courts agreeably to Rule 402.
And an example of that is the wiretap statute which contains
various exclusionary principles some of which are not consti­
tutionally required.

But if the statute or rule does not

specify exclusion of evidence as a remedy* than there is a close
issue.
The rule on its face would appear to foreclose exclu­
sion in such circumstances* since admissibility must* according
to the language* be provided by the Constitution* statute or
rule.

But* in any event* whether the court has the power in

enforcing a statute or rule listed in Rule 402 to exclude evi­
dence ancillary to that finding of a violation* there is no way*
it seems to us* that its power under Rule 402 continues* if it
ever did* to reach out where there is no constitutional violation*
no statute —*

17
QUESTION: Whafc about a Miranda ease, where there is
no constitutional violation, just a failure to give the warning
as specified?
MR, FREY:

Well, I think: that Miranda and Mapp stand

on essentially the same footing, that is the court.

What the

court determines Is that there has been a constitutional viola­
tion and that -QUESTION:

tionally mandated.
MR.FREY:

that extends, perhaps, beyond the -QUESTION:

Where there is no constitutional violation

at all, just -MR. FREY:

We are getting onto very slippery ground,

but since it is clear that this rule is applicable against the
States, it must have a constitutional footing,

Mow, it seems

to me that what the court has done -- and let's take Mapp as an
example because, of course, prior to Mapp it wasn't clear that
the exclusionary remedy was available against the State's for
Fourth Amendment violations.
What the Court must be saying is that there has been
a violation of constitutional rights or conduct of such a nature
in the Miranda case that we can't distinguish it from a viola­
tion of constitutional rights.

We are going to treat it

18

presumptively as a violation of constitutional rights.

And the

only way we know to enforce those rights, the only remedy that's
available to us, is the exclusionary principle.
QUESTION:

Supposing the McNabb case were to arise

today as a case of first impression, it hadn't been decided
before.

Vie would have to admit that confession, I suppose.

A

MR, PREY:

Wall, you would certainly have to under

Section 3501, but if Section 3501 did riot excist -- That's the
issue that I am saying is a difficult issue.

I could see an

argument which would say -- and I would probably be on the other
side of it

but I could see an argument itfhich would say that

just as the exclusionary rule is necessary to enforce Fourth
Amendment rights even though the Fourth Amendment doesn't
explicitly contain an exclusionary rule, so the MeNabb-Ma11ory
rule is the only way of enforcing the rights that are protected
by that particular statute.
QUESTION:

So are McNabb and Mallory Constitution or

MR, FREY:

That was a Rule 5(a) or, in effect, the

Rule 5(a)?

statutory provision.
i

QUESTION:

So you had a built in exclusion by the

will of Congress?
MR. FREY:

No, I don't think Rule 5(a) contained any

exclusionary dictate from Congress.
QUESTION:

It was a judicial creation.

Are you sure in both McNabb and Malio:"v

19

that that's the case?
MR, FREY:

I think that that's the case, and I think

that Congress has now passed a statute which expressly deals with
the question of exclusion In relation to violations of the
prompt presentation to a magistrate requirement,
QUESTION:

It is statutory now clearly* is it not?

MR, FREY:

Yes,

QUESTION:

Not constitutional?

MR, FREY:

It is not constitutional* but I was re­

sponding to what I understood to be a question from Mr, Justice
Stevens that what would happen in the McNabb-Mailory situation
under Rule 402* and I was saying that I think it would be
arguable and* indeed* if you look at the advisory committee
notes in connection with the adoption of Rule 402* they seem
f

to contemplate that a Me Na bb -Ma 11 o ry kind of exclusionary rule
would survive.

So you would have to balance the language of

the rule against the contemp3.ation that where it's used to en­
force a statutory right* such as in Me Na bb-Ma11ory it may still
exist.

But that's neither here nor there for purposes of your

problem today.

Nobody has pointed me to a constitutional pro­

vision* a statute* a rule of the kind listed in Rule 402 on
which the Second Circuit could predicate its decision.
Mow* leaving our statutory argument and turning to
the question of inherent power* assuming there were no statute*
I want to preface my remarks on this point by stating that we

20

don't for one minute deny the existence of substantial super»
visory powers in the Federal courts.

The cases cited by Justice

Marshall in his dissent from the initial remand in this case
unquestionably established that such powers exist.
issue here is the nature and extent of those powers.

What is at
And I

suggest* without substantial fear of contradiction, that the
lourfc of Appeals® exercise of these powers in the present case
Is unprecedented and is.qualitatively different from the past
exercises of supervisory power in decisions of this Court or
of other courts of appeal.
Now* the supervisory powers of the Federal courts must
be something more than a mere rubric to be invoked to justify
any action that the courts wish to take.

The fact that some

supervisory powers undeniably exist doss not* if I may borrow
the words of Justice Stevens in his dissent in the Telephone
Company case* "give Federal judges the wide-ranging powers of
an ombudsman."
Indeed* In the specific area of supervising police
and prosecutorial practices* this Court has specifically stated
that the Federal judiciary does not sit to exercise a chanceless
foot veto over law enforcement practices of which it does not
approve -- thatcs in the entrapment cases -- and last term in
Lovasco in talking about due process in a very related context
the Court saids "Judges are not free in defining due process to
Impose on law enforcement officials our personal and private

21

notions of fairness and to disregard the limits that bind judges
in their judicial functionsc"
QUESTION:

But that was in defining due process which

is a constitutional standard.

Isn’t -•» to echo my brother

Relinquish “s question -=> supervisory power to reverse the judgment of conviction is no more than the power, of any reviewing
court to reverse the judgment of conviction which it finds for
one reason or another erroneous on some basis other than the
Constitution or a statute.
Is there anything wrong* for example* with a particular
court of appeals in a particular circuit saying* "In this circuit
we are not going to approve the Allen charge to the jury."
MR. FREY:

No.

QUESTION: "It is nit constitutionally required to
disapprove it* but w@ are not* as a matter of X circuit law,
going to have Alien charges in this circuit."
MR. FREY:
am trying to make.

I think that's precisely the point that I
I don’t question that that power exists.

I think all of the cases in which supervisory poxver has been
exercised can be divided into two categories.

The first cate­

gory, which encompasses the vast majority of cases* includes
matters such an the proper voir dire of jurors* steps to be
taken to avoid prejudicial publicity* proper jury instructions*
such as the

charge. The legitimacy of these powers is

beyond question* but they are far removed in kind.

They are

22
supervision of the trial itself, of what goes on in the trial
and the court does not need a statute or a constitutional pro»
vision in order to exercise that kind of supervision.

That is

far removed from what the Court of Appeals was doing in this
case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Frey, I assume you are going to draw

the line between out of court and in court.
MR. FREY:

I am.

QUESTION:

Where are you going to put the grand jury?

MR. FREY:

Well, let me pass on to that.

I hava; very

little time left, so I just want to say that I -chink the McMabb
and Elkins cases are different from the Allan charge cases.
They come closer but the point I wanted to make cioout those was
that the Court has never exercised its supervisory power without
finding a violation of the defendant's rights In the McMabb~
Elkins kind of case.
Let me respond to your point.
significant respects an arm of the court.

The grand jury is in
Federal courts have

a legitimate and substantial interest in overseeing grand jury
proceedings.

Now, we think they have to be circumspect about

keeping a line between what ie intruding on Executive Branch
functions and what is proper judicial functions, but it is not
necessary to our argument today to say that the courts don't
have supervisory power to promulgate a rule to give target
warnings in the grand jury.

In other words, we can concede that

the courts could adopt such a rule.

They could say* henceforth*

are prospects of rules.

But these

They are not a retrospective reaching

out on a selective ad hoc basis to pick a single past instance
of a practice which the court had never indicated before was
inappropriate and imposing a sanction of suppression.
The question* Mr. Justice Marshall* Is remedy.

It is

not the power to make the rule* it is the power to impose the
particular remedy which the court selected in this case of sup­
pression .
And I might say that we are dealing here with standards
Of conduct for prosecutors.

In Mapp v. Ohio* the court ‘f ound

itself confronted with policemen over whom it had very little
power* with respect to whom it had very little ability to dis­
cipline them and it was in a sense compelled* if it was going
to do anything about what it viewed as a rash of otherwise
uncontrollable Fourth Amendment violations* to use a remedy of
evidentiary exclusion.
Here we are dealing with prosecutors.

There is no

reason to suppose that they won't obey a rule that's announced
by the courts and there is no reason to suppose that there are
isolated instances of disobedience* that it isn't sufficient to
deal with them by disciplining the disobedient lawyer directly

24

rather than —
QUESTION:

Mr. Frey# of course# you are dealing with

Strike; Force prosecutors coming into the district not these
who are regularly before the court, aren't you?

Isn't that a

special problem for the circuit?
MR. FREY:

I am reluctant to encourage the Court to

get into the matter of allocating functions between Strike Force
and U.So Attorneys# because I think that really is principally
the job of the Department of Justice.

But if it were to see fit

to do so# it has the power of contempt over these people# if
they come in.

It seems to me# it has the same control as over

any lawyer who appears before them.
QUESTION:

And hasn't that type of power tradition­

ally# in most cases# been exercised prospectively?
MR. FREY:
po*wer.

Oh# yes.

I think — Well# not the contempt

It requires an order which is violated.
QUESTION:

I am talking abcufc power over a practice

which the court disapproves and says# "Hereafter# the United
States Attorney will do thus and so."
MR. FREY:

I think that's precisely so.

QUESTION:

Do yon know of any case where a Federal

judge held the U.S. Attorney in contempt?
MR. FREY:

Chajndl.gr did that in Oklahoma.

QUESTION:

God# what happened to him?

MR. FREY:

‘We got It overturned pretty rapidly.

25

QUESTION:

And another judge held the present Judge

Timbers in contempt, before he was a judge.
MR. PREY:

But I think before you go to what is

clearly a drastic remedy of taking a defendant who has committed
an offense, serious offense of perjury in this case and, in
effect, pardoning that defendant as a means of disciplining the
U„S. Attorney, I think you have to be persuaded that that really

QUESTION:

I am afraid this might not have been the

right case.
QUESTION:

Let's try one other example.

We had some

case in the Seventh Circuit where there was a claim made that
the Government had abused its immunity powers, granted immunity In
much too liberal terms to get a witness to testify against an
accomplice.

Supposing the court were persuaded that the immunity

was almost like a bribe and that it made the witnesses * testi­
mony so inherently Incredible that it should be suppressed,
would the court have power to do that, do you think?
MR. FREY:

I think Rule 402 would say not, but if you

take the bong-go 0 situation, x was thinking about, where Judge
Wyzanski disapproved of the consultation between the U.S, Attorney
and the witness, I don't think he would have the power to say,
"Well, I am not going to let you put on that witness."
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr, Seldmen*

Thank you, Mr. Prey.

ORAL ARGUMENT OP IRVING P. SEIDMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE RESPONDENT
MR, SEXDMAN:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I appreciate the fact that we are here a second time,
but I respectfully submit to the Court that Mr. Frey has used
his first argument on the second occasion.
QUESTION:

Has anything changed since then?

MR. SEIDMAN:

I would have hoped that he would have

considered my argument more fully, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Do you really mean that you appreciate the

fact that you are here a second time?
MR. SEIDMAN:

For a humble lawyer, it is always an

honor to appear before the Supreme Court of the United State,
Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. SEIDMAN:

We will accept that.

Mr. Frey has most reasonably stated the

underlying factual pattern in this case, except that I would
wish to Inform the Court that the defendant in this matter is
a housewife who had part-time employment.

And, for whatever it

is worth, my law firm represents this defendant with respect to
the appellate part of this case in a pro bcno public help
position.

I think that's important to Indicate that this

defendant doesn’t appear here represented by a high-priced
attorney, nor is she a seasoned witness represented by counsel

27

when she appeared before the grand jury,
QUESTION:

When the charge Is perjury on a specific

day and hour before a grand jury* how are any of those factors
relevant?
MR, SEIDMAN:
background# Your Honor.

I just mention it to the Court for
I wish to get into the case as to the

law,
However# whether it is from the standpoint of the legal
issues or the philosophy underlying the legal issues# I believe
that the thrust of the argument by Mr. Prey has failed to address
the problem.
I do not believe this case involves an Instance where
the appellate court seeks to direct the prosecutor in what he
must or must not say.

And I believe the underlying opinion of

the Court of Appeals expressly states that if the prosecutor
wishes or the Attorney General wishes they need not# as the law
is presently constituted# give any type of target warning.
And# as time lias indicated# the Attorney General of
the United States has deemed it appropriate to adopt the require­
ment of target warnings as a uniform practice outside the scope
of constitutional and statutory requirements in the United States
of America# effective# I believe# February 15.* 1973# or there­
abouts .
I believe what the Court of Appeals was concerned
about# and what I was initially concerned about as defense

28

counsel in this matter, who brings approximately 10 years as a
prosecutor as a background to this type of case, was the conduct
that would be taking place before an am of the court, to whit,
a grand jury.
I submit to the Court that this is not an issue of an
appellate court seeking to exercise its chanceless veto cf
Executive Branch practice,

I submit to the Court that since the

Court's constitutional rulings in Mamdujano and its progeny,
that absent the exercise of supervisory power over grand juries
by appellate and district courts, this Court has left bare the
protection and requirements inherent in the exercise of equal
and fair justice, any concept of protection to any witness who
appears before the grand jury.

For the Court, has clearly stated

that there is no requirement for Miranda warning, target warning
of any type in that type of setting,
I believe what the court was concerned about and is
concerned with and properly concerned with is the grand jury
which is an arm of the court and not the Executive Branch cf
Government,
And, again, I wish to reiterate that the court in its
second opinion, as well as its first opinion, indicated that the
prosecutor could adopt any policy concerning this matter.
The question really is. Your Honor, whether or not
any witness who appears before a grand jury should expect uniform
application, from the standpoint of fairness and from the

29

standpoint of what Is the accepted practice within that circuit
which is an urban circuit* consisting of six different districts*
or whether or not the application of practice -QUESTION:

Wait a minute* you've got six

MR. SEIDMAN;
QUESTION:

Six districts.

Well* two of those in New York are not

urban* the Western and the Northern.

The Northern is consisting

of six penitentiaries* for the most part.

And Vermont is not

urban.
MR. SEIDMAN:

I stand corrected* Your Honor* to the

extend that that geographic and population finding is correct.
However* the entire district and the workload of the Second
Circuit certainly is a most responsible one.

And I believe what

the court was seeking to do is not retrospectively* but rather
prospectively and currently dealing with a situation which it
faced in that circuit.

And as is cited in our brief* the

Second Circuit had previously admonished and warned the Strike
Force attorneys appearing before it and in its circuit in the
Persico case that they had an obligation to identify with*
become informed with and follow the guidelines* not only of
their work in the circuit* but their requirement that they
operate with and in conjunction with and under the direction of
the United States Attorney in the particular district involved.
For Mr. Frey to suggest that this was a retrospective
application* is incorrect* in view of the Persico case where the

30

court not only issued a formal opinion but annexed thereto a
copy of the appropriate guidelines that were involved»
I submit to the Court that there is probably no more

important aspect of the criminal justice process than the grand
jury, because it is before the grand jury that supposedly the
determination is made -whether one becomes a defendant or is
determined not to be formally charged,
QUESTION:

Do you mean to suggest that most of the

people who are charged do go before a grand jury?
MR. SEIDMAN: c Well, ultimately, in the process, in
the Federal process, 1 would say that a good number, if not half
of the cases, are of grand jury origin, Your Honor, rather than
summary arrests situations.
QUESTION:

Yes, but the particular defendant, is the

particular defendant a witness before the grand jury in half
of the cases, or anywhere near half of the cases?
MR. SEIDMAN:

Well, in the Second Circuit, and particu­

larly in the Southern District and in the Eastern District of
that circuit, Your Honor, I believe it is the practice, and was
the practice, and this is what disturbed the court in this
instance.

After having given fair warning to the Strike Force

attorney, to notify defendants that there is a matter pending
before the grand jury and should they wish to appear before the
grand jury, although they are targeted, that they have that
right to do so.

And that is the accepted practice and,

31

apparently* that now is the accepted practice in the United
States of America* pursuant to the guidelines now issued by
fche Attorney General of the United States.
I might further submit to the Court that the issue of
sanction in this case really does not present any problem unless

me determines that this Court does not have the inherent power
fco supervise the conduct of prosecutors before an arm of the
court* which is the grand jury.
QUESTION:

Does it have supervisory power to supervise

the conduct of judges?
MR. SEIDMAN:
QUESTION:

Within Its circuit?

Yes* Your Honor.

This Court have supervisory power over

judges?
MR. SEIDMAN:

I believe you do* sir.

there have been instances of its application.

And I believe
And I would

assume that that did not emanate out of any constitutional or
statutory scheme.

And as was cited in the dissenting opinion

of Mr. Justice Marshall in the remand portion of this case*
"this Court and the Chief Judge has acknowledged the existence
of the supervisory power and enumerated cases therein and has
acknowledged the effective and proper utilization of sanction
by way of suppression as a means of fulfilling that supervisory
power, *'

* SY­
QUEST ION :

According to the Solicitor General* under

the supervisory* or whatever power you have* fche Second Circuit

32

said what it said, the Attorney General has issued an order,
a manual to all the prosecutors, not only in the Eastern District,
not only in the Second Circuit, but all over the country.
you have accomplished what you wanted.

So

Now the only other thing

is whether.you turn loose a perjurer,
MR, SKIDMAN:

I submit that that is not the issue,

Mr. Justice Marshall.
QUESTION:

I thought that was the Government's position.

MR, KEJDMAN:

That may well be the Government's

position, but I think this Court, in its seasoned and reasoned
judgment, would see beyond myoptic approach to what's at foot
here.
What the Government really is seeking to state and
propose is that pursuant to Rule 402 that appellate courts do
not have the supervision, or even the district courts, as to what
evidence or what conduct goes before those areas that are within
its domain, which includes the trial court and the grand jury.
And I might submit to the Court that Rule 402, in its
wording, merely states that relevant evidence is admissible.
QUESTION:

Mr, Seldman, doesn't this Court have the

same sort of supervisory power over the Court of Appeals as the
Court of Appeals has over U.S, Attorneys of the District Court,
just by virtue of our power to grant certiorari?
MR. SEIDMAN:

There is no doubt in my mind that this

Court has supervisory power over the conduct of affairs of the

33
judiciary in the United States of America, which would include
the Second Circuit.
QUESTION:

In other words, if the Second Circuit

decides there Is going to he no more Allen charge* as my brother
Stewart gave an hypothesis to your colleague* Mr. Prey* and re­
verses a conviction* the Government can petition here and we*
in turn* would be called upon to decide whethei one Alien charge
was to be a matter of national uniformity or that it's up to
each circuit* but at any rate* we would have a right to review
the Second Circuit’s, determination?
MR. SEJDMAN:

I believe so* and I have not suggested

anything to the contrary.

However, the analogy of the Allen

charge and the diversity of practice within the circuit, and
the fact that that does exist, and the fact that this Court has
not chosen to apply a uniform standard, or universal standard,
here in the United States, if anything, buttresses my position
that the Second Circuit, with respect to its jurisdiction,
could certainly adopt a procedure or a concept of what should
take place before its grand juries that have reasonableness.
And nobody has contended that the suggestion that the require­
ment of a target warning be given is unreasonable.

And, if

anything, the fact that the Attorney General has adopted that
practice adds weight to the significance of this case and the
requirement in acknowledging the existence of the supervisory
power of the circuit court, when reasonably exercised,

And, in

34
•phis case, adoption by the Attorney General would show some type
of reasonableness as to the concept that supervisory power is
what is at issue here and not iihether or not my client who faces
prosecution on another aspect of this charge has, or has not,
committed perjury.
I don't stand before this Court to condone perjury
and it has never been my argument.

However, I don’t believe,

and the circuit court stated that this Court has adopted a rule
Dr principle of law that in any perjury indictment that, per se,
there is no concept of suppression or the sanction of suppression.
And, as a matter of fact, even in the Mandujanp case, which was
a plurality opinion, I believe that there was an acknovjledgment
that there might be some situations in which,even given a perjury,
that the sanction of supprassion would be applicable.
I might add that there has not been a trial of this
matter, and all that the indictment really is, hopefully, is an
allegation.

The posture of this case is one of accusation.

The

posture of this ease, after the consideration of the point of law
or principle of law Involved herein, is what took place before
that, grand jury, and xmether or not the circuit or the district
court could apply its supervisory power, which obviously was not
arbitrary or capricious, given the adoption of the same principle
of law by the Attorney General of the United States* And what
is at issue here is can this Court, or should this Court, in
essence, interfere with the reasoned judgment of a circuit court

35
that had previously warned prosecutors that given Strike Force
failure to adhere to certain standards, that it was giving them
fair warning that the next time it would apply sanctions.
I might add that if this Court interferes with this
supervisory application of circuit court power, then it would be
adopting the suggestion of Mr. Frey which I believe this Court
could not reasonably entertain.

There is no way that a circuit

court nor a defense counsel can supervise each and every prose­
cutor as to what he or she does. Just as it would be impossible
for this Court to supervise each and every judge within its
jurisdiction as to what he or she does.
And, therefore, the essence of the supervisory power
is to permit the court to guide, in general terns, the conduct
6f those who are responsible in the performance of their duties
within its jurisdiction.

In this instance, the jurisdiction is

not the Executive Branch of Government.
grand jury.

The jurisdiction is the

There is no argument and case lore and statute are

clear that the grand jury is an arm of the court.

That means

that it is created by the court, it Is supervised by the court,
the grand jury reports back to the court, and, if need be, the
prosecutor can be excluded from appearing before that arm of the
court.
For Mr. Frey to suggest that the grand jury, in some
way, is a part of the Executive Branch of the Government, 1
believe, is the sanction — is the cause of the sanction In this

36
QUESTION;

Mr» Frey did not say that.

the U,S. Attorney was.

He said that

He said, specifically* that the grand

jury was a part of the judicial system.
MR. SEH)MAN;

Well* I take that back* but it was my

impression that what he is saying is that the application of a
sanction in this case is an interference with the Executive
Branch of Government.
QUESTION:
warn the witness.

Well* the grand jury wasn't required to
The U.S. Attorney was required.

MR, 3EIDMAN:

However* just as what I say before this

Court —
QUESTION;

Because the grand Jury didn't know about

the rule,
MR. SEIDMAN:
QUESTION:

Well* that may be the weakness.

Well* you said you are a former U.S. Attorney*

so you know.
MR. SEIDMAN:

I am a former State prosecutor* but -«*

and I do understand what takes place before grand juries and I
would hope that this Court would reconsider some of its consti­
tutional rulings In this area* but this is not the time or place
to deal in this matter.
But* again* getting back to the point that I w&s seek­
ing to make* and that is that there is no way that a supervisory
uourt can exercise supervisory power unless* as a concomitant of
/

that power* it had an ability to apply sanction.

And I submit

37
to the Court that in this instance sanction that was imposed here*
which results in the dismissal of the perjuring indictment, re­
lated not to the perjury count* but rather to the conduct of the
prosecutor in failing to adhere to a prior written formal warning,
to Strike Force attorneys.
X would hope that the Court would not remove from the
circuit courts its wisdom in determining when it should apply
sanctions of this type.

I don't believe this Court should be

led to believe* as Mr. Frey seemed; to indicate, srsac there would
be a new onslaught of litigation in this matter* involving fail­
ure to comply with internal guidelines.
This circuit was clear in stating, that they were not
creating any general exclusionary rule* nor were they in any
way suggesting that in each and every time that, the prosecutor
failed to dot an "i,! or cross a "fc" that there, would be the
sanction of suppression and the failure of an indictment.
To the contrary* the court clearly stated that this
was an ad hoc* one-time* sanction, falling within its desire to
inform Strike Force attorneys that failure to apply to the
circuit court's practices before grand juries has to result in
this sanction.
QUESTIONS

That would mean, I take It* from your point

of view, that if the Attorney General* personally* went into
court* as at least newspaper accounts indicated he did last
/

wtem.,, in «ne case* or within the last two weeks, that, the local

38
rule and the local court of appeals can Instruct the Attorney
Genera] of the United States, personally, on hox*j he must function.
That’s the consequence of it, isn’t it?
MR, SEXDMAN:

Only as to how he can function as

he practices law before the grand jury arid before that court.
The court does not seek to tell the Attorney General who he
is to investigate, how he is —
QUESTION:

No, narrowing It down to the process that

we are talking about.

You are saying that the Third Circuit can

tell the Attorney General of the United States, when he person­
ally presents himself before a grand jury to present an important
case, how he is to do it,
MR, SEIDMAN:
Your Honor.

I believe that that's absolutely so,

And by that, I assume that the court is not telling
f

him what facts or hox^r to investigate, but within its concept of
fair play In the application of equal justice, as citizens of
the United States should expect to receive, 1 believe that the
court can, within that -- in that circuit so instruct him, sir.
And I don’t believe that that would in any way and does in any
way interfere with his exercise of his executive power.

There

are concepts or principles that fall within the sole and exclu­
sive province of the court.

And I’ve sought to state to the

Court that the conduct of the grand jury is, in the sense of
what It listens to and how witnesses are treated there, is some­
thing that should be and Is within the province of the court, and

39
not within the province of any particular prosecutor depending
cn hew ha wakes up in the morning and determines he is going to
treat a witness before that grand jury.
In closing* I submit to the Court that the suggestion
by Mr. Prey that the failure of the prosecutor in this case to
adhere to internal guidelines is not the sole and total issue
here.

The question really is whether or not the Second Circuit

can* from the standpoint of fairness and the expectation of equal
treatment by its citizens* require that once the Government has
chosen a line of approach* that singular or particular prose»

cutors not have their own personal precl el ic felons apply i^ith
respect to the application of that particular principle.
And* as Judge Friendly stated in the Estepa case*
which* again* was a recognition of the court's supervisory

j

power* also involving a perjury case* that he stated* "We had
hoped that with the clear earning we have given to prosecutors
and the assurances given by United States Attorneys* a reversal
for improper use of hearsay before the grand jury would not be
required."
Here* the Assistant United States Attorney* whether
wittingly or unwittingly — we prefer to think the latter —
clearly violated the first of fchdse provisos.

We cannot, with

proper respect to the discharge of our duties* content our­
selves with yet another admonition.

A reversal with instruc­

tions to dismiss the indictment may help to translate the

40
assurances of the United States Attorneys into the consistent
performance by their assistants.

I think* really* that is what

is at the heart of this particular case in a singular application
to the facts of this case.
And if the Court recognized the existence of such
supervisory power in Bate pa* I see no distinction between this
case and the Esteoa case.

The fact that the Attorney General

has adopted these new guidelines ivhich seem to adopt what was at
issue here* I believe* do not deal with the essence of this case*
and there should be an affirmance of the circuit court’s opinion
to sustain its authority to supervise the conduct of its affairs
before that court.
Mr, Frey* I would assume* or the Government* would
seek to inform this Court* "Well* what Mrs. Jacobs wanted* now
Mrs, Jacobs has gotten,"
this case.

But that really is not the issue in

The issue in this case is the power of the court*

che inherent power of the court* to supervise the conduct,
I won't keep the Court any longer* and I thank you
for your indulgence,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you* gentlemen-,

The case is submitted.
