MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Friedman, I think you may proceed whenever you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M» FRIEDMAN, ESQ.
ON BEH/iLF CF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it p.h'-'Rse

■the Court:
This case, which is here on s, writ of certlorsry to
the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, is a damage suit
seeking $32 million against various officials of the Depart­
ment of Agriculture, growing out of m administrativa
proceeding they conducted under the Commodity Exchange Act—
Q
coon.

Mr. Friedman, excuse me for interrupting you so

But yen nay it is a damage suit; growing out of an

administrativa proceeding.

Did the government ever question

tii® basis of the District Court's federal jurisdiction in this
case?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, Mr. Justice, because the posture

of this case was the complaint was filed and there vas a motion
to dismiss on the ground of immunity.
filed in this case yet.

There has been no answer

And all of those questions are opes,

under the decision of the Court of Appeals.

Our position is

that this case was properly dismissed at the outset.

4
Q

Does that not that put us in something ©f an

awkward position in that we are asked to rule on a defense on
the marits whan in fact there might bs no federal jurisdic­
tion?
MS, FRIEDMAN:

The core of the problem, Mr. Justice,

is the District Court dismissed this suit.

Anc. 'the Court of:

Appeals reversed the dismissal saying that, the itnmu. ity in
this case was not what the District Court held,

And, there­

fore, as the case now stands, it goes back to the District
Court to consider these other issues.

And we brought the

case her© because we thirk the threshold ruling on immunity
was erroneous.
Q

What if I ask you what the jurirdietior was?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

The jurisdiction was asserted under

a large number of different .sections in th® cos plaint.
Q

Do you think any of them is

MR. FRIEDMAN:

sustainable?

I am not certain of that.

them, it seems to me, are clearly not sustainable.

Sosa© of
There are

allegations of violations ©f constitutional rights, * claim of

Amendments.

There is a claim relating to th© federal

jurisdiction.
Q

In terms of just jurisdiction, not whether they

stated th® causa ©f action, is any ©£ them sustainable?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

'I suspect probably.

5

Q

You suspect probably?

MR, FRIEDMAN:

Yes.

I mean., it is in a sense

similar to many of these cases which are brought against
government, officials for damages based upon their actions
taken in performance of their duties.
Q

Sort of a Bivens type of suit?

MR, FRIEDMAN:

We suggest this is not the Bivens type

of suit because that in fact involved <a constitutional claim.
This? has some constitutional allegations but basically we
think this is comparabis to a suit for malicious prosecution
and defamation.

I think it is similar to the case that this

Court had before it in the companion to Barr, Howare v. Lyons,
where a suit was brought against—
Q

But that was diversity jurisdiction.

Q

You said, Mr, Friedman, you suspect that one

or more of theaa several that are cited may afford a basis
for jurisdiction.

Can you suggest one that you suspect?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

The only one that I could so© that

they rely on conceivably might bm with Section 1331, which is
the federal question jurisdiction.

I think you haw to stretch

that a bit to say that that is the kind of thing involved in
this case.

6

Q

That is a federal question type of suit too,

is it not?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

It is, yes.

But I was thinking in

terms of the claim of basically malicious prosecution and
defamation and so on growing out of the federal thing and
then the—
Q

What is the federal question in a cate like

that?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I suppose the federal question would

be whether these individuals had exceeded their authority in
conducting the administrative proceeding, which may be enough
to bring it in.

As I said, we have not focused on this

question, this issue, because this was not the case as we
saw it that came up to this Court from the Court of Appeals
decision.

Wo would be happy if the Court wishes to submit a

supplemental memorandum on this issue, if the Court deems it
desirable, because we have not frankly focused on it or
considered it.
Q

You mean in the motion to dismiss no one. ever

moved to dismiss for want, of jurisdiction?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

The only motion that was filed for

want of jurisdiction was with respect to the suit against the
Department of Agriculture and the commodity credit authority,
and that was on the ground it was brought by sovereign
immunity.

There was no motion made to dismiss for lack of

jurisdiction in the sense of 'the Court had not had its
jurisdiction pronerly invoked.
Q

I suspect? Mr. Friedman, that as the dialogue

continues, that may we 11 develop to be the case, an'", we will
firm that up at the end of the argument.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

If the Court wishes, we will of

course submit a memorandum on this topic.
The issue in the, case, as posed by the Court: of
Appeals decision, is whether these government officials who
conducted this administrative proceeding have absolute
immunity, as we contend, or a qualified immunity, as the
Court of Appeals held.

And the critical significance of that

distinction of course is that under absolute immunity the
issues are relatively narrow, whether the official is active
within the scope of his authority and whether the action was
discretionary.

Whereas under qualified immunity you get into

the whole problem of motive and intent, and this involves a
far more sweeping examination and the kind of thing that
normally cannot be disposed of summarily on either a motion to
dismiss or summary judgment*
The Commodity Exchange Act provides a comprehensive
regulatory system for the futures

commission

business.

And

under the act people who are so-called futures.commission
merchants are required to register with the Secretary of
Agriculture.

And the Secretary has promulgated a regulation

8

"that requires these individuals to meet certain minimum
capital balances and to file reports on their balances,

Tha

respondent, Mr, Economou and his corporation, were registered
with, tee Department of Agriculture as futures commission
merchants.

And te submitted one of these reports on his

minimum capital situation, and this raised some questions
within the Department of Agriculture over the correctness of
his report and whether in fact he was in compliance.

As a

result of this, an audit was directed of his boohs and records.
The audit was made, and eventually the Assistant Secretary of
Agriculture issued an administrative complaint, subsequently
amended and broadened, charging that Mr. Economou and his
corporation had -wilfully violated the minimum capital
regulations.
And, in accordance with the standard practice of
the Department of Agriculture, this complaint was made avail­
able in the Department's press room with a cover sheet that
stated exactly, summarized, what the complaint alleged and
pointed out that tee mere issuance of this complaint did not
constitute any adjudication of violation.
A hearing was held before a hearing examiner of the
Department, who found that Hr. Economou had committed these
wilful violations.

The hearing examiner proposed that

Mr. Economou*s registration be suspended for 90 days and that
for that period he be barred from any trading in the commodities

9
market.

Under the statute, the Secretary of Agriculture has

delegated to the judicial officer of the Department the
authority to hear appeals in such cases.

This matter was

appealed to the judicial officer who upheld the decision of
•the hearing examiner and imposed this punishment.
The Court of Appeals set aside this judicial order
or» tli© ground that the finding of wilfulness was erroneous.
Q

That was in a separate proceeding from this

one.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That was a separate proceeding.

This proceeding—this lawsuit began during' the time the case
was pending on appeal from the hearing examiner to the
judicial, officer.
began this case,

And it was at that point that Mr, Economou
It started as a suit to enjoin*

the Depart-

But coupled

t;o that complaint at the very end was a claim for $32 million
in damages.

And then «it a later stage in the proceeding the

complaint was amended to expand on the claims and also to add
another defendant, who was the judicial officer.
Q

This complaint was filed then while review was

either ponding or open administrative review in the Second
Circuits
MR. FRIEDMAN:
tice.

This was filed before -thatf Mr. Jus­

Let me gives tha chronology.

The hearing examiner had

decided the administrative proceeding adversely to Mr. Econemcm;

10

He had appealed from that: decision to the judicial officer,
and then while that appeal to the judicial officer was pend­
ing, before the judicial officer had heard argument in the
case, the present complaint was filed, seeking both to enjoin
further administrative proceedings and seeking the damages of
§32 million.,

After the injunction was denied by th

District

Court, then the case proceeded to decision before the judicial
officer.

Then the decision of the judicial officer was taken

to th© Second Circuit, and the Second Circuit reversed that
decision.

And in th© interim, the complaint was amended, as

I say, to expand somewhat, on the causes of action aid also to
bring in as a defendant the judicial officer who hac decided
the case against Mr. Economc-u.
Th© complaint named 12 individual defendants,
starting with the Secretary of Agriculture, the Assistant
Secretary who had issued th* complaint, the administrator of
th© Commodity Exchange Authority who directed the whole
proceeding and ordered the audit, the regional director in
New York under whose supervision the audit was conducted, three
auditors who had. gone in and audited his books, a mem named
Davis who was e.i lawyer in the general counsel's office of the.
Department of Agriculture, who had tried the case for the
government, the hearing examiner examiner who had initially
decided it, and the judicial officer who had affirmed th©
hearing officer’s decision.

il
The amended complaint said that by maliciously and
wrongfully instituting these proceedings against Mr. Economou
the people in the Department of Agriculture had triced to injure
his reputation and put him out of business, and the complaint
suggests that they did these things because he had been very
critical of the way these people were administering the act. '
More specifically he makes three claims.

He says,

first, the institution of the proceedings ware unauthorised
because the Department had not given him a warring letter
which they normally would do and thus afforded him the
opportunity to bring the mistakes into line to correct any
deficiencies.
Secondly, they said the Department had no authority
to issue a sanction of any sort because prior to the tiro the
sanction was issued, he had ceased operating as a futures
commi s s ion xner ch amt,
And, third, the defendants were charged with issuing
a defamatory pra~a release. which 1 assume has references to the
release of the complaint in the covering memorandum to the
press oflies.
*

Q

Where is that, in the appendix, if you have it

right at hand , Mr. Friedman?
MR. FEIEDMMS:
Q

The complaint, you mean?

?fc, the prase release.

MR. FtlJiDMAbfs

oh, the press release itself is not

12
set forth in the appendix , but the cover sheet to tu© press
release is set, forth at page) 150.

All that there was was

there was the cover sheet and the copy of the administrative
complaint.

The complaint was released to the press together

with this cover sheet which

is set forth at page 150„

hat me add one other thing.

The complaint set forth

ten different causes of action, four of which were asserted to

violate the respondent’s constitutional rights under she
Due Process Clause and his rights to free speech.

And, as I

have indicated, he sought damages of $32 million, which are
broken down into various segments, $6 million for this, $4
million for that, $800,000 for something else.
At the early stage of the proceedings, in opposing
his application for a stay ©f the administrative proceedings,
the defendants had filed an affidavit by the petition of

Mr. Davis, the lawyer cf the Agriculture Department, that set
forth in. detail the functions performed by each of the
individual defendants with respect to this case.

And, on tse

basis of that affidavit, the. defendant)? then moved t.o dis­
miss this suit on the ground it was barred by the doctrine of
official immunity.
The District Court so held and did dismiss it.

The

Court of Appeals reversedholding that while this Court’s
decision in Barr, if it had been the lost word on tl3 subject,
might wall induce thorn, as it had the District Court, to hold.

they thought that under the new cases a qualified is .annuity—
the good faith and reasonable ground tests suggested in

individuals.
As we see the case, there are two basic insues in
the case.

The first is whether the absolute immunity that

this Court recognized in Barr v. Mafcteo, is still a s ound
doctrine and, if so, whether -the more recent cases ruder

And, thssrafore, if y >u

14
people to make? these charges and fore® the respondent to
defend on the rear its, this is likely to inhibit all but the
most; fearless and all but the most vigorous from acting as
they should act because, as he said, "Again and again the public
interest calls for action, which may turn, out to be founded on
a mistake, in the face of which an official may later find
himself hard put to it to satisfy a jury of his good faith."
And he said, "So, it is often tbcase the answer must be
found in a balance between the evils inevitable in cither
alternative.

In this instance it has been thought 5a the end

batter to leave unredressed wrongs done by dishonest officers
than to subject those who try to do their duty to the constant
dread ©£ retaliation."
Q

Mr. Friedmanf in Barr did the Court indicate

that the absolute immunity it came up with there w Id apply to
actions outside the scope of authority?
HR. FRIEDMAN:

Oh, to.

Oh, no.

What they said was

it had to be within the outer perimeter.
Then how do you interpret that?
MR, FRIEDMAN:
Q

The outer perimeter of his authority?

Ha has to be doing the kind of thing, does he,

that h® is authorized to do under the statute?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
t.V'.l g, that it
Q

to b&

I would suppose it is the kind of
— t. :y connected—

that, if it te-ens out later that the Court

15
decides he had no authority whatsoever to clo it, he just made
a mistake?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

I think that is what it really was

intended to protect, Mr. Justice.
Q

Yes.

Sof it does not have to be within the

scop© of his authority?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

That it. was within the general scop®

of his authority.
Q

You mean the kind of thing he was authorised?

MR. FRIEDMAN;

That is right.

In this case, for

example, it was ultimately held by the Court of Appeals that
finding of wilfulness was erroneous.
Q

Whafc would you say if it had been decided in a

csss that an official had no authority to do a certain act
under a statuto and the next time he did it. anyway, knowing
that he had no such authority?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

Then I would think he was clearly

acting beyond his authority.
Q

Than, no absolute1, immunity and no immunity at

all?
MR. FRIEDMAN i

I would think not.

I would think-

that because if he is acting boyond his authority, h© d ya r. ot
have any immunity at all.

Or if ha is acting patently beyond

his authority.
Q

What if a complaint allrgoa that h© injured

16

this person knowing that ha h,?,d no authority under the statute
to act as he did?
MR, FRIEDMAN;
that he said knowingly,

I think it is not the allegation
I think the question is whether in

fact what h® was doing was within his assigned duty.
Q•

The allegation is that he did it maliciously

in the sense he knew he was acting beyond the scope of his
authority.
MR. FRIEDMAN;

I do not think that is; enough,

Mr. Justice,
Q

In that case then, where he alleges it was held

last year that he had no such authority'and yet he did it
anyway knowing that he did net,

you say say that ho could

stand in court on that?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, I think that is a different case

where it has batKi hold, that he does not have authority.

MU. FRIEDMAN:

And it, was a close questiot whether

this particular official had the authority to issue press
releases.
Q

If you apply Learned Hand’s test, though, do you

not come out with a somewhat different answer to my Brother
White’s question because, as you say, it is alleged in all
these cases that he knew he did not have the authority?

And

I would think that the teaching of Learned Hand in Gregoire v.
Biddle is that that is something you ought not to have to try
out every time.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I would say except for the one case

that Justice White posed, where it had been previously held
that he does not have the authority.
Q

Previously held by whom?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I assume from Justice White's question

that it was held by the courts.
Q

This Court?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Presumably by a court whose ruling

the official would feel obliged to observe.
I mean, we do know that there ear© instances in which
officials of the government seek to obtain a conflict among
the circuits so that they dc not consider themselves bound by
a particular court.
Let p.;s( if I may, turn to the facts of this cgsg to
see what 'this charges involves, and I redd likes to ; how why

18
the importance of absolute immunity in this situation.
The affidavits show that everything that the
defendants did in this case—all their actions were taken as
part of their duties in enforcing this statute.

Under the

statute the Secretary is directed to investigate—when an
investigation was appropriate—to see whether in fa :t there
were violations of the minimum capital requirements

Once it

appeared that there was n violation, they were justified in
issuing a complaint,

once the complaint was issued, Mr. Davis

had assigned to him the trial of this case as part of his
duties.

The hearing examiner's sols connection with this case

is deciding the case on the record before* him, as that was the
function performed by the judicial officer.
According to Mr. Economou, in a lengthy affidavit
that he filed in this case, all of this was a plot against him.
I would just like to refer the Court to page 29 of the appen­
dix where Mr. Economous says in this affidavit*

"Tie action

undertaken by the CEA"—Commodity Exchange Authority--”in
their Docket No. 167 and the various acts of officials and
employees in connection therewith are in actuality an organised
conspiracy for the specific purpose of discrediting me in the
financial community and with the investing public and through
me to cause the downfall and destruction of the American Botrd
of Trade Sue., a new exchange and marketplace.”

That wus mi

19
Q

Mr. Fricdr.t3ii, m&:/ I ask a question hare.

Bo

you suggest that we look at each of the defendants separately?
Some of the defendants, you did not. quite get to were- auditors
rather than the higher ranking people.

In some areas there

is a distinction between the position of a prosecutor, say,
and a police officer.

One gets absolute immunity.

gets qualified immunity.

The othur

Do you think that distinction might,

apply to tha difference between an auditor and a herring
examiner, for example, or a lawyer trying the case?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

w© think that tha auditors in this

case were really performing factors which involved considerable
discussion because in conducting an audit you have to decide
what you are going to lock at, how intensively you ere going
t go into it, how much you {fra going to question these people.
And ©nee again it seems to us the threat of possible, suit with
these enormous damages being sought here, this is enough to
deter the auditor from perhaps being as vigilant as he might
be.

Obviously,

its farther down the line you go, tha lessor

the discretion involved.

And at sera point it ceases to bn

ci'ioret'ionury at all, of cev.csa.

But we think there

is or svgh

Issra, in tori’" of the auditors, that they did have enough

discretion to rake this on appropriate—

MR» FRIEDMAN:
case.

I think it might vary from case to

But I think that it would be more lik® the auditors

in this case.
Let me just come to one other aspect, ©f this.

All

of these people are basically conducting an investigatory
proceeding, a disciplinary proceedingf to determine whether
some sanctions should be imposed upon the respondent.

And I

suggest that, for instance, if there is a danger that at some
later point these officials are going to have to try to
justify to a jury what they did in ah; face of these charges
of a conspiracy -—and of course, it is colored, by the claim that
they w©re after him because is had bean critical of the way
they were administering the act'—if they had to justify this,
it seems not

son able to

conclude that in c close case

they may shade their decision.
Q

Mr. Friedman, does it make, any difference in

your argument. that

h^r© khe.ro was an Administrative review

proceeding open to the respondent

after these government

officials had perferirusd their tasks in which he could challt ig&

21
MR. FRIEDMAN:

This is ©ns-, of the factors, the point

that you do not have to subject government officials to
personal liability in order to correct errors, if ary, that rav
have been committed.

Here if everything he says about this

proceeding it is true, it has been corrected because, of the
reversal of the decision against him.
His damages, hia injuries, have not bsen

MR. FRIEDMAN:

His injuries of course have not been

But again we came back, it seems to me, to the

basic policy underlying ths immunity, which this Court has
recognized in Barr and which Learned Hand recognized, that it
has been considered better that there may be occasional
instances in which semi-body who hnc a just claim will be c’snisd
it.

But that is outweighed by ths importance in the public

interest of making sure that government officials are not
d?-.'.v';rrcc from

vigorously and fearlessly becau.m of the

thr- ;av of possible private, liability.
Q

Mr. Friedman, -now that I have interrupted you,

may I ask you a couple of other questions?
the ano-'or to my first one is self-evident.

I think perhaps
And the question

is. Who defends' federal officials when they nr® sued in cases
like this?

And I suppose the answer is,' by your presence here,
mt of the United States does.

MR.

fryedman:

'Th-ri: is correct, with -one or two

22

possible exceptions .

There may be situations where we see

something of a conflict of interest among all the defendants,
in which case wa will avoid this conflict by furnishing the
funds for them to retain outside counsel or, secondly, where
a charge in a suit like this suggests the possibility of some
criminal violation.

Of course if the Department might

ultimately be prosecuting some of these people, we do not
attempt to defend them in civil liability.

In that situ&ti

once again we do provide them with outside counsel.

We pay

for the outside counsel.
Q

So, this is dene at government expense, by tie

government or at government expense.

If there were no

immunity and there were a judgment against the officials,
based upon malicious action, who would pay the government?
MR. PRIEDM1K:

Ordinarily the official would have to

pay it out of his own pocket.

-Unless there is some statute

fically authorising

payment of such a judgment, the

funds ordinarily to pay to those judgment; .

Conorivjibly in pome situations Congress might enact a priva U-;
bill to pay for it.
hiss own pocket.

But normally the official pays it out cf

It is ~censing out of thfeir own pocket.

A man

may have his lifetime savings wiped out if a jury several
years later should conclude that, what had seemed to him at
the time to bs a reasonable action in fact was not taken in
good faith.

That is the thing, it seems to me, that is the

23
the most serious and fcofheroeme and dangerous -about this thing»
Q

Then

as a general rule there would bo no

indsranif i cation—
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Normally there would not.

--by the government employer.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I might add that the Attorney General

has just recently proposed legislation under which these suits
would b© channeled away from the individual defendant to the
United States, to amend the Tort Claims Act to permit this
type of suit to be brought under the Tort Claims Act.

That

legislation has just recently bean recommended because of

concern that something' should be done to rectify tha
situation where individuals have suffered damages as., r. result
of government action.

But it seems to us that that is a

very different tiling from subjecting the individuals person­
ally to liability for wlmt. they have done in the course of
their official duties.
Q

l taka it you think that would met vho

problems that Judge Learned Hand was raising in the Biddle
case.

caooc that 1:1-3 Court bus

24
decided in Scheuar v. Rhodes, Wood v. Strickland, under
Section 1583.

W® think that those cases do not- announce any

modification of the salutory principle recognized ir Barr /7.
Mafcfceo.

We think those cases turn on the fact that in

Section 1983, Congress provided a remedy against sti.t®
officials for persons whose constitutional rights hi .d been
denied them by those officials under color of law.

And as

this Court has recognised several times, it would really
vitiate that section, would rob it of its effectiveness, if
because of the existence of absolute immunity, those officials
could not be held responsible for the conduct they had
committed.
Indeed, this Court has recognized that one of the
things that Congress Intended to do under .19 83 was •
remedy for people against state officials who had under the:" r
state authorities done these things.

MR. FRIEDMAN-!

I am not sure.

kind of the converse of it.

it is

in the on© case it is batter tnat

a hundred guilty go free than one innocent go to' jail.

Hero

it is that it is better that an occasional one not be able to
recover than that the hundred government officials be
deterred from acting vigorously I think.
Q

But, Mr. Friedman, how about the investigator

for any one of the. government agencies acting within the
scope of his authority as you understand it to, for example r
make arrests without warrants or in unusual circumstances
making searches without warrants?

He just happens to make a

mistake.

MR. FRIEDMANs

It seems to ms the investi rater

brings up a different problem which is—

He is a government official.

MR. FRIEDMAN!

He has si grant deal of discretion.

the federal investigators, 1 thought you indicated.
HR, FRIEDMAN:

Yes, but also it is a common law—a

common law traditionally—police officers have had in effect
a qualified immunity.
Q

It has been tradition for—

Is there not some line somewhere in the

federal hierarchy that there is no absolute immunity?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

At some lower level.

The discretion

that a police officer exorcises in deciding whether or not to
arrest someone or whether to break down a door or—
Q

Pretty broad discretion.

MR. FRIEDMAN;

It involves discretion but possibly

not the kind of policy discretion that: the immunity principle
is designed to further.

That is, it has been said in some

courts that a fair test of whether or not this is discretion—
Is this the kind of action by the government official which
the possibility of substantial personal liability
to deter him from taking?

is likely

That is the kind of thing.

And polios for canturies have been acting vigorously
ond they all know that if they exceed their authority, they
are sued for false arrest.
Q

And they may all have savings.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

They may.

They may.

But vhis I think

is a special case.
■

As vp, p&ggoet ip ©or bri©.:!, this Court dees z-.ot have to

because we think whatever may he those limits., cert -.inly si7

of these individuals, with what they did in this ca.e,

their duties.
Q

Mr» Friedman, you have relied almost

exclusively on Barr v, Matfcco.

There is on© other class

of

government officials who.- it has bean established, have
absolute. immunity from civil liability, and that is prose­
cutors .
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Yes.

Do you think there is a sufficient analogy

between at least some of these defendants and prosecutors to
bring them undsr the umbrella, of that doctrine?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

T/7e have suggested that, Mr... Justice.

Certainly with respect to Mr. Davis, the lawyer who triad the
case at the administrative level, his function is basically
■that of a prosecutor.

As id tfc.a auditors, by the way, in

addition to conducting the- audit, also testified as witnesses
and witnesses traditionally have irrnrrssty—and sics parti.":!

Mr. Buxfo&um.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C, BUXBAUM, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. BUXBAUM:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please fcho

Court:
The factual circumstances surrounding thin: case are
very important.

I should point out that tills case was

decided on the district level on a motion to dismiss.
was no discovery in this case,

There

There were no affidavits

attached to the motion to dismiss.

And we must therefore

regard the allegations in the complaint as being true.
The factual circumstances are these.

Mr. Econctoou

had long been in the commodities business sis a member of one
of the more established exchanges in Chicago.

He, through

the y&s-TSf had come to acme conclusions about the way the
commodities business in his particular area was being run,
and he found, he felt, that there war® substantial problems
with the commodities industry and with the regulatory agencies
that werQ regulating it.

At that times tha regulatory agency

was tha Commodity Exchange Authority, which was & portion of
the Departsnent of Agriculture.
He? mad® known—very well kn&m-—his. coraplrlnts about
both the Commodity Exchange Authority »-.nd about the Industry

32
itself.

Ke hat off on his own, leaving the Chicago mercantile

*
position 'that ha had, and established his own exchange,
registering an offering with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, registering some other trading organisations with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, preparing to register
his exchange, dr . the exchange known as -the American Board
of Trade, with the SEC, and do a number of.other things.

He

formed an organization which hs was installed as the. president
of called the American Association of Commodity Tracers, I
believe.

And this was designed to change tfco concepts whicl

existed in the coramcd£ties business at the time.
People*--and this is §11 registered in the complaint
and also in this affidavit which is the first part of the
appendix—people in the industry and people who were regulating
the industry too umbrage at this particular activity of
Mr. Economou.
It so happens that Mr, Economou is net thi only
person—
Q

How do you know they did?

MR. BOXBAUMi

How do wa know they did?

One of the

reasons we know they did is because of the action' they took
against him in this particular case.
Q

You do not know their actions were taken for

that reason.

MR. B'f.?x.BAUMs

Wa certainly alleged it, and it waist fee

33

d®CHTisd. as true for the purposes of this particular argument,.
Q

That is as far as you know„ is that it is

allaged?
MR. BUXBAUM;

We believe v?e have more evidence than

that.
Q

And we must take that as true.

MR. BUXBAUM:
Q

That is your point.

MR. BUXBAUM:
Q

Yes, I would think so.

That is my point.

If there is jurisdiction.

MR. BUXBAUM:

Always if there is jurisdiction.

In any event, as I gay, these matters v/sro published
as a matter of record.

pointing at the Commodity Exchange Authority and the way the
coaeiodities business was being regulated.

case, they dismissed it,

froudns for dismissal also»

But they said since it did not

meet the test of wilfulness, a threshold test, therefore the
entire matter was dismissed.
In this hearings that were held, by the way, in the
administrative hearings that were held below, the petitioners
admitted that if they had informed Mr. Ecenomou of the fact
that they wer© going to com© down with this particular allega­
tion, that he would have in all likelihood corrected it, and
therefore there would have been no need to proceed.
"a addition, it. was admitted irs one? of the r.dr.inistre.tiv© hearings that tie statement that the business was.
losing capital at the rata of $4,000 a month was erroneous.
It was an erroneous statement, a very substantial and harmful
erroneous statement.

If they had to g© in court every timo they made

But, I mean—[laughter]—some

other people have problems.
MR. BUXBAUMs

I would say this, that I think it is

beyond peradventure that most federal officials would have
the reasonable, good-faith immunity, the limited immunity of
reasonable good faith, so that even if they'were wrong, if
they behave reasonably and in good faith, they would be immune
from suit.

N© one is denying them -that immunity.

MR. BUXBAUM:

When you say a motion for summary

Right.

MR. BUXBAUf-1:

If the petitioners demanded to say,

"You claim that this was a conspiracy to deprive your client
cf his constitutional right to free speech and to take his
property without due process of lav/"—you cannot just rely upon
assertions in a complaint..

At that particular point, as a

minimum, it would bo our responsibility to come forth with
some evidence.

And, if not, the Court would certainly--and

so if it was a frivolous claim—
Q

That does not. go to the defense at all.

goes to your ability to sustain against a motion feu summery

MR. BUXRAUMs

It seems to me that the way the

immunity law now exists—first of all, I do net believe we
should create what jurists call a new class.

I do not believe

that federal officials should be different from anyone els®
in society.
I think that there are important decisions of this
Court recently -that indicate that everyone in 'die United
States is subject to the law of the United States.

And I

think these are matters that should bs and must be accorded
due respect.

I do not think that is the proper

reading of Barr v. Matteo.

I think what it doss say is that

full immunity, total immunity, is not only to be granted to
highest ranking federal officials, not only members of
cabinet rank, but it can also bo granted to other officials
in policy-making positions who need such immunity so that when
they make policy, they can clearly in this discretionary area
make policy free from belated quarterbacks second-guessing
them as to the policy they made.

You do not see any difference between Bivens

Do you think they are different?

I do think they are different, yes,

That is right.

You had them together so fast.

Gregoire v. Biddle is still good law, is it rot?

Wa have in our brief before the Court raised that issue..

And I wish.to point to a cacent decision that is referred tc b
the petitioners in this particular case where—in Expedition j
Unlimit::.! y. Smithsonian ■■•~whcw: in Judge Wilkey*s concurring
opinion he states that- there is some serious question if they

49
had to review the issue ab initio as to whether or not the
Smithsonian, which we regard as a federal institution, was
amenable, that under those circumstances he would have to
reconsider the whole matter in view of the legislative history.
And it has been said that historically the concept of
sovereign immunity which had bean recognized by this Court
and by others was something that should not have been made part
of our heritage from our English brethren in the sense that?
as some of the earlier case- have said, the people were
presumably sovereign in the United States of America, there
was no sovereign, and there was no sovereign to grant a
petition of right and as such it was error from the incepti :-n
to grant sovereign immunity to the federal gov€>rnmert.
has been said.

That

X realize that, in the view of all that has

gone since the initial time to today it is a difficult argu­
ment to sustain.

But 1 think there is something to be said

for considering that particular argument.
I think that it is interesting in the Expeditions
Unlimited case it makes reference to the Economou case, and
it finds the Second Circuit decision not in accord with its
feeling.

However, if the separate opinions are; read, I think

the separate opinions, the concurring opinions, indj cate -diet
thars is very serious doubt in the minds of. at least three cf
the justices in the District Court of Columbia as to whether
or not Barr v. Hatfceo has the same vigor as it did in view of

50

the decision in Schauer i% Rhodos.

It is our feeling, at any

rate, that Barr v. Matt-ao dess not grant immunity to all
federal officials irrespective of their positions and their
activities but only to those having policy-making positions
and acting within the scope of their authority-

It seems to ms

that others are very well protected by a good-faith

reasonable

defense to suit.
I want to point out that individuals in commerce—
Q

Counsel, it has been suggested

you before

that doss not protect them from being sued.
MR. BUXBAUM:
Q

Mo, it does not.

which is what Judge Hand was concerned about

and what the Biddle case was concerned about, the being
exposed to jeopardy in a civil sens®.
MR. BUXBAUM:

That is a serious problem, Your Honor.

And yet people in private life, in private industry.. ar.e
subject to suit, and it does not prevent them from acting
vigorously in corporate activity.

Outside directors of

corporations have been subject to more vigorous suit.
Questions of disclosure
havo been raised to a new level by
9
the Securities and Exchange Commission among corporate
officers, and corporate officers ar© subject to greater
scrutiny.

People in the commodities end securities business—

not only are they subject to suit individually under 10(b) CD
for their own wrongdoing but for failure to supervise under the

51
New York Stock Exchange laws and under the laws of NASD*
Private individuals and private industry are subject to suit#
v

and they seem to be able to vigorously carry out thDir
activities.

Why not federal officials?

Why should they be

any less subject to suit, provided that they are given a
good-faith, reasonable immunity so that when they at in
good faith and reasonably they will not ba subject to
harassing suits?
It seems to me that there should be «. bale.nee
between th® private world and the public world of government.
I think in view of the broadening responsibilities of private
individuals in business that government and federal officials
will act wrongfully.

And I might, point out that there has

been a tremendous growth of federal bureaucracy, if you warn,
to use that word, and other government? and there is a f©tiling
among—it is alleged there is a feeling among people that
they have lost control ovar these bur©suerstic ' institutions.
They do not knew how to relato to them.

And if they feel they

are wrong and that hh©y have a right to suit, it seems to me
it would help to bring the concept of legitimae/ to ;j©v©rr,ment.
Q

If a private individual is deterred from acting

by the threat of a suit, he is only deterred in purs tit of his

own private interests, whereas if at government official is
dst®rrect from enforcing soma governmental policy, he is
conceivably deterred from acting in a way that would benefit a

great number of people.
BUXBAUM:

That is true, except, most or those

allegations, where there are suits against federal officials,
are allegations that the official is acting in a private and
narrow way rather fchah in a public way.

That is th
