ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN A. WEIS.:,, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF' OF THE PETITIONER
MRc WEISES

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the C ourfc:
This case involves the exclusion of all noncitizens
from all jobs in the New York State Police Department, as
troopers, etcetera.

By such exclusion, various constitutional

precepts are violated.

First, there is the group at considera­

Allens have been considered by this Court, and

justly so, a discreet insular minority.

They are, on the one

hand, vulnerable because of their peculiar status, other hand,
they contribute by their presence here to the country.
QUESTION:

Who were the constituents in the discreet

insular minority that Justice Stone referred to?
MR. WEILS:

In that case, they were not aliens-.

They were — You are talking about Footnote 4. i take it.
It was any group that could be classified, particularly, as
having discreet characteristics«

It was a generic classifi­

In this case, we have what has been characterized by

this Court as an example of that minority.
QUESTION:

In fact, what were they in Justice Stoners

MR. WliISS :

QU1STI4N:

And X think the footnote was kind of not

necessary, perhaps, to the decision in that case.
MR. WJEIaS :

I agree, Your Honor.

And I wasn't

relying upon Footnote Number 4 of Caroline Products, but
rather a description ~~

Which refers back to that

That is the reference we

I am aware of the dispute as to whether that is an

appropriate reference back, but that is the law concerning
aliens.

These are, of course, individuals who have undergone

federal scrutiny and are here pursuant to federal statute.
QUrcTIJN:

Do you think there is a difference

between a discreet insular group, whether minority or other®
wise, when they are, let us say, American Indians o ■ Negroes
or women or man who cannot change their condition?
one kind of a discreet insular group,

That's

-Do you think aliens

fit Into that kind of a definition of the group?

5
MR* ViiJ'.vS :

They can and they cannot *

is when is that distinction important*

The question

In this case, for

example, some of the aliens cannot change their status for
the purpose of this case and rid themselves of the exclusion­
ary burden.

There are others who, perhaps, could*

So, for

the purpose of this case, that is not* a functional distinction,
but it could be a distinction that could come into play in
other cases,
QUKoTION:

As I understand the record, a Mrt Foley

could not become a citizen in time to meet the age require-.
ment *
MR* WKJlhS :

That's correct, Your Honor*

And,

therefore, this is a status which he, and others like him,
are not able to change*

There may be other individuals

because the category is so broad that could, in fact, change
their status and they, too, would fall under this rubric,
but that distinction cannot be made for the purpose of this
case *

It might be made for different statutes in different

considerations at different times*
I think it is also important to note what is at
stake here, what right we are talking about excluding these
noncitizens from*
QUESTION:

Mr* Weiss, could I ask one question.

Your client could not change his status in time to quality,
but this is a class action, is it not?

6
MRo WEXsS:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
Is the class limited to plaintiffs who

could not change their status because of the age qualification,
or does it apply to ail aliens?
MR, .WEJS3:

It applies to all aliens, Your Honor,

because that is how the statute sweeps and that includes those
two, possibly distinguishable subclasses, those who can and
those who cannot.
The right at stake here is employment.

This Court

has consistently held, particularly in conjunction with alien
rights, that employment is a crucial right.

In particular,

this is employment in a police department.

Whatever reasons

may be evoked to justify such an exclusion, it would seem to
frustrate rather further these purposes *

To have an efficient

police force you want to have the largest pool to select from
of capable individuals.

By excluding aliens whose contribu­

tions we welcome in other spheres, we cut down that possi­
bility.

We eliminate certain applicants who may be superior

to those who would be accepted, when we eliminate this group.
In particular, since we are a country of traditional immigrants
and there are large foreign-speaking populations, it can even
be suggested, as the amicus has, that there is e need to go
into this pool of potential foreign speakers and people who
have the ability to relate from time to time to Petitioner
immigrant groups.

7
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that aliens who

cannot speak .English are also a discreet insular minority,
or just —
MR. WEIS.i :

I would suggest they are but not one

that I would want on the police force*
suggestion.

That was not the

The suggestion is that it is possible to recruit

for particular skills, regardless of race, creed or color.
For example, if you have a large Spanish-speaking population,
you might want to recruit Spanish-speaking policemen, regard­
less of their race.

But if you have excluded from the pool

a large population which speaks Spanish as well as English
you may, in fact, fea limiting your ability to recruit 80 police
officers with what you are looking for®

What X am suggesting

is that the amicus suggestion may have some validity, that
there may be virtue even looking out for aliens to respond to
particular community needs.

However, there is no question

the ultimate resolution has to be the merit of the individuals
who serve on the police force.

They must pass those tests

and the more people we have applying with ability the more
likely we are to have a better group to. in fact, carry out
the law enforcement duties.
QU

1TI0N:

Various estimates made from time to time,

some .governmental and some private, are that we have from
the range of 8 million to possibly as high as 12 million
illegal aliens in this country.

Would you think Illegal alims

are a discreet insular group?
MR. WEI»c-:

Once again, Your Honor, X am sure they

are, but not one I think we should have on the police force.
The police force deals with people who must enforce the law
and one of the screening characteristics we should have on
the police force is to exclude those people who have committed
illegal acts.

We would not want the discreet minority of

ex "-convicts •—
QUESTION:

Obviously, whether it is 8 million or

12 million or 6 million, obviously this is a large group of
people who need some attention from law enforcement people.
To pursue your theory, if you went into the illegal aliens
for policemen, for law enforcement people, you would have a
group with some compatibility and empathy toward that group,
thereby enlarging the pool, as you put it,
MR. WEXhbj:

The argument could also be made that

for that reason we ought to hire ex-felony convicts because
they have some identity with the others —»
QUESTION:

it isnlfc my argument.

It is your

argument.
MR, WEXbS :

I am suggesting that there are certain

standards which should be met.

They should include very

clear skills of handling weapons, language to understand the
law and also, I would think, a policeman should, as a servant
of the law, be expected to have lived up to the law, not

9
anybody who is tainted with illegality„
QUESTION:

The issue is --

Would it make any difference to the point

you are making if the alien had been in the country for 10
years and just had Ignored the opportunity to become a citizen?
MR, WEISS:

Insofar as he continues to commit a

crime —
QUESTION:

No, no*

I am not talking about illegals*

I am talking about your man now, the person in your class,
your client*

If the person had been in the country 10 years

with abundant opportunity to become a citizen, would that make
any difference?
MR, WEIoS:
case?

Would it make any difference in this

In my opinion, it would not, because it would merely be a

different plaintiff for the same class*

We have these two

classes that are covered by the statute, those who cannot
change their status and those who can.

I would also suggest

that perhaps even for those individuals who can change their
status the clear.implications of Male lay are they too would
be covered by this Court’s decision, particularly since,
as Your Honors suggested in Malelay the employment right is
also a crucial factor in establishing whether or not something
is an unconstitutional discrimination*
QUESTION:

As to the illegal alien, isn't it true

that when he shows up he will no longer be an applicant?
MR, WEISS:

I would think that he would be an

10

applicant for deportation more likely than the state police
force, yes,
QUESTION:

You are really just speaking only of

resident legal aliens, are you not?
MR* WEISS:
QUESTION:

Yes,
secondly, we are concerned here with the

so-called New York State Troopers, and as 1 understand it
that is divided into three separate departments, the one
9

assigned to the Governor, and so forth, and the other one
highway patrol officers, and the third,the civilian guard
detective force, the CIS, or something.
Would your case be any different, would you be here
if we were concerned only with the New York City Police
department?

Would you be making the same arguments?

MR, WEISS:

I would think after Sugar-man v. Dougall

the case would be very similar, yes.

I think I would still

be here on New York City, but New York State,because it has
statewide application, breaks down, but I think I would have
a similar case for the City, yes,
QUESTION:

I ask this because you have referred

to a class as "policemen,"... and that, for sane reason, gives
me a municipal reaction, rather than a state reaction.

So

you make the same argument*
Lastly, in New York State, is a permit to carry a
gun under certain circumstances obtainable?

11

MR» WEISS:
QUESTION:

Do you mean for a private citizen?
Yes»

MR, WEISS:

Yes, I believe in both New York City and

New York State you can obtain them»
QUESTION:

Is it restricted to citizens or may

aliens also get them?
MR» WEISS:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, I do not know»
You. have so many New York statutes that

restrict everything to citizens I wondered,
MR, WEISS:

Well, New York State, as we suggest in

our brief, in one period passed a whole series of alien
exclusion and alien discrimination statutes causing a whole,
you might say, crazy-quilt of possibilities.
I do not know about handguns.

We list some,

If the Court wants, X can

submit a brief statement a couple of days after argument.
QUESTION:
Lav;?

Do you know what's, called the dull Ivan

Is that a New York City ordinance or a state?
MR» WEISS :

I believe that is a New York City

ordinance, Your Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. WEIo^ :

It's a state law, I think.

We can ask.

My Impression, Your Honor, it is very

clear it is the city and my learned counsel here agrees with
me on that.

I believe the New York City -- Sullivan Law

prohibits carrying handguns.
the State»

I do not believe it applies to

I can again clarify that.

12

QUESTION:

But the Sullivan Law is a felony, isn't

it?
MR, WE3BS:

I think the Sullivan Law is a misdemeanors

but I am not sure on that, but 1 am pretty sure it is a City
law.

I think it Is carrying concealed handguns and I believe

also it is a registration thing and various exclusions.
I am not familiar if that has an alien aspect to it.

Again,

I think

the exclusionary categories deal with character and past
criminal convictions and the like.
QUESTION:

Do aliens have the right to leave the

United States without a passport.

I suppose they have a

passport from their own country.
MR. WEISS:

1 believe that an alien with a resident

green card can, with permission from the consul, come and go
from the United States.
QUESTION:

Permission from the consul —

MR. WEISS:

Consul of the United states. I believe.

You have to notify them when you go and coming back, but if
you go out for more than a. particular period of time you
surrender that status.

You have to notify that you are

leaving and get permission.
QUESTION:

If an English alien, for example, wishes

to go back to England for a holiday does he have to get
permission from anyone?
MR. WEISS:

I don't know, Your Honor,

I believe

13
bo,

I do not know,

I cannot answer that.

I do know that

you do have to maintain residence in connection with the
United States for a period of time in order to retain your
green card»
It is our central conceptual argument here that the
conjunction of Sugaman v„ dougaII whlch says you cannot ex­
clude noncitizens from public employment in New York State,
and In Re Griffiths which holds that you cannot prevent aliens
from being lawyers, combined make an a priori case that you
cannot exclude people who want to apply for various law
enforcement jobs,

A policeman or trooper carries out the law

under supervision, under direction and in conjunction with a
whole paramilitary organization, as has been characterized
by the State.
QUESTION:

On the other hand, isn*t a member of your

group expected to excel and to go up the scale of the hier­
archy, so that before long, perhaps, he may be a captain or
major, or whatever you call them.and be exercising a lot more
policy decisions?
MR, WEISs.j

If it is possible for a policeman at the

top to exercise policy decisions, it might be possible for one
of this class to eventually be considered for that position.
At that point, however, I believe, in addition, the head of
New York State Police makes individual determinations as to
who should be promoted,

So if there were anything which could

14
conceivably be relevant in connection with his alienage, that
would be considered at that time»

But in any event, this

statute does not speak to a specific narrow group of possible
policy-makers in the New York State Police Department but,
rather, to every single conceivable applicant to the Mew York
State Police organization.
As a consequence, since this is. such a broad
exclusion, since it flies in the face of defining narrowly
who can be excluded and for what reasons, since it frustrates
the purposes of having a police force, since it falls against
the whole line of precedents that this Court has issued and
have been generated by this Court's decisions, we submit that
the exclusion from the Mew York State Police Department for
all noncitizens must be declared unconstitutional.
I would like to reserve whatever time I have for
rebuttal „
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Weiss.

Mrs. Gordon.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDITH A. GORGON, EDO.,
FOR THE Rib POND ANTE
MIL { GORDON:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may It please

the Court:
The issue presented for determination on this
appeal is whether permanent resident aliens, may be ex

-ded

from membership, the sworn officership status, of the New York

15
iitate Police,under New York Executive Law Section 215(3),
consistently with the aliens' rights under the Equal
Protection Clause.
Contrary to the suggestions In Appellant's brief
and a portion of his argument here today, there is no Issue
with respect to aliens who are in the alleged dilemma of
being caught between the federal five-year durational residence
requirement for naturalization and the generally applicable
29 year old age requirement for appointment to the State

Police.
QUESTION:

You said there is none?

MRS» GOiliON:

There is no such issue, Your Honor,

and that is for the reason that the case was brought as a
class action of all permanent resident aliens.

And I should

note here, Your Honor, that, of course, there is no issue with
respect to any other types of aliens, temporary resident
aliens or illegal aliens.

In any event, the class as defined

and stipulated to by Appellant is of all permanent resident
aliens who, but for the citizenship limitation in Section 215-3
would be eligible to apply for a position with the State Police
for membership in the State Police.
QUESTION:

Lid the District Court certify a class?

MRS. GORE ON:

Yes, Your Honor, and that is the

class essentially as 1 have given it to you and it appears in
the District Court opinion, a majority opinion, at pages A3

16

v

through 4 of the Appendix of the jurisdictional statement.
There Is, of course, no reference in that definition
of the class to the subjective expectations of the individuals
involved, as to whether or not they would want to become
citizens; likewise, there is no reference in that class action
order to the probable — or improbable likelihood cf the frus­
tration of those expectations, assuming that the individuals
had them, by the operation of the general age requirement.
The record below, in addition, does not support any
such alleged dilemma.
QUESTION:

The age -'What was the page number that you gave

us?
MRS 0 GORDON:

A3 through 4 of the Appendix to the

juriedicfciona1 statement.
Your Honor, I would call to your attention that in
this case the opinions are contained in the Appendix to the
jurisdictional statements and that the Appendix filed on this
appeal, the beige copy, has some documents of records that
were not previously filed. v
QUESTION:

Mrs, Gordon, this class is a little

different, at least a little broader than the cn® you
identified,

This talks about the Plaintiff and -all

other alien residents of the «state of New York who have
applied or will apply for the position of State Trooper.
Now that doesn't talk about permanent resident aliens, nor

17

legal aliens, nor anything else.

That's all, I suppose,

implied, but it is not stated.
MRS. GORDON:

Your Honor, I think that is expressly

implied and the — I am just trying to find the original
stipulation.
QUESTION:

Perhaps, on A3 and A4, that’s what it

says c,
MRS . GORDON:
Appendix,

If Your Honor looks at the beige

-22, Your Honor will find the stipulation so

ordered by Judge Pollack, which defines the class as con­
sisting of all permanent resident aliens who, but for the
enforcement of New York Executive Law 215.3 would otherwise
be eligible to compete for employment as Jfcafce Troopers.
QUESTION:

I suppose all permanent resident aliens

implies that they are not illegal aliens?
MRS» GORDON:

Yes, and that they are net temporary

aliens, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Certainly, permanent means not temporary

MRS. GORDON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

But there :ls nothing in here about legal

MRS. GORDON:

Right, and as I was indicating to you

because the age of the Appellant was not raised below,
because his entering status was not raised below, and because
the Date of his permanent residence status was not raised
below, there was no dilemma hypothecated before the District

18

Court and. obviously, the District Court majority so proceeded.
In fact* if you look at Judge Mansfield*3 dissent you will
find the reference to the alleged dilemma footnoted in his
opinion as a point raised in the Appellant's reply brief
before that Court after the case was —
QUESTION:

And this class.

MR.. GORDON;
QUESTION:

And this class.

It would inevitably include some in that

dilemma.
MRS * GORDON;

It might very well include some in

that dilemma, but the dilemma, the specific one the Appellant
seeks to argue, even if you concede him the facts that he now
alleges in his reply brief, namely, that he cured a permanent
resident status in 1974 and that he will be 30 years old in
1980.

He now alleges he was born in 1990.
QUESTION:

But this class, by definition, of those

who would otherwise be eligible to compete for employment
would include all resident aliens up to age 29, and obviously
would include, therefore, many who could not become natural­
ized citizens before they were too old to apply.

Just

inevitably.
MR-« GORDON:

That 's correct.

That might be so,

except with respect to this named Plaintiff it Is not so
because based on his new facts as alleged since he will not
be 30 until 1980 and since he can become a citizen in 1919)

19

he could be fully qualified to compete in the next examination
series»

That is our point with respect to that issue.
QUESTION:

If that becomes critical, at all, may

there not be some problem with the breadth of the class
certification?
MIS a GORvON:

If that is the issue, Your Honor,

there would be a problem with the breadth of the class certi­
fication, and it's our position here that that class certifi­
cation cannot be modified to admit of what are essentially new
allegations by the Plaintiff.

However, I think that it is

somewhat difficult for me to quite understand tie force of
Appellant *s argument with respect to the alleged dilemma*
If Plaintiff were actually in a dilemma, it would

connote that he wanted to become a citizen*

The distinction

that Appellant has attempted to draw throughout this litigation
is that aliens qua aliens are excluded, and that is the kind
of distinction that was made in oouga 11, the kind of distinction
that was made in Griffith and, indeed, the basis on which the
district Court determined the Issue,
QUESTION:

What if this Court were to hold that

although as to aliens who fulfill their residency requirement
and could become citizens before their 29th birthday, there
is no denial of equal protection worked by the New York
statute as to those in the class that Appellant alleges he
is in, those who can’t become citizens by their 29th birthday.

20

There is a discrimination.
What does the Court do with the class certification?
MRS 0 GORTON:

It would seem that the Court would have

to avoid it, Your Honor, except that I think —
QUESTION:
MRS

c

How do we avoid it?

GORTON:

You would, obviously have to -- It

was my view, Your Honor, that you could not change the class
certification and that the class certification framed the
issue in the case and, accordingly, this dilemma was not
reached*

If the class action certification had been modified,

and frankly I don't think that is necessary to the determina­
tion of this case, because as Mr. Justice Stewart points out
there are bound to be some individuals, this dilemma is
Illustrative of some potential class members, but if the
certification were to be modified it would seem that the case
would have to be remanded, Your Honor,
QUjIoT.TIN:

And if you win, you don't worry about it

at all,
MR?, GORDON:

cations.

That's right, Your Honor,

QUESTION:

That's.what 1 think you should be getting,

QUESTION:

Could I ask one question about qualifi­

Is 29 the maximum age at which you can become a

State policeman or get on the list of those who can work up
into becoming a State policeman?
MRS-, GORDON:

Technically, Your Honor, 29 would be

21

the age, 29 to the 30th year, would be the age for appointment
from the list.

However, the statute 215.3 in which that

limitation is incorporated, provides discretion to the
superintendent to extend the maximum age to 35 and, indeed,
it makes mandatory for up to six years extensions by virtue
of the performance of military service.

And that is another

aspect which we indicate in our brief would relieve Appellant
of his dilemma.
QUESTION:

All he has to do is join the Army in the

meantime.
MR-. GORDON:

Yes, that is one thing he could do,

Your Honor, but he could also -» I mean it would be frivolous
to think, Your Honor, that had Appellant pursued in a
reasonable course his application for citizenship and had he
taken the test and the time came for appointment and he was
about to be 31 but could not be naturalized because of the
formal proceedings which are-incident to that, in ..other
words, he was {toi'hg

to take his oath before a federal

officer, it would be frivolous to think that the Superintendent
would not extend his time, since he may stay ths age up to
35 to accommodate what were delays not within tie control of
the Appellant.
QU~-i.fi1 UN:

N
But it is discretionary, even though he

was on the list.
MRS * •'GORDON.

It is discretionary, your Honor, .yes v

22

Your Honors, a state is sovereign because it both
creates and enforces its own laws.

A State Police officer

performs sovereign functions in New York because he. in fact,
enforces New York laws.

His powers to arrest throughout

the state on his own initiative for all crimes and offenses,
his power to use force, including deadly force, his power to
search, his power to stop and frisk and to issue commands to
the general population which must be obeyed, which cannot be
resisted by force, are extraordinary and are unique to his
office.

If the officer exercises these powers, his acts

result in the forceabie detention of an individual and the
seizure of private property.

In addition, his acts-result in

the Initiation of the criminal justice process.
If he does not arrest, the officer has, like the
juror at a criminal trial, acquitted a potential defendant on
facts which in the judgment of another might constitute a
crime or arrest.

A police officer must decide which course

of action to follow and he alone is responsible for his
action.

If his judgment is questioned, he is entitled to a

defense only of the reasonableness of his acts .and judged on
the existing circumstances at the time his acts were placed
in question.

He cannot rely on superior orders and he has

no such defense under New York State law.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Gordon, you mentioned a juror.

aliens allowed to sit on juries?

Are

23

MRS o GORDON:

No, Your Honor, aliens- are not allowed

to serve on juries.
QUESTION:

That*8 in that whole bunch of statutes he

was talking about?
MRS o GORDON:

Well, quota aliens cannot be grand or

petty federal jurors or grand or petty state jurors, the Court
recently affirmed Perking _v ♦..Smith, involving state court
juror which had a citizenship requirement.
The State Police officer not only performs a
governmental function when he protects and prevents crimes
against private persons and property, but he performs specific
functions in aid of the preservation of the state itself as a
political entity.

He must guard against civil disorder,

insurrection, subversion and breach of the state*s security.
He guards the life of the Chief Executive and other dignitaries
in the state*
In light of the importance of his functions and his
identification with government, New York has designated him as
a public officer, since exactly 191? when the State Police
were created.
Now, Appellant does not dispute that the powers we
have just described are, in fact, the powers exercised by
police r
QUESTION: •

Mrs e Gordon, you said the state designated

him as a public officer.

What follows from that?

Is there a

definition somewhere in the Constitution of New York, or
elsewhere, as to what follows from being a public Officer?
MRS 0 GORDON:

Well, it is of some interest, Your

Honor, that in this Court Ss opinion in Douga11 v. Sugarman
the Court adopted a formulation of public officer which -■*>
QUESTION:

Tied somehow to the definition of New

York State?
MRS, GORDON:

Yes, well, in New York State a public
<

officer is one who exercises a portion of the sovereignty of
the state, that is, he is involved in the creation of the law,
the enforcement of the law, like a judge in the interpretation
of the lav?»
New, as a historical matter, categories of publicofficers have eventuated in Mew York, essentially by accretion,
other than in the common lav? tradition, other than the few
public officers that are maybe designated in the Constitution
or by statute, and the individual police officer, the State
Police officer, is specifically designated to be that public
officer because of these powers which invoke the sovereignty
of the state»
QUESTION:

Well, of course, in making an arrest,

they certainly invoke the sovereignty of the state, do they
not?
MRS » GORDON:

That is correct, Your Honor, he is,

in fact, the embodiment of the sovereignty of the state*

25
QUESTION:

Even directing traffic* I suppose,

MRS» GORDON;
the side*

When the officer pulls you over to

X think,, perhaps* you. could look at it this way*

Your Honor,

The response of the individual in society to the

officer's command* whether it is in the arrest or whether it
is in obedience to an order that he may give to a crowd* or
whether it is because he pulled you over to the side of the
road* that response* that obedience is given to him because
he is in this set of circumstances the embodiment of the law*
In that sense* he is the sovereign and in that sense his
orders shall be obeyed,
QUESTION:

There are some judicial opinions* I

don't recall them at the moment, that have said* even if they
were not holdings* that the police officers on their beat
exercise a broader discretion than a judge on the bench.
MR; e GORDON:

Absolutely* Your Honor* and that is

one of our points here* because*for example*it is only the
judge at a criminal trial who is both interpreter of the lav;
and trier of facts* who exercises the complete panoply of
incidents that the police officer exercises.

The police

officer's functions are discretionary because* given the law,
he must Interpret it and he must apply it to the facts.

His

guidelines* if you will* in that respect* are exactly the
same as the criminal court judge and* indeed* lass complete
than the juror because the juror functions under instructions

26

and charges given to him by the judge* and indeed less complete
than the grand juror who functions under judicial advice and
prosecutorial advice*
'QUESTION:

Donft you think they are all very

completely spelled out in our Fourth Amendment decisions?
MRS. GORION:
QUESTION:

What is spelled out* Your Honor?

The guidelines*

MRS o GOEOGN:

Yes* Your Honor* but the guidelines

are no more spelled out for the police officer than they are
for the judge* and I think that Is the quintessence of it*
QUESTION:

Wouldn't he be subject to exactly the

same examination that anybody else to find out whether he
knew what the lav/ was* whether he knew how to conduct himself*
and whether he knew how to act in the name of the state?
Wouldn t he have to pass the exact same examination?
MRS» GORL IN;

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor, he would have to pass

And if he passed it and he was ahead on

the list* he couldn*t get the job?
MRS« GORDON;

That is correct,. Your Honor* because

the preeminent concern here* Your Honor, is whether the state
when it seeks to enforce its sovereign powers* shall have the
choice of selecting from members of its own political commun­
ity or whether it shall be compelled to select from members
who are strangers to that community and who are members of

27
another sovereign community»
QUESTION;

Why were they strangers?

They pay the same taxes you do®

That's correct, Your Honor „

And they live right next to you.

MPr. „ GORDON:

That is correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

And they go to school with you,,

QUESTION:

Mrs, Gordon, I take it — I am repeating

my question now to your opposition

if we were concerned

here with the New York City Police Department, you would be
making exactly the same argument.
MR- * GORDON:

Your Honor, I think that is correct,

but I think that is the. exact limitation to which I would go,.
For example, State Police officers are said to perform the
highest law enforcement function because of their statewide
jurisdiction, but they do enforce all of the penal law of the
State of New York as well as some other criminal statutes,
A police officer in a metropolitan police district, while his
geographic area would be narrower, equally enforces the full
panoply of the penal law within that jurisdiction,
QUj.eT.ISN:

Do you know whether the statutes, or

whatever it is, that govern the New York City Police Department
require that officers be citizens?
MRS 0 GORDON:

Yea, Your Honor.

28

QUESTION:

So, you wouldn’t be disturbing that.

Would you do the same thing with a two-man police force in
some small town in upstate New York?
MRS„ GORDON:

First of all, Your Honor, the

Administrative Code of the City of Mew York does, in fact,
require police officers of the City of New York to be
citizens, and there is a case pending called Be Franco v□
Bronsteln on that issue in the State Courts at the moment.
I would argue that the limitation would be applied
in this way;

To the extent that the officer has full powers

of arrest and must make judgments with respect to broad guide­
lines, such as are encompassed in the penal law, I would
suggest that he would be an appropriate person

you would

define a class of positions from which aliens can be excluded
although we do not, of course, necessarily reach that issue
in this case.

It is his powers of arrest, his powers of

search ~~

.
QUESTION:

,

I am very much aware we don't reach it

in this case, but I am trying to find out the extent of your
argument.

There are other states that do not have this kind

of a requirement, is that not so?
MRS, G GKO ON:
question, Your Honor,

Well, that is open somewhat to
We performed a survey at the request

of the Court and it appears that at least 3^ states have the
requirement, the original 29 listed in the opinions of the

29

lower court, plus New York and California, which were not
included, plus several other states which operate by regulation
That is not to say that the balance of the states do not have similar limitations.

It is only to say that, in the course

of our endeavors and apparently as verified by the FBI, they
were not in statewide statutes.
It is a subject of some interest, Your Honor, to
point out that while there would appear to be some states that
do not have that limitation, 91% of the aliens live in statesthat do, in fact, have that limitation.

And, accordingly, I

do not think that we could infer much from those states which
do not operate police departments without the limitation 'when
their alien population is so small as to not have a particular
impact«
QUESTION;

Do you know what the origin is of this

vast number of New York statutes that prescribe citizenship
for masseurs, barbers, everything else?

Do you know the

historical basis for this?
MR; „ GORDON:

Your Honor, I had occasion to review

most of those statutes following this Court's opinion in
pouga 11 v» 8ugarman, and it is my understanding that their
backgrounds are various and that they are variously justifiable
This particular statute that we are concerned with is, it
seems to me, a common sense.matter of history and tradition.

citizens and I believe that the support for that »QUESTION:

The law was enacted In 1917.

MRb 6 GORDON:
QUESTION:

I do not, Your Honor*

Yes, Your Honor,.

In the middle of a World War and shortly

before we entered it, correct?
MRS* GORGON:

Yes, that is certainly the case and

certainly the tradition of local police forces in the state
naturally goes back much further and it is quite apparent the
City of New York limitation, for example, much pre-dates ~QUESTION:

You didn't have a ctate Police Force

until 1917?
MRP * GORDON:

No, not that I am aware of in the

formal sense that we talk about here.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Gordon, your answer to my brother

Blackmunfs question suggests that you would necessarily be
dealing with a total of 50 state police forces similar to
New York, with respect to alien requirement.

I know of my

own home State of Arizona which has vigorously eschewed the
idea of any sort of a state police force.

They have a state

highway patrol which simply enforces traffic offenses, and it

31

is my understanding that there are other states like that, too,
so that you donlt have 50 states who have a state police force
like New York.
MRi , GORDON:

That is correct.

For example.

California, which does require citizenship for its state
police officers, apparently does not require citizenship for
Its state highway patrol.
In possible elaboration of Mr. Justice Blackmun*s
comment before, the Division of New York State Police is not '
divided into a highway patrol, a specialized division covering
more significant matters than a uniform force.

It is one

division encompassing three functional units, namely, the
uniformed force, which provides a first-line response, and it
consists of officers who go out and arrest and search and
perform all the functions we discussed.

One of those units

is a three-way patrol unit, but its functions are not limited
to giving tickets on the New York dtate Thruway, rather it
has the criminal jurisdiction for that Thruway and it arrests
and searches and may stop and give highway tickets, but
performs all functions of enforcement within that geographical
area.

In addition, I would comment that while the SCI, the

Bureau of Criminal Investigation, is a plainclothes unit and
it does have a specific state security function, its powers
and its pursuit of its investigations, or the exercise of its
powers in the pursuit of Its investigations, is no different

32
than the response required of the uniform officer who makes
up the uniform force,
One last aspect on that would be that the Governor's
detail came to the Secret Service of’ the United States,

It

is, itself, a branch consisting essentially of uniform officers
with several BCI personnel.

So that there is no allocation of

higher and lower functions within these three essentially
functional units of the department.
QUESTION:

If you do not prevail here, if your

friend prevails and vie reverse, do you think New York can
keep these aliens off of juries, or do you see no connection
between them.?
MR; c GORDON:

It seems to me, regardless of the

outcome in this case, that New York would be able to keep
aliens off of juries, as it has a law on that point because
of this Court's decision In Perkins v. amlth.
QUESTION:

How about-voting?

MR; . GORDON:
Honor.

I was just going to say that, Your

It calls into very serious question the basis for

making analytical distinctions within governmental offices.
For example, if, as this Court has at least impliedly held in
its prior decisions, voting and legislating can be functions
consigned to citizens,

even though the voter is remote from

the lawmaking process, himself and his vote may be one in
millions in any given state or general election, to hold for

33
the Appellanti It would appear to me, one would have to find
that the police officer's exercise of these extraordinary
powers, of his arrest, of his search, of his use of force.
Indeed deadly force, his power over life and death of any
individual in the society in the name of the state, is somehow
less important than that voter's vote.

And I don't think that

that can possibly be an analytically sound distinction, and
accordingly it would appear to me, as we have argued, that
once we have determined that the juror performs a governmental
office such that citizenship may be required of him, we then
must likewise find that the police officer similarly performs
functions of significant and governmental nature, such that
*■

his class may likewise be closed to aliens»
I think, by the way, that this is one of the faults
of the dissent below.

The dissent characterizes voting and

legislating as political.

It eschews the same characterization.,

obviously, for the police force.

And I don't think that that

distinction again can be made, because in a government of
three co-equal branches we cannot designate voting, especially
under the circumstances as I outlined where it may have very
little, if any, potential ramification, as more important than
law enforcement.

Nor, of course, can we designate it as more

important than the judicial function of interpreting the lav;v
And I think that this is one of the erroneous assumptions that
the dissent below makes.

34
I would say several other points with respect to
that dissent and,that is, with respect to the issue raised
by Justice Mansfield and I think briefly by Justice Marshall
before, that aside from the designation of a class of office
holders, is there anything about the alien, by virtue of his
status, which makes him peculiarly unsuitable to perform the
functions of the police?

And while we urge this as a secondary

matter, we believe that there are in fact such situations.
For example, the alien cannot vote.
\

To call upon him then

for the vigorous enforcement of the law, laws which he has
no voice in creating, would appear to be ©gregiously anomalous.
It appears -~
QUESTION:

That was true In Re Griffiths, that

anomaly, if it be one,
MRS o GORGON:

That is true, except we do not

ordinarily consider the attorney qua attorney as a law
enforcer, and for that reason he is not an officer.

Certain

attorneys may, indeed, be governmental officers but -~
QUESTION:

That would also apply to 70# of the

electorate who donft vote,
MRS o GORjON:

That is correct, Your Honor, but

It is the capacity to be able to vote, rather that is at
issue and aliens are incapacitated from doing so.
In addition, it is illustrative
QUESTION;

What about those state officers who

35
make the decision whether to prosecute or not?
MRS. GORDON:

That may very well be one example of

the attorney who is a governmental officer, but 1 do not
think the attorneys, that prosecutor's decision not to prosecute
in a case, seemingly, is akin to the police officer's decision
not to arrest.

Accordingly, if we w/ere to say -»

QUdhTIGM:

What about the decision to prosecute?

If you!ve got the power to decide whether or not to bring a
criminal charge that could result in life imprisonment or
death, what about prosecutors, may they be aliens in your
state?
MRS. GORDON:

The issue has not been presented, but

it would seem to me, Your Honor, that one could fairly argue
that that class should be limited to citizens, because that
power to ~~ the use of the coercive power of the state
ivhich is what the prosecutor does when he seeks an indictment
or files some information would seem to me to be governmental,
and arguably limited to citizens.

However, judges:are -

by law, both federal and state law, Your Honor, are public
officers and are limited to citizens.

However, I would call

to Your Honor's attention that while the prosecutor's functions
are drastic, perhaps, the police officer's functions are even
more drastic,

We do not normally have the situation where

the prosecutor must make an assessment as to whether, as to
»

how much force or deadly force to use in a given situation.

36
The State Police Officer exercises that function because he
is* indeed, the representative of the state.
QUESTION:

In other words, the prosecutor has no

discretion to pull the trigger and shoot someone under any
circumstances, but a policeman has it under many,
MRSc GORDON:

Where that is the very activity or

very power that is vested in the policeman, that is correct.
Returning for a moment to the other characteristics
which aliens have which we believe makes them unsuitable, are
those which evidence his citizenship to another sovereign and
his subjection to the laws of that sovereign.

For example,

an alien in the United States may be conscripted by the
country of his nationality.

However, in the United States

he may plead treaty exemption, he may plead international law,
he may change his immigration status and avoid the draft and
military service in the very country which people like Appellant
suggest have the laws which they wish to enforce»
I think that's sufficient, Your Honors,
Thank you.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Weiss, do you have

anything further?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN A . WEIoS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MRe WEISS:

Yes,

First, as to whether-there are some police

37
departments who do not have the citizenship requirement,
they are mentioned in Footnote 4 of Judge Mansfield's dissent,
. I would just like to focus briefly on the question
of sovereignty and its relationship to taking an oath, which
was discussed In He Griffith,,

It should be noted, by the way,

in passing, that aliens who are in the Army also serve in
the Military Police there.

So that aliens who pay taxes, are

subject to the draft, ivho protect the Government's security
also protect the Internal security inside the Amy.

seem to be a fairly strong analogy, as good as —

police duty?
MB.. VhJLSaj

No, I am not suggesting that, I am

QUESTION:
MR» WHEk;:

That's a matter of choice and discretion,
Yes, but it becomes an issue as. to

whether or not there were police departments which in fact
continued because of a uniform policy across the country.
This is an illustration of a sovereign, United otates, that
has chosen not to make this alien exclusion,
The issue presented to the Army would, of course, be
a much more difficult issue than this case, being both
federal and also national security.

In terms of a congres­

sional statement implicitly as to the reliability of aliens

38
who serve in the police force* this seems to be a fairly
powerful implication»
The discretion that a police officer has is not a
political discretion, is not a policy discretion»

It is a

discretion different in function and nature from those acts
thought of in f'ougall suggestion.

What you have there are

political decisions of a policy-making sort.
here are factual applications.

What you have

framework, rather than gives the framework.

It functions in

terms of facts rather than in terms of continued public
policies,
As far as the representation cf a sovereign by a
police officer, I think it would be demeaning to this pro­
fession if it is suggested that a police officer is mere of
a representative of the law, thinks more of the law than a

any more, that a lawyer would not have a particularly higher
role in that than anyone else.
