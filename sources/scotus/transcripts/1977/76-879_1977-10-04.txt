ORAL ARGUMENT OF WARD L. JOHNSON, JR. . SSO» ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR» JOHNSON:

Than* you»

Mr. Chief Justice, ax.d if it please the Court:
This

is a direct appeal from the District Court

for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, which declared a
Wisconsin^ Stats statutes, imposing a certain marriage re­
quirement, unconstitutional0
The facts in this case are not in dispute.
The named plaintiff, Redhail, six years ago,
approximately, fathered a baby girl out of wedlock.
time he. was in high school.

At that

Two years later he applied for

4
permission

to marry to th® County Clerk of Milwaukee County

in the State of Wisconsin, because o'f a marriage requirement
th© Clerk denied him a license.
The requirement that was a basis for the denial by
th© County Clerk was that a person who has minor children not
in his custody,, to whom he has an obligation to support, must
get permission from a court to marry.
In Mr. Redhail’s case, he had never been married,
W© suspect the bulk of the cases arising, where there is a
requirement to get a court's permission, are those cases
involving people who have been divorced, who have been married
before..
At this point, Mr. Redhail filed a complaint with
the District Court for th© Eastern District of Wisconsin,
petitioning the court to declare the statute unconstitutional
because it infringed or impinged upon his constitutional right
to marry.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Attorney General, is th© statute

still operative?
MR. JOHNSON:

What about this nsw legislation?

MRa JOHNSONs

Yes.

MR» JOHNSON;

Nothing»

Th© Legislature has

Of

QUESTIONs

You were going to tall res, Mr, Attorney

General?
MRo JOHNSON;

Yes.

Assembly Bill 100,, which is now

before the Governor for signature, retains the present statute
intact,

Its operation is suspended when there's any

injunction enjoining the enforcement procedures under 245»109
which ---QUESTIONs

As there is in this case,

HR, JOHNSON:

It, was tailor-made legislation to

accommodate this appeal.
QUESTION:

If this Court —

But, as I understand it, that statute

becomes — when the Governor signs it, that automatically,
since there's an outstanding injunction here, suspends the
operation of the statute we have before us?
MR. JOHNSON; As long as there is an injunction
pending, restraining the enforcement of that statute, yes.
QUESTION:

So you ar© —

MR. JOHNSON a

And another statute comes into play

that slightly modifies the statute under question.
QUESTION:

Let me approach it from 'Hie other side.

If the statute which is now on the Governor's desk had bean
in affect, at the time this - case arcs©, would there be any
case?
That's what I think we’re trying to prove that.
MR. JOHNSON:

I believe because of the accommodation

7
in tiie new statute to give the court greater discretion in
terms of people who have never been married before, that the
statute

that teer© would be no — that Mr. Redhail would

not have been a suitable representative plaintiff,
QUESTION? But he still would have had to seek the
approval of -the court?

Under the ~~ if -the new statute

had bean in affect, this new statute we’re talking about,
had bean in effect then, he would still have to go to the
courts f would he?
MR, JOHNSON?
QUESTION s

Not, Mr. Redhail.

Then we come to what we5 v© bean trying

ta get at.
MR. JOHNSON;
QUESTION?

Okay.

Is there a case left bars?

If the new

statute is? signed by the Governor tomorrow or the next clay.
MR. JOHNSON:

Yes, Mr. Chair Justice, in that teat

statute is only operative when there is a restraining order
against the enforcement of the present statute, 245 ~~
QUESTION; And there is a restraining order?

MR. JOHNSON; By the tersa-judge court, the District
Court for tee- Eastern District of Wisconsin, yes.
QUESTION;

Well, when that new statute becomes

operative, it means Mr. Rack ail teen can get married, without
applying to a court for permission to gat married, doesn't it?
MR, JOHNSONs

Mr. Radbail could have gotten married

8
as soon as the court: issued its injunction*

marry.

And then I also read: "plaintiff desires to

He and the woman he intends to marry are expecting a

child to be born in early March 1975."
My question is;
MR. JOHNSON:

was -that child ever born?
I do not know.

So Mr. Redhai1 filed a complaint with the District
Court, and at this point I would point out that he did not go
to a judge to seek permission to remarry, and counsol for the
plaintiffs have mad© a great, point of the fact that the
.‘statute permits a judge to grant permission, when he finds
that the child of the non-custodial parent is a public charge
or likely to become a public charge.
Mr. Redhai! felt that, apparently, that ha could,
nevsr meet the test, required by "or likely to become a public

11
charge”.
courts»

This phrase has never been construed by Wisconsin
If construed very narrowly, I would suggest that it

could be equated with a settling of accounts up to date.
It is on the basis of this that we have suggested
perhaps the District Court might have abstained, as suggested
in Beata

Bosaaieh and subsequent cases under that

doctrine»
Now, the thro©»judge court decided that this should
be a class action, carefully noting in their decision that
we have two classes, really, of plaintiffs? on©, the named
plaintiff, who had never been married before? and the other
category would be people who had been married before and wore
divorced.
They also found end certified as a class all of -Mi©
County Clerks of fcha State of Wisconsin? w© have 72 County
Clerks*

Tha class is very easily identifiable.

We objected

in oral argument, as acted in the court’s decision, to
certifying such a class without notification to the 71 other
County Clarks.
QUESTION:

Mr. Johnson, could I go back one point?

You said the reason that perhaps the court should have
abstained was that th® "likely to become a public charge"
language might or might not apply.
a public charge?

But is not the child now

Didn’t the. District Court find that?

MR. JOHNSON t Thar© was no determination on this

12
particular occasion whether this child was a. public charge,
but Mi® child was an AFDC recipient, and there's no question
that Mr* Rsdhail would not have obtained judicial permission
to remarry, because of the AFDC benefits being extended to
his daughter.
QUESTION;

Then you wouldn't have any occasion Iso

worry about the "likely to become a public charge” language.
MR» JOHNSON;

I don't know,

We're speculating

about the futura, but —
QUESTION s

But not as to this particular litigant»

We know that h© could not have gotten the approval.
MR, JOHNSON:

Not without pacing up the arrearages

which *—
QUESTION;

Even if he paid the arrearage, the child

would still b® a public charge.

Isn't that true?

As long as she is receiving the $103 a month, from
AFDC.
I just, want to be sura I understand your argument.
MR. JOHNSON;

Okay.

Yes.

But it's possible that

had h© paid up his arrearages, and showed his ability to
meet the support order, that he would have secured judicial
permission to marry.
QUESTION: Evan though th© child was still on AFDC?
MR, JOHNSON:
QUESTION;

If 3ha was on AFDC, no.

All right.

And sh® is ©n AFDC.

13
MR. JOIINSONs

She was at the 'time.

QUESTION; But presumably, if ha went into court and
showed that he had a job making $900 a month and paid up the
arrearages and the child was off of welfare, then you. suggest
th© permission would have been granted?
MR. JOHNSON;
QUESTION;

I think 30.

Doss it make a difference under your

statute whether -die child is in the father's custody?
MR. JOHNSON;
QUESTION;

Yes.

It is that —

Why?

MR. JOHNSON;

The statute says so.

The rationale,

I suppose. Justice Blaekmun, being that the custodial parent
already has ‘die burden of the care and has the right to
expect contribution from the non-custodial parent.
QUESTION;

Well, the child may be on welfare ©von

when she's in the father's custody? couldn't she?
MR. JOHNSON;

Sure.

We’re not suggesting that -the law is absolutely
perfect and -that -there arm no gaps, loopholes, whatever you
want to call them.

We do the best we can in terms of a

standard for marriage requirements.
QUESTION; Well, it certainly isn’t perfect.

I

suppose there's an much risk to the State of Wisconsin to
allow a marriage of .a childless indigent as there is to one
who has a child.

The childless indigent can produce, too.

MR. JOHNSON:
a record to go on.

Well, let's look at —

Presumably.

But at least here we have

Whereas we do not have in the case you

suggested.
QUESTION: That's vrhy I was trying to help you out,
wondering whether there was a second one that he spawned.
MR. JOHNSON:
QUESTION:

We don't know.

Wall, wouldn't a judge — in this case,

if there is another child about to be bom, illegitimately,
and this man wants to marry the girl in order to give that
child a name, do you mean th© judge wouldn't give him that
permission?
MR. JOHNSON:
QUESTION:

I dp not know.

If I were to predict -*~

Yes.

MR. JOHNSON:

--- I would say that the judge would

probably stick by the statute and refuse.

But that's just

my prediction.
QUESTION:

So the State of Wisconsin's public

policy is that it's better to have two illegitimate children
than one.
MR. JOHNSON:

Th® policy is that we are not going

to condone, by a piece of paper called a marriage 1 icons®, —
QUESTION:
MR. JOHNSON:

You don't condone it, you'll compel it?
So that's one of -the weaknesses of

15
the statute.

But there's something to be said on the other

side, too, and I guess that's why 1 *m hers.
All right.

The three-™judge court then certified a

class action for all of the named defendants»

At oral

argument-we objected, on the: basis of no notice to them.
The court, the Circuit Court,,- split on this, one follov/ing
the ironclad rule to give a notice? the other Circuit saying,
well, if there's adequate representation, the notice can be
dispensed with»
Now, then, the court, the three-judge court said
this statute of Wisconsin impinges upon a fundamental right,
the right to marry, and that, this requirement of going to the
judge and getting permission to remarry impinges upon that
fundamental right, and it's therefore a suspect statute
and follows that the* State must show a compelling State
interest to sustain its validity.
And we object on this appeal to the application of
this stringent, result-oriented type of test.
I think it was .back in United States vs. Caroline
Products, where a footnote by the writer of that opinion
indicated that statutes are entitled to a strong presumption
of constitutionality except perhaps where there is a right
expressly set forth in the Constitution itself.
This idea, of course, has grown and culminated, as
we pointed out, in Shapiro to. Thorapsoa. in 1969, when the

16

Court: found that till a right to travel — and of course it was
in connection with welfare benefits

was a fundamental right

and the State had to show some compelling State interest that
would override this impingement or this entitlement to
exercise the fundamental right#
Since that time, that case, the Raddle case on
right to divorce, the Griswold case, have all bean cited in
terms of their language to suggest this familial privacy
right, and to suggest that anything that touches upon the
marriage, the right to marriage, all of its collateral
attributes, is suspect and subject to this tost#
Though we note that in the Iowa case regarding the
durational residency requirement of Iowa, Shapiro vs# Thompson
doctrine of compelling State interest was not applied.
QUESTION: Dees Wisconsin recognize common-law
marriages?
HR# JOHNSON:

It. does not.

Now, Justice Harlan, in his dissent in Shapiro,
pointed out. the danger of labeling something as a fundamental
right, which invokes this, as we call it, result-oriented test,
%

Stringent test, that the State must show a compelling State
interest to override the impingement.
I would suggest. —
QUESTION:

Shapiro held, did it not, that the

right of interstate travel is & constitutional right, a

17
constitutionally protected right?
MR. JOHNSON:

Yes.

QUESTIONs And that was emphasized in the concurring
opinion, that it was mors than just a subjective view of
this Court that it was a fundamental right, but held rather
that it was the right of interstate travel as contrasted with
international travel and is a constitutionally protected

MR® BLONDIS:

MR. BLONDISs
QUESTION;

Yes.
Was th© marriage before or

after that?

Afterwards, Your Honor.

So the class had been certified before

the Illinois marri&c® took placa?

31
MR. QLONDIS i

Yes.

The class -- yes, that’s right.

And after, wall after oral argument had taken place.
Your Honor, the State, in its brief, proposed to
this Court that because this is a statute dealing with,
marriage and divorce, the State has a peculiar interest- in
that area

and therefore this Court should supply a rational

relationship, equal protection or, I suppose, substantive due
process analysis to this case.
The State, in my opinion, gave no good reason why
that should be the case.

We are aware of cases, both in

marriage and divorce and in voting and probat®, where this
Court has held that States have a peculiar interest in those
areas.

But we don’t believe that the Court has ever gone

so far as to hold that regulations which adversely affect
serious long-standing fundamental constitutional rights are
going to be completely deferred to by tea State, by the
application of tee rational relationship, equal protection
test.
Concerning the purposes of the statute, tee State
argued in the lower court that tee purpose of the statute was
the provision of counseling tp persons who are about to undergo
marriage.

I foxing that up only because the only legislative

history available behind this

statute, which is cited at

pages 29 through 32 of our brief, indicates teat teat, in fact,
was the benevolent purpose of this statute.

It was to provide

32
counseling for persons who had support obligations and we:
about to undergo marriage.
This statute obviously has nothing to do with
counseling.

Counseling isn't oven mentioned in the confines

of the statute.
Courts are not encouraged ox* mandated to give
counseling, nor are applicants to the courts encouraged to
get it.
So if counseling is still the purpose of the statute,
it's completely irrational.
The reason most seriously put forth by the State
presently, in this appeal, is that this statute protects the
interests that Hr. Redhail's child has to support®
Wa don't believe that that, either, is tlx® intent of
this statute.
Mr. Redhail*s child has been supported by — under
th® AFDC program, almost sines her birth.
child.

That is the first

The debt that Mr, Redhail owes is not to that child?

the debt that he owes is to the Stats of Wisconsin.
What Wisconsin is saying, in effect, to Mr. Redhail
is that2

Until you pay us, you can't gat married.
QUESTIONS

You mean a father ha-3 no responsibility

MR. BL0ND1S:
all.

No, Your Honor, I’m not saying that at

33

Mr. Redhail *—* when Mr. Redhail wsat to paternity
court in 1972. ha admitted paternity in that action, and the
court ordered that ho pay support of $109 per month.

That,

although as the State agreed he was a minor and a high
school studento
In any event, the AFDC, which h© received, which his
child is receiving, is substantially above idle $109 per month
that ha was ordered to pay.
Therefore, what I am saying is that even if Mr.
Redhail tomorrow came into the Clerk of the Court with all of.
his arrearages, under the $5.09 support order, and paid ©very
cent of it, and even paid the $109 sometime into the future,
he still could not get married, because his child would still
become — would still remain a pub5.1c charge.
So, how the State can justify the statute by saying
that it —

The State has enacted the statute, and

it’s presumptively constitutionally, valid*
MR. BLONDXS:

Isn’t it?

I understand that, Your Honor*, But

what I'm saying- is that what I just said indicates that it
really doesn't have much to do with its intended purpose.
QUESTION; Well, then, why —» than the Stats should
not put support orders in at. all.

MR» BLONDIS s

What I am saying is that the

is not — this particular statute is not related to child
support»
If the State is serious about collecting child
support from Mr. Redhail, the State has many methods available
to it, which are very effective»

The State can take Mr,

Redhail back into that paternity court, which originally sot
the $109 per month support, and the State can says

Mr. Redhail,

you tell the court why you haven’t paid the $109.

QUESTIONs

MR. BLONDIS:
is that it’s my understanding#
under either the substantive due process or the equal

that analysis is that there must be a showing, not only that
there's a compelling Sta-fcs interest, and that the legislation
is tied to that interest, but that -there is no lass intrusive
method available for the State to accomplish its legitimate
goal „
