MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

V7e will hear arguments

next in 1359, Bankers Trust against Mallis.
Sr. Weiner, yo\* may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACK II. WEINER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
HR. WEINER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 under the Securities
Exchange Acs of 193^ does nob proscribe all fraudulent schemes
that have anything to do with securities.

It only proscribes

and renders unlawful those fraudulent schemes that are, quote,
,!in connection with the purchase or sale of any securities"
end of quote.
The.case pres ants two questions.

One, whether a

pledge of securities as collateral for a commercial loan was
a purchase >r sals herein within the meaning of th® 1934 act
which definae purchase, quote, "to include any contract to buy,
purchase, or otherwise acquire"—end of quote—to permit a
pledges to >risg an action under Section 10(b) and Rule lQb-5.
Tie second' question is whether the "in connection
with" requi rexaents of the act ara satisfied when a bank which
releases ''Collateral to its debtor upon th© repayment, of th©
indebtedness, as it was required to do under law, and the
alleged sal© is th® pledge of securities by a third party to a

4
plaintiff vrho :is totally unknown to tha bank.
The facts in this case are fairly simple»
(

Did you say they are simple?
Yes, Your Honor, they are fairly simple.

MR. WEINER:
C

I road the briefs in this case a week ago in an

airplane, and I thought, I was going crazy.

[Laughter]

Maybe the altitude was getting t© me.
MR. WEINER:

Maybe-. I could help to clarify it.

Feel

free to interrupt and ask ary questions, Justice Stewart.
[Laughter]
C

W«i will not hesitate, counsel.

MR. WEINER:

Thank you, sir.

Eankors Trust is

bank.

It received approximately

40,000 shares of Equity National Stock as collateral for a
loan in August of 19"0.

sx.

At, that time the lending officers

opinion letter cf counsel that, the stock would be

negotiable witl

mgnths.

When a bank receives a pledge of

stock, it dees not look to the collateral for repayment.

It

primarily asks hew the indebtedness is going to be repaid and
looks at the credit worthiness of the borrower, plus other
elements relating- to repayment.

A banker does not make a loan

with the expectation that he is going to be required to
foreclose on collateral to collect its indebtedness, regardless
of whether the collateral is stock, real estate, cattl©, or
accounts receivable financing.

A banker does not want to be

an expansive foreclosure proceeding.

He does not

Ha merely wants the return of ‘the

monies h© loaned.
The bank in this case playad no role whatsoever in
arranging with Mallis and Kupferman, the respondents herein,
to borrow money from Franklin National Bank, which they then

loaned to I maid and Fowler and received a pledge of collateral ;

from Arnolc and Fowler.
V

f

Let me just isolate, if I may, the very first

part of the transaction—
MR. WEINER:
C.

Good.

--which you described where the Bankers Trust

received the pledge from th& Georgia Bank.
HR. WEINERi
C

It received it from Mr. Kates.

From Mr.. Kates.

Would you go so far as to say

that if Mr. Katas had made a fraudulent representation with

respect to th® value of the securities that he was pledging to
Bsinkers Trust and Bankers Trust alleged that it relied on that
representation, that Bankers Trust would not have a 10b-5 action
against Katas?
MR. WEINER?

Our position is that Bankers Trust

Company is©3 net need to proceed against

'him in 10b-5.

ht

the time h© pledged the collateral—
Q

Could it?

Ml. WEINER:

Our position, Your Honor, is that it

6
does not need that.

He would have executed a note at that

time as well «a:; the pledge of collateral.

And we could

proceed age inst him on the note.
Q

Could you proceed against him on the note under

10b-5?
MR. WEINER:

No, we would not need that.

We could

proceed against him in state court.
C

Could you proceed against him by virtue of the

fraudulent representation in connection with the pledge by
virtue of 10b-5?
MR. WEINER;

Our position is we do not need that as

a remedy.

0

I was not asking you whether you needed it.

I

was asking whether it would be available if your management
changed and the. new management thought, you did need it.
C

Is not your position

simply that there would

be no sals under the circumstances?
MR. WEINER:

That is correct.

There is no sale.

Q

So, the answer is no,

Q

That is all I was trying to find out.

MR. WEINER:

do you have any other questions, Mr. Justice Rehnquist?
Q

MR. WEINER:

The loan was in the process of being

In 1971 a dispute arose between Kates, the pledgor,

7
and Equity National, ’the issuer of the stock»

Bankers was

informed of the dispute by Equity National who asked that the
stock be returned to them.

They then contacted Kates, and

Kates*s attorneys advised Bankers not to return the collateral,
but he was antitied to return of the collateral upon repayment
of the indebtedness.
Bankers then informed Equity National that it was
obligated to the return of the collateral to .its borrower,
Kates, upon repayment of the indebtedness.

And it might

consider talking to Equity National if it were indemnified.
Equity National did nothing.
A year later negotations began between Kates,
Arnold, and Fowler with respect to the Equity National stock as
well as a b Lock of odd a hundred thousand shares of Merck
stock..

And at that time Kates

tions handled together.

wanted to have these transac­

Bankers did not introduce Katas to

Arnold and Fowlar and hud no relationship there.
On February 24, 19'?2 a contract ©f sale was entered
into between Katas, Arnold and Fowler with respect to the
Equity National stock and with respect to the Merck stock.
Q

There was a Mr. Kupferman somewhere in here too.

Ml.. WEINER:

No, he comes in later in the picture.

He is much later in the picture, Your Honor.
Q

That particular sale you would concede is a

sale within the meaning of the statute?

8
MR, WIENER:
Q

Kates to Arnold and Fowler,

MR, WEINER:
Q

The sale between --surely,

Kates to Arnold and Fowler is a sale,

The pledges were not In connection with that

sale,
MR, WEINER:
Q

That is correct, sir,

The release of the pledge was not—

MR, WEINER:

That is correct, sir.

In that contract the closing was scheduled for February

29th,

On February 29th apparently Arnold and Fowler did not

have the $196,000 but Fowler gave Kates and additional $10,000
to get an extension of time.

He received a four or five day

odd extension of time for this thing, and again this was unknown
to Bankerso
ITnbenkownst to Bankers, Mallis had some dealings with Mr .
Arnold on or about March. 1st,

Arnold told Mallis of the deal,

and he said someone Gould make some money if they would loan him
the funds fcr which he would be able to consummate the transaction
he was going to make $400,000 out of $480,00 odd thousand.
Arnold suggested that he participate, and then in his
affidavits, Mr, Mallis states that it was suggested also by Mr,
Murfitt of Franklin National Bank that Mr, Murfitt told Mall, s
that Kates en.1o.yed a good reputation ir. the business world anc
that his securities appeared worthwhile and few if any restric­
tions were okayed.

9
Then. there was an agreement by Mallis and Kupferman to
borrow monies from Franklin and loan the money to Arnold and
Fowlero

Bankers again was tctally unaware of this, Bankers

was not present at any of these transactions with Mallis and
Kupferman ,

On the morning of March 3rd, Mallis and Kupferman

went into the offices of Franklin National Bank in the suburbs ,
They signed the necessary documents, and then Mallis was told by
Murfltt no need to be present.

He expected the transaction to

be paid by the sale of a hundred thousand shares of Merck &
Company stock,
The pledge transaction was a usurious contract because
Dr, Mallis ft the time he loaned these gentlemen $156,000 was
going tc make a., quote,

"profit” of $50,000 within 30 days.

Arithmetica]ly computed, that comes to 363 percent.

And this

was raised by Mr, Fowler in the state court action.
The critical fact here is that no one alleges that
Bankers Trust nor any of its representatives, including its
attorneys, did anything either by action or mon^action until
the closing on

;he afternoon of March 3rd,

introduce Kates to Arnold and Fowler,

Bankers did not

Bankers did not even

know the existence of Mallis and Kupferman until after the
closing and the
q

beginning of the lawsuits,

Mr. Weiner, would it make any difference if the

bank had introduced the parties or known all these details?
Would that have any relevance to the legal issue?

10
MR. V’EINERs

It does not have any real relevance to

the issue.
Q

Then why do we dwell on those facts?

MR. WEINER:

But they gave the in-connection here*

the in-cennBction-with argument, sir.
Q

Only for purposes of our decision, w© wonId have

to assum® that Bankers Trust committed

That is correct, sir.

Bankers5 only function at the collateral, was to
return coll iter al to its debtor,, Kates, upon repayment of th©
indebtedness as it was required to do under th© New York
Uniform.Commercial Code.
At th:-» closing, Arnold asked Kates for an affidavit
on behalf of the respondents , Mallis and Kupfsrraan.

On the

basis of information furnished by Fowler, he moved that there
was a problem batween Equity National, Kates, and Arnold.
Fowler had contacted the president of Equity National, and h-s
told Arnold of this.

That is. in th© depositions in the state

court which we just obtained.

And Arnold accepted an affidavit

from Kates saying that there were no restrictions.
At that time, Bankers had no knowledge with respect
to these transactions.

The stock was redeemed by Mr. Kates,

and it was returned to th® Kites©s.

Indeed, at the closing a

Bankers Trust Company and Kates.

Bankers Trust Company

refused to touch that' check because Bankers Trust said, "I am
not privy to any of theses transactions.”
Originally © state court of action was instituted
against Bankers.

That action was dismissed.

Tha Court just

said, "How oouli Bankers be liable when 'they did not know
these people and had nothing to do with these people?"

But

at the same time that action was dismissed, a suit against
Fowler and Arnold, who ware still part of that action,
alleging a breach of contract as well as fraud.
Arnold instituted

third party actions on the breach of

These actions are still, pending in

Indeed, the deposition of Mallis by Bankers

is new scheduled for February 1, 1978.

This is plainly an

analogous situation to the Bit .a Chip case and Birnbaum whereby
there is a remedy in state court.

The cases are still ponding

in the state court, and there is no need for 10(b) or 10b-5
in this situatior..
It is cur position that a pledge of stock is not a
sale within the meaning of the act.

The. plain language of

the act in Bln© Chip Stamps and Hochfelder, as pointed out
by this Court there , stated that since we are dealing with a
judicially created right, the Court must construe the statuta
narrowly,

and the pledgee, as is Bankers, must act in accordance with law.
And 'the Uniform Commercial Cod© very carefully defines the
duties and obligations of a pledgee in that situation,
Q

Mr» Weiner, when you talk about the act* I take

it you are talking about the Securities and Exchange Act of
1934»
Ml. WEINER:
Q

That is correct, sir»

And yet I look at the complaint, and it seems—

the action teems to have been brought under the Securities Act
of 1933.
Mh WEINER:

The action was originally instituted

under the Securities Act of 1933«

In fact, they even assert

in that that the only obligation of Bankers was to return the
collateral :o Mr. Kat.es»

Subsequent thereto, there were various

attempts ‘to amend the complaint, and they attempted to amend
the complaint by making numerous affidavits to Judge Pollack.
Judge Pollack treated these affidavits as if they were part of
an amended complaint and treated this as if it were an action
under the 1134 act and Rule L0fo-5.

And that is how it

proceeded from Judge Pollack to the Court of Appeals,

13
Q

And it is clear now all around, is it, that the

complaint is under the '34 act—MR. WEINER:

That is correct.

We are litigating it

They say otherwise

We would prefer that that

act also be construed as not including a pledge.
C

It. is pretty hard to do so, would it not fo®?

MR. WEINER: ‘ Pardon?
C

It. is pretty hard not to say a pledge is a

disposition of m interest in a security.
MR. WEINER:

The SEC, Allan Trupe, the Pair lie;

14
general counsel—dt was decided in our brief“-refer to that
definition, anc they sort of indicate that a pledge was not a
sale for purposes of the 1933 act.
Q

But, in any event, we are dealing here with the

'34 act and Ruis 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.
Ml. WEINER:

W© are dealing with the '34 act, sir,

right.
Q

And there is no statutory definition of sale;

is that rig it?
Ml. WEINER:

There is non® in the act, sir.

It is

just sale or purchase'..
I am saving time for the Clearing House.
A3 -this Court has stated in its recent decisions in
Santa Fe, Piper ,7 and Blue Chip Stamps, Congress in enacting
the 1934 Securities Act did not intend to create a federal
commercial law.

Congress merely intended to regulate the sale

and purchase of securities as an investment.

Congress did not

intend to gat involved with blending the commercial paper
situation ii this area.

Indeed, if w© broadly construe,

purchase for XCb-5 purposes, as sought by the SEC and as found
by the Sacond Circuit, would render an unmanageable flood of
litigation.

Whenever a loan goes into default, the debtor
«

frequently will utilise any source to avoid and delay repayment
of an obligation because, as this Court is aware, the federal
rules ar® vary extensive with respect to discovery, and summary

15
judgment is much mor® difficult to get in the federal courts
than it is in -,:he state, court action.

And the federal courts

have a sufficient burden to handle litigation properly before
it.

They should not be. end d© not need to be involved in

extensive litigation which is properly th© subject of state
court action.
If, as the SEC and Mallis assert, st any time a
transaction touches securities, the transactions will be subject
to the federal courts, the scope of io:(b) and 10b-5 would be
extended far beyond what Congress intended.

Congress plainly

did not intsnd to include as part of the securities law the
release of collateral from a pledge,
Although, as Justice Stevens asked, w© do not believe
that there /as any rai.sropressntation—and there was no purchase—
nonetheless, before cm action can be instituted, -the plaintiff
must satisfy tbs statutory requirement in connection with
between the alleged misrepresentation and the purchase or sale.
There must >© a nexus or causation between the defendant anc.
the plaintiff.

In this case there was no such nexus.

Bankers did not know of their existence.

Bankers

accepted the pledge of collateral in August, 1970.

Its

customer redeemed the collateral on March 3, 1572.

The contract

had bean entered into to purchase the collateral on February
26th.

And everything had been locked in long before there was

any participation of Bankers at the closing.

There is no

16
possible way of imposing upon Bankers a duty to make any
disclosure when it. did not even know these people’s existence»
Bankers was only a passive participant in a transaction
organized by Arnold and Mallis.
The Court of Appeals sought to place a connecting
link by findine that Bankers was a seller by release of the
collateral and Mallis and Kupferman purchasers by virtu© of
the acceptance of the pledge.
intervening transactions.
Kates.

But this finding skips two

Bankers released the collateral to

Katas had sold the stock to Arnold and Fowler.

And

Arnold and howler may have pledged the stock to Mallis and
Kupferman.

There was no real connection in this situation.

A bank's re Lease of its collateral to its debtor is plainly no
representation of the» value of the collateral to any third
party nor ©: its bom fides 'bo any unknown third party.
A.j Judge Cardoza stated in Ultra Morris and recognized
by this Court i i Blue: Chip Slamps and Hochfelder, to hold

.

Bankers Trust liable in tills case would be to extend liability,
?•

in .an inciatormi:iafe amount, for an indeterminate time, to i:*
indeterminate class.

Congress did not so intend to expand the

securities laws.
Q

Jo 1 correctly read the Second Circuit opinion

as i*©lying on cases that arose chiefly under the '33 act
rather than the *34?
Mil. WEINER:

That is correct, sir.

17
C

But tilers is a much broader definition of "sale."

I'R. WEINER:

That is correct, sir.

Gentile and Guild

Films were both. '33 act cases, and they were both enforcement
actions.

In fact, ‘tills Court in National Securities stated that

there is a distinction between a 10b~5 action and an enforce­
ment action.

Inc that is what the Second Circuit did.

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Mr. Warden.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN L. WARDEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE MEW YORK CLEARING HOUSE ASSOCIATION, AS
AMICUS CURIAE
MR. WARDEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
T ie principal proposition that is decisive in this
case is the fact that, the words "purchase" and "sale" used in
the 1834 ac; are ordinary words

and

under the teachings of

this Court must therefore be accorded their commonly accepted

meanings.

Thosa commonly accepted meanings do not include

pledge transactions, that is, the pledging of securities or
other property :»r the release of a pledge.

Purchase and sale

involve the transfer of ownership for consideration.

A pledge

does not transfer ownership or a general property interest in
the pledge property.
I might say at this point in response to Mr. Justice
Stewart's question

earlier about the statutory definition,

18
that: does include pledge.

That is in the Public Utility

Holding Company Act of 1935.

And its inclusion there, we

submit, shews that when Congress wants to impose upon a common
word such ss "purchase" or "sale" an artificial or special
meaning to avoid repetition of a lengthy number of terms in
order to achieve the purposes of the statute, it knows perfectly
well how tc do so.
Therei is no indication in the legislative history or
otherwise that either the 1933 act or the 193^ act was
intended tc regulate credit transactions in the ordinary course
©f business on a face-to-face basis.

As Professor Loss has

pointed out in criticizing even the Guild Films decision under
the '33 act, federal law was not required to deal with
individual loar. transactions.
What Congress was concerned about was the regulation
of primary and secondary public securities markets of tills
country.

The statutes as drafted of course cover personally

negotiated purchases and sales, a point made by the SEC in its
brief.

And the.t is quite true.

both of them, co cover that.

The statutes as drafted,

That indicates that Congress did

not attempt to draw the line between public trading in
securities ind private purchases and sales of securities.

But

it did deal with purchases and sales, not with regulation

of

eradit tran;i act ions.
the Court ©f

Appeals and the SEC in its brief have

19
suggested that the ordinary meaning of purchase and sale should
be disregarded because of the statutory definition which says
sale induces a contract to sell or otherwise dispose of.
There is ncthing in the legislative history that indicates
that the addition of the words "or . otherwise dispose of" was
intended t© take away the very core of the meaning of the word
’'sell."

In fact, as we point out in our brief, a strict

definition of the word "sail,5' as obtained at that time,
involved the transfer of ownership for a price paid in money.
And the words "or otherwise dispose of" tend the definition of
the word "sail" to an exchange or barter transaction or, as
this case held in SEC; v. National Securities, a statutory
merger when there is in fact an exchange of ownership but not
for consideration in money.
To attempt to road anything more into those words
without any warrant in the legislative history iss t© engage in
construction by speculation.
Q

Do you think -there has to bs a transfer of title,

so to speak, transfer of ownership?
Mil. WARDEN:

Hr. Justice Stewart, I think that it

would probably oe sufficient if there were a purchase and sale
in the ordinary informal sense—that is, if I said to someone,
"I will sal.', you a part interest in the 100 shares of General
Motors that I own," and he said, "Fine, I will pay you a
thousand dollars for that" and I took it, I think that would be

20
a purchase or sale within the meaning of the statuta»

I do not

think that transfer on the books as a transfer agent or turning
the shares in to get two-fifty share certificates would be

3:@quir®d»
Q

Mr. Warden, what about the phrase "in connection

with"?
MR. \7ARDEN:

Ycur Honor, I do not think that anything

that was dene or alleged to have been done by Bankers Trust in
this case is in connection with the transaction of which the
plaintiffs complain.

That transaction, as Mr. Weiner pointed

out, was entirely arranged before -this closing occurred in the
offices of Ban}ors Trust.
I might point out that that aspect of the case is on®
of the aspects of the cats® that has raised very serious concern
in the banking community because it is quite a common thing
for banks,

?hieh aft* r all maintain conference rooms for the
/

purposes of closing, to afford the use of those rooms to their
customers f >r the conduct, of transactions.

And if that brings

one's activities into disputas that otherwise do not involve
the bank, what you have is &'i inhibition on the banks making
facilities

available to people, which doss not serve the public

interest in any way.
Q

Mr. Warden, i.a that quite correct?

I understood

Mr. Weiner to agree that w© must assume that the bank is
charged with a fraud her®, and w© have to accept that for

21
purposes of the case,

That is something more than making a

conference room available, is it not?
£ R. WARDEN s

It is not quit© clear for me in this

record—I happen to agree with Mr. Justice Stewart that the
facts in this case are rather hard to understand.

It is not

quit® cleas' whet it is that supposedly constituted that
misrepresentation or hew it was in connection with the trans­
action of which these plaintiffs complain, Mr. Justice
Stevens, ir that it is clear from the facts—and there are
more facta here than there ere in most motion-to-dismiss
situations, there weir© a lot of affidavits and there was a
state court record--that the transaction was entirely arranged
by the cases with Fowler and Arnold and that Fowler and Arnold
found these plaintiffs and that Bankers Trust Company had never
heard of them.

And then the closing occurred, and it is

alleged that ©cm® unknown kind of misrepresentation was made at
that closing; but the closing was a ministerial proceeding.
C

step right there.

Wait a minute.

Is it not

alleged—and do w@ not have t© assume it for the purpose of
decision—it may not ha proved ultimately—that at the closing
Bankers Trust made a fraudulent misrepresentation?

Let us

assume that fox purposes of decision.
MR, WARDEN:

That is what the Court of Appeals

decision—
Q

So, that is different from just making a

22
conference room available.
MR. WARDEN?

That is what the Courtof—ho, but I

think that dees indicate, Your Honor—-you are quite right.
That is what tlia Court of Appeals decision says, and this
Court must assume it.

But I do not think that that is entirely

different from the point I was making because talk of that
kind is pretty cheap and once they are in the conference roam
and these transactions occur and instruments are passed
i

across the table, it is very easy for someone to ellege—-and
this allegation, by the way, three years after the state
court complaint was dismissed, the allegation of misrepresenta­
tion made in tide ca;:@ is made on information three years after
their case has been ihrown cut of the state court.
C

Mr. Warden, it may be a very weak case, but that

has nothing to do with the legal question we are supposed to
decide.
MR. WARDEN^

Proceeding from there, we do have to

tion with.

Whet is that misrepresentation and how could it be

in connection with?

Either Bankers Trust would have to b©

considered .a seller—and the Court of Appeals handled that
problem by saying that the release of the pledge was a sale
and with

no further explication at all.

And all the release

of a pledge is is the performance of a duty imposed on the
bank by law upon payment of -the local.

Or somehow there would

hav© to b© a finding 'that Bankers Trust was an aider and
abettor, and this Court has expressly reserved in Blue Chip
Stamps the question of whether there is any civil liability for
aiding and abetting under ,10b~5.

One or the other of those

bridges would have to ba crossed in order to make this mis­
representation that this Court must assume existed—-I quite
agree.

the complaint but not on the basis that there was not any

This gigantic fraud before you were talking

about f how much of that is involved in the litigation now

regards their action in the state court, it has been dismissed
as against Bankers Trust Company.

"Your investment."

"You are advanced $156,000 ... - .iX

"Your participation in the trade."
And finally "you will be reimbursed."

31

A lean presupposes that it will be repaid.

But

nowhere in that letter does it say by whom.
X do not think that any member of this Court would
grant summary judgment against Arnold and Fowler on the theory
'that he renaivsd the loan from Mallis or Kates.

It seems to

me that if they did not borrow the money, that neither Mallis
nor Kates was i lender"-and X think it is too early to conclude
what their condition was.

Certainly you cannot conclusively

assume that they were lenders rather than participants in the
trade.
Let us assumes for a moment that they were lenders.
If, as fchir Court has said, the starting point for the
determinati .on of standing to sue under Rule 10b-5 is the
statute anc the statute say? that a form made—and I quota—
"in connect ion with"—close quote—a sale is the trigger for
a 10b-5 liability.
Of course there was a sale here.

The reason that

the case is perhaps a little confusing is because it is
sandwiched in l>a tween the release of on© pledge and the
creation of another pledge.

But the pledge to Mallis and

Kupferman was simultaneous with the purchase by Arnold and
Fowler, if indeed they were the purchasers.

I draw your

attention to the fact Arnold, when he signed the purchase
agreement, sigrad it as attorney—that is, in a representative
cap aeity.

32
There could have been no sale except for the fact
that Mallis anc Kupferman came with the money, through their
representative of voursa, to a closing.

At the closing their

money was expended, and the sale took place.
Q

Mr. Hauser, the sale you are describing now is

the sale from Kates?
MR. HAUSER:
Q

Yes, sir.

MR. HAUSER2
conclusion.

I do not necessarily defend that,

I do know that somehow, somewhere*--I do not knew

exactly when—-where fraudulent securities are pledged to a
pledge®, I know that somewhere there comes a time when the
pledgee has standing to sue for violation of Rule 10b-5.
Mr. Justice Rehnqvist asked & question during the
course of Mr. Weiner's argument, What would happen if a not®
was given and stock given beck in exchange?

And Mr. Weiner—

my time is up.
C

I would be interested to hear what you were

going to sty ©a that.
MR. HAUSERs

And Mr. Weiner responded that there

would not is assy answer, that 'there is no—that -there would be
no occasion to go to a 10b-5 remedy.

But suppos©, for example,

that the net© itself was a forgery and the fellow had sent
along his collateral and. now denied liability although
conceding that he had sold the stock for whatever purpose.

36

The bank would bo foreclosed from serving on the debt but they
would not fcs foreclosed from serving on the 1Ob-5, and it is
not a fax’fetched possibility.
Q

Your position, I take it, is that you can rely

on the sale from Arnold to Mallis and the misrepresentation
mad© by Bankers Trust was in connection with that.
MR. HAUSER:
Q

Positively, specifically.

That would protect the new pledgee or not?

Could the new pledgees recover too?
MR. HAUSERs

Yes.

The plaintiffs are the new

pledgees,
Q

Yes, I know.

Q

If they are the buyers.

You said that you do

not need to hold that, they are buyers at all.
MR. HAUSER:
Q

I said that—

Let us assum® that they are not buyers, that a

pledge is nit a sal® or a purchase.
MIR. HAUSER:
Q

Yes.

So, the new pledgee is not a buyer, and he did

not get the stock from a seller.

But Bankers is not. a seller

either, but it .takes a misrepresentation in connection with a
sale.

The new pledgee can recover?
M31. HAUSERs

Yes.

I say that the sale which the

pledgee caneratjs with the use of his funds is sufficient to
supply the statutory requirement of in-oonnection-with the sale.

The release to Kates by Bankers Trust of the

But analytically once Bankers Trust

was satisfied as to the legal terms of its contract with Kates,
it is arguable that that release should not b@ deemed a sal®.
That is not of concern in this case, and that is not an issue
we think that is before this Court.

And then we have now a third theory to support

Analytically I would submit that that is

Q

I knew.

HR. PITT:

I think you hava already submitted it.

I would like to explain why, if I may.

Before it occurred, in connection with the misrepresentation
mad© to Mallis to pay over funds sufficient feo accomplish the
purchase and upon which he was induced t© rely on the invest­
ment value of the securities that served as collateral for the
loan transaction, if there was fraud—as this Court must
assume, based on the procedural posture of this case—then
Arnold and Fowler, in pledging th© stock—I am sorry—Mallis
and Kupferran .In taking the stock were defrauded, based on 'the
investment value of that stock.

It matters not that prior to

that Kates could givo it to Arnold and Fowler.

MR. PITT:

Your Honor, as I understand the procedures,

what occurred hare w.as that Judge Pollack instituted a motion

Mr. Pitt, I take it: from what you have said

that it wov Id not hav© made any difference to your position
whether there had ever been a pledge to Bankers and released
by Bankers; is that correct?
MR* HITT:

No.

Although I think when this cas® is

tried, on® or fdio allegations that the plaintiffs appear to
be making js that Bankers, realising it had-a defective sat of
securities as collateral, was anxious and deliberately mis­
represented the value of that stock so it could get out of its

44
MR. PITT;
Q

That is precisely our position.

Bankers Trust could have held the securities in

safekeeping, rot having ever received them under a pledge.
MR. PITT:

Analytically that would not affect ‘the

allegation of fraud in this casa.

I quite agree.

Indeed, if

I may assert what wethink the issue is, w© would assert that
when a person is deceived into parting with money in exchange
for an interest in securities, that is precisely th© type ©f
situation io which the federal securities laws' anti-fraud
protections ware intended to apply.

We have articulated that.

In certain cases

45

we have exempted pledge transactions where they would other™
wise be induced within the definition of a sale.

Indeed,, th®

petitioners take comfort, surprisingly to us, from our Rule
16a~6 in which w@ specifically felt the need to exempt a
pledge from th© operative term 55sal©" for purposes of that
rule so as not to encompass those pledges in that special
limited circumstance.

But otherwise we have taken this

position consistently sine© fcha 1950s.
Q

Is there anything in the legislative history

of eithesr act of ’33 or “34 that supports your position that
a pledge is a sale?
HR. :?ITT:

If there is something specific on pledges,

I must confess I am unaware of that.
Q

However—

Th® hearings that led up to those acts were

very extensive, and they dealt with all sorts of problems
relating to securities.

It would be curious, I would have

thought, not to hav© gotten into the business of lending money
and putting up collateral if Congress had intended to deal
with it.
MR. PITT:

Your Hcnor, I had occasion be for® coming

here today to review our amicus brief in th# Superintendent of
Insurance case where this Court expressly held that not only
shareholders but creditors war© specifically within th©
intending nt of the
anti-fraud.

Securities

Exchange

Act protections for

And in our brief wa did cite legislative history

46
which was r&thsr diffuse,

l cannot tell you that there ware

express references to pledge transactions.

But it talked about

the value of securities held by banks , th® value of securities
held by insurance companies,, the mass of loans that were
utilized.

And I would point out to the Court that Section 2

of th® Securities Exchange Act talks about making and preserving
th® investment decision of investors reasonably complete and
effective from anti-fraud provisions, so that I do not think
there is any question that the Securities Exchange Act covers
any situati on in which there5 is an investment intent and an
investment interest.
:

think it. would be anomalous to suggest that when

someone puts up $156,000, largely on the reliance on the
underlying value of securities, and then takes possession of
those securities, that that does not constitute an investment
decision tl at phis Court in National Securities talked .about
in terms oi the definition of sale and in Blue Chip talked
about in terms of th© limited coverage of some of the exemp­
tions this Court has applied more recently.

Mr. Pitt, in that connection, this transaction

is quite extraordinary.

It is vary rare that private

individuals' lend this sort cf money.

Th® Securities Acts ware

concerned primarily, I had thought, with protecting
unsophisticated investors.

Hers we are dealing primarily with

banks and lending institutions, by definition sophisticated

47
investors.

The acts cartainly were not designed primarily

fc© protect them.

I suppose you would agree with that.

MR. PITT:

If I may, I have two responses to that.

First, of course, I guess this case is ample evidence of the
fact that not only sophisticated investors find themselves in
this position.

But, more importantly, I think this question

and your prior question focus on what the legitimate concern
of the Securities and Exchange Commission is.

And that

concern deals with the fact that when securities ©re pledged,
the next step is that those pledged securities can be
foreclosed upon.

They become distributed in the marketplace.

The enforcement actions that we referred t© have shown that
organized crimes and many individuals are using pledge
transactions as a means to circumvent our rules.
C>

In addition—•

If foreclose and if the securities have not

been registered, they are subject to the provisions of the
act of 533.
MR. PlTTs

Some of the cases we have had have had

knowing schemas in that direction.
and not just victims.

Banks may be participants

In addition, I think it fair to point

out that although the banks this Court has bean faced with
today assart that: they would- not like the protections of this
act., there are many cases ir. which banks themselves have sought,
the protections of section 3.0(b) and Rule lGb-5 in theca kinds
of situations.

There ©ra smaller banks and there are larger

48
banks, but many of them, including feh© Exchange National Bank
in a billion collar transaction in an opinion written by
Judge Friendly recently, where the protections of Section
10(b) and lule 10b-5 were eagerly sought out by banking
institutio, is.

I understood—

Banks in this situation are going to b©

defendants, nos plaintiffs.
MR,

PITT:

In this particular situation I agree

with Mr. Justice Powell that this is a very unusual situation
where the bank is alleged to have made an affirmative
misrepresentation.

I grant you the record is weak, and I

grant you idle fact that on trial this case may not prove out
at all.

That is not our concern at this juncture.

that if we are to make a statutory determination that can have

for the governnent, the* Commission in civil enforcement
actions, and the Justice Department in criminal actions, that
hopefully some poor pleading, if that is in fact the case hare,
will not upset an important statutory protection that we think
needs-Q

Mr. Pitt, did I understand you t© say to

Mr. Justice Powell that there was not any case authority for
your positi on?
MR. PITT:

No, no.

If I said that, I apologise.

I

thought I was asked whether there wera specific references to
pledge transactions in the legislative history.

As to a

specific reference to pledge transactions, there are—I am not
aware of any.

As to loan aid credit agreements and the

importance of providing the protections of the securities laws
in this context, I think there is ample legislative history.
Scan© of it is cited in our .£uperintendent of Insurance amicus
brief before this Court.

I think this Court's decision in

Superintendent of Insurance amply supports that conclusion,
particularly footnote eight -on page 12 of the reported decision.

How long have the courts hold that a pledge is

a sale?
MR. I ITT:

Consistently, with on© minor exception,

sine© we commenced raising this issue, which started in the
lat® 1950s.

The Second, Fifth, Seventh, and Tenth Circuits have

all acknowledged that pledges are sales.

•1R. PITT;

Under both acts.

the Fifth circuit had an

erroneous interpretation of of a

limitation as to when a pledge could be a sale.

But it is my

understanding that these circuits have held that at least as
to the '33 act--and I am not sure but I think in on® case as
t© the 834 act, the Dolnick case that we cite in which we
alleged a

.Ob-5 violation, that under the "34 act as wall.
::f I may in that respect, this Court has said in

Mr. Justice Marshall's opinion in National Securities, as well
as in the slochfelder decision, that the interpretation of th©
"33 and '34 acts should be construed in pari materia because
they war© loth complimenting ends toward a comprehensiva
scheme of i.egulation of th.© nation's securities trading
activities.
