ORAL ARGUMENT Gl? iu WARREN SIEGEL• ESQ. ,
Oil BEHALF OF TEE PETITIONER

MR. SIEGEL i

Thank you.

Mr, Chief Justice, and

may it pies®© th** Court*.;
The fr.-.ctag ©f this case are relatively simple.

They

aris e out; c.?. th-n 3@ara Chula Vista, store, which is located

south of Sa» Diego.

The; store ia a fre-.s-

standing starts, v>r * part: of the shopping center, surrounded
02

three - L(

js

by a parking lot: and public . tr sts

walks, on a fourCi side by

t-

3a-

block wall separating th© comrar-

cial property front private residences.
In Ocfcobor of 1973, representatives of the Carpenters
Onion appeared tt the store and demanded of the- store manager,
Mr. Oclio?, fh?*t Sears rameve its employees from doing work
which ths Union considered to b® within the carpenters* jurisdiction, and either obtain carpenters from a licensed contrac­
tor, who would obtain those carpenters from, the union hiring
ball, or, in the alternative, that the store manager should,
sign what was called a short form contract with the union.

Ochoa indicated that he would get back to fixe

Apnors'Xi'tly, for come reason, he did not.

The unio»

then plexv d pi.dfec.hs on the private property cf Soars, Roebuck
and Cotapat/y? signs indicating simply that they wore sanctioned

QUESTION;

Mr. Siegel, does the record show whether

Sears wr a swanbor of the Building Trades Council?

M::. -IIEGEI-;

The record dc;-,s not show that, Your

QUESTION:
MR. 3Ti30rv-:

Or tliat it signed the master agreement?
Ko. Soars, hewever, is not? but I C’G

If it had bean so, the

X -.:X:.c, would h&va had other alternatives, such as

arbitrati

provisions and so on.

But: Sears would ha.ve had,

also.
In any case* ttie pickets v/era requested to leave,

It*, appeared

they did leave after .* a

while fo:c a, vary short time, apparently sows phort© calls w;^
a” fa; they than re appeared on in© property and indicated tfc.ey
would not,

•?r.vr. unless compelled to do so by legal process.
Soars: did not challenge the objective of the

picketing.

The signs themselves were not precise as to what

the jbje r ‘ vc;* wwiae, but the conversations had beforehand

Yes, Your Honor.

Tfe-i court has discretion to take oral testimony, but it*s highly
unusual to do so.
The issue, therefore, in this case is basically one
of tow p' -oosdurr; by which too rights of privata parties era
to bs resolved in a peaceful picketing situation.

While this

-riin a picketing contort, the same problems would of course
be existing in whether it’s handbilling or organisational
activities such as Central Hardware, solicitation activities ?
the st»1 basic profoloia a.visas in any kind of activity occurring
on privato property.
It* 3 the position of the Petitioner that the State
courv- si

■ !'■ have concurror., t jurisdiction with the National

Labor Halations Uo&rd to resolve these kinds of issues,
la many respects, the type of resolution that occurred
in this ■;iES,;s on s motion for an injunction is not unlike the

the Stats •©.V.siaeafcs of those torts# but undoubtedly haws to

Viewed in that content, 1th© type of issues that the-Stay.y court s s id rasolvs on an injunction notion, are no

MU-TAL ARGUMENT OF Ii. WARREN SIEGEL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SIN GEL:

7«as, Your Honor.

In. response to the question that I believe was staked

by Mr. Justice Whits, the problem wiffii tiia proposal of the
Board that Sears file a charge under 8{b) is „ of course, an I
believe I msntiched earlier, that that gees only to the objec-'
hive, it does not: deal at; all with tho location.

Bui; oven in this case, if th© Board had found some
ircpsrntios’ibXe objective, the union could simply have changed

that objective to & valid ©as, and we'd be right back where
we

Kisrbed new.
It ;* s ijit^res-fciag tc. note that both the Board &ud

lha union have conceded in the briefs that there are some

I don’t want to make this argument too lengthy by
arguing State law, because

1

de balievo that that — the

California Suprema Court had an opportunity to rssolvts the
issues of State lew raised by the union,

ks a matter of fact,

the statuto to. which they refer foecama effective January 1,
* 76; this esa® was argued, if my memory servss ma correctly,
before tea California Supreme Court in April of ’75. ’.she
California Supreme* Court decision was in September of ' 76.
If tr-si Court had felt coitpell-ad by any of the
arguments under State law th&t are raised now by the union,
it's to

assumed they would have resoled them.

Yes,
