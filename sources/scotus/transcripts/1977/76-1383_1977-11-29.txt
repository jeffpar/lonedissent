MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We’ll resume arguments

Mr, Martin, you may proceed,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS S. MARTIN, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT — Resumed
MR® MARTIN*

Thank you®

Mr® Chief Justice, and may

it plaase the Court*
When w® closed yesterday, Justice Rehnquist had
questioned whsthsr fee awards against sometimes indigent Title
VII plaintiffs would really dtetar enforcement, and son»© Title
VII plaintiffs am undoubtedly indigent and perhaps judgmentproof; many mom am not.

Title VII claims am brought not

only by incumbents and unsuccessful applicants, not only by
blue-collar workers but by executives.
We think that the threat of fee swards against their
personal property, however jcodest, *©uld be a substantial
deterrent.? and, more importantly, Congress thought that it had
this detew,i/i.i nfiaet because Congress authorized the swards
to deter frivolous or abusiva conduct,
This is also thu same bat;is that this Court has used
to uphold the American pile»

This Court said in Fleisohmann

th.it if defendants were forced to -- if plaintiffs were forced
to pay not only their own fee® but th® fee's of their opponents
when they loat,, i%u poor ralyhi b® unjustly discouraged from

24
bringing action to vindicat® their rights*

We think this is

not an abstract concern» the Lawyers' Committees for Civil
Rights» the ??MCP, based upon their experience» in their
briefs they conclude that ,v:?i ordinary awartl sf attorney's fees
against unsuccessful defendants would have a substantial
adverse effect upon Title VII enforcement.»
We think
QUESTIONs
MR* MARTINs

Against unsuccessful plaintiffs*
Against unsuccessful plaintiffs» yes»

This is surely inconsistent with Newman and we
don't think it*s impossible — it's impossible that Congress
could have intended that*
concerned

Especially since Congress was

that those plaintiffs would be unable to pay thoir

own fcas» and that's why they passed the statute*
Humphrey said*

Senator

the purpose of the statute is to help poor

plaintiffs bring meritorious litigation»
QUESTIONS
MR* MARTIN:
QUESTION*

Mr. Martin.
Yes » Mr. Justice Powell?
Could a distari yt court» in the exercise

of its discretion» consider the fact that the prevailing
defend, sat was, say, a «heritable corporation» non-profit
cc rpor&tion?
MR* MARTIN;

1 think tha district court could consides

that, the district court has a grant of discretion» it's a wide
grant, and the courts have considered those* kinds of factors

25
ia fii© caesa that; are — whsra th@ good~ faith standard has
been applied»

I don’t think it’s a straits jacket for district

courfc consideration„
It would also have to consider, though, Hr, Justice
Powell, th« status of the plaintiff, and the fact that the
plaintiff, for examp1®, might be tli© EEOC, which has an
obligation to advance Titia VII law, it might be a poor plaintiff,
and it has to consider this fact that awarding an attorney’s fists
might deter future Title VII litigation.
So it has discretion, it can consider that factor,
but it has to consider it within tbs whole scop® of. the purpose
of Title VII, to eliminata discrimination in this country in
employment.
QUESTIONS

In your view, could th© district court

also consider the sis;® and financial condition?

Many of these

defendants ars> quit© small,almost .‘line-par businesses.

MR. MARTIN;;

I vihink th© district court could

consider that, Mr. Justice Powell,
insider these factors $

but it should also

afevt. before Congress was an amendment

t® eliminate fee awards against small businesses — that was
*72, and

ii

*f

and Congress rejected

that amendment„
Befcsss Congress wear; many amendments to eliminata
th© coverage of Title VII from small businesses j nevertheless,

Congress refused to withdraw Title ‘711 coverage from small

26

businesses»

If w® had a course of dealing in which district;

courts cons latently refused ft© award fees , award fo©s in
cases brought against small businesses, it; might effectively
insulate

these small businesses from Title VII coverage

and therefore reverso the ‘I»?© decisions mad© by the Congress,
one, to cover them, and, two, not to allow mandatory fees in
such C&8©$U
Sc

and let ray also men felon that in this case,

Christianssburg was a company in 1970 which had 230 employees,
and that was almost tan times the minimal amount that was
needed for Title VII coverage®

So it wouldn’t be dispositive

in this c&s®, regardless *
But, to answer your question, I think the district
court has discretion to considar fehss® factors, but it has to
measure all this against Titi® VII*a purposes*
QUESTIONS

It isn’t so much your answer that

confuses m®, I thought it w«s your position that a district
court should ©jcercis® its discretion to impose attorney's

upon plaintiffs only on a finding that the action has been
1

uc '/• i.n bad faith or vexatiously,

And I should think the

; ©£ the defendant would have nothing whatsoever to do
with that criterion*
MEo MARTINr

wall, the indicia associated with the

£zm award are bad faith, v®2c&tiousn*3s, ©t cetera, so I think
i;, the normal ca&e# &s a uo:; •'rula, that foes should not bss

2?
awarded, abseut those indicia»
Whether Congress meant to preclude the court from
even considering the fact that, in the exercise of its
discretionaxy grant, that, the employer was a small employer,
doesn't appear from the legislative history except to the
extent that Congress decided to cover those employers and
rejected amendments that would haw given them mandatory
awards ,
QUESTION: Well, then —
MR. MARTIN:

I ihink it's unlikely that it will ever

it shouldn't be dispositive,
QUESTION s Well, should it be any element in the
district court*a decision as to whether or not to exercise
its discretion to assess attorney's fees*

According to your

~~ carte-inly whether or not a claim is brought in bad faith
or vexatiously has really nothing to do with how big or how
snail or how rich a plaintiff or defendant is,
MS. MARTINt

That's right.

think that should be the normal rul-a*

That should be *•*•« X
All I'm suggesting is

that that rule seems to bo in the nature of a guideline, as
it —» at least as articulated by tfc.a Courts of Appeals.
Th© Courts of Appeals hairs not articulated whether
in fact the consideration which Mr. Justice Powell suggests
should be excluded.

They haven't £< rid it should be excluded,

and therefore I don't think, to affirm this case which just says

20

that the indicia associated with award ©£ bad faith and
vex&tiousnsss, w© na©d to necessarily d©al with that problem
©f what

of whether you should or should not considor it.
QUESTIONS

But your answer implied that if not —

either it should be, or, in any event, if; could permissivaly
be included, which is inconsistent with what you say in your
brief, as I read your brief.
MR, MARTINs Well, I think that the Courts of Appeals
decisions which we cite in our brief suggest •»- in United States
Steel they suggest the possibility of taking into consideration
economic factors, for example.

And that's how the standard

has bean applied.
As I say, Mr, Justice Stewart, in the normal case,
you're absolutaly right, fees should b© -**
QUESTION*

Well, I'm not suggesting it.

MR. MARTIN; Right.
h

In ths normal case fees should

dsrtled in ti'-w absence of th*sse Itdieia, of bad faith or

frivolousness.
QUESTIONt
test.

That's

And, as you say, should be the sole

submission in your brief, ag I understand

it at least.
MR, MARTIN;

That should •— that should be the sole

test, but •»- and thos^ art whether -« again, the grant of the
statute is discretionary.
QUESTION; Right

29

MR* MARTIN:

Diecretd.ona.iy fee award.

Okay.

And

the indicia, a guideline associated with that, are these tests
that we have suggested.
QUESTION; So you do now concade that in addition to
whether or not the action was brought, in b&cV faith or
vexatiousXy, that the court might psrmissively consider other
element® in deciding whether or not t© assess attorney's fees.
MR. MARTIN;

I think it's hard to look at the

legislative history «id the language of the statute and say
they can exclude it, I think it should never be dispositive*
QUESTIONs

Nell, if things ar© in equipoise except

for that element# that it's going to be dispositive.
MR. MARTIN;

I think it* 3 — I think it would be —

wall, them could b® a case, Mr* Justice Stewart, and all I*m
saying is that, looking at the .legislative history, 1 cannot
exclude th© possibility that the coart could take that into
consideration*

I think that th© normal# th© indicia associated

with »;«rd of attorney's £ee should be vexatiousnass end
frivolousness, normally*
TImt'fi th© best s^iswsr that I think X cbm givs to
the question*
QUESTION;

Well, that is a somewhat different

position than the position takm in your brief, as I understand
it*

Am I wrong in my understanding of your brief?
MR* MARTIN;

Well, 2 —- ih© brief’s position is that

I

30
the

th® good-faith standard should b© applied as it's

applied by the Courts of Appeals new. And if you look to those
decisions I'm suggesting to yon that they do not say* they
have not reached th© question of aseluding this kind of
eonesrn altogether.
And I am suggesting that what they have reached is
that, the normal indicia associated with th© award should be
those criteria.

That's all that's necessary to resolve this

case, and that's th® point that we mad® in our brief. That
in
in this kind of case,/the normal case, th® vexatious and
frivolous rule should be dispositive.
QUESTION: Well, we're not a poli.ee court her© to
decide each cae-a on sort of an ad hoc basis,

bn© of our

functions, perhaps the primary function, is- to give some
guidance to th© courts and lawyers of this country, and in

ti&s area it's quite important, it seems to me, to — what
we'r© asked to do is to sat th® metes and bounds of th© area
within which a district court should exercise its discretion.

MR. MARTIN;

Yes.

Well, my answer to •»*» let mm

£ >y that my answer, and maybe this will do it, I don’t think
it should over fo@ dispositive.

And I think that the criteria

should fee the vexatious rule.
QUESTION: Than, if it. should never b® dispositive,
ilan it's asi impermissible element, you would agree, wouldn't
you?

31
MR* MARTIN5

Oh, th©n I would agree with you.

QUESTION! Do you think your responses to Mr* Justice
Powell and subsequently to Mr* Justice Stewart fall within
the framework of the Fourth Circuit opinion in this case?
MR* MARTINt

I think it dome, Mr* Chief Justice.

Tii@ Fourth Circuit rejected a rule that would depend upon an
ordinary fe© award to plaintiffs or that would depend upon
reasonableness alone*

And locked to the urdtad States Stgel

rule, which was dependent upon the indicia of frivolousncss,
meritless and vexatiousaess *
QUESTIONz

Now, th© statute talks in terms of

prevailing parties, doss it not?
.MR* MARTINS

QUESTION:

It &SS.
New, Senator Humphrey and the other?!

debating this matter or. the Floor had no difficulty in singling

out plaintiff, defendant? what conclusions should be drawn from
the fact that Congress used the tarr. K partyt! rather than
"plaintiff", ‘’prevailing plaintiff"?
MR* MAMTINe

1 think the conclusion that should be

dr-.:,wn is that Congress did net want to exclude prevailing
defendants from ®ver receiving an attorney’s fee award, and
in order not to exclude them, <-md to provide for a disincentive
for frivolous litigation it included the "prevailing party"
language*
Mr* Jus tie: Powell asked :-ae yesterday whether Congress

32
would ever us© this language sad nevertheless mean that there
should b© two different standards.

But, in fact, Congress has

repeatedly done exactly that, in the statutes which are pointed
out in the Lawyers’ Committee brief, for example, ranging from
consumer protection to marina pollution; Congress used exactly
this prevailing language and nevertheless meant to apply two
different standards, on© for the plaintiff end one for
defendants,
tod, mom importantly, Congress relied upon this
interpretation in the 5 75 Civil Rights Attorney's Pees Act,
that was comprehensiva legislation, intended 1» parallel the
*64 Act, Congress tracked the language of 706(H) and explicitly
stated that fees should only bn awarded where the plaintiff*»
suit was frivolous, vexatious or brought for harassment
purposes,
QUESTS OH:

You say Congress explicitly stated teat*

Did you mean that literally?
MR» MARTINs

I maan in both tee House and Senate

fcoporfe, which are set out in the brief.

Not in the statute.

They used te© same language in th® statute as they did in
706 (k), but. they mad© cirri? in th© legislative history, as
explicitly as one cor Id, teat th®y Intended fees only to be
awarded on this standard»
QUESTION;

Mr, Martin, wfc-m you answered Mr, Justice

Rowell * s qimstion abeat th® chinract ar of a corporate defendant,

33
charity or small business, were yo-; answering with ref«rasae©
to fee awards against the

plaintiff or fee awards against the

defendant?
MR. MARTIN:

Fes awards would ordinarily be made in

favor of a successful plaintiff, according to Newman vs. Figgis
Park.
QUESTION:

You*re saying 'that in a plaintiff's

claim for a fee, a successful plaintiff's claim for a fee, the
court might dony them ©a the ground that th© defendant
MR. MARTIN:

No.

Fee awards are — under the

Nawmam rule, they are ordinarily mads.
QUESTION:

Well, what was your answer to Mr* Justice

Powell, then?
MR. MARTIN: Well, Mr. Justice Powell asked, I -think,

whathar the ©vart in its Usoration could ever take into .
consideration these other
QUESTION;

factors.

When -the defendant had prevailed, that

was in my question.
MR. MARTIN: When the defendant had prevailed?
QUESTION:
MR. MARTIN:

|

Yes.
Right.

I thought you had just asked me

whether if the plaintiff prevailed.
QUESTION:

Well, i was not clear whether you

answered it in the oc-ntse:-st of defen iant or plaintiff prevailing.
MR. MARTIN:

No.

No, and I —

34
QUESTION:

And you’re saying that: when a d?j! fondant:

prevails, a factor that would tend to justify a foe would b©
that the defendant was a charitable corporation or a small
business?
MR, MARTIN:

Maybe

maybe •this way? you know, if

— I think this is a part of it
QUESTIONs
MR® MARTIN:

Or did you depart from that answer —*
I'Jhen the EEOC brings — on© of the

criteria might be whether it's an unreasonable action®
By th© EEOC*

Okay?

And sore court might, in deciding whether EEOC

was unreasonable in bringing the suit, look at the question of
whether, you know, th® sis© of this defendant®

You know, as

Mr. Justice Stewart said, that would b© inconsistent with the
whol© thrust of what thes® £®o awards were supposed to do.

Bat that, you know, it has bean dons? .and that's really what I
was saying®
QUESTION:

Mr* Martin, you've been subjected to very

skillful cross-examination by *iy brothers —
MR® MARTIN:

I haves, Mr* Justice Powell®

QUESTION:

v>hat I want to ask you now is:

Are

wo to understand that the answers you gave m@ still stand?
[Laughter. ]
MR* MARTIN:

I think Mr. Justice Stewart ha® skill­

fully brought m© to th© point, where I have to say that if th©
court teak into consideration the z> izo of *■*** as X was trying

35
to statae

gesis rally — tha size of th© company, it would be

inconsistent; with what Congress did in covering the company
and refusing a normal award of attorney's fees.
QUESTION:

Is it your view that the court acts in

its function m & court of equity when it makes this judgment?
MR» MARTIN:

It acts, according to this — Title

VII is an equitable statute, in general, that’s right»
QUESTION:

That is right»

And are you now saying

that a court of equity cannot consider the size or character
of a defendant who has prevailed in a Titi® VII case?
MR» MARTIN* Well, I think, Mr» Justice Powell, —
QUESTION:

And if so, what in the statute gives you

any basis for making that argument?
MR. MARTIN:

All right.

'Sia only thing that — and

I think this is what Mr. Justice Sts swart said — is that the
indices that wer© associated with the fee award, when Congress
articulated what its purposes were, were indices of bad faith
ar.d frivolousr-ass, I think Congress did not include in that
small business and other kinds of concerns.

Thaio is discretionary £«© award language.
Appeals, in applying this rui.s, h v

Courts of

looked fc© the other language,

to th©s*a other concams, but, to ths extant that they would
upset a case in equipoise, -than I think that would be incon­
sistent with Congress’s purpose.Justice -Stewart has suggested here»

I think that’s what Mr.

36
The double standard that the covurt found o© h?s — the
dissenting judge found to be unfaia, we think is not unfair
because this statute was

" has a particular purpose:

to implement Title \n.X*s policies.

it’s

And plaintiffs slid

defendants are differently jitutted with respect to those
policies.
And while plaintiffs have an enforcement role,
defendants do not have that enforcement role.

Therefore,

Congress could have precluded prevailing defendants from ever
obtaining a £©a award, bus it made a different choices

it

decided that in cases of unjustified abuse, of frivolous
litigation, fee awards could be mads.

And that’s the balance

that Congress struck, and that’s the balance that we think
should b© sustained.
QUESTION:

You seem to disparage the adversary

system somewhat in that rasptmsa, Mr. Martin.

Isn’t, it tine

function of tin® advocates on both sides to present their
positions’. vigorously, to se.« that ultimately the intent, of
Congress is carried out?
MR. MARTINs

QUESTIONs
|

con

It. certainly is, Mr. Chief Justice).

Now, if the defense then, if the defendant

>revents an inexperienced or ill-advised or indolent

judge from going too far off the bestan path, hasn’t h©

p.^rfeymad & faction consistr,r.t wit.i the, administration of the
Act?

37
MR. MARTINs

I think h© I"as, and -- but what our

problem Is is not deciding what would be & good ruin but what
Congress was thinking about when it passed the '64 Act.
Its concern was providing an incentive for plaintiffs? it had
raised no concern of providing an Incentive to defendants.

It

probably presumed the defendants have enough incentive to
defend against Titia VII litigation.
And so, interpreting what Congress said, as opposed
to what might b®, you know, considered to be a good rule.
Congress seemed to intend the good-faith standard.
QUESTION? But, if your last answer is correct, they
simply would have given attorney's fees to prevailing plain­
tiffs, period, wouldn't they?
MR. MARTINExcept that they had another concern,
and that ware to prevent frivolous sad abusive litigation.
Th«y didn't want this process to be abused, ;mfi that's why
they provided prevailing party for awards.

They have done this,

sr. I say, in numerous other statute*, including the parallel
lagislation of the *76 Act.
They had tr do this for another reason, Mr. Justice
Rshnquish, because costs would not b© allowed against the
|

United States in the absence — because of 20 U.S.C. 2412 ■—
costs would not be allowed against -Sha United States under
tb.a equitable rule.
So, to provida against —• to stop frivolous actions,

30
t© provido fees against th© United S'sates, they had to pass
til® prevailing party language»

QUESTION $ W©11, they certainly could have worded it
so thet; costs would be allowed against the United States, but
not attorney * 8 £©@s»
MR» MARTIN; But. they intended to allow attorney*s
f-aes e,gainst the United States, they needed the prevailing
party language to do that»
QUESTION;

Well, that's what I suggest, that your

answer to the Chief Justice's question is not wholly antis**
factory»
MR. MARTIN;

In what sans©, Mr» Justice Rahnquist?

I'm not sure I understand you»
QUESTION; Well, that Congress was seeking to
encourage private litigants to presacute but net to encourage
to ths same

taxtenfc meritorious

defenses to be: mad®.

MR. MARTIN; All I c«sn say is that, in the legislative
history there are only about four statements.

On® is Senator

Elraphr^y's statement:, saying that wa want to encourage private
litigation.

And that’, was mad© when ha introduced the emendmsnt

to the bill.
QUESTION;

How would you read the statute if the -™

without referring to these various remarks on the Floor?
MR. MARTIN:

If there, w-

would then look h© the purples

no legislative history, I

:>£ Title VII, and the statutory

39
scheme and the legislative history would sasm to bo to
encourage the elimination of discrimination»
I think what w© hav© is sosae remarks on th® Floor,
a legislative scheme which was designed, as 'this Court said in
Nawiaar.,

to encourage privata enforcement»

We have subsequent

parallel legislation in the *76 Act, we h&v® the same use of
similar language in other statutes by Congress,,

All 'those

indicators, w© think, point in the same direction»

That is,

that the Congress intended, whan it used -this language, to
sat up one rule for prevailing plaintiffs and the good-faith
rule for prevailing defendants»

That's our best estimate ©£

what Congress intended, biased upon ill these legislative

i: .dicate rs»
Thank you»
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Sturges, do you have

anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM W. STURGES, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR» STURGES;

Mr. Chief • Justice and may it please

the Courts
I £q,

few remarks,

Ficst of all, in respect to-

considsring the financial ability of the loser to pay, we
think that ia a matter that « district court can properly
considar* And if the plaintiff is j idgment-proof, or if the
dc;t£endr,nfe is judgmsnt-prc^f, certainly in that kind of a case

40
the court should ©xercisa its discretion not to award attorney's;
fees to the winning party „
In respect to the quastioa asked by Mr* Justice
Powell in respect to a non-profit corporation, that is a
matter again, we would submit, in the district court's juris­
diction and discretion and undoubtedly the — a variety of
facts would have to be taken into considaratiori as to whether
an award should be made®
Secondly, the law as it existed before Title VII
©r th® 1964 Act was passed, provided attorney's fees to a
party if that party was subjected to a vexatious ©r bad-faith
s uit or defenss*
QUESTION $

That was in th a absence of any legisla­

tion, to qualify*
MR. STURGES t

y

That was z i the absence of any
he.t #as the inherent equitable

-<e, “fovr Etmox,

power of the federal courts*
QUESTIONS

Under the American rule*

MR. STURGES e
ibet the

Row, there ?>>;« some 40 or 50 statutes

Congress has passed

ti®y provide

attorney's

1..:. respect to attorney's fees, and

<■'■■■-.*? ip & vuciaty of cases, sometimes

to the prevailing party, soma times

so the injured party,

ssmeti:.aes to th© prevailing plaintiff,

sometimes,

ir*

exceptional

casas, sometimes otherwise*
We

submit Shat there

is x„ ■> holding by this Court or

41
by stay court; th&fr. when Congress passes; a statute ©.Hewing
attorney's f@©s to the prevailing party, that if th@ —» either
party had acted in bad faith, they would have been precluded
from receiving attorney's fees, absent. & provision in the
statute which would allow it»
Indeed, this Court, in Newman v. Piggie Park Enter­
prises , in its Footnote 4, stated:

If Congress' objectives

had been to authorise th© assessment of attorney's fe&s against
SefisftdleiitE who reads completely groundless contentions for
purposes of delay, no new statutory provision would have been
necessary.

For it has long bean held that a federal court may

m&rd counsel fees to a successful plaintiff where &. defendant
h as — a defence has been maintad "in bad faith, vexatiously,
wantonly, ox for oppressive r©:isons”«
And the Court again &loptei this same language in its
Alyeska Pipeline Service farnp&nv case, in which it said'the
Court, in referring to this sene footnote in Newman, where it
/■

stated*

The Court r©aeonad that if Congress had intended to

authorise £e©?:. only e?n the basis of bad faith, no mm legisla­
tion would have been required in view ©f the history of the
bad- fa l th exception.
So we way t© the Court end argue that, it was not
necessary for the Congress to pass 5b.es statute allowing the
"**•* including "prevailing parties” i.u the statuta, in order to
«ward attorney's fees for bad. faith, either to the plaintiff

42
or th® defendant.
QUESTION:

Mr, St,urges , could I Interrupt, for just

a moment?
MR# STURGES:
questions

Yes, sir#

I was reflecting on your argument last

night, and you said that '/our position now is that the same
rule should apply to both sides, whether the plaintiff or the
defendant prevails? is that right?
MRo STURGESs
QUESTIONs

That’s correct, Mr. Justice,

Now, does that mean that »- which of two

positions do you therefore taka?

That th® rule of Plggio Park

has baan changed for successful plaintiffs, or that whenever a
defendant wins, itia . afandant shoul d routinely get fees; from
tin® p 1 ainti f f’?
MR# STURGES i

X a ay that, the rule enunciated in

P.lggio Park should apply ■:* da fan \;?ats as wall as to plaintiffs.
C • ••

.H: i.o that in the aorm&l case of a defendant

•foat wins, he automaticelly gats fees, unless there’s soma
©xcdptional reason for denying him fees?
MR, STURGES:
QUESTION:

That is our position, Mr# Justice.

1 just wanted fco b@ sure#

MR® STURGES:

Now, in respect to public policy#

In

the Nawman case, this: Court nnslogi-s®d tha successful plaintiff
a,
say

carrying tnc. burden of & private attorney general.

We would

**" and that was based, in part, on tha statutory

43
history, what: litti® thera is to encourage such litigation*
As we h&'-m pointed out, that statutory history also discourages
unmeritorious litigation*
And w© would submit to the Court the analogy that the
successful plaintiff, if you will, is similar to the private

defendant*•
Lastly, we would suggest to the Court that the
legislative history ©f the *76 Attorney’s Fees Act is in no
way relevant to what the Congress in 1964 intended in respect
to the provision under consideration here, and wa submit —
I believe it's Footnote 36 in th© Teamsters ?. T.I.M.E. case,
as further support for that position*
