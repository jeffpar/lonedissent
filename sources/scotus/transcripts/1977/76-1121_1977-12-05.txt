ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORTON J. COME* ESQ.* ON BEHALF
OF PETITIONER* NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD
MR. COME:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case is here on certiorari to the Second Circuit
which by a divided vote denied enforcement of the Board's order
against respondent union Writers Guild of America* West.
Three petitions to review the Second Circuit's judg­
ment were filed, one by the Board* one by the three major
television broadcasting companies* androne by the Association
of Motion Picture and Television Producers.
This Court granted the three petitions and consoli­
dated them for purposes of hearing and decision.

I am speaking

for the Board and will ba followed by counsel for the other
two petitioners.
This case presents another facet of the problem which
was before this Court in Florida Power , decided in 1974.

There

the Court held that the union does not violate section 8(b)(1)(B) of the National Labor Relations Act, v rhi eh make s it an

5
unfair labor practice for a union to restrain or coerce an
employer in the selection of his representatives for the pur­
poses of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances
by disciplining supervisor-members for crossing a picket line
to perform rank and file struck work during an economic strike
against the employer.
The question here is whether a different conclusion
is warranted where the supervisor-members are disciplined or
threatened with discipline for crossing the picket line to
V

perforin their normal supervisory duties which include grievance
adjustment or collective bargaining.
How,- the relevant facts are these:

Respondent Writers

Guild represents for collective bargaining purposes writers who
prepare scripts for motion picture and television firms and
who are employed by the major television broadcasting companies
and by various member firms of the Association of Motion
Picture Producers.

I will refer to both of them as the

employers.
The employers also employ producers,, directors, and
story editors to manage and carry out the production of the
films.

The producers, directors, and story editors, when

acting as such, are supervisors as defined in section 211 of
the Act, and. they also represent the employers in the adjust­
ment of grievances and in certain situations producers also
represent the employers in collective bargaining.

6
Some producers», directors and story editors known as
hyphenates, and those are the people that we are going to be
concerned with in this case, have writing capabilities and are
at times employed as writers to prepare
other creative writing functions»
of the Guild.

scripts or perform

These hyphenates are members

The Giuild represents hyphenates only when they

are employed as writers, not when they are employed as producers,
directors, or story editors.
Most hyphenates have personal service contracts with
the employers covering their employment as producers, directors,
or story editors, and indeed under these contracts they are
often represented by other labor organizations.

Thus, the

collective bargaining agreements between the Guild and the
employers provide that a person is not subject to those agree­
ments when he is employed in a non-writing capacity, for ex­
ample, as a producer, director or story editor.
The agreements further provide, that producers,
directors and story editors can perform certain editorial
writing services known as "(A) to (H) functions" without becom­
ing a writer subject to the agreements.
Now, in March of '73, the Guild began a strike against
the employers in furtherance of their demands for new contracts
covering writers.
until July of '73.

The strike continued against seme employers
A month before the strike started, the

Guild distributed strike rules to all union members, including

7
the hyphenates.

In addition to prohibiting writing for struck

employers, the rules prohibited all members, regardless of the
capacity in which they were working, from crossing union picket
lines.

The strike rules also prohibited union members from

working in the future with members who violated the strike
rules.
The Guild, through a series of special meetings with
hyphenate members and phone calls to particular hyphenates,
emphasized that the strike rules wouM apply to hyphenates
working in any capacity and that they would be subject to dis­
cipline and blacklisting if they crossed the union's picket
lines.
The Guild also refused to allow any members, includ­
ing hyphenates, to resign from member ship before or during the
strike.

The employers demanded that the hyphenates continue

notwithstanding the strike and the picket lines to perform their
duties other than as a writer under their personal service con­
tracts.
Many hyphenates crossed', the picket lines to perform
their norma! supervisory and managerial functions as producers,
directors, and story editors, including grievance adjustment
and collective bargaining.

They performed no writing work

which would otherwise have been performed by the striking
writers.
During and after the strike, the Guild filed internal

8
union charges against 31 hyphenates for crossing the picket
lines;

10 hyphenates were subsequently convicted by union trial

committees; they were suspended or expelled from union member­
ship and were fined amounts ranging from $100 to $50,000«

Later

the union membership voted to reduce the penalties of 9 of the
convicted hyphenates and proceedings against other hyphenates
were held in abeyance pending the disposition of unfair labor
practice charges which meanwhile were filed by the employers
with the Board.
i

The Board, with Member Fanning dissenting, concluded
that the Guild violcited section 8(b) (1) (E>) of the Act by dis­
ciplining and threatening to discipline the hyphenates for
crossing the picket line to perform their normal supervisory
duties, and a divided Court of Appeals, agreeing with Member
Fanning, denied enforcement of the Board's order.
Now, wa start with Florida Power, which holds that a
union’s discipline of one of its members who was a supervisory
employee can constitute a violation of section 8(b)(1)(B) only
when that discipline may adversely affect the supervisor's
conduct in performing the duties of and acting in his capacity
as grievance adjuster or collective bargainer on behalf of the
employer.
To discipline in Florida Power was found not to have
this effect because the supervisors ware disciplined for cross­
ing the picket line to engage in rank and file struck work.

Q

Indeed, the union did not discipline those supervisors who
merely performed their supervisory duties when they crossed the
picket line.
The Board submits that when a supervisor member is
threatened with discipline or disciplined for crossing a picket
line to perform his normal supervisory or management duties,
and they include grievance adjustment and collective bargain-,
ing, such discipline may adversely affect the supervisor's
conduct in performing the duties as grievance adjuster or
collective bargainer on behalf of the employer even though the
union's motive is not to influence a particular

grievance or

collective bargaining decision but merely to secure adherence
to its picket line.
There are two reasons for this conclusion.

One is

referred to or can be called the deprivation theory, and that
is this, as the Administragive Law Judge, whose decision was
adopted by the Board pointed out, if the hyphenates had
succumbed to the Guild's threats of discipline, as many of
' them did, and had refused to cross the picket lines, the
employers would have bean deprived of their chosen representa­
tives for the performance of management functions, including
grievance adjustment or collective bargaining for the duration
of the strike, no less than if the union had directly pres­
sured the employers into removing those representatives from
those duties.

In short, the effect of the threat of discipline

10
would have been to have deprived the employers of their chosen
representatives for grievance adjustment and collective bargain­
ing.
QUESTION:

Mr. Come, isn8t it reasonable to infer

that the picket line itself may have had that effect?
MR. COME;

That is correct, Your Honor.

?However,

where the picket line alone is in the picture and the super­
visor decides that he is not going to cross that picket line,
the employer is deprived, of the selected representative because
of the free decision of the supervisor to honor or not to honor
that picket line.

However, we submit that where the supervisor

honors that picket line as a result of threats of union dis­
cipline, the element of restraint and coercion on the part of
the union has been added, and it is up to the union to dis­
entangle that he would not have crossed but for fclvat restraint
and coercion, and we submit that the union cannot do that.
Moreover, as the Board added by the citation of its
earlier decisions in Hammond Publishers and Triangle Publica­
tions, insofar as those hyphenates who defied the union and
were disciplined or concerned, there is a reasonable likeli­
hood that the discipline would have a carryover effect and
ciffecfc the future performance of grievance adjustment and
collective bargaining functions because here, unlike the per­
formance of

rank and file struck work which was involved in

Florida Power, the duties which the supervisors were performing

11
ware similar to the functions that they would be performing
absent the strike.
I don't want to cut in any farther into my colleagues'
time.

They will develop these theories in further detail.
Thank you.

Mr. Keaton.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY J. KEATON, ESQ., ON BEHALF
OF PETITIONER, ASSOCIATION OF MOTION PICTURE AND
TELEVISION PRODUCERS, INC.
MR. KEATON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
In the time allotted to me, I would like to cover
primarily two contentions in this case, the first one being
the contention of the Guild, the respondent herein, that in
some ways the work done by the hypenates, whatever you might
call it, and they do not call it strike work in their brief,
they call it rank and file work, without using the work strike,
that in some ways that work puts the work on a par with the
work that this Court held in Florida Power to be of a nature
that section 8(b)(1)(B)

should not apply.

The second point that I would like to address myself
to is what Mr. Come referred to as the deprivation theory in
somewhat more detail.
As to the first point, the three-point argument being
made by the Guild at this point, it comes down to this:

Number

12
one, while there conceivably is no evidence in the record that,
any writing of scripts was done by any of the people who ware
disciplined, they might have done writing?

number two, that

the (A) through (H) functions are to be construed as bargain­
ing unit type writing; and, number three, that even if the (A)
through (H) functions are not bargaining unit writing, they
are not managerial functions and that therefore the performance
of such functions is not akin to grievance related type work
and therefore the supervisors could be disciplined.
Now, taking the first point, merely as to whether or
not they might have done the writing, the fact of the matter is
that the Guild very well knew or at least very wall could find
out whether they were writing.

There were 15 strike rules in

this case which provided specifically prohibition against
writing.

Not one of them was invoked by the Guild, not a

single one.
One of those rules. Rule 8, is very significant be­
cause it specified that any writer, in order to protect him­
self — and that includes, of course, rank and file writers —*
to protect himself against future charges should fils with the
Guild his scripts that he had completed at: the time of the
strike in order to make quite sure that he would be able to
prove that he had not written during the strike.
Respondants*s Exhibit 6, which is not in the printed
transcript, which is a multicolored script, it is in the

13
record, will illustrate to the Court that it is very easy to
tell from a script when the final script was written and when
the changes were made, and therefore it would have been quite
easy for the Guild to tell whether or not such work was done.
Now, turning to (a) through (H), the Guild analogizes
in {A) through (H) to the Shelton Construction Company case,
the Shelton Pipeline case, where an 8(b) representative was
held not immune frcstu discipline because was operating equip­
ment which he had also operated at times when there was a labor
shortage.

But that case is precisely the opposite from this

case, because in that collective bargaining agreement, operat­
ing equipment was covered by the contract by so many words,
and then contract said in the case of an emergency or for pur­
poses of training, a supervisor may operate the equipment, not
so for

(A) through (K).

The contract specifically states in

section 1(b)(1)(A) and in 1(c)(1)(A) that the performance of
(A) through (II) functions by producers, directors or story
supervisors shall not be covered by this agreement and shall
not cause them to become writers hereunder.
So what you really hava is not collective bargaining
unit work that may be done by supervisors but work that is not
covered by the contract which if you perform it does not make
you a bargaining employee but which conceivably at times could
be performed by bargaining unit employees.
But new comes the most important point, namely the

14
argument that (A) through (H) supposedly is not managerial.
Let’s examine what

{A) through (H) is and, if the Court please,

I will give examples of it.

Some of them are in the record

and some are just common sense.
The first (A) says cutting for time.
that mean?

Now, what does

It means deleting a portion of a movie or a tele­

vision play in order to make it shorter in order to accommo­
date the time for the screen.

That is certainly a management

decision.
(B) is bridging.

That means

tying up two pieces of

the .movie, if you will, due to the elimination of the inter­
vening piece.

(C) is a change in technical or stage direction

— need I say more, direction.

(D)

is the assignment of lines

to existing characters due to cast changes.

The -writers don't

make those assignments, managers do.
(E) axe changes for legal clearances, done by execu­
tives at the request of the legal department, according to the
transcript, the testimony of Mr. Mittleman, pages 1307 through
page 1311, and Association Exhibit 9.
Now, the casual minor adjustments in dialogue covered,
under (F) , and then there was an example given;

Medical

terminology used by a writer which happens to be erroneous, so
they call a -.doctor, the lector says the diagnosis is all wrong,
and they change the name of the illness from one to another,
again don® by management.

.15

(G) are changes necessitated by unforeseen events.
An example is in the transcript at page 204 to 205,

What

happened was that they ha.d to change the names of streets from
New York City to Los Angeles.

And (H) , finally, by its own

language is clearly managerial work, it is instructions, direc­
tions or suggestions, oral or written, to a writer.
All of this work is about as managerial as it can be,
and the interesting distinction is that if you take a look at
the lowest level of bargaining unit work, namely the so-called
rewrite, that is carefully defined in the agreement and you
can get motion

picture credit for doing a rewrite.

You can

do all the (A) through (H) in the world without getting any
motion picture credit, there is no credit for that.

But on a

Now, the Writers Guild contends here as a last resort
on this issue that -QUESTION:
through (H).

Could I ask one question about the (A)

You say it is all clearly managerial.

MR. KEATON:
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.
And you have described it.

Is it also not

true that it is all clearly managerial work that ha3 nothing
to do with the selection of an agent to do any grievance or
coilec tiv e bar gain ing'?
MR. KEATON:

That is not entirely correct, Your Honor.

We are not. relying on the (A) through (H) functions as

16
establishing the 8(b)(1)(B) capacities of these supervisors.
But any one of the steps taken in (A) through (H)

that i

described to you might very well lead to a grievance and indeed
a grievance of a writer because most of them involve scripts.
To illustrate, Your Honor, if I may, writers have
the privilege in fact a contractual right to watch the screening of the final cut of a movie and if at that time the writer
finds that the picture did not come out the way he hoped it
would, he may very we 11 raise a grievance with the associate
producer who made the cuts on the picture and may say to him,
"I don't like the way you did this ending, you deleted a
hundred feet of footage that I had in there which was my
beautiful idea, and now it is a sad ending instead of a happy
one. "
QUESTIONs

Mr, Keaton, that is a very, very broad

implication in your ansi^er to my brother's question.

Any

action of any foreman anytime, anywhere in any industry can
lead to a grievance on the part of the employee, and is that
the test?
MR. KEATON:
test.

Ho, Your Honor, that would not ba the

But if the person who is making the decision also has

the authority to adjust that grievance, that would be the test.
QUESTION:

He doesn't get that authority pursuant tc

(A) through (H) , does he?
MR. KEATON:

No, sir, ha does not.

He does it by

1?

virtue of his position.
QUESTION:

Ansi he adjusts the grievance which he

creates by his own -—
MR. KEATON:

He might.

He might very well.

And I

might also say that the physical change of a movie cutting, for
instance, might occur because the editor has made the cut, who
is a person -who is not a hyphenate.

There are no hyphenate

editors in this case.
Now, to turn briefly to the deprivation theory, if I
may, I think that the Guild — first of all, I think we should
dispose of an item, if it is of concern at all here, namely
the contention of both the Guild and the amicus that there was
in some way nothing that could be brought before this Court.on
the deprivation theory because it was not part of the Board's
decision.
In the court below, in the District Court of Appeals,
in its reply brief, the Guild argued exactly the opposite.

At

page 4 of their brief, the Guild stated, just as it did, the
Board's brief writers, the association seeks to justify the
decision below in this ease on the basis of the rationale of
labor-decided Board decisions.

There was

only one basis upon

which a violation was found here, namely that the Guild's
discipline kept the employers from utilizing the services of
8(b)(1)(B) supervisors during the strike, not as a subsequent
decision in other cases, they rationalised that the discipline

18
would carry over to the supervisor's future 8(b)(1)(B) func­
tions.
The Guild is now arguing exactly the opposite in
this Court, that this was not the basis of the Board's decision
and only the future function was the basis.

The answer? of

course? is both wrong.
Now? in terms of the question of whether or not the
statute was violated here? I don't think we have to get in­
volved with such things as Oakland Mailers, because what we
really have is a rather

simple proposition.

We have people

who were told, unlike in Florida Power, if you coma to work ir
any capacity, including of course 8(b)(1)(B) capacities, we
will fine you, w® will discipline you, we will expel you, and
you can't resign.

All of those things were said.

And to answer further the question that Mr. Justice
Stevens asked, of Mr. Come, I don’t think that a union can fall
back on what might well be a legal picket line if at the same
time the picket line is up it is threatening people and coercing
people and telling them if you do cross our picket line, wb
will punish you, any more than this Court would hold it legal
that if a union has gone to an employer and said to him, we
would like you to cease dealing with another employer, that
the picket, line that was subsequently established would in some
way be immunised because the employer may have acted because of
the union's voluntary request rather than the illegal secondary

19

boycofct line under 8(b) (4) (B),

I think their analogy is very

.much the same.
Now* what you really have here is very simple.

The

union in effect is saying you must not asa these supervisors,
it means
nated.

we eliminate the supervisors, they cannot be desig­
If they cannot be designated, you have a clear viola­

tion of the statute itself and you have the violation just as
surely as if the union, had put up a picket line to prevent the
hiring of a supervisor or the use of a designated representa­
tive of the employer for purposes of collective bargaining.
is precisely the

It

case that Congress was talking about in the

legislative history, where Senator Taft, I believe, said don’t
send us Mr. Y or Mr. X — Mr. Y is being excluded in this case.
Now, the union
fact, the AFL-CIO does.

would

argue that ha could resign.

In

That is not so, they ware not allowed

to resign, in effect they were reactivated.

In the decisions

of this Court, even under 8(b) (1) (A) — and I. recognize that
8(b)(1)(A) is not applicable because the supervisors are not
protected — but the decisions of this Court under 8(b) (1) (A)
themselves indicate very clearly that even there discipline
would not be lawful if there is not any right to resign at
some point.
Since I must reserve a little time for rebuttal for
Mr. Cesae, I would like to conclude on a couple of points.
By reactivating and keeping the supervisors captive

20
members, in effect the employers were given two choices, either
don't use the supervisors during the strike, in other words do
not designate them as 8(b) (1) (B) representatives — and there
was plenty of work going on, the record is full of it, scripts
were being written, scripts were available, scrips had been
finished, lots of them in the record, and no other union was on
strike — either do not use them during the strike or if you
do, we aure going to expel thsm, fine them and punish then, and
you will never be able to use them again because nobody will
work with them, and you can’t produce something without the
writers.

Those were the choices given, in effect, to manage-

inenfc.
And the other point I wanted to make is that the
only way that, the decision of the Court of Appeals can be
sustained is if this Court were to add to the statutes the pro­
vision that this section shall he inapplicable in the event of
a strike.
Thank you.

MR. BAKALY:

that.
QUESTION:
MR, BAKALYs

All right.
Now 1st me talk about the adverse carry­

over theory of the Board for liability of the union in this

22
case, and that theory started with Florida Power.

In Florida

Power, the Court said that union discipline of one of its
members who is a supervisor employee can constitute a violation
of 8 (b) (1) (B) only when that discipline may adversely affect

the supervisor's conduct in the performance of the duties of
and acting in his capacity as grievance adjuster or collective
bargainer on behalf of the employer.
Now, that is where we start, and in this case we have
tremendous conduct on the part of the Guild, which Judge Moore
and the Second Circuit characterised as in terrorem conduct to
adversely affect the supervisors in the future.

Not only are

we talking about the fines of up to $50,000 or the threats, or
the refusal to accept resignations, but, more importantly, the
blacklisting,

AM to understand the effect of that on an

associate producer or a producer whose whole livelihood is
because ha gets the right creative people to work with him,
that if he wants a writer to work for him in the luture in
another production and he understands that because! of what he
does now, that writer is not going to work for him, that black­
listing threat has a tremendous effect upon the producer in
the future.

It has an effect upon the director.

It has an

effect upon all of these hyphenates, and‘to say that this type
of conduct does not engender fear in that supervisor so that
in the future when that union or any other union says to him
to do something that the union wants, he is going to think

23
that if he doesn’t do what the union wants, he is going to have
that same kind of punishment again.
This adverse effect certainly affects supervisors who
in fact are just writers, and we have evidence of some of the
supervisors adjust writers grievances, it would affect super v.isors who adjust grievances of other employers like directors,
because people don’t just think about one union and what it
does.

What one union can do, another union can do.

And if

the Writer's Guild can cause writers not to work with an
associate producer, then the directors guild can cause
directors not to work with an associate producer, and the
director is vary much concerned with that.
There is one bit of testimony in the record that just
cries out.

Mr, Crichton, who was talking with Mr. Furia, the

leader of the Writers Guild and the President of the Writers
Guild, and Crichton is saying, "I told him finally that if
push came to shove, 1 would rather be thrown out of the Writers
Guild than the Directors Guild, since I felt my future was
really more with the Directors Guild.”

And he explained that

it wasn’t that simple, that "if I were expelled from the
Writers Guild, I couldn’t work as a director in the future,
work solely as a director because members of the Writers Guild
could not work as directors for me, as a director, if I have
been thrown out of idle Writers Guild.”

That kind of threat

has to have an adverse effect in the future.

24
And that adverse effect,

that carryover effect does;

pertain to the selection of a representative for grievance
.handling and for collective bargaining.

It is not just a

question of identity, as the Guild would have us believe.
What an employer wants, he wants a supervisor who
will do what he says, ha wants a supervisor that will be tough
with the union per Imps, if that is the way that particular em­
ployer wants.

Well, if the union by this kind of discipline

and threats can change chat supervisor from a tough supervisor
to a supervisor that agrees with the union, then they are in
effect changing the identity.

Employers don’t really care

whether a supervisor has black hair or red hair, -'.hey don’t
care about that.

They care how he is going to pas;form with

the union, and ie by the threats you change that *—
QUESTION:

Did the Court reject this theory in

Florida Power or not?
MR. BAKALY:

The Court of Appeals — the Court in

Florida Power, no, I don’t believe the -QUESTION:

The carryover theory?

MR. BAKALY:

No,

In fact, I believe that that is

where the theory was originated, from the language that I said,
Mr. Justice White.

You were in the dissent in that case, but

the majority did definitely state that when the discipline may
adversely affect — they are talking .about the future there,
and that is the carryover effect.

That was not rejected by the

25
Court in Florida Power.
Finally, one of the arguments that is relied on a
great deal by the Guild is the argument that after Florida
Power, the loyalty of a supervisor--member to his employer is
irrelevant and without merit.

And that language comes from

the Court that says that it — it is a statement in Florida
Power about loyalty not being a part of the remedy that
Congress intended for the solution of the conflict or this
problem.
Assuring loyalty is really one of the only purposes
for 8(b)(1)(B).

Why else would the Court put in 3(b)?

would the legislature put in 8(b)(1)(E)?

Why

It is perfectly

logical to have grievance handlers as the most senior person.
Why not let collective bargaining decide that?
Well, the reason has to be, as I sale earlier, that
one of the things that an employer wants other than ccmpetenci
and an articulate supervisor, but he wants one that is loyal
to him, he wants one that will do what he wants done in the
handling of grievances in the collective bargaining.
So loyalty is still a part of 8(b)(1)(B).

Wow, the

respondents say that the only solution is to keep supervisors
out of the union.

That solution really proves too much, as

the Court again said.

Where are instances, there are instances

where a supervisor does — where a union does violate 8(b)(i)~
(B) by adversely affecting the supervisor's conduct.

So the

26
Court in Florida Power recognizes that there can be a situa­
tion where a supervisor-member is disciplined and that -that
adversely affects his conduct»
We submit that this is that case, that with this
kind of in terrorem conduct; as Judge Moore said, certainly
these supervisors would be adversely affected and these
employers would be deprived of their grievance handlers and
collective bargainers.
I will reserve the rest of my time for Mr. Come on
rebuttal.

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JULIUS REICH, ESQ., ON BEHALF
OF RESPONDENTS, WRITERS GUILD OF AMERICA, WEST,
INC., ET AL.
MR. REICH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
From this Court’s statement in Florida Power that, the
conduct in a case called Oakland Mailers was at the outer
periphery of what the Labor Board could proscribe, or may be
at the outer periphery of what the Labor Board could prohibit,
it —
QUESTION:
MR. REICH:
QUESTION:
MR. REICH:

We just assume that .it was -That's right.
We said we may assume without deciding.
That's right.

it may have been at the

outer periphery.
QUESTION:

It may have been within the outer peri­

phery.
MR, REICH;

It may have been within.

But from the

fact that this Court said that it may be within the outer
periphery, the Labor Board has drawn the conclusion that it
was approved by this Court, not that it was questionable.
t

QUESTION:

Well, it was permissible for the Board to

conclude within the meaning of that language that it was with­
in it.
MR, REICH:

But what it has done from that, Mr.

Bakaly said that we have to start with Florida Power.
the Board has done is ended with Florida Power.
done is they have taken

What they have

Florida Power and limited it to its

exact facts and that is all.
which

What

They have taken a statement

says that supervisors may be disciplined for performing

struck work and ended it there, without any regard to this
Court's rationale to the decision, without any regard to the
legislative history, without any regard to the statutory
language, and all of that went to she?,'? that 8(b)(1) (B) has a
specific purpose.

It was directed at curbing union interfer­

ence with the selection by an employer of his representative
for purposes of collective bargaining or adjusting of
grievances.
Now, this Court made an extensive survey of the

28

legislative history in Florida Power, and the Board neither in
this case nor in any ether cases that followed Florida Power
has gone to the legislative history to see where Florida Power
should leave»

In fact? vrhat this Court said and what the

legislative history showed is that while employers may have
certain expectations from their supervisors, unions too have
certain expectations from their members, despite the fact that
those members may also be supervisors.

And in order to give

the employers some relief from this conflict of loyalties, to
help the employers to resolve this clash of expectations,
Congress in 1947 simply took supervisors out from under the
provisions of the Act by section 23 and also absolved employers
a the necessity to deal with supervisors or their repre­
sentatives bargaining for them.

QUESTIONS

And conferred upon the employers the ab­

solute right fco hire supervisors who were not union members
and not to hire supervisors who are union members, isn't that
correct?
MR. REICH:

That's right.

The employers thus have

at this point the ability to make their own decision to have
their supervisors not be members of the union and thus not
subject to that discipline.
Now, the Board has corae up with two theories in sup­
port of the decision in this case.

One of them is the depri­

vation theory, which the Board — in which the Board says that

29
if a supervisor has 8 (b) (JL) (B) functions,, that is has the
right to bargain collectively or the right to adjust
grievances, then it is sufficient if the union deprives the
employer of the services of that supervisor regardless of the
fact that the supervisor is not performing 8(b)(1)(3) functions
while he is at work.
Now, with respect to those 'who were actually dis­
ciplined in this case, those were exactly the people who
worked.

The employers were not deprived of the services of

those persons* so they clearly were not restrained and coerced
in the designation of those people who worked.
The Board, to overcome that in its reply brief says,
yes, but they may be afraid in the next strike to work and
the employers will be restrained and coerced in the designation
of their supervisors in the next strike, and therefore it is a.
violation of the Act.
Well, the clear answer is that they can ask those
supervisors to resign before the next strike cones up.
QUESTIONS

Mr,, Reich, is it fair to say that the

argument you are now making really, you are not

helped much

more in it by Florida Power £ Light than your opponents?

You

are saying that Florida Power & Light went off on a fairly
narrow ground and you want to get back to a broader ground?
MR. REICH:

I think that is correct. Your Honor.

think that the Court in Florida — I think that the language

I

30
in Florida Power is helpful to our position, and the position
is that we have done nothing to interfere with the selection of
the representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining'
and there is nothing in any of either of the two Board theories
which establishes that there would be a violation in this
case.
QUESTION:

But what about Mr. Bakaly’s point that

if this man wants to progress up the ladder he is in trouble
in the future?
MR. REICH:;

Well, that man whom Mr. Bakaly mentioned

Mr. Crichton, is one of the people who is working, so evidently
the thra ts didn’t affect him.

And in the Appendix at A296,

Crichton was one of the persons who was charged with a violation of the Act which indicates that he in fact did work.

I

assume that that is the point that you are getting at, that
is that
QUESTION:

The point is that if he doesn't partici­

pate here to the full extent that the Guild wants him to, then
if he is promoted to another job, he still can’t hold that job
because the members of the Guild below him won’t work with him.
I thought that was his point.

list, the ——

QUESTION:

Fellow employees

That

Well, why is that disconnected from the

right to employ him in a better job?
MR. REICH;

Well, it has no connection.

First of

all, the rule was rescinded during the strike, so that there
was no such mandatory rule.

An announcement was made that

people can deal with hi?;n as they wish, just as in any strike
situation, if a person crosses the picket line, they suffer
perhaps the enmity of their fellow workers.

But if that is

discipline, then this Court has held in cases dealing with
the reasonableness of discipline by unions, that that is a
matter for state court concern.

They certainly could have gone

to a state court and. get a declaration that that discipline
should be erased from the record.

So we are not really con­

cerned at this point with the reasonableness of the discipline.
And if it is not a violation of the Act to begin
with, we don't have to get into this question of whether or
not the discipline was reasonable or unreasonable..
QUESTION;

Mr. Reich, could I go back to a point you
If I understood your argument correctly,

you said that the discipline may have been ineffective because
some of the people went to work anyway and may presumably have
gone ahead and done their collective bargaining functions, ergo
there could be no violation.

I find that, argument, unless I

32
missed something, I find that totally unpersuasive.

Supposing

they blatantly said we will fine you $50,000 if you go into
this plant and adjust a grievance or engage in collective
bargaining, and the fellow want ahead and did it anyway, he
wasn't deterred.

It would be a plain violation, wouldn't it?

MR. REICH;
QUESTION;

Well
How can you test it, by whether the man

is in fact deterred by the coercion or not?

The test has to

be whether there is coercion, doesn't it?
MR. REICH:

Okay.

That goes to the second theory of

the board, the carryover theory.

first of all, my answer is that I would concede that a person

adjusting grievances, a representative who goes in to perform
those functions that are listed in 8(b)(1)(B) may not be dis­
ciplined by the union.

Well, I am only repeating what the Board

The Board takes the position in its reply brief

that while the threat of discipline didn't deter these people
who actually went in and performed their services and there­
fore the deterrence theory doesn't apply in this strike as to
then, the Board takes the position that in the next strike they

will bo deterred from going across the picket line, and that
is how the deterrent theory comes into play.

34
MR, REICH;
QUESTION;

Okay,
Weil, I still don’t understand what your

response is to the Board's argument.

You have identified the

Board's argument and you have said, well, they really want to
work but then you have admitted that is not a response.

What

is your response to their deprivation theory?
MR. REICH;

I'm sorry.

If they are at work, regard­

less of the threat of fine, it would be my position that the
employer has not been restrained and coerced under the depri­
vation theory.

The employer

the Soar'd may have a good

argument if a supervisor is told that he will be disciplined
for performing 8(b)(1)(B) functions, the Board raay have a good
argument to show that he will be restrained and coerced, the
employer will be restrained, and coerced with respect to this
supervisor.
QUESTIONs

Would this bo another way of stating your

theory, that on the deprivation theory the Board should have
made a finding that somebody was in fact deprived from going
to work, that there is an absence of a critical finding?

Is

that really what you are arguing?
MR. REICH;
work — excuse rue.

There was no finding that anybody went to
There was sufficient evidence that people

did go to work despite the threat and that they adjusted
grievances while they were there.

We have examples of stunt

people and actors whose grievances wore adjusted.

35
QUESTION:

Conversely* there is no finding that but

for the discipline* somebody additionally would have gone to
work and adjust©! some grievances he never adjusted?
MR. REICH:
QUESTION:

There is no such finding.
Is that your real argument, that they

didn't prove the deprivation?
MR. REICH:

Eat one point that I want to make is that

if a particular individual would have crossed the picket line
for the purpose either wholly or primarily of adjusting griev­
ances and collective bargaining, then it would be a violation
in our view if the threats kept him from going across the line.
But we don't have any such case here.

There is no finding and

there is no evidence to that effect.
QUESTION2

In other words, in short, your short answer

to the deprivation argument is that there was no deprivation,
period7
MR, REICH:

That's right.

Thank you, Your Honor.,

The Board says though that, the threat may have kept
people out and that that is a violation.

Thera was no evidence

in this case of anybody who was being asked to go across for
the purpose either in whole or primarily of performing
8 {b) (1) (B) functions, and the Board’s position, the Board's
answer to that is that so long as the employer invests its
representative with 8(b) (1) {B) functions, any work that the
representative does, any supervisory work, any work short of

36

doing rank and file struck work, any work that the employee
would have done would bs work which, according to the Board,
if as a result of a threat, the supervisor refrains from cross­
ing a picket line to perform his normal supervisory functions*,
the employer, without more, is deprvied of the representative
he has selected for collective bargaining or grievance adjust­
ment purposes.
Now, what this does is to simply make a shambles of
what this Court carefully told the Board it should distinguish,
the distinction between section 211 functions, which are super­
visory functions, and section 8(b)(1)(B) functions, which are
representative functions.

There is a difference between a

representative, as that word is use! in section 8(b)(1)(B), and
a supervisor, and the Board simply meshes them.
Now, Congress could have simply said in 8(b)(1)(B)
that the union shall not restrain and coerce an employer in
the selection of his supervisor, and then the Board's theory
would make sense, but it didn't do that.

It specifically said

a representative, a representative for only two purposes, and
this Court recognised that in Footnote 21 of the decision in
Florida Power.

It made it clear that there is a distinction

between the two, arid there is only one function, that of
adjusting grievances, which overlaps between section 211 and
t

section 8(b)(1)(B).
And the Board's argument proves too much.

There

37

would be no basis upon which# if the Court accepted the
Board’s argument that somebody with 8(b)(1)(B) functions could
go to work -- if someone with 8 (b) (1) (B) functions went, to
work and part of his work was that of doing rank and file
struck work# the Bocird would have to say in those c ir cum stance s
that the union can’t discipline him because — and can’t keep
him from going to work because a person with authority to
adjust grievances is being kept out of the plant# and that
would apply in the Florida Power situation# just as it would
apply in our situation.
We have a case of tha tail wagging the dog here. The
result is what the Board says is that all the employer has to
do is designate a person as its representative and that person

can freely go through the picket line and disavow his obliga­
tions to his union# despite the fact that he never adjusts a
grievance.

We had an example at page 13 2 of the Appendix#

for example# of a person who was asked# one of these super­
visors who was asked do you adjust grievances# and he said ”1
have the authority.”

Well# can you give me an example?

And

he said# "Well# 1 can't think of one# in the last few years
we’ve not had. any disagreements.”

But that person would be

entitled to protection under the Board's theory# just as well
as somebody who is there for the specific purpose of adjust­
ing gr i eva nc e s.
QUESTION5

You do not claim# do you# that the work

38
performed, by these supervisors who did cross the picket line
during the strike was struck work, you claim that it was rank

from disciplining persons in the performance of 8(b) (1)(B)

The

supervisors ware fchratened with discipline for crossing the
picket line, and the question arises as to whether or not that
threat kept the employer from having pr

t ] arsons with

8(b)(1)(B) functions.
Our reading of the threat to disciplina persons if

41
they crossed the picket line, in light of the minimal amount of
3(b) (1) (B) work that they had to perform, the example that I
gave of somebody who said that it had been years since he could
think of an 8(b) (1) (B) function that he performed, the impact
on a person who receives a threat is not that he is going to
be disciplined for performing 3(b) (1) (B) duties but that he is
going to be disciplined for crossing the picket line for performing non-8 (b)(1) (B) duties, and there is no finding here in.
this record that anyone was threatened for the performance of
or because ha did perform 8 (b) (1) (B) duties.
To conclude, the networks in this case, both in their
opening brief and their reply brief, made no secret of what the
case is about.

What they are trying to do is to get this Court

to give to them an advantage that they were unable to secure
through Congress, and that the Court should not do.

Mr. Gold.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE GOLD, ESQ., ON BEHALF
OF THE AFL-CIG, AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. GOLD;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Com* t;

In Florida Power & Light, Mr. Justice Stewart noted
that the Board’s view of section 8(b)(1)(B) had evolved to the
point that if

served as a "general prohibition of a union’s

disciplining supervisor"members for their conduct in the course

42

of representing the interests of their employer.”

I suggest

that, as Mr. Come made quite clear, the Board has continued to
hue to that view with one exception.

They now say that in a

situation in which the supervisor-member performs a substan­
tial amount of rank and file work, some of which is struck
work, that the union can discipline the supervisor.
We suggest that that analysis is no more responsive
to the statute and its legislative history than the Board po­
sition taken before this Court the last time this question was
here

because, as Mr. Reich indicated at the end of his argu­

ment, it. is our position that assuming that Oakland Mailers is
correct, namely assuming that the section doesn't simply pro­
tect employers against strikes against them but protects

supervisors? against discipline

for performing certain functions

for the employer, section 8(b)(1)(B) is given the full scope
that it can possibly be given so long as it is a violation for
the union to discipline the supervisor for performing
8(b)(1)(B) functions or because of the way he performs those
8(b)(1)(B) functions, but that the union has a privilege which
Congress did not choose to take away of disciplining super-™
visor-members for performing any non-8(b)(1)(B) functions.
We think that the line is that so long as the cause
is the way the supervisor per for is his '8 (b) (1) (B) function,
assuming as 1 said that Oakland Mailers is correctly decided,
the union commits a violation, .but that if the union's

43

discipline is based on the way the supervisor performs other
other supervisory duties or rank and file duties or the fact
that he crosses a picket line and thereby tends to undermine
the strike, that is outside the prohibition of this unfair
.labor practice.

At that point, the employer's option, again

to quote from Florida Power & Light, is to force the supervisor to resign from the union, thereby protecting his inter­
est, and we think that the source of this understanding is
basically on three different facets of the Act and its legis­
lative history.
Firs t of all, section 8(b) (1) (B) is far narrower
than section 211.

Section 8(b)(1)(B) protects employers and

the selection of grievar.ee handlers and negotiators, whereas

section 211 defines supervisor;! far

more broadly.

tions came into the law at the same time.

Beth sec­

If Congress wanted

to prohibit unions from disciplining supervisors, it would
have written 8(b)(1)(B) to say that it is unlawful for a union
either to discipline supervisors or unlawful for a union to
restrain csr coerce an employer in the choice of his supervisor
It simply said neither of those things.
Secondly, the legislative history indicates that
this provision created no stir in what was otherwise, as this
Court again has note:-! time and again, one of the most hardfought legislative conflicts of the post-war period, because
of the assurance of its sponsors that it had a narrow scope

44

and that scops basically was to perfect the collective bargain­
ing process by assuring that the union was not on both sides
of the table in both selecting its own representatives and
selecting' or having a voice in the selection of the employer
repr ea ant atives.
The more difficult and controversial issue of whether
to restrict the right of supervisors to be union members was
solved through section 14 and 2(11} and 2(3) in favor of giv­
ing the employer a privilege to keep supervisors out of unions,,
to fire supervisors who join unions and to refuse to bargain
with unions about supervisory units, even where the union had
majority support in the union, thereby reversing the decision
in the Packard Motor Company case.
It is not surprising# 1 would contend, that the
sponsors of 2(3) , 2(11) aid 14 did not choose to give supervisor'-members protection in law against discipline as super­
visors because they were at the same time stripping those
supervisor-members of all legal protection vis-a-vis the
employer.

I think that we, of course, have differed with many

aspects of T&ft-Hartley, but Sanator Taft was not the type of
man who would carry water on both shoulders at least that
blatantly.
QUESTION:

What if a member of the union who was a

supervisor crossed the picket line and does non-rank and file
work and the employer asks him or designates him to do

45
grievance adjustment and he says, no, I won’t do it, I would
he fired? and the employer says, well, I guess I must get
somebody else, and he says, yes, you must get somebody else?
Now, would your argument still go?
MR. GOLD;

Yes.

In. other words, v.Te — may I ask a

question about that, because under our position we couldn’t
discipline him for handling the grievance; if it occurred the
other way-, wa could discipline him, in other words he goes to
work and the employer says —QUESTION;

the union can discipline.

does supervisory work when the employer — end than he tells
the employer, by the way, I have been doing grievance work for

for handling the grievance.

It could fine him for doing the

supervisory' work other than handling grievances.
QUESTION;

Now, Mr, Gold, I don't remember and I

don't have before me your briefs

in Florida. Power & Light,

that is, the respondents brief, but it is asserted in one or
more of these briefs that you took the position in that case
that supervisors who crossed picket lines to perform 2(11)
work could not legally be fined by the union?
MR, " GOLD;

We did not take that position.

I have

gone back over the &FL-CIO brief and we simply didn't even
address it.

In the union's brief, the IEWfs brief, they

argued first that Oakland Mailers itself was wrong —

that way because under their internal union rules they did not
choose to discipline supervisors who did not do struck work,
so that was the only issue they posed.
QUESTION:

QUESTION:

All right.

But it is asserted in the

present case in the briefs that the position is taken by each
one of tie respondents in that case that the unions could not
permissibly discipline those who crossed picket lines in order
to perform what you called 2(11) work, i.e., just general
supervisory work, foremen's work?
FIR. GOLD:

Well, all I can say is that, first of

all, in support of that statement they quote a portion of the
transcript in oral argument of counsel for the union, and he
said assuming that Oakland Mailers is correct, unions can fine
individuals for performing struck work.
as a concession.

I don't regard that

Secondly, I have gone over our brief and

what they do is tax us for saying that by arguing the issue
presented by that case, namely whether unions can discipline
supsrviscrr: for doing struck work, we wore taking the opposite
position on - 2(11).
QUESTION:

MR. GOLDs

Right# and we believe that the theory of

your opinion in Florida Power s Light supports our attempt to
win this case# but we do not argue that we have already won
this case by reason of that opinion.

We are arguing that the

rationale# particularly the point made in your opinion that
8(b)(1)(E) is narrower than 2(11) and that the overall problem
of assuring that supervisors are loyal in performing non8(b)(X)(B) functions supports our view here.

QUESTION:

that you also were the author of# that is all I want to say.
We think that the 8(b)(1)(B) situation here is very much like
the 3(a)(3) case presented in American Ship Building.

There#

as hare# you have a situation whsfe Congress left something
to employers# namely

’ scipline even union members

49
so long es the basis for the discipline was not their union
activity? and, on the other hand, Congress in 8(a)(3) made it
unlawful to discipline a union member for union activities,
and the Board of course read 8(a)(3) to create a prophylactic
rule that an employer could never lock out, and the theory of
that court opinion was that where Congress leaves the
privilege on the one hand and creates a prohibition on the
other, the Board can prohibit activity motivated wrongfully but
canet prohibit all activity which has an adverse effect on the
ground that that is necessary.

And I would suggest that here

too, if Oakland Mailers is correct, the Board has moved to pro­
tect the supervisor in performing 8(b)(1)(B) functions to
assure that a union cannot discipline the supervisor for the
way he performs that function or for the fact that he is per­
forming , to go the next step and say it is necessary or else
employers will believe — I mean that supervisors will believe
that they can be disciplined for 3(b)(1)(B) functions to assure
that they are not disciplined for anything we believe is im­
permissible because we think that cuts into the privilege that
Congress left, which was to fi te or otherwise discipline
supervise::-members for activities other than 8(b)(1)(B)
functions, and that is why we believe that both the so-called
carryover theory and the deprivation theory are unsound.

The

Board has a direct method of protecting supervisor-members who
«re disciplined for performing 8(b)(1)(B) activities, and that

is to make it an. unifair labor practice to so discipline them,

Supposing that a supervisor simply goes

across the picket line,- the union disciplines him? does ha

doing contract adjustment or grievance work?
MR. GOLD:

I think that th© union would have to have

a basis for believing that he was doing work other than griev­
ance adjustment, but 1 think that under the normal rule that
the party in possession of the fs.ets ought to have) the burden
of going forward.

I would think that there ought to be some

burden on him to show that he didn't do anything other than
handle grievances and bargain.

QUESTION*

So the union can impose a flat rule of

discipline for crossing a picket line and he has got to at
least come up with something c:: the Board has to before they
can show an unfair labor, practice?
MR. GOLD:

That would seesa to me to be the most

logical harden of proof.

In other words, in a situation —

back and forth, if th® supervisor came up to the picket line
and said y. am crossing solely to do bargaining unit or
grievance handling, the union might be — it might be fair to
say that the union has to -show something that he didn't keep

55
his word or be in the soup.

On the other hand, if he just

goes in and comes up against a background where he has never
done solely the handling of grievances and says good-by,
fellows, 1 am going through this line, then it would seem to
me proper for the union to discipline him for doing it and
for hiit. to have to show in a defense that he restricted his
work to grievance handling and bargaining.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORTON J. COME, ESQ.,, ON BEHALF
OF PETITIONER, NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD -REBUTTAL
MR. COMEi

First of all, with respect to Florida

Power, at pages 30 and 31 of the transcript of the oral argu­
ment, this question was put to union counsels

Suppose in an

employee strike you had a group of rank and file employees who
crossed the picket line and than the supervisor crossed the
picket line to supervise them, would you feel that this made

56
this a different case?
case.

Answer, it is a completely different

On what basis do you draw that distinction?

Answer,

because whan a supervisor is in fact directing the work force,
doing what he normally does, he is performing at the very
least a supervisory duty as that is defined in section 2(11)„
QUESTION;

Who was answering?

MR» COME;

Mr. Cohen, the counsel for the union.

Well, we have said that agencies may be

penalized in the weight that wye give their interpretation for
taking ar. inconsistent position.

MR. COME s

Well ~

QUSSTIQNs

Particularly when his answer is inconsis­

tent with the position here, and that was a different case from
the facts, of Florida Power & Light.
MR. COME;

I am not intending to get away from it or

any collateral estopple, I just wanted to make it perfectly
clear that insofar as the decision in Florida Fewer was con­
cerned , the Court did not have before it the question —
QUESTION;

The facte of this case.

MR. COME;

— the facts of this case, and indeed it

was specifically left out of the case on the submission.

Okay.

I think in terms of the policy that want behind
Florida Power, it also n-ade a big difference that only rank
and file work was involved because to deprive the union of the

57
right to discipline people for performing that truly cut at
the heart of the union's strike weapon- and in view of
Insurance Agents and Curtis and section 13 , this Court has
made it clear that absent clear indication from Congress that
it intends to so limit, it is not going to do that.
1 think that when you get to the performance of
supervisory work, as you had here, the balance is a different
one,

and X think that there is that policy difference.
But getting to the last argument that my brother

made, that the burden is on the supervisor or the Board to
show that the supervisor was not in fact performing grievance
adjustment or collective bargaining work is not only an unreal
situation, but it is not required by the statute, because the
statute

proscribes restraining

and coercing the employer

in

the selection of his representative for grievance adjustment
and collective bargaining.
We submit that, when the' employer selects a supervisor
with those

powers

and directs him to come to work in a

situation where there is a potential for exercising those
powers, it is as much an interference with the employer selec­
tion if you deprive him of the representative's authority,
whether he in fact is called upon on a particular day to
adjust grievances or not, becuase in the real world there is
no way of knowing exactly when a grievance is going to arise
or a collective bargaining situation is going to arise.

And

58
certainly a supervisor does not cease to become any less the
management9s selected rspresentative for that purpose due to
the for fixities at a particular hour and on a particular day hc>
didn't have a grievance to adjust.
QUESTION:

And during that whole time he could be

d ox ng struck wor k ?
ME. COME:

But the fact is that he was not doing

struck work in this case,: there is no indication, no evidence
whatsoever.

As a matter of fact —

QUESTION:

Well, I didn’t understand that you were

limiting yourself to this case, in that broad statement you
made of th© right of a employer.

Are you talking about this

employer?
MR, CO IE:

Well, I am talking about this employer

and other employers similarly situated.
QUESTION:

Well, could this employer require them to

do struck work
or not?
1
MR. COMEs

If he required them to do struck work,

then you get into a situation as to whether the struck work
that was being required was minimal or substantial under the
Board's rule::;.

If it was no more than he would normally do

absent a strike — in some of these situations, you have
supervisors that do a minimal amount of rank and file work as
well as their supervisory duties — if it is no more than
that, under the Board's view, it would have the same result

59
as you had here.

If they were asking him to do more than they

would normally do but for the strike, then you would have a
Florida Power situation.

I think this ease is an easy case

because there was no history of the supervisors doing any
bargaining unit struck work, and there was no requirement that
they perform any.

As a matter of fact, the employers made it

perfectly clear that they would not require them to do any
writing that was covered by the bargaining agreement.

They

were only required to perform their normal functions as
producers, directors, and story editors.
QUESTIONs

Any (A) to (H) work?

MR, COMEs

It included some (A) to (H) work, but the

finding of the Administrative haw Judge,

which was affirmed

by the Board, is that (A) to (ri) work was not bargaining
agreement work? it was not struck work.

Whatever you may call

it, it was not struck bargaining agreement work.
QUESTION:

Mr. Come,

do you think the grievance

is the performance of the supervisory duties day to day, which
*\
means that the supervisor is representing the employer in' the
administration of the contract?

I moan, wholly aside from

whether at any phase of the grievance procedure he is the
employer53 representative.
MR. COME:

I think that that argument has validity.

I don.*t think we need to go that far' in this case, because
under the findings of tbs- Administrative Law Judge and the

60

Board, it was perfectly clear that each one of these hyphenates
had grievance adjustment functions and they were exercised
during the strike because this is not a situation where the
strike shut down the plant»

scripts» but they were proceeding to direct and photograph

MR, COMEz

I think it does, your Honor.

distinguishes it from Florida Power, because in Florida Power
you at least found a submission.
