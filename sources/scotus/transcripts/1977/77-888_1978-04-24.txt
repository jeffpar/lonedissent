MR., CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No- 77-888, Vitek against Miller.
Mr. Karamerlehr, I think you can proceed when you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELVIN KENT KAMMERLOKR
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. KAMMERLOKR:

Thank you, your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:

As the

Court knows, this case involves the broad question of the
transfer of a penal complex: inmate to a mental hospital, a
State mental hospital.

More narrowly encompassed probably

within that question is the constitutionality of a Nebraska
statute which providas generally that upon a finding by a
physican or psychologist appointed by the Director of
Corrections that an .inmate has a mental defect or suffers from
a mental defect and it is also the opinion of this physician
or psychologist that he canno c be properly treated in the
penal institution which ha is in, the Director may transfer him
to & State mental hospital.
It also provides, and I think one of the things
the lower court overlooked, was that the transfer is for
examination, study, and treatment and that the State mental
hospital has the duty to send the inmate back when treatment is
no longer necessary.

4
QUESTION;

May he ba detained .In the mental hospital

ment <
MR. KAMf4i5RLOHR:

two psychiatrists find that ha should ba retainad, then they
must file and see that he gets the same mental health commit­
ment that persons on the outside receive.
QUESTION:

Civil commitment„

MR. KAMMERLOHR:

Civil commitment, yes, your Honor,

the same one.
QUESTION:

I suppose you can transfer a prisoner

and keep him in the mental facility during his term, during
his prison term, for reasons and under circumstances that you
couldn't get him committed after his prison term is over.
MR. KAMMERLOHR;
QUESTION:

No?

No, your Honor.
You mean if you couldn't commit a
r

person out on the street, you couldn't transfer one of these
prisoner's to the mental facility?
MR. KAMMERLOHR:

I sea what you mean.

I thought

you meant after the term had expired, your Honor.
QUESTION:

No.

During the prison term you can

transfer him to the mental facility for reasons that would
never justify putting him there after his term is over.

5
MR. KAMMERLOHR:

Possibly.

It’s strictly,

according to the statute, on the opinion of the physician, or
the psychologist.
QUESTION:

Putting it the same way, if he is in

prison, you may transfer him for reasons which perhaps if he
never had gone to prison, you could not initially commit him,

QUESTION:

Is that right?

MR. KAMMERLOHR:

Yes, your Honor.

?or examination, study, and

On the other hand, the receivers at fcho State

mental hospital must then *— and they are bound by statute
to transfer him back if he should not have treatment.
QUESTION:
treatment, isn't it?

Yes, but that's just a question of
But he can't go back if he wants to.

He can be detained there against his will if -they think he
needs treatment.
MR. KAMMERLOHR:
QUESTION:

That’s correct, your Honor.

But he is going to be detained somewhere

against, his will.
MR. KAKHERLOHRs

He is going to be detained some­

where .
QUESTION r.

Suppose he developed symptoms of acute

appendicitis, what do they do with him?
MR. KAMMERLOHRs
they do the same thing.

Any hind of physical, your Honor,

They either fcr..

For any illness, they transfer him to

MR. KAMMERLOHRs
penal institution.

They treat him if they can at the

If they cannot, they take him into the

city of Lincoln to a private hospital visually.
In this particular case, for example, the appellee
Jones burned himself, lit a mattress while he was k solitary
confinement, burned himself very badly, and was taken in
emergency to a private hospital, St. Elisabeth's Hospital in
Lincoln, and remained in their burn unit -- they have

special

burn unit — for five months with .this condition, vary bad
burns.
QUESTIOK:

Suppose a prisoner says, ”1 am now in

this mental facility and you propose to give me some shock
treatments," or something like that, "Well, 1 don't want those
treatments.

I want to go back.

I know you have got to keep

me somewhere, but I don't want to be over here and submit to
the treatments.’'
Now, I take it you would say that although if he
weren't in prison the State couldn't keep him, you think you
are entitled to keep him because ha has been, sentenced to a
prison term.
MR. KftMMERLOHR:

Well, my argument runs this way,

your Honor, that those things should be properly attacked on

a question cf the conditions of confinement, -the constitutions

7
of the conditions and -that

having a commitment procedure

such as the lower court tried to dasigr here is not even
going to cone close to reaching the problem, because of the
variety find availability and quality of the facilities, all
over the United States.

And to try to make one blanket rule

of commitment doesn't reach the problem, that those things
ought to be looked into, which they are all the time in
42 U.S.C. 1983 cases, civil rights cases, as to the —

Suppose he brought habeas and the court

Could he

do that under your State procedure?
;V;1

MR. KhMMEELGdR2
QUESTION?

2 don't believe sc, your Honor.

How about Federal habeas?

MR. KhMMLRuGHR;

I think

£a a Federal habeas or

Federal civil rights action that anything could fes done.
As this Court wall knows, we have been involved in
civil rights actions on the constitutionality of the care and
treatment in mental health facilities, in mentally retarded
i.

facilities, in prisons.

' • .•’!

Unfortunately, none of those cases

have reached this Court yet.

But the Federal district courts

are setting up all kinds of guidelines and rules that these
facilities must follow.,

And it seems to me that if the

court said that you ear or you may or may not give him a shock
treatment unless you do thus and so, l think that can all foe

9

'done under a proper ruling of a. civil rights action.
Maybe it would help if I backed up to the posture
.of this case.

I filed a motion for summary judgment.

This

action was brought that the Nebraska statute for transfer was
;Uv

•

Unconstitutional on its face,, and I filed a motion for summary
r.

./•’judgment, which was overruled.

There was no allegation that

the State had not followed that statute.

And it seems to me

under Meachum v. Fano and Montanye v. Haynes that the question is
dees transfer to a mental hospital come within those two esses?
Does he have some right, some liberty interest, which had not
been extinguished at the trial?
The lower court didn't directly face that issue.
The lower court said that the Nebraska statuto gave him an
expectation within the exception to Meachum and Montanye , but
they didn’t then refer to tha method of tha transfer.

They

merely said, «This in an exception to Montanye and Meaohnia
and therefore he is entitled to due process hearing.”
The Stato statute is what was conferred.

If you

c,.

rely on State lax*, what was conferred was that he may be
transferred,or may not if you want to taka the negative,
unless a physician finds that he should be.

And this all

. V.-.U

happened.

There is no allegation that this did not happen.

Therefor©;, it’s no longer an exception to Meachum, and we have
to go back to Meachum and do ws want to extend Meachum that.
if

far then

10
QUESTIONS

Bo you ■ think the State law means that

his transfer is conditional cr the fact of a finding by a
doctor rather than on the truth of the fact?
MR. K/U'iMEfeXOHRs
QUESTION?

Yes, your Honor.

And that finding is not after an

adversary proceeding of any kind.
MR. KAMMSRLOHK.s
QUESTIONS

Xt*s not what, sir?

That doesn’t follow an adversary proceed­

ing of any kind, it's just a doctor ©«amines him and concludes,
MR, KAMMEKLOHR:

That8a correct.

And X chink that

everthing that was conferred by statute has been followed.
So then the next question is should Meaohura include transfer
to a mental hospital the same as it includes transfer to other
types of penal facili ties when this is within the contemplation
of: the sentence?

It was certainly within the contemplation

of the sentence that a person may go to some kind of a
hospital.

All of our statutes include this, and they are very

bix>«d to the Director of Corrections what he may do with
various prison inmates.

the incorrigible ones do, do they administer tranquilizers

What do you do with the last sentence: of

the statute, on appendix page 5 of your jurisdictional statute,
that says, "A person who is so transferred shall remain
subject to 'the jurisdiction and custody of the Department of
Correctional Services and shall bo returned to the Department
when, prior to the expiration of his sentence, treatment, in
such facility is no longer necessary.”
You say that the treatment-is-no-longer-necessary
decision ie one that is made by the people in the transferee
facility,and the warden in ths transferring facility must
respect it?
MR. KAMMSBLGBRi
QUESTION;

Yes, your Honor.

Isn't the purpose so that the mental

institution can't turn him loose on the public?

Isn't that

it?
MR. KAMMERLOHRs
QUESTIONS

That's right, your Honor.

And if they are going to turn him loose,

• they turn him back to the prison.
MR. KAK&EKLOHR:

That's right, your Honor.,

That's

the way I understand it.
And also we have another statute, Section 83-100

MR. HURTSs
please the Courts

Mra Chief Justice, your Honors, may it

X will address icy argument first of all to

the issue of mootness.
I last spoke with Larry Jones approximately three.

mid a half to four weeks ago-

He indicated to me at that time

that h© was still incarcerated in the Danville, Illinois,
veterans’ hospital.

He was on a locked security ward,

X posed

to him the question as to whether or not. h© is receiving
medication, whether or not this is voluntary or involuntary.
He indicated that he was taking the medication that was
prescribed for him voluntarily.
QUESTION}

Do you suggest that the State of Nebraska

has any responsibility for either his custody or his treatment
at the present time?
MR. WURTZ:

Yes, your Honor.

I think because of the

very limited nature of the parole that was given to Mr. Jones -•
he wasn’t given a parol© on which he could go out and. live in
society.

He couldn’t seek a job.

He was told to go strictly

to the mental hospital and to abide by that.

Of course, ha was transferred there

QUESTION:

You suggested a moment ago that if he

didn’t take his medication, he would soon be back in Nebraska.

£$ that on the thought that the veterans5 hospital would refuse
to have anything more to do with him?
MR. WURT2s

Somewhat, your Honor.

£ think inherent

In being treated by a psychiatrist, the psychiatrist would fool
that you have to agree with thair diagnosis and gs along with
their proscriptior, or they can't do anything with you.

I think

if foie would not want fco take his medication, the payehiafrist
there cn that wing of the vet-arans

hospital would probably

21

send him back,
QUESTION 3

But that is true of lots of other

complaints besides psychiatric ones,

As I understand it* if

you have a back problem, a liver problem, any number of things
that happen to people twice your age, yon can find out, that
the doctor says, "Either do this, follow my advice, have an
operation, don't have an operation, or X just can't go on
treating yon,”

It's not limited to psychiatric car©,

ME, WURT2%

I would suggest, your Honor, that one

has an inherent right to refuse medical treatment whether he
be a civilian walking around on the street or whether he be
in prison.

It’s different when you are talking about refusing

medication, though, because once you give the Stato the power
to transfer someone from a psnal complex to a mental institu­
tion, as we see in the record hero, you-give the psychiatrist
ths power to place that person on medication, which they cannot
t

refusa to take.

State of Nebraska that he did not feel that he was in med of
psychiatric care and there was a hearing and ha could
present evidence as to that# he could have an attorney,
and if there was a finding by an independent decision-maker
that he was mentally ill, I think than th© State should b® able
to transfer him to 'die Lincoln Regional Center for th©

QUJ3STX0K:

Your case really depends on our assumption

that exactly tha same treatment could have been given to him
in the facility where he was as would be given to him in the
facility to which he was transferred, doesn't it?
MIU HOOTS s

Mo, it*s act based on that assumption»

2 think tha court below took note of that.

1 think the statute,

83-180, states that we really won't transfer someone to the
Lincoln Regional Center unless conditioned upon a finding that
we can't treat them here at the penal complex.
QUESTIONt

to you think that statute is —• wall,

go ahead.
S6E» WURTS5*

&nd one of the Mg differences, 1 think,

between the penal complex hospital itself and the Lincoln
Regional Canter, the state mental hospital, is that in the
penal complex hospital itself, a prisoner can walk down there
voluntarily, but he doesn’t have to take felne medication»
doctor can prescribe it, but ho am refuse to take it.

-she
So

when they have serious cases like, for example, Mr, Justice
Marshall mentioned a man that is banging on everyone, a person
like that, h-a would have to he transferred to the regional
center, because they wouldn’t forcibly give him medication in
■she penal complex.
QUESTION?

Do you think the statute was intended to

27
confer a right on th© prisoner that certain findings be made
or that certain fact aituatiens exist before he was transferred?

QUESTION 8

General Ktonmarlohr, could 1 ask you a

question on that?
MR. KAMMSRLQHRs
QUSSTIOH:

Of course, your Honor.

Supposing during a criminal trial the

teiai judge had s law clerk who knew quite a bit about
psychiatry arid maybe his is even a medical psychiatrist, and at
•*h&"and of the trial the trial judge said, *Vfell, I have heard

45
ail the evidence and instead of sentencing yon to the prison,
I have talked to. ray law clerk and we decided it would bo
better for you to go to a mental hospital."
MR* KAKMEHLOBR;
QUESTIONi

Could ho do that?

Ho, your Honor*

Why not?

Constitutionally could ha do

it assuming the statutes authorized that the

trial judge cm

have discretion without any hearing on mental competence to
send either to prison or to a mental hospital*

Would the

Constitution tolerate that?
MR* KM@SBRI.OHRs
QUESTIONS

Yes, your Honor.

They might want more than the law clerk’s

opinion, however, might they not, Mr. Kararaarlohr?
MR. KAKMBRLOHRt

They might.

But assuming -« 1

know what Mr* Justice Stevens is getting at is hie dissent
as to whether or not there is a residual, after the conviction,
any residual right such as right to religions study and right
to reasonable medical treatment, and those things.
As to that, your Honor, l tm saying even if there
is a residual, that the method in 'this statute satisfies

the

hearing that the lower court tried to outline.
QUESTION;

Wo don’t have to be concerned about the

mthod in this statuta unless we first decide whether the
convicted person has any protected constitutional interest in
not being sent to a mental institution.
MR. SfeMMHBLOHSe

That’s right.

that just a matter of grace given by the State?

MR» KhSoMKRTiOHRs

The Constitution -- the only thing

that we have gotten so far as far as this Court is concerned
that X can recall is reasonable medical treatment»

That's net: my positionP your Honor#

I am saying if this Court, finds there is a

residual# that the Efcabraska method of doing it is
constitutional and that the Court should not have looked into
whether any process was due in the first place, but if they
did, that 'they should hm& found that our method was a more
reasonable method than having this hearing.

Yes, your Honor.

That's your second argument.

a strong ct\cm Moachiaa v. Pano and Montanve, but I do believe

oases.
