MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

next in 7 6-1706 , Department of Revenue of the State of
Washington v. Association of Washington Stevedoring Companies ,
Et Al.
Mr. Attorney General, I think you can reasonably
begin.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SLADE GORTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GORTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The State of Washington imposes a general gross
receipts tax on practically all services performed within the
state, together with a similar tax on other business activities.
It is the principal form of taxation on business imposed for
the support of state institutions and services.
The source of any goods upon which taxable services
are performed is irrelevantr there is therefore no discrimin­
ation against goods originating at or destined to points out­
side of the state.
In Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. Tax Commission, in
1937, this Court found that tax to be invalid insofar as it
was imposed upon a stevedore's bueinss of loading and unload­
ing ships in interstate and foreign commerce.

The basis of

that decision was that stevedoring "is interstate or foreign

4

commerce?"

the privilege of engaging in which was not sub­

ject to what you then characterised as a direct tax by the
state.
Ten years later', in Carter £ Weekes, you adhered
to that decision.

The Court held that the tax. was not

properly apportioned and that the! risk of multiple taxation
was present because both the state of the loading and that of
the unloading might tax the stevedoring activities in their
respective jurisdictions.
Stevedoring was; not considered to be distinct
enough from the transit by ship to be taxable.

At that time,

of course, to characterise the tax as being directly on
interstate commerce was sufficient to invalidate it.

Four

Justices dissented.
You have agreed to review the soundness of Carter
S Weekes and Puget Sound Stevedoring, perhaps in the light of
your recent decisions in Michelin Tire and Complete Auto
Transit.
We submit, however, that the vitality of those two
stevedoring precedents erded as long ago as 1951 when you

)
decided Canton Railroad v. Rogan and Western Maryland Railway
v. Rogan.
Roughly half of the Canton Railroad’s receipts were
for wharfage services»- the privilege of using Canton’s piers
for the transfer of cargo to lighters and to trucks, and for

5

switching freight cars loaded with imports and exports be­
tween the piers and the trunkline railroads.

Maryland

nevertheless imposed a gross receipts tax on all of
Canton's income, including that from these services for
imports and exports.

Yon found that tax not to violate

Article I *. section 10, as it was not levied against the
articles of import and export because "the tax is not on the
goods but on the handling of them, at the port; an article
may be an export and immune from a tax long before or long
after it reaches the port, but when the tax is on activities
connected with the export or import, the range of immunity
cannot be so wide."
It is true that the Court expressly reserved the
question of whether stevedoring fell within its holding.
Stevedoring, of course, was not before you.

But a tax on

stevedoring is as clearly one on the handling of goods at
•die port and not on the goods themselves as was the tax in
Canton.
Just two years ago, in Michelin Tire, you took the
opportunity even more carefully to examine the import-export
clause.

You decided there that a nond is criminatory property

tax on imported tires in storage was not an impost
prohibited by Article I, section 10.

01*

a duty

I note, however, that

unlike the activities here and in Canton, the tax in Michelin
Tire was? levied directly on the goods and not merely on the

6
activity of handling them.
In Michelin Tire, you examined the concerns of the
framers of the Constitution in drafting the import-export
clause.

You found three such concerns.

First, the necessity

that the United States speak with one voice in regulating of
foreign relations and international trade;

second, import

duties were to be the major source of the federal govern­
ment’s revenues and should not be diverted to the states;
and, third, harmony among the states was to be preserved by
preventing seaboard states from taxing goods merely passing
through on their way to interior states.
The respondents here do not suggest that Washington’s
tax has any impact on the first two concerns.

They do, how­

ever,- accuse us of a tailgate mentality, of trying to get
something for nothing from the citizens of other states whose
goods use our ports.

They are in error.

First, it is somewhat odd that respondent’s should
so castigate tolls.

Perhaps they hope that the Court would

prohibit the State of Maryland from charging a truck a toll
for crossing the Chesapeake Bay Bridge simply because the
truck was carrying exports bound for a ship at the dock in
Baltimore.

But a nond i sc r imin at or y toll in return for a

service provided is clearly constitutional.
The validity of a tax or toll or levy

is not de­

termined by the label which those who pay it attach to it.

7
The characterisations or assertions upon which respondents’
argument rests are found on pages 21 and 22 of its brief.
First, respondents claim that by their nature imports and
exports passing through seaports involve stevedores.

Next,

they assert that all must, admit that a tax on the mover of
imports is a tax on the goods themselves.
both counts.

They are wrong on

Our tax --

QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, it is not your

submission, is it, that this tax is the equivalent of a toll
collectad by a state for a specific service rendered such as
the use of a state road, are you?
MR. GORTON:

It. is not.

I am simply stating that

to characterize it as a toll on the part s>f the respondents
doesn’t answer any of the; questions which are before you.

It

is up to you to determine what it actually is.
QUESTION:

But you don’t say that it is a toll?

MR. GORTON;
of the toll, either.

I don’t claim that it is an equivalent
I just say the tailgate argument is

irrelevant.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gorton, now- that you are interrupted,

am I correct that your tax does not apply to farming or to
insurance?
MR. GORTON:

This specific tax does not apply to

the occupation of farming or to insurance.
covered by another tax.

Insurance is

There is an insurance premium tax

8
in the state and, of course, farmers pay a disproportionate
real property tax because of their holdings.
QUESTION;
MR. GORTON:

At least they will say they do?
At least they will claim they do,

successfully to the legislature.

Our tax at least in this

case, like the toll on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, is not
levied against imports or exports at all.

For example, it

does not apply to imports; or exports by air or by rail or
even by ship when no in-state stevedoring services are pro­
vided.
The table inserted fit the end of respondents' own
brief is perhaps the most graphic illustration of this point.
Neither Washington's most, important export, aircraft, nor its
most important import, petroleum, requires the use of
stevedoring services at s.ll.
QUESTION:

You told us not too long ago right where

you were that apples was a pretty big one.
MR. GORTON;

They were and they don't use steve­

dores,, except on the rare occasion when they are being
shipped overseas rather than tc North Carolina, as in that
case.

Thus neither of these major exports and imports is

subject to the tax.
On the other hand, our tax is applied to the
analogous

intrastate services of freight handlers, for ex­

ample, whether the destination of the freight they handle is

9

inside the state,, in another state, or in a foreign country.
We, like Maryland in Canton Railroad, are not taxing goods at
all but merely the handling of those goods at the port.
The respondents:' bald decision that the* two are
identical is not only conceptually in error but repudiates
directly your holding in Canton Railroad, which brings us to
the analogous limitations of the commerce clause.
Last year, in Complete Auto Transit, you resolved
that the test of the validity of a tax affecting commerce is
"not the formal language of the tax statute but, rather, its
practical effect."

And that a tax is to be sustained when

it "is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with
the taxing stateris fairly apportioned, does not discriminate
against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to the

services provided

by the state."

The respondents here don't deny the substantial
nexus, nor can they claim that the tax is other than precisely
apportioned because all of their business is done wholly
within the State of Washington.
against interstate commarce.

The tax does not discriminate

It applies equally to stevedor­

ing services and to all other services with respect to goods,
to handling goods, whether the goods come from or are bound
to other points in the State of Washington, Alaska, or Japan.
Finally, the tax is reasonably related to services
provided by the state.

For forty years, respondents have

10
avoided the principal business tax applied to other busi­
nesses in the state for the support of both state and local
services»

It is time to end their free ride»
The respondents claim that, even though the tax may

not be discriminatory now, it might become so in the future.
In both Complete Auto Transit and Michelin Tire, you found
that assertion to be insufficient to invalidate a tax»

The

rationale for such a decision here is even stronger.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will resume at that

point at 10; 00 o'clock tcuiorrow morning, Mr. Attorney
General.
\

MR. GORTON;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

above-entitled matter was recessed,

to resume on Tuesday,

January 17, 1978, at 10:00 o'clock a.rn„]
