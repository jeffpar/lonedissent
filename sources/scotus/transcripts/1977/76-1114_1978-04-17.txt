El Paso Natural Gas Company and Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission against Southland Royalty Company et al.
Mr. Barnett.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R, BARNETT, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION
MR,. BARNETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
As the Court will recall, we are dealing here with an
oil and gas lease ~~ actually, ti^o of them, but I think they
can be reduced to one for purposes of the argument -- running
for a term of fifty years to the mineral estate underlying the
Waddell Ranch in West Texas, where the lessee, Gulf, was selling
the gas from the reserves under the Waddell Ranch in Interstate commerce pursuant to certificates of public convenience
and necessity granted by the Commission.
The Question presented is whether, when the 50-year
lease expires, Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act requires
the lessors. Southland Royalty and others, that is the holders
of the reversionary interest in the mineral estate, to obtain
abandonment authority from the Commission before they may stop
the

service oi supplying gas to interstate commerce and divert

4
that flow of gas Instead to the intrastate market,
Now., first* I would like to explain why we take the
position that what is dedicated to interstate commerce here and
hence cannot be abandoned without the Commission1® approval
under Section 7(b)* is the service of supplying gas to the inter­
state market from these reserves underlying the Waddell Ranch*
the reserves from which the gas was continuing to flow to the
interstate market at the moment that the lease expired.
Now* Respondents speak throughout their brief and
my colleague* Mr. Atwell* spoke throughout his argument last
time as though what was involved here was two distinct bodies
of gas* two physically distinct bodies of gas* Gulf’s gas and
Southland's gas* as they put It,

Thus* in Respondent’s brief

at page 18 it stated* "The Commission held that Southland
Royalty's gas -was dedicated to interstate service because Gulf
had made an interstate sale of Gulf's leasehold gas.

Whether

Gulf thus dedicated Southland Royalty’s gas is the issue before
this Court."

That's Respondent's view of it.

In pursuit of this theory* Respondents analogize the
case to the situation of vertical or horizontal limitations on
interstate sales.

The case where a producer limits vertically

to a certain distance below the ground the gas that Is being
sold Interstate* or where a producer limited horizontally* say.
to 500 acres of a l*000~acre tract.

Or Respondents analogize

the case to that of a split stream*, where certain producers
/•r

*'

\

\

5
owning shares in a producing property make interstate sales of
their gas while other producers make intrastate sales of their
shares.

And Respondents say that this ease is, in their terms,

simply a case of a severance in time, rather than a» severance
in space*

Quote from their brief at page 12, "The severance

between a fixed-term leasehold interest and a mineral fee inter­
est is a severance in time, rather than a horizontal or vertical
severance in space," To Respondents, they are both the same,
and this case should be analogized to the others.

As Mr, Atwell

said last time, li's just as if Gulf owned Black Acre and Southland owned White Acre,

The parcels are that separate.

And so

the Court of Appeals held here, applying Texas law.
Well, there are several reasons why we think this
analogy is no good, why we think a severance in time, that is
the severance created here between the leasehold and the re­
versionary estate? is ..quite different for purposes of the Natural
Gas Act from the spatial severances to which Respondents would
analogize it.
First of all, the argument Ignores the certificates
that were granted to Gulf here.

The certificates granted to

Gulf here were not limited in time*

Now, in this case, we know
t

that as clearly as we ever could because the very certificates

!

that were granted to Gulf for this particular — for the re­
serves under the Waddell Ranch were before this Court in the
Sun Oil case and were expressly held there not to be limited in

6
time.

That is the first thing that we find wrong with the

argument.
But more Important, the attempt to analogiae the
so-called severance in time here with these limitations of
space is quite inconsistent with the language and purposes of
the Natural Gas Act.
ence.

There is* first of all* a physical differ'

In the case of the vertical or horizontal limitation on

the interstate sale* the stream never flows in interstate com­
merce* in the first place.

There is simply a limitation on the

amount of gas that flows in interstate commerce,in the first
place.

There is no stream flowing in interstate commerce that

would be shut off and diverted to intrastate commerce* as would
happen here, if Respondents prevail.
That is the heart of this case.

Respondents here

claim that by virtue of their status as a certain kind of
property owner, under Texas law, they may cut off a stream of
gas from given reserves that is flowing to interstate commerce
at the end of this lease and divert it physically to the intra­
state market instead, without having to get the Commission's
abandonment authority under Section 7(b),
Now* the distinction here is crucial with respect to
the purpose of Section (b) and, indeed, of the entire Act.
That purpose* as this Court emphasized in Sunray, among other
cases, is to protect the continuity of service to the inter­
state market* the stability of natural gas prices and supply,

7
Well* In the case of the vertical or horizontal
limitation on the sale* the interstate market never comes to
rely on that sale because the gas is never flowing to the inter­
state market in the first place.

The interstate consumers can­

not become dependent on the part of the gas that would now be
reserved for intrastate use because that part never entered
interstate commerce in the first place.
Here* in contrast* the stream of gas from the reserves
underlying the Waddell Ranch has supplied El Paso's interstate
customers since 1951.

El Paso and its customers have come to

rely on that supply.

And* indeed* the amount of gas involved

in this case represents more than 1$ of El Paso's total annual
firm supply of gas.

That's in the record at Appendix* page 375

Further* if El Paso loses this case and if the Gemmis si on loses
this case* the amount of gas that El Paso would now have to re­
turn to Southland and the other reversionary owners* under the
protective agreement* now amounts to $37 million MCF.

QUESTION:
>

That is

Is that in the record?

MR. BARNETT:

No* that's not in the record.

That's

a figure as of March 1* 1978. supplied by the Commission.
QUESTION:

What difference would it make if it were

ten times that much* to the legal issues involved in this case?
MR... BARNETT:

Well* the point is that that gas would

have to come out of the Interstate market.

It would have to

*

8
crane out of supplies that El Paso would otherwise be able to
provide to the interstate market.

And that illustrates the

purpose of the Natural Gas Act which is involved in this case
which is to assure supply to the interstate market.
So* as I was saying., the basic purpose of the Act, it
seems to uss distinguishes sharply between the flow that has
begun and would now be cut off by what Respondents call a
severance in time and a horizontal or a vertical limitation or
a split stream limitation, where the gas never flows to the inter­
state market in the first place and thus there is no reliance on
it and no continuity to protect.
Further, we submit that the very language of Section
7(b)s the very word "abandonment*" distinguishes between a
severance in time and a spatial severance,

A statutory require­

ment that a service may not be abandoned is precisely a command
that a severance in time is not permitted.

That's what abandon­

ment means,
Now* if the statute also had a provision that pro­
hibited any spatial segmentation,, that prohibited any percentage
segmentation of a gas reserve* then it might be appropriate to
argue that severances in space can be analogized to severances
in time,

But there is no such provision.

The very purpose

and meaning of abandonment is that you cannot stop something
that has been started, that a severance in time must be dis­
tinguished from a severance In space.

9
This is supported also by this Court's decisions*
For example* California v* ho-Vaca Gathering. 379* U.S. 366*
cited in El Paso's brief* holds* we submit* that once gas flows
in interstate commerce* it is subject to the Commission's juris­
diction* that even with a sale for resale in interstate commerce
Federal jurisdiction follows the flow* as the Court there said.
That* too* distinguishes the spatial severance which would cufc
off a flow that has begun from the

I am sorry* the so-called

temporal severance that would cut off a flow that has begun
from the spatial cases where the flow never starts in the first
place,,
Now, we submit here that what has been dedicated on
the facts of this case by Gulf sale in interstate commerce is
a service in interstate commerce and service is a key concept
under Section 7* as this Court held in Sun ray,. Of course* a
service of supplying gas from the particular reserves under­
lying the Waddell Ranch* and that that service,that stream of
gas running from these particular reserves has been dedicated
by Gulf Oil and may not be abandoned without the Commission's
approval,
Southland has* in fact* taken a rather similar
position with which we agree,

In Southland's brief before the

Commission which appears in the record at page A-476* Southland
said this* and I am reading from A«476:

"Preliminarily*

Mineral Interest Owners" — that's Southland and the other

10

reversioners — "agree with El Paso's statement that* once
dedicated to interstate commerce, gas reserves may not be re­
moved from interstate commerce without abandonment authoriza­
tion»"

Gas reserves may not be removed from interstate com­

merce without abandonment authorization»
That, of course, is what would happen here.

This

gas, at the termination of the lease, is flowing from the
particular reserves under the Waddell Ranch.
Our position is that that flow may not be terminated
until the reserves are exhausted without the Commission's ap­
proval.

Southland appeared there to have taken the same

position.
We would cite other support for this notion that
Section 7 applies to the flow until the reserves are exhausted.
In the I-iunt case in the Fifth Circuit, 306 F2d 334-* which the
Commission relied on and which we quoted in our brief, the
Court said that the obligation to continue serving is like the
ancient covenant running with the land — I am sorry — like
the ancient covenant running with the land' The duty to con­
tinue to deliver and sell flows with the gas from the moment
of the first delivery down to the exhaustion of the reserve,
or until the Commission, on appropriate terns, permits cessation
of service under Section 7(b).
1 might here, since this case talks about a covenant

running with the land, say a word in response to the argument

11

that our colleagues from Texas have made.

They argue that this

notion of a covenant running with the land would create all
sorts of problems of clouds on title in Texas because one would
never know whether some previous lessee of particular acreage
had made an Interstate sale and then ceased it.

And* thus* if

one discovers a completely new reserve on that land* one might
subsequently find that gas in that reserve had been dedicated.
As we pointed out In our reply brief* which apparently
our colleague from Texas did not refer to last time* that is
not an accurate representation of the position the Commission
has taken here.

The Commission’s position here is that this

gas is dedicated until the reserve is exhausted* that in the
words of the Hunt case the duty to continue to deliver and sell
flows with the gas from the moment of the first delivery down
to the exhaustion of the reserve.

That is the covenant the

Court was talking about in the Hunt case and that is the coven­
ant we are talking about here.
As further support for this notion of dedication of
a particular reserve or a particular field* I would call the
Court’s attention to the United Gas Pipe. Line case* 385* U.S.

83.
QUESTION:

What do you suggest?

Do you suggest that

this is a matter of law* federal law* that says to a lessee that
— and to his lessor that if you are going to get in the inter­
state market you are in until we let you out?

12

MR. BARNETT:

Once the lessee has made sales In Inter­

state commerce pursuant to a Commission certificate which has
no limit on time, that service is dedicated until the reserves
run out.
QUESTION:

So when the lease expires -- you don't

dispute the fact that the lease expires?
MR. BARNETT: No, no, not at all.
QUESTION:

And when the lease expires, the lessor is

still stuck in the interstate market because that was the rule
of law in the first place, is that it?
MR. BARNETT:

That's right, because the lessee, acting

within the authority granted by the lease? began a service,
instituted a service which the lessee had full authority to do
under the lease, and this service has come under the Commission's
jurisdiction and is dedicated to interstate commerce so long,
at least, until the gas flows from the particular reserves.
As Southland, itself, said before the Commission, "The reserves
have been dedicated."
QUESTION:

That is our position.
If there was a clause in the lease that

says you cannot sell this gas in the interstate market, would
a certificate be issued for the interstate market or not?
MR, BARNETT:

QUESTION:

If the Commission knew about that clause

Well, the leases are filed, aren't they?

MR. BARNETT:

The leases., in fact, as I understand it,

13
are nofc filed, are note brought to the attention —
QUESTION:

I know, but when they apply for the cer­

tificate they must make soma representation about *•MR» BARNETT:

It is my understanding that the leases,

as a matter of course, are not brought to the attention of the
Commission, but let's assume that they are.

I assume if-the

Commission knows that the lessee has no authority under the
lease to make an interstate sale.

The Commission would nofc

grant the certificate,
QUESTION:

So, you are saying, legally, it is as

though it was a joint application for certificate from the
lessor and the lessee.
MBs BARNETT:

That is the legal conclusion, but it

is not based on any agency that the lessee has from the lessor;
it is based on the facts of what the lessee did within the
authority granted by the lease.

The lessee was authorized to

make interstate sales, in fact, may have had a duty to, when
it did sell.

And under the Natural Gas Act, with its purpose

of assuring continuity to the interstate market, that flow,
those sales from those reserves may not be abandoned without
abandoning authorization.

That is our position.

Mr. Justice White, the United Gas Pipe Line case,
which was an opinion written by you, as I recall, where the
Court rejected the notion that the word "service" under Section
7(b) could include only the sale.of natural, gas, not the taking

14

and transportation of gas from any particular field.

Rather,

the Court said# at page 39? "It could not be more clear that
United here abandoned a service# the taking of Johnson Bayou
field gas and its transportation in interstate commerce."

And

we would cite that for the proposition that what is begun is a
service of .supplying gas from a particular field# a particular
reserve# anc3 that is what may not be cut off without the
Commission’s authorization.
Now# Respondents argue that there is something being
done here that is inconsistent with basic principles of property
law# that one cannot encumber a property interest that one does
not own and# hence# that Gulf cannot encumber Southland’s gas#
still pursuing their notion that there are two separate packages
of gas here# rather than a continuing flow from the same reserve.
QUESTION:

Well# there are two separate owners# arenEt

there?
MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

There are two separate owners.

One the general owner and the other a

lessee.
MR. BARNETT:

That is true# Mr. Chief Justice,

We do

not question that.
QUESTION:

Your case turns on the power of the lessee#

through the Act# to commit the owner in perpetuity?
MR. BARNETT:

Until this particular reserve runs out#

in any event# yes# or until the Commission grants abandonment

15
authority, of course.
QUESTION:

Is that duty you speak of to sell in the

interstate market, is that a Texas law proposition?
MR, BARNETT:

Thera is authority in Texas law, the

Cola case, cited in the briefs, for the notion that a lessee
has a duty to sell.

And at the time these sales were made the

interstate market was virtually the only place that this gas
could be sold.

Now, Respondents, in their brief, have argued

that that was not true of Texas as a whole at this time.

We

submit it was true of the Permian Basin where this gas comes
from,
QUESTION:

But, in any event, you do insist that

the lessee had the authority to sell in the interstate market?
MR. BARNETT:

I don't think Respondents even dispute

that, Mr. Justice White.
Well, in response to Respondents 8 argument about how
one cannot supposedly encumber a property interest that one
does not own, we do not see any such radical innovation here.
We point out in our brief the Interstate Commerce Act cases
which support the proposition that once a lessee operates
railroad property there can be no abandonment unless the
Commission grants authority either to the lessee or the lessor.
But, more basically, we would look at the basicpurpose of public utility regulation.

The purpose of public

utility regulation is based on the public interest in the

16
service or the property being regulated.

The purpose is to

regulate for the public benefit a business or a property that
has become effected with the public interest.

And in the

Natural Gas Act* Section 1(a)* Congress expressly finds that
"the business of transporting and selling natural gas for
ultimate distribution to the public is effected with the public
interest."
Now* that is the business that the lessee here has
started under the authority of the lease.

The theory of public

interest regulation has never been based on the notion of
estoppel or consent.

Thus* Respondents here do not complain

and cannot complain about the fact that when they granted their
lease in 1925 they had no way of knowing that the Natural Gas
Act would come along later or that the Phi lips decision would
come along later.

They realized that they are subject

that

the sales Gulf made*at least* were subject to the Commission's
jurisdiction* even though they never consented to that when they
made the sale.
Thus* since the purpose of public utility regulation
is based on the public's interest in what's being regulated
and not on any notion of estoppel or waiver or consent by the
owners* it shouldn't matter that it's the lessor rather than the
lessee who* by virtue of property law* has come with the control
of the property being- regulated,
Let me try a hypothetical case which may illustrate

17
this.

Suppose an owner of a large tract of land leases it for

25 or 50 years to a developer.

This is undeveloped real estate.

The land is leased to a developer and the lessee proceeds to
build residential housing., say, garden apartments* on the land.
Now* at the time of the lease* the land is not zoned at all.
It is undeveloped and unzoned.

But as a result of the lessee's

construction of the residential housing the local government
authority steps in and zones the land residential.

Suppose*

even further* that the lessee appears at the zoning hearing and
supports the residential zoning.

Now* at the expiration of that

lease* 25 or 50 years later* when the lessor comes into the
reversion* if the lessor wants to build a factory on that land
the lessor may find that he cannot do so because the land was
zoned residential* and that zoning has resulted from actions
taken by the lessee under the lease,
QUESTION:

I

Couldn't, he tear the houses down if he
I

wanted to?
MR. BARNETT:

He could tear the houses down if he

wanted to but he would still have to get the zoning changed*
I suppose.
QUESTION:

Why would he have to get the zoning changed

to tear the houses down?
MR. BARNETT:

No* no* he would have to get the zoning

changed to build his factory* I assume -QUESTION;

But at least he has the power to-discontinue

18

the use of the property for the purpose it had been used for
during the lease,, doesn'Jfc he?
MR. BARNETT;

Yes, but assuming what he wants to do

is build a factory on a portion of the property that would not
require tearing the houses down.

In any event, the point is

this property is now zoned residential and he will have to get
that zoning changed somehow.

And that is, in Respondent's terns.»

the Respondent might say the lessee has somehow encumbered the
reversionary estate,

We see nothing strange in it.

All that

has happened is that the lessee has done something under the
lease and within the authority granted by the lease which is —
QUESTION:

In my example, I suppose that your zoning

laws probably would provide for notice to the landlord of what
was going to happen to the zoning rules, and he would have a
chance to appear and oppose.

Is there any similar notice here

that the landlord — I mean to the landlord about this lease,
what future burden there might be on his property if the gas
were sold in interstate commerce?
MR. BARNETT;

Well, there certainly was an opportunity

on behalf of the land — of the lessors in this case to inter»
vene in the Commission proceeding and, indeed, the record here
states that there was no protest, no intervention in the pro­
ceeding,
QUESTION:

How would they even know about It?

would they even know about the proceeding?

How

The zoning case

19

that you give us is a similar example»

They are entitled; as

a matter of right; to notice* aren't they?
MR» BARNETT:

I cannot assay on the record that the

lessors here knew of the proceeding.
QUESTION:

However* they —

There is no Commission procedure whereby

they would normally* in the normal routine* be given notice*
either* is there?
MR. BARNETT:
Mr. Justice Stevens.

I don't know whether there is or not*
I can say that when the second certificate

was granted back in 1962* I think it was* that by that time the
lessor certainly must have known that sales were being made in
the interstate market.

They were receiving royalties.

And the

record reflects that there was no protest or interven'd°h In
that proceeding either.

So it seems to me fair to assume that

this is not a problem of their not having had notice* and they
have not asserted that they did not have notice.
QUESTION:

I was just wondering how far you press

your hypothetical example* is all.
clearly entitled to it.

In one case* they are

In the other* they may or may not have

gotten it* depending on what the record might show.
MR. BARNETT:

As I said, they do not appear to contend

here that they didn't have notice of the Commission proceedings.
And so we would submit that that is simply a similar situation.
There is a case cited in El Paso’s brief at page 9* a New York
case* which supports a similar kind of consequence under the

20

zoning laws»
I would like to say a few things, finally, about the
consequences of this decision.; We submit that if this decision
below is not reversed it would substantially Impair the Commis­
sion^ regulatory authority over natural gas, it would undercut
the Commission!s ability fco assure an adequate and reliable
Supply of natural gas fco the nation, an ability which this
Court since the Phillips ease has striven to uphold,
QUESTION:

Can the Commission require that the lessor

join with the lessee in making an application to the Commission?
MR, BARNETT:
could do that.

For the future, I suppose, the Commission

That would not handle a lot of eases that have

already come up.

The Commission might find that if it did that

it would have less gas dedicated, but I suppose
QUESTION:

But that's the natural consequence of the

Phillips decision.
MPi. BARNETT:

I suppose the Commission could do that

for- the future.
It should be noted in the first place that there is
a lot of gas involved in this ease.

Respondents have belittled

the amount of gas Involved here, saying in their brief at page
14, ’’This case involves a miniscule fraction of the United
States marketed natural gas production." They don't cite that
miniscule fraction there.

They do cite it in their brief in

opposition fco the petition for certiorari, page 11, Note 7a and

21
that fraction is .08* that is 8/10’s of 1% of all the gas
production in the nation is involved in this ease* that is on­
shore and off-shore* 8/10!s of 1$.

We submit that that’s not

a miniscule amount.
QUESTION:

Is.that .08 over 100 or simply .08 decimal?

MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

Almost 1%?

MR. BARNETT:
1$.

It is .08 —

I am sorry* it must be almost 1/10 of

I will check that*. Mr. Justice Rehnqulsfc.

I am sorry.

As I said before* that is more than 1% of El Paso’s
total annual requirement.
The significance of this case is further illustrated
by the interests of the States of Texas* New Mexico and
Louisiana in it.

To them it is not a minor case.

Further, the

effect of the case would not be limited to fixed-tera leases.
It would* in fact* very possibly extend to the kind of lease
that is quite common and that 'was involved in the Pennzoil case
in the Fifth Circuit.

That was simply a typical life-of-the -

reserves lease* cited in our brief at pages 30 to 33* a lifeof-the-reserves lease providing for royalties to be paid from
the market value of the gas.
be intrastate market value.

The lessor insisted that this must
The state court upheld that and the

lessees applied to the Commission for an exception from the
Commission's celling price* arguing that they would have to
pay that higher rate.

And they argued that If they could not

22

pay that higher rate the lease would be terminated for failure
to pay the royalties.
The Commission responded that if the lease was termin­
ated* well* the lessors will still have to carry on the service*
citing the Commission's decision in the Southland case.

The

Fifth Circuit* however* in reversing the Commission in Pennsoil*
said that is not the case*

the Commission was operating on the

wrong legal premise in Southland in assuming that that gas was
trapped in the interstate market* as the Fifth Circuit put It,
Thus* it is quite possible that under such leases if the lessor
terminates for failure to pay the higher rate* the lessor is
then in control and under Texas property law* as Respondents
assert here* there is a separate estate which is not subject to
the interstate dedication,
I would like to reserve the rest of my time* please.

the court below is an attack on one of the fundamental prin­
ciples of the Natural Gas Act* in that it raises the central
issue of whether the Federal Regulatory Commission possesses
the jurisdiction* under the Natural Gas Act* to protect the

23
public's continuity of interstate service at reasonable rates.
Now,, my colleague has already referenced the
Congressional intent stated in Section 1(a) of the Act* that
the business of transporting and selling natural gas for ulti­
mate distribution to the public is effected with the public
interest.

We believe that Section 7* and specifically Section

7(b)* of the Natural Gas Act embodies the heart of that public
protection.

The essential meaning of the abandonment require»

menfc of Section 7(b) ie to protect the public from a loss of
gas in interstate service upon which it has come to rely.
California agrees with the statement of the 10th
Circuit Court of Appeals in the original Sunray case* at 239
F2d* 101* which states* "No single factor in the Commission's
duty to protect the public can be more important to the public
than the continuity of service furnished."
The Natural Gas Act does not deal expressly with the
Commission's jurisdiction over gas
expired lease.

which is the subject of an

We think that this particular circumstance makes

it entirely proper when deciding the Commission's jurisdiction*
in this particular instance* to look at the reason why the Act
was passed and the impact on the consuming public.
My colleague has already mentioned the immediate
impact of the loss of seme 25 million cubic feet a day of gas
from the interstate market,

This is gas that El Paso has

partially relied on in building gas facilities.

This is gas

24

that the consumer has partially relied on in putting gas appli­
ances In its homes.
We also agree with the statement that this decision
of the court below can foster reliance upon forms of leasehold
arrangements which, under the protection of local law* will
permit lessors to reenter into possession of gas reserves at
their discretion, ignoring the public interest and divert sup-*
plies from the interstate service,
today.

This is a very real threat

It is a real threat because of the difference and

divergence of gas prices in the intrastate market.

Obviously*

the interstate market is regulated and the intrastate market
isn’t. There is also a great shortage of gas in the interstate
market and there is not necessarily that shortage in the intra­
state market.
It Is in the Interest of the producers to be able to
leave the interstate market, at their discretion* in order to
make the best profit possible frcm this gas.

The question here

is whether the Comission will be foreclosed from exercising
any authority over interstate service of gas supplies covered
by the leases which terminate because of clauses in these
leases.
QUESTION:

You emphasise the reliance of consumers

on getting the equipment.

How did the consumers know that this

particular reserve was going to last even 50 years, let alone
beyond?

You don#fc really suggest that consumers go through a

25

process of reflection and analyze how long a particular area is
going to produce gas. do you?
MR. DEUTSCH:

Mr. Chief Justice, I do not.

believe that is the purpose for the Act.

And I

They have no way of

judging the specific dedication of gas.
QUESTION;

Then why did you rely on that?

You just

made an argument that consumers bought appliances and put in,
perhaps, I assume you meant household heating, because they
were depending on this supply.
MR. EEUTSCH:

I thought you made that argument,

Well, perhaps, I failed to say

thought I had •— that in partial reliance.

I

I was looking at it

in terms of the overall picture, that the consumers were relying
on a continuous and reliable stream of gas in interstate service,
And 1 believe that was one of the main purposes the Act was
passed and one of the main duties of the Natural Gas Act —
excuse me, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, because
the consumer cannot, himself, determine what each particular
gas contract might say.

It is up to the Federal Energy

Regulatory Commission to protect the consumer and the consumer’s
reliance on a reliable and continuous stream of gas.

That’s one

of the most important elements..
QUESTION;

What notice did the lessor have here 50

years ago that this would be the consequence?
MR. . ’EUTSCH:

The lessor did not have notice that

this would be the consequence

but I would submit that the

26

obligation to continue the certified service -is not one imposed
by the agreement between the lessor and the lessee.
posed by the Natural Gas Act.

It is im­

I would submit, and I think this

Court recognized in the Sun ray decision, that the idea of ser­
vice is something separate and apart, service of natural gas
to the public is something separate and apart from the agreement
which initiates that service.

And I would further submit that

this is part of the idea of public convenience and necessity,
that a particular agreement, in order to be certified initially,
has to be justified by the service to which it relates.

If

there is no justification in terms of the public interest,
then the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should not
certify that agreement in the first place.
So, in answer to your question, I would say that I
don't think it is necessary that the lessor have had notice
at the beginning of that 50 years.

In fact, I don't believe

the Natural Gas Act had been passed at that time.
QUESTION:

I am guessing also.

The lessor has to

put up with the prices, I guess, that the interstate market
sets, or the Commission sets for the interstate market, and
his royalties are figures on that, I suppose.
MR. wEUToCI-I;

Yes, Justice White.

I would add that

we must remember at the beginning of the lease tern Gulf, the
lessee, had the right to sell all of the gas under this reserve,
Eind I think he had a duty to get the best price for that reserve.

27-

not only for himself, but for the reversionary interest holders
which were receiving a royalty at that timeo
QUESTION:

What law would be the source of that duty?

State or federal?
MR, DEUTSCH:

I think that would be state law.

It

that

would be state law, but the point is that at/time it was in the
reversionary mineral interest owners' Interests for that gas to
be sold in Interstate commerce.

Today, it is in his interest

to have that gas sold in intrastate commerce.

But the question

is, under the Natural Gas Act, is it in the consumer's interest?
And under the theory of Southland the consumer's interest,which
the Natural Gas Act requires the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission to look at, could not be looked at at all.

The

continuing stream of gas would simply be terminated because the
1eas e terminated.
What, I think, the theory of the case is, is that now
the reversionary mineral interest owners receive not the royalty
interests but the entire sales price from this gas that is sold
in interstate commerce at a rate set by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission,
But I think that this Court, from the Phillips
Petroleum-Company y, Wisconsin case through the CATCQ and Sun ray
and Lo-Vaca cases,

has always recognized that there was a

Congressional intent to protect the consuming public fs continu­
ity of natural gas service at reasonable prices and has

28
determined, or reached decisions on the Natural Gas Act with
that in mind.
QUESTION:

Don't you think that Congress recognized

the same effect that this Court recognised in Phillips?
MR. DEUTSCH:

I think that this Court recognized the

basic fundamental intent of Congress to protect the consumer, in
passing the Natural Gas Act.
point.

I think that is a very important

I think the Southland would probably tell you that

without the Natural Gas Act, without regulation, there might be
more gas in the interstate market, and there might very well be.
But the point is Congressional intent was to protect the con­
suming public because, as Justice Brennan said in the Sunray
case, that 1 If the producers and pipelines

were left completely

free to determine when to enter and when to leave the market and
what prices to charge, without the Federal Power Commission
looking after their interests, there would be economic chaos at
the local level."
Mr. Chief Justice, my time is up.

Thank you,.very

much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Atwell.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF J, EVANS ATTWELL, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. ATTWELL:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

29

We have heard a great deal today about many reasons
why this Court should hold that Southland fs gas has been somehow
dedicated to El Paso in Interstate commerce, but I!ve heard
precious little about the Natural Gas Act,

And 1 agree with the

Chief Justice that the basic decision to be rendered by the
Court is the power of a lessee, through the Natural Gas Act,
to commit to interestate commerce the gas of Southland Royalty.
As 31 understand the Commission's position in this case,
it is that it concedes, one, that 'Southland has never dedicated
any of its Waddell Ranch gas to El Paso, and two, that under
universal common law,Gulf could not have dedicated Southland's
gas because Gulf and Southland owned two .separate and independent
interests.
Instead, the Commission claims that the Waddell Ranch
gas was involuntarily dedicated when Gulf made an interstate
sale of Gulf leasehold gas.

According to the Commission, this

dedication occurred as a matter of law under the Natural Gas
\

Act.
iSo, we see the case as boiling down to the fundamental
issue as to whether Congress intended for the Natural Gas Act
to abrogate established common law and empower private parties,
such as Gulf Oil Corporation,to dedicate gas it never owned,
never had any interest in and never intended to dedicate.
We submit that there is nothing in the Natural Gas
Act or its legislative history to suggest that Congress intended

such a radical result.

To the contrary, the plain language of

the Act shows that Gulf could not dedicate Southland's gas.
In considering this question of statutory construction.,
the Commission would have you focus on 7(b) of the Act, the
abandonment section.

That section provides that if a natural

gas company undertakes dedicated service it cannot abandon that
service without Commission authorization.
looking at the wrong section.

But the Commission is

7(b) merely begs the question,

because it applies to dedicated gas.

Here the question is

whether Southland's gas has ever been dedicated,

more particu­

larly, -whether Southland's gas -was somehow dedicated when Gulf
made an Interstate sale of Gulf gas.
QUESTION:

Was the lessee authorized to sell in the

interstate market under the lease?
MR. ATTWELL;
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, Justice White.

Was it required to, or would there have

been some breach of lease •—. breach of duty under the lease if
it just hadn’t sold anything?
MR, ATTWELL;

Well, he had a duty to market.

But he

could have sold on the interstate market or the intrastate
market.
QUESTION:

But he wasn't breaching the lease by

selling in the interstate market?
MR. ATTWELL:

No, sir, he was not.

The record in

this case does show, though, that there was a "'substantial

He wasn't breaching his lease by

MR* ATTWELL:

By making:a

sale of Gulf's gas in the interstate market, they were certainly
not breaching their lease.

In fact, in this particular lease,

Justice White, the royalty was payable on 4 cents per mcf for
1,000 feet, regardless of what Southlands itself got for its gas,
QUESTION:

Were any of these leases a percentage, or

not?
MR. ATTW&LL:

These leases

. No, the royalty was

32

based strictly on a rate of 4 cents.
In determining whether Gulf could dedicate Southland’s
gas, we submit that the proper section of the Act to be looked
at is Section 7(e)•

That section says that a certificate shall

be issued to any qualified applicant who is able and willing
properly to do the acts and perform the service.

7(e) makes it

clear that in order for a producer to dedicate gas to inter­
state service he must be able to perform the service.

Gulf was

never able at any time to perform the service selling Southland’s
gas, because Gulf never owned any interest in or had any right
or control over the disposition of Southland's gas.

Gulf
As the court below noted, in the present case,/at all

times lacked the legal ability to deliver any gas from
Southland's property after the expiration of its limited 50-year
term»
As to Gulf's willingness to dedicate Southland's gas,
I want to make sure that the Court realizes that Gulf's asser­
tion that it attempted no dedication of gas beyond the interests
it owned is undisputed on the record in this case.

Likewise,

there has been no challenge to Gulf's assertion that it did not
purport to dedicate the gas to SI Paso which it would not cwn
after the expiration of its lease.
According to the record, Gulf believed that any such
dedication would have been ineffective as a matter of law to
bind gasuthat it had no right to.

I make this point because

33
in the original argument it appeared there might be a mis­
conception that the record showed that Gulf intended or attempted
in its contract with El Paso and then its certificate application
to dedicate mere gas than it owned under its 50-year fixed-term
lease,

Such was not the case.
The fact that Gulf applied for and was issued a cer­

tificate of unlimited duration does not bear on whether Gulf was
able or willing to dedicate Southland's gas.

That simply meant

that Gulf was obligated to sell all the Waddell Ranch gas it
owned.

It didn't mean that Southland either sought or was

authorized to sell gas it didn't own.

Gulf sought a certificate

unlimited in time because its contract with El Paso covered not
only its limited interest In Waddell gas, but also gas from a
number of other sources, where the leases were not for a fixed
tern but for the life of the reserves.
As a result, Gulf delivered and is today delivering
very substantial quantities of gas from these other sources to
El Paso under this very same contract.

In fact, those volumes

of gas are substantially in excess of the volume of gas involved
In this case.
Nor was Southland's gas dedicated because the certifi­
cate issued to Gulf pursuant to Section 7(e) imposed a service
obligation separate and apart from the sales obligation imposed
by contract with El Paso.
Under 7(e), the service obligation imposed by the

3-4

producer’s certificate., extends to what the producer is able to
do, but does not extend to what he is not able to do.
QUESTION:

Do you know If the Commission could give

Gulf permission to terminate?

Let’s- forget about Southland.

Would the lessee be required to get permission to
terminate at the end of the lease?
MR, ATTWELL:

The lessee in this case* Gulf Oil

Corporation., has been required to file abandonment application.
It filed such an application more than two years ago,
QUESTION;

„.-o you think the Commission was within its

powers in doing that?
MR, ATTWELL:

Yes, I do.

It is, in full compliance

with
QUESTION;
rule0

As you say, it would be just a pro forma

The Commission would be obligated to give permission,
MR. ATTWELL:

Correct., Justice White, because Gulf's

supply of available gas has depleted to the extent that con­
tinuance of service is unwarranted.

Those are the words of

Section 7(h)* and that is our position.
In this case, Gulf’s service obligation was limited
to the Waddell Ranch gas it found and produced during the
defined 50-year term, of its lease, because that was the onlygas Gulf had any right to sell and deliver.

Thus, Gulf's

service obligation in no way was binding on Southland,
Let me illustrate by saying that in most instances

35
gas reserves are owned by a number of different producers,
If one owner in a gas reserve makes an interstate sale of his.
interests, his service obligation binds him to deliver all the
gas he owns, regardless of any limitations In his contract to
the contrary.

But this service obligation is in no way binding

on any of the other owners.

They are free to sell their inter­

ests in the gas to the purchaser of their choice.

We say that's

exactly the situation here.
Gulf made an interstate sale of its interest in the
Waddell Ranch gas.

The service obligation it incurred under its

certificate obligated Gulf to deliver, as It has done, all of
the Waddell Ranch gas It owned.

Gulf would have had this ob­

ligation even if Its contract with El .Paso had expired before
the termination of Its fixed-term lease.

But Gulf's service

obligation is in no way binding on Southland's entirely separate
interest in the Waddell Ranch gas, because Gulf was never
legally able to undertake any service of Southland's gas.
j. would like to now turn to several of the points
that Mr. Barnett made during the course of his opening presen­
tation.

The first I want to turn to is the question of reli­

ance which he mentioned and I believe also Mr. Deutsch men­
tioned „
Vie reject that claim entirely.

As the court below

noted, this claim of public reliance is supported — and I quote
—

!by neither fact nor authority.1'

None of the Commission's.

36
orders under review here are based upon any such alleged
reliance.

Moreover, there is absolutely no evidence in the

record to support a claim of public reliance.
QUESTION:

Congress didn’t need a claim of public

reliance when It enacted the Federal Power Act in 193^»

It

could just legislate under commerce power and tell owners of
oil royalties and oil pipelines

who had previously not been

subject to regulation that hereafter they were subject to
regulation.
MR, ATTWELL:

Well, there Is no question whether —

There might be a question, Justice Rehnquist, in my mind, if
Congress could do that if it encompasses that Congress could
tell A he could dedicate B's gas.

But, aside from the fact

putting that aside, Congress could certainly, in effect, assert
jurisdiction over producers and lessors.
QUESTION:

And the fact that It happened before would

be no defense to that assertion.
MR. ATTWELL:

That is correct.

And I think that

really gets back to where we started from, and that is what
Congress did in the Natural Gas Act, and what the plain words
of the Act say when read in a ccmafton-sense fashion.
QUESTION:

.joes your response embrace intrastate as

well as Interstate?
MR. ATTWELL:

You mean the fact that Congress could

I believe they could.

I know there are some that

take the position to the contrary, but I believe that a showing
could be made by Congress ~~
QUESTION:

Under the General Welfare Clause, not

the Commerce Clause.
MR, ATTWELL:

I believe that also, probably, the

effect that the Intrastate market has on the interstate market
vjould be a basis for Congress asserting Jurisdiction on that
basis,
I want to point out that Southland did not ratify
Gulf Interstate,dedication of Gulf gas to the interstate market
by accepting royalties,

An opinion of more than six years

ago by Judge Levanthal of the D.C. Circuit pointed out that a
royalty owner is not a natural gas company subject to Commission
jurisdiction.

Because he Is a landowner, he simply enters into

a lease for the exploration and development of his land., and
that transaction is clearly not a jurisdictional one and that
likewise a royalty owner does not make a sale of gas in inter­
state commerce because he has no control over the sale, one
way or the other.
The Commission also contends that Southland 's gas
was somehow dedicated to interstate service in this case because

38
, a

continuing flow of Gulf gas could not be interrupted with­

out 7(b) abandonment authorization.

First, let me say that the

record is unequivocal and clear that Southland has never made
a sale of its gas in interstate commerce, except under compul­
sion of the orders that are under review.

But we don't have a

situation where Southland's gas has been flowing in interstate
commerce and because of the flow the Commission can assert Jur­
isdiction,

The basic fallacy, though, in the Commission's

argument is that the only physical flow that Gulf could and did
dedicate tc Interstate service
5C-year flow.

was Gulf's leasehold gas, a

And as this Court made clear in Sun ray, once

Gulf's gas commenced to flow, that supply could not be with­
drawn from continued interstate movement without permission.
Of course, Gulf didn't withdraw that supply.
delivered all of its leasehold gas.

Instead, Gulf has

Therefore, Gulf's supply,

the only supply which ever has flowed in interstate commerce,
is gone, and in the words of Section 7(b). it's been depleted
"to the extent that continuance of service is unwarranted."
As to the basis for asserting jurisdiction because
of what are essentially policy witnesses, I believe that
Mr. Justice Rehnquist put his finger on the question about this
proliferation of short-term leases If Southland prevails in this
case

when he said that clearly the Commission has the power and

can require all the necessary information so as to determine
whether or not a proposed sale involves such a lease, and if so

39
to take appropriate action to protect the public interest.
QUESTION:

you mean that will be the consequence

.00

if Southland prevails or if it does not prevail?
MR. ATTWSLL:

We say that if Southland prevails there

are not going to be any short-tern leases because they are not
economically feasible, that many, many years ago, back in the
late 1920s these leases became extinct because producers are
just not going to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars or
millions of dollars drilling wells if they won't be able to
produce any gas they find for two or three years, or whatever
the defined term is.

But that even if it should happen that

there were short-term leases,the Commission clearly has it
within its power to require regulations that a lessee show the
:erm of his lease and then the Commission can take such action
as it deems appropriate to protect the public interest.
QUrbTION:

Would you explain that a little bit more

to me.

What could they do?

bay a lessee came In with a 10-year

lease.

What could the Commission do to be sure it would have a

longer source of supply?
MR. ATW.CLL:

Justice Stevens, the Commission could say,

"We are not going to certificate this sale unless you get the
lessor to join."

The Commission, could say that "We are going

to just refuse the sale altogether.

We don't think it is in

the public interest to have that." Or thirdly, it could condi­
tion the sale on an unlimited term certificate just as the

Commiss ion did in Sunray.
QUESTION:

Isn't this certificate unlimited in

duration in this ease?
MR. ATTWSLL:

This certificate is.

In this certifi­

cate,. the service obligation that was imposed by this certificate
as I spoke to a minute ago,, Gulf's service obligation is limi­
ted to Gulf's ability to perform.

And Gulf's ability to perform

here was limited to its leasehold gas.

And under its lease*

the only gas that Gulf was entitled to was the gas that it
actually produced during the specified 50-year - term.

So that

the fact that Gulf got an unlimited term certificate really
made no difference.

It didn't affect., in other words, Southland

as far as we are concerned.
As a second policy reason, the Commission speculates
that dedicated reserves may somehow be released from interstate
commerce because of the reasoning or the theory of the Fifth
Circuit in this case.

They say that such theory may be applied

where a lease grants a producer the right to dedicate gas.

He

dedicates the gas and then his lease is prematurely terminated
before all of the dedicated gas has been produced.

They par­

ticularly refer to the typical life reserve lease which provides
that it will remain in effect so long as the reserve maintains
production *
We do not believe that the reasoning of the Fifth
circuit applies to such a situation.

In his opinion,

41

Justice Clark was very careful to emphasize that under its lease
Gulf at no time was possessed of rights in the Waddell Ranch
gas that could extend beyond the 50-year term of its lease.
Therefore, it is clear, we believe, that the decision below is
based on the fact that Gulf never -- I emphasize the word
"never1

had any interest in or control over Southland’s gas.

In fact, that's the basis on which the Tenth Circuit subsequently
distinguished this case, when it affirmed orders of the Commis­
sion, holding that gas of the Phillips Petroleum Company was
dedicated to interstate commerce.
The Commission, in fact, in the Pennzoll case
mentioned by the Commission counsel, has gone even further and
taken the position that the reasoning in this case actually
supports the position that when a life of reserve lease
prematurely terminates,the Interstate dedication of reserves
prior to such termination continues in effect.
In any event, when this Court is faced with a case
involving the premature determination of a typical life reserves
lease, it may well conclude that because the producer, under
such a lease, has the power to dedicate 100$ of this gas re­
serves and did so dedicate them before his lease terminated,
any such gas remains dedicated despite the lease termination.
Such a holding would be entirely consistent with
holding for Southland based on the facts of this case.

All the

Court need hold here, and all that we believe the Fifth Circuit

42

held, Is that one who has never had any interest in or control
over gas cannot dedicate that gas to interstate service.

Of

course, if there is any question in the Court's mind as to the
extent of the decision below, it can and should limit it to the
issues presented by the facts of this case, which is whether
one who never had an interest In or control over gas can dedi­
cate that gas to interstate service.
QUESTION:

Suppose the Natural Gas Act said on its

face that when any gas is dedicated by lessee that, as a matter
of law, the entire gas supply is dedicated to interstate market,
unless there is consent of the Commission.

Suppose the Gas Act

said that and tomorrow a lease is entered into and a lessee
dedicates gas,

bo

you think you could bind the lessor in a

manner like that, or no?
MR. ATTWELL:

Well, first, of course, it is our

position that the Act doesn't say that.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

MR. ATTWeLL:
QUiaTIOM:

But, I believe as long ---

I am just responding to your general

statement that a lessee could never have authority to dedicate
gas that he doesn't own.
MR. ATTWBLL:

I think that that is probably right,

because under the Natural Gas Act, as it now stands, the
Commission cannot force someone to sell their own gas in inter­
state commerce.

43
QUESTION:

The lessee comes in, though, and says,

"I

want to dedicate," and the law, on its face, says this will be
taken as so and so.

And the lessor has authorized him to sell

in Interstate commerce.
MR. ATTWELL:
QUESTION:

The lessee says that he —

The lease says on its face that he can sell

it anywhere he wants to.
MR, ATTWELL:

But ycu are saying the Act is also

amended to provide that when the lessee makes the sale

Well,

of course, if the lease was entered into at the time that he
had notice, then it might be a different —
QUESTION:

Let's just suppose the lessor had notice

of the law, of what the law was, and he entered into the lease,
do is he bound?
MR. ATTWELL:

I would say he had given his implied

consent in that instance.

Of course, in this Instance, we have

no notice whatsoever.
QUESTION: The lessee is then dedicating gas in which
he has no interest.
MR, ATTWELL:

But the lessor, by entering into the

lease with knowledge of the law as it is, giving his implied
consent to the lessee to sell his gas in interstate commerce,
it is kind of an agency argument, in other words.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. ATTWELL:

And we don't have that here.

I believe

that this morning, or this afternoon, the Government said that
they are not relying on any type of agency concept.
I do want to mention two other points that Mr.Barnett
brought up.

First, he read from part of the brief we filed with

the Commis si or, as to once gas being dedicated it remains dedi­
cated.

But he quit there.

Because the next sentence says,

"But this legal conclusion begs the question of whether gas
attributable to the interest of the mineral estate of mineral
interest owners has been dedicated to interstate commerce.''
And then we went on to answer another question that
was asked this morning,and that is the effect of this Court’s
decision in California y. Lo-Vaca,

We said that reliance on

that decision is totally misplaced because there has been no
physical movement of any gas attributable to our min@?al estate.
A question was asked of Mr.. Barnett:

Could southland

have come in and blocked, in effect, Gulf’s certificate appli­
cation?

Of course, Southland had no idea that it would ever

be claimed that Gulf was attempting to dedicate Southland’s gas.
But, in any event, in this case, the record shows that
the Commission told the Fifth Circuit, and I quote, "That
Southland Royalty could not prevent Gulf's total dedication of
surplus residue gas to nil Paso."
As to the Commission’s analogy to an ancient covenant
running with the land, we find that unusual, that that analogy
doesn't bene;cit them.

Under common law, a covenant is not

45
binding on anyone who is not a successor to the covenantor.
And, In this case, the decision of the Texas Supreme Court In
1973> made it crystal clear that Southland had a separate, in­
dependent estate that was vested at all times, and that
Southland is in no way a successor to Gulf.
In conclusion, let me say that we think that this
case is based on two basic principles still, and that is, one,
that you can’t dedicate what you don’t own, and two, that Gulf
Oil never owned any interest in Southland's gas, never had any
right in that gas and never had any control over it.

And that,

therefore, Southland 's gas was not dedicated to interstate
service when Gulf made an interstate service of Gulf's gas.
For these reasons, we ask that you affirm the decision
below.
Thank you.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Attorney General,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN L, HILL, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF TEXAS
AS AMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF RESPONDENTS
MR. HILL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may It please the

Court:
The K-tate of Texas, for reasons that we have outlined
in our amicus brief, joins in most of the basic arguments that
have been presented by southland.

I would not want us to be in

46
agreement here,
case.

Not that it is material to the decision in this

We would not want to be in agreement that Congress could
N.

authorize a lessee to contract gas that it did not own* nor
would we want to be in agreement concerning any Congressional
authority to control intrastate gas,
Since neither one of those matters are, in our
opinion, essential to the issue here, let me turn to Section
7(b) which is the heart of this case and state why the State of
Texas cares about this casei and what our interest is, as we
conceive it, in sustaining the Circuit Court's decision in
overturning the Federal Power Commission order in this case.
Section 7(b), as we have been over and over* speaks
of ‘'No natural gas company shall abandon all or any portion of
its facilities, subject to the jurisdiction of the Commissi

"

Nox*;, we say, first, that the Congressional intent,
i

as well as a clear reading of Section 7(h), would require you
to hold In this case that Southland Royalty is not a natural j
gas company, within the meaning of 7(b), that Gulf is the
only natural gas company that would come within that definition
or meaning.
Then, when it says "facilities," we ask that you hold
that facilities contemplated in this case are only the lease
that Gulf took — Its lease, that that's the facilities* .the 50year term lease -- or .that that would be the facilities in any
interpretation of 7(h), the lease taken by the lessee.

And

47
that the service intended is the gas covered by that lease and
not any other gas, not any reversionary interest of anyone else,
and that it is a misreading of the Federal Poiver Commission Act
to say that the mere dedication of a lessee's interest to inter­
state service, in some way not ever stated by Congress, would
then mean that as long as that gas were flowing it would also
authorize the bringing in under that service, or that facility,
gas which the lessee didn't even own in the first place, or
would extend the gas that was found after that particular lease
were abandoned,
We say that is a total misreading and a stretching of
the Federal Power Commission authority, and that if Congress
intends that it should say so.

And then, and only then, would

we be facing the issue that's being inquired about in some of
the questions.

And we would certainly want to raise consti­

tutional objection to it» But that is not here^ it is not.
intended.

And the reason that we are concerned with any

rule that would emanate from this case la as abroad as the Federal
Power Commission order.

And let me refer to it again.

It says,

"The duty to continue to serve is like an ancient covenant
running with the land.

Now, that's --

QUkJTION:

Or a new covenant.

MR. HILL':

New, ancient or middle-aged.

It is to us a very, very novel doctrine with no
authority to support it and totally unprecedented in universal

48
lav,'.

And that has to bother us because we own 16 million acres

of land in our state, the State of Texas does.
away our largest landowner.

We are far and

We have 4,000 expired leases that

we have discovered just since 1944, covering over 2 million
acres of land in our state.

That's just for openers, that's

just what we could find going over the general land office for
purposes of this case.

And when you are faced with the possi­

bility of a rule about a covenant running with the land that
could mean that the interstate dedication would extend beyond
the lessee's Interest, whether or not there had been an. abandon
ment, you can see why our state would be very concerned and the
havoc that that could cause, not only — because most of these
abandonments have not been carried out, it would mean that
people trying to do business with us would find --- it would
mean, certainly, that people that are trying to deal with the
State of Texas in taking these leases, if they had no way of
knowing

and they don't.

You can't find these contracts that

are made and utilized for interstate service.
recorded in any courthouse anywhere.

They are not

You can't find them.

You could come up here and dig around in the FCC files, if you
wanted to be that diligent, but we haven't found their files to
be all that up to date.

It would place a tremendous burden to

try to run down all those gas contracts.

And how are you going

to know when some contract -- the lease is down there, but you
can't go find every unexpired lease..

Vie found land where there

;_;.9

are nine unexpired leases.

How are you going to know whether in

some prior lease, 25 or 30 years ago, maybe someone had a dedi­
cation of some gas to an interstate market, then the gas
trickled out and the lease expired and someone went on to the
next deal?

>o you mean that whan we are going to deal with

people now to get new leases to encourage them to go out and
drill these deep wells and have this exploration, that they've
got to try to determine whether someone years ago might have
had some lease under which there was some sale of gas in an
Interstate market, and by that be bound now to sell their gas
regardless of the circumstances in the interstate market?
You can see the tremendous dampening influence that
would have on exploration at a time when we are all trying to
encourage exploration.

And you can see the cloud that it would

put over titles and our ability as landowners to do business.
That's why the rule should be, plainly and simply, as the
Circuit Court has put it.
only what he owns.

And that is that the lessee can sell

That's always been the law.

That should

remain the law for the purpose of deciding this case before us.
There is nothing else that Gulf had except 50 years to sell.
That's the gas they had.
QUESTION:

That's --

Nobody is trying to sell the lessor's gas.

It is just a question of whether he must.stay'in the interstate
market.
MR. HILL:

Well, you see, there was never any

50
authorization.
QUESTION:

I understand* but nobody is suggesting that

Gulf has the right to sell the lessor’s gas.
MR. HILL:

Well* if you leave it in interstate --

QUESTION:

X know* but it will still be the lessor

selling it.

MR, HILL:

Not if it is an involuntary sale.

QUESTION:

I know* but it will still be him selling

It wouldn’t be Gulf selling it.
MR. HILL:

Well. Gulf would be* in effect* forcing

Southland to sell its gas whether it wanted to or not.
QUESTION:

If the law was construed as the Commission

says* it would be the law that's making the lessor stay in the
interstate market.

Gulf is out.

MR» HILL:

By what law?

QUESTION:

I understand your position on that* but

nevertheless it would be — Gulf would be out and the lessor
would be in* and the lessor would be making the sale.
MR. HILL:

The lessor wouldn’t have one thing in the

world to do — It would just be an involuntary forcing of
Southland to sell its gas in the interstate market.
QUESTION:

And at those prices.

MR. HILL:

Yes* sir,.

is not the issue here.

We are not worried -- The price

California talks about its consumers*

talks about how many homes it will heat in California* and it

talks about losing gas.

They have no gas to lose,, because this

gas was never dedicated into interstate service beyond the 50year term.

Southland didn't dedicate its gas.
They are begging -- They are bootstraplng themselves..

They are just begging the question when they say -QUESTION:

The issue in the case is that in what

market may the gas be sold* I gather.
MR. HILL:

And we say that Southland has the right

to sell it to Texas, and we are here to say that it's our gas

Their rights have been exhausted under the only

QUESTION:

Nobody is suggesting Gulf's rights are

going to go on.
QUESTION:

General Hill* is that quite right?

If

the Commission is correct in holding that it was like a covenant
running with the land and the landlord's gas is permanently
dedicated* why would not the Commission have the power to deny
Gulf's petition for abandonment and keep Gulf in the picture?
Because they would still have a source of supply.
MR, HILL:

You see* Gulf had filed an abandonment,

QUESTION:

If the supply is still available* they may

deny the petition for abandonment, may they not?
MR. HILL:

Why don't they act on It?

That's a very

good question,
QUESTION;

Is it perfectly clear that Gulf is. out of

the picture if the gas is still there?
MR, HILL:

Abs olutely.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you. Mr. Attorney

you have anything further., Mr. Barnett?

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. BARNETT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR, BARNETT:

Just a few points, Mr, Chief Justice.

First, in response to Mr. Justice Rehnquist, with
respect to that fraction that I fumbled,
That is nearly 1/10 of 1%.

It is .08 of 1%.

And, as I said, that's more than

1% of El Paso's firm annual requirement.

With respect to Mr. Attwell's argument that the ease
is really based on Lection 7(e), not 7(h)j because Gulf was not
able and willing to initiate the service, there are several
answers to that.

One is that it contradicts the certificate.

The certificates granted to Gulf said precisely that Gulf is
able and willing to perform the service, arid these certificates
were unlimited in time, not limited to the
QUESTION:

50

years of the lease.

Mr, Barnett, do you agree that if the

Commission is right, Gulf may remain in the picture permanently,

53
until the well expires?
MR, BARNETT:
QUESTION:

Not permanently.

Well, until the well is exhausted then,

MR. BARNETT:

No, we do not take the position that

the Commission could make Gulf sell Southland's gas permanently.
The Commission held that Gulf must seek abandonment.
QUESTION:

Yes, I know, but they would have power to

deny the petition for abandonment as long as there was still gas
available in the well, would they not?
MR. BARNETT:

Well, so long as they also had power

to deny Southland's petition.
QUESTION:

Sure, but If they had the power over

Southland, it would follow a fortiori, would it not, 'that they
could keep Gulf in the picture?
MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

Yes, so long as Southland was there.

Why do you say that?

Can't the lessor,

even though he has to stay in the interstate market, at least
get rid of his lessee?
MR, BARNETT:

Well, I think that's true, too, but

the Commission —
QUESTION:

Well, it can't be both ways.

MR. BARNETT:

Well, somebody else could be substi­

tuted .
QUESTION:

Substituted?

What if the lessor says,

Like whom?
"The lease Is expired,

I

understand that I ha.ve to stay In the interstate market, but I
don't want to deal with Gulf any more."
MR9 BARNETT:

Well, In that case, that's what I had

In mind when I said the lessor could bring In someone other
than Gulf,
QUESTION:

What about itself, Southland?

MR, BARNETT:
QUESTION;

I think Southland, itself, cou3.d ?»-

If it were equipped?

MR* BARNETT:

Yes, I think Southland, itself, could

be substituted for Gulf, If necessary*

But the point is that

Southland ultimately is the natural gas company by virtue of
\

having succeeded to this dedicated service in natural gas.
QUESTION:

But if Southland Is a bunch of doctors

sitting in Los Angeles, they are not going to want to start
building a pipeline in the south*
MR* BARNETT:

Well, you don't have to build a pipe­

line to be a seller of natural gas, Mr, Justice Rehnquist.
There are many owners who have no facilities in the sense of
pipes, or anything, but which are natural gas companies under
the Act, because they are engaged in sales of natural gas.
Indeed, we would say the reserve, itself, is the.facility, if
you need a facility*
QUESTION;

On the last day of the 50th year,

Mr, Barnett, why is any petition for abandonment necessary.
What does Gulf have to abandon?

55
MR* BARNETT:

Gulf has a continuing service which it

is still performing, and as the Commission said -QUESTION:

How can it perform anything under a lease,

after it has expired?
MR, BARNETT:

All the Commission said was that ''We

are requiring Gulf to seek abandonment, so that we would have
all the parties before us if we have to rearrange their legal
arrangements."
QUESTION:

Could they order Southland to make a new

lease with Gulf?
MR* BARNETT:

They could order Southland to make a

lease with somebody to continue selling,
QUESTION:

I am sure it is not intentional, but you

have given contradictory answers to Justice White and to
Justice Stevens.

To say that the Commission can rearrange the

legal arrangements of the parties.

That's a rather strange

notion to emanate from the statute, isn't it?
(

MR. BARNETT:

Well, to make clear that Southland is

required to continue this service which Gulf has begun under
the lease.

The Commission said, "We need all the parties

before us if we are going to"

I think it said,

'resettle their legal arrangements."

'rearrange -

But the point is that

Southland contends that it does not have to sell its gas in
i nterstate commerce.

The Commission would be telling it that it

does, that Is, a rearrangement of the legal arrangement, at leas

s o out-hland v Iews It.
QUESTION:

Jo you take the position, MiU Barnett,that by

virtue of Gulf’s dedication.the Commission acquires greater powerover Southland than it does over Gulf?
Ml, BARNETT:

In" the sense that after the 50 years

;Lt now has power to require Southland to sell the gas -~
QUESTION:

But does it also have power to require

Gulf to stay in the picture, assuming, you are right on Southland?
>

MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

To stay in the picture —

As lessee.

MR, BARNETT:

Not If Southland wants another lessee.

But if Gulf’s being in the picture is necessary to effect —
QUESTION;

It doesn’t have the poxver to deny the

petition for abandonment, even though the source of supply re­
mains available.

That’s your position?

MR. BARNETT:

No, it has the power to deny the

petition for Gulf's abandonment or to require Gulf to file its
petition, as it did here,
QUESTION:
it deny it?

It has filed it.

That's my question,

If it acts on it, can’t

woes the Commission have the

power to a) hold that Southland's gas must remain available, and
b) 'Ve are going to deny Gulf's petition for abandonment.' Joes it
have such power?

Yes,

Can the Commission say,, "Here are three names.

Yes.

be the same thing here.

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose at least one reason for

about that.

That may be one reason, yes.

—

standing,
