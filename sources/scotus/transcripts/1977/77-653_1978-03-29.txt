MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: We’ll hear arguments next
in Swisher against Brady.
Mr. Nilson* I think you may proceed when you're
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE A. WILSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. NILSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, end may it please the

Court:
I am here seeking reversal of the opinion of the
three-judge federal court below which held that Maryland's
juvenile jus-dee system of delinquency hearings before a master,
with review available from the juvenile court judge by way of
exception, offends the constitutional bar against double
jeopardy.
Under Maryland's present statutes and rules governing
juvenile - court proceedings, most of the more populous local
jurisdictions in Maryland, as well as some of the rural counties,
employ Masters for the purpose of conducting various hearings
within the juvenile court system.

The utilization of these

Masters, which also characterises the juvenile justice systems
of approximately 34 other States, is designed both to assist
the Circuit Court system in dealing with the extremely heavy
caseload in fths juvenile area, and also to provide for the
involvement in the process of persons who, by virtue of their

4
interest, expertise and permanent assignment: to the juvenile
court system can bring to bear in th© disposition of juvenile
causes a familiarity with and sensitivity to the special
needs and problems of juveniles charged with committing acts
in violation of the State's criminal laws.
Under Maryland's system, the juvenile court judge
hears originally all petitions for waive of jurisdiction to the
criminal courts for trial as adults.

And also generally

hears originally th© more aggravated charges, such as murder,
rape or armed robbery? as well as cases where exceptions to a
Master's proposal are anticipated in advance of the proceedings.
With certain other limited exceptions, other
delinquency cases, including arraignment, detention, adjudica­
tion and disposition, may be assigned for the hearing of
«

»

*

evidence to or.® of the full-time Masters employed by the
court.
Under both th© statute and under Maryland Rule 911,
when a Master conducts an adjudicatory and a disposition
hearing, he is required to transmit his proposed findings of
fact, conclusions of law and recommendations, and proposed
>

disposition orders to th© juvenile court judge within ten days
of the conclusion of th© disposition h©aringe
QUESTIONS

Are there two judges and seven Masters

in Baltimore County?
MR. NILSONx

In Baltimore City there is on® judge and

5

seven. Masters.
QUESTION:

One and seven.

MR. NILSONs That is correct.

In the other counties

th© ratio more closely approximates on© to one, the figures
both as to judges and Masters, I think, are given in our bri©f.
QUESTION:
MR. NIL-SON:

Unh-hunh.
Beth the statute and th© rule provide

that these proposed findings, conclusions and recommendations
do not constitute orders or final action of th© court,.

And

that final adjudication and disposition orders are only ©ntereu
by the juvenile court judge following his consideration of
any exceptions which may b© filed within fiv© days, or, if
no exceptions are filed, following his concurrence in th©
Master’s recommendations, if h© agrees with them.
QUESTION:

What would happen under Maryland law if

the Master simply, by mistake, failed to transmit his findings
to th© juvenile court judge?

Could the State go out and

incarcerate the juvenile, on the basis of th© Master's finding?
MR. NILSON:

He could not. There would b© no order

of the court, on the basis of which th© State could act.
Thar© would have been no disposition of that case.

If, there

had been no transmittal of th© findings and no ordars, no
order entered.
The only officer

in th© court system with the power

to enter an order disposing of the case and providing for a

6

dis p os I'cion of that: juvenile is fch© judge»
Now, in terms of tee submission of recommendations
and findings, while, as I’ve just indicated, the rule and the
statute do require fchat those recommendations and the findings
of fact be transmitted to the judge, that is frequently waived
by the parties. And this is pointed out on a number of occasions
in the appellees’ brief.

That occurs in situations where the

parties essentially are acquiescing in the Master’s proposed
disposition of the case, which h© announces after hearing,
and they will say that —
QUESTION;
MR. NILSON:

But still an order —
Pardon me?

QUESTION; Still an order is entered, signed by fch©
judge in those cases?
MR. NILSON;

Still an order is entered, signed by

the judg.
QUESTION; Signed by the judge?
MR. NILSON;

That’s correct.

While, understandably, few recommendations were disturbed by tee juvenile court judge in the absence of exceptions
by either the State or the juvenile court.

The judge does

have the authority, sua sponte, to either remand to the Master
for further hearing, to himself hold a non-evidentiary hearing,
or to himself hold a supplemental evidentiary hearing if
both fch© State and the juvenile agree to the taking of addi-

7
tional ©videuce.
This case focusas on the double--jeopardy implications
of the review of the Master's recommendation on the filing of
exceptions thereto by the State.

Appellees argue that regard­

less of the basis for the exceptions and regardless of whether
additional evidence is heard by the judge with the consent of
all parti.es, including the juvonile, or whether the judge's
review is solely on the record, the juvenile is placed in
jeopardy at £h© evidentiary adjudicatory hearing before the
Master, that that jeopardy concludes on the filing of the
Master's recommendations, and that any consideration given by
way of review of the juvenile court judge upon the filing of
an exception by the State to a Master's recommendation of a
non-delinquency finding constitutes a new and impermissible
second jeopardy.
Obviously the State disagrees with all of fch© elements
of that position taken by the appellees.
QUESTIONs What consequence can flow from th© Master's
actions before the judg© has acted on it?
MR. NILS ON s

la a situation where a Master has

adjudicated that the child committed an act and is proposing
detention of th© child, for example?
QUESTIONS

Yes.

MR. NILSON: There may b@ certain consequences with
respect to a contemporary continuation of a detention that is

8
already in pine©, pending the disposition, of the matter, but
no separata —
QUESTION:

No final disposition?

NII-SCv::

can't you > «vase rail z© about that?
■v' . WILSONs

X think that in the majority of ca3i:v

they ar© not, but I'm not certain I could generalise on that.
QUESTIONS

Help me out on another thing.

It’s the

san® judge involved in 'the comities and in the cities?
MR. NILSON:

It would be different judges involved.

QUESTION:

No, no.

I mean, in Baltimore City you’ve

got on©?
MR. NILSON;

That’s correct. There’s a specially

assigned juvenile judge *—
QUESTION: So, after the Master’s report# it goes
back to the same judge,* am I right?
MR. WILSON:

All Master’s reports go to a single

judge, that’s correct,
QUESTION:

In this c&sse all we’re • talking about is

on® j udge.
MR. WILSON: That is correct.

I think Judge

Kaoranarman was the juvenile judg© in Baltimer® City "for soma
©ight years, and then Judge Kazwacki, and there’s evidence

9
from both of those two judges in the record.
The appellees' initial attack on the

Maryland

system culminated in the decision of the Maryland Court of
Appeals in the Matter of Anderson in 1974, and because there
ar© several prior proce ridings in this cas© that are relevant
I thought it best to just das crib© them briefly to the Court.
In that case certain juveniles challenged the pro­
visions of what was then Maryland Rul® 908 and is now 911,
which authorized the state to file exceptions to a Master's
recommendation of non-delinquency.

Contending therms that the

provision for a d© novo hearing before the juvenile court judge
violated applicable double-jeopardy principles. At that time
the rules did permit a de novo hearing upon exception by the
State.
Assuming, in correct anticipation of this Court's
decision in Breed vs. Jones,

idle double-jeopardy principles

apply to adjudications of delinquency in juvenile court,
Maryland's Court of^Appsals rejected the challenge to the
rul© permitting exceptions by the State on the grounds that
the juvenile Master is a ministerial and not a judicial officer,
that under the Maryland Constitution he is entrusted with no
part, of tha judicial power of fch© State, that his recommendations
are only that and do net b@come binding unless and until approvs id
by the judge, and that, accordingly, a hearing before the
Master is not such a hearing that places a juvenile in jeopardy

10
at the time that heard Jig occurs,
Following that decision, review of which was denied
by this Court for want of a substantial federal question,
the appellees filed this case and companion habeas corpus
petitions in the U, S, District Court for the District of
Maryland.
The habeas cases wer© heard and decided first,
resulting in an opinion in June of 1975, in Aldridge vs. Dean,
concluding that the ability of th© States to file ©Kcepfcions to
the Master's finding and to obtain & d© novo adjudicatory
hearing before a judge, again under th© former version of the
Maryland rule, violated th© rights of juveniles not to b®
tele© placed in jeopardy for the'same offeas©»
Immediately following the decision in th© habeas
cases, the Maryland Court of Appeals adopted amended juvenile
court rules, which explicitly affirmed the holding in Matter
of Anders on that til® Master’s recommendations ar@ proposed only
and are not binding ©r final orders of th® court.
The new rules also denied' to th© State, when it takes
exception t© th© Master's recommendation, th© opportunity to
©due© any new evidence before the juveni1© court judg® without
the consent ©f th© juvenile.
Moreover, th© juveni1® court statute effective
July 1, '75, required for th© first time that proceedings
before the Master be reported, thus making possible meaningful

11
review by tee juveni1© court judge on the record

developed

before the Master.
Appellees then filed a supplemental complaint in this
case, alleging a vi*l& ;i .•:• <• i double- jeopardy, no twites i.* •;--.«j
the changes in the rules, additional evidence was introduced
and the. opinion below £©ll*waci in September of 5 77.
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, one point along with

the other one I ask.-id:

If the judge tries the case without

th© Master, and says *’I find no evidence of guilty” and "I
quit" &nd "I rele&s©” or whatever the ruling is? there’s
noticing the State can do?
MR. NILS ON t Well, tiiar©* a nothing further within the
State court system, that’s correct.
QUESTION: There's nothing the State can do.
MR, NILSON:

There’s nothing *— I don’t believe —*

there1 s no appeal to —*
QUESTION:

But if the Master — I 'think that’s tee

point the other side is making, I wanted to gat your view on
it — if tee Master recommends that he b© released, then the
State can file exception?
• *

MR. NILSON: The State can 'file exceptions with tee
juvenile, court judge? that’s correct.'
QUESTION:

And the reason teat your answer ~~

excuse me —*
QUESTION*

Go right ahead.

12
QUESTIONt

— to ' my brother Marshall's first

question, there's nothing a State can do if the judge finds
no delinquency or whatever it is.
State lav;»

You said as a matter of

Well, it's a matter of constitutional double-j©opar3y

law, isn't it?
MR. NILSON:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
Because h© just cannot be -- the. juvenile

could not be subjected to jeopardy before that judge for th©
iam® offense again»
MR. NILSON: That's right.

You could not

the

State —
QUESTION:
MR. NILSON;

That’s why.
— could not then take fch&t juvenile,

for example, and do what was don© in Bread vs. Jones,

which is

to attempt to try him in the adult court.

QUESTION:
MR. NILSON:

Right.
Or anywhere.
Or anywhere.

Nor do I think they could

go up end attempt to seek a reversal and bring it back down
for a retrial or reconsideration back in the juvenile court
system.
But what we've got her© is confined entirely within
th® juvenile c;urt system at the lower court level.

And w©

would submit, assentially, is on© continuous proceeding.
Now, there ara two parts to th© State’s argument on the double-

13
jeopardy potato
The first; is that: essentially jeopardy does not
attach at th© hearing before the Master, and the basis for
that is that he is not the trier of fact, with authority to
enter a judgment of conviction or acquittal or th® equivalent
thereof.
QUESTION:

At what point d© you fix its attach­

MRo NILSON:

Jeopardy would attach at th® moment

ment?

that that case file, th© record in that case, that th© evidence
— that th© recommendations of th® Master are given to th©
juveniles court judge*
QUESTIONs

Even before he signs an order?

MR., NILSON: That is correct»

One© that is b©for©

th® judge, then essentially evidence is before th© trier of
fact, that off!car who has authority to enter an order of
guilt or innocence or delinquency or non---delinquency in the
cas©.

'
QUESTION: But then. General Nilson, is it your view

that tea St&t© could pomplet© its presentation of evidence
before th© Master and lose, fend teen instead of filing
exceptions it would decide to start over and get son® more
evidence?
MR, NILSON: Before — when you say "lose", you mean
the Master?

14
QUESTION:

Let’s say the Master rtiakss a recommenda­

tion of ao finding of delinquency. And then instead of taking
exception to that, I take it your view is the Stats could say,
wlet's go back and get some more witnesses and have another
hearing”.
MR» NILSON:

Well, that is, I suppose, theoretically

possible under the part of our argument that says that jeopardy
would —
QUESTION:
MR» NILSON:
correct»

Under the first part of your argument.
Until it gets to the judge, that’s

And I think the only way to respond to that in terras

of suggesting that teat might not be permissible is that there
you would.have the Stats interrupting a continuous process
which is established»

And then that continuous process moves

from the Master to the judge.
The State, on its own initiative and working against
that continuous process, would be interrupting it and taking
it back and starting over again.

And I can see, even under the

first theory, that argument being mad© to the effect that that
would constitute subjecting him to double jeopardy.
Under the State’s second theory
QUESTION:

It wouldn’t affect your second argument;:

I understand that,
MR» NILSON:

That, I ihink clearly that would

constitute double jeopardy, because fa© would no longer be within

15
the continuous process.

He would have interrupted the continu­

ous process, and the second part of our argument essentially
begins with an assumption that, contrary to the Maryland Court
of Appsals f this Court holds that jeopardy begins to attach
at the hearing before the Master,

And then the State’s

position is that it is a single jeopardy as long as you stay
within that continuous process on through the stag© of th© cas®
where th© judge enters the order.

But that if you interrupt

•that continuum then you would b@ violating double jeopardy
under th© State’s statute.
QUESTIONS
procedure will help.

I have a little . trouble, maybe your
When the juvenile is brought in before

th© juvenile judge, why is he in jeopardy then?
MR, NILSQN: At what stag®, Mr. Justice Marshall?
QUESTIONi

The beginning.

MR. NILS ON. I

Well, h© didn’t —

QUESTION:

Because, as I understand, you said the

judge can try him then and there.
MR. NILSQN:

Right?

Well, typically he would not-be —

QUESTION: Right?
MR. NILSQN:

If he was brought before the judg© for

an adjudicatory hearing directly, yes; but typically that does
not happen.

Typically, the juvenila does not com© into contact

with the judge at a hearing until th© final stag®.

Except in

the casas that X mentioned earlier, which is a waiver hearing,

16

when» the Issue is whether jurisdiction, should be waived,
and the criminal court waives; an aggravated offense; or a
situation where they anticipate in advance that exceptions
would be taken to the finding of the Master.
But otherwise —
QUESTION;

He was just told to appear before the

magistrate.
MR. NILSON:

That is correct.

Generally speaking,

h© never appears before the judge —
QUESTION;

And does fee magistrate ask him if he’s

guilty?
MR. NILSON:
QUESTION;

Pardon me?
Is it the magistrate who asks him, "Did

you do this?"
MR. NILSON; Well, it's the Master who presides over
th© taking of evidence.
QUESTION;

Y©s. That’s who —

MR. NILSON: And that would involve testimony put, on
by th© State’s Attorney and testimony put on by the juvenile,
which might include testimony by the juvenile.
i-«

Thirdly, and this is, I think, the third argument of
th© third argument of th© State really relates to the first
two, is feat even if a system such as feat embodied in
Maryland’s juvenile court statutes and rules would be viewed as
violative of double jeopardy if applied to trials in fee crirain-

17
al courts, special consideration of the need for some informal­
ity, flexibility, and experimentation in the juvenile justice.
setting, should lead to a conclusion that the entertainment
by a judge of exceptions filed by the State, as we have here,
does not violata principias of fundamental fairness and is not
contrary to double-jeopardy prescriptions, in the context,
the special context of juvenile court proceedings.
QUESTION3

In Maryland, did you ever have a — was

there any period when, rather -Khan having Masters take this
first step and make th© preliminary inquiry, this was don© by
interviews at the hands ©f trained social and behavioral
professionals who were not lawyers?
MR. NILSONs That is still done to & considerable
extent. There is a vary elaborate, what w® call an intake
process in Maryland.
QUESTION: Was th©r© a time when it

went directly

from — without the intervention of a Master — from ■ails
professional, no-lawyer however, to the juvenile judge?
With a report.
MR. NILSON:
that happened.

I suspect that there was a time when

Masters haven't been employed for©v©r in

frequently in Maryland, And there am many

cases that; nr© disposed of by these* intake officers who are
not lawyers, not Masters, no judges, before the case ever
gssts up to even the Master stages or the judge stage)»

So

a very large part mtag@ of today’s high volume of juvenile
matters are disposedof through that intake process,
never get before, for

tod, thus,

any kind of adjudicatory hearing, before

a Master or a judge.
The State’s'

first argument on th© qu@sti.on of when

jeopardy attaches“is both set forth in th© first part of our
brief and is reflected, as X indicated before, in th® Maryland
Court; of Appeals decision in Mat-tar of Anderson.

It represents

the approach adopted by several other State courts which have
considered tills issue.
Rather than attempt to fully restat® that portion of
our argument, I would; like to simply focus on th© implications
of this Court's decisions in Breed vs, Jones relative to that
particular argument and this particular case»

Th© holding in Breed was of course limited to the
proposition that once, a juvenile court finds that a juvenile
has committed acts, that violate a

criminal law, the juvenile

has b@© •. put in jeopardy and cannot. thereafter be waived to tli-ss

19

adult: criminal court: system for trial, because such a criminal
trial would constitute a second and impermissible jeopardy.
In its opinion in Breed, this Court made no distinc­
tion between the respective roles of the juvenile court
referee and juvenile court judge in the California proceedings
there at issue, but referred throughout to the actions of -die
juvenile court.
Under the California system, dispositions proposed
by referees do not require the affirmative concurrence of the
juvenile court judge, but become final upon the failure of the
judge to disturb them within 20 days following the hearing
before the referee.
This Court did not considar or discuss in Breed th©
relative roles ©f th© refer©© and th© judge sine© there was no
need for it to do so.
their brief that an

Appellees have correctly pointed out in
examination of th© record in Breed

indicates thit th© adjxidicatory hearing which occurred in that
case was in fact held before a referee, rather than a judge.
And from this they have argued that th© clear implication, if
not the express holding of Bread, is that jeopardy attached in
that case at the moment evidence was first presented to the
California juvenile court referee.
While* this Court could so conclude, if and when
expressly presented with a question, w© submit that th® question
was not presented or decided in Breed.

20
la essence, it: is our position that when jeopardy
attaches in juvenile court proceedings should be answered as
I indicated earlier bi
is first presented

holding that- it attaches wh

*-rclik.avv.

to that officer of the court who has the

authority to decide factual questions and to dispose of the
case by a finding of delinquency or non-delinquency.
Whatever the precis© point in time at which jeopardy
attaches in the California system might he# we submit feat fe©
point in time at which jeopardy attaches in Maryland is when
the recommendations of tha Masfser are presented to and considered
by the juveni1© court judge.
The fact feat fe© Master has previously presided at
an evidentiary hearing and formulated his own proposed findings
should not have to ba held to have accelerated fe© point in
time at which jeopardy attaches.
Surely, fee mere fact feat evidence is presented
before the Master should not result in a holding that jeopardy
attaches when feat occurs» What is critical is the presentation
of evidence to fee trier of fact.
The second part ©f the argument, as I indicated’
before, is premised on an assumption feat fee Court should
hold feat jeopardy did begin to attach at feat first hearing.
And it is our position that the limited review by the juvenile
court judge of fee Master's recommendation upon fee filing of
exception, at that point does not constitute a second and

21
impermissible jeopardy.

When that exception has bean filed,

there has boon at that point in tin® no adjudication of
acquittal or its equivalent, such as would constitute &
termination of the initial jeopardy.

Regardless of the

subjective perception and sens© of relief that the juvenile,
upon hearing a Master's proposed or recommended disposition
of the case in his favor may have, the fact of the matter is

that the Master's recommendation is nothing more than
advisory to the court.

It is not final unless and until

approved by the juvenile court judge.
The correctness of that assertion is not altered in
the least by the fact that Master's recommendations are gener­
ally adopted by the judge in the absence of exceptions by the
parties.
Appellees in their brief have mad© a great deal out
of th@ fact that judges approve tho vast majority of Masters*
recommendations that ar© presented before them, and move from
that to ©argue that judges are a mere rubber stamp.
In th© first place, I think it's terribly important
for this Court to understand s©\?eral thing about the facts
that the &pp©ll@©s have brought to bear in dealing with that.
Mo. 1, they are talking about situations whore no exceptions
are filed to the Master’s recommendations.

Therefor©, it is

natural that th© judge would b© inclined to accept and approve
most of those recommendations

22
Also, in the bulk of those oases, both parties have
even waived the requirement that the Master prepare written
findings, detailed written findings to submit to the judge.
I think it also must b@ barn® in mind that those
figures — that the figures and the information in the record
with respect to the amount of tin® spent by the juvenile court
judg© in reviewing Master's recommendations predate the current
rules.

The testimony of Judge Ks.rwa.cki, which is included

in the Appendix filed in this case, indicates that th© judges
d© do a conscientious job of reviewing those cases that are
presented to the judges with written, recommendations from the
Masters, and do on occasion listen to the recordings which are
now made of the testimony and the proceedings before the
Master.
Maryland Rules provide that prior to the time that
the judg© enters an order, either the State or the juveal1©
may note an exception to the Master's recommendation and have
the matter considered by the judge before final disposition
of the case.
When the juvenile notes an exception, the rule
provides that h© may elect either a hearing d© novo or a
hearing before the judge on th© record established before the
Master.

When the State notes an exception, the controlling

rules now assures the juvenile his right to insist, if h®
wishes, that the judge consider the case solely on th© basis of

23
the record which was ms.de before the Master and which caused
tli© Master to recommend in hia favor.
Alternatively, additional evidence may b© presented
to the judge, but only if he considers it relevant and if
both the State and the juvenile consent to its introduction.
Thus, the juvenile ir_ able to prevent tee state from presenting
cavidenc© which it did not present

before tee Master, or from

re-trying its case again before the judge.
This is not & situation where there are separate
proceedings before different tribunals, each of which, can
result in an adjudication for or against the juvenile.
There is only one proceeding before the juvenile
court, which consiste of fch® presentation of ©vid©nca before
and the issue of recommendations to the court by th© Master,
and the final determination of th© matter on behalf of th©
juvenile court by the judge.

Either filing his consideration

of any exceptions filed, or filing his concurrence in th©
recommendation of the Master in th® absence of exceptions, if
he chooses to concur.
The State’s contention that tee proceedings in
Maryland juveni1© court are continuous in nature and involve
only a single jeopardy does not require this Court to now
adopt the type of continuing jeopardy theory articulated
first by Mr. Justice Holmes in Kepner va United States.
Th© Holmesian continuing jeopardy view clearly involves

v-,■:

...

y

...

..... n?

by adjudications of innocence or guilt: and thereafter proceeds
to a contrary determi. alien or a subsequent trial with the
potential for producing another adjudication.
■ Here

that

process is not no punctuated, because tL-a

Maryland Rules provide that tfca first and only adjudicari os,
cannot and does not occur until after the completion of the,
entire process, when the juvenile -court judge enters an
appropriate order.
When the judge entertains an exception filed by the
State to the Master's recommendation, he does so not in i:im
context of a separate and distinct proceeding, but ns the
final stag©

in n

continuous proceeding.
!

QUESTION: But h© can remand to the Master, I take it?
MR. NILSON:

The only situation under which a remand

to the'Master is provided for is where the judge disagrees
with the Master's recommendation on his own initiative.
Rsm&nd is not provided for in the situation where the matter
goes to the judge on exception.

That particular Maryland rule

only provides for a hearing before the judge.
QUESTION: So when it gets to the judge on exceptions,
the matter is voted up or down right there?
MR. NILSON:

That is what the rule contemplates, pi.

it's voted up or down on the. basis of a non-evidentiary hearing
when the State is the excepting party.

A non- ev3 denti ary

25
unless the juvenile and the State both consent to th© intro­
duction of additional evidence.
QUESTION: Well, if the juvenile does the excepting,
and the judge finds in his favor on his exception, the shew is
over, I take it?
MR. WILSON:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

The show is over then,

There's no sanding back for a new trial?

MR. NILSON: There is no sending back for another
trial before the Master at that point. The State has used up
vhat I would submit is the one card it had available to it in
■he first place, and that is that single continuous proceeding.
To hold that Bread vs. Jones must be extended so as
;o bar the State from completing the process would
'T®

represent,

submit, an unwarranted extension of double-jeopardy

orinciples within the juvenile justice system.
Unless there are further questions at this point,
I'd like to reserve the balance for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Smith?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER S. SMITH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justd.ce, may it please the

Courts
Let me state what I think is the heart of this case.
A child is tried at a trial -- and I'm going to talk

26

about; that in a minuta, because it's a real trial -— ha's
found not guilty.

Witnesses testify? cross-examined? arguments,

motions, legal points, exhibits, the whole bit, all pursuant
to the procedural requirements that have been outlined by this
Court in Gault and Wlnship and, to some extent, in Dreed,
although the first two are obviously the most relevant.
And at the end of it, the Master considers his
decision and he reviews the facts and the law and he says:
"Johnny, I find you not guilty."

And John turns to his mother

and smils and ‘they go out of the courtroom, and everything is
all finished.
QUDSTIONs

Mr* Smith, you say the Master says,

"I find you not guilty"? I got the impression from the State's
counsel that the Master really makes a recommendation to the
juvenile judge.
MR. SMITH:

Well, both of those statements that you

ms.de, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, can b© reconciled, and perhaps
goes to the real heart of the case.
is -that a paper goes

Because the theory of it

to the judge which is a recommendation.

But I —
QUESTION?

Wall, it would be consistent with ■Hie

procedure, though, if the Master didn't say "I find you not
guilty", but said, "Johnny, I'm going to recommend to the judge
to find you not guilty."
MR. SMITH?

Yes, but he doesn't do that

27
QUESTION:

Well, suppose he did,

would you be making

a different argument?
MR. SMITH:
argument here.

No, I would not making a different

Because —

QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Well then, it still isn't very relevant,
Well, because —
Is the case going to turn on whether you

have a loud-mouthed, large-headed Master?
MR. SMITH:

No.

Not all.

QUESTION: Well, you seem to suggest, though, that if
he —
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

No.
— if he presumes to pronounce a judgment,

you're saying that makes him a judge.
MR. SMITH:

No.

No.

QUESTION: Therefore it creates jeopardy.
MR. SMITH:

I do

not think it turns on that at all.

What I think it turns on is what in fact actually
happens.
Nov;, at the conclusion — the record, incidentally,
supports, although I'm not saying that it is by any means
critical to our ultimate position, nonetheless the record
supports the characterization of what the Master says, that
I've just indicated.
QUESTION: Do all seven — are you representing to the

28
Court; that; all seven magistrates at the conclusion of a
hearing, where they're going to recommend, under the procedure,
—- no prosecution, no further proceedings, that they are all
to make the announcement of "You are not guilty"?
MR. SMITHi

Well, one of the Masters, several Masters,

three Masters testified in this, Hr. Chief Justice, and on©
Master, who has evidence —• ws put in th© record a stipulation
of evidence, indicated that h© completely agreed with — he
read the testimony of this first Master and h© said that he
agreed with it, and that in his experience as an Assistant
Public Defender, before he was appointed to Master# he observed
this going on in every single Master's courtroom.
So I think th© answer is that th© record does support
that it happens like that in the courtroom.
QUESTION:

Doesn't ho say "non-delinquent" or

there’s no finding of guilt.
MR. SMITH;
QUESTION;

Have they started that in there?

Well, of course, technically —
You don't find the child guilty or not

guilty?
MR. SMITH;
QUESTION;

Technlcaly you —
You find him delinquent or non-delinquent.

MR. SMITH; Technically in th© statute, of course,
it is delinquent and non-delinquent.

What I’m saying is, and

th© record clearly supports this, that th© Master explains it
in the typical criminal lingo because obviously a child is not

29

going to understand the words delinquent or non-dolinguant,
Now, after the decision — after — without trying
to assume the conclusion — after the Master makes this state­
ment and the child and his parent leaves, the State*s Attorney
decides that he wasn't satisfied with the result.
the child should have been found guilty.
do?

He thought

And so what does he

Hs files an exception and he then goes --- takes that

exception and files it with the clerk, and fchers is then
another hearing before the judge.
Nov?, it used to be that it was de novo, now it's
restricted under the amendment that was made, it was on the
record, and we deal in our brief with the fact we believe that
distinction makes no difference under this Court's decision
in the Jenkins case.

And also, I might say, in the Kepner

case of 1903.
And so what happens?
fact-finder.

There's a new trial, a new

And this time a new fact-finder, whether it’s

with new evidence, which is what the statute provides, or the
sara® evidence, or at least a tape recording of the evidence
before the Master, that judge then decides whether he believes
the child was guilty or not guilty.
QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, what if the foreman of a grand

jury, after a grand jury had deliberated, saw the defendant
standing outside the grand jury room and cam© out and said,
"Congratulations, vre’v© just found you not guilty"?

Do you

30

think that; th© defendant could plead that en bar to an
indictment rendered by another grand jury when he was brought
to trial before a court of competent jurisdiction?
MR. SMITH:

Absolutely not.

And —

QUESTION: Well, doesn't it really maka some difference
here whether the Master's recommendation is something on which
th© Stats could base punishment of th© child, or whether it's
just a recommendation to a judge?
MR. SMITH: Well, but the State does base punishment
of th© child on it? that's th© whole point.
Now, this Court has said —
QUESTION;

Before the judge has signed any piece

of paper?
MR. SMITH; Well, in response to the question you asked
earlier, Mr. Chief Justice, the record indicates that all the
time children “who are before a Master and the Master finds them
guilty and decides that ~~ holds a disposition hearing and
says they ought to go to training school, out the door they go
to that training school that day.

And five days later, or

thereafter, but at least five days later, when the judge
signs that order, that child is very much in the training
school.
And I might say that if he's found not guilty, that
child is very much at home.

So, in that sense, there's real

substantial power that the Master exercises.

31
QUESTIONS Wall, do you suggest: that: th© detention, of
th© child before -the Master's hearing is unconstitutional?
MR. SMITHS

No.

No.

QUESTIONS Then why does it become somehow unconstitu­
tional or illegal afterward, in the interim

between the

Master’s recommendations and the judge’s actions?
MR. SMITH:

I'm not suggesting that it’s unconstitu­

tional afterward.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
happens.

I thought you did.
No. All I'm saying is that that in fact

Because you asked a question of Mr. Nilson earlier,

getting at th© point of what in fact happens to that child
between the time that the Master’s hearing ends and whan th©
recommendation goes to the judge.

All I’m saying is that in

that interim time what happens is that in fact it's implement»©.
If th® Master found the child guilty and says he should go to
a training school, off h® goes.

If the Master says, "No, I

find you not guilty", he goes home.
Nov;, again I don’t suggest that that decides the
ultimate attachment of double-jeopardy question, but certainly
it gives a little background in terms of the reality of it.
QUESTION; Wall, could a juvenile, found to b©
delinquent by a Master, and when the State agents come and say,
All right, now, you’re going off £o th© training school",
rt@!d say, "Wait & minute, I filed exceptions to th® Master’s

32
recommendation."

Now, would he still go to th© training

school?
MR. SMITH:

Assuming that he — the child files ah

exception?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. SMITH:

Yes.

After a finding of delinquency.

If the child in that — well, first of

all h© would have to fil© in that vary courtroom at that
moment.

Nov/, he could.

I mean, his lawyer could hand th®

Master a piece of paper and say —
QUESTION:

And if h© did that, would he still go

off to training school?
MR. SMITH: At that point it would be up to th© State
to decide whether it wished to request detention between the
time that the pipe® of pap®r is filed and when the hearing is
held before the judge.

And if the State wishes to request

detention, then th© Master can give it.
And I might say —
QUESTION:

Well, would he commence serving whatever

confinement in whatever place the. Master had recommended, as
punishment or correction for his delinquency?
MR. SMITH:

Well, h© wouldn’t commence serving in

the sense of th© beginning of a post-conviction sentences.
QUESTION:

He might be detained, just as a person

can be detained after a prosecuting attorney files an
information, unless he makes bail.

33
MRo SMITH:

That's true, although I don't know

that it's an essential difference, Justice Stewart, because
now he —
QUESTION:

Well, I think it does have to do with

whether or not this is a final judgment»

Or equivalent»

MR» SMITH: Well, in Maryland, in most States, a
child is — whether it's detained or committed, it's pursuant
to an indeterminate commitment»
QUESTION:
MR» SMITH:

At least it is in Maryland»

Unh-hunh»
And he goes to the same training

school, and he may be in one cottage if it's detention and
another cottage if it's commitrasnfc»
Now, it seems to me that -QUESTION:

Well, can't h® say, "Look, I'm not

ready to — you have no right to make me begin serving the
recommended period of confinement, because I've taken an
exception to the finding of delinquency»"
MR» SMITH:

Well, he can't say that, for two reasonss

One, because —
QUESTION:
MRo SMITH:

He can take an exception?
He can take an exception, but he can't

say the first, for two reasons:

On©, because there's no such

thing as a recommended period of commitment, because it's
indeterminate»

That's why —

QUESTION:

Well, but that's a recommended period»

34

"You’re committe6 to thn training school until you*5:0 18
years old" , or something like that.
MR. SMITH;

The child can «ay, “If Your Honor

please, wh®» I go to the training school, I want: everybody

:

the training school to know tin.at I’m there in detention rav
than commitment.!i

And certainly the order will say "detention*

rather than “commitment'*'.

To that extent, the child can make

that allegation.
But the child cannot say "I’m sorry, I don’t want to
go anywhere, because you have to wait for the judge to
sentence me."
QUESTION:

Well, take a child who has not been in

detention but has been at home, and a considerable number am
released to the custody of parents, is that not so?
Or to a foster home?
MR. SMITH: That is correct.
QUESTION:

Both pre and —

But if the Master makes his mcommenda-

tions, am you telling us that the child is immediately
pluckad out of his home and taken to a detention center?

Or

can that only be don® as the Attorney General’s Office informed
us, after the judge has signed something?
MR0 SMITH:

He’s plucked out of his home and taken

to tbs detention center, absolutely.
QUESTION:

But teat’s not this case?

MR. SMITH: Well, as a matter of fact

I mean, tbs.-/;®

35
are nisi© plaintiffs in this case, and I'm trying to 'think of
whether — I mean, in each of these cases, of course,they ware
found not guilty, and there wasn't any request by the State to
detain them, pending, as far as I can recall it.

So it's

true that that’s not this case, but what you just said has
happened»
QUESTION:

Your complaint, your grievance is not —

in this case, is not with the

situation where the person is

found to be delinquent by the Master, but rather when he’s
found to b© non-delinquent by the Master?
MR. SMITH:

Exactly.

Now, if I could just get into the lav; a moment.
The fact —
QUESTION: Before you get to that — because I still
am a little puzzled by your answer to Mr. Justice Stewart over
here.

If there is a finding of delinquency, and if the child

files exceptions, is there automatic taking him into custody
or does the State have to request custody?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

If he’s found delinquent, then ■—™
And h© promptly files exception.

MR. SMITH: All right,
Nov;, under the present procedure in Baltimore City,
end it appears a slight doubt, but w© believe that th© rule is
fairly clear, the Statewide rule on this, an exception is not
to be taken if a child is found — if the delinquent act is

36

sustained*

You see, therss’s a bifurcation between the

delinquent act and the penal act, and the delinquent child,
which is:

Does he need car®, treatment and supervision?
And in Maryland you're not allowed, under court rula,

to take an exception until after the dispos.itd.on hearing*
Now, the disposition hearing may take place immediately after
the trial*
QUESTION: Well, if the disposition hearing doss not
take place immediately, ha won’t be taken to a home right away,
will he?
MR* SMITH: All right*

If the disposition hearing

does not take place immediately after the trial, then an
exception could not be filed.
QUESTION: And also h© wouldn't go into a home?
MR* SMITH: Well, what then happens depends on what
the State’s and the Master's desire is.
or th© Master may say

Th© State may say,

and they frequently do —- that

pending disposition hearing, "I wish th© child to b® in
detention", and if the Master so finds, he is in detention*
And th© Mas fear enters an order.
And I would like to point this out —•
QUESTION:

Now, may the prosecutor say precisely the

same thing at th® beginning of the hearing?
MR* SMITH:
QUESTION:

Afe the beginning of th©
Yes

37
MRo SMITH;

— of the disposition, or the trial?

QUESTION;

Well, the beginning of the whole pro­

MR* SMITH;

And when you say "say the same thing",

ceeding.

I'm not .
QUESTION; Can the prosecutor, by the same procedure,
cause the child to b© detained?

During the hearing as well as

immediately after?
MR* SMITH; Well, yes, if you mean that the hearing
goes on for more than a day or a morning*
QUESTION;

Yes*

MRo SMITH; Absolutely*

QUESTION;

So that then, really, what is the . great

— you’re stressing the significance of the Master’s finding
of delinquency.

It doesn’t seem to

me that that is a

significant — that is necessarily controlling in a case where
exceptions are taken.
MR. SMITH:

Well, mv point is this;

The significant

fact, I believe, is that the Master conducts what is conceded
to be under Maryland law and what has been found to be, by two
federal district courts, I might say, a full trial.

Then tin©

child is found guilty or the Master says '’You're guilty5’ or
"not guilty" as tea c&s® may be.
Nov;, the question is this:
questions.

Has he been — two

Has h® been in jeopardy during that period when h©

38

is befora that Master?
QUESTION:

That's —

Well, could frfie Master put him in

could tile Master sentence him?
MR* SMITH: Well, again, we get; involved in •—
QUESTION: Could the Master find him delinquent?
MR. SMITH: Again we get involved in the terminology
problem.
QUESTION:

No, no.

No.

Could the Master sign a

piece of paper saying that "this child is delinquent”?
MR. SMITH:

He does.

H© just doesn't sign the order.

QUESTION;

No, he does not. As I understand, he

recommends that the judge find, him delinquent.
MR. SMITH: Well, the Master, until 19 75, two years
after the —
QUESTION:

Could the Master commit him to training

school until he's cf age?
MR. SMITH: By signing an order?

No.

He may not

sign th© order.
QUESTION;

Mo, that wasn't my question.

Can he do

it?

MR. SMITH s

Yes.

QUESTION;

How?

MR. SMITH;

He does it by stating that he's going

to co it, and it's perfunctory approved by the judge.

Now,

;:.©w that one of the difficulties with this case — let me

39
bo very frank with you, I don’t: want to predict my own doom

her©»
But there have been fifteen judges -that have heard
this case so far.

Five trial judges and ten appellate judges.

And all the appellata judges have ruled against us; and all
the trial judges have ruled in our favor,, including the initial
juvenile court trial judge.
And I think I may have an idea as to why that's
happened.

Because it takes a little bit of time to live

with this case and realize the difference between whatever may
have been -the conceptions at one time or whatever may now be
tli© conceptions ©f & Master in Chancery and a Master in civil
areas versus what is happening in this case.
QUESTION;

Judge Winter is an appellate judge, isn’t

he?
MR. SMITH:

Well, h© sat as — you're right? h© sat

as a trial judge, 'though, in this case.

I was referring to the

judge in his capacity as trial judge at that moment.
Now, when you look at all the facts in this case,
you eventually, I believe, have to com© to the conclusion that
however you dress it up, it boils down to the fact that &
child in a. big urban court system, such as Baltimore, with
on© judge and seven Masters, where th© Masters hear 90 percent
of th© cases, they're tried in front of Masters for the most
part, and they -nr© full and complete trials.

Now, tiler® are only te/o questions that then have to
b© asked. legally, to determine whether or not that offense is

double-jeopardy cl.r=; -s.
The first is —
QUESTION: Suppos® you had three judges for each
Master in Baltimore; would that change the constitutlosial
situation?
MR, SMITH:

Not if there was a full trial in front

©f th® Master, not at all,
QUESTION:
hear it d© novo?

Full trial?

Hot do it on

MR. SMITH:

By that you mean he must

th© record?

I said full trial before the Master.

You know, in my view, if there was a full trial before the.
Master, that doesn't change th® result, that if it then goes
before the judge later on, that it's not double jeopardy.
QUESTION: Suppose th© record showed -Hiat th® judge
spent an «average of three hours on each set of recommendations,
where there war© exceptions?
MR. SMITH: Well, ©f course, if there are exceptions,
Mr. Chief Justice, let's say thera* s an exception by the child.
*

Normally, that's going to be ad© novo hearing.

It can be on

the record, but normally the child will have requested a d® now
hearing.
So -that 'takes it wholly outside the framework of
this c&fea# because it's like th© United States y.„.Ball, ?, child

41
didn't; like what; he got; end he sought: a new ferial.

If it's

the other way around, -then of course we're right back into
our case, if the State takes an exception.
Now, if —
QUESTION:

Well, how much — does your case depend

to any large extant on the perfunctory nature of the judge's
review?

Supposing

following up the Chief Justice's question

—• that each judge spent three hours on each juvenile case that
the State appealed t© him, just in considering it, and at least
as mueh time as the Master had; would your legal position b©
any different?
MR* SMITH:

No*

Now, the record shows that the judge

spends an average of less than on® minute on ©&ch order, and
most ©f whatever is spent in review actually is in connection
with disposition memos, because those &r© the only cases in
which the court gets disposition memos.
But ray answer is no.

New, I think the facts of this

case — in a way, I can get strangled by facts in this case*
If one assumes that my answer to your question were the other
way around, that is, that it really depends on how much time the
master —- the judge spends en the Master's findings.
w© didn't put the facte in the case in the hopes that
I would get strangled with them; w© put the facts in the c&s®
so that this Court would have & good idea of what in fact goes
j

on

©n In the juvenile system of a big city and what in fact

42
this role of the Master is*'so that this Court would realize
that the Master simply is not pom® judge’s employee.
QUESTION: Well, would your case be different if 20
percent of £:© recommendations ware not followed?
MR. SMITH;
question:

MR. SMITH:

No.

It Would not.

Ninety percent?
It wouldn’t make any difference in terms

©f xtfhether the judge can re-try himj if it were 99 percent,
our legal conception would not be any different.

I think that

it certainly makes our case factually much more appealing
that 99.99 percent are perfuctorily signed off.

But, I don't

think, as a matter of theory, it makes any difference.
How, if I could turn for just a moment *—
QUESTION:

Why does it worry anybody?

If it’s

so perfunctory and also 99.9 percent, why does it worry anybody?
Why this 1983 suit?
MR. SMITH;

This 1983 suit.was brought, Your Honor,

because nine juveniles were found not guilty and —
v

QUESTION;

Well, you’re not saying that in cases

where tlie Mas tar finds no delinquency and the Stat» takas
in
exceptions and brings it before the judge that/99-plus percent
of those cases the judge agrees' with the Master's finding of
no delinquency?

You're not tailing us that,-are you?

MR. SMITH; wh&fe, I'm saying is that in 99.9'percent
©f r 1.1 RMdvissrs that are tried in front cf fch® Master, the judge

43
agrees with them.

That’s all I'm saying.

QUESTION:

But your case — your c&s© — my questions

earlier threw us off the track, and I apologize.

Your case

is a case where the juvenile is found non-delinquent by the
Master —
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
takes it to th© judge.

That's correct..
and th© State takes an exception, and
And certainly you're not telling us

that in 99-plus percent of the cases the judge agrees that
there*s no delinquency, are you?
MR. SMITH:

By no roaans,

By no means.

QUESTION: Well, I didn't think, so.
MR. SMITH:

Absolutely.

QUESTION: But that's the only relevant statistic in
your cases which is -- your cas© presupposes a finding of nondelinquency by the Master, and exceptions by th© state.

That’s

your case, isn’t it?
MR. SMITH:

Well, I understand that, but —

QUESTION: And that’s the only issue raised, th© issue
posed by that factual situation.
MR. SMITH:

That's correct.

But I think that th©

facts in the record which indicate the relationship between the
Master and th© judge in terms of th© number of cases the Mastar
hears, and what actually happens to those cases, and the* role
thatthe judge plays, is not wholly irrelevant in terms of

44

basically understanding th© way the system works.

Which is

the only point. I'm trying to make.
QUESTION;

Yes, but your 99 percent figure includes

those in which there’s no exceptions at all by either side.
QUESTION; Right.
MR. SMITH;

That's correct.

QUESTION;

In which it's some 95 percent of th® 99.

QUESTION; Which is most of the cases.
MR. SMITH;

That's correct, sir.

The great bulk of

th© cases.
Now, if I could turn for a moment *—
QUESTION;

Mr. Smith, this Court occasionally

appoints a Special Master, usually it's on a matter of great
moment, and if there are no exceptions filed, would you say
that our rather preemptory adoption of that is rubber-stamping,
and that there's something wrong with it?
MR. SMITH; Well, I ~
QUESTION:

You seem to b© saying that about the

Masters over in Baltimore.
MR. SMITH;

From reading th© opinions of this

Court, my” impression is that th© Court does not in fact
rubber-stamp it. But I think it's a different question, Mr.
Chief Justice, because we are dealing with proceedings that,
under Gault and Winshlp_ and Bread, clearly com© under a number
of procedural protections of th© Bill of Rights. And that's

45
/

why I think w@!re bars»
Now, if I might; for just: a minutae turn tao the law in
our case»

We*re making two points.
•She first is that there is a first jeopardy that

attaches, and that it attaches at the commencement of the
Master*s hearing.
Now, X submit# and It’s elaborated in our brief,
that with the decision of this Court in Jqn©3 v. Breed
explicitly so holds.

Xt was a Master in Jones v. Bread,

jeopardy attached at the start, and it is simply not true, as
the State pointed out# that in California the Master or the
Referee, as they call him there, has the power to sign an
order when a child is committed.

H© does not have to

*

he does not have the power at all*
When a child is taken out of a horn®, that must b©
affirmatively signed by the judge.
Now, therefore, in our view, Jones v. Breed — or
Breed v. Jones squaraly decides the first issue that the State
has raised here.

Remsahar* the State's got two arguments.

Th© first is that jeopardy never attaches at all, and therefor©
there can't be a second one.

QUESTION %

until it g©te to the judge.

QUESTION: Right.

MR. SMITHt

How, I might- say that that represents

~~ what the Stata said in

its argument represents & change

46
from v;hat it says in its brief.

Its brief does not say that

jeopardy attaches when the file from the Master goes to the
judge.

Rather, it says that jeopardy can naver attach until,

on an exception hearing, the judge begins to hear the case
d® novo.
Which either on®, wa suggest, is not proper»
And in our view, Breed v. Jones simply decides that
first question.

Jeopardy does attach at the beginning of the

fact-finder’s hearing. That’s the term -that has always been
used. This Court, in its opinion in Breed v. Jones, talked
in terms of the risk ©f punishment, and surely when that
child ~
QUESTION;

Well, what risk of punishment?

still have not answered my point.

You

Is there any way that the

Master can punish these children?
MR. SMITH; Well, Mr. Justice —
QUESTION;

Any way — I’m listening.

MR» SMITH;

With all respect, th© question can’t

simply b@ answered like that.
QUESTION;

But you just said it, and I want to test

Yes. They're used in all of the major

they are being phased out this July in Prince George’s.
But they tend to b© —
QUESTION:

Where are they used in the count/ where

you have on® Master and one judge?

You would still attack

the system?
MR. SMITH:

That is correct. Although I might say

that, you know, the parties in this case involve plaintiffs
from Baltimore City and the defendent, the State’s Attorney
from Baltimore City.
Nov;, the second half, mid the reason, what admittedly
is not. covered by

in terms by Jones v. Bread, is whether

there is a second jeopardy that, attaches when the case goes befor© the judge.

And we think that there is, for two different

— alternatively for .two reasons.
Either because the hearing before the Master,
despite the fact that he has not signed his name, is sufficiently
final for double-jeopardy purposes, when you consider that it
was a trial, when you consider what double jeopardy is all
about, and when you consider the realities of the system.

50
V

In whicl. c-rc;o, cf courts, it would bo a second jeopardy.
Or if it'js not; final, surely theca's only one
*

alternative, and that is that it's not final; and if it's not.
final, we suggest that it nonetheless is a double jeopardy
because, how does it corae to be a second trial before the
judge?

It comes to ha there because the State prevents the

matter from going to its logical conclusion, which, as we all
know, is going to be the strlka of a pen, and indeed was in
several of tires© cases; the judge mistakenly signed ths order
early, of acquittal,
./

Instead, because the State’s Attorney says no, I
want another crack? that doesn't happen.

And what happens

instead is a new trial before the judge.
QUESTION;

It doesn’t necessarily mean a new trial.

Is it not correct the new trial —
MR. SMITH;

Well, d© novo or new trial.

QUESTION;

But on that point what is the normal —

maybe the briefs tell us but 1 don't remember — what is th©
normal time interval between the Master's — conclusion of
proceedings before the Master and tie entry of the order by th©
judge?
MR. SMITH; At least five) days has to go by, Mr.
Justice Stevens, because -that's 'the time that the party has to
%

decide whether he wants to take an exception. And normally it

would bo ivi-msciiately thereafter, if,

is virtually always

51
the case, written, findings and conclusions are waived. So
normally the answer would be in five days.
QUESTION: Five or six days.
MR. SMITH:

Now, when it goes before the judge at

this second trial, whether it be on the record or d® novo,
in our view that could only be justi.fled by an exception to
the normal double™jeopardy rule.
Nov;, obviously, the Ball exception has no application
here, nor does the Bartkus exception.
about is the Parez-Dinitz exception.

So what we’re talking
Dinitz doesn’t have any

application either really, so it’s the Perez exception.
And our position is that this does not represent
manifest necessity to prevent the trial from going to its
conclusion, because that’s exactly what happened, the State’s
Attorney prevented it.

Why?

Because he didn't like the

result that the Master believed the child was not guilty, and
he wants to go it again before a judge.
And this is —

QUESTION; Well, a necessary part of your argument, as
I now understand it, Mr. Smith, is that in the lion’s share of
cases, after a Master has recommended a finding of nondelinquency the judge does rubber-stamp it.

That, has to ba a

part of your argument* that you’re now making.
MR. SMITH; Well, that. — it is part of our argument.
QUESTIONs

Yes.

MR» SMITH;

seconds, Mr. Chief Justice, to —
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. SMITH:

— to conclude this point.

There must be some

I interrupted, and I'm sorr/.

if jeopardy did attach the

first time, there's got to be some reason for concluding that
there's an excepti.on for saying it didn't attach a second
time. The continuing jeopardy doctrine, of course, has been
rejected by this Court consistently, right up to the present.
And the only way that w© can see that you can say
that a second jeopardy does not attach is to claim that it's
manifest necessity, and yet th© very heart of this Court's
manifest necessity decisions is that for a State's Attorney
to say, "I'm not satisfied with th® result" is not a manifest
necessity.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Nilson?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE A. NILSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. NILSON: Very briefly, if I may us a the few
minutes to clarify several factual points.
In th© colloquy with Mr. Smith, th© question came up
©arly on in his argument about what is said and how it is
said by th© Master at th© conclusion of the case»

I would

53
agree with some of the comments which indicated that that
doesn't have a — or may not have & terribly significant bearing
on the legal outcome, but I think the record clearly establishes
that in many cases the Master specifically advises the juvenile
that the State does have the opportunity to take exception,
erven where the Mas fear doesn't —
QUESTION:

Well, if he says, "I find you not guilty”,

he’s purporting to exercise an authority he doesn't have.
MR. NILSON: Well, he may be overstating it —
QUESTION:

Well, he doesn't have the authority to

find him not guilty.
MR. NILSON;
whatever he says.

He does not have -the sthority? in fact,

But I don't think that this Court should

be laboring under the impression that in all cases he overstates
his authority, because that is not true. The record indicates
that in many instances the juveniles are specifically informed
by the Master 'that the State has the ability to take exceptions
to the Master's proposals, and whan they're not told by the
Master, they are told by their own counsel, because all of the
juveniles at these hearings ara represented by counsel, by and
large by the Public Defender52. Office.
The subject of detention cam® up in the question of
what action th© Master could take with respect to detention
at the time th© adjudicatory hearing was over.

The Mas-her

at that time, as at other times, does have the authority to

54
order interim detention of the juvenile. There is nothing
special about that time, there is no special privilege or
prerogative that the Master has at that 'time to order detention
as opposed to some other time.
QUESTION: Well, then, having found him non-delinquent,
th© Master wouldn’t have occasion to do that, would he?
MR. NILSON; Certainly, having found him non-dalinquent,
he is not going to order him detained.
QUESTION:

That's this case.

MR. NILSON: And that is this case.
Mr. Smith has gone on at great length about the
perfunctory nature of the judge's review of the Master's
recommendations.

Again, as has been pointed out, this case

involves cases which go up on exception.

They are heard, they

are argued, they are considered extensively by th© judges.
They are not perfunctorily reviewed.
The other cases as to which no exceptions are filed,
I would urge this Court to th© extent that it feels that those
—* that how those cases were handled, to look at page 49 of th©
Appendix, which is th© stipulation of Judge Karw&cki.

Not, as

Mr. Smith indicated, one minute per case* but a minimum of
15 to 20 minutes per case, sometimes hours, sometimes listening
to th© recording.
This again in cases where noa© ©f fcha parties are
taking exceptions.

Not this case.

55
Mr0 Smith alse, in talking about part, one of our
argument, on th© question of when jeopardy attached, indicated
that the State has changed its position from what it was in the
brief. And said that in the brief we referred to the time at
which the matter is heard before the Master upon the taking of
exception.
Yes, that is the way we described it in the brief,
because perhaps wa were making a mistake of focusing at ■fehat
point on what this case is all about.

Cases where exceptions

are taken.
There is no difference between the State's position
in the brief and at argument.

It is when the case gets before

th© judge, we say, that jeopardy attaches.
And when an exception is taken, that is when the
excaption, is presented to the judge, and the case is heard.
In the other cases, in til© lion's share of other
cases, it is when the file goes before the judge with the
Master's recommendation.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 3;21 o'clock, p.nu, th© case in th©
above-entitled matter was submitted. 3
