MR, CHIEF JUUTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 76-1151, United States against Ceccolini,
Mr» Allen.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP RICHARD A, ALLEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE PETITIONER
MR. ALLEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case presents two important issues concerning
the scope of the exclusionary rule.
not complicated.

The facts in the case are

BreifXy, Respondent Mr. Ceccolini owned and

operated a flower shop in Tarrytown, New York, where he con­
ducted a gambling business by taking bets on numbers and
sporting events from customers and turning over the proceeds
to a man named Francis MiIlow.

In 1973, the FBI conducted a

'.visual surveillance of Respondent’s flower shop and concluded
that the shop was being used as a drop spot or a pickup spot for
a numbers operation.

In December 1973, however, the FBI sur­

veillance was discontinued.

A year later, in December 197^, a

local policeman, Officer Ronald Biro, took a break from his
school patrol duties and went into the shop for a cigarette
freak and went behind the counter and sat down and struck up a
conversation with Lois Hennessey, a saleswoman who had been
employed in the shop for about a year.

Respondent was not in

the shop at the time. • ' hile Officer Biro was sitting down,

4
making his break and talking to Ms. Hennessey, he noticed on
:op of the cash register an envelope, an unsealed envelope that
had some money sticking out of it.

And, apparently, for no

other reason than curiosity, he looked in the envelope and
saw in the envelope money and what appeared to him to be
gambling slips.

And he closed the envelope and put it back on

nop of the cash register.

Officer Biro did not tell

Ms, Hennessey what he had seen in the envelope and she testi­
fied later that she didn't know what was in the envelope.
He did, however, ask Ms. Hennessey who the envelope was for
and she told him that Respondent had given it to her to give
:o somebody later that day, but she didn't say who and he
didn't ask her,
Officer Biro was unaware at that time that Respondent
had been under investigation for gambling activities.

But the

next day he did tell his fellow officers at the local police
station what he had seen in the shop, and they in turn informed
rne of the FBI agents who had conducted the earlier surveillance!
that Officer Biro had seen some gambling slips in the shop and
shat apparently Ms. Hennessey appeared to know something about
it.

Four months later, in April 1975* the FBI agent inter­

viewed Ms. Hennessey at her home and the record is quite clear
that she freely and willingly undertook to disclose to the FBI
agent her considerable knowledge about Respondent 's gambling
activities

5
QUESTION:

-Coes the record show what led them to

interview her in her home?
MR. ALLEN:

It is not entirely clear, Your Honor,

hut it would appear to be simply the course of the gambling
investigation,
QUESTION:

I thought it was conceded at least for

purposes of this argument that what led the FBI agents to
Interview Ms, Hennessey in her home in the spring of 1975 was
a chain of events that stemmed from the officer finding that
envelope with the money and gambling slips in it during his
cigarette break.

Isn't that conceded arguendo?

MR, ALLEN:

It is conceded in the sense that we would

not contend that he would inevitably have interviewed her but
for that incident,
QUESTION:

In other words, the interrogation by the

FBI agents was a fruit of the unlawful search 1 of the officer
and that the unlawfulness of the search is also a given in this
case; isn’t that right?
MR, ALLEN:

That is right, Your Honor*

It is a fruit

of the search in the sense that it’s reasonable to conclude that
he wouldn st have interviewed her but for the fact that the
search
QUESTION:

And that was conceded and that's not an

Issue in this case, is it?

MR, ALLEN:

It is not an issue except that it is also

reasonable to conclude that he may have interviewed her later,
and that that reasonable »- that conclusion seems to us to
indicate that
QUibTION:
MR, ALLEN:
QUESTION:

Even if the search had not taken place,
That's right»

He might have,

Well, that is one of your arguments,

isn't it?
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:

Pardon me?
That he would have gotten around to her

anyway.
MR,» ALLEN:

Well, we are not contending that he

inevitably would have, but that he might have.

It is not

unreasonable to conclude that.
QUESTION:
MR, A LLEN:
QUESTION:

She was one of his employees.
Tha t is c orrecfe.
She was right in the store and there is

;he possibility that somebody might have asked her some
questions.
MR. ALLEN:

A very good possibility, Your Honor,

but we can't prove it with certainty because we don't know what
would have happened if some different chain of events had taken
jlace.
QUESTION:

And by the time of the interview, at least

by the time of the grand jury appearance, she was a former
employee, wasn't she?

7
MRo ALLEN:
QUESTION:

That Ss right.

That is correct.

hid the FBI interview any other employees

or any other former employees?
MR„ ALLEN:

After Respondent was indicted, but not

before,
In May of 197^> a month later, Respondent was sub­
poenaed to appear before a grand jury and he unequivocally
denied, under oath, that he had ever taken gambling bets from
his customers, either for himself or for Mr. Millow or that he
ever had discussed gambling operations with Mr. Millow.
Respondent was then indicted for perjury before the grand jury
and he waived his right to a jury trial and he 'was tried before
Judge Gagliardi.
The Government‘s principal evidence in his perjury
trial was the testimony of Lois Hennessey who testified in
some detail about Respondent's gambling activities over the
year of her employment with Mr. Millow.

At the end of the

trial, Judge Gagliardi entered a finding of guilt on one count
of the perjury indictment against Mr, Coccolini.

Judge Gagliard

then considered the Respondent's motion to suppress the testi­
mony of Ms. Hennessey that Respondent had made at the outset of
the trial but that the Judge, with Respondent's consent, had
deferred pending the trial.

The Judge then granted Respondent's

suppression motion on the grounds that the testimony of
Ms, Hennessey was the tainted fruit of Officer Biro's search.

8
And he then set aside his. finding of guilt on the ground that
without her testimony there was insufficient evidence to con­
vict Respondent of perjury.
Although the court granted the Government's petition,
waiving two exclusionary rule issues, the Respondent's principal
argument is that the Government's appeal in this ca.se was barred
lay the rouble Jeopardy Clause.
We believe that that argument, that Respondent's
double jeopardy argument is clearly foreclosed by the decisions
of this Court in United States v. WilsonjCUnlfcosi States-.vc
JenkInc and United states v, Martin Linen which hold that the
double Jeopardy Clause is not implicated unless there is a
possibility of a retrial on the general issue of guilt or
innosenee, and that possibility does not exist in this case.
If the Government prevails, Judge Gag Hard i {e finding of guilt
nay simply be reinstated.
QUESTION:

Mr. Allen, would the double jeopardy

argument be the same if there were a possibility of a reversal
for further findings, for example, to determine whether the
trial judge had relied at all on the testimony about the illegal
search itself, or something like that?

Would the double

Jeopardy Clause present a problem then?
MR. ALInN:

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

The

trial judge in this ease ruled that without the tainted
evidence there was insufficient evidence of guilt.

If --

s
QUESTION:

What I am suggesting is:

Supposing we

agreed with him as to some of the evidence being tainted but
not all that he excluded,
I can't give you -- For example, maybe the portions
of her testimony that did not relate to the illegal search,
itself.

Perhaps that should be received but testimony per­

taining to the illegal search should have been excluded.
he relied on that, just to give an example.

Maybe

Would you then have

a double jeopardy problem?
MR« ALLEN:
I would not think so,

It is difficult to visualize. Your Honor,
1 would think that if the court con­

cluded that some of her testimony was admissible but some was
rot, I should think it would be open to the district court
simply — the directions to the district court simply to
consider whether the admissible portion of her testimony, as
well as the other testimony in the case, was sufficient to
support a finding of guilt,
QUESTION:

Would it be permissible, in your view,

for them to make additional findings,as long as there were no
more evidence to be heard?
' MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:

That is correct,
He has already won that once with respect

to the exclusion of the evidence we have been talking about,
hasn't he?

Having made a decision, in general, then he re­

examined it in light of the exclusion of part of the evidence,

10

he came to a different conclusion.
MR„ ALIEN:

That’s right.

He concluded that the

evidence, without her testimony, was insufficient.
QUESTION:

So that if the course that Justice

Stevens was hypothesizing were followed for some reason, he
would raerely repeat that exercise, applying it to a different
set of facts.
MRo ALLEN:

That is right.

ci question of law for him.

It would be essentially

Though it is difficult for me to

visualize what portion of her evidence might be admissible if
some of it was not admissible, in any event.
QUESTION:
do?

no what did the trial judge, precisely,

During the course of the trial, he apparently came to the

conclusion that the evidence was inadmissible, but nonetheless
the trial proceeded.

And at the end he said, !'I find you guilty

on the basis of all the evidence,” then he immediately there­
after, said„ "Some of the evidence should be excluded, and on the
basis of the admissible evidence there is not evidence to prove
you guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and, therefore I
chat?

Do

And what did he do?
QUESTION:

He set aside the finding of guilt.

But

1 think your recitation is somewhat inaccurate, Mr. Justice
ttewart.

VJhat he did was at the beginning of the trial -- at

the end. he indicated that at the beginning of the trial he had
concluded that the search was unlawful.

11
QUESTION:
MR. ALLEN;

Right.
And that, therefore, the tangible evidence.'

of the search, that is, the envelope and what it contained,
would not be considered by him.

Eut he made no ruling until

after his finding with respect to whether Ms. Hennessey's
testimony should be suppressed as the fruit.
QUESTION:
you mean.

After his ruling -» Nov; which ruling do

Finding of guilt,
MR, ALLEN:
QUILT ION:

After his finding of guilt.
But then he said, "However, Ms. Hennessey's"

•— immediately thereafter or very soon thereafter ~~ "However,
I find that Ms. Hennessey's testimony was inadmissible and on
the basis alone of the admissible evidence I find there is
Insufficient evidence to sustain a verdict of guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt and, I therefore"
MR. ALLEN:

What?

"I, therefore, set aside the finding of

guilt."
QUESTION:
MR, ALLEN:

He didn't enter a motion of acquittal „
He did not enter a formal motion of

— judgment of acquittal.

And, therefore, it would be In­

accurate if Respondent tries to characterize it as a grant of
c. motion for judgment of acquittal.

It seems to us that it is

more equivalent to the procedure that was engaged in in
United ttates y. Morrison, where the trial judge, after making
a finding of guilt, then considered a suppression motion, granted

12

the suppression motion and said,

"I am going to take appropriate

action, depending on what the appellate courts do with my
motion."

The Supreme Court concluded that his granted sup­

pression motion was error and he simply then reinstated his
binding of guilt,
acquittal.

In that case, it was not the judgment of

It seems to me that this case is somewhat analogous

to tha t.

Appendix?

There is no order.

It was

Does what he

said appear in the Appendix?
MR, ALLEN:

What he said appears in the Appendix

to the petition.
QUESTION:

Would it be fair to say that the judge

was just doing his thinking out loud, his reasoning processes?
MR. ALLEN:

That would be fair to say. Your Honor.,

QUESTION: "With this evidence, I would find him
guilty."

"Without this evidence, I cannot find him guilty.‘
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor,
But he did find him guilty at first,

MR, ALLEN:

That is correct.
He didn't say, "I would," he did find

him guilty, didn't he?
MR c A LIEN:

QUESTION:
MR. ALLSN:

lid he release the man?
He did release the man.

On page 32A of the Appendix to our Petitions the
judge says, "Although the corroborating evidence
the wiretapped conversation

particularly

is strong when coupled with

Lois.Hennessey's testimony, standing by itself It is Insufficient
to prove Ceecolini 8s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt."

And

he goes on to say, "The foregoing constitute the Courtfs findings
of fact and conclusions of law,

Now, Mr. Ceecolini was re-

leased cn his own recognisance."
QUESTION;

But this is wiretap.

'Was Ms. Hennessey

involved in this wiretap business?
MR. ALLEN:

No, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Well, this is something different, isn't

MR. ALLEN:

The wiretap, I believe, refers to a --

it?

QUESTION:

He says, "Particularly the wiretapped

conversation."
MR. ALLEN:

I believe that the wiretapped conversation

refers to a conversation — I may be wrong in this, Your Honor,
but I believe it refers to a conversation between Mr. Ceecolini
and Mr. Mil low, in which Mr. Mi How told Mr.Ceecolini that when
lie goes before the grand jury just say he doesn't remember
anything.

I may be incorrect on that though, Your Honor.
There was additional wiretap evidence in the case

14

which had nothing to do with Ms. Hennessey.
QUESTION:
MR* ALLEN:
QUESTION:

You say there Is no order in this case?
No, Your Honor, no formal written orders.
Why did the Appellate -- Court of

Appeals have jurisdiction when there was no order by the
district Court?
MR» ALLEN:

There was a ruling by the District Court,

a grant of a suppression motion that appears orally ~~
QUESTION:

No order, no judgment.

Courts of Appeals

have jurisdiction to review judgments, orders, not just con­
versation by a district court.
QUESTION:

Dismissal of indictment for there to be

a proper appeal*
MR.» ALLEN:
QUESTION:

Pardon me?
It's an order of dismissal of an indictment

:o be at the point, for there to be an appeal,* isn't that, right?
QUESTION:

But there isn't any.

MR» ALLEN: Well, there is no formal piece of paper
on which he enters a formal grant of a suppression motion or a
motion for a judgment -QUESTION:

You've told the Chief Justice that all

the judge was doing was, quote, "talking out loud,"

Is that

what you said?
MR* ALLEN:

Well, he reasoned out loud.

QUESTION;
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:

Is that a judgment, thinking out loud?
He made a ruling on the record,
Where Is the ruling? That's what ray

brother, Stewart, is trying to find out.
MR, ALLEN:

Apparently, Your Honor, there is no

piece of paper.
QUESTION:

Well, look at page 10 of the Appendix *»-

not the gray one the brown one ~~ which seems to me to be the
closest thing;.

It looks like a minute order.

"February 10,

'■976 -- Court finds the defendant Guilty on count 1 and not
guilty on count 2,
Bail exonerated.

The guilty verdict on count 1 is set aside.
Gagliardi, J."

MR0 ALLEN:

Thank you, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

I

think that is the piece of paper that the Government appeals.
I apologize,
QUESTION:

That's the piece of paper that implements

his statement, I take it, on page 32A, "X find insufficient
evidence to say beyond a reasonable doubt that Ceccollni was
guilty of count l."

That is correct,
The first is his finding and on page 10

is something like a judgment, if not a judgment.

But there is no judgment in the Court

of Appeals in that jurisdiction or a ruling in that juriedictior
MR, ALLEN:

Frankly, Your Honor, I have to confess

ignorance that I don't know whether an appealable judgment
requires a piece of paper.

In an ordinary criminal case, the

judgment is not entered until —
QUESTION;

I have not onoe said "a piece of paper,”

I said a final judgment.

I am still looking for the final

judgment.
MR, ALLEN: There was a final judgment -~
QUESTION:

Was there any case that you have had that

said a minute entry is a final judgment?
MR. ALLEN:

Well, I may not be understanding. Your

Honor, and I apologise, but there was clearly a final judgment
on Respondent*s suppression motion, granting that motion, and
the consequence of that was setting aside the finding of guilt.
Mow, it is my understanding that is an appealable
ruling,
QUESTION:

If the Court of Appeals thought so, did

they make any reference to it?
Mo

ALLEN:

No, Your Honor, I don't believe they did.

They had no question that what the District Court did
was properly appealable.

17

QUESTION:
MR» ALLEN:

Or at least seemed to take it for granted.
That is correct* Your Honor»

Unless the Court has any further questions on this
matter to which 1 am afraid I cannot elucidate any further —
QUESTION:

Just one factual question, Mr» Allen.

Is it correct that Ms. Hennessey,fs testimony included
testimony describing what the court assumed to be an illegal
search, Itself?

The testimony on the merits, that is.

MR. ALLEN:

That is correct.

It included testimony,

X believe, about the events on December 18th, that is that
vhere was an envelope that Mr. Ceecolini left for- her to give
to Mr, Mil low, but it wasn't on the merits in:, the sense that
she testified she didn't know what was in the envelope.

So, it

wasn't direct evidence of Respondent’s gambling activities,
perhaps inferential evidence.
QUESTION:

The thrust of her testimony —

How was it relevant, then?

I mean what

was the relevance of that evidence on the merits?
MR. ALLEN:

It may not have been relevant.

Arguably,

Lt was relevant as creating an inference that it was simply an
additional instance of Respondent's activities with Mr. Mill own
The thrust of her testimony was about other events and otheractivities by Respondent.
QUESTION:

Her testimony did include the particular

Biro, of course, did not testify on the merits.
MR» ALLEN:

No, Your Honor,

18

QUESTION:
subject

I note at page 2lAbefore we leave this

21A of the Appendi;: to your Petition for Cert, Unite;

States Court of Appeals has said, "decreed that the judgment of

t
said District Court be and it hereby is affirmed."

So the

Second Circuit has said there is a judgment in this case.
MR. ALLEN:

Apparently so, Your Honor.

What, precisely,

the judgment that they had in mind, I have to confess I don't
know, because the judge never did enter a formal —■
QUESTION:

Mr. Allen, do you attach any significance

to counsel’s statement in his colloquoy with the trial judge
at page 36A, in which he argued that what the judge had done,
quote, "would provide my client with an acquittal on the
merits, which would not be appealable, which would be, as a
natter of double jeopardy law, final"?
MR. ALLEN:
Honor?

Do I attach significance to it. Your

I understand there is argument, but I think it lacks

merit, because it is quite clear and the judge deliberately
Indicated that the procedure he followed was to enter first a
finding of guilt and then to set that aside.

Even if what he

did, setting aside of the finding of guilt, could be deemed to
be an acquittal ~~ which I dc not believe it is fair to
characterize it -« even if that were true, the Double Jeopardy
Clause would not preclude the Government’s appeal.
QUESTION:
MR. ALLEN:

Why?
Because United States v. Martin Linen

19

and those cases have made quite clear that the double Jeopardy
Clause isn't even implicated unless there is a possibility of a
retrial.

And, I think, in United states v, Jenkins, the Court

quite expressly said that when there is a verdict of guilt and
after that there is a judgment of acquittal, the Government iaj,
appeal,
QUESTION:

The other side, I suppose, Mr, Allen, is

>he Criminal Appeals Act provides if your appeal Is from the
order suppressing evidence, that has to be before trial, if
".hat were the basis of appeal,
MR, ALLEN:

I don't believe so, Your Honor,

In

United States v„ Morrison, there was a motion — granting of
a suppression motion afterwards.
QUESTION:

Yes, but the statute says "an appeal by

the United States shall lie to a Court of Appeals from a
decision or order with the district Court excluding or
suppressing evidence, not made after the defendant has been
put in jeopardy,"
It isn’t on that theory.
from a dismissal of an indictment.

Your theory is an appeal
That's the statutory basis

for the appeal,
MR, ALLEN:

That is correct. Your Honor, although

whether It may be deemed formally a dismissal of the indictment
or not, I think the Court has made clear that the Criminal
Appeals Act was designed to give the Government a right to

20

appeal In every case where the Double Jeopardy Clause is not
■permitted, regardless of the formalism of the judgments.
QUESTION:

The Criminal Appeals Act doesn't-go to

that because there is just an ordinary general rule, quite
apart from, the Criminal Appeals Act, that the Court of Appeals
has the jurisdiction to review a judgment or an order, a final
order, decision, something that's entered and that's identi­
fiable, and that's the problem here.

But I think we have prettj

well exhausted the subject.
MR. ALLEN:

Thank you, Your Honor.

The first issue that our petition raises is whether
the exclusionary rule requires a suppression of evidence in
connection with crimes committed after the evidence is obtained,
That issue is simply Illustrated fcy the facts of this case.
Officer Biro's excessive curiosity disclosed information about
gambling activities incriminating to Mr, Ceccolini.
formation was of two types.

That in­

First, it was tangible evidence of

gambling activities and, second, it was information that
Ms. Hennessey appeared to know something about it.

Now, there

i'-S no question in this case that the information, at least the
tangible evidence that Officer Biro discovered, could not be
admitted In any prosecution cf Respondent for crimes committed
before that search took place, either gambling offenses or
other crimes.

The only question in this case is whether the

exclusionary rule requires the information that he discovered

21

to be suppressed In the prosecution of perjury that took place
J

five months after his search took place.
very simply, is that it does not.

And our position,,

The purpose of the exclu­

sionary rule is to deter police misconduct by taking away
their incentives.

It is very difficult to see how a policeman

would have much incentive to search for evidence of a crime
that hasn't yet taken place and may never take place.

And even

if a policeman did have much incentive :Ln that respect, it is
doubtful that the exclusionary rule would provide much sig­
nificant deterrence. If a policeman is not going to be deterred
from conducting an unlawful search by the prospect of jeopar­
dizing the prosecution of a crime that has already been com­
mitted, it seems very unlikely that the prospect of supressing
evidence of a future crime would make him behave any differently.
And, in any event, it is clear from the facts of this case, we
submit, that Officer Biro was not at all motivated by a desire
to find evidence of a crime that had not yet taken place, or
evidence of Respondent's perjury five months later.

Officer

Biro testified and there is no dispute that he was not even
aware.-at that time that Respondent was engaged in any gambling
activities.
We think the Court of Appeals erred in applying the
exclusionary rule to a subsequently committed crime.
doesn't appear to have risen very frequently.

The issue

We are aware of

only three other cases,discussed in our brief, in which the

22

issue has arisen and in which in all of those decisions the
courts held that the evidence was admissible.
The issue that arises far more frequently is the
second issue presented in this case which is whether the trial
testimony of Lois Hennessey should be considered to be the
tainted fruit of Officer Biro's search.

This Court has expressly

reserved the live witness testimony question in previous deci­
sions , and. there has been considerable difference of opinion
among the courts of appeals cn the matter.

That Issue is

separate and independent from the first subsequent crime issue,
And if cur position is sustained it would warrant reversal of
this case, whatever the court decided on the subsequent crime
issue.
In this case, it appears that as a result of the
search cf the envelope Officer Biro learned that Hennessey
night know something about Respondent's gambling activities.
He didn't find that out for certain and he didn't xnow what,
if anything she would know, if she knew about it.

But a follow­

up interview, four months later, disclosed that she had con­
siderable knowledge about the matter and was perfectly willing
to cooperate and to testify about it.

The question, very simply,

is whether her testimony at trial about those matters is ex­
cludable as the fruit of Officer Biro's search.
Ever since Nardone v« Un 11ed htates., it has been
accepted that at some point along the causal chain of evidence

23

originating from some i3.lsga3.ity, the connection between the
evidence developed and the original illegality becomes so
attenuated as to dissipate the original taint.

The attenuation

doctrine is simply an application of the basis theory of the
exclusionary rule.

At some point, an item of evidence derived

only remotely from the original Illegality, the exclusion of
that evidence is not going fcc- significantly deter a policeman,
Bo the question in each case is where in that causal chain the
attenuation point occurs.
Mr, Justice Frankfurter in Wardone suggested that that
question be left to the good sense of judges, but In close
cases judges of equally good sense frequently disagree,

bo

this Court has established a number of guidelines to guide
3.?ederal judges in that determination.
With respect to the question of verbal statements
made after an arrest, for example, this Court in Wong Sun v.
United States and [gown v. Illinois defined the inquiry as
whether the statement is sufficiently a product of free will
as to break the causal chain between that statement and the
original illegality, and has defined as relevant to that
inquiry a number of factors, including the temporal proximity
between the arrest and the illegality, the presence of inter­
vening circumstances, the degree to which the police exploited
the original illegality, and, finally, the flagrancy of that
illegality.

24

The trouble is that those considerations just don't
apply very well in the case :Ln considering whether the testi­
mony of a witness should be deemed to be the fruit of an
original illegality, or, if they did apply, they would lead to
the conclusion in almost every case, we submit, that the testi­
mony ought to be admitted.
Whether the testimony of a witness like Lois Hennessey
is more proxlmately the result of Officer Biro's search or is
more proximately the result of intervening acts of free will
by herself or by the FBI agent who decided to interview her or
bj7- the prosecutor who decided to subpoena her, those are
basically philosophical questions that are unresolvable and
that have very little to do with the purpose of the exclusionary
rule.

They don't have much to do with the purpose of the ex­

clusionary rule because essentially they focus on the witness'
state of mind and the circumstances occurring after the police
search took place, the police misconduct took place, rather
than on those things that might have motivated the police to
engage in that kind of conduct in the first place.
Furthermore, in almost every case, the decision of a
witness to testify is based on a very large complex of motiva­
tions and circumstances.

An analysis that requires a court to

try to figure out the role that free will plays in that decision
permits courts to come to almost any conclusion that they desire
in any given case, as we think the opinions in the Court of

25

Appeals in this area indicate.
For those reasons, we think the live witness question
ought to be decided as a policy matter, a policy matter that
looks to the purposes of the exclusionary rule, and, very
simply, a question which inquires whether the exclusion of a
witness' trial testimony is likely to provide enough additional
deterrence of police misconduct to outweigh the social costs
of exclusion.

Noiv, while there is not much empirical data on

the matter, as there rarely is in exclusionary rule cases, we
think it is reasonable to conclude that the police have signifi­
cantly less incentive to engage in unconstitutional conduct to
discover the name of a possibly potential witness than to obtair.
tangible evidence or verbal fruits.

Would you be making the same argument if

Ms. Hennessey had told the officers about some tangible evidence;
some other evidence that they went ahead and found and then
introduced but never offered her testimony?

No, Your Honor, we wouldn't.
You wouldn't?

Why?

MR. ALLEN:

Because what we are focusing on is --

The real question is whether they are permitted to

use in any way the identity, the witness whose identity they
have known from their illegal search.
MS« ALleN:

That is correct. but the attenuation

26

question is whether the evidence that we seek to introduce is
sufficiently attenuated from the primary illegality.
QUESTION:

Well, it's just as attenuated if instead

3f Ms. Hennessey testifying she voluntarily tells them about
some physical evidence.
MR. ALLEN:

No. there are many intervening circum­

stances that make a difference between her ultimate testimony
at trial and whatever she may say to a policeman who comes to
talk to her.
QUESTION:

Would there not be a difference between

the evidence that Mr, Justice White is speaking of if he had
been charged with a substantive offense of gambling, and the
evidence that she had pointed to, if I understand his hypo­
thetical, was a lot of numbers slips.

Here, you've made the

point that the crime was a crime committed five months later.,
namely the crime of comm being perjury before a grand jury —
MR, ALLEN:

Well, that's correct»

QUESTION: — and to which no tangible evidence has aiq
relationship,
MR. ALLEN:

Well,, the tangible evidence could be

used In proving that crime.

If the gambling slips themselves

were admissible, it would be relevant to proving that crime.
My point is that,apart from the question of whether
the exclusionary rule ought to apply to subsequent crimes, it
should not apply to exclude the testimony of a witness.

And we

2?

think the testimony of a witness differs for attenuation
purposes significantly from either physical evidence or the
example that Mr. Justice White posed,which is the statement of
either the defendant or a witness made in the course of a
police investigation. •And.the'differences•between — The state­
ment problem is a difficult problem and it may be that state­
ments made by a witness that lead to further things that lead to
further things., that those ultimate things would be attenuated
under traditional attenuation analysis .

But we think that there:

Is a difference in kind between trial testimony and other kinds
of ev id enc e.

Including statements during interrogation.
Including statements during interrogation.
Mr, Allen, on this argument, your argument

would be the same if he had been indicted for the substantive
offense of gambling and not perjury, wouldn't it?
MR, ALLEN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
But the record doesn't tell us whether he

was indicted for gambling, does it?
MR. ALLEN:

I don't believe he was,

In fact, I am

fairly certain that he was not.
In summary, we contend that there are two separate
and independent grounds warranting a reversal of the judgment
below and a reinstatement of the Listrict Court's finding of
guilt.

28

First, we think the courts erred in applying the
exclusionary rule to a crime committed five months after the
search took place»

Second, we believe that they erred in sup­

pressing; the trial testimony of a witness as the fruit of an
illegal search.
Pd like to reserve whatever time remaining I have,
Your Honor.
QUEibTIONd :

Those are two quite independent and

almost unrelated arguments, aren't they?
MR. ALLEN:

That is correct, Your Honor.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEON J. GREENSPAN, ESQ.,
FOR the RESPONDENT
MR. GREENSPAN:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
We have before this Court probably one of the most
perplexing and intriguing questions that it has been my
privilege to ever come across.

Unfortunately, like many simple

things, they are very complex and like many complex things they
are very simple.

To me, it is simply illogical to differentiate

between the fruit of the poison tree as being live witness tes­
timony or being physical evidence or being documentary evidence.
To me, the analysis is whether or not there was an intervening,
superseding cause.

If there was an intervening, superseding;

cause of some licit nature, then there is attenuation, then tne

29

evidence, whether it be live witness testimony or whether it
be documents or physical evidence they would, thus, be usee].
QUESTION: 'lio you. think there is any difference when
with respect to the live witness, the live witness may not
give any testimony at all even after taking the stand and
taking' the oath,
MR, ALL&N:

No, Your Honor, it seems to me that every

witness has an obligation to testify and the court is open to
every ran and every woman's testimony,
QUESTION:

barrier, namely, the Fifth Amendment.

But 1 think the only differentiation that

can be made is the one that has been made by this Court —
QUESTION:

or not the evidence cou'Jd or should be used against the witness,

My position, and X think the position this Court has
taken and if it hasn't taken it should take, is simply that you
can't have any type of an attenuation of a live witness test uaor.y

Mr. Greenspan, are you in any position to

MR. Gf&jSNSPAN:

Yes, Mr. Justice, I believe I am able

to raise it because I believe, as I've argued in our brief that
the Government, under any event, should be estopped from even
exercising this right r appeal because its owr inequitable

You conceivably can raise a jurisdictional point at

in the Court of Appeals on some other ground without crosspetitionlng- But here if you were to prevail, the Court of
Appeals, instead of affirming the judgment of the District Court,
would have dismissed the appeal, which is not the same'result.
MR. GRBENSPAN:

I would agree, Your Honor.

That describes that second category he

referred to.
MR. GREENS PAN:

What I would like this Court to

consider is the interesting problem, that arises and I suppose
it comes into a crossroads between the double jeopardy pro&>-

visions* the statutory provisions for how a suppression motion
should be handled and other constitutional questions.

The

simple answer to it is that this Court should take the position
that Judge Gagliardi was under an obligation to decide the
notion for suppression before he decided the guilt or innocence
of the defendant.

The practice requires it. Rule 12 require?* in,

34
and only for good cause shown should he have permitted this
question of the illegality of the search and seizure to come
before him along with the trial.
QUESTION:

He should have decided it during the trial

or before the trial?
MR. GREENSPAN:
before the trial.

I eay first he should have decided it

If he did not do it before the trial,

despite being urged to

go

so,

he was obligated to find it

before he made a finding of guilty.
QUESTION:

Why would any judge, having read Jenkins

and Wilson, decide that suppression motion during the trial
which cuts off the Government's right to appeal?

I would think

he would decide either before the trial or after the trial,
since the Government has a right to appeal in those cases
and you would have a right to see whether the District Court
i/as right on its decision,
MR. GREENSPAN:

I don't find anything holy in the

technical right of the Government to appeal, where the
Government, itself, delays unduly

giving the information

bo the defendant so he can comply with Rule 12, so he can mare,
in the normal course of things, a suppression motion.

I think

that if the Government does this, -goes through this delay in
order to give itself the technical right of appeal, and I think,
that if a District Court judge- goes along with this, then you
have inequitable conduct which should, in ray judgment, estop

35
she Federal Government from exercising its technical right of
appeal„
But, what's even more important is that there was a
motion-made to dismiss at the close of the prosecution's case.
At that point, Judge Gagliardi, in my judgment, was under an
obligation to determine what evidence licitly was before him.
If he was going to determine then that the only licit evidence
before him. was insufficient to convict the defendant, then he
should have, at that time, entered a judgment of acquittal.
At that time jeopardy would have attached; at that time the
Government would have had no right of appeal.

By merely

through a nicety or a technicality reserving this right,
reserving it until after he has heard all of the evidence,
reserving it until he has waived illegal evidence in d©terrainf

simply because -~

This was a. court trial without a jury.

MR. GREENSFAN:
QUESTION:

That has no significance to you at all?

MR. GRRENSPAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, but that was unfortunately —

Mo, sir, because Judge Gagliardi

You don't expect me to take the same

position you do on that, do you?
MR. GREENSPAN:
QUESTION;

Excuse me1 no. Your Honor.

I recognize the difference between a judge

trial and a jury trial.

36
MR* GRRENSPAN:
QUESTION:

But, Judge Gagliardi —

Permit me, if I may.

MR» GREENSPAN:

I am sorry.

Excuse me, Your Honor.

If Your Honor please, I would say this.

Judge

Gagliardi said he would have permitted the same illegal
testimony to go to the jury, and then if the jury had con­
victed be then would have set it aside, simply because he
wanted to create or to preserve a right of appeal in the
Government, a right of appeal that the Government could have
and should have exercised pre-trial, if it had done the right
thing, the equitable thing, the fair thing.

And that is to

inform this defendant that there was a possibility of an
illegal search and seizure so he could raise if before trial;,
so that the court could determine it before trial, so that
•;he defendant would not be put in the position where he had
vo waive the jury trial because of the specter of having a
'.lot of prejudicial evidence come before a jury before he
would have had an opportunity "to examine into the witnesses,
before he would have had an opportunity to determine just how
and in what manner he should properly defend this client.
Now, 1 don't believe that the Government should take
advantage of its own wrongdoing.,.

This Court has many times

caid that a wrongdoer should not profit by his wrongdoing.
’ll this case, it is the Government who is the wrongdoer,

In

;hls case, it is the Government that seeks to profit by its

37
'.wrongdoing and it will if this Court will permit it.
Novi, I'd like to ask this Court to consider another
issue here, and that is the question of the other side of an
attenuation.

In other words, should an individual who finds

himself in the position of knowing that the Government has
illegally obtained evidence, Should he be, with impunity, able
to fly in the face of that evidence and commit subsequent
crimes.

X believe not and I don't intend to argue that point.

YJhat I would argue is simply this — and I think all of the
oases that have been considered have held this — that where
a. defendant has no knowledge of the illegality and then he goes
before a grand jury, and then the prosecutor doesn't tell him
that he is a target, and then the prosecutor doesn't tell him
that he has any kind of illegal evidence, then the defendant
is not placed in the same position as an individual who is
aware of the fact that there was an illegal search and .seizure,
Then, despite that, such as in the income tax cases,files a
fraudulent return, or in the other fraud cases, commits a
fraudulent act, relying, of course erroneously, on the fact
that the Government can't use that testimony or that illegal
evidence in order to convict him.
Here, you had a man who was ingenuously advised by
the United States Attorney, against all the rules of the Second
Circuit, that he was not a target when in fact he was.

He was

never told that they had seen Ms. Hennessey and had this illegal

33
evidence when, in fact, they had that illegal evidence.
QUESTION:

Of course, he could have solved all of it

by sealing up the envelope.
MR. GREENSPAN:

Yes, You** Honor, they could have

solved all of it by sealing up the evidence -QUESTION:

I mean he could have, your client.

MR, GREENSPAN;

Your Honor, he could have solved it

by not being involved in anything,
QUESTION:

That's right,

MR, GREENSPAN:
QUESTION:

But the fact is he was,

Or by telling the truth,

MR. GREENS PAN:

Or by telling the truth.

But the fac

is that he didn't tel'l the truth because the question is?
what did he know or what didn't he know as to what the truth
was or what the evidence was?
I am not trying to justify or excuse perjury.

What

3 am saying is that there is a certain amount of due process,
fair play and equity in our court procedures.

And if the

United States Attorney, who is not only the prosecutor but the
protector Of the innocent, doesn't follow the rules, then who

will?
I believe that the Government is here to protect us
from each other and the courts are here and should be here to
protect us from the Government.

And in this case, it is the

defendant who needs protection from the Government because the

39
Government, in this case, has erred.
QUESTION:

What rule did the prosecutor not follow?

MR. GREENSPAN:

He didn’t follow the time honored rule

in the second Circuit, which said that when an individual is
called before a grand jury he is given the information as to
whether or not he is a target.

(laughter)
Now there are a couple of errors that my brother,
the Solicitor General, made to this Court and 1 would like to
point them cut.

First of all. Officer Biro did testify.

QUESTION:

Bid not the judge say he wasn't considering,

his testimony on the merits?
MR. GREENSPAN:

No, he didn't say that at all.

What

he did say is that, "When you take away Lois Hennessey's testi­
mony, Officer Biro's testimony coupled with all the other evi­
dence" was insufficient to convict the defendant.
The other point I-'would like to bring out to the Court.
f

41
is that there was a wiretap in this case and it was incorrectly
pointed, out to this Court by the Solicitor General — I know it
was innocently because he said he wasn't aware of it.

The wire­

tap was one that was conducted by the Westchester County District
Attorney's office, as a result of a wiretap order by the
Honorable Isaac Rubin who is the Admin istrative Judge now in
Westchester County.

There was an intercepted conversation

between Millow and Mr. Ceccollni concerning a conversation
which could be and probably would be interpreted as inculpatory.
However, that wiretap was not brought into the case before
Mr. Justice Gagliardi or before the Second Circuit.
QUESTION:

It was before Justice Gagliardi.

Judge

Gagliardi mentioned it in his order.
MR. GRpHNSPAN:

He mentioned it, but 1 don’t think he

relied on that, sir.
.QUESTION:

How could he mention it if he didn’t know

about it?
MR, GREENS PAH:
lie didn’t know about it.

incuse me,

1 didn't mean to imply

I just didn't believe it was relevant

in the issue.
Now, we turn to a question of double jeopardy.

I

heard the Solicitor General argue quite strenuously for the
fact that you can at any time appeal from any type of an order
the effect of which will be,if you win the appeal, merely to
reinstate a guilty verdict,

And he says that even if the court

42

'-Mould make further findings•that still, that's all right
because all you are going to do is reinstate a guilty verdict.
If that would be the rule that this Court sets, I
'Mould disagree with it wholeheartedly.

I would argue and I

would ask this Court to adopt the rule which says that if the
court, whether it is this CoUrt or the Second Circuit or the
lower court, whoever is given the task of making further
findings, is obligated to make factual determinations of any
kind, then it offends the rule against double jeopardy.

And

I would not permit, if I had the power, to allow a court to make
further findings.
I believe that the .solicitor General is accurate when
tie says that if all the court has to do without making any
further findings of any kind is to reinstate a guilty verdict
than, of course, that the order is appealable or the judgment
:.s appealable without further ado, and this Court has said so.
But if it Is going to add on or melt away the question of
'Do you,*' or "Should you make further findings?" then I would
strenuously argue that it should not be permitted.
findings, otherwise it "s double jepardy.

No further

I believe that's what

the cases say.
I would like just a moment to address something which
I don51 believe has ever been fully argued before this Court,
if it has been argued at all, and that is I believe this Court
should adopt the doctrine of equitable estoppel.

I believe that

the foundation of every exclusionary rule, the foundation of
every rule which says Evidence can or cannot be admitted, that
one can or cannot exercise a privilege or a right, is based
upon the doctrine of clean hands, that the wrongdoer shouldn't
profit by his wrongdoing, that one should not walk into court
w1th unc1ea n ha nds «
I believe this Court in Harris v„ New York, which was
argued unsuccessfully, unfortunately, by my former partner and,
as a matter of interest, argued successfully by the District
Attorney who later became my partner, is simply that one who
does come into court with unclean hands, that is one who is a
perjurer, they can't take advantage of that perjury by getting
cn the stand and perjuring himself anew, that you can use
illegal, evidence to impeach him.

If that be the case, 1 would

argue most strenuously that where the Government is a wrong­
doer, where the Government makes a mistake, where the Government
does something to create something which it really has no right
to, then under that set of circumstances, the Government should
be estopped. The Government has been estopped in civil cases
involving aliens and in tax cases and in other situations»

I

believe it to be the foundation of all of your doctrine of
exclusionary rules, and I would ask this Court to adopt it in
this case to prevent or estop the Government from exercising
any technical right of appeal and saying that from this moment
cn whe Government has to act as a civilized human being just as

44
everyone else.
QUESTION:

If, after the officer had left the florist

she might be gone into this unlawful conduct of her boss, if
then she had gone to the telephone and called the FBI and given
them all the information that she gave the agent some months
later, would you be making these arguments?
MR. GREENSPAN:

I don't believe so, Your Honor,

because I believe what that would be'then ie that she went
there before the agent who discovered her went to the Government
and reported her.

I think then you would have,truly, your

And in this case, the trial judge

said that it was not only possible but even probable that the
FBI would have interviewed Ms. Hennessey later in the course
of the gambling investigation in any event.
Wouldn't probability that the evidence would have
been disclosed anyway be a sufficient intervening cause?
MR. GREENSPAN:

I would say not, Your Honor.

I think

chat that doctrine has been rejected by courts before as being
speculative,

I don't think you. can determine or go off on a

hypothetical of whether they would have or they should have or
they could have.

The fact is that they didn't in this case.

Besides, 1 believe the solicitor General has retreated from
the inevitable discovery argument and doesn't urge it to this
Court.

Of course, this Court isn't bound by the fact that the

Solicitc-r General doesn't urge it, but as a matter of logic
.'£ just don't think it should be in this specific situation.
Not that it isn't an argument that couldn't.be raised in a
proper case,

I don't believe this ie the proper case,

QUESTION:

But if it isn't done in terms of degrees

of probability, how would you phrase the intervening cause?

X mean, you suggest intervening cause should be the test, and
X am just wondering if that's really any different than a kind
of a, sort of a probability test.
MR. GREENSPAN:

Well, I think the question of

foreseeability, the famous case in New York decided many years
ago in Fallstaff y, Long Island Railroad sets -forth the

REBUTTAL URAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. ALLEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE , PETITIONER
MR0 ALLEN:

Thank you., Your Honor.

I would like to address a point Mr, Justice Stevens
made that I didn't answer very adequately with respect to the

48
right of the Government to appeal a suppression motion and the
requirement that there be a judgment.
18 U.S.C,, Section 3731* appears to me to permit a
Government appeal from a decision granting a suppression
motion even after a finding of guilt or a verdict of guilt has
been entered.

The statute says, "An appeal by the United States

lihall lie to a Court of Appeals from a decision or order of a
District Court suppressing or excluding evidence," comma,
'not made after a defendant has been put in jeopardy and
before the verdict or ringing on an indictment or information."
The language would seem to imply that if the sup­
pression order is made after the verdict of finding of guilt,
it may be appealed if the decision is made.

There is not in

she statute any requirement that that decision on a suppression
mot ion be in the form of a judgment.
QULSTION:
MR * A LLiSN:
QUESTION:

Tha t ' s Section 3731 of Tit 1 e 18 ?
T hat fs c or r e c t.
Your point being that if the Congress had

intended only pre-trial motions prior to jeopardy could be
appealable, they wouldn't have gone ahead and added the phrase
"and before the verdict or finding of an indictment or ..."
MR* ALLEN:

That's correct, Your Honor, and in

There was simply a

QUESTION:
was a judgment,

But you agree that here that minute entry

I mean the second one where it said ''that6s

what we are appealing.from."
MR, ALLEN:
QUESTION:
Government's theory.

Yes, Your Honor, I would argue that was.
Just so I am perfectly clear on the
The theory then is that the appeal is

taken pursuant to the second paragraph of 3731, rather than
the first paragraph.

It's the paragraph in which suppression

notions are discussed, rather than dismissal and indictment.
MR, ALLEN:

I wouldn't want to limit us to the

second paragraph, Your Honor, because I think it could be
argued that the effect — If we needed to argue it, I think we
could argue that the effect of Judge Gagliardi's decision was
a dismissal of the indictment.
QUESTION:

Oh, I understand you could, but then this

.anguage you read to me would not be relevant under that theory.
You would not need to rely on that.
MRo ALLEN:

Would not be necessary,

I would rely

irimarily on the second paragraph and I believe the language
clearly gives us a right to appeal,
QUESTION:

But you don't abandon what the Court of

Appeals said at 21(a) of the Appendix to your petition that
this was a judgment.
MR. ALLEN:

I do not abandon that, Your Honor,

I

think that they correctly determined that they were reviewing

a judgment.
