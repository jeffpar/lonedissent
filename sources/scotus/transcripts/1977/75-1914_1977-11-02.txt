MR. CHIEF justice BURGERs

We will hear arguments

next: in 7501914, Monell against Department of Social Services,
City of New York.
Mr. Chase, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF OSCAR G, CHASE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CHASE;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
I am Oscar Chase.

I represent the plaintiffs in

tills action, who consist essentially of two groups of women?
one group was employed by the City of New York at. the time
of the averts alleged in the complaint, the other group was
employed by the Board of Education of the City of New York.
The two groups have in common the fact that they were,
all compelled to take unwanted leaves of absence from their
employment as a result of a compulsory pregnancy rule, of the
kind with which the Court is familiar after Cleveland Board
of Bducatlcn v. LaFleur.
The principal relief sought was injunctive and
declaratory relief as well as an award of lost wages.
After the defendants changed their policies, sometime
after the complaint was filed, the court below dismissed the
declaratory and injunctive request' as moot, and then went on
to dismiss the remaining claim for back pay as wanting in

4

subject, matter jurisdiction*
The court held, and the Court of Appeals affirmed,
that the Board of Education was not a "person"’ within the
meaning of Section 1983, <and then, in the second branch of
the case, held that municipal officials are not "persons"
when monetary relief is sought against them in their
official capacity.
QUESTION: When you say "monetary relief is sought
against them in their official capacity", do you mean monetary
relief to come out of the public treasury in some form?
MR® CHASE 5

That would be the effect of it, yes*

Turning first to the question of whether or not the
Board of Education is a "parson", we must note preliminarily
that thg question is a unitary one in terms of remedial
purposes »
QUESTION;

Just before you go on, in connection

with Brother Relinquish*s question:

There's no finding here

or no issue as to v/hether the individual members are "persons"
for purposes of prospective relief?
MR* CHASE:

That was not. raised for — well, because

that aspect of the case was moot, and no appeal was taken from
that*
But as to the unitary question of the personhood of
the Board of Education, the City qf^Kcmosha JABrao teaches
‘that the personhood is not determinable by reference to the

5
relief sought.

Under 19 83, a person, is a ''person”.

And as to the Board's status in that regard, we
ivould note that the Court is not hare writing on a clean slate*
There is a long line of precedent dealing with school
segregation cases, a line of cases

lamented by some, I

suppos a; supported by most, but agreed, by all — to have
worked a fundamental change in the way tills country educates
its young*
The Court of Appeals rejected the importance of
those cases on-two grounds?

one, the results reached as to

jurisdiction in those cases were reached through inadvertence?
and, secondly, the individuals, members of the Board, ware
named in those cases as wall as as Board members.
These reasons, we submit, are insufficient for
rejecting this established line.
First, as to the fact that they ware, as we concade
in most of these cases, individual defendants as well as Board
members,

Ws would note, though, that the Court has focused

time and again on 55the Board”, the defendant Board, the
respondent Board.

And Mr. Justice Powell, concurring in tee

second Milliken case last term, noted that in the line of
questions commencing with ground, the principal defendant —
I am quoting here or School Board.
In

is usually the local Board of Education

6

QUESTIONS

Wasn’t it to distinguish between a

local Board and a State Board?
MR, CHASE;

Yes, And for purposes of that case it

was relevant, but for the purpose of this case I think the
important thing is that whether the State Board or local Board,
it’s the Board that's the defendant? it's the entity that’s
doing tie wrong,
QUESTION; Well, but, counsel, don’t

you have to take

things in context when you’re talking about a substantive
right to relief, you may not be focusing on who are proper
defendants, and vie© versa?

You know, I don't think you can

taka ©very word as written out of every opinion of -this Court
and say that it decides a question that the Court may not have
been focusing on.
And I thought from

your earlier comment you probably

agreed with, that,
HR, CHASE:

Oh, I do agree with it, Your Honor,

And if we were talking about one or two cases or an 'accidental
reference in an occasional case to a school board, I would not
be presenting this argument.

But we’re dealing here with

a line of cases which, as I mentioned, is fundamental in the
jurisprudence and in the political history of this country.
And its strange belief which this Court has imposed on itself
in another context, the duty of determining whether subject
matter jurisdiction exists in the lower courts, that this

7
Court would then fail to appreciate that problem in cases of
this magnitude,
Of course, it's always open to the Court to re­
address a fundamental point of that nature.

But we would add

that Congress has additionally acted in reliance on those
cases and has also spoken in terms of local educational
agencies j thus Congress — and we cite the statutes in our
brief and in the amicus brief — has allowed attorney's fees
to be provided to prevailing parties where the defendant was
a local educational agency,

hnd the leading case interpreting

that statute, the Bradley case, was a. 19 83 case in which the
defendant was a school board,
Thera's also the statute providing financial
assistance to "local educational agencies bearing the
i

financial burden of a school desegregation order".

So that

where there is the established line and there is congressional
reliance, there would appear' to be really a rule that we have
arrived at which remains only to be announced,
QUESTION:

Well, where a local financial --™ where

a local board bears the burden of a school desegregation order
and gets a grant, from the government, the order could be
perfectly effective prospect;!vel/ through individual school
board members and, nonetheless, impose 'the burden of buying
buses and that sort of thing on the school district, I would
suppose.

Isn't that language of Congress there perfectly

8
reconciliable with that i n terpre t ation?
MR. CHASEs

It; is reconciliable, yes, but it is also

reconciliable, and I think more so, given the language that
Congress chose to use.

They focused on the agency»

It is

re conci liable, I think mors happily, with the point that
appellants present here, Youx- Honor.
Of course, defendants would have this Court turn its
back on that 20 years of decisional law and defendant argues
principally that the logic of Monroe v. Papa requires a
similar holding for these persons, these boards of education
which, it says, "fulfill an important govt:ramenta 1 role".
Let us sea how this would frustrate the statuta,
both its purposes and its language.
1983 is a statute which applies only where there is
color of State law.

It will almost always be the case, if

not always, that a corporation ot* person acting under color
of 1 aw is fulfilling an important governmental role.

So that

under defendants’ viev;, when the statute e.pplies, when you
get into it. you ars also shunted out of it. because you are
really, by definition, fulfilling 'chat important role.
Such a reading would, aside frcr being absurd and,
I submit;, impugning to Congress an intent to pass a meaningless
statutes in that context, such a reading would allow States, if
they were of such a mind, to evade constitutional obligations
by setting up corporations to undertake important governmental

9
roles.
And one thinks of Smith v, Alright where, in another
context,, this Court, said to the Democratic Party of Texas
back in. those days?

You can't set up a jaybird society and

tell us that's not the State of Texas operating the Primaries;,
I think the case is relevant in spirit, if not in
precise holding,,
CUESTION ?
MR« CHASE:
QUESTION:

Mr. Chas a.
Yes, sir?
To what extent is your position

predicated on the view that the Mew York Board of Education
is a separate, entity from the City of New York?
MR. CHASE:

Well, Your Honor, I think that that is

an important ingredient about our case, because under the
Monro® holding a city is simply not a. parson.

And we don't

think our case presents the Court with the necessity/ of re­
considering that holding.
But we think that the record is so clear that the
Board of Education is not an arm of the city, that that
problem -~
QUESTION:

Does it have any power to levy taxes?

MR. CHASE:

No, it does not.

QUESTION:
MR. CHASE:

Or to issue bonds?
No, it doer, not.

But it does have the

power to obtain funds from federal, State, city and private

10

sources *
QUESTIONs

They come from all thrae of those, don't;

they?
MR. CHASE;
QUESTION;
MR. CHASE;

Wall, four? private as well.
Yes.
Although the governmental are naturally

the bulk of it.
Eut one thinks of the Court’s opinion in Mt. Healthy
v. Doy 12, where the question there was whether a school board
was an arm of the State? and the fact, the mere fact that it
got finals from the State there didn't make it an arm of the
State any more than the fact that the Board of Education gets
funds from the city makes it "an arm of the city”.
And we —
QUESTION:

Well, is the Board of Education here

what yon would call a municipal corporation?

Can. sue, be

sued? that sort of thing.
MR. CHASE:

It's a corporation.

corporation, can sue and be sued.

And, like any

It is not a municipal

corporation in the sense that it (a) does not have power to
administer within a geographic area and, perhaps more to the
point, under New York law it is not so considered. The Nav.
York Constitution defines very specifically "local government"
as "a county, city, town or village"? it does not include it
under decisional lav;. And there are similar provisions in the

11
general municipal law* which are even more —
QUESTIONt

Well* it's not a private corporation*

MR* CHASE;

It's not a private Corporation*

QUESTIONS

It's not a municipal corporation*

So what is it?
MR* CHASEs
that's in between*

No, it isn't. Well* it's an entity
It's a ~~

QUESTIONs What does the State of New York say it is?
MR* CHASE; A corporation chartered under the rules
of the State, which is separate and distinct from the city*
which has the capacity to sue and be sued, and has the
responsibility to administer education
QUESTION;

And where will I find that?

MR, CHASE:

— in the — excuse ms, Your Honor?

QUESTION;

Is chat statute here soma place in the

record?
MR* CHASE: Well* it's both decisional law and
statutory lav, and it's set out in our brief.
QUESTION;

I see.

MR. CHASE;

Yes, Your Honor*

QUESTION:

Does the Const!tutior of New York provide

for Boards of Education as constitutional entities?

This is

true in my State of Virginia, for example.
MR. CHASE;

No, the Conati tutior provides 'that

education is a power — that the control c f education is a

12
power reserved t:o the State# and excludes it# interestingly#
on the constitutional point — it’s excluded from the home
rule provisions of the New York Constitution# which do define
the sphere of influence of cities# and is a further indicia
of th© fact that it is not an arm of the city,,
But it’s primarily in statutory law# Your Honor#
that th© board is established as a separate entity.

It’s

in the Hew York education lav/.
Nov/# Your Honors, I had addressed the point as to
how the defendants’ position would frustrate the language of
the statute# and let’s taka a look now atthe purposes of
the statute and how this argument fits in there.
The purpose of Section 1983 is revealed in the title
by which it- is referred to in the statutes at large and in tie
debates?

An Act to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth

Amendment„
And I may say parenthetically that in Monroe the
Court referred to it as the Ku Klux Act# which. I think,
frankly, while somawhat accurate, is a misnomer.

The true

purpose, the true title was an Act to enforce the provisions
of the Fourteenth Amendment.

And it's been agreed that that

purpose was its primary purpose.

Even Justice Frankfurter#

in his dissent in Monroe# said that the purpose of Section 1
of -this Act of 1871 was to protect against constituti, on a 1
violations through the authority enhanced by the majesty and

13

dignity of the Stats*
Just as here we have this corporation set

up by

•the board, given some powers -- by the State — and then it,
in this case, has violated people’s rights*

It’s the very

situation in which the. statute, Section 1, was intended to
apply*
And when the Legislature, when Congress used the
words "all persons are liable” it clearly intended to include
such corporations.
We know this because, first, the common understanding
of idle *tenn "corporation” — of "persons" in a legal sense?
included corporations*
as 1838,,

This Court said as much in, as early

It was just an axiom, unless someone tells us

otherwise, the term "persons" in a statute means corporation;?*
And beyond that we have the Dictionary Ac ", adopted
by the same Congress of 1871, which said in it that? You
may takes it that we mean corporations as well as coicporeal
persons when w@ use the term "person”*
Now, counsel is quite aware that ’the Dictionary
Act was rejected as precedent as binding in the Monroe case
because in Monroe the Court found a special intent to treat
municipalities differently from other persons; and we submit
that no such finding can be made with regard to -this kind of
corporation.
And let me explain why this is so,

14
First, the Sherman amendment in terms would have
imposed liability on cities for acts of violence done within
their borders, in terms, excuse me, "on the county, city or
parish", quote, unquote, in which the riotous acts occurred.
There was no discussion of corporations such as the Beard of
Education which exists for a particular purpose, and such
discussion would have been absurd.

No one would have thought

to impose liability on a Board of Education, if they had
thought of it, because riotous acts occurred in the school
district.
But I think even more important Boards of Education
were creatures that were only barely gaining their own under
American law at the time of these debates.

Certainly they

were never mentioned during the debates. There is no indica­
tion that they were before the Congress.

We just don’t know

what Congress would have thought about, its powers to impose
liabilities on these creatures of law, even if we do know
what Congress thought about its power vis-a-vis the
municipalities.
So that a holding which would extend the legislative
history reading in Monroe, yet further to include these
entities, would really rest, if I may say so, on the .legis­
lative history of imagination,of surmise, rather than the
legislative history of scholarship.
An additional point on the relevance of the Sherman

15

Amending at is that we must recall that the Sherman Amendment
was an additional section to the Act of 1871,

It would have

been tacked on the end -~
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

W©*1I resume tier© at

one o’clock, counsel,
MR, CHASE: Thank you, Your Honor,
[Whereupon, at 12:00 noon, the Court was recessed,
to reconvene at Is00 p,m„, the same day,]

AFTERNOON SESSION
[ 1 s 0 2 p o in * ]
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Counsel, you may

continue.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF OSCAR G0 CHASE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS — Resumed
MR,, CHASE;

Thank you, Your Honor.

Your Honor, at tills point I would like to turn,
with tins Court’s permission, to the second aspect of our
positions

that the defendants cart be required, under Section

1983 — that is, the official defendants can be required to
use their official powers to make whole the plaintiffs. That
is, they caa be required, in the words of this Court in
Griffin v. Prince Edward County, to use the power that is
theirs no remedy the wrongs that they have done.
Now, let me begin by saying that here, unlike
plaintiffs’ claim against the School Board, it is undeniable
that an order to the defendant Mayor in his official
capacity will have some impact on the municipality, and 'thus
the remit in Monroe is, at least, arguably, relevant.
But we contend it is not determinative, because
it is beyond dispute that the defendants ace, in their
officie,X capacity, subject to 19 83, for injunctive end other
purposes«
And it was held in Kenosha that -She quality of

17
psrsonhood does not: depend on the ■type of relief sought»
QUESTION:

If there is no money available — let

us assume hypothetically

for some legal reasons, could

others be compelled to enact legislation or nudce appropriations
or raise th© money by borrowing it in order to pay?

Or, if

they ha/e borrowing power, could they be compelled to exercise
that borrowing power?
MR. CHASE :
QUESTION:
MR. CHASE:

You mean the official defendants?
Yes.
No, Your Honor, I don't think so,

because, under Stats law which at least might apply to that
end of idle case, the liability of the defendants is limited
to such amounts as are in the treasury, even in their
officia.', capacities.

That's in General Municipal Law,

Section 70 of the New York. Code.
So that I don't think

- I think the situation would

there be, as in any ca.se in which the defendant turns out to
be judgment-proof, the plaintiff gets a judgment but he can't
enforce it.

Still plaintiffs would prefer to get the judgment

end worry about enforcing it later.
QUESTION:

But don't you think the courts have to

think about that.?
MR. CHASE:

No, Your Honor, I don't, because I think

that a rule of subject matter jurisdiction or a rule of
remedial scope should not turn on the likelihood that defendants

18
eitlier can or will pay the judgment»

I think that those are

ve ry sap arate .
QUESTION: Well, -that’s casting it in somewhat
different terms from my inquiry.

If you were talking about

two private parties, that certainly would be true, the courts
aren’t concerned with it.
MR. CHASE:

Yes»

QUESTIONs

But we're talking about public money

MR. CHASE:

Yes. And I think that trie general

her© now,

principle i3 the same.

I don’t think that, the Court should

erect special rules to protect public enti ties unless
Congress has done so, where they are otherwise subject to the
terms o: the statute.
QUESTION; Would the individual defendants in the
capacity you’re talking about have the same good-faith
reasonable typo of defense that 'they would haves to a damages
action against them personally in this capacity?
MR. CHASE: Well, Your Honor, that — I believe not.
Because of the special reasons that run, that the Court
mentioned and so forth? but I think that, that is a question
that is not before the Court.
concede.

It’s a difficult question, I

It’s one that, had the defendants properly raised ~

ox- perhaps may even have a chance to raise below if this
Court reverses — w© would appreciate an opportunity to

19
cor.vinca the lower court; and maybe ultimately this Court on,
MR

3

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I should say to counsel

in this case,, by fee way, that Mr» Justice Brennan is
unavoidably absent, but has heard part of the arguments and
will participate in the case on the basis of the tape
recordings of the oral arguments and, of course, all the
records,
MR» CHASE;

We understand, Your Honor»

I was about to say that a logically consistent
system of 1983 jurisprudence would require — taking into
account the Kenosha, case and the other cases that we cite in
our brief, in which the Court has affirmed lower court
holdings — ordering defendants in their official capacity
to make restitution to plaintiffs,

That those cases require

a similar holding hers.
And I think it's fair to say that this is an issue
that cannot b© decided in either direction without some
infringement on stars decisis principles»

The Court is

caught between conflicting lines of cases, and I suggest -feat
plaintiffs’ position is the best v/ay to resolve them, because
it looks., back to the fundamental purpose of Section 19 83;
the purpose of protecting constitutional rights and enforcing
the Fourteenth Amendment»
Anything which would be? found in the legislative
history that might be contrariwise, or was in the context of

20

the Sherman Amamdmsnt, which was really not terribly relevant
to Section. 1 at all»
And in so far as the Monroe case does stand against
the position that plaintiffs taka, we would make at least
three points0
In Monroe, the city was the defendant.

So that just

in the narrow star© decisis the case is implicable.
Second and more broadly, plaintiffs do not here
seek to render Monroe meaningless.

We are not saying that the

plaintiffs in Monroe could have sued Mayor Daley of Chicago
and obtained a judgment because soma police officer beat them
up.

Mayor Daley, in that case, lid not wrongfully exercise

his official powers.
The .analogy is very close to Rizzo v, Goode, when
then Police Commissioner Rizzo could not be held liable,
the Court thought, because soma of his officers had run amuck,
allegedly.

Nor could, under our view, the plaintiff in

Monroe sue the police officer, because the — in his official
capacity —■ because the police officer, in -that capacity,
has no authority tc. dispense public funds to make whole
inj ured plaintif fs.
So that the integrity of Monroe is aot necessarily
at issue here.
And I would like, with that background, to
QUESTIONS

In other words, as I understand it,

21
your argument: in this phase of the case is not. at all dependent
upon a respondeat superdor theory?
MR. CHASE;
QUESTION t
MR. CHASEi

No, Your Honor.

We believe that —

Not a bit?
Not at all.

The defendants themselves

acted wrongfully, so w@ allega.
QUESTION i
QUESTION;

Yes«,
Well, what if the School Board member

says, "I've done all I can to give you back pay, but I don't
have tile money", and then "I get my money from the city"?
then — is he 'then like a police officer?
MR. CHASE:

Well, if the federal district judge

orders idle School Board or Its members to make restitution
and they, in the normal course of their business, as they
would, issue a directive or a voucher to the holder of their
funds, ^he City Comptroller, that is all they could be
reasonably expected to do, yes.
And I would assume, in the normal course of events,
that:, as under State law, the Comptroller is required to pay
money on vouchors lawfully issued by the board, and h© would
pay it.
QUESTION; Would you have a stronger case if you
cam© from somewhere else than New York, do you thin}:?
MR. CHASE;

If w© cams

financit ,1 m nb arras sments

oh, because of New York's

22
[Laughter] ,
MR * CHASE t

Well, Your Honor,. I like to think, as

I said to the Chief Justice, that that will not be relevant
to making a. ruling that's going to b© applicable for those
other cities that may be better managed or luckier, possibly ,
I would further urge that our position
QUESTION; Would you be here making tee same claim
if th©:oa had been no claim for equitable relief other than
this so-called restitutionary claim?
MR, CHASE;

If there had never been an action for

injunction?
QUESTION;
MR, CHASE;

Yes,
Well, that raises the question, really,

I thin!:, if I may, of whether or not this restitution stands
in law or equity, and I'm not sure that this is the kind of
issue that the difference is important.

I think this is

QUESTION; So you — why don't you just say that "I'm
.-.suing tee School Board or its members, I can sue them in law
and get money even if the city has to pay it"?
To teat extent, Monroe just doesn't reach it,
That is really your position, isn't it?
MR, CHASE;

That is really our position, yes, sir,

I think we should state that.
In this case I should say that the case does arise
in the context of an injunctive action, and teat it's traditional

23
that: restitution, is considered an incident of equity.

But.

after the abolition of law and equity distinction, I'm not
sure how terribly important it is.
I think the power is there in the district courts
Because if the power is not there, using the defendants'
approach, a defendant official would be subject to Section
1983 because h® has official powers*

And than whan the court

seeks to order him to exercise those official powers, it would
b© the very same powers that he would use to says

"Oh, no,

you can't do that to me, because that would be the saw*® as
having ;m impact on the entity that I serve."
So, her© again, it would be a way of making the
statute» if you will, consume itself.

And I don't think teat's

what Congress had in mind.
Now, the lower court was impressed by thin Eleventh
Amendment analogy that it found, and I would like to address
myself to that.
The Eleventh Amendment, of course, is a prohibition.
It says teat tee re shall be no suite by a citizen against a
Stats.

And I have great difficulty in analogizing that

provision, which is wholly negative, to a provision which had
as its prime purpose an expansive view of federal power to
protect; constitutional rights.
Secondly, I find it difficult to believe that the
Congress that enacted Section 1903 had in its mind this

24
Eleventh Amendment, construct, when Ex Parte Young was not, even
decided until about 1908, and this is a Congress that could
never, I don’t think, have contemplated the unusual chain of
events -that, led to Ex Parta Young, which has resolved those
competing considerations there relevant.
If there is an intent to insulate municipalities,
it can be found in only on© place, and that is in tie
rejection cf the so-called Sherman Amendment that would have
made cities vicariously liable for acts that it didn’t commit,
that were committed within its borders.
And in Monroe, of course, the Court read the
rejection of the Sherman Amendment to mean that Congress had
decided it iad no power to impose "liability" on cities«
But, of course, that’s differant than saying that
the Congress thought that it had to insulate the cities from
©van this ancillary effect of orders against those whom it —
or concede it did have power to effect.
Secondly, we think that the Court in Monroe read
the legislative history rather too broadly.

In the vary

languages that Mr. Justice Douglas quoted in Monroe, ha
quoted Representative Poland, who was a Reconstruction
Republican, believed four-square in the Fourteenth Amendment,
but said, in this one speech that Mr. Justice Douglas quoted,
that: Wti don't have the power to impose, and I quote,
"obligations" on municipalities.

25
And we

ink that the correct reading of that

legislative' his tori? was something like this .

Even the

Recons tructdon Republicans recognised that in 1871 there was
no power tc say to a city;

You shall have a police fore® ~~

on the part, of the Congress, "You shall have a police force,
you shall police what goes on in your neighborhood1' , and so
forth. The States decided what the obligations of tie cities
were.
That being the case, they ssiids

How can we in

good faith, or even constitutionally, tell, them "you're
liable for not doing Id,at which we don’t haw the power to
tell you to do in th® first place".
And I don’t have the time to rend from the record,or
from til** briefs, but I think that Your Honors will find that
tlie key Republicans who

wesb

in support of this basic approach

of Section 19 83 did have difficulty, but only on the- score.
They believed they had the power to impose liability, but not
obligations, on municipalities.
And so we find that th® Eleventh Amendment analogy
is simply not supported by reference to the record.

Congressmen,

like Congressman Kerr, who was against everything they did, he
was a Democrat who thought th© Fourteenth Amendment did not
give the; powers that the Republicans thought.

I don’t think

the Court should look to his quotes and use them to interpret
a law that he was against right from A to Z.

26

So we think that the legislatives history does not
support tills special intent to protect municipalities.
tod I will, if Your Honor please, reserve the rest of
my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF L. KEVIN SHERIDAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. SHERIDAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pla&s©

the Court:
In answer to questions concerning the. status of the
defendant Board of Education, the New York law indicates that
tills a hybrid entity.

The State Constitution provides that

every child shall be guaranteed a free public education.
There*;-} provision in the Stata Constitution, for a State Board
of Regents and a Commissioner of Education.
Certain State cases indicate that for pedagogical
purposes, at the vary least, Boards of Education are arms of
the State, coming perilously close to an Eleventh Amendment
defense being available, we can’t urge that in light of this
Court's Mt._Healthy decision.
Other cases indicate that, based upon its city
funding, its relationship under the City Charter, with the City,

27
under the Education Law with respect to appointment of members
of Boards of Education, that it is a city agency,
I don’t think that’s dispositi vs? of a determination
in this case, Your Honors? there can be absolutely no dispute,
it performs a critical, expensive, important governmental
function.
This Court, in National League of Citi.es v. Usery,
treated Boards of Education and public hospital systems as
just as clearly governmental entities as what we generally
think of as municipal corporations„
To answer Mr. Justice Marshall’s question, or to
attempt to answer it, "Is it a municipal corporation?
do you call it?"

What

I think we would fairly characterize it as

a quasi-municipal corporation.

I think McQuillin, on

Municipal Corporations, would probably discuss it that way.
There are a host of arrangements whex*eby local
Boards of Education are establishad.
Right now, the Mayor of the City of New York would
like to have it a clearly city agency with him appointing &
local Chancellor.
If that would affect the outcome of this case,
because we change the nature of the appointment, and what’s

Your Honors,, I’m not quits sure I understand my
opponents' argument.

At one point he says Monroe vs. Pape is

not in this case, it doesn't have to be dispositive here.
The next moment he's arguing it was incorrectly decided.
I’d like to speak briefly on that point.
Justice Douglas, in Monroe vs. Pap©, Justice
Marshall in floor vs. County of A lama da, Justice Rehnquist in
City of Kenosha and, I might add, Mr. Justice Brennan in his
dissent in Aldinger vs. Iloward, all discussed the legislative
history of what is now 1983.

Uniformly, no dissent on this

issuei not intended to reach local governmental subdivisions.
Congress in 1961, I believe it was, has acquiesced
in ‘this view.

There is presently pending .in both the Senate

and til© House a measure

it's Senate 35, introduced by

Senator Mathias in the Senate — proposing to overrule that
decision as well as Imbler _vs. Pachtmen and various other
cases.
Congress has been aware of th© interpretation placed
upon 1933 by tills Court.

It has acquiesced in this inter-

protationwhich, to most lawyers, meant you couldn’t get a
money judgment against a municipality.
When Congress was dissatisfied with the Alyeska Pineline decision, the next year it changed the law, at least on
civil rights action.
I’d suggest that these consid@rat.lons indicate that

33
this master is appropriately to bs addressed by Congress,
which has acquiesced for 15 years in this line of decisions.
In a sense, Your Honors have engrafted onto the statute an
important judicial gloss that takes on independent meaning»
But if we're going to re-examine the intent of the
Congress in 1871, I would suggest that that Congress was not
only not aware of the need for devising & fiction, such as
Ex Parte Young represents, but it: never would have seen any
need to.

This was a statute directed at nightriders, the

Ku Klux Klan and State officials who -would not accord justice
to people injured.
Today — and I take no issue with this — it
guarantees to public employees their job security, it guarantees
to welfare recipients the right to a pre-termination hearing?
it may even provide for notice to cut off gas and electric
companies.

It's come a long, long way.
And sometimes we've had Boards of Education or cities

named defendants in a 1983 action.
QUESTION:

And it remained morabund for a long time,

too, didn’t it?
MR. SHERIDAN:

It certainly did, Your Honor, and I

come from a city where the tradition of liberalism is fairly
widespread, and I’m not going to take issue with the develop­
ment of this law.
In one sens© tills has become a great charter of

34

liberties v analogous to the Sherman Act

not the Sherman

Amendment, the Sherman, Act — on the economic side»
I appreciate that.

Nobody wants to roll the clock

back»
But let's look at the context in which relief has
been accorded, and let's look at the relief accorded.
Typically, injunctive declaratory relief.

And, incidentally,

maybe damages? I know that.
But before this Court in the LaFleur case, City of
Cleveland Board of Education, it was primarily — primarily
should they get an order striking down mandatory maternity
leave?

The Court noted i.n the opinion that appropriate

damages or injunctive relief be granted, back pay reinstated.
As far as I’m aware, tills is the first case teat
squarely poses to this Court the issue of how this statute
should be construed, when what is really at issue is damages.
And this is an equitable restitution, it’s not, some sort, of
equitable decree, this is just like the money judgment you get
and you can sail the property on the courthouse steps.
QUESTION: And you're saying, I take it, teat it
wouldn't make any difference if this School Board were — had
its own sources of funds, had its own taxing powers?
MR. SHERIDAN:

Your Honor, I can’t predict the

outcome of this case' ~~
QUESTION: Well, I know, but you're making teat

35

argument, aren't you?
MR. SHERIDANs

I think to the extent we're going to

engage in formalistic type distinctions, then my case is

don’t know what the district court would say were the remedies
of the plaintiffs in this context.
It is so unorthodox, what these people proposes.
I mean, if you order the Chancellor of the Board of Education
to integrata schools, to bus, and if he doesn't do it your
remedy is clear:

contempt.

If he doss certain other Idlings, and there's no
guarantee that the city is going to pay his contempt judgment;
maybe there's an indemnity clause statute, 'there’s no guarantee.
If he's sued in his individual capacity because he
unconstitutionally dismissed a child from school, and there's
a damage aware; absent, an indemnity statute which this Court
has held irrelevant to the determination of this issue in the
Moor case —QUESTION: Well, of course, the city — neither th©
City nor th© Comptroller is a party to -this case.
MR. SHERIDAN;
Your Honor.

They are the real party in interest.

They really are.

QUESTION;

We all know that.

Do you think that if the judgment 'wasn't

could be held in contempt?
MRo SHERIDAN;

I don’t

they don’t have the Comptroller.
QUESTIONs

Before you leave this hypothetical,

Justi.ce White's hypothetical — I took it that way — does that
have some elements of an advisory opinion of the Court, to
say this is what ought to be done, that we expressly say that
the Comptroller doesn't have to pay any attention to it?
And individual defendants do not have to respond in a money
judgment?
MR. SHERIDANs

Your Honor, if the Court is going to

ad vis® the parties that a judgment can. be entered that the
parties don't have to

pay any attention to, then I think

that that judgment is wrong.
QUESTION;

It doesn’t make any sense to

to be concerned about whether tha Court’s judgment, if it was

a case of this kind;

how the judgment is paid in

Your opponent says we shouldn't be

concerned with that, and I guess your side of tha case thinks
perhaps we should.
Supposing we had a case on its facts, like Monroe v.
Pap?., where police officers were guilty of misconduct, and the
police chief and so forth, and tin ere were a judgment, for
damages against the New York police officers, would that
judgment be paid from municipal funds?
MR. SHERIDAN;

It would, Your Honor, only pursuant to

a local indemnity statute.

And in not all cases,

We pick and

choose, frankly, the cases in which we will indemnify
QUESTION % But. in deciding whether or not to impose
liability, should that fact be considered by the trial court
in the 1983 action?
And, if not in a police officer case, why should it
be so in a School Board case?
MR. SHERIDAN:

Your Honor, I'm not sure I fully

comprehend the point of tills line of questioning, but I do
recall that in Mr. Justice Marshall's Moor vs. County of
A large da opinion, it. was mentioned, the fact that there was a
local — State statute indemnifying the officials sued -there.
And it was urged there that this should affect the outcome
of that case.
The Court specifically rejected that line of
reasoning.

But what I think is critical here is not whether

there's indemnity or what local officials are going to do,
I raise the question ofs

Do you have a judgment that makes

Your Honors, -the same need for a fiction — and
this Court itself has characterised Ex Parte Young as devising
a fictional remedy.
here.

And why?

The same need for a fiction is called for

I’ll b© blunt.

When it comas to damages,

and damage actions, 19 83 is about: a blunderbuss an instrument
as there exists.

It is not tailored to the situation.

It’s

not like Title VII, where you have procedures to go through

43
and Units the discretion of the court with respect, to back
pay»

Here, you establish liability, and they say, ipso facto,

we get -the judgment»
You show the liability and the damages, and that’s
it.

The cese is over»
In a line of cases involving officials, aad whatever

immunity they enjoy for -their official action, this Court has
placed a gloss on 1983 by reference to common law immunity»
I'm not asking for a common law immunity to be
found somewhere.

I think ray job is easy, Your Honors.

I'm

saying here, w® know what the intent of the Congress was.
No such judgments allowed again municipalities or local
subdivisions of States.

We don't have to look to Harper and

James on the Law of Torts.
Your Honors, if the plaintiffs, petitioners here,
prevail in this case, they will have opened up a major area
for litigation which will be ruinously expensive for
municipalities, Boards of Education.

There is no action

taken by government officals today that, probably ten, fifteen
years ago or later, will not be subject to constitutional
litigation.

And we may lose»

The best of good faith, under

this theory, is irrelevant.
^

Now, under these circumstances, Your Honors, if
these plaintiffs in their class action, certified class action,
— 1 don't know how many were involved in this case, it could

conceivably b© tens of millions — where they are not without
remedies , they can seek a preliminary injunction in the
district court, they can go to the State court and jet
relief.

Thera is a balance that must be struck.
I think it's a fairly obvious balance.

Without

being slavish to the intent of an 1871 Congress, the Court can
consider, as it has in earlier cases, what that Congress
intended and give effect to it; not just because of the
strictures about statutory5 construction in judicial legis­
lation, that doesn’t always decide cases.

I'd suggest that

when you study and consider balance, the considerations, the
equities here, it just doesn't make sense to allow a blunder­
buss instrument such as this to be made available.

We’re

not talking about equitable restitution; we're really talking
about damages, and we're talking about damages paid to
classes of people, Lord knows how large the classes will be,
what the amounts in question will be.
And if the deeper pocket theory ©f tort recovery is
to operat», real politics of tort analysis, I'd add also:
the pocket isn't deep, it's broad.

It's not deep.

It's not irrelevant that the cities are in trouble,
that they're having trouble providing essential services;
it's net Irrelevant that the city can practically go into
bankruptcy, or that they are not judgment-proof.
