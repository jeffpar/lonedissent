MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 76-1168, Arizona v. George Washington, Jr.
Mr. Neely, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN D. NEELY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. NEELY:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
We are here in this matter on petition for writ of
certiorari to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals granted by this
Court on April 13, 1977, pursuant to 28 United States Code,
section 1254.
The case involves ultimately the question of whether
the state is barred from retrying George Washington, Jr. by the
double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution.

It

involves more precisely a factual situation involving the grant­
ing of a mistrial by state trial judge without the defendant’s
consent because of improper remarks made by the defense counsel
during his opening statement,, the issue being whether the state
is properly barred from retrying the defendant in federal
habeas proceedings solely because of the trial judge's failure
to make specific findings based on the standards set out in
Jorn regarding his actions.
The facts are lengthy and have been in dispute
throughout this matter.

Essentially, George Washington, Jr. is

4
presently in the custody of Sheriff Boykin, Sheriff of Pima
County, Arizona, accused of the murder of one James Hemphill,
lie was originally tried and convicted of this offense in May of
1971.

He was granted a new trial in June of 1973.

The basis

for the granting of the new trial was the state's failure to
comply with this Court's ruling in the Brady case.

Ultimately,

a denial of due process was found and the new trial was granted
on the grounds of newly discovered evidence.
The state appealed that matter, that decision of the
Arizona Supreme Court.

The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed the

finding of the trial court in June of 1974 in a memorandum
opinion.

The fact that it was a memorandum opinion becomes

important, later during the course of the facts.
A new trial was held in the matter in January of 1975,
shortly following the defendant's motion for continuance on the
grounds that he didn^t have all his witnesses ready and able to
go to trial.
QUESTION:

Was Judge Truman the trial judge in both

cases, both the first trial and the second trial?
MR. HEELY:

No, Your Honor.

Judge Truman was not and

there —
QUESTION:
MR. NEELY;

There were two different trial judges?
Yes, Your Honor.

Shortly after the commencement of the trial, there
was questioning on voir dire of the jury engaged in by the

5
prosecutor in the case? Mr. Butler? regarding credibility of
witnesses wherein reference was made to the possible use of
transcripts from -- and I use his terra — two prior proceedings.
At the end of that time? counsel for the defense moved for a
mistrial on the grounds that the reference to the prior proceed­
ings was prejudicial to the defendant and that motion was denied.
Shortly thereafter? defense counsel commenced his
voir dire.

At that time? he informed the panel that the de­

fendant had in fact been previously tried for the offense and
in fact been convicted of the offense and had in fact spent some
time in prison in the State of Arizona.
Sometime subsequent to that? there was sane indication
by the trial court judge about his concern about the poisoning
of the panel in this matter? requests by the prosecutor to con­
duct individual voir dire? which was conducted at short length?
to determine whether or not in fact any of the prospective
jurors were aware of the reason behind the granting of the
original new trial.
Subsequently? the opening argument or opening state­
ment commenced.

During the course of the opening statement

given by defense counsel? there were comments regarding miscon­
duct by the prosecutor? conanents regarding the prosecutorSs
willful withholding of evidence? the removal of the previous
prosecutor from the case apparently as a result of this? and
finally there was a comment to the effect that the jury was told

6
that they would hear that because of these things the Arizona
Supreme Court granted a new trial in the matter»
The lunch recess was held shortly thereafter, there
was a motion made by the prosecutor in the case for a mistrial;
the grounds for thatmotion were that due to the improper statements of defense counsel, the jury had been prejudiced.

The

trial court listened to argument, quite length argument regard­
ing the propriety of granting a mistrial at that point; based
upon the comments made by defense cou sel, indicated some re­
luctance to rule at that time on the admissibility of the matter
referred to regarding the Supreme Court, denied the motion and
granted the prosecutor the opportunity to reopen the motion at.
a later time.
The court at that time expressed soma concern about
the case turning into one in which the county attorney's office
was being put on trial.

After that, two witnesses were called

to testify and did in fact testify.

The following morning,

after further research on the matter, the prosecutor again moved
for a mistrial, citing two Arizona rules, one of which precludes
.reference to a past trial at a new trial, the other which forbids
the citation of memoranda opinions.

As I mentioned earlier, the

opinion sustaining the finding of the need for a new trial by
the Arizona Supreme Court was a memorandum opinion.

There was

again extensive argument during which the subject of manifest
necessity was raised, during which both counsel argued on the

7
possible question of taint of the jury panel by the statements
made by defense counsel, and as well defense counsel suggested
the possibility of curity of admonition and the state argued
against it by virtue of what it deemed to be the prejudice to
the jury as a result of defense counsel’s comments,
QUESTION?

The rule of court that you referred to,

was that still a rule of court that was still in effect?
MR, NEELY:
QUESTION:

I'm sorry, Your Honor?
The rule of court that you referred to as

having been mentioned by the prosecutor —
MR. NEELY:

Not the original one, Your Honor.

The

original case took place —
QUESTION:

The statement you just made is what I am

addressing my question to, the rule referred to, a rule which
was at that time still in effect?
MR. NEELY:

Yes, Your Honor, and the rule regarding

the memorandum opinion is still in effect,, that they are not
considered citation for the purposes of authority.
QUESTION:
MR. NEELY:

Yes.
Other than, within very limited circum­

stances that have been referred to by the Ninth Circuit, Your
Honor.
Ultimately, after the extensive argument was concluded
for the second time, the court indicated that it was ready to
rule and essentially ruled that the mistrial was going to be

8
granted based upon defendant.1’ s remarks concerning the Arizona
Supreme Court case.
Subsequently there was special action filed by
Washington's counsel challenging the ruling of the court.

That

special action was filed with the Arizona Supreme Court,, who
declined jurisdiction.

Oar special action really incorporates

all three of the extraordinary writs, and presumably this is in
the nature of either cert or prohibition.
The following step was to file a motion to quash the
information in the Superior Court.
Birdsall and denied.

This was heard by Judge

And sometime during this period counsel

had also filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus with the
federal court and had been told that his state remedies had not
yet been exhausted.
The

ultimate step in state court was the filing of a

habeas petition to the Arizona Supreme Court, again challenging
our right to put Mr. Washington on trial again.

That petition

was denied, and finally the matter was undertaken by the Federal
District Court.
During the course of the proceedings before the
Federal District Court, Judge Walsh raised on his ovm motion
\

the question of whether or not the findings of the trial court
reflected manifest necessity or reflected that the trial court
had specifically found that there was jury prejudice involved.
The court indicated that there had bean a rather

9

extensive review of the record by himself prior to asking this
question and indicated in effect that his main question that
remained was what are the findings, indicating at the same time
that if the findings were there to the effect that, the court
had found a manifest necessity before granting a mistrial or
had found jury prejudice, that that would settle it — and I use
his terms — for him.
QUESTION:

When you say "the court," you have used it

in t er chang ea bly.
MR. NEELY:
QUESTION:

I3m sorry.
You used it when you referred to Judge

Walsh and the other time you were referring to the Superior
Court.
MR. NEELY:

I apologise, Your Honor.

This is — we

are now in the District Court in the federal habeas petition,
and Judge Walsh is the one who indicated that he had reviewed
the record and essentially raised the issue of whether or not
there had been specific findings with regard to either manifest
necessity being existent or with regard to jury prejudice being
existent.

He indicated that he felt under ordinary circum­

stances after his review of the record that the trial judge had
thought so, then he should have said so, and essentially at
that point said in his own words that that would settle it for
me.

He went ahead and ruled that habeas should follow.

The

case was then taken to the Ninth Circuit Court, and the Ninth

10

Circuit Court again based its ruling in affirming the District
Court on the fact that there had been no specific findings by
the trial court with respect to the question of manifest neces
sity with respect to the question of alternatives available to
the jury.
QUESTION:
MR. NEELY:
.QUESTION:

Which opinion is controlling?
Under these circumstances?
You had one opinion with two judges and

one opinion with one judge and all that trouble.
MR. NEELY:

Do you mean the Ninth Circuit’s opinion,

Your Honor?
QUESTION:
MR. NEELY:

Yes.
I have had a great deal of difficulty in

understanding the purpose of the concurring opinion.

It addresses

itself to the question that there was a great deal of argument
at the time of the original trial, the second trial in Superior
Court before Judge Buchanan regarding impropriety.

It appeared

to me at that time that that was a logical course for the
argument to take,but the Ninth Circuit's concurring opinion
doesn’t seem to think so.
QUESTION:
MR. NEELY:

But both of them were against you?
That's correct, there is no question about

that, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

I still don’t know which one is here, be-

cause two judges went one way and the concurring opinion, and

11
one judge wrote for all three of them.
MR. NEELY;

Well, I don't think that the impact of the

two opinions is substantially different, but I believe that we
are properly here on the basis of the original opinion that was
not noted to be a concurring opinion.
QUESTION;

But the point is, the judgment was for all

three.
MR. NEELY;

Yes, Your Honor.

It is our position at this point that there are a
number of issues that are before this Court, but that the first
issue that must be addressed by the Court is the question of
whether or not it was proper for either the District Court or
the Ninth Circuit to conclude that in the absence of specific
findings by the trial court, that, they were therefore prohibited
from upholding the state's position in denying the petition for
writ of habeas corpus.
Our position here today is that this goes one step
beyond previous requirements of this Court, in the sense that,
this Ccu.rt has specifically maintained in the past that the
question of whether or not a

mistrial is properly granted is a

question of whether or not the trial court has abused its dis­
cretion.

The Court has consistently maintained from the days of

Perez onward that it requires a consideration of all the cir­
cumstances, which in our judgment would certainly inake the
finding of facts dealing with all the circumstances somewhat

12
onerous for the trial court.

But in any event, there has never

to my knowledge been a holding that specifically says that the
position of the court cannot be upheld and that jeopardy must
by necessity attach precluding retrial merely because the trial
judge failed to make specific findings of fact on these issues
presented of manifest necessity and the question of alternatives,
when the record clearly supports the fact that there was ex­
tensive argument in the case,that the trial court expressed on
more than one occasion in this instance his concern over the
possibility of a poisoned panel, his concern over the possibil­
ity of the county

attorney8s office being put on trial, and

clearly his concern over the impropriety of comments made by
defense counsel to the jury.
The arguments of counsel were lengthy.

At one point,

the trial court denied the motion for mistrial, giving leave
to reopen it, which indicates certainly that he wasn’t taking
his responsibility lightly.

Arad finally, upon ultimate argu­

ment , granted the motion for mistrial because of the impropriety
of the remarks and presumably the circumstances surrounding it.
I think that the essence of the opinion in the court
immediately below is such that it requires trial courts essen­
tially to make lists, if you would, of findings which taken at
face value would relieve the appellate courts of the opportunity
of going into the record.
It has never boen my understanding, nor do I read that

13
in the cases that have been cited by this Court, that when. the
question of an abuse of discretions, particulary involving double
jeopardy is involved, that the Appellate Court is precluded
merely by conclusory findings of fact by the trial court from
delving

into the record.
QUESTION s

You think the ultimate question is in a

case like this, whether or not there was manifest necessity, in
other words, not -- and there might not have been, even though
the trial judge found that there was, and. there might have been
even though the trial judge had neglected, to put a label on it.
Is that your point?
MR. NEELY:

Your Honor, I think that the question even

more precisely, if I may, is whether or not from the record in
this case, the entire
apparent.

record in this case,manifest necessity is

It is my contention that it is apparent from the

entire record in this case, and I believe that narrows

Your

Honor's positions somewhat.
QUESTION:

Well, is that true if there was some reason

in the record to think that the judge applied the wrong legal
standard?
MR. NEELY:

I think, Your Honor, that very probably

that question could go either way, depending upon the facts, but
I am inclined to think that the question of what the judge said
is far less important than the question of what the judge did
and what the circumstances dictated.

This Court has indicated

14
many times in the past its reluctance to characterize —
QUESTION:

Well, if the judge indicated that he didn't

think a finding of manifest necessity was necessary at all in
this case as he read the cases, and that all he had to do was to
find some possible prejudice —
MR. NEELY:

1 think it is very probably under that

circumstance an appellate court would be justified in saying
that there has not been an adequate consideration, he has failed
to completely —*
QUESTION:

Even though you might canvas the record

and find that there was manifest necessity.
MR. NEELY:

Had there been any real misconduct in the

Jorn case, I think it is very possible that the premise that you
stated could have applied there.
QUESTION:

To what extent, is a habeas court, if any,

obligated to give deference to a state trial court's findings or
implied findings on a subject such as this?
MR. NEELY:

I don't believe that that obligation ex™

tends or the extension of that obligation is any great factor.
It has always been.ray understanding, and I believe the law is
clear, that the state court is permitted, in fact perhaps re/

quired to go into the facts and the circumstances surrounding
the allegations of what was incorrect in the original proceed­
ings which would justify the granting of the writ.
QUESTION:

When you say

stato court, do you mean

15

federal court?
MR. NEELY;

I'm sorry, federal court.

I think in

following, the question first I think I would ask this Court to
resolve is the question of whether or not the findings them­
selves are necessarily controlling on the determination that is
made by the federal courts in reviewing the question of whether
habeas corpus should be granted in situations where a mistrial
has been granted without the defendant's consent.
I think the second question would be that, even if
the Court finds that that is not the case, there is still a re­
maining question here and that is whether the standard that was
applied by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in this matter on
reivew of the District Court's judgment was the correct
standard.
I think the standard that is implied at least by the
Court's past decisions with respect to cases and situations
wherein the mistrial is based upon a finding of misconduct or
improper conduct on the part of the defense attorney is somewhat
different than the standard that was applied by the court in the
Ninth Circuit.
ard.

The standard clearly there was the Jorn

stand­

I think the standard should have been the Somerville

standard.
I think that if we are lining up the question of
manifest necessity, the question of whether the ends of justice
will be defeated by the continuing of the proceeding, that

IS
one of the things that should be considered in terms of the ends
of justice is the fact that the state also has a right to pre­
sent its matesrial, its case to an impartial and fair jury.

I

think a situation where, for example, in this case, the Supreme
Court of the State of Arizona was improperly called as an
unsworn witness essentially to bolster the position of defense
counsel and the defense, that there clearly are subtle implica­
tions on a jury that can best be perceived by the trial court
that could very well result, and in fact probably would result
in the trial court3s attitude being prejudiced against the
state and against giving the state a fair hearing on its trial
of the case.
I think the additional references to the long time
that Mr. Washington has spent in prison, the references to the
prosecutor being removed from the case, I think all of those
references, taken in conjunction with the again attempt to call
upon the Supreme Court as unsworn witnesses to bolster the
defense position could very well have been found by the trial
judge unclear the circumstances to have compelled the granting of
a mistrial in this case and could almost not have been found to
moot the standard of the question of whether the ends of
justice necessitated the mistrial.

I think it is clear that

the possibility of prejudice is so strong here that it clearly
justified the finding of the trial court.
I would like to reserve some time for rebuttal.

17
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr, Neely.

Mr. Bolding,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ED BOLDING, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BOLDING:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court s
A few differences with my brother regarding the facts
of this case as pointed out originally by Mr. Neely:

Number

one, there was no short length of voir dire by the prosecutor
of this jury panel regarding their knowledge of the reasons for
a new trial.

The trial judge gave the prosecutor all of the

time that the prosecutor wanted to inquire into this jury
panel’s mind to see whether they, number one, knew the reasons
for the granting of the new trial? and, number two, whether that
would prejudice their position, their feelings in this case.
QUESTION:

Did

the defense counsel have any part in

that at all?
MR. BOLDING:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

It was both sides?

MR. BOLDINGs

Both sides, individual questioning by

the jurors outside of the presence of all of the jurors.

That

was fully inquired into, Your Honor,, at the request of the
prosecutor, incidentally.
Number two, the petitioner here, Your Honors, omits
the fact that the type of statement made by defense counsel in

18

this particular case was made in a context of varying statements
made by the prosecutor and by the defense counsel all through
the voir dire, all through the opening statements.
The prosecutor, over objection and with a motion for
mistrial following it, stated four years ago, there were other
proceedings, prior proceedings four years ago, would you as
jurors hold that against us, that some of these people might not
be able to remember things after four years, and we will have
transcripts of these prior proceedings.
QUESTIONS

Well, the jurors would sooner or later

find, if the transcripts were there, that a prior trial had
been held, would they not?
MR. BOLDINGs

Your Honor, in my opinion they knew

already but, yes, I believe that is correct.
QUESTION;

Is there any question about it at all, if

you bring in a transcript of a prior trial, that the jurors in
listening to that case are going to know that there was a prior
trial?
MR. BOLDING;

I think there is no question at all,

Your Honor.
QUESTION;

But you seem to be using that as a justifi­

cation fcr the conduct of the defense counsel that followed.
MR. BOLDING;

Your Honor, I do not use that as justi­

fication, that particular part of it as
fense counsel’s words.

justification for de­

19
QUESTIONS

Let me turn to one of the things said.

After the warning by the trial judge to desist, the statement
was made, "You will hear evidence that will show you that there
was another eyewitness," and then "You will hear evidence that
evidence was suppressed and hidden by the prosecutor, you will
hear that the evidence was purposefully withheld," and so forth.
MR. BOLDING:
QUESTIONS

Yes, Your Honor.

Well, how was the jury going to hear about

that?
MR. BOLDING:

From testimony from the witnesses, Your

Honor, from testimony of the witnesses.

The county attorney in

this particular case, not the present county attorney, Your
Honor —• the county attorney in. this particular case engaged in
a course of conduct which was specific misconduct as held by
the Supreme Court of Arizona, including —
QUESTION:

And the state paid its penalty for that by

having the new trial ordered.
MR. BOLDING:

Your Honor, that is part of the penalty

that they paid, yes, sir.
QUESTION:

Nov;, in what way would this evidence, these

items that I just read, that you will hear, how would that be
relevant evidence admissible?
MR. BOLDING:
for many reasons.

Yes, Your Honor, that would be admissible,

Number one, in Arizona, the law is a bit

different than many of the other states.

There is a broad scope

20

of cross-examination allowing impeachment, concerning bias,
prejudice, motive, interest of the prosecution in its witnesses»
Just like a defendant who goes out and tries to wire up a wit­
ness or tries to get someone to say something that is not true,
so can the state, so can the defendant prove that against the
state, Your Honor, we submit.
QUESTION;

Well, you are representing now to this

Court that under Arizona law that kind of evidence would have
been received so that the statements made by defense counsel
were correct statements, all of them were correct?
MR. BOLDING:

Yes, Your Honor, absolutely, and for

that —
QUESTION:

The Supreme Court did not think the same,

did they?
MR. BOLDING:
ruling in that area.

No, sir.

Your Honor, they did make the

They declined to accept jurisdiction of

the special action and on the habeas filing with the Arizona
Supreme Court it was denied without an opinion, so we don't know
what they thought.
QUESTION:

Well, the trial judge certainly didn't

agree with your reading of Arizona law.
MR. BOLDING:

No, Your Honor, evidently he didn't,

although I can't say that for sure.

We did not present to the

trial judge, because -- may I add this, there was a motion for
mistrial denied, absolutely denied; two witnesses presented,

21
then the next morning a rule 314 —• and Mr. Chief Justice, 1
must insert here that that rule was not in affect at that time,
rule 314, this was an old rules case, Arizona has new criminal
rules, this second case was begun after the new rules were in
effect but used the old rules.
unknown to

However, that old rule 314,

defense counsel at that time, was in two-thirds

part declared to be unconstitutional, so the trial judge gave
defense counsel 15 minutes the next morning to research the
area.

The Burruell case was not cited to the trial judge, and

I would like to quota shortly from State v. BurruelX, an
Arisona Supreme Court case, to show you what kind of things
would be conaiderad proper by tha Suprema Court.
The Supreme Court said this argument, this opening
statement was proper, a frame-up, ladies and gentlemen.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bolding, let me — you are certainly

free to go back to that, but I would like to ask you a question
first.

As you may imagine, there are presumably hundreds of

double jeopardy rulings by various courts throughout the coun­
try in any given year, and we don’t try to review all of them
oil the i r f ac t s.
MR. BOLDING:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

If the trial judge in this case, on pre­

cisely the record that there is here, had made a finding that
the jury, there was a probability of jury taint and the prose­
cution could not get a fair trial as a result of the defendant’s

22
examination and therefore it was manifestly necessary, citing
U.S. v. Perez, to grant a mistrial and empanel a new jury, do
you think you would still be entitled, to habeas corpus?
MR. BOLDING;

Yes, Your Honor, simply for the reason

that I think that does not go far enough and inquire into the
facts of the particular case, which is what the Ninth Circuit
held should be done in this particular case.
QUESTION;

But, Mr. Bolding, the Court of Appeals

didn’t reach this point at all.

The Court of Appeals didn't

look at the record to see if it would have supported any kind
of a finding of manifest necessity.
MR. BOLDING:

Your Honor, I'm sorry, it is my under-

standing that they did.
QUESTION;

Well, I thought they just said that the

District Court hadn't nuide the findings that were necessary and
set it aside.
MR. BOLDING:

I believe, Your Honor, that the Ninth

Circuit said, number one, vre would liked to have seen something
about manifest necessity or some kind of finding," number two,
we would like to have the trial court have considered soma
alternatives to just a declaration of mistrial; and, number
three, notwithstanding all of that — and in the concurring
opinion, Justice Marshall, the two members concurring, I think
that makes it probably the ruling that we look at,
don't know -

said we

QUESTION:

They carry it in one man’s name.

MR. BOLDING:

Yes, sir.

The two judges that were

there -QUESTION:

And the other two join.

MR. BOLDING:

Yes, sir.

The two judges in the eon-

curring opinion though said we don’t know what was in the trial
judge’s mind because here was a motion for mistrial denied,
then the prosecutor1 comas in with a new rule —
QUESTION:

Mr. Bolding, where did they go or. ard say

that if there had been a finding of manifest; necessity the
record would not have sustained it?
MR. BOLDING:

Your Honor, I believe they say in the

opinion that, based on the record, they can't tell whether the
judge relied on 314 -—
QUESTION:

That's different.

MR. BOLDING:
QUESTION:

All right, sir.

That's different.

MR. BOLDING:

All right.

X misunderstand you then,

and I perhaps
QUESTION:

Suppose the trial judge had said and

mouthed all of the right rule and made the findings, would you
think it would have been — the Court of Appeals did not say
the record would not have sustained that sort of an approach?

I believe that they stated, Your Honor,

that they wanted some basis for the ruling by the trial judge.

Exactly, they want the trial judge to do

They didn’t do it themselves.
MR. BOLDING:

They wanted — and. I believe they did

reflect -QUESTION;

I thought I had understood, perhaps I am

wrong, that the issue here was whether or not the Court of
appeals was correct in saying that the District Court erred in
not making findings and in stating the standard, the legal
standard, and if the Court of Appeals was wrong in making that
decision, we would simply tell the Court of Appeals that they
were wrong in doing that and they could go on and look at the
record themselves.
MR. BOLDING:
that.

Yes.

Your Honor, I would have to rescan

I believe that what you say may ba correct.

It was my

understanding that they did talk about the record.
QUESTION:

What is the rule that when a record is

silent, wholly silent as to the legal standard involved and the
findings, no express findings have been made, let's suppose the
rule is that a state judge at least, it will be presumed that
the state judge applied the right legal standards and made the
necessary findings in his own mind at least, although he didn't
write them down,

what if that were the rule?

MR. BOLDING;

Well, Your Honor, if that were tha rule,

then, that would effectively wipe out the right of the defendant

25
to hava an appellate review of that particular case.
QUESTIONS

No, it wouldn’t.

Then the Court of Appeals

would look at the record and see if the facts were sufficient
facts in the record to sustain the presumed finding.
MR. BOLDING:

Well, perhaps, sir, but I just feel

that that would effectively preclude appellate review, and the
appellate review in the Ninth Circuit did sustain Judge Walsh
at the District Court level.

Judge Walsh at the District Court

level did take a look specifically at the record -~
QUESTION:

But he was express in saying that he

thought the record would have supported a finding by the Superior
Court judge of manifest necessity but ruled that since there
hadn’t been any express finding, he was going to grant habeas.
MR. BOLDING:

Your Honor, I think a rereading perhaps

of what Judge Walsh said was that he would not have — in
essence he would not have declared a mistrial because he could
not see from the record that, it would have bean supported, how­
ever, he would also like some findings by the trial judge.

That

is what Judge Walsh said, in my opinion, sir, from reading that
opinion.
Your Honors, an example of what the Supreme Court of
Arizona says is proper — opening statements.

We will prove

that the county attorney’s office has knowledge of this
narcotics running.

We will prove this from officers of the

Pima County Sheriff’s Office and the City of Tucson Police

26

Department,

We will prove they investigated Mr. Lugo.

We

will prove that they presented a case to the county attorney's
office, one case will try to show is iron-cladd.
it right here in this courtroom.

We will try

We will show that the county

attorney's office refused to prosecute the state's witness.

We

will show that Mr. Lugo is under this ax, this ax of a criminal
charge being placed against him, putting him in jail, removing
him from his heroin.

We will show the interest of the state's

witness in testifying, as ycu will surely hear him testify
that he received a bonus„

We will show you that he went on the

payroll and, finally, when it is all over, we will prove to you
that the defendant was not guilty.
That is the type of opening statement that is specific­
ally approved by the Supreme Court of Arizona in State v.
Burruell.

And for those reasons and the reasons previously

stated, including, Your Honor, the opening of the door by the
prosecutor talking about: these prior proceedings, we say that
while the courts have held, and so it is a hard position for me
to argue

that this is not improper words, that these words

that were uttered were not improper at their termination, it is
a hard position for me to argue that, since the judges have
said the other way.

Still, the law is there.

We feel that the prosecutor opened the door by talk­
ing about these prior prosecutions, and this is one thing that
was emitted from the fact presentation here, of course.

Af ter the px*ior proceedings were mentioned, after the
trial was talked about, then the prosecutor also talked about
the fact that there was a preliminary hearing with a magistrate
who filed an information

and information filed based upon

the magistrate’s ruling.
Now, you are not hearing a claim before you today that
the words of the prosecutor at that particular time were im­
proper „
QUESTION:

But none of that is any of these opinions?

MR, BOLDING:

Yes, Your Honor, it is in the — it

might not be in the opinion itself, it is in the appendix re­
garding Judge Walsh’s, the District Court's ruling, in his
colloquy with the prosecutor at that time,
QUESTION;

But it is not in his opinion?

MR. BOLDING:
QUESTION:

No,

It is not in either one of the Court of

Appeals?
MR. BOLDING:

No, becuase that point was not taken

up on appeal in any manner.
QUESTION:

So why are you arguing it?

MR. BOLDING;

That opens the door, Your Honor, to the

defense counsel's last statements.
QUESTION:

Well, I don’t see how we can get. in that

door —
MR. BOLDING;

Well, sir

28

QUESTION:

— if no one else went in there.

MR. BOLDING:
that that is exactly

Well, it is our contention, Your Honor,
one of the reasons for allowing this

In other words, the prosecutor was, ac­

type of a statement.

cording to the finding by the Supreme Court, the Arizona Supreme
Court in its original opinion, a finding that the case should
be upheld by the trial court if there was misconduct of the
county attorney.

And that opinion, Your Honor, which you have,

states fully or semi-fully the facts upon which that conclusion
was based.
QUESTION:

Is that the memorandum?

MR. BOLDING:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, and that is —

Well, why do you call it an opinion if it

is a memorandum?
MR. BOLDING:

Well, Your Honor, under 48(c), rule

40(c), this is the law of the case.

It is a memorandum opinion

which may not be cited by another in another case at another
tinae, but this is specifically under 40(c).

It has a provision

saying that is the law of the case notwithstanding, and so that
is why we feel that we are entitled to cite it here. Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, did we grant to review these matters

you are talking about now or were they not washed out when a new
trial was granted?
MR. BOLDING:

Your Honor, I do not believe they were,

washed out when the new -trial was granted, because what wa are

29
getting at in part hare I thought was the fact that the county
attorney is saying, well, he had no right to say what he said
and that you therefore should take a look at it.
QUESTION;

I thought we were reviewing here whether

the misconduct of the defense was so gross that it warranted the
declaration of a mistrial, and that is the question before us,
and whether it was appropriately analysed.
MR. BOLDING:
rect.

Yes, Your Honor, I think that is cor™

We feel that the background is a part of the determina­

tion as to — because you have to take the defense counsel's
conduct in context as it happened during the trial, Your Honor,
QUESTION:

)

If you wish to use your limited time argu-

ing that, go right ahead.
MR. EOLDING:

Well, Your Honor, I mention that.

I

think that is an integral part of it and I think that that is
adequately covered in the brief also.
The evidence, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, that you
mentioned, could have come in regarding credibility of the wit­
nesses,

in particular the chief detective handling this case —

and it is cited on page 8 of our brief —■ talks about the fact
that there is ~~ in response to a question by defense counsel
at aiiother hearing — talks about the fact that there is a
number of times when I talked to you, Mr, Defense Counsel, when
I really don't tell you the truth.

This is the type of credi­

bility that we would be getting into with this testimony, and we

feel that Arizona law clearly allows us to go into that type of
testimony, Your Honor, and that type of statement in the voir
dire and in the opening.
QUESTION;

Mr. Bolding, one Arizona case that most

clearly supports your view that this testimony about the prose­
cution suppressing the evidence of the witness who saw the man
run away, that that would have been admissible as impeachment,
what is the strongest case you sve got for that proposition?
MR. BOLDING:
QUESTION;

Burruell.

Burruell?

MR. BOLDING;

Yes, Your Honor.

It is our contention, if it please the Court, that the
opinion of the Ninth Circuit accurately states what happened
here.

The opinion of the Ninth Circuit says we don’t really

know what happened, why the trial judge granted the mistrial.
It could have been because he, as shown in the concurring
opinion, it could have been because he recited this rule 314
which, as I stated before, in two of its sentences, two out of
its three sentences was held to be unconstitutional, and which
was not .in effect at that time, which was the old rule that was
in effect, for this case only.
However, we recognise upon research that it was in
effect at this particular time.

The Ninth Circuit says maybe

it is possible for the trial judge to have ruled that the remark
was error, therefore we have to have a mistrial, as it was for

31
the trial judge to have looked at the record, considered every­
thing, determined that there was a manifest necessity for a
mistrial, for a new trial.

The Ninth Circuit, we submit, Your

Honors, states the situation very accurately.
The Court of Appeals in this case, the Ninth Circuit,
used a totality of circumstances test, in which one of the fac­
tors considered was whether a finding of manifest necessity was
made or whether there was a consideration to the alternatives
to the mistrial.
The court expressly said it did not require the reci­
tation of these talesmanic words, manifest necessity, but said
that on review that their record reflected that the trial court
did not make any such finding and did not consider any alterna­
tives.
The court did not express that any impropriety by the
defense counsel was of a magnitude that it would prevent the
jury from arriving at a fair and impartial verdict.

And in the

concurring opinion, sir, it was stated that there was no ex­
plicit or implicit finding of manifest necessity.

It was stated

that a. greater part of the argument was devoted to whether the
defense counsel's remarks were improper and whether the Supreme
Court's decision could be brought to the jury's attention.
When the motion was first argued., the -~
QUESTIONs

Well, the conclusion of the Court of Appeals

was that it was just as likely that the Superior Court judge had

32

granted a motion for mistrial without finding manifest neces­
sity, it would necessarily follow then that the Superior Court
judge would have dismissed or granted a mistrial of the prose­
cution’s case for what it conceived to be misconduct of the
defense counsel in a situation which would not have permitted
retrial.

That is just an absurdity.
MR. BOLDINGs
QUESTIONS

I'm sorry?

Well, you say that the Ninth Circuit says

the Superior Court judge may not have found manifest necessity
or might not have thought there was manifest necessity.
MR. BOLDING;
QUESTION:

Yes.

Well, if that were the case, the Superior

Court judge would have granted the prosecutor's motion for a
mistrial based on defense conduct's claimed misconduct in such
circumstances that the case could never have been, brought again.
That just doesn’t make any sense in a rational system of juris­
prudence.
MR. BOLDING:

Well, Your Honor, it was granted only

without any additional matters being brought to the trial judge5
attention, only with the additional thought of this rule 314,
which says don't talk about the previosu conviction, in essence.
And that is when the mistrial was granted.
QUESTION:

Well, was the mistrial motion argued at all

was that it?
MR. BOLDING:

Yes.

33

QUESTION;

And did people talk about what the rules

were?
MR. BOLDING:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, to an extent.

Well, are you suggesting that the judge was

ignorant as to what the controlling standard for a mistrial was?
MR. BOLDING:

I think that this judge thought, Your

Honor, that because of rule 314, which says don't talk about
the previous conviction, because that was mentioned, that there­
fore there was error and therefore the mistrial was granted,
because he did previously say —
QUESTION s

You are suggesting that he was ignorant of

the controlling federal standard, is that it?
MR.. BOLDING:

Yes, sir.

I am saying that he previous­

ly stated that —
QUESTION:

So you think judges have to say what the

standard is in order to avoid being thought to be ignorant?
MR. BOLDING:
state is what the

No, sir.

No, sir.

All X want them to

on what basis they are granting the mis­

trial, why they are gi'anting the mistrial.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose you got up and argued and

said, "Judge, the only way you can grant this mistrial is if
i

you follow Pares," and the judge says, ”1 know that," and then
he just grants the motion for mistrial?
MR. BOLDING:

Well, it is a serious problem and one

that perhaps this Court could address, although we feel that

this is not the case in which a broad policy decision needs to
be made, because of the ruling of the Ninth Circuit, because
of rule 314 that the Ninth Circuit talked about»

And we still

feel that a good rule to follow and one which has bean talked
about by —
QUESTION :

Do you seriously think that we took this

case to pass on local rule 314 of the State of Arizona?
MR. BOLDING:
QUESTION:

No, sir,

No, sir, I don’t,

Suppose the judge had said, in granting

the motion for a mistrial, "I’m granting a mistrial because of
grossly unprofessional conduct of the defense counsel which has
tainted the minds of all the jurors to the point where there
can't be a fair trial," do you think that would be equated by
a reviewing court to a finding of manifest necessity?
MR, BOLDING:

Probably, if he went on that particular

point, it could well be., sir.
QUESTION:

Well, why do you think he granted it in

this trial?
MR. BOLDING:

I think he granted the mistrial because

of the mention of the granting of the former mistrial — the
new trial, I'm sorry, and because of rule 314 of the Arizona
rules.
QUESTION:

Well, even if rule 314 had never existed

on the books or had become obsolete, had been eliminated and
you had no rule, does not the law of Arizona permit the judge

35

to use sound judicial discretion to determine whet her or not
there has bean taint that would impair a fair trial?
MR. BOLDING:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Then why is the rule important one way or

the other?
MR. BOLDING:

Well, only because of the sequence of

events in which they happened, and that is the mistrial motion
denied, previous discussion about the admissibility of whether
the Supreme Court agreed that the new trial should be granted,
and then the granting of the mistrial after the rule was shown
to the judge.

It was that simple, Your Hcnor? and we submit

that —
QUESTION:

Is what you are saying, if the 31.4 rule

had never corae up, never been mentioned, there would have been
no mistrial?
MR. BOLDING:
QUESTION:

That's correct, sir.

And the inference being that there would

have been no mistrial because there had bean no finding of
manifest necessity?
MR. BOLDING:

Thera had not been thus far in the trial,

yes, Your Honor, I agree with that.
QUESTION:

And you say this, even though it was the

defense that made the first motion for a mistrial?
MR. BOLDING:

It was the defense that made the first

motion for a mistrial upon the prosecutor's improper remarks, we

3S
feel improper remarks* and an objection later on to the prosecutor's remarks about the magistrate and the preliminary hearing,

again an objection, again overruled.
QUESTION:

With all this wrangling and counter-

wrangling, couldn’t the judge have determined a fair trial just
could not be had, and doesn't that equate with a finding of
manifest necessity?
MR. BOLDING:
we don't know that.

He could have, sir, but we submit that

We don't know what he found.

We know only

the sequence of events, sir.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything fur­

ther , counsel?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN D. NEELY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL
MR. NEELY:

Just for a moment, Your Honor.

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
One thing I do want to make clear, particulary re­
flected. by a question by Mi". Justice Rehnquist, I did not take
the position that Judge Walsh would necessarily have stated or
found that the record supported the finding of the mistrial
position.

What I take is that Judge Walsh indicated that he

had read and reread, the record and that had there been a
specific finding, that would have basically settled it for him.
The implication that I read from that is that we

37

don't really know whether or not he agreed with the trial
judge's finding but that the basis for his granting the writ of
habeas corpus was purely and. simply that the trial judge didn't
say I find a manifest necessity.
I think that it is clear from arguments of counsel
and the answers to the questions that this case is one that
turns on the facts, but again I would suggest that the position
taken by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in this matter is
essentially that in ordinary circumstances questions are raised,
arguments are heard and findings are made, and that the only
thing that is missing in this case is the findings? and I think
that their position clearly is that if those findings had been
there, it would have been a different story, because they talk
about reluctantly dismissing.

And I think it is also clear

that the basic approach they used here was to say we decline to
imply from the impropriety committed by defense counsel that
this court made a specific finding of manifest necessity.

I

don’t believe that that is a fair standard to apply•against
trial judges.

I believe that there has to be, when you have

set out your standard as being an abuse of discretion on the
part of the trial judge, that there lias to be in addition to
the scrupulous exercise of discretion by the trial judge a
scrupulous exercise of the Appellate Court's review of the
record.

In essence, I think that the Appellate Court has to go

back to the record and has to determine whether or not the

38
trial judge’s position was or was not abuse of discretion.
Surely, if I carae up here as a defendant and said
there was abuse of discretion, you would not hear me; on the
other hand, to say as a prosecutor, well, there may have been
but there are findings here that specifically state that there
was a manifest necessity and that all the alternatives were
considered, and that is final on the issue.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, counsel.

The case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted:.]
