ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. WALSH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. WALSH:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court;
This is a death knell case.

The Court today, in

this natter, is being asked to decide the validity of the socalled death knell exception to the venerable final judgment
rule of Section 1291 of Title 8, United States Code.
The death knell doctrine was first formulated by the
Second Circuit in the original Risen case in 1966.
Simply stated, it permits an appeal by a class action
plaintiff from an order refusing to certify the case for class
action treatment if the plantiff can convince the Court of
Appeals that he would abandon his individual claim if he is
not permitted to represent the class.
Under those circumstances, the Court of Appeals in
Eisen deemed the refusal no certify to be a final judgment
because it sounded the so-called death knell of the case.
The purpose for -the death knell doctrine, as
originally conceived and as it has been applied, where it has

4
been applied, is not to create some special right, of action or
special right of appeal in a class action plai.nti.ff, as the
respondents in this case seem to, indicate»

Rather, the only

purpose for the death knell doctrine was to make sure that an
order refusing to certify a class action would not ultimataly
go unreviewed.

In other words, the question is, when the order

refusing to certify is issued, does that forever mean that this
matter will

not be maintained as a class action?

And I think it is important to bear that purpose of
the dsath knell doctrine in mind -through our discussion this
morning,
In the intervening twelve years since Risen JE, the
death knell doctrine frankly has not fared well.

Its validity

has repeatedly ben questioned by the Second Circuit itself,
including in particular Judge Henry Friendly, who has called for
its abolition, the doctrine has been rejected flatly by the
Third Circuit and the Seventh Circuit.

It has been applied in

modified form by the Fifth Circuit and in

very limited form

by the Ninth Circuit.
V7@ are here this; morning asking this Court to uphold
the j dgnsnt of the Third Circuit and the Seventh Circuit, to
reverse the judgment of the Eighth Circuit in the instant case,
and, if the Court will, to sound the death knell for the death
kne11 doctrine.
It might be appropriate and helpful at this point to

5
review in summary fashion the facts of -Hie instant case.
This is an action brought in 1973 under the Securities
Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The

complaint charged that a registration statement and a prospectus
issued by the co-petitioner, Punta Gorda Isles, Incorporated,
contained certain false statements.
Although the original complaint made class action
allegations, the plaintiffs themselves waited more than nine
months before they initially requested the court to certify a
class.

And even at that time they did not request a hearing

on that issue.
Eventually, some 18 months after the action was
originally filed, they finally requested a hearing, after being
promp ..ad to do so by the Court of Appeals.
A hearing was held promptly and within one month after
the final brief was filed by the parties on the class action
question, the district court in St. Louis certified the case
for cLass action treatment.

However, at the same time, th&

district: court issued an order to idle attorney for.'the class
action plaintiffs to show cause why they should not be enjoined
from representing the class.
that

And the background of that was

s (:-June out in the hearing on the class action question

that • ihcse attorneys who were representing the plaintiffs and
thus purported to represent th© class had in fact represented
one of the underwriters who was involved in the offering.

It

6

was on unrelated matters, but it. had had a continuing relation"
ship with that underwriter.

And their refusal to join the

underwriters as defendants in the lawsuit caused some questions
to core up about whether that judgment was a fair one or whether
it might have bean halted by a conflict of interest.
So, at the time that the trial judge certified the
matter for class action treatment, he also Issued an order to
shew cause to the attorney's why they should not be enjoined.
They chose not to contest that, and -hey withdrew from the
action, at which ‘him© present counsel for the respondents
appeared.
Immediately upon the appearance of new counsel, tee
trial judge inquired of them whether they intended to join the
underwriters in tee lawsuit.

In tee judge’s view at that time

it was still not clear whe the parties to this case were going
to be.
He was not given, an answer to teat question until
late In October of 1975, at which time it became clear to him
that the reason the underwriters had r.ot been joined was the
statute of limitations had undoubtedly run against them, while
initiicounsel for the respondents had been struggling to keep
the conflict of interest from coming to the court’s attention.
At teat time ~~
QUESTION;
could have been taken?

So there was a period when the action

7
MR. WALSH:
yes, Your honor.

Against, 'the underwriters?

I believe so,

At the outset, I think, at least a couple of

the theories of the respondents i.n their complaint, the under-**
writers could properly have been joined as defendants.
Upon coming to this realization in October of 1975,
the trial court —*
QUESTION;

Did they join all 'the members of the

underwriting syndicate except this one?
MR. WALSH;

Mo, Your Honor, none of the underwriters

joined.
QUESTION:
MR. WALSH:

Oh, non© were.
Nona of them were.

Tats pard.es were

Punfca Gorda Isles, the issuer, its officers and directors, and
Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting firm.
QUESTIONs What would be the theory of proceeding
against the underwriters?
MR. WALSH:

Well, it’s standard procedure in securities

cases, Your Honor, to join the underwriters.

Their liability

is virtually automatic if you establish the other elements of
liability under Section 11, for instance, of the "33 Act.
It's a fairly routine matter, thatthe trial court
just wanted to know why it wasn’t dcrr. , ,:,nd ;'never

die

get a satisfactory answer, and was caused to become concerned
that l-.r.-ro were othar reasons just than tha merits of the case —
QUESTION:

How tig a percentage of the offering did

8
the underwriter with respect to which the conf 1:‘ ch existed have?
MR, WALSH;

A small percentage, Your Honor, very

small.
In its October 13rd, 1975, order, the trial court
expressly said that, he was concerned about the adequacy of the
representation of the class that was being exhibited by these
respondents, and he directed at that time that a notice be sent
to th® class, advising him of what had happened to date in the
lawsuit, and spacifically .requesting petitions either for
intervention or for appointment of a new class representative»
Also at that time the court directed th<a respondents
to initiate discovery as to the names and addresses of the class
members for the purpose of sending this notice,

He had stayed

discovery up to that point on the merits, until tie class
action questions were finally resolved.
Again, however, the respondente did not comply with
the order, and in fact they waited more than six months even to
informally request the names and addresses of the class members,
and mor?s than nine months before they actually initiated the
discovery procedures under the rules,
At: that point a motion to decertify the class was
filed, and, on September 1, 1976, the court, exasperated with
the. behavior of the respondents and vitally concerned about
both their adequacy of representation and the delays that had
occurred, decertified the class and ordered that the respondents’

9
individual claims could proceed.
At that time the respondents did not ask for a
Section 1292(b) certification.

Instead they filed a notice of

appeal to the Eighth Circuit,, under Section 1291, and, in a
separate independent proceeding, they asked tha court to issue
a Writ of Mandamus against the decertification order»
The Eighth Circuit denied our motion to dismiss the
appeal and, after argument on the merits, held that the de­
certification order was appealable
doctrine.

under the dsath knell

It then ruled that the district court had erred in

decer tifying the case, and it ordered it recertified, without
any discussion of whether it should have been certified in the
first place»
In perm!tiling the appeal, tha Eighth Circuit took
not® of the fact that the respondente' individual claim

was

in the amount of $2650, ard that tie expenses of prosecuting
the action would exceed -that amount.

It therefore! held that

the death knell doctrine — the death kr»^17. c* th* curr hrf
sounded, and it denied the Mandamus petition as moot.
The primary question presented to this Court or.
certiorari deals with the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals
to entertain the appeal from the decertification order,
The secondary question presented in our petition is
that if jurisdiction is found to exist in the Court of Appeals,
did the Eighth Circuit overstep the permissible bounds of

10
judicial appellate review in substituting its judgment for
that of the district court»
I will confine my oral remarks primarily to the
first point, which I think is of most interest to the Court,
and I think the second point has bean adequately briefed, and
we rely principally on our briefs in that connection»
We submit that the death knell doctrine is an improper
reading of Section 1231 of Title 28»
Section 1291, of course, embodies th© final judgment
rule, which traces its roots back to the first Judiciary Act
of 1789.

It has bean described as the dominant rule of

federal appellate jurisdiction designed to prevent piece-meal
appeals and undue litigiousness.
In Cg.rro3.1 vs. United Statas, which is perhaps the
closest case in. its facts to the instant matter, the Court held
that a. judgment is final only if the termination of 'Idle action
is '1*2; necessary result of the order.

And it also held that

appeal ability cannot depend on th© facte of a given case.
Well, th© death knell doctrine, in our view,
violates these principles»

Th© order which decertified the

class in th© present case did not act in any way upon the

%
claim cl th© individual respondents.
a claim for $2650»

They came into court with

After the class action was certified, they

still had a claim for $26:50.
■

QUESTION:

In some court other than a federal court?

11
They need a li.tt.le over tea thousand for the federal court»
MR. WALSII:

No, this was under the Securities Act,

Your Honor, so they qualify without regard to amount in
controversy.
QUESTION:

That's right.

MR. WALSH:

After the action was decertified, they

still had a claim for $2650.
QUESTION: But no lawyers.
MR. WALSH:

Well, teat's not clear, either.

The

record that was made in the district court of course was not
made with a view toward determining whether the death knell
would eventually sound, and it never did

with few exceptions.

But the record does show in this case that the individual
respondent, Cecil Lives ay,, acknowledged in his deposition,
where he was asked, "Will you continue to proceed with this
case if it does not go foirw&rd on a class basis?"

He said,

"Well, I'll have to think about teat? I'll have to leave teat
d@cis.lon up to ray lawyer.

If my lawyer says yes, then, yes, I'll

proceed."
Well, hca personally didn't consider the claim to be
unviable, end it shows that the decision is really that of the
lawyer.

It's an economic decision by the lawyer, rather than

an order which acts upon i, claim.
did not act upon their claim.

The decerfci.ficr.tion order

It created a situation in which

the lawyer had to make a decision whether he? wanted to undertake

12
this claim under these facts at this time.
Furthermore, the respondents, in an earlier petition
for Mandamus to the Court of Appeals, had told the Court that
they intended to continue with the claim ©van if class
actios, certi fication was denied.

So there they ware trying

to get tee Court to act on the representation teat they did
intend to puruse the matter on an individualized basis.
And, in fact:, after the decertification order was issued by tee
Court of Appeals, they did continue.
Now, -they engaged in considerable discovery on -- at
a tiros when the only thing that was pending were their
individual claims.

And respondent Cecil Livesay, in opposition

to the certification order, filed an affidavit in which he
said,

do intend, I am committed to this case, and I do

intend to follow it up."
We think teat the death knell doctrine is a
judicially created exception to the finality requirement which,
in practice, primarily applies tc antitrust and iecurihies
laws clrims:, in which ordinarily it does not apply to such
cases as civil rights actions or diversity cases.
We think it ignores tee teachingas of this Court in
Baltimore; Contractors vs. Bodinger and Liberty Mutual vs. Wetzel,
which hold that the amendments to the finality requirement of
Section 1291 are really mutters for Congress, and that in that
area Section .1292 (b) has been created as the vehicle for review

13
of interlocutory orders, said that further judicial exceptions
to fch® finality requirement are unwarranted and unwise»
We think that there are a number of reasons,, most of
which are set forth in our brief at some length, why the death
knell doctrine is inadvisable, improper, and unwarranted»
Reason No. .1 has to do with the language of Rule 23
itself.

Rule 23, in its own terms, provides that any order

certifying or refusing to certify a class action is conditional,
and it. provides that it may be altered or amended at any time.
By definition, therefore, a class action determination is not
final.
Moreover, even if Rule 23 did not so provide, general
concepte of judicial husbandry reveal that the trial court has
continuing jurisdiction over prior orders and has the power to
amend them at any time prior to final disposition of the case.
QUESTIONj But the theory of the death knell is not
that the order of declining to certify rs not capable of being
changed by the trial court, but that if it is initially entered
it means the cs.se just won't be further prosecuted»
MR. WALSH;
QUESTION:
MR. WALSH:

It assumes that it will not.
Yes„
Yes;»

But ~

QUESTIO??: So thcs fact that the trial court might, if
prosecution continued, later change his mind doesn’t undermine
the b “.«.sis for the dp&th knell doctrine, I would think.

14
MR» WALSH:

Well, the death knell doctrine really is

designed to make sura that the — this determination that tils
matter shall never ba adjudicated on a class-wide basis is
somehow preserved for appellate review.
Now, the fact that til© individual plaintiff in a
case rosy not choose to go forward does not mean teat these
issues are forever resolved.

You have tee possibility of inter­

vention, you have the possibility of another class action being
filed,
And you have tecs possibility that if this plaintiff's
claim really is not abandoned —
QUESTION:

Wait a minute.

MR. WALSH:

— he, too, sooner or later will be able

to obtain class certification, maybe because someone else is
willing to come in and join as an intervenor.
QUESTION:

In this specific case, could another member

©f the class file a brand-new case?
MR. WALSH:
not.

Yes, Your Honor.

I see no reason v/hy

He could file -*•
QUESTION:

And have class action?

MR. WALSH:

He could certainly seek to maintain a

class action, yes.
QUESTION:

.No, - but could he maintain it, after

teis decision in this case?
MR. WALSH:

There would be no

res adjudicata problem

15

with it»

The basis for the —
QUESTION:

There’s no estoppel there?

MR* WALSH;

No, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

There’s no law of the case there?

HR. WALSH:

No, Your Honor.

The reason why this class action was decertified had
to do with the adequacy of -the class plaintiffs and with the
delay that they had caused.

If an adequate plan.tiff — an

adequate representative carae in and asked to be named 'the
class representative, we would still contend that the class
action is unmanageable and improper for other reasons, but
there are the same reasons that we raised before in this
proceed ng, but -there’s no res adjudicata problem with it,
or collateral estoppel, in my opinion.
QUESTION: Do you think the considerations are the same
with -rsripect to denial of class certification, as they are when
there’s been a certification and then a decertification?
MR. WALSH:
Justice White.

1 see no reason to differentiate, Hr.

These rules that have grown up around the death

knell doctrine have been applied in both instances, both
initial refusals to certify and ultimate decertifications.
It seems to me that ~~
QUESTION:

None of the cases upholding fcT e death

knell doctrine have distinguished between idle two?

MRo WALSH:
QUESTION:
MR. WALSH:

Yes, Your Honor»

Thera are at least two •

This one, for example.
Yes.

But in the ICorn and Ml lb erg cases

in the Second Circuit, one of those was a decertification as
distinguished from a refusal to certify.
QUESTION:

Well, until decerti.fication, though, the
i

lawsui.t was going forward, not only on behalf of the named
plaintiff, but on behalf of others.
MR. WALSH:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
And tiie decertifications terminated that

case on behalf of others.

There's no question about 'that, is

there?
MR. WALSH:

Well, it has terminated this case as a

class action, and to the extent that ~~
QUESTION:

Wall, it's terminated -- whatever this

case had to do with others has bean terminated.

It was going

forward on behalf of others, although unnamed in there.
MR. WALSH;

Yes, but not to their prejudice.

QUESTION:

Well, it isn't going forward never-^heless

it's been dismissed with respect to others.
MR. WALSH;
QUESTION:

Yes, that's correct.
In a way that it wouldn't have been had

the trial judge simply initially refused to certify a class.
MR. WALSH:

I think tiie result is the same as far as

the absent class members are concerned.

17
QUESTION:

Well, but ex coot where the trial judge

initially refuses to certify, there never has been a going
ahead with respect to class members,
MR. WALSH:

Well, the Court, has held, for instance,

for statute of limitation purposes, Shat it is a class action
until — from the time that it’s filed until an order is entered
refusing to certify.
QUESTION:

And that case is just that, they were

originally denied certification, weren't they?
MR. WALSH:

That's correct, You Honor.

And that's the way it's usually applied, but my
position is that it really doesn't make any difference.
QUESTION: Well, what if notice had gone out?
QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

You wouldn't think it would make any

difference, would you?
MR. WALSII:

Well, you have to send another notice

advising then that it had bean terminated, I would think, but
the result would be tele same.
QUESTION:

Yes.

In terms of finality it would be

the same result, even though notice had gone out?
i

MR. WALSII:

Yes.

It would not be appealable then,

Your Honor.
The second major problem with the death knell doctrine
we think, is that it. requires the appellate court to make a

18
determination of finality on a record that is ordinarily
unsuited to such a determination.

The record .that’s made before

the trial court on the question of whether the class action
should be certified does not address the issue of what will
happen if it's not certified.
Now, the Fifth Circuit has indicated that it will
only accept death knell appeals if that record does affirma­
tively show that in the absence of certi.fication there will Le
no further continuance.
But we think that, to the extent that the death knell
doctrine interjects the appellate into the fact-finding process,
in the first instance, it’s unwise and it’s unsound.

And

usually it requires the Court of Appeal «* to make a. guess as tr
the intentions of the counsel for the plaintiffs,
QUESTION: Well, if you were in the Fifth Circuit,
appearing before a district judge in the Fifth Circuit, would
you think that he was acting properly if he rejected an offer
of proof as to whether or not the action would yu forward, in
view of the Fifth Circuit’s holding?
MRo WALSH:

No, I think that: would be an appropriate

thing for him to inquire into and for you to produce if you're
the plaintiff.

In the Fifth Circuit you have the burden of

establishing that the death knell will sound if you are refused
class action.
QUESTION:

Then tile appellate court isn’t: engaged in

19

first -round fact-finding.
MR. WALSH:

That's right.

That's one way that the

burden of the death knell doctrine has been ameliorated somewhat
by one court.
We think -that except for that kind of a ruling that
the death knell doctrine does embody an inefficient use of
manpower because of the requirement that the appellate courts
try to comb through a record made for other purposes to make
an informed,, or perhaps uninformed, guess as to whether the
plain tiff's counsel deems this case ---■
QUESTION: Well# what if your class members had noti.ce
and you're perfectly happy# as a matter of fact# you're delighted
the casta is going forward on behalf of the class which
includes you# and then you're notified that the case is no
longa;' going forward on your behalf, it's been dismissed# and
you're going to have to spend your own money, I guess# if you
want to litigate.
I take it you would say that you couldn’t intervene
either# and appeal the denial# the decertification?

QUESTION:

Well, why could that person intervene then

and appeal?
MR. WALSH:

The appeal relates only ho the class

QUKSTION:

Well, I know, but the reason

you're

suggesting that ha could appeal because there's been a final
judgment.
MR. WALSH:

Oh, no, he can appeal only at such time

as there is a final judgment.
QUESTION:

Well, that's what I asked you, and you

said that a final didn't say ~~ hold that, did it?
MR. WALSH:

No,

QUESTION: Wall, what about the — it didn't hold that
the intervanor couldn't intervene earlier?
MR. WALSH:

He could intervene, certainly, but he

couldn't appeal.
QUESTION: Wall, why couldn't he appeal and say
"Thera's been a final judgment here; the case that was going
forward on my behalf has been dismissed"?
MR. WALSII:

Because the cas© has not been dismissed

in its entirety, the final judgment --QUESTION:

I know, but it has — his case has been

dismissed.
MRe WALSH: Well# it's not really his case.

QUEST!.ON:

MR. WALSH:

He got notice saying:

it's being prosecuted.
Now, until that case is disposed of —
QUESTION:

But he was notified too, as a class

MR. WALSH:

That’s right.

member.
But, Tour Honor, there1s

no final judgment in .any case until an order is entered
disposing of all parties and all issues, and the fact that
two or three plantiffs are dismissed out of a case, or all but
one, for instance, does not make it a final judgment.
QUESTION:

Well, they weren’t really dismissed,

either.
MR, WALSH:

Not in the final ~

QUESTION: Wall, Rule 54 at least requires -that there
be a finding by the court in such a case, doesn't it?
MR. WALSH:
delay.

That's correct.

No just reason for

Yes.
Our third quarrel with the dearth knell doctrine is

that it destroys the certainty and the predictability that

22
Section 1291 was designed to

achieve.

In some instances I can conceive that if the death
knell doctrine is adopted, a lawyer is required to file an
appeal in an interlocutory situation, just to make sure that
the order that was entered is not deemed to be final — later,
after the case is over, and therefore he's barred from appeal»
That was the Dickinson case some years ago.
I think it also spawned a considerable number of new
request:-', for exceptions to the fxna.1 judgment rule, producing
ei flood of interlocutory appeals which will overwhelm our
already over^burdened federal appellate courts.
QUESTION:

Has that happened since this decision?

MR. WALSH?

Well, certainly the number of appeals

has tripled since 1966, Your Honor.

How many of that are

attributable to the death knell doctrine, I can't tell.
QUESTION? Well, not many Circuits have the death
knell doctrine.

The Second and now the Eighth —

MR. WALSHi
QUaSTiO.'l:
MR. WALSH;

The Second and thcs Eighth.
and the Fifth in a modified form.
And the Ninth in an even more modified

form.
QUESTIONj

Well, has it increased in the Second

Circuit?
MR.WALSH:

QLx.STi.od:

I don't have any statistics on that.
Weir# how can you make the statement about

23

what's going to happen?
MR. WALSH:
QUESTION:

Well, certainly if -If it hasn't already happened, how can I

assume it will happen?
MR. WALSH:

If you permit any plaintiff who files a

class action and then is denied the right to represent the
class to file an interlocutory appeal, then you're going to
increase the* number of appeals filed, and you're also going
to increase the number of class actions that are filed,
I can't prove that, but that's what my senses tell m©,
I think also the logical corollary of the death knell
doctrine is that any time I could convince an appellate court
that I don't want to continue my case any further because it's
economically undesirable for me to continue in the wake of th©

appeal that order.

That's really what the death knell doctrine

says.

MR. WALSH:
question.

You mean an order denying summary judgment?
Anything.
Without any respect to class action?
Right.

Irrespective of the class action

Any time I can convince the court that that order

has effectively prevented me from wanting to continue my case
further, I ought to be able to appeal it, because that's the
exact rationale of to© death knell doctrine.

24
We think certainly, too, that the death knell doctrine,
as has been recognized by many courts, unfairly discriminates
against class action defendants and in favor of class acti.on
plaintiffs.

An order refusing to certify a class action is

immediately appealable under the death knell dr -rvr.
On the other hand, an order granting class certifica­
tion is not appealable.
QUESTION: Aren't there some Circuits that allow appeal
of orders granting class certification?
MR. WALSII:

The Second Circuit has experimented with

what they call the reverse death knell doctrine, and has applied
it in a couple of cases, and has later concluded that it really
isn't any more workable than the death knell doctrine itself.
And, although I think, in my own opinion, -that more
often than not the grant of class certification is the dea-sh
knell of tiie case than the refusal of the grant, because
experience shows us that mi overwhelming majority of these
class actions, particularly in the securi.ties area, ar© settled
and never tried, because of the in tsar rorem effect of the
grant of class certific&tion.
But, again, that calls for speculation, as does this
whole area.

And that's why this certainty that 1291 is broken

and has been denied.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELVYN I. WEISS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. WEISS;

We have already gone through four and a half years
of this litigation.
class treatment.

This is a relatively simple case for
It was brought on behalf of approximately

1800 direct purchases of securities pursuant to a prospectus.
Approximately a year after the prospectus was issued, Punts.
Gorda wrote down the earnings reported in the prospectus by
decreasing one year’s earnings to one-third of what was
reported and another year’s earnings to 60 percent of what was
reported.
In spite of those facts, most of -She time that has
been spent in this litigation has been exhaustively spent on
•the class question.
QUESTION; Well, that’s the only question here, isn’t
it?

HR. WEISS;

That’s correct, Your Honor, but I think

it’s important to sea the background so that we can determine
whether it was the death knell in the context of this case.

26
During three of the years the district court stayed
discovery on the merits-

There is presently a stay entered on

the district court's own motion of all proceedings.

An order

decertifying the action as a class action was entered three
years after the action was instituted.
QUESTIONs

The basis -—

But a part of that delay was your failure

to move on the class action point, wasn't it?
MR, WEISS:

That's not correct, Mr. Justice Marshall,

QUESTION:

Well, correct it.

MR. WEISS;

The court had already certified the

class after that purported delay occurred.
case long after that transpired.

We c'«me into tie

We were the second counsel

in the case.
QUESTION: Well, did that help delay it?
MR, WEISS:

No, it

didn't, Your Honor, not in my

view, because —
r

QUESTION:

You mean changing counsel doesn't delay

a case?
MR, WEISS:

No,

I'm saying that the nine montis at

the? beginning of the case., before the motion was mad©

for the

certification of the class, did not delay the action.

It's

not uncommon for the first nine months to be taken up with the
pleadings, joinder of issue, service of interrogatories, first
request:;: for production of document’s, and responses thereto,
The delay, as the Eighth Circuit pointed out, was

27

provoked almost entirely by -the actions of the district court
judge and the defendants in their defensive tactics.
QUESTION: But tile activities you describe, counsel,
as typically taking up the first nine months, discovery,
interrogatories, that sort of thing, are themselves quite
expensive and time-consuming, aren’t they?
MR. WEISS:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION: And yet you do that without, any knowledge
that you will succeed in having your class certified.
MR. WEISS:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION: So doesn’t that take something away frcm
your death knell claim?
MR. WEISS;

Not. really, Your Honor, because we hope

that the class issue will be early determined.

The Rule, in

fact, requires that it be determined as soon as practicable.
If a litigant starts an action such as this, he
has to assume that the court is going to adhere to th© Rule,
and lx-6. Mid I think in El son there was son© urging that that be
done quickly.
So w© have to assume that the^y things are going to
occur quickly.

But the out-of-pocket expenses incurred during

that part of th© case are certainly a lot less than were
actually incurred after two and a half more years of litigation.
And that changes th© circumstances in this case.
" will try to fashion a standard for death knell as

f

28
I proceed in ray argument;, that I -think, makes some sense, and
might be applicable on a standard basis throughout the courts»
One of the problems I have with the death knell
doctrina is that ifc!s very difficult to decide what exactly it
is»

Some courts say ?7Q is what it requiras, and others say

$7500 isn't tbs death knell? and we have to find out really what:
the standard should be if it's going to work,
QUESTION:

That's partly because of no record,

isn't it?
MR» WEISS; Well, no, I will demonstrate, I hope, that
on this record in this car.® we have enough to apply the
standard that I will ^suggest»
QUESTION:

Well, conceptually, there’s a difference

of opinion>&oufc the death knell doctrine, too, isn’t there?
On© view being that it is a final judgment, as a practical
matter? end the other view being that it’s not a final judgment,
but, nonetheless, it’s appealable because of -die peculiar
©quitisr of the situation.
MR» WEISS: And soma read it as part of the collateral
ordar doctrine»
QUESTION:

Right;.

Yes»

MR. WEISS:

Some cases merge the two concepte, and

other separate them»

I think they fall into both, and think

it is final, as a practical matter, I think it also fits
well within the collateral order doctrine.

29
And I hope to demonstrate 'that: this particular case,
in this particular case the Gillespie doctrine is sufficient
support to sustain the Eighth Circuit's finding, irrespective
of whether or not the death knell doctrine is accepted by this
Court as a viable doctrine»
What happened was that the district court decertified
the class using a standard that is not mentioned in Rule 23»
H© decertified on the grounds that the actions of plaintiff's
counsel had caused a delay in the litigation, thereby taking
away rights from the defendants to a speedy trial»
The record indicates that the only delay that was
involved in that particular aspect of the case was approxi­
mately three months where there was a dispute between counsel
over fch<a production of trimsfer records»
a letter received from Punta

We had relied upon

Gorda's counsel in August 1975

promising to deliver the 'transfer records.

At our request,

after t' ?. judge fashioned an order which took something like
four norths for us to get after we submit-bad suggested forms,
we calls x: counsel for Punta. Gorda and they refused to produce
these documents.
The record at the hearing on the notion for class
certification also indicated that those records were readily
available .to counsel for Punta Gorda.
We argued with them telephonecally about this issue,
and then, we sought the assistance of the court by asking for a

30
conference on this issue»

When we got to that conference, we

were met with a. motion by defendant Coopers & Lybrand to
decertify -the class, but they didn't prosecute»
Three years after the litigation was commenced, and
after an enormous amount of work was performed by both sides,
it was a shocking types of a motion to me, and frankly X gave
it little credence at the time»

I guess I should have treated

it with more seriousness, because the judge granted it»
We did put in papers i.n response» We also had motions
requests for production then pending» There was a stay on
discovery at; the time»
Sc there w© were with a respondent — with clients
whose losses were approximately $2650»

They had already been

required to incur substantial out-of-pocket costs, and they
had nrt e.s yet fcuken their first deposition of a defendant in
the case, nor were they able to receive the first document
in discovery from defendant Coopers & Lybrand.

It is clear from the record that even if respondents
succeeded in winning their case on the merits at the trial,

requirements to complete the litigation on the merits»
Now, on© of the problems with the death knell, as I
stated before, is:

What standard do we, apply in these

situations?
And I suggest to Your Honors that the standard should
h© this:

If a plaintiff in this kind of a case, having won on

the merits on an individual claim, could not recoup the out-ofpocket expenses incurred by him during the prosecution of the
action, it makes no economic sense for him to proceed»
And we*re not talking about legal fees.

The only reason we started this action is because

out on behalf of the class."
It makes no economic sens© to bring a $2650 action,
where, if you personally get a judgment at the end for that
amount, with the taxable costs, you cannot recover the $15,000.
It only makes sense if you can be a class representative and be

assured that; after recovery on the merits you will be reimbursed
for those expensasc
QUESTION: Ar© you suggesting that taxable costs
would be a great deal more if filers were a class certification
than if ‘there were not?
HR. WEISS:

No, but typically, Your Honor, whan a

recovery is mad© on a class basis, all of the out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with the prosecution of the
action are reimbursed to file party off the ~
QUESTION:

Out of the funds recovered.

HR. WEISS:
QUESTION:

Out of the funds recovered.
Not from til© defendants separate and apart

from their liability for the judgment.
MR. WEISS; Exactly.

Out of the funds recovered.

So here Chief Livesay is confronted with a situation
where it would be impossible, if he continued this action and
triad his case on the merits and won, for him to recover, to
recoup these expenses.
QUESTION:

That's —

Mr. Weiss, —

MR. WEISS:

Yes.

QUESTION:

— to what extent is the possible inter­

vention of people with more at stake relevant?

be cured by getting a new party in, with a little more
financial resources, and maybe not have the deficiency that the

MR, WEISSs Well, how would we go about doing that,
Your Honor?
QUESTION: Well, wasn't there testimony that the
original counsel represented a lot of people who had bought
some of tills stock, and who knew about the action, might have

I think he's proven that he

He has diligently s-^ood behind us throughout this hectic

litigation for four and a half years.

Indeed, I spoke to him

Why should he have to go out and seek somebody else?
He has rights personally under Rule 23.

His right is to bring

ci©c©rrfilying the class, wrth him as the class standard-bearer,
why should he have to go out and search for somebody else?
QUaST-tON: But that's true in the case of any plaintiff
or any defendant who feels the district court has made an
erroneous ruling against him.

He has a right which may have

been infringed.

was not a right, it was a procedure by which, where the class
was too numerous to name, they could be brought in»

It. didn’t —

Do you agree with that?

MR. WEISS:

No, I don't say it gives him substantive

the framers of Rule 23 suggest that this is an important right
that they wanted to give to small claims holders.
QUESTION:

Well, your

argument suggests that Rule

MR. WEISS:

No, I'm saying that Rule 23 has to be

of a recognition that without Rule 23 you could not bring it.

QUESTION: What was it?
MR, WEISS:

First of all# there had been four

Circuit£* that had adopted the death knell doctrine at -that
point.

We thought therefore we had an absolute right to

appeal# so we filed a notice of appeal.

We don't think a

discretionary right, is equal to an absolute right.
Secondly# we felt we had a mandamus situation# and
we filed a Petition for Mandamus in the Circuit Court,

We

felt it would be inconsistent to go to a district court judge
from whose decisions we were seeking mandamus for abuse of
discretion# asking him to exercise his discretion in our favor,
I think as a practical matter that's a good reason.
Thirdly# in the hearings on the class motion# the
district court judge himself stated that he wanted to make a
record because the plaintiff would have a right to go up under
death knell.

So w© read that to mean that he# himself# accepted

the death knell doctrine sa a viable way to appeal this case#
or an avenue open to us.

41
QUESTION:

Did you have any doubt that: if you had

wanted to go the interlocutory appeal routs, that 1292(b)
covered an appeal from a decertification notice?
MR. WEISS;

Your Honor, there is some doubt on that

question, because the courts differ on what type of order can
be appealed under 1292(b).
QUESTION;

Well, there's a requirement that may

materially advance the ultimate termination of litigation -but that’s already terminated, isn't it?
MR0 WEISS:

It had already been terminated.

And, two,

what is the controlling question of law?
Now, I think in this can© w@ had it, except that it
had already terminated? by the controlling question of law
issue, I think we had it, because w© felt that 'the judge
decertified the class on criteria outside of Rule 23, which was
a peculiar circumstance, iand we felt that this was a broader
question than just this questions that arose in the litigation.
We didn't proceed in that fashion for the reasons I
stated before.
QUESTION:

Even though, independently of any

reservations whether you could?
MR. WEISS;
QUESTION;

That’s right.
Yes.

MR. WEISS; And of course Rul^ 54(b) is also a
discretionary rule, and wo had the aam© reasons for not seeking

42
the discretionary Rule 54(b) treatment.
QUESTIONS Bat if you don't get* the favorable exercise

So it was inconsistent

with our belief that the death knell doctrine gave us an

They ruled that the

Now, wa refute ihe petitioner's contention that if
this Court does accept — does not. accept the death knell as
meeting the requirements of Section 1291, or the collateral
order doctrine exception, that this Court does not have the
power to remand this case to ths Eighth Cir-ruf

Moore, 9 Moore Federal Practice, paragraph 110.213 of

forth in. the rule for mandamus -— that's Rula 21 of the Rules
of Appellate Procedure -*• should be followed.

The Courts of

Appeals can and frequently do treat a notice of appeal as a
petition for mandamus, if the order sought to be reviewed is
not applicable but the question presented is subject to review
by mandamus„
So the court had the power to treat the 1291 appeal,
even if found that it wasn't an appropriate appeal remedy.
As a mandamus petition. And, as such, this case — we are now
reviewing that decision, and we say that the Eighth Circuit can
again take tie mandamus petition and

QUESTION;

Wei.'., do you go that far?

You don't gc

that far, do you?
MR, WEISS;

No, I don't say that there should be an

interlocutory appeal from every order, but in a situation when
there is conduct at the district court level that is appropriate
for a mandamus, I think that the right of the parties clearly
should be able to go up or the mandamus petition. The Eighth
Circuit didn't decide it as moot, because it had decided in
our favor under 1291,

understand perfectly what you say about your client’s interest,
but we took the case to decide whether there is such a thing
as the death knell doctrine. And if we decide it on the
Gillespie basis, we deci.de nothing except that your case can
proceed,
HR, WEISS:

Well, I have clients here, and they are

my first concern, although I specialize in class action
litigation,

I have to tell you that the doctrine itself is

less important to me than these people,
QUESTION: Wall, you're pursuing your
should pursue,

the ends you

I'm just saying that it may not persuade all

of us who have a somewhat different point of view.
MR» WEISS:

Well, Your Honor, itaB possible that

46

Your Honors don't: accept: the death knell doctrine, and so
state, but at the same time you sustain my position in this
case, or in. effect affirm the Eighth Circuit's decision»
I think ~~ what I’d like to also point out is that
Mr» Justice Marshall this morning made a point, what will happen
in these death knell situations, will it flood -the appellate
courts ?
I respectfully suggest that I don't think it will»
In all the years that I've been in practice, and I have a rather
large firm specializing in this field, this is the first time
that we sought a death knell type of appeal»
We don't normally seek it» We think that th© final
decision rule is a sound one, and we try to prevent clogging
the courts»

There are exceptional circumstances from 'time to

time, and we think this case is one of them»
QUESTIONS And you promise us that if we grant in your
favor, in the future you won’t bring it again?
[Laughter. ]
QUESTION;

Unless you do it in that form, I'm

unimpressed„
MR» WEISSs

But. Your Honor, you know, the defendants

there's a great risk to tie plaintiff in that situation,
because the Circuit Court can indeed rule for the defendants
and put; an end to the litigation»

And not only put an end to

this litigation, but put fin end to any other case that might

47

seek similar relief as a class where there’s a, quote, "better
representative of the class", unquota»
Thank you, Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Walsh, you have two minutes,
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. WALSHf ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. WALSH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I just have a couple brief points to make.
The first, as Mr. Justice Stevens has indicated, the
death knell doctrine does encourage litigation by class action
representatives who have the least at stakes as w»* ve pointed
out hare, this claim by these respondents was some $2650,
yet; the record shows that the counsel that originally file:!
that claim in their behalf also represented on© claimant who
had a half a million dollar loss, another claimant who had
$140,000 loss, who was a neighbor of his, who he had known for
25 years and who he described as a millionaire.
Now, I suggest that it5s a fair inference ~~
QUESTION:

But, Mr. Walsh, what’s your response to

counsel's point ‘that it would have been unethical for him to
call up those people and say, ’’Would you like me to represent
you”?
MR. WALSH;

Your Hon or, tlie district court, in its

October 23, 1975 order, suggested and ordered that a notice go

4

48

out to the class members, sugge.sti.nq that they apply for
appointment as class representative, and that problem was solved
in that manner»
QUESTION:
MR. WALSII:

You mean that such a notice did go out?
Well, it was proposed to go out at the

time that the class action was decertified.
QUESTION: Then it did not go out?
MR. WALSII:
QUESTION:

It did not go out.
So 'then how does that respond to his

concern?
MR. WALSII:

Well, if there had been cooperation by

the respondents in 'the preparation and dissemination of that
notice, it would have gone out. Your Honor. That's what the
trial court was trying to do, to get a class representative who
could finance it and who was adequate.
QUESTION: Well, Mr. Walsh, how long would a millionaire
be a millionaire if he paid $15,000 to collect $2600?
MR. WALSII:
QUESTION:

Well, this particular claim —•
Si::?

How long would it be?

If he

consistently spent $15,000 to get $2600?

MR. WALSH:

Not very long.

That's true.

QUESTION:

Mr. Walsh, I think you said in your

original argument that you felt a 1292(b) appeal was available
here»

Are you convinced of that?
MR» WALSH:

No, I said that it is a viable alternative

in some matters, but, I would not talc© -QUESTION:

Well, wouldn't you have soma problems with

the —
MR» WALSH:

We would oppose it; in this case, Your

Honor? y©s, sir, we would.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. WALSH:

I think you would.

It is not a cure-all, but I think in the

Liberty Mutual case —
QUESTION:

No, but I mean within the text of the

requirements in the 1292(b) itself, wouldn't you have problems?
MR. WALSH:

In this cas© I would, Your Honor»

And in a lot of class action denials it might b© appropriate?
in others it might not.
QUESTION:

Well, how about mandamus?

If you prevail

on finality.
MR. WALSH:

Your HOnor, they have not cross-petitioned

from —
QUESTION; Wall, I know that, but what about the cases
— say, are there any cases sustaining the mandamus in this
situation?
MR. WALSH:

Not

there's only one mandamus case

50
in the class action context that I'm aware of, it’s in the
Ninth Circuit, where it ordered the district judge to
decertify a class that he had certified*

I know of no other

cases ordering the court to certify the class under mandamus.
QUESTION:

Mr. Walsh,

suppose this went to trial on

the merits and they got a verdict, for the named plaintiff of
$2650

period.

How is he going to get an appeal on a

decertification order in that circumstance?
MR. WALSH:

he wins»

Your Honor, he's entitled to appeal

under those circumstances, because he is not —
QUESTION:
MR. WALSH:

At that time?
Yes, Your Honor.

That's our position.

X think United Airlines v. McEon&ll so o*;ntemplates,
because the rationale the:c® was that 'the other stewardess who
was the bystander had the right to assume that —

which he wins.

Yes, -the assumption
No intervener comes in her®.
Th«, assumption that jus Lilted hhe

timeliness holding as to the intervener was that she could
expect the class representative, the named plaintiff, to appeal

Well, at least up to the ti.me that she

Yes.

won.

And Judge St&Lfcs in his concurring opinion in tie
Gardner case, which is the? next case you will hear, also
reasoned that if the named plaintiff goes through his or her
case and does win, he still has the right to appeal prior to
denial of class certification.
QUESTION: And what relief dess he get?

If ho wins.

MR. WALSH: Well? I’m assuming that when the case goes
up there’s going to be appeal both on his individual claim and
on th© class claim,,
QUESTION: That wasn’t the question, though.

The

question was, could he appeal the class action point?
MR. WALSH:

Yes0

Well, he ~

And then the court, says, "Yes, you cart

have the class action", and you go back and you try the case

MR. WALSH:

I don’t think you try it as to his

That would be the law of the case.

QUESTION: Well, how could you — what would happen?
MR.» WALSH;

Well., as I see it, if the only question

on appeal was the denial of th.© class certification and that
was reversed, th© case would go back to th© trial court and
the class issues would be adjudicated, and the claim of “the
individual plaintiff would no longer:

QUESTION;

Then you run into a real old case called

Hansbar/ry v. Lea, which says you just can't do that.
MR. WALSH;

Well, I think the 1966 amendments to

Rule 23 were designed to overcome the obstacles of Hansbarry v,
Lee, and they say you can do that now.
That would be my position.
QUESTION;

Mr. Walsh, as I understood my brother

Brennan's earlier question to you about 1292(b), it was whether
a refusal to certify a class action or an order, as in this
case, dcjcerfcifying a class could ever fall within the definitive
language of 1292(b), which requires a controlling question of
law and that an appeal may materially advance the ultimata
deteridn&tion of the litigation.
I think that was his question.

In any event, it's

mine.
MR. WALSH:
QUESTION;

Yes,, sir.
Isn't it arguable that no such order could

ever fall — even be eligible for consideration, for discretion­
ary consideration under 1292(b)?
MR. WALSH:

Well, it has been used,, 1292 has been

used in a number of cases.
QUESTION:

Well, what's your position?

You concede

QUESTION:

In , some cases I would have --

my Circuit ever faced that question

that you know of?
Yijs t we've cited cases in our brief.

HR, WALSH;
QUESTION;

You mean that squarely faced it?

MR. WALSH;

Yes .

QUESTION s

In some cases it could be used, to appeal

refusal to certify?
MR. WALSH;

Yes, sir.

It has been used# and I can't put my finger on it
right —
QUESTION; Well, don’t bother, if it's in the brief.
MR. WALSH;

Itfs in the brief.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
