ORAL ARGUMENT OB' GEORGE W. LIND BERG, ESQ.,
ON I3EIIALP OP PETITIONERS, ARTHUR P. QUERN, ETC.
MR. LINDBSRG:
the Court:

i represent

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
the Illinois State defendants in this

cause and I intend to argue for approximately fifteen minutes.
I will argue the position that Illinois can maintain
a special assistance program for emergency needs under its
regular AFPC special needs program.

Mr. Keith Jones, the Deputy

Solicitor General, represents the Secretary of Health, Education
and Welfare, also a defendant in this case.

He will argue the

balance of the: time and specifically address the subjects of
the basic statutory scheme underlying the AFDC and emergency
assistance programs.

He will distinguish the two programs one

from the other and he will argue why the Social Security Act
does not impose mandatory eligibility requirements on the state
in that regard, and he will establish why after the 1 landley
decision in this case, the first Mandley decision, the case
became moot.
This case arose whan the plaintiffs filed a complaint
alleging

that the Illinois emergency assistance program

5
violated, section 606 (e) of the Social Security Act under which
Illinois operated the program.

The Illinois plan for emergency

plan for emergency assistance covered essentially four kinds of
emergency needs for AFDC eligible individuals:

homeless due to

damage of the structure, homeless due to partial damage of the
structure, and the court-ordered evictions except for the non­
payment of rent, and there was a provision for AFDC applicants
who have not yet obtained eligibility or have been established
eligible

that they could have food, clothing, household goods

and equ ipitient.
The plaintiffs* allegations in attacking the plan
allege that the Illinois emergency assistance program as then
operated did not address the emergency needs of all destitute
children.

The plaintiffs in the case, the individuals were

persons who had applied for and been denied emergency assistance
in that their particular need was not one of those met by the
criterion that I mentioned a few moments ago.
These attacks were all principally made in count one
of the complaint.

Count two then went on to address allega­

tions that the Illinois plan violated the Fourteenth Amendment
of the Constitution, the Equal Protection Clause, because it
did not provide emergency assistance to all persons facing
destitution.
The District Court found for the state defendants
and for the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.

That

6

is, he did not find a violation of tha supremacy clause and he
did in fact find that the Illinois plan under 606(e) did not
violate 605(e) of the Social Security Act.
The plaintiffs appealed to the Seventh Circuit Court
of Appeals, which reversed the District Court and. found that
the Illinois plan more nearrowly defined eligibility than is
permitted in the court's opinion under 606(e) of the Social
Security Act.

This has been referred to as the Mandley I de­

cision because there is a second appeal which I will address in
a moment.
The case was remanded to the District Court for fur­
ther proceedings consistent with the court's holding.

The

defendants then made a. motion to dismiss the case as moot for
the reason that the State of Illinois had withdrawn its emer­
gency assistance program under section 606(e) and instead opted
to operate an emergency needs program under the regular APDCspecial needs program.
The plaintiff's* answer to that motion said that
Illinois was continuing to operate its emergency assistance
program and not under section 606(e) but under section 402.
And of courser it is correct that they were, Illinois was oper­
ating a program of emergency assistance under its APDC pro­
visions.
The District Court offered tha plaintiffs ample oppor
tunity to amend its complaint and address the new program under

7
section 402 of the Social Security Act.

The plaintiffs refused

to amend its complaint and some months later the District Court
granted the defendants' motion and dismissed the case as moot.
The plaintiffs again appealed to the Seventh Circuit and the
Court of Appeals again, having a second opportunity at this
case, concluded that the District Court erred, the case was not
moot, and, most importantly, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals
found that 606(e) is now the exclusive channel, statutory
charnel to receive federal reimbursement for the operation of
an emergency assistance program.
Again, the decision was sent to the District Court and
the court entered an order that was offered.

The state and the

Secretary filed a petition for a writ of certiorari which was
granted..
The result of the second Seventh Circuit holding in
Mandley II is that states now can only look to section 60S(e) of
the Social Security Act to operate an emergency assistance pro­
gram for needy children.
It is the position of the State of Illinois that
there is no support anywhere in the Act, in the legislative
history, in the administrative interpretation of the decisions
of the Act or the decisions of this Court that support the hold­
ing of the Seventh Circuit, and in fact what is available sug­
gests just the opposite conclusion, that 606 is not the exclu­
sive mechanism for the operation of emergency assistance program.

e
The Social Security Act establishes the basic frame­
work supporting the operation of the AFDC programs by the
states, and the regulations of the Secretary perhaps as far back
as 1949 recognize and authorize a special needs program under
\

the conventional AFDC program operated by the states.

Specific­

ally, I would draw the Court’s attention to section 233.20 of
the Code of Federal Regulations, if you will look in the yellow
copy, which is the original brief of the state petitioners, on
&$>,

you will see the language, quoting, this is 233.20(a) (2) (v) ;
”l£ the State agency includes special need items
in its standard,

(a) describe those that will be

recognised, and the circumstances under which they
will be included, and

(b) provide that they will be

considered in the need determination for all appli­
cants and recipients requiring them."
Now, this is the Secretary's acknowledgement that
special need items are permissible under the regular AFDC pro­
gram, and it is the position of the State of Illinois that for
many years emergency needs, non-redeearring needs of AFDC re­
cipients have been in fact met under that provision of special
needs, and it has been, of course, as I have indicated, regograized by the Secretary.

What I am asking is is there anything

anywhere defining "special need items5’ except the definition of

MR. LINDBERG:

To cover or at least to include the emer­

MR. LINDBERG:

there are special nas frotu time to time.

history has been that these payments do include the same pay­

MR. LINDBERG;

That is correct.

MR„ LINDBERG;

Yes, I understand that there are 27

That’s correct.

So that your point, is that it did expressly

MR. LINDBERG;

Wall, my point is that there is a

Secretary’s regulation indicating that it is legal, regular
authorised for an AFDC program to have a special needs provision,
The next step then, I presume, ana Justice Stewart’s question is

11
does special needs include emerge. cy assistance, too, and, of
course, our position is that it does because there was nothing
in the 1968 amendment which gave rise to 606(e) as a new pro­
gram to include a new class of people whose emergency needs
could be met immediately.

There was nothing in that language

that rejected what the Secretary had been doing and approving
all these years of what other states had been doing.
Now, I cite that section only to indicate that special
needs arts recognized by the Secretary.
QUESTION:

But the question — perhaps I . am repeating

what Justice Stewart asked, but I want to be sure I follow it.
The question that 1 wasn't sure of is how much of what the
states had previously been doing . although it was special,
could properly be classified as emergency?

And how do wa know

how much there was of that character?

I suppose the inference

Mr. Justice

Stewart may ha.ve been drawing is that since Congress

thought

that we needed another statute to deal with this orcolera, that
perhaps it is reasonable to infer that it was not adequately
dealt with before.
MR, LINDTERG;

well, I think in part that is part of

12
the rationale of Congress.

First of all, they were concerned

that, there are needy children out there who have not already
been prequalified for AFDCf but they have a need today, tonight*
so they authorised this new program in 1968, saying regardless
of AFDC eligibility, for one time a year, in other words they
had some fiscal concerns, once a year you can meet the needs of
a needy child without worrying about whether he is AFDC quali£ ied.
QUESTIONs

For not longer than 30 days.

MR. LINDBERG:
year.

For not longer than 30 days in one

And that was the objective of that provision.

Congress

obviously wanted to go beyond what was already being done, and
we have no argument w: eh that..

Our position is that both pro-

grams coexist.
QUESTIONWell, the question which has aroused by
Brother Stevens interest as well as my own is whether or not
special need items which you tell us is nowhere defined includes
*

the very specific definitional emergency assistance appearing
in 606(e)(i) and reproduced on page A6 of the appendix to your
brief, the term "emergency assistance to needy families with
children" means any of the following, furnished for a period of
not in excess of 30 days in any 12-month period* and so on,
which is very, very specific, and it does deal with emergencies
which, as I say, doesn't translate freely into special need
items.

MR. LIEDBERG:
is a difficulty.

Well, very honestly, Mr. Justice, that

We can search the statutes backward and for­

ward and just cannot find that type of support, nor is there
any evidence to the contrary.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEITH A. JONES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER, JOSEPH A. CALIFANO
MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the.

Court:
The Solicitor General authorized the filing of a pe­
tition for writ of certiorari in this case on behalf of the
Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, because it was
believed that the decisions below are counterproductive in
terms of the legislative purpose of encouraging emergency
assistance and also in terms of the interests of the very wel­
fare recipients whom the Court of Appeals thought it was
assisting.
The legal implications of the decision below are that
the federal government may no longer reimburse statement payments
of AFDC emergency assistance; second, that states that wished
to make federally reimbursable .payments to AFDC recipients in
order to alleviate the hardship that may result from emergen­
cies must do so not under an AFDC plan but under an EA plan;
and, third, that all state EA plans, whether newly created or
all needy families with

14
children.

They can’t, just carve out certain groups who would

be eligible.

And they must provide need not in just certain

enumerated emergencies but in all circumstances entailing the
risk of destitution.
The foreseeable practical consequence in the impli­
cation of this decision,

v?e

believe, would be that many states

that new provide EA or AFDC emergency assistance would be re­
quired to simply abandon emergency relief altogether because
they simply could not afford the extensive program devised by
the Court of Appeals.

In our view, this disruption of state

welfare plans and policies is not required by the Social
Security Act, and the burden of :ny argument here is that de­
cisions below rest upon a misreading of the scope of the AFDC
and EA programs under that Act.
I will begin, with the AFDC program which is by far the
larger arid more important of these two programs.

Under AFDC,

the federal government reimburses a portion of state payments
of aid to families with dependent children, and section 402(a)
and (b) of the Act defines a dependent child roughly as a needy
child who has been deprived of parental support or care as a
result of the death? absence or disability of a. parent.
In order to qualify for federal rim bur seme it for AFDC
payments,, a state must submit a plan to the Secretary that
satisfies the requirements of section 402(a) of the Act, a nd
if the Secretary apprrvms the plan, state payments are

15
reimbursed according to the formula set forth in section 403(a)(1) of the Act under which, as a practical matter, the federal
reimbursement ranges from 50 percent to 65 percent.

Alternative

ly in some cases the state may elect to have reimbursement de­
termined under section 1905 of the Act, and under that provision
federal reimbursement will range from 50 percent to a maximum
of 83 percent.
The normal mode'of assistance contemplated by AFDC is
regulated by regular monthly payments based upon continuing
need.

But the Secretary consistently and from before the enact­

ment of the EA program has approved state plans that provide for
supplemental payments to meet special non-recurring needs, and
at least some states have included within their AFDC plans,
have included within the special non-recurring items emergency
needs arising from, for example, natural or man-made disaster.
Now, unfortunately, as has been pointed out, in part
because of the manner in which this litigation has proceeded,
the record is not satisfactory with respect to prior administra­
tive practice, and the Secretary has never formally defined the
special need items for which since 1949 if not before the states
have been entitled to reimbursement.
But in answer to your questions, Mr. Justice Stewart,
it is clear that the states have included emergency items within
their state AFDC plans.

The booklet which I hold here and to

which the respondents have referred in their brief -

16
QUESTION:

VJhen you say states have, do you mean all

states have them?
MR. JONES:

Mo, not all states.

include special needs at all.

Some statas don't

Some states have no provision

for special needs.
QUESTION:

In any case, your colleague said that

there were 27 states, does that figure apply —
MR. JONES:

I think that is not accurate.

I think

that a total of 45 jurisdictions, that includes not only states
but certain territories, include some kind of special need item
in their AFDC plan.

Unfortunately, although I would have

thought at the outset of this litigation we could have identi­
fied the precise count of the number of states that provide
emergency assistance under their AFDC plans.

In fact, the state

plans are not sufficiently specific to permit us to tell the
Court exactly the number of states.

But just to give the Court

an idea, I will read to you from this booklet a description of
two state plans which I have selected at random

just here at

the argument.
Michigan has a
described as follows:

social oirciu -.stance item which is

’Provisions for medical transportation,

excess shelter when required to preserve equity in home or be~
cause of family size or other unusual circumstances.*

And that

is all it says, end I cannot determine from that whet hex it.
covers the kinds cf emerc

icies wit

17
here.
But let me read you another one from the State of New
York.

It covers provisions for supplies for college or train­

ing school, attendant care, camp fees., life insurance premium,
home delivered meals, replacement of clothing lost in fire,
flood or other catastrophe, purchase of essential furniture re­
quired for establishment of a home, repair of essential heating
equipment, cooking stoves and refrigerators ■— and I will skip
some of the items — restaurant allowance, temporary shelter
and hotel, allowance to meat increased needs of pregnant
mothers.

There are a variety of special needs there but it is

clear that some of them include emergency needs that arise from
fire or other catastrophe.
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose the best test of the ad­

ministrative interpretation of special, need items is your stand­
ing here on behalf of the agency tailing us that they do include
what Illinois is now doing.
MR. JONES 2

Well, there is little more in the record.

Actually there is very little, if anything, in the record of
this case which establishes prior administrative practice.

Per­

haps one reason why there has been little emphasis on the
special items in the past, is that since AFDC provides for
regular monthly payments, in many cases an emergency, emergency
needs can be promptly translated into a decrease in assets or
an increase in expenses and therefore are reflected in the

18
changing calculus of monthly benefits, for that or some other
reason.
It is true that the Secretary's construction of the
Act has not been widely publicized, but there can be no doubt
that the AFDC program in fact has been construed as permitting
reimbursement of AFDC emergency benefits.
QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, could. I ask you a question that
0

you can cover as you go along.

Just looking at it rather broad-

ly, if the EA program allows 50 percent reimbursement and the
AFDC program allows a larger percentage of reimbursement, and
if the state could be covered under either program, why would
it ever elect to be under the EA program?
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:

Well —
It can give to broader categories.
That's correct, Mr. Justice Stevens.

It

xs
QUESTION:

But Illinois doesn't give to broader Cate­

gories.
[R. JONES:

Well, that's right, and I think frankly

one' of the mysteries in this case is why Illinois ever chose to
have an EA program rather than ar. AFDC emergency program.
QUESTION:

And that is the only legitimate source of

funds?
MR. JONES:

Wei"', there ire some minor differences

between the two programs that I will reach in a moment, and I

have no independent knowledge of whether those differences af.
feeted the state's decision.
simply ill-advised.

It nay be that the state was

On the other hand, I should point out that

the State of Illinois at the present is at the 50 percent level
in its AFDC reimbursement.

The formula under which federal

reimbursement is calculated depends upon a ratio in part at
least of per-capita income in the state, per-capita income in
the nation, and right now that works out so that Illinois re­
ceives the minimum reimburseraent under the statute.

So for

Illinois, in terms of the direct monetary reimbursement, there
was probably no difference.
QUESTION;

It was not true at the time of the program

involved here, too?
MR. JONES:

I do not know, Mr. Justice Stevens.

know that since 1975 that has been the case.

I

At any rate, our

submission is that the remedial purpose of the AFDC legislation
and its broad language compels the conclusion that the
Secretary is authorized to reimburse the states for their
emergency payments under tlr.vt program.
Now, whereas the AFDC program is designed to meet the
needs of statutorily defined families with dependent children,
that is of one. parent or no parent families, the EA program is
designed to afford short-term assistance to a much broader
category of families, without regard to the requirement of
dependency that is the lynch-pin of the AFDC program.

20
As is the case with AFDC, a state must submit to the
Secretary an EA plan that satisfies the applicable requirements
of section 402 (a) of the Act in order to qualify for federal
reimbursement.
Some of the requirements of section 402(a) do not
apply to the EA plans; however, and in particular the require­
ment in section 102(a)(10)

that benefits be paid to all persons

who satisfy the federal definition of eligibility by its terms
applies only to AFDC plans and not to EA plans»

Instead, the

Secretary has indicated by regula .ion that the states may set
their own EA eligibility conditions and they specify the par­
ticular emergency needs that their EA plans will meet.
Now, a major difference between EA and AFDC, as .we
have already discussed, is the difference in the applicable
formulas that determine federal'reimbursement.

EA is always at

50 percent, whereas, depending upon the formulas that apply,
AFDC reimbursemont may be from 50 to 83 percent.

And in this

connection I would like to point out a correction that we have
made in our brief.
In Footnote 16, at page 27 of our brief, we had in­
dicated that in some circumstances the formula for determining
EA and AFDC reimbursement may be the same.
incorrect.

That stat «nent is

We pointed out in a letter to the Clerk last

August, which I understand has been distributed to the Court,
that different formulas always will apply to these two programs.

21
Now, there are other significant -—
QUESTION:

There is some other little typo or some­

thing in there in this, is that right?
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
Right.

MR. JONES:

That’s right, Mr. Justice Stewart.

Now;. there are other differences between the AFDC and
the EA program in addition to those relating to the kinds of
families who are potentially eligible and the rata of federal
reimbursement.

.One of this has already been alluded to, where­

as AFDC assistance may be continuous, that emergency needs may
be met whenever they arise, EA assistance is available only, as
the statute says, for a period not in excess of 30 days in any
12-::onth period.

In other -fords, under EA, a family is limited

to one emergency per year, and there is no similar limitation
under the AFDC program.
And there axe other differences, as we point out in
our brief at pages 23 to 27, relating to work requirements, age
limitations, living arrangements within the family, and family
income.
With this statutory background 'in mind, it is some­
what easier to understand the inception and to follow the pro­
gress of this lawsuit.

In 1973, as has been indicated, the

State of Illinois adopted an AFDC plan and the Secretary ap­
proved that plan.

Excuse me, the State of Illinois adopted, an

22

EA plan and the Secretary approved it.

The EA plan covered

only AFDC beneficiaries and provided benefits in certain
enumerated circumstances,
As I. have indicated, it is not entirely clear why the
state chose to provide EA coverage since it could have simply
amended its AFDC plan to cover the same beneficiaries.

Never­

theless, the state did adopt an EA program and this litigation
resulted.
The respondents have challenged that EA program on
two related grounds.

First, they claim that the state's plan

is too narrow and. should be extended to all needy
with children.

families

Second, they contend that the state should pro­

vide assistance whenever necessary to avoid destitution and not
just in certain enumerated emergencies.
Our position in essence1, is that these contentions fail
to make out a cause of action.

The respondents have bean unable

to point to a source of positive law that entitles them to the
extended EA coverage which they seek.

Their claim is that

section 406(e), which defines emergency assistance to needy
families with children, constitutes a federal definition of
eligibility, EA eligibility, and that section 402(a)(10) of the
Act makes that definition mandatory upon the states.
But section 406(a), the definition does not purport to
establish eligibility.

It does no more than define the outer

perimeter within which the Secretary may make reimbur

t.

23
Now

in doing so, section 406(e) dees define in a general way

a class of potentially eligible EA recipients.

But section

402(a)(10) does not require a participating state to make EA
payments to everyone who is eligible to receive them.

As the

Court of Appeals recognized and as the parties here now
apparently agree, 402 (a)(10) by its terms is limited just to
AFDC plans, not to EA plans.
Accordingly, insofar as it rests upon the statute at
all, the respondents’ argument boils down to an inference from
section 402(a)(10) that Congress intended to impose mandatory
eligibility standards upon state EA programs as well as upon
state AFDC programs.
This argument has, we believe, three separate and
independently conclusive answers.

First, the logical inference

to be drawn from the statutory tent is just opposite to that
that the respondents would draw.

Since Congress explicitly

made 402(a)(10) applicable only to the AFDC program, it must be
inferred that Congress intended that that provision would not
apply to the EA program.
Secondly, the respondents’ argument in this case is
inconsistent with this Court’s reasoi ing in New York Department
of Social Services v. Dublino.
mined that in the

In that case, the Court deter­

wee of a clear manifestation of congres­

sional intention, section 402(a) of this Act, this very section
would not be read as restraining the considerable latitude that

24
the states must be allowed in setting their own welfare policies.
Here there is no such clear manifestation of legis­
lative intent, and the respondents' argument by implication
does not remedy that deficiency.
And third, the task of interpreting and applying this
statute has been delegated in the first instance to the
Secretary, and the Secretary has construed the Act as granting
the states leeway to set their own EA eligibility standards,
and that construction should be accorded deference in the
absence of compelling legislative intent, legislative history
to the contrary, and there is none here.
In this regard, I would like to dispel any confusion
that may have been created by the respondents' claim that the
Secretary's regulations have been superseded.

The respondents

in their brief contend that the so-called Townsend regulations,
which the Secretary adopted in the wake of this Court's de­
cisions in King v. Smith, Townsend v. Swank, and Carleson v.
Remillard, supersede the specific EA regulations,.
But the Townsend regulations do no more than acknowl­
edge the Townsend line of decisions which were that

'02(35(10)

imposes mandatory federal eligibility requirements on AFDC
programs.

All the regulations do is say in effect that the

states mist abide by the requirements of the statute, the regu­
lations do not go further and attempt to define those require­
ments.

In particular, they do not purport to require the states

to abide by a mandatory federal EA eligibility requirement.
Accordingly, the Townsend regulations have not superseded thapvi
Secretary’s more specific regulations relating to the EA pro­
gram.
For all of these reasons, we submit that the Court of
Appeals erred in its first decision in this case.

States par­

ticipating in the EA program are not required to pay benefits
to every needy family with children in every circumstance pre­
senting the risk of destitution.

Instead, they may set their

own eligibility, their own reasonable eligibility standards,
and limit relief to those circumstances and emergency needs
that they deem most compelling.
QUESTION:

That was the Court of Appeals first de­

cision that you say was erroneous?
MR. JONES:

That's correct, that is the so--called

Maud ley 7. decision.
QUESTION:
MR. JONESi

Right.
And we believe all Illinois attempted to

do here, is to set reasonable eligibility standards and limit
relief, tailor relief to those circumstances that met its own
local needs.
In any avent, once the state ended the EA program that
was the subject of this lawsuit.. the case was moot.

It makes

no difference that the state then amended its AFDC plan, which
it could have done from the outset, to cover special emergency

26
needs.

As I have explained at sane length —
QUESTION:

Mr. Jor.es, is it truly moot, because if we

should buy your argument that you have made thus far and let
the state know that it has the option to reinstate an SA plan,
is it not something that might be likely to reoccur?

If the

law were clarified in their favor, is it not a very realistic
possibility that then they would say we will reinstate our old
plan?
MR. JONES:

Well, that may very wall ba.

One of the

ironies of my situation is that if I convince you, as I think
is correct, that there are substantial differences between
these two programs and you determine that once the state shifted
to AFDC, the particular complaint that the respondents made is
moot, then there would be nc occasion for you to reach the
underlying issue that the lawsuit originally involved.
QUESTION:

That is what I was going to ask you.

many of these issues do we need to take cn?

Court is that of mootness.

And for that reason, Mr. Justice

Stevens, although had you given an opinion with regard to the
scope of the EA program, the state might have been able to take
advantage of it and the litigation could have resumed.
QUESTION':

Mr. -Tones, under the normal test, if the

litigation is the real life controversy when the complaint isfiled and when the District Court first decides the merits,
then the defendant abandons what is held to be an illegal

activity and resorts to some other program, that normally
doesn't moot a case, does it, as 1 ong as the defendant can go
back to what he started with under W. T. Grant and cases like
that?
MR. JONES:

MR. JONES:

QUESTION:

I think the Court must first decide whether the APDC plan per­
mits the states tc pay emergency benefits.
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:

If it

Because that is what is going on now?
That's correct.

Nov/, if that is per­

missible, then, as Mr. Justice Stevens suggested, the question
is whether, having shifted to a valid plan., the state has
rendered moot the initial controversy, and that would depend
upon an assessment of the likelihood that it might go tack to

30
its original sinful ways.
QUESTION:

But unless this Court were to consider

Handley I, the state would be forbidden by the mandate of the
Court of Appeals in Handley I from going back to that.
MR. JONES:

Not if this court case were declared moot.

But if the Court concluded that if it held the case were moot*
the state might recur to its forbidden EA program, then you
would have to conclude to the contrary that it is not moot and
therefore you would have to reach the question of whether the
EA program can be tailored in the way the state has done it.
QUESTION:

Well, is W. T. Grant a mootness case?

As

I understand it, it holds that the discontinuance of the illegal
practice is a factor that the chancellor may consider in decid­
ing whether car not to grant an injunction* but it does not
render the controversy moot, and that is exactly what v.a have
got here.
MR. JONES:

We have proceeded under the hypothesis

that the state would not revert to an EA program since it can
satisfy its needs under the A?DC program, but there may be
reasons why the state would actually prefer an EA program be­
cause of the differences between the two programs.
QUESTION;

The state is here saying I want it estab­

lished whether I am free to go ore route or another.

Why is ths

MR. JONES:

The case has asked that the cases to be

MR. JONES:

do, want to include in their EA program certain beneficiaries
who are ineligible under the AFDC program, it seems to me that
it is entirely reasonable to assumo that Illinois might want
to broaden its coverage sometime in the future.

ment we have made in our brief with regard to the propriety of
the scope of relief ordered by the Court of Appeals.

was certainly — well, in our evaluation the case was moot in
the District Court.
Once the Court of Appeals broadened the relief of
Manclley I in its Manet ley II judgment, then the implications of
that decision certainly e\ tended beyond the State of Illinois.
And although the

case might be moot as to Illinois, arguably

it might not be moot as to many other states which would be
concerned about the validity of their programs.

ORAL ARGUMENT 01 MICHAEL F. LEFKOW, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. LEFKOWs

Mr, Chi

33
Court;
1 believe the arguments that you have heard from the
petitioners point out the difficulties that they bring to the
Court when they don’t follow orderly appellate procedures, and
I would like to briefly state what the procedures have been so
far in ray opening statement.
More them two years ago, the Court of Appeals for the
Seventh Circuit in Mandley 1 held that Illinois could not grant
federally funded emergency assistance to .some needy families
eligible under 406(e) of the Social Security Act while denying
it to equally eligible fa allies under the Act.

This decision

came approximately two years after the complaint was filed in
the Northern District of Illinois

in so holding that Illinois'

definition of emergency need conflicted with the federal defin­
ition of emergency assistance to needy families with children
contained in title IV~K of the Social Security Act, the Court
of Appeals followed the line of unanimous decisions of this'
Court starting with King v. Smith, Townsend v. Swank, Carleson
v. Remillard.
How, rather than comply with the Court of Appeals
ruling or abandon federal fluids or -petition this Court for
certiorari, the Illinois welfare officials, with the coopera­
tion and approval of the Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare, implemented a fictitious abandonment of federal funds
for emergency assistant

ich has enabled it to maintain its

illegal program for more than two years after the judgment in
Mandley I.
QUESTION:

entirely separate litigation from Mandley I?
MR. LEFKOW:

but is different in that ~~
QUESTION:

Is it a different case in the District

Court?
MR. LEFKOWs

Mandley I are not bound under any document res adjudicata by
Mandley I?

In what sense?

It is the law of the case, Your Honor,
but it is not law of the case in this

Court, it is the law of the case ;.n the Seventh Circuit.
MR. LEFKOW:

I understand that. Your Honor.

We to say

that the petitioners did not follow the orderly procedures to
present this case for review on certiorari, should this Court
deem it vrorthy of certiorari after the judgment in Mandley I

35
that has resulted, in the Court of Appeals having to make a
second decision to enforce its first decision, and further re­
sulted in many needy families in the State of Illinois being
denied emergency assistance.

This is a case where the state

has taken tactics to delay, delay, delay.
What they did is they merely relabeled their emergency
assistance plan as special assistance, submitted it. to HEW,
without giving any notice to the court or to the respondents
that they had done this.

HEW approved that plan for federal

funding; placed its stamp of approval on it.
QUESTION:

Why should they have given notice to the

court?
MR. LEFF.OW:

They should have given notice to the

court because it is a court of equity that was considering an
emergency assistance program.

QUESTIONS
MR. LEFKOW:

If it effects the litigation?
Well, Your Honor, I think it is clear

that it did affect in our opinion the litigation.

It was

clear in the Court of Appeals opinion that it affected the
litigation.

The Court of Appeals found that the petitioners

had engaged in circumvention of tie mandate of Mandley I and
we believe the Court of Appeals was clearly correct in that, for
all the reasons that they lay out in their opinion.
HEW, as I said, also approved this plan without giv­
ing any notice to the court or to the respondents.
QUESTION;
MR. LEFKOW;

Was HEW a party to the first litigation?
They were, Your Honor.

on the motion of the State of Illinois.,

They were joined

HEW *— the petitioners

then advised the District Court that Illinois no longer had can
emergency assistance plan, contrary to the representations
made here today, they did not tell the court that they were
going to fund the program us regular AFDC.

They had asked the

court for more; time to consider what to do after the mandate
in Mandley I came clown, because they wanted to consult certain
legislative committees* at which time they proposed tha plan
to avoid the mandate.

That was on November 17th, and this is

noted in the opinion.
I happened to have beer, at the committee meeting that
day, and the nenfc day they came is •.to court and told the court

37
that they were going to fund this program solely with state
funds.

The Court of Appeals noted that also.
By doing so, they obtained a dismissal eventually

that the case was moot.

On appeal, again, the Court of Appeals

in Mandley II promptly reversed and remanded with direction to
the District Court to enter the proposed final judgment and
decree with certain modifications

This is one year ago,

despite this Court's denial of a stay of mandate to HEW and to
the state, the District Court has declined to enforce the judg­
ment pending this Court's review.
Now,

the petitioners say that the judgment in Handley

XX was wrong and unnecessary and, moreover, now claim that the
Court of Appeals erred in Handley I as well.

We think that

Mandley II was right and needed, although --* and we hold the
same opinion obviously as to Mandley I, although we don't think
the petitioners have properly sought review of that decision in
this Court.
The respondents concede that federal judicial power
has substance in our national life and in our constitutional
jhts.

If it is a power not subject o defeat at the

hands of resistant litigants, then the Court of Appeals judgment
must be upheld.
The Court of Appeals in Mandley I considered for the
first time by a Court of Appeals the 1956 congressional enact­
ment of an emergency assistance program.

This program had a

38
number of purposes.

It provided that both people eligible for

AFDc and people not eligible for AFDC would be eligible for
emergency assistance.

It did provide short-term help to help,

get a family over a crisis, a family over a crisis so that
they might not have to be dependent upon the regular aid pro­
gram,

In addition, they provided emergency help for families

already receiving regular AFDC or families eligible to receive
X V-«

In fact, the Senate report noted that this type of
family would Is the typical type of family that would be elig
ible for emergency assistance, the family who is or eligible
to receive AFDC.
The legislation authorised emergency need3 to be met
immediately by giving flexibility as to the form of payment.
A state could provide the payment in a hurry by cash, in kind,
by vendor payments, or sucJi other method as the stato might
specify.

The program was optional with the states and it was

limited to a 3 0-day period and 12-month period.

And to encour­

age the states to participatef- Congress offered the states 50
percent matching funds for payments made as emergency assistanc
Mow, under finis legislation there are five points of
eligibility,

arrangements in a home fox: a child , and neither the child nor
the relative can have refused without good cause to accept
employment or training for employment.
In 1971,, Illinois adopted its first emergency assis­
tance program under section 406(e).

It provided nearly com­

plete eligibility in terms cf the federal statute.

It provided

that, the aid would ba given from the local offices throughout
the state by a disbursing order.

That is a form given to a

merchant for, say,, $10 for food or $15 for clothing, or what­
ever .
In 1973, the state administratively constricted ,elig­
ibility ir. the: face of contrary state legislation which requires
them to have a full program and limited emergency assistance
;

to new applicants for AFDC, the recipients were homeless as a
result of fire, and recipients who have been evicted for
reasons other than nonpayment cf rent.

And I have noticed in

the regulations just this summer that they have eliminated even
those evictions, :>o now any family evicted in Illinois who is
without: available resources cannot receive any emergency assis­
tance from the; public aid department.
In addition, they excluded all non-AFDC eligible
families.

As a result of this, no relief from destitution was

available to many families lacking food and clothing, all
evictions now, crimes against parsons or property» utility
failures or turnoffs,as a result of agency error or .Islay, or

40
if a child was abandoned by a parent.
The state also centralized the distribution of emer
gency assistance in the state capital.

After an applicant's

request was approved, the caseworker mailed the form to
Springfield for final approval and then if that was approved
there, a check was mailed back to the recipient somewhere in
the state.
As a result of these procedures, Illinois cut its
expenditures for emergency assistance from $2.5 million a year
to $500,000 a year.

In doing so, they referred many of the

people they used to aid to privato charities, some of whan
have: joined this suit as amicus curiae, for instance the
United Way cf Metropolitan Chicago, one of its components,
the Council for Community Services, which is an umbrella group
of about 280 private charities or social service agencies as
an amicus curiae in this suit.
These charities, lacking a regular budget to provide
the need that the state has traditionally provided and ought
to provide, have bean unable to help many of these poor people
arsd the so people then are just new suffering, bearing their
own suffering, as this Court said in the Maricopa County case,
’

Illinois testified at tie trial that the reasons

they constricted tl a program were for administrative ease and
to prevent abuses and fraudulent applications.

The District

Court ruled that the department was processing

applications

much too slow, that delays of seven to ten days in assistance
were not uncoramon,.

They held for the state and federal de­

fendants on the eligibility provision.

On appeal, the Court

of Appeals in Manci ley I reversed, holding that Illinois could
not constrict eligibility among needy families following the
line; of decisions that this Court has made.

And it is an im­

portant principle that they followed, because by doing sc they
insured that the people get the aid that Congress meant to
have the aid.
Further,

the court in Handley I followed what I think

is a traditional pattern and practice in litigation, at least
in r.y knowledge of it, when they invalidated the regulation of
an agency# be it federal or state,

ey did not order HEW to

file draft regulations with the court to conform to Handley If
they suggested that it would be helpful to the states and to
the courts if HEW would exercise its rulemaking power to give
a now regulation, to replace the one that the court invalidated.
In following the principle
which 1 believe

this Court has said,

stated succinctly in Townsend v. Swank,

that states may net vary eligibility requirements from federal
standards in the absence at least of an authorization clearly
evidenced upor the Act or its legislative history, the Court
bo the Illinois situation and it

found in section 406(e) CD two areas- of state discretion and
no more.

They found flexibility — they found an area of

42
discretion for the form of payment, the state could, as I
said, make cash, vendor payments, and it found that

the states

could in 406(e)(2) include migrant workers if they wished.

But

there was no evidence in the Act to allow it to exclude the
families that Illinois had excluded.
This pointing out of areas of state discretion is,
as this Court noted in Townsend, cogent evidence that Congress
intended no further discretion to fee given to the states to
narrow eligibility,.

And indeed the petitioners point to no

evidence on the face of the statute —
QUESTIONs

lit. Lefkow, don't yon leap one point, at

least they say you do — I want to be aure I have your answer
to it.

They cay that the mandatory language in 402(a) (10)

that was controlling in Townsend doesn't apply to the EA pro­
gram, and therefore you don't have the same argument that you
had in Townsend,

How-, what is your answer to that?

MR. LEFKOW;

My answer is that there is an error in

their understanding, I believe, of the cases.

First, we would

r that the result is the same whether 402(a) (10) applies or
not, because the principle of this Court*3 decisions is the
conflict of the state-5 s regulation with the federal statute
and not 402(a) (10).

In 402(a) (10), the Court focused on

making sure tl it all eligible individuals receive assistance.
For instance, in Townsend, the Court italicised the term “all
eligible" twice in the opinion.

Moreover, 402(a)(10) would not

43
normally have emergency assistance because it is an optional
program with the state.

This is our argument, that it applies.

Once a state opts to provide emergency assistance, then
402(a)(10) would become operative.

In other words,

the term

"aid to families with dependent children" includes whatever
aid is provided under Title IV“A.

QUESTIONS

Mr. Lefkow, can I approach this from just

a slightly different angle.

Assume, contrary to the suggestions

that have been made so far, that the Court should address
Manci ley I as the first issue, and assume further — and I am
not suggesting that this would be the conclusion -- that the
Court should disagree with you and reverse Handley I, would it
not be true that in that set. of circumstances you would have no
interest in the outcome i>. Mandley II?

Thera would be no

reason to reach Mandley II if we did it that way?

As if we

held that the state had the or could grant less than the
federal government authorised, which it tried, to do in the
first instance, and wo rejected your argument there, wouldn't
that end the litigation?
MR. lEFEDW:

No, it would not:, Your Honor, because

as we mentioned, the state has a statute which requires them
to fully participate; and, number two, we have alleged equal
pr o tection violation.

QUESTION:
MR. LEFKOW;

Right.

Who petitioners have I believe

conceded that point right here in this Court.

And if the

legislative language of the statute is not clear enough, the

50

legislative history clearly confirms that this was a new program
and that if any authority? which we don't believe existed? had
lied with HEW to provide special needs, provide emergency
assistance as a special need, it was clearly superseded by the
congressional direction, clear congressional direction in
406(e) in 1969.

And you raised this question right at the

start? I believe, with the petitions, and it struck me.
They cited this handbook of public assistance admin­

istration regulation which was the book of regulations that HEW
had before they began prcaulgating them in the Federal Register
and the Code of Federal Regulations.
special need regulation tc the Court.

And they read that
There is no mention in

it of emergency assistance..
What they did net mention in their briefs or in
theix argument here is that prior to 1968, HEW had some regu­
latory material on emergency situations that xm cited in our
brief, as section 3434.2 of the handbook of public assistance
administration.

They had one on emergency payees, and they

had a section on emergency situations prior to complete deterini n ? t i on.s of e 1 igibi 15. ty.

If um had any authority at all to provide emergency
assistance, it would have been under these provision'.

But 1

think it is clear from the testimony of the administration’s
only witness at the i \.i\nto hearings, xrho was Under Secretary
Wilbur Cohen, that HEW hadn't viewed that they had no authority.

51

...

Under Secretary Cohen testified that there is no mechanism in
existing law to meat the emergency needs of children in a
crisis situation, and the remarks on the floor of both the

-t

Senate and the House reflect that it was a new law, a change
in the existing law, for the first time the government will
match payments for emergency assistance.
So I think it is

refcfcy clear tMt whatever may Jmv t

been before the congressional direction in .1968 pointed the w y
for states to provide emergency assistance, if they provided it
at all.

And under the cooperative federalism which pervades

the Social Security Act, the states don't have the ability to
faiior eligibility.

They have been given the right to set

standards in these.
Illinois, for instance, say in providing shelter for
somebody who is destitute, they don’t have to buy him a house,
they don't have to pay him two months back rent.

If they

happen to find a barracks that was ~~ and Chicago is pretty
cold right now —- thr.t was heated and it was adequate, this is
a minimal program, this is not a support program in the sense
that the AFDC program is a support program.

The standards of

the Act itself say that the payments have to be necessary to
avoid destitution, so that there is not going to ba any fat in
the payments that the state makes.

HR. LEFKOW:

that is when they refuse to accept .employment, or training for

QUESTION?

Well, that is what that legislation is

about„
MR. LEPKOW;
soci.

It certainly is, and this is a sound

al policy that Congress has adopted in this legislation.
We would say, or.a further point on Hand ley II is that

there is no evidence in the statute of the dual authority to
provide emergency assistance that the petitioners claim.

There

is simply one way and that is that it has to meet the eligibil­
ity requirements of section 406(e).
How, I do want to make reference to this idea that
45 states provide special needs, and X believe that there was
an inference that many states provide emergency assistance.
Well, I think one of them did say that only 5 states provided
assistance, and from what we have: gleaned from this document
of EE?'?, which is not really very clear, only 5 states provide
some very limit ad items of assistance.

But in their brief,

HEW concedes 27 statos participate in the emergency assistance
program* and 15 of them — and I «

The

analysis of the legislation and the history of the legislation
I think prohibits their conduct and prohibits their claiming

If they had had a reasonable basis for

Now, they also did not redefine their special need
regulation.

They could have put in eligibility standards in

that if they really believed, that they could do it under AFDC.
They could have put in a timeliness requirement because there
is no — under AFDC, there is no forthwith requirement as
there is in emergency assistance.

The only requirement now is

that a person receives assistance within 45 days,, and emergency
assistance delayed is emergency assistance denied.
They didn’t, make any r ee «amend at ions to Congress that

Under those circumstances, there

have been three, years since the complaint was filed in a case
involving the needs of people in most, dire straits and one year
since the mandate had been returned, with no action by HEW.

the Courts
I would like to clarify cur position in regard to
emergency assistance and special needs or emergency assistance
a3 a special need.
Our position is this s

'if a state should be allowed

by this Court to grant emergency assistance as a special need,
a state must still do so in accord with the eligibility requir ement s of section 405(e).

Congress in section 413(a)(5) of

the Act, which is the funding provision, provides that for
federal reimbursement, if a state makcuj payments as emergency
assistance to needy families with children, they must — and
that statute is contained in the yellow brief at page A~4 —

At &-4f subparagraph (5), and the pre­

vious parts would real, with it, the Secretary of the Treasury

services to needy families with children, in the ease of any
state, an amount equal to 50 par-centum of the total amount
expanded under the state pirn during such quarter as emergency

58
assistance to needy families with children.
This language reflects that Congress contemplated
the function of emergency assistance.

If it had just meant

emergency assistance in 4G6 (e), it would not have said other
emergency assistance to needy families with children, it would
have said Bas,51
And I can think of no

better words to sum it all up

than what Judge Cummings said in siting for the court in
Hand.ley IX, ”A rose is a rose is a rose.

Emergency assistance

is emergency assistance, no matter what the state may call it.’
And the Holiciter Sensral hers today acknowledges
that he doesn’t know why the state participated in 406(e)
they can do the same thing as a special need.

if

I suppose we

could all say that if that view should prevail here, that we
donst know why Congress enacted 406(e).

But we think Congress

had a very special .reason tc enact it, and that was to make
sure that all needy families with children who face these dire
circumstances and had no available resources to meet an emer­
gency need receive seve aM.

And a contrary result would mean

that the statute. Congress’ statutes would be, as the Court
of Appeals said in Handley II, totally eviscerated.
