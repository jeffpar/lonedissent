MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 77-693j Honorable Hubert L. Will against Calvert
Fire Insurance Company.
Mr. Freeman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MILTON V. FREEMAN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR*-FREEMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Petitioner in this case, the Honorable Hubert L, Will
is the United States District Judge for the Northern District
of Illinois.

As this Court knows, he is one of our most dis­

tinguished trial judges.

He has been asked on a number of

occasions to address the seminars conducted by the Judicial
Center for newly appointed United States District Judges, to
instruct them.

In the 1970-71 volume, he summarized the basic

assumptions upon which trial courts work as follows:

"The

objective and responsibility of our legal system is to produce
the highest quality of justice in the shortest time and at the
lowest coat consistent therewith.

Justice, particularly the

highest quality, is unique in each case, must be handcrafted
by the most skilled artisans available, each case tailored to
own characteristics,,

The production of justice is essen­

tially a job shop, as distinguished from a mass production
operation."
/

4
This case is a case which tests whether that standard
will continue to be applied to the work of United States
district judges .
The petition granted by this Court was to review a
mandamus of a panel of the Seventh Circuit requiring Judge Will
to proceed to try a case Immediately* despite the fact that in
his judgment the particular case should not be tried but should'
be stayed because the same parties had the same issues pending
before a state court in a prior pending proceeding.

Every issue

was identical* and it was clear to him that it would be the most
wasteful and duplicative exercise for him to proceed to act.

What other alternatives were available to

Should he stay in the interest

of avoiding duplicate and wasteful litigation?

And he had no

hestifcafcion about that.
If I may, I would like to present to the Court the
facts in the case.
The Calvert Insurance Company is a Baltimore, Maryland,
insurance company that engaged in conversations with the American
Reinsurance Corporation, which ran a reinsurance pool for cas­
ualty insurance.

As of January 1, 197^ the Calvert Company

the Maryland company -» joined the pool which consisted of
99 other insurance companies, to reinsure casualty risks.
took place in January of 197^.

That

In early April, two events took

6
place which the parties are contesting before Judge Will,

One

is that a series of tornadoes occurred in the Middle West and
the insurance publications said that reinsurers would be.» quote.,
"murdered," unquote.

Also, in early April 197^ a the financial

statements of the reinsurance pool for the year 1973 became
available.

Late April, the Calvert Company said, "We have been

misled by the information we have been given as to the previous
year's functioning of this pool.

It is regarded by us as

material and we believe we are entitled to cancel this agree­
ment as of the day we entered into it, January 1, 197^, and
avoid liability."
After some discussion, the parties agreed that
Calvert would be excused after the year 197^, hut the pool
insisted that it was liable for the year 197^- and brought suit
in a state court to 99 insurance companies, members of the pool,
sued the Calvert Company and said, "We want a declaratory
judgment that Calvert is responsible for the losses which
appear to be likely to result in the pool."
QUESTION:

Responsible in the sense of being obli­

gated to defend them?
MR* FREEMAN:

No, being obligated to respond to the

In other words, there were losses that were going to

be in the reinsurance -QUESTION:
You said "losses."

I see.

I thought you said ."law suits. "

7
MR, FREEMAN:

Responsible for the losses which

appeared to be likely to result.
The state suit was brought, as I say, July 3* 197^*
for a declaratory judgment.

Calvert, by reason of diversity of

citizenship^ could have removed the case to the federal court.
It did not do so.

It filed various motions in the state court.

And then on January 10, 1975» sIk months later. It filed denials,
answers and counterclaims in the state court,

And the denials,

answers and counterclaims were that membership in the pool was
a 'security, that the security had been sold to them 1) in vio­
lation of the 1933 Securities Act, in violation of Section 10
(b), Rule 10(b)(5) of the *3^ Act

this was by way of an

affirmative defense *»- that it had been sold In violation of
the Illinois securities lav;, that it had been sold in violation
of the Maryland securities law.

And also there are certain

additional defenaees that the American people didn't have the
right to sue and that there was a violation of the Illinois
insurance statute,

i

On the very same day, a complaint was filed in the
federal court.

And the complaint in the federal court tracked

exactly what the affirmative defenses were in the state court0

There were two additional

The federal suit asked., with respect to 10(b)(5)*

I will have

I will stay my action."

QUESTION:

Suppose it goes to trial in the state court

and goes to Judgment.

What's the status of the matter with

respect to federal jurisdiction?
MR. FREEMAN:

I would think the federal jurisdiction

still persists* because he had not dismissed it.

The case is

still pending, but it might well be that a res judicata defense
would be adequate to dispose of the motion.

QUESTION:

There is always a reasonable likelihood

that one of the parties won't like the result in the state
courts isn't there?
court?

Then you relitigate it in the federal

Are you suggesting res judicata might prevent re~

litigating it?
MR, FREEMAN:

That's right.

And that was* Indeed*

Judge Will's hope,, that there might be no necessity for his
using any federal judicial power* if the issues were fully
litigated and decided in the state court.
QUESTION:

What about the right to have the federal

question litigated in the state court?
MR0 FREEMAN:

There is no question and it is conceded

that the federal question* so-called* is a question which the
state court not only has a right to decide but must/under the
Supremacy Clause* decide.

In other words* if there Is a viola­

tion of federal law* that is a defense to a state court action.
QUESTION:

To the exclusion of the federal court's

right to try the case?
MR. FREEMAN:
There is no question
QUESTION:

Oh* no* it's not to the exclusion.
»

I am not sure I track what you mean about

res judicata of the state court holding.
MR. FREEMAN:

If there is a state court holding*

res judicata applies between a state court and a federal court.
The federal court does not have an exclusive right to try the

10

case., unless It wants to.

The federal court has jurisdiction.

It does not have to exercise that jurisdiction if the parties
have another forum, state or federal, in which they can litigate.
And if the issue is litigated in another forum and decided in
another foruin then — For example, if the forum decides that
Calvert was, in fact, misled, and is not bound, then that
judgment should be presented to Judge Will and Judge Will will
decide whether that is res judicata.

Presumably, as I under-

stand res judicata, it would be res judicata.
QUESTION:

The same would be true of any diversity

case, would it not?

You have an action in a state court and

with diversity of citizenship you have action on the same
claims In the federal court.

Whichever one you prosecute, the

judgment will probably be res judicata in the other.
MR, FREEMAN:

That's right.

And that was Judge

Will’s hope here that the matter would be disposed of where
it had first been placed in the state court, and that there
would be no necessity to exercise federal jurisdiction.

But if

there were —. For some reason, the activities in the state
court had not disposed of the matter, then he reserved the
jurisdiction for a time when he could know how much federal
judicial time and energy would necessarily be applying to that,
QUESTION:

Would the hypothetical suggested by

Mr, Justice Rehnquist prevail if one of the parties, having
diversity and the right to try it in federal courts objected?

11

to the proceedings in the state court and asked for removal?
This is not a matter of volition in this case* is it?
MR, FREEMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

You have a right --

One of the parties --

MR* FREEMAN:

Go ahead.

I am saying — the right to remove*

which existed in this case# was granted by Congress for a period
of 30 days.

exercised# it was gone forever.

MR. FREEMAN:
QUESTION:

That's right,

Was there.complete diversity with all of the

defendants In the state court?
MR, FREEMAN:

Yes, apparently.

I haven’t counted all

the 99, but I am so advised,
QUESTION:

That surprises me a little bit>being in

the Northern District of Illinois.
MR, FREEMAN:

Right, but this was a Maryland

corporation that was being sued.

They had a right to remove

it.
The Seventh Circuit granted a writ of mandamus.

It

said, "We recognize in this circuit, in exactly Identical
circumstances, Aetna State Bank v. Altheimer is a case of a
10(b)(5) claim in federal court parallel with a state claim of
the same effect.
We recognize that the federal district courts have
discretion.

And that is the rule that we apply. ..And what Judge

Will did in this case was perfectly correct, in accordance with
our rule.

And we follow Landis v. North American opinion by

Mr, Justice Cardozo, and that is the rule in this Court,
However, since Judge Will ruled, the Supreme Court
of the United States has decided the Colorado River case and
Indian Water Rights case and we believe that we are obliged by
the rulings of the Supreme Court to reverse our findings in

13
Altheimer, to reverse our adherence to Judge Cardoso's opinion
in hand is v, North American. , and to say that the district courts
have no discretion whatsoever, that whenever a case raising a
federal claim is presented to them they must try the case and
we direct Judge Will immediately to try the case.

We say our

own Althelmer case, based on the Land is case, is overruled and
reversed as no longer the law,
Four of the active judges thought that was such a
remarkable ruling and such a misconstruction of the.
wanted en banc consideration,,

they

Four of eight is not a majority

and so we are here.
We say that, plainly, the Seventh Circuit panel mis­
construed the Colorado River case.

It was a case in which this

Court was motivated by the same considerations of judicial
economy by which Judge Will was motivated, that it was a specific
case as to the construction of the McCarran Amendment and both
majority and dissenting judges in that case proceeded from dif­
ferent views as to what was judicial economy,

But in both cases

the Supreme Court said, "We are concerned with conservation of
judicial resources."

And, in fact, on two occasions, the

Colorado River case cited land is v, M o r t h A me r ic a n which the
Seventh Circuit panel felt had been overruled by Colorado River.
We say that if the decision below is not vigorously
rejected by this Court it will encourage wasteful and duplica­
tive litigation, it will make much more difficult efficient,

14

low-cost, high-quality justice*
insisted on taking this case up*
up*

And that Is why Judge Will
The parties wouldn't take it

Department of Justice has a rule that they will not

represent judges when private lawsuits are involved by mandamus
cases.

And they suggested that he retain private counsel and

he has done so*

It is because of his devotion to the swift and

economical administration of justice and his feeling that the
necessity of having a ruling from this Court that applies not
only to him and not onljr to this case, but to all other cases
to show that this Court did not mean, in the Colorado River case,
what the Seventh Circuit panel felt it meant.
This case is, consequently, not the most important
aspect of the matter, but I would like to examine it to show
what can happen if this kind of thing is allowed to go forward.
Here is a very simple case presented to the state court.
Calvert people said, "We were misled,"

The

The pool people said,

"You were not misled, it was a fair deal,"

And if perfectly

clear Calvert was misled, they could be excused from performance.
If fchejr were not misled, they would not be excused from performance.
What is the result of the federal action?
of irrelevant questions are raised.

All kinds

Is there a security?

Is

there a violation of 10(b)(5)?

Is there a violation of

Maryland law, of Illinois law?

They don't make any difference.

QUESTION:

Mr. Freeman, are you assuming that the test

15

of being misled is the same in the state proceeding as It would
be under the Securities Act?
MR, FREEMAN:

I would think that the test in the

state proceedings would be less than :Lt would be under the
Securities Act.

In other words, if there were a false state­

ment or a misleading statement that was material, it would be
a defense in the state proceedings, as a matter of common law,
even without the requirements of deceit, intent to deceive,
(?)

syenter required by the Ernst & Ernst case.

So"that;, they had a

perfect defense, if they were, in fact, misled, even Innocently
by the pool people.

In other words, if the earnings of the

pool were material and they had been misstated and they had
been misled by that into joining the pool, they were home free.
On the other hand, no matter hoi* many times the court decides
that a security is involved, that doesn't help them because
they have to prove that a false statement was made, that it
was material, that they relied on it.
So the question which has been presented by this
reactive federal lawsuit has nothing to do with the merits of
the case.

It will not dispose of It for or against Calvert,

The sole issue which is involved is were they misled or were
they not misled?

But because of this running back and forth

between the federal and the state courts, we stand now at a
situation,in terms of swift and efficient justice, where four
years,almost, after the lawsuit was filed in the state court

16

nothing has happened.

The first deposition has not been taken*

the first item of discovery has not been taken* while it is de­
cided what should be done.
Judge Will saw that.
part of that,

He said., !!1 will not have any

I will stand aside and 2 will let the state

court decide that»"

But because the Court of Appeals panel* in

this case* saw differently and they felt that this Court had
obliged than to overrule what they regarded as a correct exercise
of discretion* and they said that this Court had compelled them
.

'i..

to deprive district courts of the jurisdiction that they had
been previously thought to have under Justice Cardozo's opinion
in the Worth American case.
It is most important that this Court correct those
deficiencies* announce that it does recognize the necessity of
district courts shaping remedies on a handcrafted basis* as
Justice Will said, for the purpose of seeing to it that justice
is provided economically and without unnecessary delay.
And it is for that reason that we are here and that
Judge Will desires a ruling from this Court that its Colorado
River decision has been misconstrued* that the rule of Landis, v.
Worth American remains the law and that he and his fellow dis­
trict judges throughout the-country have the kind of discretion
that is necessary to see that efficient judicial process occurs
and that justice is not unduly delayed by complicating and dupli­
cative litigation

17

QUESTION:
questions.

Mr» Freeman, before you sit down, two

Did I correctly understand you to say that there

has been no progress in the state court proceeding?

I under­

stood, from Judge Wl-ll£c opinion, there had been discovery in
the State court action and that that was going forth.
MRo FREEMAN:

That was his understanding at the time,

Mr, Justice Stevens, but I called Mr .Neither;- counsel for the
American Reinsurance Company, yesterday morning and he told me
that he had filed requests for depositions and had filed notices
to admit and nothing has been done.
QUESTION:

I don't understand why the delay and the

pendency of the federal case should have slowed down the state.
MR. FREEMAN:

I don't know what happened in the state

case, but may I suggest from my own point of view that the
state courts have great respect for the federal judiciary and
if something is pending before the federal courts that may
induce them to
QUESTION:

They may wait for each other forever.

MR, FREMAN:
QUESTION:

Precisely, Your Honor.

That hardly produces the expeditious

result that Judge Will was hopeful about, does it?
MR. FREEMAN:

No, but if his stay order had been

allowed to stand, then the rule would have been clear that the

state courts did not have to wait on him, that they could have
proceeded.

And they would have felt free.

It is only because

18

Judge Will's sensible and reasonable decision was overruled
and a mandamus issued against him by the appellate court that
the state courts properly regard the matter "-as of some conse­
quence* as to whether the federal courts are or should be
actively involved.

Arid they think they are in a position where

they may have to wait for each other — for the federal courts
-- and the federal courts have not said that they don't have
jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

My second question* Mr. Freeman; Is it

perfectly clear that if

I forget which company it is --

prevails in the state by proving there was deception and there­
fore they didn’t have to participate in the pool* would it
necessarily follow that they would not also be entitled to
recover some damages?

I don’t know and --

MR. FREEMAN:

The fact of the matter* as I understand

from the brief* is that no money has been paid by them.

They

have just assumed the responsibility for the certain amount of
losses and they have gotten the right to get a certain amount of
premiums»

They have not paid any money* as I understand it.
QUESTION:

Because there could

be cases in which

a state case wouldn't necessarily end everything and then you
would have to —
MR. FREEMAN:
QUESTION:

That's right.. Your Honor.

But you say this is not such a case.

MR. FREEMAN:

This is not .such a case, and such a case

19
would be a Question In which a remedy as to a stay would be

shaped by the judge In his discretion- if he had it.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Loss.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS LOSS * ESQ.*
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. LOSS:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please the

Court!
If I may* I should like to begin by agreeing most
decidedly with my brother Freeman*that Judge Will is an admir­
able judge.

It just happens that Judge Will and Mr. Freeman

and I have been very good friends for 40 years* all three of

us,
Now* I'd like to get to the question.
Let me start* if I may* with a brief description of
the statutory provisions on jurisdiction.

I don't want to go

through the facts again* but I would like to do this.
Under all of the FCC statutes* except the Securities
and Exchange Act of 1934* the federal and state courts are given
concurrent jurisdiction.

For some reason* Congress in the “3^

Act* said the federal courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction
over all violations of this Act and all suits In equity or
actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created
by this Act.

So that* it is impossible to bring a 10(b)(5)

action ■»- that's the famous fraud rule under the Exchange Act
which has been taking over the universe

It is impossible to

20

bring such an action in a state court.
Now then,, if X sues Y for breach of contract or for
a declaratory judgment in the state court and Y has a defense
based on Rule 10(b)(5)* obviously* the state court must enter­
tain and decide for the defense, under the Supremacy Clause.
Otherwise* it might be giving a judgment under state law when
there is a perfectly good federal defense.
However* that* in a sense* as I suggested In our
brief* is an imperfection in our federal system.

It's a neces­

sary imperfection in our federal system* if you will.

It

doesn’t follow that when X sues Y in a state court for* 1st us
say* breach of contract* or in this case* since the alleged
breach was anticipatory

declaratory judgment

it doesn't

follow that when X sues Y in a state court* under state law*
and Y has a 10(b)(5) defense and a 10(b)(5) counterclaim*
because when Section 27 of the Exchange Act says exclusive
jurisdiction of the federal court* it says over all actions*
not just actions for damages* actions for recisicn as well.
So* it doesn't follow that when the state court
defendant moves into the federal court* expeditiously* as a
federal plaintiff for reelsion — forget the damages for the
moment* arguendo -- for recision in the federal court* it
doesn't follow that in that case the federal court should go
out of its way and ignore the exclusive jurisdiction that
Congress mandated* and stay its hand indefinitely* while the

state court tries the whole case.

So that* when it gets back

to the federal court — unless* of course* we win on the fraud
charges at common law.

But why should we be put to all of that

litigation when we have federal claims and defenses?

It

doesn't follow that in that case the federal court should sit
on its hands indefinitely until the state court finishes —
all the state courts finish — and the case gets back to the
federal court.

At which time* the only decision left is res

judicata or collateral estoppel.

That is a rather strange way

to exercise the exclusive jurisdiction that Congress gave to
the federal courts.
QUESTION:

There are going to be some cases* though*

Mr, Loss* where the federal court* for one reason or another*
is going to say there are related proceedings pending In
another court and we are just not going to set a trial date or
we're not going to have discovery for the next ease months,
MR. LOSS:

Of course* you are.

We don't suggest for

a moment that the federal court is completely without power to
control its docket* although my brother so suggests.
QUESTION:

The Seventh Circuit* in Issuing a writ of

mandamus, which I understood to entertain the idea that it was
not a discretionary obligation of the judge at all* but a
mandatory duty under which he labored which could be enforced
by mandamus* seems to me to have said to Judge Will* "You
simply don't have that kind of power." that you and I just said

22
the court does.
MR. LOSS:

Not any more.

But I suspect the reason the

Seventh Circuit ordered Judge Will to proceed* quote*

"forth-»

with*" end quote* is the amount of delay that ha(6 already
occurred,

And Judge Will had already said*

"Asafar as I'm

concerned* this decision by the state judge that there is no
security Is res judicata.

So* the Seventh Circuit* quite

properly treated that as if it x*/ere a dismissal. , And my brotherFreeman*twice answered questions a half hour ago by saying yes*
a decision by the state court will be res judicata.
Now* we do not concede that* except arguendo.

But

I must concede arguendo that there is a good argument that any
decision by the state court -- and the state appellate court
has already decided there is no security -- will be res judicata
if the case ever gets back to the federal court,
QUESTION:
the federal court.

It Is not a question of getting back to
Judge Will didn't dismiss, in the England

sense or in the Pullman sense; he simply postponed prosecution
of the case in the federal court* did he not?
MR» LOSS:

Your Honor* he postponed it so indefinitely

and so fully and so completely that the only question left for
him* if It ever gets back* will be not was :there a security
which is the question Congress intended him to decide*, but is
the safe decision res judicata or a matter of collateral estoppel?
QUESTION:

But there are bound to be questions of

23

shadings and degree.

How long do you waif?

Are those all

enforceable by mandamus?
MR, LOSS:

No* Your Honor.

The only thing that is

enforceable by mandamus* as this Court very recently said in
Themtron v. Hermansdorfer* is that* the Court said* "a tra­
ditional use of the writ in any appellate jurisdiction* both
a common law and in the federal court* has been to confine an
imperior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed juris­
diction* or to ccmpell it to exercise its authority when it Is
its duty to do so."
QUESTION:

In Thermtron* there was a dismissal.

MR, LOBS:

In form,

There was a dismissal and in

form here there was a mere stay.

But* as the Seventh Circuit

correctly held* I submit* a stay that has all the effects of
a dismissal* as this one does* must be treated like a dismissal
for mandamus purposes.
both ways.

I can't see how my brother can have it

He argues it Is a mere stay* but then he also

said yes * it was a res judicata.

And I think his second

position undoes his first.
QUESTION;

Suppose a federal suit had never been

filed until after the state suit had been completed?

You must

agree you cannot relitigate'the matter in a federal court.
MR, LOSS:

Of course.

Indeed* we worry about res judicata and collateral
estoppel* though we don't admit it.

We worry about it a great

24

deal and that's why we‘are here *

That's why we are making the

argument,
QUESTION:

A fellow with a defense* If he doesn't want

to get it tried in state court, needn’t present it. either.
MR, LOSS:

Well* if I may say so* we did everything

we should have done.
QUESTION:

We raised these questions defensively.
And you certainly tendered it to the

stats court.
MR, LCSS:

We had to or we might have just a default

Maybe* but you also asked for your federal

claim to be adjudicated.
MR, LOSS:

We had to* Your Honor* or we might have

suffered a default judgment.
QUESTION:

So* it is a defect in our system?

MR, LOSS:

I think so.

QUESTION:

Mr. Loss* how would you have suffered a

default with judgment?

I don’t understand.

You had several

defenses.
MR. LCSS:

Well* I suppose we could have answered

solely cn the ground that we had been induced to enter into the
contract by fraud.

But res judicata would bar us as to all*

arguably.
QUESTION:
raised it?

On the security issue* if you hadn’t

MR, LOSS:

But res judicata, as I understand it,

applies to all the issues that should have been raised if
»

the cause of aetiion was the same,
QUESTION i

I see, could have been raised.

MR. LOSS:

Yes,

We are not talking collateral estoppel now.

We are

talking res judicata.
QUESTION;

That's the same case.

It's collateral

estoppel that applies in a different case, isn’t it?
MR, LOSS:

If it's basically the same case, and this

is all one case.
QUESTION:

But it wasn't.

I thought it was two

different actions, one in the federal court and one in the
state,
QUESTION:

Certainly, you couldn't present your

counterclaim, you couldn't present the 10(b)(5) claim there at
all,
MR. LOSS:

If we have to someday, that's exactly

what -we are going to argue.

But it is not clear, Your Honor,

that -» We would say that a state court decision, without
I

jurisdiction, cannot be res Judicata.

They will say they at

least had jurisdiction defensively which we have to admit,
That's the imperfection I talked about.

In that state of

Si

affairs, the only thing that we can say certainly is that the
questions of res judicata are terribly complex.

And this is,

26

perhaps, one of the best reasons why Judge Will should have
proceeded so as to avoid those questions,
QUESTION;

What about the argument that you could

have avoided all these complexities by removing?
MR.. LOSS;

The short of It is. Your Honor, that

counsel for Calvert, his researches did not reveal, to his
mind, the possibility of a security question until after 30
days had gone by.

Now, If that kills us, we are killed.

But I suggest to Your Honors that it shouldn't for a number of
reasons.

One, our negligence, if you like, or our failure to

recognize that point for 30 days doesn't override the exclusive
jurisdiction of the federal courts, insofar as it deprives the
state courts of any
QUEoTION:

But on the other side of the balance, I

suppose, you mention that 10(b)(5) is sort of taking over the
universe.

That 's an awful lot of litigation that may end up in

the federal court if every 10(b)(5) and every antitrust defense
that's ever available requires that the case be tried In the
first instance In the federal court.
MR. LOSS:

It does not, Your Honor, so require.

QUESTION;

I thought — The judge doesn't have the

power to deny your right'to go forward in the federal court.
MR. LOSS :

No, no.

If we had been satisfied to stay

in the state court, the state court could have and should have
— would have had to decide the federal defense.

But we wanted

27
our right — and still do

to have a federal court for various

reasons decide this federal question.
QUESTION:

So it has to only when the plaintiff wants

MR. LOSS:

Exactly,

it to,

Now, it is also purely fortuitous that there was
diversity in this case.

If there hadn't been complete diversity

we couldn't have been moved anyway,, And I take it this Courc
would not want to lay down a rule that depends on that kind of
i

fortuity,

do that I think our failure to remove, regrettable

though it was, should not be a very significant consideration
in the decision of the case,
I suggest, if the Court please, that our case rests
on three or four basic, simple,fundamental propositions that
can be stated in as many minutes.

One, as this Court very

recently and unanimously held in the Colorado River case, I
quote, "It is the duty of a district court to adjudicate a
controversy properly before it."

And in that same case, this

Court called the duty a 'virtually unflagging obligation."
The Court recognized and, indeed, took the opportunity to
summarize in a very useful way, if I may say so, the various
extension doctrines and the like, but emphasized that all of
those are exceptions to this virtually unflagging obligation.
QUESTION:
too, wasn't it?

The Colorado case, itself, was an exception

28

MR* LOSS;

In a sense, yes.

And. indeed* our ease

applies a fortiori because in Colorado there was concurrent
jurisdiction.

Here there is exclusive federal jurisdiction.

Q UBS TI ON:

Bu fc i 11 Colorado the r e wa s dismissal, net

simply withholding.
MR, LOSS:

True., Your Honor., except our answer to

that must be that in substance there was a dismissal here.
This was not an ordinary stay.

Ordinary stay is fine, and

indeed, if the case comes back to Judge Will, if this Court
affirms, subject to whatever the forthwith means., we would not
object to Judge Will's staying this case for a few months if
he had other business that was more important.

We are not sug­

gesting that the federal court has to drop everything and
decide 10(b)(5) cases before other cases.
that when a federal court, quote,

But we are suggesting

’stays," end quote, as in­

definitely and completely as in this case, that's not consis­
tent with the virtually unflagging obligation that the Court
spoke about in Colorado.
QUESTION:

It is not exactly indefinitely.

If the

state court rules, it wouldn't be indefinite, would it?
MR, LOSS;

Well, the state court —

QUESTION:

If the state court rules with all deliber­

ate speed, then it wouldn't be permanent, would it?
MR, LOSS:

The state court could do several things.

One, we would hope to win on the common law; defense.

29

QUESTION;

If the state did nothing to stop the state

court from moving immediately and setting down the schedule for
the depositions and the schedule for the hearings and schedule
for the decision*
MR» LOSS:

True. Mr. Justice Marshall,

When I said

’'indefinitely/' I did not mean in a temporal sense.

I meant

until however long it takes the state court and the state
appellate court to decide the question completely after which
there is. nothing left for the federal court to decide except
the res judicata or collateral estoppel consequences.

And that

is simply not doing what I think Congress wanted the federal
courts to do.

The fact that we could get complete relief by

successfully defending on one ground or another, including the
federal ground, in the state court, should not deprive us of
our right to have a federal court determine our action, our
action for recision.

Twenty-seven says "all action.'

So the first proposition is that we start with the
idea that abstention, and so on, is an exception.

The second

proposition is that, if anything, that applies a fortiori when
the federal jurisdiction is exclusive, rather than concurrent,
although we think it applies in either.
Third, subject to Mr. Rehnquist's point, which I hope
I have answered, this left Judge Will with what this Court
called a clear legal duty in The natron, to decide the case
enforceable by mandamus.

And fourth, there are stays and stays,

30

and we don’t suggest that the federal court Is completely
without power to control estoppel.
Now. everything that my brother has ai.-gued is an
attempt, somehow, to get it out, as he must, one or another
of these very simple propositions.

First, he says we can get

complete relief by successfully defending in the state court.
Well, I've answered that one, I think.

It Is true, but we

prefer to litigate the way Congress said we had a right to
litigate, by bringing an action for recision in the federal
court.

And mind you, vdaen we brought that, nothing had happened

on the state side, except that vie had filed s motion to the
effect that that state action should have been on the equity
side because it purported to be a class action.

And that was

overruled and there was an exchange of correspondence about
discovery, but nothing at all.
The same day on which we filed an answer on the state
side x^e filed the action on the federal side.

Then, my brother,

Freeman, says that Calvert doesn't need 10(b)(5).
state law defense.

We have this

And everything else we did he says is a

bunch of irrelevant questions, raises irrelevant questions.
Well, I suggest, with all respect, these are not irrelevant
questions.

We chose other defenses and other claims which

Congress gave us.

For example, if we satisfy the courts some­

day that there is a security here there v/ill be nothing left to
litigate except a summary judgment motion, because anybody who

31
sells a security without registration is liable under the
Securities Act*

And nobody will enforce a contract that

violates the registration provisions of the Securities Act*
So, I don't think it is for my brother, Freeman, to
say that we are trying to litigate irrelevant questions.
Then the argument is made it's a mere stay, and I
hope I've answered that*
QUESTION:

Come,. Mr* Loss, it isn't even a stay in

the sense that Justice Cardoso referred to it in the Lendis
case where one court was staying an action in another•court.
This is simply Judge Will saying,

"In the control of my own

docket, I will not call this case for trial for sin: months*"

So it really doesn't even rise to the level of a stay.
MR* LOSS:

Well, actually, the Seventh Circuit said

in substance it Is an abatement*

Whatever it is the net effect,

I must say again, with all respect, is to deprive us of cur day
in a federal court except ultimately on the question of res
Judicata.

And that simply is not exercising exclusive juris­

diction to decide questions under the Exchange Act.
QUESTION:

But then you must go further than, at

least, the holdings of the Colorado case and the England case
where you are talking about dismissals.

And you've got to say

that you are talking about calendar control of individual
fed era 1 dist ricts.
MR» LOSS:

Whether there is a stay or a dismissal,

32

I respectfully suggest, is a -matter of substance and not of
terminology.
QUESTION:

And In the Colorado case, the district

court's dismissal was approved by this Court.
MR. LOSS:

Yes.

If something has to be called a dismissal, then,
obviously, we are finished.
QUESTION:

You are not deprived of your ultimate

day in the federal court, except -- Suppose you prevail in the
state court on your federal defense.
MR, LOSS:

Well, if we prevail on any of our defenses

in the state court, we've won, and we don't need any further
litigation,
QUESTION;

I know, but I suppose if you have a 10(b)

(5) claim, you might want to press it.
MR, LOSS:

Well, first of all, 10(b)(5) was treated

as a defense on the state side.
QUESTION:

That means, I suppose, that there was a

viola tion of 10(b)(5).
MR, LOSS:

We allege it.

QUESTION:

Well, assume you prevailed on that in the

state court.

If you were damaged by the 10(b)(5) violation,

I suppose you could then press it in the only court you could
press It in.
MR. LOSS :

If we prevail on any of our defenses in the

33
state court ~~
QUESTION:

No, I'm talking just about the 10(b)(5).

MR, LOSS:

Certainly, if we prevail on that defense

QUESTION;

Then you could come right back to the

federal court and move on.
MRa LOSS;

We wouldn’t even have to. Your Honor

because we would have got everything we wanted.

They are

suing us for a declaratory judgment that the contract is en­
forceable.

And If we have a 10(b)(5) defense, they lose their

case and we are finished.

We've won»

QUESTION;

I know, but what about damages?’

MR» LCSS:

Oh, well, at the moment —

QUESTION;

That's the kind of a claim a 10(b)(5)

MR* LCSS;

A 10(b)(5) claim, Your Honor, can be also

c la im is .

a basis for affirmative reelsion.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

But, nevertheless, you

could come back to federal court with your 10(b)(5) claim.
MR, LQS«;

If there are any damages.

If we have any

they are very minimal in terms of how much money we spent —
QUESTION;

So you are not precluded from return to

the federal court, if you prevail in your defense.

And if you

don't., I am not sure you have much to complain about, either.
MR, LOoS:

Well, I would respectfully suggest we do.

If we lose in the state court, and that's considered res judicata.,

34
we have lost our right to a federal forum.
QUESTION:

Then you've got a right to bring it here

by certiori.
MR. LOSS:

That was going to be my clincher. Your

Honor,,
If this Court leaves this case to the state court,
then this Court, inevitably, In cases like this, is going to be
the first federal court on the scene and this Court is going to
be under considerable pressure to grant more writs for certior­
ari than it is today.
QUESTION:

When you talk about federal courts, do you

mean federal courts on the same level as the Supreme Court?
That’s all you need for your argument.
MR, LOSS:

Yes.

But I do suggest that the net effect

of leaving these cases to the state courts and ignoring the
federal, exclusive jurisdiction of the federal district court,
this will be the only way to correct federal errors, in this
Court.
QUESTION:

... oes it make any difference, in your view,

that the Colorado case was decided under the MeCarran Act and
you are dealing with a security —
MR, LQJb:

Only this. Your Honor, that our case would

be stronger because there there was concurrent jurisdiction
and here, so far as 10(b)(5) is concerned, the federal juris­
diction is exclusive.

If anything, this is a stronger case.

35
QUESTION:

You really don't have any damage claim if

So that there isn't anything that's exclusive.

The

exclusive right is to recover damages, but this is a non-damage
case.
MR. LOBS:

Section 27 says , "Federal courts have

exclusive jurisdiction over all action."

And I don't think,

with all respect, that it's for this Court to say that we can
exercise that reelsion argument by way of defense in a state
court.

Congress said we have a right to a federal court.
QUESTION:

But the judgment that would be entered if

you prevail in the reelsion action, has precisely the same
practical consequences as a judgment that would be entered in

But that's only if we win. Your Honor.

MR» LOSS:

judges are more experienced in these matters.

They know a

Thank you.
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Freeman, do you have

anything further?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF MILTON ¥. FREEMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR* FREEMAN:

Yes.

First, I think I should make it clear that the reason
that the state court® have not acted in this case and have
waited is that every action, as I understand it, has been on
a motion for stay by Calvert.

So, if they are in a hurry to

get justice, they are not in a hurry to get justice in the
state court to which Judge Will remitted them.
Then, Mr. Loss says if we get it decided that this is
a security, then we have some rights because you can't- sell a
security without registration»

But that's under the '33 Acfc

where there is no exclusive jurisdiction, as there is on 10(b)
(5), where the Congress said suit may be brought in any court
of competent jurisdiction,

Bo, as far as the E33 Act is con­

cerned, on which Mr, Loss is mentioning his reliance,

:i

that5s something that Congress said'you ©sin go into a state
court and you can bring affirmative actions in the state ©osarto

38
So„ there is no exclusive federal right.
That leads him down to 10(b)(5) and he says, "I've
got a 10(b)(5) claim which will let me off in the state court,
but X!d like to go into a federal court because 1 prefer that,"
And he's got a right to do that under the First Amendment.

But

it seems to me to be perfectly clear that that's what federal
judges are for, to see that rights which are provided by statute
are not abused so that the courts are made mere puppets to carry
out the desires of litigants for one forum rather than the other
when they are both able to give justice.
And., it seems to me, that that is the essential
element here as to whether you are going to give trial judges
the right to discretion free of the threat of mandamus when
they exercise what the panel itself down below said was a
correct decision on discretion, that this will result in more
efficient justice more promptly,
QUESTION:

Do I understand you to say, Mr, Freeman,

or agree that the federal jurisdiction was exclusive but that
exclusivity was lost by failure to move within 30 days to
remove the case to federal court?
MR, FREEMAN:

No, Your Honor,

They are two separate

and entirely -- one is the right to come into federal court
r

by way of diversity.
30 days.

That was lost because they waited beyond

Congress gave them 30 days to decide where they

wanted to litigate.

They had the choice.

They gave it up.

39
The other point is that there is, it is true, a state­
ment in the Exchange Act that when you have a securities case
and a violation of the Securities and Exchange Act and you want
to sue for damages for that, then only the federal court may
give you damages*
QUESTION:

Only

MR* FREEMAN:
QUESTION:

Only for damages,

You agree with your brother, Loss.

MR, FREEMAN:
QUESTION:

1'or damages,

Yes, we do.

An action for recision —

MR. FREEMAN:

That is the difference.

As a matter

of fact, his pleadings in the state court are very clear on
that point.

They raise 10(b)(5) as a defense and they have a

counterclaim and they leave 10(b)(5) out of the counterclaim,,
QUESTION:

Was there a prayer for damages in the

federal court?
MR. FREEMAN:

In the federal court, it was for

recision,
QUESTION:

And what else?

MR, FREEMAN:

Or in the alternative, for $2 million

in damages.
QUESTION:

In damages?

MR. FREEMAN: Yes, or in the alternative.
QUESTION:
foggNg

Mr. Freeman, a colloquy has developed up

me and one of my colleagues which may be wholly

40

irrelevant, but a ease has come to my mind, cited in neither of
your briefs and it didn't occur to me until now, called Brucecs
Juices, decided maybe 20 years ago, about the availability of a
defense to enforceability of a contract made in violation of
federal law.

I take it, the fact it’s cited in neither brief

means that neither of you considered it to be relevant here?
MR. FREEMAN:

I think it is irrelevant, Your Honor.

That was a question of whether — and we were involved in that
case,
QUESTION:

Is that right?

MR, FREEMAN:

That was the case of the suit on note

and the defense was a violation of the antitrust laws.

What

the Court said was the amount of the note was of such a nature
that they had no relation to the issue of the defense, so that
it was not an appropriate defense to the claim on the notes.
And the Supreme Court decided 5 to 4 that we could not make an
antitrust defense and had to bring a separate antitrust suit.
We couldn't even raise a defense in that case.
QUESTION:

I see why you wouldn't cite it.

MR. FREEMAN:

In this case, it is conceded that

the defense of 10(b)(5) can be raised, it has been raised, it’s
before the state court, and neither party questions that the
defense can be raised.

Whereas, in Bruce's Juices, the point

was that the defense of antitrust violation could not be raised
in the state court on a suit on a note.
