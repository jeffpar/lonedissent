MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Cellar,
ORA If ARGUMENT OF KENNETH 8 , G ELLER. EEC.,
ON BEHAIF 0? THE PETITIONER
MR. GEL-uER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Court granted certiorari in this, ease to resolve
two important issues of federal criminal law.

The first is

whether a defendant may appeal prior to trial from the denial
of his motion to dismiss an indictment on speedy trial .-.rounds.
The second issue which need only be re* cl

d if

that such interlocutory a pper Is are pe-'miss able, is whet he r the
period after criminal char es against the defendant have beers,
c i:.-; miss od but before the same or related charges e re r-einstiti'-ed a., a ins t him should be considered in determining whether
the defendant ‘Isas been deprived of. his right to a speedy tria l.
The facts are as follows.

In the early morning of

feamiary -17, 137-E Respondent’s wife and two small daughters
were clubbed and stabbed to death in Respondent-*® .apartment on
tivj

)

: Eragg military Reservation in North Carolina, where

Respondent ran assigned as a medical doctor.

Respondent, vRu-

some wounds, notified the milltar
attac s. eta Lain

that he and his fa.v3.ly had been'assaulted by

4
ur so-called ‘'hippie©" who had,'apparently# been under the
influence of drugs.
Respondent, at first, v;as viewed as a victim, rather
than as a suspect,

Horever, after intensive but incomplete

investigation of the crime had been conducted by the CUD, tt s
Army’s criminal investigative unit, it became apparent that
many aspects of Respondent’s version of the attach® and of the
subsequent actions, upon discovering his family’s bodies could
not be squared with the preliminary laboratory analysis of the
physical evidence of the crime scene.
In April 197 d* therefore, Respondent was warned that
he ••..as a suspect in the murders, van advised .of his rights by
militer; authorities and was confined to the military reserva­
tion by his immediate commanding officer.

Three weeks later..

Respondent .was formally charged by his commander vifch three
specifications of murder.

As required by Article 32 of the

L/nafon,; Code of Military Justice, an officer. Colonel barren
Roc: ., vc s appointed to investigate the matter and to rec.pr .e, .c

Two months later, in December 1970, Respondent was

granted an honorable discharge by the Army.
Following .Respondent’s release from the Military,
the Department of Justice requested the DID to continue its
investigation of the case.

The CXD did so and in June 1972 it

submitted a massive, thirtedn-volume- report to the- Department
which was supplemented by further reports in Hove.abet 197 •' and
August 197:3.

Respondent was eventually indicted on three

counts of .murder in January .1975 .by a grand jury of the United
ctat.es District Court for the Eastern District of North
Carolina.
Respondent moved to dismiss the indictment on a
number of

rounds, including double jeopardy and denial of

a Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial.

The District Court

denied each of these motions in July 1975 and scheduled

particularly stringent in criminal cases because
and disruptions caused by interlocutory appeals are especially
inimical to the effective administration of criminal iai .
Respondent, of course, does not claim that the pretrial denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment on speedy
trial grounds was a final decision in the sense that it termin­
ated the proceedings against him in the District Court.
Obviously, the court's ruling only allowed the case to
proceed to trial where a number of other factors may have led
to a dismissal or an acquittal.

Rather, Respondent contends

that the denial of a speedy trial motion is immediately
appealable before trial, under the so-called "collateral
order exception" to the final judgment rule.

Could the speedy trial claim have been

presented anew to the District Court in a motion for judgment

intelligently assessed.
Nov?, this Court most recently applied the coilaterc i
order doctrine last terra in Abney v. United States, in holding
that the Courts of .Appeals had jurisdiction under Section 12yi
to entertain an interlocutory appeal from the denial to dis­
miss ah indictment because of double jeo j

In *u

In

that conclusion, the Court stressed that the trial judgefs
pretrial denial of the double jeopardy motio» constituted a
complete,formal and final rejection of the Fifth Amendment
claim in the District Court, that the claim by its very nature
was wholly collateral to and separable from the issues to be
litigated at. the trial, and that, most important, the protec­
tions conferred on an accused by the Double Jeopardy Clause
would be significantly undermined if appellate review had to
vs it until after a conviction,because the Double Jeopardy
Clause protects an individual not only a, rinst being punished
tv ice for the some offense, but also against being tried twice
for that offense.

That aspect of the constitutional right

could not be vindicated by reversal of any conviction obtain ad
at the second trial, and would • e irreparably lost unless an
Immediate pretrial appeal were permitted.
And, we've explained at some length in our brief
why the denial prior to trial of a speedy trial motion, unlive
the denial

f a double jeopardy motion, is not normally a

s c,

9
as I Just explained in -response to a question by Me. Justice
Ifehnquist, an intelligent application of the Barker view in
those standards often may not be possible before trial,

Fey

many of the same reasons speedy trial claims,again unlike
double jeopardy claims, are not wholly collateral to the
matters to be raised at'trial/ because only after the trial
can it be determined whether the defendant has truly been
prejudiced by the pretrial delay.
Respondent has not seriously disputed these con­
tentions in his brief;

Instead,' he asserts that the Sixth

Amendment Speedy Trial Clause, just like the Fifth Amendment
double Jeopardy Clause, creates a so-called "right not to be
tried," a right which to be effective requires recognition of
the concomitant ri ht to immediate appellate review.
there is little to support this assertion.

But

As the language

of the bixth Amendment suggests, its, tl e delay before trial
and not the trial itself that violates the constitutional
guarantee.

The concern of the sixth Amendment is not the true I

but any delays surrounding it.
If the pertinent factors identified in Barker j
kinnjo coalesce in a particular case to deprive a defendant of
his right to a speedy trial, that violation, by definition,
mutt have occurred iri or to the beginning of a trial.

By the same token, and a,; a in by contrast to the

Fifth Amendment protection against double jeopardy, the
effectiveness of appellate review of speedy trial claims is
not diminished in any v;ay by awaiting the outcome of the

trial*
This Court has identified three interests of a
defendant that the Speedy Trial Clause is designed to protect.
First, to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration.

Second.;

to minimize pretrial anxiety and concern of the accused.
And third to limit the ptssibility that the defense will be
impaired by the loss of evidence.
It is obvious that no remedy, whenever offered,
can truly undo or alleviate the annoyances or anxieties that
a defendant may have suffered while awaiting trial.

But the

reversal of the defendant's conviction after trial would be
equally as effective as the dismissal of indictment before
trial, to compensate that defendant for any emotional harm he
way have suffered, and would also be equally as effective as
a mean# of punishing the Government for the delay.
Similarly, a defendant's interests in avoiding a
conviction, based on lost evidence or dimmed memories, can be
fully protected Ly a reversal of any conviction procured after
a

.'erica of unconstitutional pretrial delay.

Thus, deterrin;

remedies.

u
Any-Sixth Amendment violation can be remedied as well after
trial as before„
Wow, since speedy trial claims, thus, do not
satisfy any of the criteria of a collateral order doctrine,
there is no justification for countenancing a breach of the
normal rules against interlocutory .appeals in criminal cases
for such claims.

Indeed, there are strong reasons why in cur

view it would be especially inappropriate to allow defendants
to take interlocutory immediate appeals in the district courtfg
denial of their speedy trial motioni

That is because the

Speedy- Trial Clause, unlike the Double Jeopardy Clause and,
.indeed, unlike any' other- protections of the Bill of Rights,
is designed as much to foster the interests of socj ity
expeditious ,-csolution of criminal cases as to confer protectiona upon indi. idual def enda 111s .

making about delay.

I- e- recognize, of course, that this Court in f bn eg

Chile this. Is, perh

true in double Jeopardy cases, there are two reasons whj

it is

exceedingly unlikely to be true with respect to speedy trial
claims.

First is that it is much more difficult to allege

a plausible double jeopardy violation.

There must be some

showing that the defendant has once before been in jeopardy of
federal conviction on the same or related charges.

Very fev

defendants can make or even approach that showing.

claim, I noted at the outset that this Court need not reach
it if it agrees with us that the court below lacked juris­
diction over Respondent's pretrial appeal.
As the Court of Appeals acknowledged and, indeed,as Respondent concedes, no significant delay, and certa ini./ no
delay approaching constitutional Magnitude occurced in this
case between January 1573 when Respondent was indicted andAugust 1975 when his: t rial was set to begin.

The Court of

Appeals* holding that Respondent was deprived of his right to
a speedy trial, thus, plainly rests on the premise that
Respondent rs Sixth Amendment right attached in the spring of
1970 when he.'was arces red by the Army and that his - right
continued unabated until August 1975* even though all of the
militar/ enarres against Respondent had been dismissed and
he had been released from all restraints cn his liberty in
October of 1970.
The court below has, therefore, reached the insup­
portable and quite incongruous conclusion that in the fo'u -■
years between the ''dismissal of the military cha * ;es <
Respondent and his indictment, Respondent was entitled to
insist upon a prompt resolution of the charges against hln,
and the federal Government was obliged by the Sixth Amendment
to afford him a. speedy trial on those charges, despite the

This holding, v/e submit, is

i'la fly

inconsistent, not

only- with the very Ian wage or the Sixth Amendment .-.L.ich talks
about an accused in a criminal prosecution, but also with
this Court's analysis of that provision in United States . „
Marion,

in Marion, the Court held that the particular pro­

tections of the Sixth Amendment did not extend to the period
before an individual had been formally accused of a crime,
either by arrest or indictment, even though that individual
nay have been aware for an extended period of tine prior to
his indictment that he was under official investigation,
and even though he may have suffered severe, harmful emotional
and financial consequences as a result of that investigation.
It is, we believe, the logical corollary of these
conclusions that if defendant's Sixth Amendment rights also
did not continue after a criminal proceeding against him has
been terminated by a complete dismissal of the charges, at
•that point, just like in advance of formal accusation, the
individual does not stand publicly accused of any crime and
his liberty is in no way restricted,

His situation, the

Court observed in Marion, does not compare with that of a
defendant v ho has been arrested and held to answer.
how, Respondent}s only response to these arguments
is the assertion that I is
in Klopfer v,

..
, In

..

,S.

he e ew presented the question -- and I am quoting from page

17

214 of the Court's opinion — whether authorities, quote,
"may definitely postpone prosecution on an indictment without
stated justification over the objection of an accused,"
The unusual North Carolina procedure in Klopfer
allowed the fetate Prosecutor to postpone prosecution indef initely on an indictment that he did not wish to pursue immedi­
ately.

The upshot was that since the indictment was not dis­

missed during the waiting period the statute of limitations
remained tallied, and the defendant remained under forma 1 put lie
accusation and under the constant threat of prosecution at the
option r>f the Government.

This Court l:teld that the state

procedure violated .'lep er's right tc a speedy trial, but only
because, as the Court stated at page 222, the suspension of
i.ls prosecution, quote, "indefinitely prolonged the oppression
: s veil as the anxiety and concern accompanying public accusa­
tion."
Respondent, of course, was not under any public
accusation between October 1970 and January 1975.

Nothing in

But there is

no suggestion that the statute was violated here.

Moreover,

as this Court observed in'Marion and reaffirmed last term in
United Btates v. Lovasco, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth
Amendment is an additional protection against unreasonable
pre-.indictment delay,

A lengthy delay prior to accusation

violates due process if it causes actual prejudice to the
*v •

defense and.if the Government’s justification for the delay
is inadequate.
Although the Court of Appeals did not undertake this
and lysis, ue believe that the District Court and the dissentinp
, i. d.. ,e in the Cci.rt of Appeals correctly found that the Due
Process Clause was not violated in this case.
Respondent does not contend otherwise,

Indeed,

Respondent has never

claimed that the Government delay in this case was designed
to prejudice his defense or was occasioned by tactical reasons •
And, as we've, set forth at some length in our main and reply

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD L. SEGAL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SEGAL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I ask the Court’s indulgence, if I may, at the
outset.

If you will bear with me if I also pass over the

facts slightly in this case.

It just seems to me that the

Solicitor General's argument has consciously averted some
rather, I think, poignant and significant findings.

Not my

facts, if Your Honors please, but the facts found by the Court
of Appeals and the facts found in the most extraordinary
military proceeding that precipitated this ease in 1970.
The case does start on February 17, 1970, with the
murders of the MacDonald family, the wife and children.

The

wounds that Dr, MacDonald referred to, by the Solicitor, of
course, were testified to at the military proceedings by beta

20

the Government doctors and the defense doctors as being "JLifethreatening".wounds.

The reason for it. of course, was that

one of the Government's multiple theories of trying to explain
the case was that these were self-inflicted by the accused,
Dr, MacDonald, to cover up murders that he had committed.
In fact, the records fail to support that and the conclusion
of the military presiding officer in 1970 was that
Dr* MacDonald had told the truth.

Those v ere his words.

Most extraordinarily, which the 'Government has
referred to at great length, are the facts from this 1970
military proceeding that nwhere in the (Solicitor General'»
brief, nowhere in the Solicitor Generalis argument does.he

MR, SMGAL:

Yes, Mr,Chief Justice.

I might just point out that, as a matter of fact,
it was the election of a government as to which of these
two systems it might go to.

At the very outset of the case,

the investigation was being pursued by both the FBI and the
Justice Department and the military authorities.

And it was

th'ie Justice ^Department that participated in the ultimate
decision that the prosecution should be brought, initially,
in the military system rather than in the civiliar court.
If I may, though, if Your Honor please, I do want
to share with the Court

If I may then proceed to the question, though,
the .appealability of the denial of D \ MacDonald's motion
a speedy .trial prior to trial-,

it seems to me that what the

Court of Appeals did in accepting this case was neither
extraordinary or out of line with the prior decision that it
rendered itself in Lana down and, in fact,, the concepts that
were approved by this' Court originally in Cohen v. Beneficia,),
Loan Corp in 19^9 and reaffirmed by this Court in Abney.
Conceptually, they are the same.
If Your Honors plea Be, I think that the Court of
Appeals, Judge Busner, writing Cor the majority, made the
point very clear when it said:. "This is one of the small
classes of ri Its that must be reviewed in' criminal cases
pretrial."
The claim in this case is clearly collateral.

The

order in this case ~~ and I am not necessarily saying that
every order in every speedy trial case, but clearly the order
in this case — was a final order.

In its reply brief, the Government returns to a
description of the speedy trial claim and sa.ys:

"such a plea

sets up by way of defense a claim that bars conviction whether
or not the defendant is guilty.i:
And this Court, Mr. Justice White, writing for the
Court in iMaricn echoes exactly the same. language.

MR, ^JjGAL:

In view of the decision of this Court,.

Mr, Justice Stevens, in Abney. I think that speedy trial claims
are appealable as a matter of right, as being part of the
small class of criminal cases referred to in Cohen and referred
to again in Abney.
X would suggest to the Court that the bugaboo raised
that somehow we are going to open the. floodgates to a lot of
frivolo as speedy trial claims is, again, unsupported by the
facts or the rationality.
let me point out several things.

First of all, there

have been 29 years that have elapsed since the Cohen doctrine
was first articulated.

Which means that for 23 yea rs'

defendants -and defense lawyers in criminal cases apparently
are presumed to be aware that they could have sought inter1 cut or. appeals under denial of speed,

trial claims by

district courts.

May I point out, Your Honor, that, in

fact, there is no floodgate to be opened in this case because
the floodgate is opened 'already.

The truth of the matte:- is

I think in a semina l period, until the

I don’t think every speedy .trial argument, every speedy trial

The court is perfectly capable,

all courts of appeals are perfectly capable of reading the
papers and without argument determining which are without, merit'.
I have practiced, if Your Honors please, in federal criminal
courts, "or something like 18 years.

I didn't need the Cohen

case to tell me it

as unwise to take interlocutory appeals

in criminal cases.

We knew that the courts of appeals-, • we

all have experienced the courts of appeals, the filing of a

MR, SEGAL:

The difficulty.is though, Your Honor,

the finality issue.

If re are us in.. the Cohen standard, Cohen

requires there would be a finality.

In this particular case,

there was finality because the district judge entered a very
specific order and wrote an opinion.

And his opinion was that

in this case the — in order to be a speedy trial right unde."
the Six ;h Amendment there had to be a public accusation.

On

that score the judge'was right and it was upheld and that
language ..as correctly found by' the court of appeals.

But

he erred and the court of appeals found be erred when he said
the public accusation -in this c; se had not taken place until

when

Just so I make it — just so it is

b

straight, I gather now that you are saying that an order
denying a motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds is
appealable, both when the judge denies it on the grounds that
this really isn’t a speedy trial claim at all

as in this

case, I take it — or — but also if he denies it on the
ground, yes, it is a speedy trial claim, but it is without
merit.

Do you think both ard appealable?

I must confess, hr. Justice Liiite, I

did not perceive Judge Dupre's order as saying there was not
a speedy trial ~~

I know, but you seem to think that if

you say that you. measure the time in this case only after tl

Our contention — It. is the Government brie? that

That is,to accept the Government’s contention that

a case such as this one that a person who goes to trial end

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEN]

S.

I,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GELLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, end may it please

the Court:
First, X would briefly like to address the sug­
gestion that the Government somehow has been inconsistent in
the position we are taking in this case and the position we
took in Marion about whether speedy trial claims are collateral.
The threshold issue in lie rion was an appealability issue
whether the Government could appeal under the old version or
Section 3731* and that, in turn, depended upon whether the
district court's dismissal of the indictment had resolved any
issues

oi r to the general issue in the case.
Of course, a speedy trial issue is collateral to

the .Issues to be litigated at trial, in the sense that a
resolution of the Oixtn Amendment question does not require
an inquiry Into the truth, of any of the allegations in the
indictment.

But we think the Court must have meant something

more than that when it used the term "collateral" in Cohen and
-J.R9k. 1 ' else virtually any pre-trial motion to dismiss would
be collateral, os Mr, Justice Marshall stated,
be think that the Court meant that an issue is
collateral if it would be no easier to resolve the issue
af
in any

’ore.

ay by the decision on the merits of the case?

45
And speedy trial claims would be, r-.s I mentioned earlier, if
the defendant is a con'-if led, then, not only is there no need
to resolve the claim, but it goes a long way toward sug gestby
that his allegations of prejudice were insubstantial.
More importantly, if he is convicted, then the
record — the trial record — is generally indispensable
in determining whether 'or not his Sixth Amendment rights have
been violated,and no better proof of this need be offered than
that the courts of appeals almost always resolve post-convic­
ti on appeals raising speedy trial claims, by reference to the
evidence educed at trial, as, of course, this Court did in
Barber y. bInyo, in-analysing Barker's speedy trial claim,
Mow, secondly, it is true that the remedy for a
speedy trial violation is dismissal of the indictment, but
that doesn't indicate that the ..sixth Amendment creates o
.st -called .*i, h i not tc ' e tried.

- .he difficulty

ith

les pendent's reason in; , once again, is that dismissal of be
:ndict; lent is the remedy for a ride range of violations, both
constitutional and non-constitutional, such as all those
involving defects in the indictment.

If interlocutory appeals

'mere to 1 e allured in each of these cases, unde:-.* the theory
that the nature of the remedy implies a. right not to be a vied,
ti.en the collateral

.be ■ exception would swallow up the fin-

judgment rule in criminal cases.
In addition —

MR. oELLER:

That's another reason to distinguish

it, but even there re hod to shew that the Sixth Amendment
— the district court’s resolution ci uhe Sixth Amendment
question did not implicate any issues going to guilt or
innocence,

, was because there ‘was a plea

and air t ement within the ..leaning of the old Grinina 1 Appeals
Act,

to be tried is inconsistent with this Court's decision lust

Finally., I’d like to discuss the reason for the
delay- in this case, because Mr. Segal has used a large portion
of his argument trying to explain why the delay was unfair.
I think it is fair to say that much of the delay in
this case was attributable to the strong feeling on the ??rt
of many persons in the Criminal Division in the Justice
Department that charges as serious as the ones in this case
simply should not be brought unless the Government was.
absolutely convinced that they would ultimately.prove successe Ln
delay.
