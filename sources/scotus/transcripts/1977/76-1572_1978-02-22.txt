ORAM ARGUMENT OF WADE II. McCREE, JR. , SOLICITOR GENERAL
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
GENERAL MC CREE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presetns the issue whether a United
States District Judge, in imposing a sentence upon a convic­
ted defendant, may take into account as one of the factors
hi

belief that th

defendant lied under oath at the trial.

The jurisdiction of this Court is pursuant to 28
U. S. C. Scection 12i'4 subsection 1 and writ of certiorari to
the. Third Circuit.

The facts are not in substantial dispute.

The Respondent, Ted Grayson, was under confinement
i a th ?. Federal 'Prison Camp at A lien wood, Pennsylvania since

On October 11th, 1975, Mr. Grayson absented him• C i

He was apprehended two days later by agents of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation in a New York City apartment

wo ere he unit sally denied his identity and suosaqusntlv

\

acknowledged ito
He was indicted by a grand jury in November, 1S75
a month later, was tried in February, 1976 and was convicted
by a jury on February 6th, 1976»
The jury obviously rejected his defense that he
left under duress because of threats by another inmate, one
Alex

!Sarge" Barnes, to whom he claimed he was indebted to

the extent of 40 cartons of cigarettes arising out of poker
games losses.
On March 12, 1976, the sentencing judge imposed m
sentence of two years consecutive to the sentence that the
Respondent was then serving and the judge stated expressly
that the reason for his sentence — reasons for his sentence
were to deter Respondent and others from similar conduct and
secondly, and I quote, "It is ray view that your defense was a
complete fabrication without the slightest merit whatsoever."
A motion for new trial was denied.

An appeal was

duly noticed and a panel of the Third Circuit affirmed the
conviction without opinion.
Upon rehearing, the panel reconsidered the case
and in a split decision, vacated the sentence and remanded
the cr.se for resentencing, finding that the trial judge’s
corsid.eration of the Respondent's lying on the stand was in
conflict with one of its decisions, a case called Pofceet
versus Fauver and that, for this reason, the sentence was

3

tainted and could not stand.
The judge, concurring in the initial opinion, for
vacating the sentence, added the constitutional reasons that
the holding or contrary holding would penalize the right of
a defendant to take the stand, would deter other defendants
from testifying and impose punishment

for perjury, a separ­

ate or independent defense.
The dissenting opinion distinguished the Poteet
case which was thought to govern, pointing out that in Poteet,
after a jury conviction, the trial judge endeavored to cause
both convicted defendants to confess their guilt.
thens did and received a particular sentence.

One of

The other per­

sisted in his claim of innocence despite the jury's contrary
verdi(3t and the judge and the state court thereupon pronoun­
ced a considerably more severe sentence and this dissenting
opini m in our case properly pointed out that the district
judge here only sentenced him because of lying or. the stand
and not for his refusal to confess.
The dissent also observed that this was not a sen­
tence for an independent crime but merely a consideration of
the character or behavior of the defendant at the trial.
Interestingly enough, the dissenting opinion
sucrga ted two limitations on the consideration of a
mendacity at trial,
First, that the trial judge should be convinced

6

beyond a reasonable doubt of the lying under oath and second,
that the falsity of the testimony should be necessarily es­
tablished by the finding of guilt.

He had no difficulty with

either condition in this case and would have affirmed.
It is also interesting that neither of the judges
who voted to vacate the sentence had any difficulty with the
fact that the testimony was false or that it was necessarily
established by the finding of guilt or if they did, they cer­
tainly did not express it in their filed opinions.
This question has beer? considered by all the cir­
cuits and all but the District of Columbia Circuit, until
this case from the Third Circuit, had held that a trial judge
may consider the fact that a defendant lied under oath in
determining the appropriate sentence, so long, of course,
that the sentence does not exceed the permissible limits
established by statute.
This is consistent with the expression of the
C~r;gross.

In IS United States Cede Section 3577 we find the

Congressional statement and I quote it, it is brief, "No
limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the
background, character and conduct of a person convicted of an
Offense which a court of the United States may receive and
consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence."
And this statute is found in that portion of the
Code chat provides for the obtaining of a presentence report

7
as a sentencing tool available to the district judge who must .
pronounce sentence and I

emphasise the Congressional use of

the word "conduct of a person convicted" and certainly, lying
under oath at the trial is an act which might fall under the
classification of conduct and the Court, of course, witnesses
this himself and the statement that no limitation should be
placed on the information would certainly seem to legitimatize
the Trial Court's action here, unless there is some constitu­
tional reason why he may not do it.
We submit that there is no constitutional reason.
There ■— as the dissenting opinion pointed out — is no punishment for a separate or independent offense.

The offense

of perjury is a separate and independent offense but it
carries a sentence of five years and this sentence was within
the permissible limits for the sentence of escape from con­
finement and was not because — it was not an additional
penalty but merely a Consideration of an appropriate sentence
as demonstrated by the conduct of the defendant who appeared
before the Court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, if the position

of the Third Circuit were sustained and — would there be a
tendency, at least in some cases, for the prosecution to
insticute a new case, a new indictment for perjury and if
that were so, might not the defendant be worse off than
having the judge merely take if into account?

and a pro pos of this point, whether this is punishment for a

Let us assume that Respondent here had a prior
conviction for bank robbery.

Certainly, the sentencing court

could take that into consideration in formulating the sentence

!I are saying this wmie

Now, I am not suggesting that

a judge would be

dishonest about it if this Court should say that he could not
consider it, but it would certainly be a temptation not to
explicate reasons and I might observe that the Senate Bill
1437, sometimes referred to as the “Son of SI," a previous
Scisat2 bill that was proposed: in an earlier Congress that
vr.ill amount to a revision of the criminal code requires the
expli :aticn of reasons' for sentences that, apart from presump­
tive sentences that are to be established by a mechanism set
forth in that proposed legislation and this would mean that

and I can furnish it if the Court wishes.
If this is, indeed, a constitutional limitation,
if the sentencing agency may not take into consideration the
fact that a defendant lied, then a sentencing jury could not
take this into consideration, either and we would have the
a noma lous situation of

a

jar-/ rejecting a defendant’s de­

fense because it found it incredible beyond a reasonable
doubt and then having to disregard its determination in de­
ciding what disposition to make of the defendant and we sub­
mit that that kind of anomalous

situation is not good consti­

tutional sense or good common sense and that this decision of
the Third Circuit should be reversed.
If there are not other questions at this time, with
leave of Court, I would reserve the balance of my time for
rebuttal.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Solicitor

General.
Mr. Humphrey.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN M. HUMPHREY, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. HUMPHREY:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The 1949 decision of this Court in Williams versus
New York was the reflection of the concept of individualized
sex.tor.cing and that case placed a particular emphasis on the

11
need

or a sentencing judge to consider a variety of factors

which would relate to a defendant’s need for and prospects
for a rehabilitation.
Therefore, the Court held that a judge without
due process safeguards can consider such characteristics of
a defendant as past criminal conduct even if that conduct had
not resulted in a conviction,
QUESTION:

Justice Black, in that opinion, indica­

ted very clearly that hearsay could be relied upon, did he
not?
MR. HUMPHREY:,
QUESTION;

That is correct, Your Honor,

Would not the personal observation of a

judge in the courtroom be more trustworthy and material than
the hearsay information which .necessarily comas into a pre­
sentence report?
MR. HUMPHREY:

The government has contended that

this would mace the determination hv the judge more accurate,
the fact, that he was there and observed the testimony.
We would contest chat position for a variety of

reasons,

It has historically

and as this case illustrates, the particular factual

situation in this case, really, we are dealing here with a

12
conflict between the testimony of two convicted felons.
The judge happened to believe the testimony of the
government inmate witness but it is our position that — and
I will discuss this in just a moment, that in fact, the jury's
determination of guilt in this case was not at all inconsis­
tent with the defendant5s testimony.
QUESTION:

What if the — hypothetically, the pre-

sentence report showed that of 2C or more persons interviewed
by the probation officer, a dozer, of them said that this man
was unreliable, untrustworthy and known to be a man who con­
stantly dealt in falsehoods?

Could the sentencing judge take

that into accaunt?
HR. HUMPHREY:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, I believe that he could.

Under Williams..

MR,, HUMPHREY:

Under Williams.

And even under our

position in this'case because that, presumably, would be eon■

ally outside of the unique pressures of a criminal trial and
v;e think that this is a crucial difference in this case.
QUESTION,

Just what do you mean by the "unique

pressures" in the context of your sentence, a;-: you stated it
to us?
MR., HUMPHREY:
s

Well, a man. who has been convicted

"■ or, v io is guilty of a serious criminal of cense, it

would not be -surprising that this type of man would generally

13
lie and attempt to avoid the hardships of incarceration.
We think that a. criminal trial itself places a
unique pressure on a defendant.
QUESTION:

Well, one of the pressures it places on

him is that he takes an oath to tell the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth,
MR. HUMPHREY:
QUESTION:

isn't it?

That is correct, Your Honor.

Well, do you think that that cuts in

your favor?
MR. HUMPHREY:

No, we are not excusing perjury.

We are not attempting to say it is okay for a de­
fendant to commit perjury.

Perjury can be punished.

A defen­

dant who commits perjury on the stand can be charged and con­
victed for perjury.
QUESTION:

Well, then I'll out to you the question

I put to the Solicitor.

Do you think — is it in the interest

cd your client to have the government be required by this
Court to pros scute him separately for the perjury?
MR. HUMPHREY:
u'

Indeed, I think it is

■?.. ail on-, defendants that

in the inter-

.he government be required to

clung.: and to try a defendant whom they suspect of perjury.
We would have no -QUESTION:

That would be the only way — or, at

least it would be one way to discourage perjury other than
t

giving heavier sentences, wouldn't it?

14
MR., HUMPHREY:
QUESTION:

That is correct and --

Do you suggest that would be good for

defendants generally?
MR. HUMPHREY:

X would say that Mr. Grayson would

much have preferred to have been charged and been given the
opportunity to persuade a jury that he did not get convicted
of perjuryf rather than have a judge make a summary determina­
tion

no impose an additional increment of sentence without

any due process safeguard whatsoever.

I find it difficult to square that with

the idea that you concede that the Court may take into account

Well, that is not outside the context of

As a matter of fact, it is awfully close

to immediately preceding the sentence.
MR. HUMPHREY:

Well, it is not in the trial situa­

tion and in that particular case — well, cne of the problems
we have with a judge considering perjury is that it tends to
kill the right of a defendant to testify in his own behalf.
QUESTION:

Well, what you are saying is that the

Court in s. sense can take into consideration the fact that
the defendant has lied on other occasions out on the one
occasion he took an oath to tell the truth, it can't take
in o consideration the fact that he thought he lied.
MR. HUMPHREY:

That is right, because — and for

the several reasons, one, that

defendant is under unique

pressure in a criminal trial.
Two, that the consideration of

a

judge of that

factor tends to kill the right of other defendants to take
the stand and testify, even giving a truthful testimony;.

QUESTION:

/

MR,

HUMPHREYS

Well, that is the purpose of the

sente ice that indicates that the judge was sentencing him
for the purpose of deterring him. from commi ting perjury.
QUESTION:

Which is what the judge said he was
\

sentencing him to deter him from escaping„
MR,, HUMPHERY:

Well, he said that one of the rea­

sons for his sentence was deterrence but if the reason we are
sentencing is to deter defendants
then

from committing perjury,

are in fact sentencing them for the subsequent

crime of perjury.
QUESTION?.
I’r, not in this.

Well, I don’t know where you get "we."

MR. HUMPHREY:

MR. HUMPHREY;

If it was the

week before,, yes.

If it was not this particular criminal proceeding.
QUESTION:

I see.

All you want is that in this

particular proceeding- because this man is subject to perjury,
he cannot be considered for sentencing.
MR. HUMPHREY:

Well,

that is one of the reasons.

I think that there is a temptation for a judge to sentence
him or to increase, the increment of sentence because of sus­
pected perjury because he wants to either punish the indivi­
dual for falsely testifying in his court or because he wants
to deter other defendants from doing so and not —
QUESTION:•

And he can’t do it for either reason.

MR. HUMPHREY;
t

No, I don't believe he can because

7o vie, ia effect, he a sentence for the substantive
:f perjury without having been charged —
QUESTION;•

Well.- when he raises it because the

presentence report says that this man was arrested for murder
tnr&e years ago in Guam, can the judge consider there in the
sentence?
MR,, HUMPHREY:

Yes, lie can.

Williams would say

that he can.
QUESTIONWell,, how can he punish him for that

20

murder in .Guam?
MR. HUMPHREY:
QUESTION:

Not punish him.

In that case —

Well, there's a difference.

Why is it

not punishable, there?
MR. HUMPHREY:

Okay.

There are four recognised

purposes of sentencing, protection of society, deterrence,
punishment of the individual and rehabilitation.
The government has contended in its brief that in
si ht courts of appeals which have decided this issue in
favor of the government's position, all reject the concept
that this is a punishment or a sentence imposed for deterrence
and that it is for rehabilitation.
Similarly, a consideration of a" murder in Guam
th:.„ee years ago — or the charge that he murdered — would be
relevant only to the question of that defendant's need for
and prospect for rehabilitation.

Tie cannot punish him for

that.
QUESTION:

Well, I question whether — at least,

I would agree with that characterization.

I would think that

rehabilitating the

21
man for these things because moot sentencing judges do not
even mention the fact but simply because he figures this man
is a bad apple and he is a worse apple than the conviction
for this particular offense indicates.
MR, HUMPHREY:

Well, I think that that is the same

thing that. I am talking about.

You see, looking at the

character of the individual — and he says that as the result
of the fact that this guy is a bad apple as shown by his mur­
der three years ago, then he should be incarcerated for a
longer period of time because it would take a longer period
of time to rehabilitate him or he can’t be rehabilitated and
therefore we nave got to keep him in.
And Williams, when it talks about these various
kinds of sentencing factors, talks in terms of rehabilitation.

QUESTION:

Well, Williams wasn’t dealinc: with re-

viduaIs from doing likewise, I don't think it is proper be­
cause he was not charged and convicted of any crime and to
punish him or to attempt to deter others from that conduct

However, if he says that is a reflection of the

As I seid* the fact that he is not under oath may
distinguish it from the case that we have at bar here because
he would not be subject to other punishment without the
charge and conviction.
QUESTION:

Do you know whether the proposed new

criminal code touches on this question?
MR. HUMPHREY:

Well, the new proposed criminal code

in the very first section of it, sets forth the reasons for
sentences.

Section 101 subsection B says —
QUESTION:

Dees it r cuirs a statement of reasons?

MR. HUMPHREY;

Yes, it does.

QUESTIONs

Yes.

MR. HUMPHREY:

Furthermore, it states in Section

101 B4 that one of the purposes of sentencing is to promote
the correction and rehabilitation of persons who engage in
such conduct, recognizing that 'Imprisonment, is generally not
an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilita­
tion.

The whole concept of individualized sentencing has

undergone quite a reevaluation, at least here.,

defendant.
In fact, specifically,

it has a section there very similar to the statute 3577.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. HUMPHREY:

says, really, rehabilitation is not a goal that is being

served by incarceration of the defendant.
I wanted to point out at this time something about
the facts in this case, just to illustrate the problems
created by this practice.

Here is a defendant who denies that

to committed perjury and they have a jury verdict which was
not inconsistent with his testimony, despite the contentions
of tile government and the statements of the dissenting judge
in the court helow.
The defendant testified that he was heir.g pressured
by an inmate because of this gambling debt, that he left

because he was afraid of getting ki lled and he went, to his
apartment, his legal residence in New York City and wac appre­
hended by the FBI a couple of days later.
The judge, in charging the jury on this defense of
duress and coercion, stated that there must be no reasonable
opportunity for the defendant to have avoided the compulsion
without committing the crime and charged the jury that they
must apply a reasonable man’s standard.
Therefore, it is obvious that the jury could have;
said ’This man was under duress.

action he took.

He did feel that his life

A reasonable man would have gone to the

authorities at the Allen wood. Prison Camp and asked for their
protection."
QUESTION:

Mr. Humphrey, would you make the same

basic argument that you make in this

case if the -ury verdict

were inconsistent with the defendant's testimony?
MR.. HUMPHREY^
Mr

I would make the same basic argument,

Jusvice, on the constitutional point.

I think that this

case can be decided without reaching the constitutional ques­
ts XL ova that if the Court recognizes the difficulties
which this particular practice creates, I think the Court can
err re . rr its .supervisory powers over the Federal Court and
impose, for example, those ..
QUESTION:

Mr. Humphrey, supposing we had a case

in which the* defendant had not

;aken the witness stand and the

trial judge before sentencing said to his lawyer,

"You know,

if I had heard this witness •--- heard this man on the witness
stand. I might have decided the case differently on the merits"
and the lawyer had said,

"Well, he could not take the stand

because to deny the charge he would have had to tell the
truth.,"

I mean, telling the truth would have hurt him and he

did not want to lie so he stayed off the witness stand.
Could the judge take into consideration in sen­
tencing him that this man had been sufficiently interested in
veracity not to take the stand and try to defend himself
falsely?

guilty.
No, I am certainly not.

One of the

points in our argument is that those not guilty will be: dis­
suaded, perhaps, from'taking the stand and testifying in
their own behalf because of this very practice.
If an individual knows that he has got a close case
and he knows that all the judge has to do is disbelieve him
and he is going to get twice the sentence that he would nor­
mally get, that is going to weigh heavy on the minds of an
appreciable number of innocent defendants.

I have a couple of questions,

1r. SolIcitor General.
GENERAL MC CREE:

Yes, sir.

There Is, as I am sure rov. would

QUESTION:

I do.

There is

iso an absolute constitutional

right to —- for a defendant co take the witness stand in his
own defense in any criminal trial.
GENERAL MC CREE:
QUESTIONs

That is my understanding, too.

Now, if after the defendant has exercised

fc:;th of these constitutional rights and he is found guilty,
that is, he has pleaded not guilty and he has taken the stand
and ho has testified in a manner that if his testimony is
believed, he has a defense to the criminal charge so if he is
found guilty, the natural inference arises that he has lied,
does it not?
GENERAL KC CREE:
QUESTION:

It might.

That the jury has found that he has - lied,

does it not?
GENERAL MC CREE:
QUESTION;

Certainly in this case,

If his testimony is a complete defense

to the charge.

GENERAL MC CREE:

And if ths jury finds him guilty then

Mr. Solicitor General? both of you are

poker ?

how you can rehabilitate hiu and I would say that if he wants

than he is even further removed from the possibility of

redemption.
