P R O C E E D I N G S
MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll hear arguments

first; this morning in 77-10, Exxon Corporation against the
Governor of j-iaryland and the related and consolidated cases,
Mr, Simony you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM SIMON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR, SIMON:

Mr0 Chief Justice and may it please the

Courts
Appellants challenge the constitutionality of
paragraphs (H) and (C) of Chapter 854 of the Maryland Statutes,
to which I will devote 20 minutes, and paragraph (D) of the
same Statute to which I will devote 10 minutes, under the
commerce clause and the supremacy clause of the Constitution,
respectively.
Paragraph (B) of the Maryland Act provides that
"After July 1, 1974, no producer or refiner” may open a new
service station in Maryland operated by company employees.
And paragraph (C) providas -that;

After July 1,

19 75, no producer or refiner may operate an existing service
station by company employees.
As of July 1, 1974, only six percent, 233 out of
3800, of the service stations in Maryland were company
operated, and only 197 of those by refiners.

No crude oil

has ever been produced in Maryland, and it is unlikely that

5

any ever will be.
There is no refinery in Maryland, and the State's
ecology procedures are such that it, is unlikely -that -there
will be any refinery in Maryland, at least, in this century.
And thus all gasoline sold in Maryland is imported into the
State in interstate commerce and all refiner marketers in
Maryland are out-of-St&te firms.
To make the purpose of paragraphs (B) and (C) crystal
clear:

In 1975, the Legislature enacted an amendment to the

statuta, which expressly provided that all service stations
must be operated by dealers.
The statute’s legislative history, tie proceedings
in the State courts, and the briefs in this Court nil make
crystal-clear that the purpose or the statute is to insulate
major brand dealers from the competition of more aggressive,
lower-priced merchants and to insure that Mary lend motorists
and those who travel into the State will not receive the
benefits of service stations that, are company operated and
are price cutters, who sell at lower prices, and to eliminate
that competition from the service station business in Maryland.
The two alleged purposes which the Mary 1 find Court of
Appeals gave to sustain the validity of the statute are:
first, that it will prevent r monopoly, although they concede
that this service station business is highly competitive and
many Maryland as we 11 as federal laws already prohibit

6

monopolies in any line of commerce; and, secondly, that the
statute would permit the fair and equitable rationing of
gasoline in the event of emergencies, although paragraph (F)
of this very Act so provides, and in 1973 the Congress passed
the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act under which the federal
government, from that day to this, has allocated gasoline
supplies to service stations»
QUESTION;

Mr. Simon, there had been a declining

number of retail outlets in Maryland, hadn't there, at the time
this law was passed?
MR. SIMON:

Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and, as I

will point out later, the number of service stations

r*

kind and all kinds, whether or not this Act prevails, will
continue to decline because the eccnomi.cs of high prices in
gasoline going from the 25-cant range of the Fifties to the
60 and 65-cant range of currant prices makes it essential that
we have high-volume stations that can operate more economically
and net have the inefficient marginal stations.

So there will

be a diminution of stations, no matter what.
QUESTION;

You say it makes it essential, essential

from whose point of view?
MR. SIMON:

First, from the point of view of he who

wants to compete for the motorist's business; and secondly
for the motorist who wants to get the benefit of competition
in the sale of his gasoline.

7

QUESTION:

Well, so essential that it can override

Mary land poll cry on that point?
MR. SIMON: Well, as I understand the decisions of
this Court, a statute which burdens interstate commarce will
ba sustained only if the local benefits ara so persuasive and
so important as to override the restraint on interstate
commerce which they impose.

And we submit that this mere

matter of fair allocation, which is already being done by the
federal government and preventing monopoly which is already
prevented by many statutes, does not justify the restraint on
competitio:1 which this statute imposes.
And may I add, Mr, Justice Rehaquist, I don’t
suggest for one instant that there will aver come a time when
independent major-brand service station dealers will go out
of business.

The fact is there ara many people, I might add,

including me, who would rather pay

a higher price for the

extra service and the personal attention you get in a conven­
tional major-brand station.

But there are also a lot of

people who would rather forego those services and ro into a
low-priced no-service station and pump their own ge,s and save
as much as eight cents a gallon.
And what we advocate is that free competition should
prevail, that the motorist make the choice, and idle mix of
how many of each there will be will be decided by how many
people wart to go to each type of station.

8

QUESTION;

Well, you advocated before the Maryland

Legislature and they turned you down, and the question now, I
suppose, is whether you have a constitutional claim»
MR» SIMON;
QUESTION:

Exactly»
Well now, traditionally, though, have

not the price cutters — so they were called by the majors —
have not the price cutters, the sme.ll independents who just
bought their gas catch-as-catch-can, than the people who
supplied a major share of price competition in the market -—
I am not speaking of Maryland specifically, but of the
country generally»
MR. SIMON:

No, Mr» Chief Justi.ca, the motorist

may .not know it. but the large share, certainly not all of it
but over 50 percent, of the price-cutting gasoline is supplied
by integrated refiner-suppliers,
appellants in this case»

Z.shland Oil i.s one of the

Ashlaid sells under its own brand in

its home State area of Kentucky, but in Maryland it sells under
the names "Bi-Lo", "Hi'Fi", "Payless", "Redhead", names that
one would never identify with the Ashland Company, and those
stations sell on a purely price basis, saving the customer a
great deal of money»
The undisputed testimony be;lav; was that those
stations can31 operate unless the management can control not
only operations of the station but the price, because price
is their key factor»

And those Ashland stations under those

9

brand names ~~
QUESTION:

When you say the management, you mean

the man who is running the station?
MR. SIMON:

Yes, sir.

Tell them exactly how to

run it so as to achieve the economi.es of scale, and tell them
what to price.
QUESTION: Aren’t there some areas where chey buy
•die gas ax re coxy from me big companies?
MR. SIMON:

I have no doubt that that, is true, Mr.

Justice Marshall, -QUESTION:

Delivered at night.

MR. SIMON:
QUESTION;

Sir?
Delivered at night in unmarked "trucks.

MR, SIMON:

Oh, I don’t believe that there's any

secret made about it, where it occurs.
QUESTION:

That’s right.

MR. SIMON:

There is no secret about it where it

• occurs.
One of our problems i.s finding exactly just what is
a major# but there are many companies that I think everybody
would call majors who sail 50 percent of their gasoline for
resale unbranded.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. SIMON:

Is that in the record?

No, sir.

But it is in the record that

Ashland, which, has five refineries around the country, and
I

10

it is in the record that there are 37 refiners in the United
Statas who sell gasoline through service stations that they
control, and give little or no service, pump your own gasoline,
you get a low price.

Five of those people do business in

Maryland, and would be driven out of the State by this law,
and the other 32 foreclosed from Maryland,
And the best example I can give you is the Hudson
stations. There are 315 Hudson stations in the United States,
In 36 States.

Five of them in Maryland.

Hudson is shown by

this record to be one of the most vigorous price cutters in
the country.

The state, in its brief to this Court, refers

to Hudson as one of the pure independent marketers.

And yet,

since the trial of this case, Hudson has acquired a refinery,
and now that they have enhanced their position to compete,
as Mary Hudson, the president of that company, testified whan
she appeared on the stand in this case.

She said, "When I

buy that refinery, if this law is upheld, I'm going to be
*

driven from this State,"
And so you have the roost vigorous competitor in the
country in the selling of low-price, gasoline who, because she
was successful enough to integrate backwards and get a
refinery, is now driven from Maryland,
QUESTION: Well, is the State not entitled to prefer
independently operated stations to the kind of perfect model
of competition, without, violating the commerce clause?

11

MR. SIMON;

VJe say no, Mr. Justice Fehnquist, no

more than. North Carolina was entitled to prefer North Carolina
apples over Washington apples in the Hunt case.
QUESTION:

Well, Maryland isn't preferring Maryland

oil over other oil in this case.
MR. SIMON;

No, but Maryland is preferring Maryland

dealers, that the pinch on competition, the squeeze on inter­
state commerce comes at the retail level, and Maryland is
preferring the local retailers against, interstate sellers of
gasoline at retail.
QUESTION;

But are not

the local retailers

characteristically the price cutters?
MR. SIMON;

No, sir, they are the high-priced people.

The local retailer, Mr. Chief Justice, is the man
who say —
QUESTION;

Perhaps we are not on the same wav® length

in terms of what -they're called.

IBm talking about the

individual station, the independent who buys his gas wherever
h® can get it, including, as you suggest, 50 percent of the
major producers ’ output frequently goes to these independents
and it's sold without a brand name.
Nov;, do those people, selling with no brand name
except one they invent, but may sell five different kinds of
gasoline over a period of months under that name, are they not
the price cutters in Maryland, as they ar© in most other States

12
MR. SIMON:

I can't: answer your quescion yas or no,

Mr. Chief Justice, because -the people that you obviously think,
as you drive down the street, as an individual station who is
a price cutter, is more likely than not a part, of a large
chain.

For example, I would assume that you would never have

thought that a Bi-Lo station or a Redhead station on New York
Avenue here, just beyond the bridges, is a station owned by
Ashland Oil, which is a very large company and has hundreds of
stations around the country under various names, soiling
low-priced gasoline with minimum service.
And what this Act is designed to drive out of
Maryland is those people who are the majority of what you had
describe-1 as the independents.
they are chains of independents.

They are independents, but
And what the Act is designed

to protect is the major-brand dealer who sells at four to
eight cents a gallon above these price cutters., selling his
well-advertised brand, fixing your tire, changing your spark­
plugs, giving you many oilier services, and, because of those
services, feeling that he*s entitled to a higher price.
But those are the local people who have the local
political inf Italics that permitted *— that resulted in this
statute being passed.
QUESTION:

And the
Well, why is Shell appealing here?

I

mean, Shell strikes me as a prototype of the kind of person
that you say would be protected by this Act.

13
MR, SIMON;

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, it can. be argued

that Shall, that I represent, aid Exxon and their like, would
short-term be bane fitted by driving out -these large chains of
price cutterso

And I think in one sense they would.

They would also be disadvantaged, because it's
important to them to be able to innovate with new types of
stations, automated stations and many other kinds of stations
that ars new and innovative.

But the real reason that Shell

and Exxon and the likes of then oppose this statutes is that
this industry is over-regulated now.

There is relatively

little area of competition left, and what competition remains,
we want to preserve» Because we can live with vigorous
competition, but if regulation gets to the point where there

survive as a free enterprise company and we’ll have public
utility regulations»
QUESTION; Do you think the State of Maryland would
b© prohibited by the commerce clause from making the selling
of gasoline a State monopoly?
QUESTION: As Virginia does with liquor?
MRo SIMON:

Yes, sir»

I hadn’t thought of that

question, Mr, Justice Rshnquist, but I would say that they
would be.
QUESTION:
with liquor?

They couldn’t do what Virginia has done

14
MR. SIMON;

I think not, in my — liquor is a

particularly different question, because the amendment which
repealed the Volstead Act gave the States a great deal of
power over local distribution of whiskey.

Indeed, the

Constitution, under that — I forget the amendment, but it's
the amendment that repealed the Eighteenth Amendment? even
gives them the power to have local option with one county
prohibitin ; sale altogether, and another county permitting it
only at tables, and another county at State monopolies.
And so I think that the) liquor situ aid. on would not be applicabis

limit Raymond Transport to 55-foot transports»
Now, -there isn’t any question they could us© 55-foot
transports to go through Wisconsin»

Wisconsin didn't say

"you’ve got to stay out of the stats"»

But this Court said

it was a burden on interstate commerce to tell then they
couldn't go through Wisconsin with 65-foot transports, or
anything over 55-foot, because Wisconsin was unable to show
any local benefits that outweighed hhs restraint of the
economies of operation .and the -QUESTION: Well, let r:_

MR. SIMON:

It just —

It burdens interstate commerce,

Justice White, in two ways:

Mr.

one, it prevents sn out-of-State

refiner from operating a retail gasoline station
QUESTION:

And selling direct to the consumer.

MR. SIMON:

And selling direct to the consumer.

And, secondly, it denies the consumer the bon©fits
of competition furnished to him by out-of-State refiners.
Let me give you the most ridiculous example.

Under

this law, Sears, Roebuck will continue to be perfectly free
to have a gasoline station in conjunction with a Sears,

18

Roebuck store selling gasoline at retail.

But Montgomery

Ward will be prohibited from having the identical facilities .
Because Montgomery Ward is a subsidiary of Mobile Oil Company,
and therefore Montgomery Ward can’t', have that retail station
in front of their store, but Sears, Roebuck can.
QUESTIONS

But the commerce clause isn't basically

to protect consumers, it's to prevent barriers erected by one
State to people who want to do business in it on the same
terms as people who are already there.
MR. SIMON:

Exactly, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I

couldn't have said it better.
We want to do business in, Maryland at retail on the
same basis as in© local retail dealers.
we want.

That's exactly what

We want to do busivirs ir retail on the same basis

that they do.

And this Act says we

can't, do it.

QUESTION: Well, all you have to do is sell your gas
to an independent retailer.
MR. SIMON:
retail.

Oh, but then we can't do business at

It denies us the right to sell gasoline at retail

to motorists.
QUESTION:

Well, critical to your argument, then,

is that selling gasoline at. retail to motorists in Maryland
is a matter of concern to interstate commerce?
MR. SIMON;

Yes, Mr. Justice White, because —•

QUESTION;

Within the meaning of the constitutional

19

clause»
MR» SIMON: And having in mind that: there are no
refineries in Maryland, it's all out-cf-State gasoline, having
in mind that these refiners, like 7,shland, sell a very
substantial part of their refinery runs of gasoline through
their own retail stations on a basis of low price, and they
outsell these major-brand dealers four and five to one, because
of their low prices» And this law would say, "You’ve got to
get out of the Stats, end you either close down that station
or lease it to someone, and have no control over the manner in
which he operates.65
And w© say that's a restraint on interes tats commerce,
exactly like in Pike vs» Bruce Church, exactly like in Hunt vs.
Washington Apple, exactly like in Raymond Transport vs» Rice,
exactly like in Cottrell vs„ A&P, all very recent cases of
this Court, all to the same effect.
Now, if I may, I would like to switch to paragraph
(D) of the statute, which w© attack on the bases of its being
repugnant to and frustrating Sections 2 (a) and (b) of the
Robinson-Patman Act»
QUESTION:

I take it your only attack on the sections

you've been talking about is the burden on interstate commerce?
MR. SIMON:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
You're not claiming a privilege and

immunity to be able to seel at, retail if Maryland people can

20
sell at retail?
MR. - SIMON:

No,

No, Mr. Justice White.

QUESTION: Well, one of the appellants is relying on
the due process clause of
MR. SIMON:

Yes.

Continental relies on the due

process clause, but I believe, Mr. Justice Stewart — and
their basis is that, as to (C) which applies to stations
already in existence.

They say, "If you don't want us to

build any snore, we can live with that; but if you want us to
tear down our existing stations, that deprives us of due
process."

That is, I think, another way of saying

what I have said under the commerce clause.
QUESTION:

But —

But it is another argument under the

— under a different provision of the Constitution?
MR, SIMON:

Yes, it is, Mr* Justice Stewart.

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Simon, we've been

taking up & good deal of your time, {Jid perhaps we” 11 do the
same with your friends, we will enlarge the time for ten
minutes for you, and that will enable the Attorney General
to give his colleague equal time, if he wishes to; you will
each have an additional ten,
MR,, SIMON: Thank you, sir,
On paragraph

(D), the Maryland statute provides

21
that: if a supplier reduces his price tio one customer, one
dealer customer, he must grant that price reduction to every
dealer in the State» And that means if you have a competitive
controversy in Baltimore, which requires you to reduce your
price in Baltimore, you must make timt price reduction
throughout the entire State of Maryland.
And wa believe that to require & supplier to make a
Statewide price reduction, if he grants a local, individual
price .reduction, is contrary to the pro-competitive rights

which thus Court has ..elc*

^nas unoer SecLxon

(b)

of tile Robinson-Pafcman Act to meet competition in individual
competitive situations, and must therefore be invalidated
under the doctrine of Perez vs. Campbell and Jones vs■ Rath
Packing Company»
The Act, Section (D) , also is in conflict with
Section 2(a) of the Robinson-Patmar.. Act, which makes unlawful
price discriminations only v/here vbny injur® competition.
This requires the Statewide lowering of price without regard
to injury to competition»

And Section 2(a) makes unlawful a

primary lino price cut, which injures a competitor of the
seller, 'which is likely to be triggered and caused when we
reduce, our price Statewide and thereby extend a Baltimore
price war to Cumberland, Maryland, let’s say, where there had
been no price war previously»

Well, contrary to 2(b) of tee Robinson-

Patman Act, but the basic philosophy of the Robinson-Patman
Act is very similar.

It also is ar. anti-competitive statute.

I don't like it at all, but I don't see the inconsistency.

24

MR. SIMON:

But# Mr0 Justice Stevens,, I'm sure you

know til at this Court has many times sought to balance the
anti- competitive problems of Robins on-Patman with the Sherman
Act# and this Court's opinions in Robinson-Patman have sought
to strike a fine balance between the anti-competitive aspects
of one and tile» pro-competitive aspects cf the other.

And

everything this Court has done in that regard is wiped out
by Marcyland# by saying# "We just aren't going to have
competition in this Stata in the sale of gasoline.

We're

going to have one price.”

sold at 75 cents a gallon in our State# period.

Would that

be unconstitutional?
MR. SIMON:

Oh# I think so.

I think that's exactly

what this Court said in Mr. Justice Burton's opinion in the
first Standard Oil case# that it would not construe RobinsonPatman as permitting.

The Court said in the first Standard

Oil case that Robins on-Patman was intended to protect
competition not competitors# that Robins on-P atman was intended
to promote competition not prevent competition# that RobinsonPatman would not require a seller to ruinously lose his
biggest customer because he couldn't meet the competition#
and then be forced to raise his price to remaining customs»3
to make up for that volume.
You will recall there are many discussions in Mr.

25

Justice Burton's opinion, there, in which he says, "We don't
construe the Act as a congressional intent to eliminate this
competitiono"

How, you see, Congress —

QUESTION:

Well, you're saying that although

Congress says you don’t violate 'the Robinson-Patman Act if
you lower your price to meet the price of -the competitor,
you're saying that a State may not have a contrary rule?

A

State may not say that "you may not lower your prices to meet
the price of a competitor"?
MR, SIMON:

Are you suggesting that?

Yes, I believe, as I say, that frustrates

the congressional intent —
QUESTION:

Well, it was just saying — all Congress

has said is thatyou don’t violate the Robinson-Patman Act if
you do that»
MRo SIMON:

But the Robinson-Patman Act represents

Mr, Justd.ce White, a congressional policy.
OUESTDiON:

It doesn't say,Robinson-Patman doesn't

say you have to»
MR» SIMON;

No, sir, but —

QUESTION;

Well ~

MR» SIMON:

— but in 2(b) this Court —

QUESTION:

And the State just says you can»

MRo SIMON:

But in 2(b) this Court has held that

Congress gave sellers an absolute right to reduc® their price
to meet competition»

26

QUESTION: Well, a minute ago you said how RobinsonPatman had been so tampered by the Sherman Act., and now you
say it's a fundamental congressional policy»
MR» SIMON: Well, I don't suggest for a minuta that
this Court has amended the Robins on-Patman Act in any of its
decisions.

What I said to Mr. Justice Stevens was that in

interpreting -the Robins on-P atm an Act, this Court has consis­
tently tried to reconcile it with the Sherman Act, and to give
it that construction which would permit both to live side by
side.

And that national policy, which is reflected in the

Robinson-Patnan Act, guarantees one the right to reduce his
price In individual cr:;.prbibiv_ clhuriicnc — .rtth the Itwer
price of a competitor, which this statute would take away from
him»
QUESTION:

It simply says he doesn't violate the

Robins on** P atnan Act if he does that.
MR. SIMON;

Yes. And -that is a statute which repre­

sents congressional policy and which the State of Maryland,
we say, cannot enact a lav/ under this supremacy clause -to
deprive us of the rights given by the Robinson-Patman Act.
QUESTION:

Well, you say, then, ‘the Robins on-Patman,

which the Court has viewed as kind of an. intrusion on the
Sherman Act, nonetheless preempts the field when it comes to
S tats legisl&fcion.
MR.. SIMON;

I would not go so far as to say the Court

27
has viewed it. as an. intrustion»

I know that what Hr. Justice

Stevens was referring to was that many commentators have said
the Acts are inconsistent»
far»

nut this Court has never gone that

And all that I can say this Court has done is say that,,

"we* re going to construe Robinson-Patman consistent with the
policy of promoting competition»"
And I say that is federal policy which is frustrated
by this Maryland statute»
QUESTION:

Mr» Simon, let me put it this way: —

because I’m slightly confuse *— are you arguing that there is
a constitutional right to engage in conduct that is protected
by the 2(b) defense?
MR» SIMON; Well, I think the short answer is yes;
a little longer answer is that under the supremacy clause of
the Constitution we say that the. State of Maryland cannot
deprive us of a competitive right which the Congress has granted
under 2(t), which this Court in 1951, in Standard Oil, said
was an absolute defense to a eh

r: of price discrimination,

no matter how serious the results — the harm and the injury
were that it caused,
QUESTION; Well, it just seems to me that you're
arguing that there is a constitutioual right to engage in
something that’s protected by a 2(b) defense»

I'm not sure

that that follows, but maybe I misunderstood your argument»
MRo SIMON;

Well, I think, Mr» Justice Blackmon, we

28
haves exactly the problem that was in Perezf where 'the Bankruptcy
Act said that if you go through

you’re discharged in

bankruptcy, you don't owe anybody any money any more»

And

the State of Arizona which says if you have a judgment against
you for negligence in operation of an automobile, you may
not get a driver's license until you pay that judgment..
And th5.s Court held,in Perez, that the Arizona, law
was unconstitutional because it conflicted with the federal
Bankruptcy Law which said that once you've gone through
bankruptcy, you didn't owe the money»

QUESTION: Would you mind if I went back to your
first argument just for a moment?
MR, SIMON:
QUESTION:

No, sir,
I take it the Maryland lav/ does not

30
chain, of service stations, to operate in Maryland.
MR. SIMOH:

As introduced, it did.
Yes, but it doesn't now.

MR. SIMON:

And the wholesalers have a --

QUESTION:

Well, let's assume •— well, however it

came about, let's assume I have a wholesaling chain of
service stations, -Che headquarters are in Pennsylvania, and
they buy their

gasoline from producers or refiners and have

their own delivery system, and outside the State, into
Maryland, they have a string of stations in Maryland.

Nov;,

that's not forbidden by this?
MR. SIMON: So long as you do not integrate backward
and buy a little refinery, you are not.
QUESTION: So it’s a discrimination against producers
and refiners, it's not a —• it can't be — why does it become
a burden on interstate commerce?
MR. SIMON:

Because —

QUESTION;

All that kind of commerce is going to —

MR. SIMON: Because “the record shows that it is the
out-of-State refiners who produce Idle competition in tbs
marketplace in Maryland, and that it is that vary competition
which the Legislature sought to eliminate to protect the
high-priced major-brand dealers, so they wouldn't have to
compete with these lower-priced people.
QUESTION;

Well, interestata -- the Constitution

31
doesn't; say that every burden on competi.felon is bad, it; says
they — it forbids burdens on interstate commerce.
MR. SIMON:

Yes, sir, but; I can only say, Mr. Justice

Whits, that this burden is far greater than that one in Hunt,
or in Raymond Transport or in Cottrel1 or in the Bruce case,
the cantaloupe case in Arizona.

There is far greater restraint

on competition here than in any of those cases.
QUESTION: Well, but they weren't — they didn't turn
on competition, they turned on commerce, didn't they? The
movement of
MR. SIMON: Right.

But in each of those cases the

restraint on commerce was much less than that hare.

In the

Rice case last week, as I say, all it required is that the
fellow runs a smaller truck, it didn't say he couldn't run
through there, it just says ha's got to use a 55-foot truck
going through there.
QUESTION:

But, in the long run, the same amount

of gasoline is going to come in and out of

into Maryland, isn't it?
MR. SIMON: But it's going to cost •die Maryland
motorists a lot more money, a lot more money.

Well, that may be.

Do you happen to recall if during the -- back in, I

think, either the Thirties or the Twenties, when a lot of
States were enacting legislation prohibiting chain stores from

industry,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS B. BURCH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. BURCH:

I 'chink -chat: Mr. Justice Relinquish and Mr. Justice
White have really hit the ne.il on the head.
case of any burden on interstate commerce.

This is not a
The Maryland

statute simply says that an independent refiner, marketer may
not operate at retail.

That’s all it says.

It doesn’t say

anything about gas going into or out of Maryland.

The same

amount of gas is going to come into Maryland, whether the
company-operated store operates or not.
QUESTION: Well, are you suggesting that engaging in
business at retail is not commerce?
MR. BURCH:

No, I am not suggesting it’s not

commarce, I’m just simply saying that it certainly comes to
rest when the gas conies into Maryland.
It may still be in commerce, in the sansa that you
go til rough commerce from the very beginning, right up to the
noasle.

But it is not a burden on commarce, it is not

commerce within the sense that decisions in this Court have
addressed itself to.
As a matter of fact, both the lower court in this
case and the Court of Appeals of Maryland have found that there
is no burden on commerce, and indeed said teat if -there is
any burden at all it is purely speculative, and is so
minimal and so infinitesimal as really not to have any burden
on commerce 'whatsoever.
Now, I want to go to, if I may, remarks that Mr.

34
Simon made wish respect, to tile background of this Act.

It is

far deeper than he would have this Court believe.
Back in 1973, we had a very serious problem with the
allocation of gasoline during the gas shortage.

The company-

owned stations were getting all of the gas that they needed.
The independents were not getting the gas.

There was one

chain of independent stations, I think by the name of Midway,
because it was relying upon the spot market, which is the
gasoline that is delivered either by the majors or by the
independent refiners to those who are in the marketplace in
competition with them.

They didn't give them the allocation of

gas to which they were otherwise entitled, as they had in tile
past.

They saved it all for themselves.
They saved it first for their company-operated

stores, and then, after that, for their independent dealers.
QUESTION;
MR. BURCH:

Mr. Attorney General -They saved it for their company-

operated —
QUESTION;

Mr. Attorney General, supposing that

Maryland noticed -that the Hudson Company, for example, had
gotten a very large share of gas when it was in short supply,
could they pass a statute and say that Hudson should not be
permitted to operate in the future because in the past they
got too much gas?
MR. BURCH;

Because of what, sir?

35

QUESTION: Because in the past: they got too much gas
when it, was in short supply*
MR. BURCH:

You might say there's an area of

discrimination there*
QUESTION: Would that justify — pardon me?
MR. BURCH:
discrimination there.

You might approach a possible area of
But 'this is not the situation we had in

Maryland.
QUESTION: Well, that's what I thought you w@r@ saying*
I thought you were saying these people got too much gas in 1973,
so we won't let them do business her© any more.
MR* BURCH:

No, they were saying -—. they had

control over the aberration of the truly independent.

Because

they are the ones who supplied them the gasoline. The
independent doesn’t have the refiner.

The only place he can

get his gasoline is either from the majors or from the
independent refiner marketer»

He can. either buy it

wholesale, or h© can buy it in the spot market.

at

If he buys

it in the spot market, it then becomes the cheapest price
that that gasoline will be sold at the wholesale level.

Much

cheaper in many instances than ‘the majors themselves, or the
independent refiners will be able to sell it to their dealer
operators„
QUESTION: Well, all I'm questioning is what is the
relevance to this allocation problem?

You don’t have gas

36

In short supply now, do you?
MR- BURCH:

The relevance is that I was getting

myself to the point of saying that because of this the Governor
of -the State of Maryland, trying to determine whether there
was truly a shortage of gasoline in Maryland, as had been
alleged, asked the Comptroller of the State to do an analysis,
to do research on the subject and send out questionnaires»
When the Comptroller did that, he went into other areas, indeed,
dealing with pricing, the price controls, the price fixing®
And as a result of that he prepared a report which was sub™
mitfaed to the Governor®
He also sent out questionnaires to the major oil
companies and the independent

refiner marketers, and again

asked them with respect to the practices.

On the basis of all

that information that came in, he then submitted it to the
Governor, and the Governor then had — he recommended that the
Comptroller had a bill prepared to correct the situation:
on©, to maintain competition in the marketplace? and, two, to
provide for appropriate allocations•
The Legislature held hearings, there were approximately 15 witnesses, there was a hearing in the Senate, there
was a hearing in the House.

About half of the witnesses were

from the industry and the other half were for others who said
that, in effect, -the Act was good, where the industry said -the
Act was bad

37

After that:, and after the Senate passed this bill
without a single dissenting vote, and after the House passed
the bill by a clear majority, before the Governor signed the
bill, because of the complaints of the industry, he said,
"I will have something that I very rarely ever do, I will
hav© another hearing", and h© sat there and had a hearing with
again about 15 witnesses that came in, and they addressed
themselves to the problem.
And the Governor was' persuaded, as was idle
Legislature, that in order to prevent the problems with respect
to allocation in the State of Maryland, and in order to prevent
the problem with respect to pricing in the State of Maryland,
it was desirable that the bill be enacted into law, and he
signed the bill.
Now, if, indeed, there is any contact with commerce
whatsoever within the framework of this case, all we have to
do is look at Raymond, which was decided a

week'ago today,

and all w© have to do is look at the Brotherhood case and the
Pike case, and all of the cases, and the ona thing that comes
out clearly with respect to those cases is, as the Court said
in its concurring opinion in Raymond, if

safety justifications

are not illusory, if they are not illusory, -the Court will
not second-guess legislative judgment about their importance
in comparison with related

burdens on interstate commerce.

A suggestion has been made, well, there are other’

3S
ways of solving this problem,
QUESTION;

Well, Maryland isn't: advancing a safety

jus'fcificahion here, is it?
MR. BURCH;

I don't think it makes any difference.

I think what the Court has said and what the opinion said in
this

tli© concurring opinion in affect said was that the

same rule applies here as we have always enunciated it, as
we enunciated it in Pike and Bruce, as w© enunciated it in the
Brotherhood case; and -that is, unless there is an illusory
reason given, which does have a punitive effect in so far as
the local community is concerned, unless it is completely
illusory and unless there is a tremendous burden on commerce,
we would not substitute our judgment for that of -the
Legis lature.
QUESTION;

Well, you wouldn't suggest for a moment

there's not an, effect on interstate commerce?
MR. BURCH;

I would say if it has any effect

whatsoever, and I think tee Court of Appeals in the —
QUESTION; Well, I know, but you wouldn't say there
isn't any effect?
MR. BURCH;

It is so minimal that it is hardly

worth talking about.

MR. BURCH;

QUESTION: Do you -chink that, they could preempt
this law of Congress by

commerce?
MR. BURCH: I have serious reservations in a situation
such as £h£s, because there is not that significant amount of
commerce.
QUESTION: Do you think Congress could regulate the
sales of gas at retail, the price?
MR. BURCH s

MR. BURCH:

QUESTION:

Well, clo you suppose — what do you have?

Do you have 3,000 — how many gas stations are there?
MR0 BURCH;
QUESTION:

There are about 35, 36 hundred,
Thirty-six hundred.

Supposing Maryland

passed a statute that says "we will only have a thousand gas
stations from now on”; would that burden commerce?
MR. BURCH

I'm not sure that it would,

QUESTION: Suppose it said a hundred?
Supposing it said the price of gas would be ten
dollars a gallon, would -that burden commerce?
MR, BURCH;

I -think it would reach a point when it

becomes so —
QUESTION: So anti-competitive, that it affects the
flow of commerce.
MR. BURCII;

And reaches the point where it would

affect the gas coming into the Stats, that then it becomes a
true burden on commerce.
QUESTION;
MR. BURCII:

Isn’t it almost inevitable —•
It's a matter of degree, and that's what

this Court has said.
QUESTION:

Isn't it almost inevitable that if you

get the price high enough you will restrict the flow, restrict
the quantity that comes into the state?
MR. BURCH;

Yes, but 1 don't want this Court ‘to --

QUESTION; Well, unless you assume that the demand is

[Laughter. 3
QUESTION: The history in. the last three years shows
that til© demand for gasoline is pretty close to it.
QUESTION:

But not totally inelastic, I don’t think.

MR. BURCH: I wouldn’t want this Court to have, the
impression from what has been said here today that because of
the Maryland statute the price of gas is going to go up to
the consumer.

Quite to the contrary, the —

QUESTION:

But isn’t it perfectly clear that if you

make it illegal to cut prices in individual situations, the
price level is going to stay higher than it otherwise would?
MR„ BURCH:

It is not sc.

Under (B) and (C) — and

Mr. Wilson will address himself to subsection (D), dealing
with the Robins on-Patman Act and the voluntary allowances.
But under (B) and (C) it doesn’t have anything to do with
what th© pries of gasoline will be, except that it assures a
free market, or insures a free market.
QUESTION; But doesn’t the record — doesn’t the
stipulated record show that there"s vigorous competition
anyway?
MR. BURCH: There!s vigorous competition up to a point.
Th© independent marketer refiners are what they call proved
efficient refiners*

They rely upon the major oil companies to

42
get; their crude petroleum in order to refins it.

And tile

major oil companies have an economic control over them®

If

they get out of line by raising their prices# or cutting
their prices four# five# six or seven cents# all of a sudden
they’re going to find that their crude petroleum supplydries up and they'r© not going to get the crude in order to
refine it and in order to sell it in the marketplace.
The differential is not four# five# six or sevent
cents# as Mr® Simon said# I think the record will indicate that
fch© differential among the independent refiner marketers in
th© marketplace in Maryland is between 1.7 and 2.2 cents per
gallon. And they maintain that# they stabilis©

th© market.

What did -fch© independent, refiners do in Maryland within 'the
past five years?
I’ll tell you what they did®

They used their

comp any -operatad stations to control the price®

They had it

under price control® They also became involved in relative
price fixing# with respect — at least one of them did#
Crown Central Petroleum — with respect to the dealers and
not comp any-ope rated stores# but th© dealers that were handling
their product,

And had it not been for -fch© fact that th©

dealers ware involved# it would never have been picked up
that Crown Central# Ashland# Kayo# PMC# and all of them were
engaged in a horizontal pricing conspiracy in order to maintain
& stabilized level of pricing so that they wouldn't b© cutting

each other up,
And the District. Court for 'the United States District
Court of Maryland found each and every one of them, other than
Continental, I believe, and Crown Central Petroleum, found
them guilty of horizontal price fixing and fined them the
maximum fine* 17 billion -*>
QUESTION*'Was this statute — is this statute in
the. form of legislative punishment for what the industry did?
MRo BURCH;

No»

Our Act was passed before the

Legislature — I think before they were found guilty of the
horizontal price fixing,.
But I'm simply saying

17 billion gallons of gasoline

had arbitrary pricing because of the horizontal price
conspiracy which was made effective through the vertical
pries control, through the stations0
Also, what does the effect of the statute have?
QUESTION; Well, Mr, Attorney (General, 1st me b© sure
I understand your argument»

Thera are how many company-owned

stations in the — I mean, how many refiner and producer-owned
stations in the State?
Something like four or five percent, wasn't it?
MR. BURCH:

I would say 205, 210, somewhere in

there.
QUESTION:

Out of 3500»

And those are the ones

that fix the prices for the whole market; is that what you're

I

44
saying?
MR» BURCH; Some ■ of them do and some of them don't.
Many ©£ them don * t set —•
QUESTION;

But your argument# to be relevant to this

statute# you have ‘to be saying# in effect# that that small
percentage of ‘the stations is able to fix the price of the
entire market»
MR» BURCH; But —
QUESTION;

Otherwise it doesn’t really relate- to

the legislative solution to the problem.
MRo BURCH;

But let me tell you what happened»

You

have to understand how they operated„
Let’s take an Exxon station that has a dealer over
here-

An independent dealer.

They're’hot supposed to be

subject to the will and the whim and th© fancy of the suppliers,
no# because if they do 'they violate the antitrust laws„
?????

They

travel with th© TVA and they're not going to get caught.
So they violate th© antitrust laws.
Now# what Exxon does with its company-owned station#
t

*?
O '?•?'?
•€> • O

it takes in all stations in what they call an alert# and it,
puts it across tee street.

Now# if fee independent dealer gets

involved in price cutting which is going to spread out in tee
community# which is going to be for the benefit of the
consumer, all Exxon has to do now is take its company-operated
store alert# reduce tee price by five cents, which in effect

45
puts th© squeeze on the dealer across the street, which is the
Exxon dealer, who is really -the one who should be -making the
market»

So what they do is, this prevents them from

disciplining by eliminating the company-operated store, it
prevents the majors and the independent marketer refiners from
disciplining th© independent dealers and other people in the
marketplace, because they're the ones that ar© relied upon
for their supply»
QUESTIONs

But your purpose, your over-all purpose,

I take it, is just to prevent the independent dealer from
being undersold? to protect him from competition?
MR» BURCH;
QUESTION;
MR» BURCH:

Ho, it not only
Isn't that the over-all purpose?
It's not necessary to protect him from

competition, that’s not th© point, Your Honor»
QUESTION:
MR» BURCH:

What is it?
Th© point is that what it does is it

gives true independence to that retail dealer, it lets him
get out and say, "I can qserata

my station more effectively

than you can, because I'm willing to work 16 hours a, day,
where you have to pay a man on -the basis of two shifts of
eight hours a day»

I'm willing to get out and work later

tonight, I'm willing to k©ep my station open all the time»
I'm willing to do this and sacrifice that, because I, as an
independent businessman, have the opportunity to make my own

46

living.

I may decide now that I'm going to reduce the price

if there’s a margin of eight center a gallon,, that I'm willing
to reduce my price by four cents a gallon."
QUESTION: Well, why didn't they prevent the retail

the one you just; referred ho, in Maryland,
MR, BURCH:

Right,

One of tlie other things that

gav© rise to concern by the members of the Legislature and by
the Governor was the fact that on® of the large majors, BP
Oil, which is owned, I think, by SOIIIO, has embarked upon a
program of converting all of its dealer-operated stations to
company-operated stations.

And Crown Central Petroleum, I

think, was about to do the same thing; in fact they went into
the State of Virginia, that did not have a lav/ such as
Maryland, and they converted all of -chair dealer-operated
stations to company-operated stations.

And in effect they

put the dealers out of business in so far as their company
was concerned.
And what is the problem with respect to that,?
The problem is that there are fewer people who can
determine whether or not there’s horizontal price fixing,
with a net-end result that the prices are going to go up
because the majors get together and the independent refiner
marketers get together and they can establish a, price in the
marketplace which is anti-competitive.
Thank you,

Mr, Wilson,

50

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. WILSON, III,, ESQ„ ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. WILSON:

Mr0 Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
The purpose of paragraph (D) is to proscribe a
practice known in the oil Indus try as granting of voluntary
allowances.

This practice was seen as an evil because it

causes injury to intra-brand competition among retail service
station dealers0
A voluntary allowance is a localized discount, which
may always be identified by three constant factors:

first,

it is always granted in response to an individual competitive
situation? second, it is naver granted in responsa to a lower
price actually offered by a de&l©r by another oil company?
and, third, it always injuras intra-brand competition.
Now, Mr. Simon has stated that the Maryland
statute requires that on© tank-wagon price be granted in
Maryland to all gasoline dealers.

This is not correct.

If a price reduction can be given to one or more dealers, in
such a way that it does not injure intra-brand competition,
it misses on© of the factors of being a voluntary allowance.
And because it misses that factor, it is not a voluntary
allowance, and need net be granted uniformly.
For instance, if Exxon had a dealer in Baltimore and
it wanted to give Exxon a voluntary allowance, and it said to

51
itself, "If I do til at, I'm going to run afoul of the Maryland
Act, and I'd have to give this voluntary allowance to everyone
in Maryland”, rather than doing that, "I will take the less
restrictive alternative and give that voluntary allowance, or
now that price reduction, to all dealers in competition with
that one Baltimore dealer? in that way I would not injure
intra-brand competition among those dealers, and because of
that I would not have a voluntary allowance and I would not
run afoul of paragraph (D) „15
I think it's important to remember that the purpose
of paragraph (D) is to get rid of this practice, not to male©
it Statewide»
Now, four of th© appallants have ~
QUKSTION;

Mr» Wilson, is th© term "voluntary

allowance” defined in idle statute?
MR» WILSON;

It is not defined in the statute, Mr»

Justice Stevens, but it is defined by the Court of Appeals»
Wow, the Court of Appeals literally defined "voluntary
allowance" as the situation which this Court said was bad in
its 1963 Sun Oil case.

The Court of Appeals never added the

additional words "which lower price is enabled by his supplier",
but it's certainly implicit in the Court of Appeals decision
that this was the situation that it had

in mind, because it

felt that it had to go on and answer the question that this
Court left open in Sun Oil.

52
We chink it also implicit in the Court, of Appeals
decision that- injury to intra-brand competition is an absolute
necessity, to have it be a voluntary allowance.
this for several reasons <,

I would say

One is that the Court of Appeals

states that the purposes of the Robinson-P atman Act are
identical with the purposes of paragraph (D).

Unguestionably

the purposes of the Robinson-Patman Act are to prevent intra­
brand injury, intra-brand competitiveness„

This is the same

as the purpose of paragraph (D)„
The other factor is that the Court of Appeals says
that a voluntary allowance in effect is whatever it is known
to the oil companies to be.

Now, there's one ‘tiling for

sura, and I don’t think Mr® Simon would argue this, a voluntary
allowance is what an oil company says it needs to get away
from violating Section 2(a) because it needs a 2(b) defense
and if it doesn't get the 2(b) defense it has a 2(a) violation®
If -that is the case then it has caused injury to
intra-brand competition or it wouldn't have viola-bed 2(a) in
the first place, because the injury to competition is a
requisite of section 2(a) liability®
Now, four of *the appellants have challenged paragraph
(D), the constitutionality of it on two grounds.

First, on

the grounds that it conflicts with the Robinson-Patman Act,
and second, ~™
QUESTIONs

Mr. Wilson, could I stop you a minute to

53

be sure I understand your argument?
MR. WILSON;

Yes, sir.

QUESTION; Are you saying that if one dealer, one
brand, has four or five stations in an area, and it treats
those four or five stations alike, so there's no injury to
intra-brand competition, it could grant a voluntary allowance
because it wouldn't — you don't have to worry about injury
to the competition of dealers buying competing brands of
gasoline?
MR. WILSON:

Well, Mr. Justice Stevens, are you

talking about under the federal statute or the State statute?
QUESTION:

I'm talking about under the Maryland

s tatute.
MR. WILSON;
QUESTION:

Under the Maryland statute, -I thought you were saying that

would not

be a voluntary allowance.
MR. WILSON:

It would not be a voluntary allowance,

that's a localized price reduction which fits the first two
prongs of the definition of voluntary allowance, but doesn't
get the third, because it doesn't injure intra-brand competition.
Therefore, the Maryland statute is not concerned with it.
That is something -that the oil company can do under
section 2(a) of the Robinson-Patman Act without needing a
s e ction 2(b) de fens &.
Similarly, it: can do it in Maryland without worrying

54
about, paragraph (D) .
QUESTION;

The purposes of the Act are synonymous,
How, where do you say you get this

construction of paragraph (d) , from the opinion of the Court
of Appeals?
MR. WILSON:

From the opinion of the Court of

Appeals„
QUESTION: Because paragraph (D) doesn't say any­
thing about any such limitations or conditions —
MR. WILSON:

What paragraph (D) says is that X

must be extended uniformly.

It does not define X, it just

says voluntary allowance.
QUESTION: Right.
MR. WILSON:

This was the job -■*> strictly a State

law questi.on, and this was the job of the Court of Appeals.
And the way we read it is that it has those three factors.
Nov?, if we’re reading it too narrowly,, possibly wa
could certify the question to the Court? but I think that it's
implicit in what the Court has ruled there.
The purpose, of Maryland’s statutory enactment was
not to have one uniform tankwagon price in the State.
QUESTION: That may not have been its purpose, but
that’s v?hat it seems to require on its face.
MR. WILSON:

I see.

QUESTION: What you're saying, then, say 'where they
talk about Baltimore and Salisbury, say a big company has one

55

station in Salisbury, it can grant voluntary allowances there
without worrying about this statute?
MR. WILSON:
QUESTION;

No, it cannot —
Or what would otherwise be a voluntary

allowance -MR. WILSON:

What would otherwise be a voluntary

allowance, that is correct, Mr. Justice Stevens.
QUESTION; That would not violate the statute.
MR. WILSON; That would not violate the statute.
QUESTION:

So if they -treat all their stations

within a given market alike —MR. WILSON; Right.
QUESTION;

— there’s no problem under the Maryland

statute.
MR. WILSON:
QUESTION:

And there are many other —
That's interesting, because -there could

be a problem under the federal statute.
MR. WILSON; Well, —
QUESTION; I3ut, anyway, that’s interesting.
MR. WILSON;

— tlie statutes don’t do exactly the

same things, Mr. Justice Stevens. We do catch purely intrastate sales under this statute.
QUESTION:

Well, if you're only concerned with

intra-brand competi-cion.
MR. WILSON:

That is correct.

That is correct.

56
And tiie definition that the Court of Appeals used
allowed what we consider to be the proper interplay between the
policies of intra-brand price rigidity and inter-brand price
flexibility in competition, by saying that the 2(b) defense is
available in the situation where you have a shared customer.
The second ground that four of the appellants have
attacked the const!tuti.on&lity of paragraph (D) on is commerce,
Now, Mr, Simon did not address the commerce question with
regard to paragraph (D),

I would presume that he has com© to

the same conclusion that I have, and that is that the question
is not properly before the Court,

The reason we say that is

that paragraph (D) was struck down in summary judgment,, and
only on the grounds of conflict, not on th© grounds of commerce.
Summary judgment was not moved on the grounds of
commerce, only on conflict.
Appeals solely on conflict.

It was reversed at the Court of
When the Court of Appeals issued

its mandate to the lower court, at -that time the appellants
uu® opportunity to move for trial on the commerce question
w.iih regard to paragraph (D) ,

But they did not do so, so we

presume that that appeal is waived,
However, we have responded to the question in our
brie.L and have only responded to it today because we don*t
believe there is any undue burden whatsoever in interstate
commerce„
QUESTION:

Was the commerce question presented to the

57
Maryland Court of Appeals?
MR. WILSON;
paragraph

No, it was aot.

Not with regard to

(D) .
QUESTION: Was it ever presented in any way?
MR» WILSON: Th© only place, Mr. Justice White, that

■fee Connerce question was ever presented —
QUESTION:

Does it appear in the record?

Does the

question ever ©merge in the record?
MR. WILSON:

Only from the bill of complaints0

The entire statute -•*
QUESTION: Well, that’s pretty important, isn’t it?
MR. WILSON: The entire statute was claimed to
violate the commerce clause, but when summary judgment was
moved under paragraph (D), it was moved only on the grounds of
conflict®

But, at any rate, we do not at all assert that we

have a commerce problem.

We will respond to the question.

W© believe, however, that, if this Court is going to
strike down paragraph (D)

on the grounds of conflict with the

Rob ins on-Patman Act, the Coiirt must do two things:

First,

it must answer the question that it specifically reserved in
its 1963 Sun Oil decision, and answer it in a way which upholds
th© 1967 Federal Trade Commission Policy Report, with respect
to the oil industry.
And, second, *— and now w@ get back to Mr, Simon’s
point — even if it does adopt that position, it must, also

58
hold that section 2(b)

is a constitutional right, that it's an

absolute right of constitutional proportions and not merely a
defense to a section 2(a), 2(d)

or 2(e)

violation»

We submit that th© answer to the question which ‘this
Court reserved in Sun must be that unless an oil company is
offering a lower price to its dealer, in response to a lower
price which has been offered to that dealer by another oil
company, they are not entitled to the section 2(b)

defense»

We say this also with regard to section 2(a) , primary
line liability, that is, liability between sellers»

We know

of no case except a situation that involved secret brokerages
and vertical price fixing, we know of no case in which primary
line liability has been assessed absent assured customers»
We strenuously submit that th® FTC policy statement
is wrong» The only thing that’s offered to justify that
statement is -that there can be no denying that oil companies
compete with each other»

We don't deny that oil companies

compete with ©sch other, but we certainly do deny that oil
companies are competitors with respect to their immediate
customers»

And again we think this is what section 2(b)

requires»
Now, oddly enough, it appears — and when it comes
to other sections of the Rob ins on-™ Patman Act, section 2(d) ,
and when it doesn't com© to tee oil industry, the Federal
Trade Commission agreed with us»

In 1969 it issued a policy

59

statement with regard to meeting competita,on under sections
2(d) and 2(e), it amended that policy statement — or, excuse
me, with guidelines in 1972,

Those guidelines are still in

effecti
?
They are commonly known as the Fred Myer guidelines
and they are the advertising allowances arid other merchandise
opinions and services.

It's secti,on 240,16.

And it says:

A seller charged with discrimination and violation of section
2(d) or section 2(e) may defend his actions by showing that
the payments were mads or the services were furnished in good
fait.il to meet equally hrgh payments mad© by the competing
seller to that particular

excusa ms, to the particular

customer.
And w© say that is the shared customer that we're
talking about.
It goes on,

It says;

For instance, it is insufficient

to defend th® charge of violating either section 2{d) or 2(a)
solely on the basis that competition in a particular industry
l.s very Keen, requiring a special allowance be given to some
customers if the seller is to be competitive.
It seems to me that's exactly the position that the
Federal Trade Commission has taken with, respect to the oil
industry.
QUESTION; But the appellants here are taking a
position somewhat more precis© than that, not just generally

60
that the competition of the industry is very keen, but that
they had a Robins on-Patman. Act defense if 'they give a voluntary
allowance in order to meet their competitor seller's price in
that market to another service station.
MRs, WILSON:

Well, that isn't correct, Mr. Justice

Stewart.
QUESTION; That's more precise than —
MR. WILSON;

It is more precise. When I say meeting

corapetition, that's too broad.

One of the reasons we find

fault with the FTC policy position is we think that what it
does is that it takes an antitrust defense, section 2(b),
and broadens it impermissibly, to a point where it becomes
indistinguishable from the old meeting competition defense
which section 2(b) was enacted to narrow.
But with regard to your specific question, we think
that it is unmistakable that section 2(b) is a seller’s
right., And the way you determine whether you’re looking at a
seller's right is whether there's any benefit to the customer
who receives this lower price.
Because, as this Court pointed out in its 1951
Standard Oil decision, Robinson-P&tman policy — and that is
•She policy which promotes intra-brand price rigidity and non­
injury to intra-brand competition — is no

way furthered if

a seller is denied the ability to meet a lower price which
has actually bean offered to his customer, because that

61

customer is going to be getting — going to get that price
regardless,, either from his present supplier or the one who
offered the price.
In either event, competition, intra-brand competition
is going to be injured.
But this is not true with regard to tie oil industry.
Captive customers, such as gasoline dealers, don't have
competitors out looking for their business,

An Exxon dealer

does not enjoy the practical alternative of purchasing his
gasoline from Shell if Exxon denies him a voluntary allowance,
it just doesn't work that way.
And we think it's policy of promoting intra-brand
price ; rigidity, because we're talking about sellers starting
at 'the same point, promoting their policy, and dropping that
policy only when there's no point keeping it any longer because
you're going to have that injury regardless.
makes sense to say, "Fin®,

At that time, it

Robinson-Patman isn't going to be

helped by holding on, give the seller this right of seif
defense, let him meet that price."
Nov;, with regard to the other question that we believe
this Court would have to find in order to find that paragraph
(D) would fall under conflict, is that section 2(b) is a right
of constitutional proportions.
QUESTIONs

When you say constitutional proportions,

do you include the supremacy clause?

62

MR. WILSON;

Yes, I do, Mr. Jiasti.ee Rehnquist.

QUESTION: Well, then, why ~ this isn't anything new,
then, what, you're already said, is it?
MR. WILSON: Excuse me?
QUESTION:

I don't know how it adds anything to what

you've already argued.
MR. WILSON:

Well, the only position that we have

on that is that it’s just an area that 2(a) doesn't cover,
and -there's no reason why a State can't cover it.
With respect to the commerce question, as we said,
we don't believe it's properly presented, we think that if
our interpretation of section 2(b) is accepted, then there
can be no situation where any burden on commerce appears at
the State line.

And the reason w© say that is that obeying

the Robinson-Patman Act, as we understand it, would also be
obeying paragraph (D), the situation would never com© up.
If we're wrong, if this Court were to answer “the
Sun question in favor of the FTC, if it were to say ‘that yes,
2(b) is an absolute right, then the situation we'd have is we
couldn't determine what the burden would be, because this was
summary judgment, nothing on the record whatsoever, and we'd
have to go back to have a factual development.
QUESTION:

Your claim is that meeting competition

under section 2(b) is & defense to a federal statute but it's
no federal right

63
MR. WILSON: That is correct»
QUESTION: And Maryland can simply way, "We’re going
to, in our legislation affecting the gasoline retail business,
we’re going to reflect the basic policy of Robins on-P&tin an,
but not give you that defense»"
MR, WILSON; That is absolutely correct, and I think
it serves two other purposes:

one, is that it gives us a

criminal provision where, under section 2(a)

the criminal

penalties under section 3 of -the Robins on-Patman Act, but not
2(a) —
QUESTION:

Not 2 (a) »

MR» WILSON: And the other is that with respect to
other factors in th© market, we also cover wholesalers»

Anyone

who is a wholesaler in Maryland under paragraph (D) who sells
gasoline to stations must obey paragraph (D),
QUESTION:

But not if he operates his own station,

he can sell at any price he wants»
MR» WILSON: Well, if he operates his own station,
Mr» Justice Stewart, it wouldn't even be a wholesale pries,
hs would be selling at retail»
QUESTION:

Well, no, because he might be a whole­

saler in part of his Business, but if he operates his own
station he can charge the public any price he wants and where
he wants —
MR. WILSON: iibsolufesly

64

QUESTION:

and have all kinds of differentiations

in the various markets in the State of Maryland.
MR0 WILSON: Absolutely correct» But we're talking
about discriminations in wholesale price, strictly wholesale
price.
I would add one point that the paragraph (D) was
enacted at the same time that paragraphs (B) and (C) were.
(B) and (C) were subsequently re-enacted.

So we viev/, as far

as the severability question goes, the three — (B) and (C)
standing together, and (D) standing by itself.

And then of

course the regular severability provision in Maryland law
would be covered by (B) and (C) itself.
In short, we submit that the entire statute must be
upheld in toto, and w© think federalism demands no less.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

You have five minutes, I think, left, Mr. Simon.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM SIMON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. SIMON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
I'd Ilk© to say first, Mr. Justice Stewart, that
w© say that 2(b) is a statutory right, —
QUESTION:

I understand, that's your difference.

MR. SIMON;

that they cannot deprive us of.

Secondly, I would like to say that the statute

65

provides on its face -that: every refiner shall extend all
voluntary allowances uniformly to all service station dealers
supplied. That is the language of the statute, with no
definition. The Court of Appeals gave one definition of the
statute, which we say is at odds with the clear language of
the statute, and Mr. Wilson just gave you a definition that is
at odds with both the statute and the Court of Appeals.
QUESTION; Well, there's no question that the Court
of Appeals definition prevails then?
MR. SIMON;

I'm sorry?

QUESTION;

There's no question but what the Court

of Appeals definition prevails in the case of those three
contradictions ?
MR. SIMON;

Right,

Yes, but we now have another

definition which was just given that is contrary to the Court
of Appeals definition.
We argued the case on the premise of the Court of
Appeals definition,
QUESTION;

Well, I think, by precedent, you are

justified in doing so.
MR. SIMON;

Yes, but I was merely pointing out that

Mr, Wilson's definition just given, to you is contrary to not
only th© statute but the Court of Appeals definition.
Attorney General Burch made much of price fixing
by dealers, and I got th© impression he was agin it; I know

66
everybody is agin it.

But. what this statuta does is makes it

unnecessary to conspire to fix prices,, because-if every
supplier# if everybody has to have the same pries to all its
dealers, or the same voluntary allowance, competition will
get them to float to the same level, and if they’ve got to
be Statewide 'che san®, then you're going to have a legislatively
mandated conspiracy.
We were told that Exxon uses alert stations to
discipline dealers who don’t do the right thing* The fact
is there ar© four alert stations in Maryland and 532 Exxon
stations in Maryland»
We were told that the independent refiners get their
crude oil from the major oil companies and therefore are
subject to their control,
record on that*

Mot a scintilla of evidence in the

And the fact is that since the enactment of

the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973# the federal
government has

been allocating crude oil, and since August

15# 1971, tiie federal government has been fixing the price of
crude oil*
We were told that there was a minimal effect on
interstate commerce by this Act, and I submit to you that an
Act which forces from -the Stata of Maryland all refiners who
engage in the sal® of gasoline at retail, an Act which bars
the entry into Maryland of all refiners who seek to sell
gasoline at retail, an Act which totally alters the distribution

patterns of refiner suppliers, and an Act which increases the
cost of operation, just like in Raymond Transpcrt, increases
the cost of operation of suppliers, has a substantial effect
on commerce, particularly when it is in an industry of the
size and magnitude of this industry.
And, finally, Mr, Justice —
QUESTION; Well, do you think it discriminates against;
interstate commerce as well as burdens it?
MR. SIMON;

I think it burdens it, and what I think

discriminatas against interstate commerce, Mr. Justice White,
is putting the dealer, the branded dealer, with the high price
in this preferred position.
QUESTION; Well, it doesn’t discriminate against the
interstate wholesaler.
MR. SIMON;

No, sir, it discriminates against the.

interstate suppli@r-retai.ler, and in favor of the branded
dealer who is thereby insulated from the cut price of the
refiner-supplier.
And, finally, I would like to say that Professor
Patterson, whom Attorney General Burch referred to in his
testimony, expressly testified that this Act was anti­
competitive in preventing the refiner-suppliers from selling
at retail, and he did not

testa.fy as Attorney General Burch,

said that the major companies use these practices that he
described to discipline dealers? and that is not in the record.

68
Thank you,
QUESTIONS Well# could I ask# was there any findings

on 'tlie independent refiner who owns his own stations?
