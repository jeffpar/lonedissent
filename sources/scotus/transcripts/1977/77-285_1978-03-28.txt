ORAL ARGUMENT OF RODERICK E. WALSTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
)
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

MR. WALSTON:

the Courts
The issue before the Court today is whether section
8 of the Reclamation Act of 19"'2 requires the Secretary of the
Interior to comply with state regulatory water laws when it
acquires and uses water under that particular Act
Section 8 ©abodies a fundamental historical principle
of the federal reclamation laws, the principle that within
sane yet undefined limits the states have seme measure of
control over the use and distribution of such water; thus the
principle in this case is one of ultimata historic signifi­
cance, wa believe.

It is whether that principi©, that sub-

i

stantive principle of. the federal reclamation laws will remain
a viable principle of those laws.
During my argument this afternoon, I intend to focus
:

i

on what wa consider to be fcha three major issues before the
Court,

First, did Congress in fact in 1902 establish a prin­

ciple of state controlled waters, did Congress actually give

3
that power to the states?

Second, if it did, how can we recon­

cile that principle with the many substantive congressional
policies that Congress has enacted in the field of reclamation,
both in the 1902 Act and in later Acts?

In other words, how

do wa reconcile potential conflicts between state and federal
policies?

And, third, how do we reconcile the principle of

state control with the broad discretion which Congress has
given to the Secretary of the Interior to carry cut the sub­
stantive congressional policies?
How, let me turn to the facts of the case.

The

Reclamation Act of 1902 essentially provides for federal con­
struction and operation of reclamation facilities in about 17
western states.

Under 'the authority of that Act, Congress has

authorised a number of reclamation facilities in California
that are collectively knovm as the Central Valley Project.
The Bureau of Reclamation has always complied with
California regulatory water laws in acquiring its water rights
for the Central Valley Project.

It has always submitted permit

applications to the California Water Resources Control Board,
the board has always granted permits to the bureau, the board
has usually imposed conditions in those permits, the bureau has
always complied with the conditions in th© permits.
In fact, since 1927, the state board has issued 12
major decisions that result in the issuance of conditional
permits to the Bureau of Reclamation.

4
Then in 1973, the United States film its present
action for declaratory judgment, and in this action it asks
the court to determine that the Bureau of Reclamation need not
comply with California’s appropriation procedure and thus that
it need not comply with conditions in the permits which have
been issued to the bureau.
The effect of this position, of course, would bo to
avoid the conditions in all 12 decisions which have been issued
by the state board.

By way of illustration, the United States

in its complaint referred to a specific decision called
Decision 1422.

This decision results in the issuance of con­

ditional permits to the Bureau of Reclamation for the Hew
Melones Project on the Stanislaus River in California.

The

New Melones Project is a dam and reservoir facility that was
authorised by Congress in 1944, and it was reauthorized in
1962,
i

In its complaint, the United States argues that the
state board lacks power under any and all circumstances to
impose any kind of condition upon the federal water right. And
Calfironia, by way of contrast, argues that California has a
qualified power to isj^pose conditions.

It argues that it can

Impose conditions if those conditions do not impair or interfere with the basic congressionally authorised purposes of
federal reclamation projects.
The lower court upheld fch© position of the United

5
States.

It held that the state board is without power to im­

pose conditions under any and all circumstances, that there is
no circumstance where such a condition can be imposed upon an
appropriated permit issued to the bureau, and on that basis
the court granted summary judgment for the United States.
The court did not reach the question whether the
conditions of Decision 1422 or, for that matter, any other
decision issued by the state board in fact conflict with any
congressionally authorised purposes of the project.

It avoided

that question because it held that the question was simply not
relevant.

QUESTION;

Was the phrase “congressionally author­

ised purpose of the project" one of — gotten out of the legal
literature or used originally by the State of California or by
the United States?
MR. WALSTONs

It reflects the position of the United

States, Justice Rehnquist.

We have maintained throughout this

litigation that the state has the power to impose conditions
under section 8 of the Reclamation Act, which I will momentar­
ily describe.

We also will point out momentarily that Congress

has subsequent to 1902 adopted a number of reclamation policies
and established a number of individual reclamation projects,
and in our view every time Congress establishes such a policy
or authorises such a project, it subtracts from the authority
which it originally gave the statas in 1902.

6
QUESTION:

Well, what if Congress said wa want to

have the New Melones Project and we are going to appropriate
all vested water rights in the State of California that are
inconsistent with the operation of that, would you think
Congress could do that if it simply set forth that in the
authorization act?
MR. WALSTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, very definitely.

Consistently with the Gerlach Live Stock

case?
MR. WALSTON:

Yes.

As I understand Gerlach, the

Court was merely holding that in that particular case section 8
required reference to state law.

But you are suggesting in

the hypothetical, Justice Rehnquist, that Congress might over­
ride section 8 in some particular fashion.
■V'
QUESTION!
What power do you suppose they would he
s'\

exercising if they did that?
MR. WALSTON:

I think that it would have that power

under either the Commereo Claus© or the Property Claus© of the
United States Constitution.

There are decisions of this Court,

by the way, going back to 1907 that give a contrary view.

For

instance, in Kansas v. Colorado, this Court seemed to suggest
that Congress didn’t have that constitutional power.
QUESTION:

And what subsequent cases have suggested

that it doss have that power?
MR. WALSTON:

We think that a fair analysis of this

7
Court's decisions in Ivanhoe and Fresno would support the con­
cept that Congress has this constitutional power, because in
tho3@ cases the Court essentially held that Congress could
override state water laws in specific areas.
QUESTION:

Not vested water rights.

Did you really

mean to answer the Justice that if there had been adjudicated
water rights in the State of California that without condemning
them and buying them, Congress should appropriate them by an
act?
MR. WALSTON:

Congress can certainly condemn them

under the •—

;

QUESTION:

I know, but that isn't what he asked you,

QUESTION:

Can we simply say they are now ours,

without condemning then?
MR. WALSTON:
QUESTION:

No, I don’t think so.

Well, you answered that they could.

MR. WALSTON:

Well, I was assuming ,a broader ques­

tion perhaps than Justice Rehnquist.

I thought you were talk­

ing about unappropriated water —
QUESTION:

So you agree that if there had been ap­

propriate rights that had been adjudicated, that the United
States must buy them?
MR. WALSTON:
QUESTION:

Absolutely.

Very definitely.

Now, let's talk about the unappropriated

3
MR. WALSTON:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

Now# that is the subject you are now

addressing.
MR. WALSTON:
QUESTION:

Correct.

Now, what power do you say?

MR. WALSTON:

With respect to unappropriated water,

we think the United States would have the power under the
Commerce Clause and the Property Clause of the U.S. Constitu­
tion to acquire such water.
QUESTION:

Do you find any case in this Court that

names those two particular powers?
MR. WALSTON:

I would say that this Court's decision

in the Beaver Portland case, for example, holds that the
states essentially have the right to control the unappropriated
water of the western states, but is subject to two major
congressional constitutional limitations.

One limitation is

found in the Commerce Clause and th© other is found in the
Property Clause.
QUESTION:

What power do you suppose,- the United

States is exercising when it decides to build a reclamation
project at all?
MR. WALSTON:

X think it can exercise that power

under either the Commerce Clause or the Property Clause.
QUESTION:

You don’t think the Welfare Clause is —

MR. WALSTON:

Oh, possibly also.

I know —

9
QUESTION:

That is the way this Court has talked

about reclamation project, isn't it?
MR. WALSTON:

I think in the Ivanh.oe case the Court

did make reference to the Welfare Clause.

But I think the

traditional approach that this Court has taken in most cases
has been to rely on the Commerce Clause and the Property
Clause.
QUESTION:

Well/ what cases ever relied on the Com­

merce Clause to support the taking by the United States of un­
appropriated water in a situation that didn't involve a navi­
gational servitude as wall?
MR. WALSTON:

That did not involve navigation servi­

tudo?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. WALSTON:
QUESTION:

I can’t thihk of any.

I can't either.

MR. WALSTON:

The Court has usually held that the

Commerce Clause and navigational servitude are essentially the
same, and in the 1899 decision in Rio Grande it seems to
suggest that there might be a Commerce Clause power to take
water as part of navigational servitude.

But I don't think

this Court has ever held that where navigation is not concerned
Congress has powers under the Commerce Clause to take unappro­
priated water.

I hate, of course, to foe defending the posi­

tion of the United States in this litigation at this point, but

10
essentially what we are really talking about in this case is
whether Congress in fact required the Bureau of Reclamation
to comply with state law in acquiring unappropriated water.
So the issue in the case is precisely that, did
Congress in section 8 provide that the states must comply with
the — that the Bureau of Reclamation must comply with state
water laws.

If the state board lacks a qualified power to

impose any kind of conditions on the federal water right, then
the conditions of all 12 decisions which the state board has
issued, including Decision 1422, would be valid.

And if, on

the other hand, the state board has that power, then the con­
ditions of all 12 decisions we think are beyond collateral
attack for the reason that the United States has never chosen
to seek direst judicial review of any of those decisions.
In any event, assuredly the Court cannot examine the
conditione of any particular decision in this case because
that matter was not before the lower court and the lower court
didn9t take any evidence on the question.
Now, this brings is to what 1 consider to be the
first major question before the Court and that is whether
Congress in fact in 1902 established the principle that the
states have the right to control water from federal reclamafcion projects under tha 1902 Act.

Section 8 specifically pro-

vides that the Secretary shall “proceed in conformity with
state laws relating to the control, appropriation, us© or

11
distributior* of water.
QUESTION:

Well, let me ask you one question which

is ■— I see you are starting a new part of your argument —
a follow-up of the earlier colloquy we had.

Supposing the

State of California had a homesteading programs whereby state
owned land was made available to citizens of California who
were willing to reside there for two years, and the United
States came in and said v» find that it is just necessary to
take a lot of this homestead land for the New Melones Project.
Do you think it would have a right to do that without paying
California for it?
MR.

WALSTONs

No, I don’t believe that it

would.

I

don’t believe that there is any decision of this Court which
would support the United States in that endeavor.

Of course,

the -—
QUESTIONS

Well, why do you think Congress has a

right to take unappropriated water from the state?

There has

never been — maybe because there has never been an

adjudica­

tion in this Court as to who owns the water in non-navigable
streams.
MR. WALSTON:

Well, that’s true, and this Court has

always avoided that question.

In fact, in the 1945 decision

in —

QUESTION:

There has teen one as to who owns the

water in the navigable streams, hasn’t there?

MR. WALSTON:

I don't recall that offhand.

MR. WALSTON:

The Court

QUESTION:

Not in terms of ownership.

MR. WALSTON:

QUESTION:

Pardon me?

Not in terms of ownership.

MR. WALSTON:

Correct.

The Court has never held

that the United States owns the unappropriated water of the
western states.

It has held, however, that tha Unit©! States

might have sane overriding constitutional powers that enable it
to act and establish a certain degree of control over those
waters, but has not actually established that the Unit©!
States has the power to actually own the water itself.
Let me turn now to the language of section 8 itself.
The section on its face requires the Secretary to proceed in

I
conformity with state laws relating to the control, appropria­
tion, use or distribution of water.

On its face, this section

clearly requires federal compliance with state appropriation
laws.

The state appropriation laws in turn provide for state

regulatory control of water.
trol the water.
priation laws.

This is the way the states con­

They control the water through their appro­
They determine the beneficial use of their

water, they thus manage an! control their limited water supply,
an! thus the section on its face requires the federal government

13
to be treated as a private appropriafcor under the state's ap­
propriation laws.

Essentially the United States makes two arguments
with respect to the moaning of section 8.

First, it argues

that the section does not require the Secretary of the Interior
to comply with state laws relating to unappropriated water, but
that the Secretary merely dees so as a matter of comity.

He

doesn't have to do it, he simply does it because he chooses to
do it.
\

Secondly, the United States argues that section 8
actually requires him to comply with state laws, it requires
him only to comply with the so-called forms of state law, and
the forms of state law are defined by the United States as
consisting of all state laws other than those that provide for
regulatory control of water.
Now, this conclusion we think is wholly consistent
with the language of section 8 itself.

The language says that

the Secretary shall proceed, not may proceed or could proceed
or should proceed but shall proceed in conformity with state
law, and thus suggests that he does not do so as a matter of
comity.
Secondly, the section specifically refers to state
laws relating to the control of the use and the distribution
of water.

Those are the words in the section itself, control,

use and distribution.

These are terms obviously that include

14
state regulatory control.
The result which we suggest is even more clear we
think under the legislative history of the Reclamation Act of
1902.

And with the Court’s indulgence, I would like to just

briefly make reference to a couple of selected portions of the
legislative history that we think shows the overwhelming
sentiment of the 1902 Congress for the principle state control.
If the Court would, I would like to refer to my brief in the
case, which is the blue brief, the brief for the petitioners.
Let's turn first, if you would, to page 25, and just listen
to the language Congressman Mondell of Wyoming, who was the
floor leader for section 8 and in fact the entire Reclamation
bill when it was before the House of Representatives.
QUESTIONS

Page 25 of your brief, right?

MR. WALSTON:

Yes, that is correct, the blue brief.

About half-t^ay down,

in the italicized portion of

the brief, Congressman Modell states, "the Secretary of the
Interior would proceed to make the appropriation of the neces­
sary water by giving the notice and complying with the forms
of law of the State or Territory in which the works are
located."
Now, the United States essentially concedes that
that language is not consistent with its canity argument, but
it makes the argument that this language is consistent with
its so-called form argument.

15
But without arguing that point/ without arguing
whether Congressman Mondell actually meant to suggest a dis­
tinction between the forms and the substance of state law, it
is very clear from other portions of the legislative history
that no such distinction was intended.
For instance, refer to page, say, 27 of our opening
brief.

Again, Congressman Mondell speaking — and this is

the quote that appears near the top of the page — "Section 8
follows the well-established precedent in national legislation
of recognising local and State laws relative to the appropria­
tion and distribution of water, and instructs the Secretary
of the Interior in carrying out the provisions of the act to
conform to these laws."
Page on page 24, the floor leader for the bill in
the Senate, Senator Clark, of Wyoming, stated — and this
quotation appears about half-way down the page — "It is right
that the General Government should control, should conserve,
and should reservoir the head waters of these streams.
this it is a national and not a State proposition.

In

But in the

distribution of these waters...it is right and proper that the
various States and Territories should control in the distribu­
tion.

The conditions in each and every State and Territory

are different.

What would be applicable in one locality is

totally and absolutely inapplicable in another.”
The United States makes no response —

Is he talking about Minnesota, where we

have a surplus of water as compared with a state where they
have a shortage of water, or just what?

There is very little water in all the

about was unappropriated water, because that is the water that
the federal government normally acquires.
QUESTION;

But the differences that he seemed to be

emphasizing, what differences do you suggest he was talking
about?
MR. WALSTON:

The differences between what, Mr. Chief

Justice?
QUESTION:

Well, what would be applicable in one

locality, totally and absolutely inapplicable in another?
MR. WALSTON:

Well,

some states and some portions

of states have highly developed metropolitan areas.

Other

states and other portions of other states have undeveloped
rural areas and —•
QUESTION:

This might be comparing Montana or

Wyoming with California?
MR. WALSTON:

Right.

Exactly.

In California, for

17
example, we need water for purposes that may not exactly apply
in Montana or Wyoming.

Wyoming needs water for argicultura

and irrigation primarily.

California, especially the developed

metropolitan areas of California need water for municipal use.
Because of

certain environmental balances and in fact in some

cases imbalances in these states, water in some instances must
be made available for environmental protection, because —

QUESTION:

Was this all apparent to Congressman

Mondell in 1902?
MR. WALSTON:

No, not at all.

I think in 1902

Congress was just getting this program off the ground and they
felt that the best way to proceed would be to proceed by having
the Secretary of the Interior comply with state lax* because
the states had always controlled their unappropriated waters.
In fact, this Court had recognised the tradition a number of
times that the states traditionally control their unappropri­
ated waters, and the same tradition was recognized by Congress
back in the Mining Acts of 1866 and 1870, and the Desert Land
Act of 1877.
The states essentially have traditionally controlled
their unappropriated waters, and Congress in 1902 quite
evidently xvanted to continue and extend that tradition.
An examination of the administrative practice that
occurred after the 1902 Act was passed shows I think quite
convincingly that Congress was actually successful in its

18
effort to provide for state control of water.

But the

Secretary of the Interior has in fact consistently and fully
complied with 3tate regulatory water laws in acquiring and
using his water under the Act.

For instance, in California,

the Bureau of Reclamation has always acquired appropriated
permits from California.

California has traditionally imposed

conditions in those permits, and the bureau lias always complied
with those conditions.

Until this case, they never sought to

destroy those conditions.

But in this case, the United States

is advancing the argument that the Secretary only complied
with those state laws as a matter of comity * and we think that
is entirely inconsistent with everything that the Secretary of
the Interior has said ever since 1902 onward with respect to
his obligation under section 8.
In fact, even the current operating regulations of
the Secretary of the Interior embrace the principle of state
control.

Let me just read from these.

39 of our opening brief.

These appear at page

These are the current regulations

of the bureau:
"The Reclamation Act recognizes the interests and
rights of the States in the utilization and control of their
water resources and requires the Bureau, in carrying out pro­
visions of the Act, to proceed in conformity with State water
laws.

Since the construction of a reservoir and the subsequent

storage and release of water for beneficial purposes normally

19
entails stream regulation, it is necessary to reach an under­
standing with the States regarding reservoir operating limi­
tations."

Thus, the Secretary has always complied with state
law, has always said that he is required to do so under section
8. And in this case the United States is essentially trying to
change the rules of the game 76 years, as it were, after the
game was started, essentially trying to break and destroy the
historic relationship that has guided through the ages —
QUESTION;

Of course, there is no problem unless

there is a conflict?
MR. WALSTON:
QUESTION:

Pardon me?

There is no problem unless there is a

conflict?
MR. WALSTON:

That is our position, Justice Marshall.

Let me turn to that just briefly.
QUESTION:

I mean the possibility was that all along

it worked because there was no conflict in these seventy-some
years.
MR. WALSTON:

Well, I think that is true.

In other

words, the states were traditionally imposing conditions that
did not conflict with specific congressional policy and thus
under those circumstances the Secretary complied with those
conditions.
QUESTION:

Well, in other forms, when state

rules

20

conflict with Congress' rules, what happens?
MR. WALSTON:
QUESTION:
Congress,

Pardon me?

Usually when the state conflicts with

Congress prevails.
MR. WALSTON:

Oh, absolutely, and we concede that

the same result applies here, Mr. Justice Marshall.

Let me

address that question more in detail.
QUESTION:

I would appreciate it.

MR. WALSTON:

Obviously, since 1902 Congress has

established a number of subsidy reclamation policies.

It has

established and enacted, in fact, four different acts that
essentially amend the Reclamation Act of 1902.

On top of that,

it authorized individual reclamation projects that have basic
congressional policies behind them.

And some experts in the

field of water law, and especially some advocates of the
states rights position have argued that section 8 literally
imposes no limits on state control and therefore none should
be implied, thus under that view the states would have the
right to override substantive congressional policies and have
the right to exercise the veto power over the project.
The difficulty with that view, of course, is what
you are suggesting, Justice Marshall, and that is that the
states could under those circumstances completely obliterate
congressional objectives that led to the act and to the federal
reclamation program in the first place.

21
QUESTION:

Well, in addition, I think it would be

hard put to find a western state law school that didn't teach
water law, and you won't find many eastern ones who do.

Isn't

that just a fact?
MR. WALSTON:
pose that is true.

I

Well, that is certainly true.

I sup­

think that there are some staunch advo­

cates of the position I have just pointed out, certainly in
the western water school.

But at the same time, that is not

the view we are urging, Mustice Marshall, I want to make that
very clear.
QUESTION:

Well, you recognise the fact that

California needs water?
MR. WALSTON:
QUESTION:

Right.

And what eastern state needs water?

MR. WALSTON:

The eastern states just don't have a

problem like the western states do.
QUESTION:

i

Right.

MR. WALSTON:

So that is why the entire Reclamation

Act only applies to the western states.

The United States, by

the way, made the argument that in order to preserve these
congressional objectives I just talked about, the Secretary of
the Interior should have absolute control, absolute control
over water uses under the Reclamation Act of 1902.
Now, that might be a very good policy argument, but
it is simply inconsistent with what Congress did in 1902.

It

22

is inconsistent with section 8 and then the principle of state
control that is embodied in section 8.

And our view is this:

We think that these various principles can be harmonized and
reconciled.

We think that the principle of state control

should apply only to the extent that it's consistent with what
Congress actually intended to accomplish in the field of
reclamation.

In other words, where there is a clash or a

conflict between congressional policy and state policy, then
obviously congressional policy overrides.

On the other hand,

if there is no such conflict, then state law applies.

And

that is to say that the states cannot override what Congress
has done, but by the same token the Secretary of the Interior
cannot override what the states have done if the states have
acted consistently with basic congressional policy.
In other words, a federal bureaucrat in Sacramento
cannot decide to sell water to an irrigation district on the
north side of the Sacramento River rather than the south side,
and then claim that his decision represents congressional
policy and then claim that because his decision represents
congressional policy, his decision overrides state law.

Because

if he has that power, the Secretary has that power, then state
law has no room in a federal reclamation scheme, and under
those circumstances the principle of state control in section
8, whieh has

la £©©fe,

honored for 7 6 years, simply does not exist.

Court took in two cases in the 1950's and 1960's, the Ivahoe
and the Fresno cases.

In Ivanhoe, state law conflicted with

the basic congressional policy that provides for an acreage
limitation, and that is found in section 5 of the Reclamation
Act of 1902.

The Court said state law does not apply, it can­

not conflict with a specific congressional policy.
In Fresno, state law conflicted with a specific
principle of the federal reclamation laws found in the 1939
Act that provides a preference for water for irrigation pur­
poses over municipal purposes, and the Court again said state
law cannot apply under those circumstances.
QUESTION:

Well, what if your water — who did the

adjudication here, the water board?
MR. WALSTON:

The California State Water Resources

Control Board.
QUESTION:

Suppose that there had been a determina­

tion by the federal authority so that these deficiencies in
the federal scheme that the board found were resolved, that
they did have a need for the water, they established a need for
the water, et cetera, and suppose the need had been irrigation
and the Fed rules'have done as much as they possibly could to
establish this need.

Nov;, could the —- I take it you wouldn't

suggest that the board could say, well, we just don't allow
water to he used for irrigation in the state?
MR. WALSTON:

That is a correct statement of our

position, Mr. Justice White.

QUESTION:

And because of some specific provision of

the federal act, I take it?
MR. WALSTON:

No, because of an interpretation of

section 8 in light of the purposes of the Act which authorized
the individual project in question.

In other words, Congress,

in authorizing specific reclamation projects, always has basic
purposes in mind.
QUESTION:

So the state’s position is that if Congress

makes a determination that it -- if there is any unappropriated
water in California and it decides clearly and finally to use
some water for irrigation and they have a project to develop
the water, that the California board must appropriate the
water to them for use of irrigation, even though seme state
agency wanted to use it, it would have to save it for municipal
purposes?
MR. WALSTON:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

And on what basis do you answer that, give

that answer to that question?
MR. WALSTON:

Well, we think, going back to the

original question, Justice Rehnquist, we think that Congress
has the power under the Commerce, Property and General Welfare
Clauses to use the western states' unappropriated water in
whatever ways that are consistent with those particular —
QUESTION:

Well, as I understand the General WeIf are

25
Clause as interpreted in United States v. Butler, it was said
that it gave Congress the power to tax and spend for the gen­
eral welfare without being required to find further authority
under the Commerce Clause or some other affirmative grant of
power.

But do you conceive what Justice White's hypothetical

poses to you as simply being an exercise of the power to spend?
MR. WALSTON:

Well, that is the way I read this

Court's decision in the Ivanhoe case.
QUESTION:

You would say that it could also be sus­

tainable under the Commerce Clause?
MR. WALSTON:

Right.

If the Court wants to back off

of that, we are certainly not going to try to dissuade the
Court from doing so.
QUESTION:

You would be delighted, I suppose.

MR. WALSTON:
QUESTION:

Pardon me?

You would be delighted.

MR. WALSTON:

Well,

I should think so.

tainly give the states more control.

It would cer­

But at the same time I

think it is very important for the Court to bear in mind that
California is equally interested in the achievanent of basic
reclamation objectives established by Congress.
QUESTION:

Arid water saving?

MR. WALSTON:

That's correct.

And we don't really

perceive that there is any conflict between what California is
trying to accomplish in this field and what Congress is trying

26
to accomplish.
QUESTION:

But Justice White's question did pose to

you a conflict/ I would think, where the federal government
comes in and says we want to use this water for irrigation and
the law says domestic: use has priority, and the water appro­
priation board says we have 18 applicants for domestic use who
can be only partially satisfied, you say nonetheless the
government's claim must prevail for irrigation?
MR. WALSTON:

Yes, that’s correct.

We are conceding

hypothetically that there could be a conflict, and if there is
a conflict, than it must be resolved in favor of Congress.
But I am pointing out, Justice Rehnquist, that in actual fact
there have been no such conflicts of any measurable degree
between what the states have been trying to accomplish and what
Congress has teen trying to accomplish, and there is no such
conflict even in this case.
The conflict in this case is not between Congress and
the State of California.

It is between the State of California

and tha Secretary of the Interior.

The Secretary of the

Interior is essentially trying to proceed with a number of
plans in California that have no mandate under congressional
law.

He is trying to proceed with plans that were not con­

sidera:! or mandated by Congress, and thus we feel what we are

j

doing is quite consistent xtfifch what Congress had in mind in
the field of reclamation, and thus there is no clash ultimately

27
in this case between federal and state policy.
That brings rue, I think, to the third major question
which I would like to address today, and that is how we actually resolve the principles we've been talking about with the
broad grant of discretion which has been given to the Secretary
of the Interior by Congress.
The United States' argument essentially is this:

It

argues that Congress has established the very broad compre­
hensive reclamation scheme and has vested the Secretary of the
Interior with raw discretion to carry out that scheme.

This

scheme is so broad, according ot the United States, that it
leaves no roan for state control at all.

The Secretary of the

Interior has discretion to override state water laws whenever
he chooses to do so? and thus the United States is really
posing perhaps the ultimate issue in this case, and let me
phrase it this way:

Has Congress in fact enacted a compre­

hensive reclamation scheme that in fact leaves no room for
state regulatory control, or instead does the comprehensive
scheme established by Congress include state regulatory laws?
To phrase that proposition differently, does the
Secretary have a plenary discretionary authority to override
state law whenever he wants to do so?

Or instead, does section

8 limit his discretion by requiring him to comply with state
law where there is no basic conflict between state law arid
congressional policy?

28
Now, X hope the Court has no illusions with respect
to the effect of the argument being advanced by the United
States.

If that argument is upheld, then section 8 will have

no practical effect because the entire principle of state
control will be subservient to the discretion of the Secretary
of the Interior and thus will not exist.
QUESTION:

Well, what if under a particular reclama­

tion act, however, the Congress gives tc the Secretary rulemaking authority to do certain things and until he does than
there is no conflict with the state, and when he does there is
a conflict?

Then arguably at least Congress has overridden

section 8 itself?
MR. WALSTON:
QUESTION:

Well, perhaps that raises —

Section 8, after all, is just a statute

and Congress can amend it expressly or impliedly.
MR. WALSTON:

But under the circumstances you gave,

Justice White, we don't see that there would be a potential
conflict between state and congressional policy.

We think

that the Secretary would be required in exercising his discre­
tion to carry out state policy if he can possibly do so; thus,
the question is whether it is possible for the Secretary to
carry out his obligations under both state and congressional
policy.
QUESTION:

You say that section 8 is an implied

circumscription of the Secretary's authority?

29
MR. WALSTON:

Right.

Correct.

In other words, when

Congress gives discretion to the Secretary, it limits it by

requiring him to comply with state law to the extent that he
can do so consistently with his other obligations under the
congressional mandate.
QUESTION*

In some statutes they have repeated section

8 but not in all of them.
MR. WALSTON:

When you say "some statutes," you mean

statutes that authorize individual projects?
QUESTION:

Exactly.

MR. WALSTON:

I think, Justice White, that in all

statutes the Secretary is required to operate the projects
"pursuant to the federal reclamation laws," which includes
section 8.
QUESTION:

But if there happened to be a specific

provision in a future reclamation statute, a specific congres­
sional provision that would require something that wouldn't be
required -—
MR. WALSTON:
QUESTION:

Absolutely.

— then it would override section 8?

MR. WALSTON:

Precisely.

In other words, if Congress

instructs the Secretary of the Interior in its authorizing
act to provide water in Area A of the State of California, for
sure, the State of California cannot come along and say that
St fess used other areas.

30
QUESTION:

Well, what if it says in such areas as

the Secretary shall in his complete discretion determine?
MR. WALSTON:

That is a very good question, Justice

White, and I think there you get into the question of how you
interpret section 8 in light of the discretion given to the
Secretary.
Our view would be that under those circumstances, the
Secretary's discretion is still limited by section 8 in that if
he can comply with state law without violating a specific
congressional mandate, he must do so.

Because if the result

is otherwise, then section 8 just doesn't mean anything, and
the reason I say that is because the Secretary has broad dis­
cretion under the various federal reclamation laws.

Congress

has given him discretion to1 sell water; Congress has given him

I

-- ■

discretion to get money from people who purchase the water.

I

Well, if that discretion in simply selling the water is deemed
to override state laws that might otherwise condition the sale
of that water, then section 8 simply does not exist.

And

Congress has constantly reaffirmed the principle of state
control and therefore we don't believe that it meant to thus
repeal section 8 by implication.
That is what the United States is really arguing in
this case.

It is arguing that section 8 has been repealed by

but within that framework, the

The Secretary does not have discre­

tionary authority to destroy that partnership by coming in and
overriding a state law that may be fully within that congres­
sional parameter.

And the result which we are suggesting to

the Court is one we think harmonizes and reconciles the vari­
ous reclamation laws that have been established by Congress,
and thus —
QUESTION:

Could I interrupt?

It all sounds very

easy, but you often get ambiguous statutes and you often defer
to the cacretary or the head of an agency in construing his
authority.

How do you resolve, how do you decide which way

to resolve a conflict?

Does the state water board always re­

solve the dispute or do you get these borderline decisions

Who has the dispute resolution power under ycur

Well, they haven't really worked out

there has been a greater accommodation between federal and
state —

You say you have the power to impose some

conditions?
MR. WALSTON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

But not conditions which conflict with

congressional policy?
MR. WALSTON:
QUESTION:

Right.

And if the Secretary takes the view that

the condition does conflict with congressional policy, how do
you decide whether it does or does not?
MR. WALSTON:

Who decides that?

Ultimately that question would have to

be answered by the Court.
QUESTION:

And you always have litigation over it?

MR. WALSTON:

Well, I don't think there would always

In fact, as I say, the case canes to this Court

on the bare legal question of whether the states have the right
to impose any kind of conditions under any circumstances.

Once

that question is established, I don't think the federal govern­
ment and the western states are going to be running to the
Court all the time to determine whether a particular condition
or conditions are consistent with ■—

asking the Court to adopt an easy view.

We are not

If the Court wants to

adopt the easy view, then obviously it ought to uphold the po­
sition of the United States, because there is no conflict
under the United States' view.

All conflicts would be resolved

in favor of the Secretary's discretionary authority.

The

states would have no control at all.
But we think that section 8 imposes upon this Court
an obligation to examine such potential conflicts as may exist.
Section 8 can be read no other way.
QUESTION:

Just so I get it in mind , the state imposes

conditions, and you propose ten conditions, and the United
States thinks four of then conflict with the policy of the Act,
and they then have to file a declaratory judgment action, is
that the way they do it?
MR. WALSTON:

Well, no, we think they would be re­

quired to pursue California's mandamus remedies.

In other

words, the federal government would be required to seek direct
judicial review of those particular conditions.
QUESTION:

They would have to get review in the state

judicial system, they couldn't bring suit in a Federal District
Court and ask for declaratory judgment?

MR. WALSTON:

Well,

first instance ought to be brought in the state court, but, of
course —
QUESTION:

It would present a federal question,

wouldn't it?
MR. WALSTON:

Well, I was going to say that certainly

there would be no problem with the United States removing 3uch
a case to the federal courts, however.
QUESTION:

Or even starting it in the federal courts?

MR. WALSTON:
QUESTION:

Pardon me?

Or starting it in the federal courts?

MR. WALSTON:

Or starting it in the federal courts.

That raises the question of whether the United States would be
required to pursue its state judicial remedies as well as
comply with state administrative procedures.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. WALSTON:

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Walston.

Mr. Barnett.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. BARNETT, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BARNETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Barnett, do you think up to now the

states have just operated at the sufferance of the federal

35
government in these areas?

Somewhere in your discussion, if

you could treat that question.
MR. BARNETT:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I do not think there was a case, Mr. Chief Justice.

I do not agree with Mr. Walston that if the Court holds for the
United States in this case that means that the United States
sweeps the field and that the states are completely excluded
from any role in the planning of reclamation projects or in
the formulation of reclamation policy.
On the contrary*, wa submit that there is and always
has been a coordination and a consultation between the states
and the federal government, and that is illustrated by this
very case.

Indeed, there are aspects of this case which

demonstrate that what the State of California is trying to do
here is to upset and override accommodations — at least one
accommodation that had been reached with respect to the New
Melones Project.

And if you will, I will get to that in

time, but I am referring to the water quality agreement which
was an actual memorandum of agreement made between the United
States Bureau of Reclamation and the California Central Valley
Regional Water Quality Control Board with respect to water
quality functions of the New Melones Dam.
What the state board has done in Decision 1422, as I
will elaborate in more detail perhaps later, is to simply
override that agreement, unilaterally rewrite it, and thus we

36
would submit that what the state is trying to do here is to
change the rules. It is the state and not the federal govern­
ment which is trying to change the rules that have existed for
the last seventy-odd years and that have amounted to a rough
accommodation of the conflicting state and federal interests in
this area.
It is the United States submission, of course, that
all four of the judges who ruled on this case in the courts
below war© correct, that section 8 of the Reclamation Act of
1902 does not authorise a state to impose conditions on a
federal reclamation project such as the 25 conditions that were
imposed here.
On the point on which the two courts below differed,
we do not here challenge the ruling of the Court of Appeals.
That is the Court of Appeals rule that the United States is re­
quired by section 8 to file applications with the state board
for permits to appropriate the water it needs for its reclama­
tion projects.

We had contended, as Mr. Walston said, in the

District Court that we are not required by law to do that,
that we simply do it as a matt&r of comity.

We have in either

event always done it.
The Court of Appeals ruled that we are required by
law to do it and, as we state in our brief, we do not contest
that, ruling here, since —
QUESTION:

The Court of Appeals came out about a

37
hundred percent opposite from this Court in Hancock v. Train,
didn’t it?

The Court of Appeals in this case said you had to

go through the form

but you don’t have to follow the sub­

stance, and this Court in Hancock v. Train said you don’t
have to go through the form but you do have to follow the
substance.
MR. BARNETT:
Justice Rehnquist.

There is no that apparent anomaly, Mr.

But in any event, we don't think it makes

any difference here, since we did in this case apply to the
state board for our permits, since it is our policy to do so.
We do not contest the ruling that we were required to do so.
If a case were to arise where the state took such a position
that we felt that we could not do so, that would be the case on
that record in which the Court should decide whether we are
indeed required to do so.
Now, Mr. Walston has said little in his argument and
little in his brief about the 25 conditions that were imposed
1

here by the state board on the New Melones Project.

We feel

it necessary to look with some detail at those conditions,
because, as Mr. Justice Stevens suggested, it may seem fine in
the abstract to argue, as Mr. Walston has, that the federal —
that Congress can make the policy and the states can fill the
gaps, it may not be so easy in practice in reality when you
are building a dam.

And we submit that the fact® of fetei®

project illustrate that difficulty and iliustrafe, just @@

38
Mr. Justice Stevens suggested, that there would be a lot of
court cases on precisely such issues as whether four of ten
conditions were or were not consistent with what petitioners
refer to as the specific or the basic congressional policies
behind a project.
QUESTION:

Mr. Barnett, in the District Court or in

the Court of Appeals, did you take the position as you do here
that one roust study the 25 conditions to decide whether the
state can impose any conditions or not?
MR. BARNETT:

We took the position in both courts

that the state had no right to impose any conditions,

It was

petitioners, the State „of California, who moved for summary
judgment in the District Court, and the District Court granted
summary judgment in our favor.

Wa did not move for summary

judgment.
QUESTION:

But if you still maintain that they have

no power to impose any condition, why do ws have to study the
25 conditions?
MR. BARNETT:

Well, for two reasons.

One is that the

Court might not agree with us, and we might therefore --QUESTION:

But you are going to the conditions with­

out even arguing the first point.

That is why I was puzzled

about it.
MR. BARNETT:

Well, the other reason is that I think

you have to look at the conditions to show why the state should

39
have no power to impose any of them.

It is only by getting

down into the dirt, so to speak, and looking at the nitty-gritty
details that one sees of what would be involved in the legal
conclusion that petitioners are asserting, and we think it is
necessary to look at the conditions in order to see just what
the difficulties would be that would arise.
First of all, as Mr. Walston has stated, the New
Melones Dam is a project that was authorized first by Congress
in 1944 and reauthorized in 1962.'

The project as reauthorized

calls for a dam with a reservoir having a storage capacity of
2.4 million acre-feet.

This is on the Stanislaus River in

California, of course.
The project as authorized in 1962 tentatively called
for a hydroelectric power plant with a capacity of 150,000
kilowatts.

That was stated as tentative and as a result of

subsequent consultations with the Federal Power Commission,
between the Federal Power Commission and the Bureau of
Reclamation, it was decided to raise the power capacity, and it
\iras raised to 300,000 kilowatts.
QUESTION;

Mr. Barnett, is it the government8s posi­

tion that it will own the 2.5 million square-feet of water
that is stored behind the dam?
MR. BARNETT;
is not our position.

That it will own the water?

No, that

That raises the question which was

mooted with Mr. Walston and which the Court has really —

40
QUESTION:

It was never answered with respect to non-

navigable waters.
MR. BARNETT:

It has never answered the question of

who owns unappropriated water.

Now, here the water would have

been appropriated by the government, but I would say we woo Id
still not claim that we own it.

We would be in a sense, I

should think, trustees for the people to whom we would sell
the water or contract for the water pursuant to the congres­
sional legislation.
QUESTION:

But you could, for instance, decided that

that water should be used for irrigation and sell it to people
who wanted to use it for irrigation, even though under
California law

domastic use took higher priority, and if that

law prevailed they couldn't use it.
MR. BARNETT:

That would be our position, but that

is not because we own the water, it is because Congress in the
Act has authorised us to build the dam and appropriate the
water for the purpose of irrigation, among others.
QUESTION:

It is appropriated, you say.

It isn't

bought, it isn't condemned.
MR. BARNETT:
QUESTIONs

No, because it wasn't owned.

Because it wasn't owned, and yet it is

simply somehow transmogrified by the existence of this project
into something that is mad© available to people in California
under a system of law that is not consistent with California's.

41
MR. BARNETT:

Well, that is true and that system of

law arises, the law of this project arises from the acts of
Congress authorizing the project.
QUESTION:

I take it then that you would think that

Congress could constitutionally pass an act that says that wa
know the western states have been appropriating — managing
the appropriating of waters, but we are going to have a nation­
al system to appropriate the waters from all the — all of the
unappropriated water that exists in the western streams, we
are going to have a national administrative operation to do it.
MR. BARNETT:

And Congress would pay just compensa­

tion for ~
QUESTION:

No, unappropriated water.

MR. BARNETT:

Unappropriated waters.

I would think

Congress could do that constitutionally.
QUESTION:

Well, at least that is what you are saying.

You answered that question before when you answered Justice
Rehnquist, that in the Reclamation Act to some extent Congress
does that.
MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

Yes, I think that is correct.

What power is it acting under when it does

that?
MR. BARNETT:

Well, I think it is clear from cases

like Ivanhoe that the general — the power is spent through
the General Welfare and the Property ei©43@<§®

QUESTION:

It hasn't spent any money in buying these

water rights though.
MR, BARNETT:

It is not buying the water rights, but

it is buying a dam, it is spending money on the dam.
QUESTION:

Well, take the example of a California

homesteading project, supposing it builds a big dam right in
the midst of a California state forest and says we need the
land from the 3tate forest to carry out the purposes of this
dam, do you think they can just take that?
MR. BARNETT:

Then they have to pay for it.

we have got unappropriated water, which is not owned.

But here
This is

the basic question that the Court has never decided, the
ownership of unappropriated water.

The Court has avoided the

question in Nebraska v. Wyoming, and in Xvanhoe, and it is one
of those very basic, very controversial questions that we
think are bast avoided.

We contend here that when Congress

authorizes a reclamation project, the effect of that authorizetion is to assert a federal claim to the x^afcer that is needed
for that project.
Now, to the extent that that water has been appro­
priated, the federal government has to pay for it.

To the ex­

tent that that water is unappropriated, we say that Congress
has authorized a federal claim which the states must exceed to
and thereby must grant the federal government a permit for the
unappropriated water if it is available.

But in ---

43
QUESTION:

Would you turn it over to third parties

for their actual use?

MR. BARNETT:

Yes, depending on the purposes of the

particular authorizing act.

Now, in this case, the purposes

of the particular authorizing act are clearly that the water
be turned over to third parties except to the extent that it
is to be use! for recreation and the reservoir, for example.
Indeed, the purposes of the Act are what I would now like to
mention, because it is with them that the particular condi­
tions have to be compared.
Now, the petitioners here concede that the authoriz­
ing Act of this project had eight purposes — flood control,
agricultural use of the water, although it is irrigation,
municipal use and industrial use, then fish and wildlife pro­
tection, water quality control, power generation, and
recreation.
Well, pursuant to the actes authorizing the project,
the United States duly applied to the State Water Resources
Control Board for permits authorising it to appropriate the
water needed for the project.

The Unijted States filed four

such applications, two of which were applications for transfers
of applications previously filed by a state board.
In brief, and rubbing out some of the details, what
the United States asked for in these applications was the
following:

It asked for the right — it asked for a permit to

44
store 2,4 million acre-feet annually, which would be in the
reservoir behind the dam, and it asked for the right to divert
from the river 8,000 cubic-feet per second.

Both of these

requests were for all eight of the project purposes, although
I am oversimplifying somewhat.
Now, with respect to the purposes, there is a dis­
tinction that has to be borne in mind, and that is between instream and consumptive uses of the water, for example, when it
is sought to divert water for the purposes of fish culture or
downstream recreation or water quality control, for those
purposes the water is released back into the river.

It is

stored up in the spring when the water is high and then released
in the summer when the river is low for water quality control
or for fish or whatever.

Those thus are in-stream uses.

To be

distinguished are consumptive uses whereby the water does not
go back into the stream and the consumptive uses are agricul­
tural use, that is irrigation, or municipal or industrial con­
sumption of the water.

j

The other of the eight uses, that is the use for
power, is really an in-stream use.

The water is diverted only

momentarily through the penstocks of the hydroelectric plant
and then goes into the stream.
Now to fch© look at the conditions, the 25 conditions
that the state board imposed in granting these permits.

And

I, of course, do not propose to discuss all 25 of them.

We

45

have discussed most of them in our brief.

I propose here to

focus only on two or three of the most important.
In its decision^ the state board found — and this is
at page 31 of the Appendix, Volume II of the Appendix — the
state board found, "There is unappropriated water available to
satisfy the demands of the project as proposed."

But, nonethe­

less, the state board did not proceed to grant the permits for
that unappropriated water"that the United States was seeking,
rather, it imposed these 25 conditions.
Conditions one aid two are the most important.

They

i-

respond directly to the amounts of water that the United States
was seeking, and they substantially deny those amounts, despite
the board's finding that sufficient unappropriated water is
available.

,
Again to oversimplify somewhat, what condition one

does is that it grants permits for water but Only for certain
I

'

purposes, not for other purposes that were authorised in the
Act.

In brief, it grants permits for the in-stream purposes

but it denies the United States the right to store or divert
water for the consumptive purposes of irrigatioiial use or
municipal or industrial consumption.
QUESTIONS

Now, what do you understand to be their

reason for that?
MR. BARNETT;

i

Well, they give their reasons, Mr.

Justice White, in their opinion.

Their reasons are that —

46
for example, at page 23 of the opinion, they say, "The pro™
jecfc's recreational features would not adequately substitute
for'the present recreational uses of the river in the upstream
reach."

That is they want to preserve the present white water

rafting —

But what about the project — there sure

some other reasons, that Congress has failed to appropriate
money for part of the project —

47

a plan.

Tha Act provides, the 1962 ~~
QUESTION:

Well, suppose he didn't?

MR. BARNETT:

Even if he didn't, we would submit that

it is not up to the state board to trench on the authority
that Congress has given the Secretary.

If it is true, as Mr.

Walston suggested at one point, that the Secretary is acting
beyond his congressional authority, the remedy for that is not
to go to the state board.

The remedy for that would be to go

to federal court under the —
QUESTION:

That may be the remedy, but what is wrong

with the board saying you have exceeded your authority, you
shouldn't even be here asking for water as far as we can tell.
Is that beyond their cognizance?
MR. BARNETT:

Well, perhaps it wouldn't be, but the

board here has not taken the position that the Secretary was
acting beyond his congressional authority.

They say that he

doesn't have a plan for the use of the water, but there is
nothing in the Act that requires him to have a plan before he
gets the water.

It has traditionally been the Secretary's

practice to build the reservoir first and then make the con­
tracts for the water, rather than vice versa.
tha Secretary has various plans.

And indeed here

The problem is that the Act

provides that the Secretary must first determine the water
nescis of the Stanislaus River Basin before he can use the
water for consumptive uses outside the basin.

48
QUESTION:

Why is that, because Congress —

MR. BARNETT:

That is what the Act says, the 1962

Act, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

And the Secretary is right now in

the process, has right now on his desk, as it ware, recommends
fcions as to how to define the Stanislaus River Basin.

Once he

defines the basin, he will determine the needs of the basin
and then he will determine how much water can be outside the
basin —
QUESTION:

How would he even know how much to ask

for?
MR. BARNETT:

Well, Congress authorized on the basis

of the project document a reservoir of 2.4 million acre-feet
on the basis of projected needs both within the basin and out­
side of it, on the basis of projected needs.
QUESTION:

But part of that projected need is some­

thing that Congress hasn't appropriated the money for.
MR. BARNETT:

Oh, no.

Congress has appropriate! the

money for the —
QUESTION:

At least the -- what is the project that

your colleagues have referred to that was washed out?
MR. BARNETT:

That is the East Side Division that

board.

It was not thought up by the

It is not the case, as petitioners claim, that the New

Melones Dam was authorised only in connection with the East
Side Division.

The East Side Division, incidentally, is a canal,

I

49

a proposed canal to bring water southward to the east side of
the San Joaquin Valley.
QUESTION:

Is that outside the watershed?

MR. BARNETT:

That would be outside the Stanislaus

River Basin, that is true.
QUESTION:

It would.

MR. BARNETT:

But that was only one contemplated way

of bringing water outside the Stanislaus River Basin to the
service areas of the Central Valley Project.

There were aid

are many others, and the board is considering many others.
Indeed, at the beginning of Decision 1422 -- and this is at
page 19 of Volume II of the Appendix -- the board itself states,
"The Bureau has described the following areas within which the
conservation yield of the New Melones Project may be used for
irrigation or other consumptive purposes? the local service
area consisting of Tuolumne, Calaveras, San Joaquin and
Stanislaus Counties; southern San Joaquin Valley via the pro­
posed East Side Canal or a Cross Valley Canal; San Felipe
division of the CVP? San Luis unit of the CVP; the area served
by the Delta Mendofca Canal? the Montezuma Hills Unit of the
CVP? and the Suisun Marsh area. "
So it is not at all the case that simply because it
may have been decided not to build the East Side Division, and
indeed tin at decision was not made by Congress, that proposal
never got to Congress, as I understand it, because the Stata

50
of California did not endorse it, but it is not the ease that
simply because that particular proposal may have fallen through
there are no use3 for this water outside the Stanislaus River
Basin.
If I may return to these conditions which I think are
the heart of the case, as I was saying, condition one simply
prohibits the federal bureau from diverting or storing water
for the consumptive purposes that were among the purposes of
the Act, that is for irrigation or domestic, municipal or in­
dustrial consumption.
QUESTION?

Well, it is consumptive purposes which

have not been decided upon.
MR. BARNETT:

But the Secretary is in the process of

deciding on then after he defines the need —
QUESTION:

I am just trying to get a full statement.

MR. BARNETT:

Further, condition one, by limiting the

size of the reservoir, it wibl limit it because water cannot be
stored for consumptive purposes, the size of the reservoir
would be only 1.1 million acre-feet and not 2.4 million, there
is a tremendous impact on the power* that can be generated by
the project and power is also one of' the admitted purposes of
the project.
QUESTION:

I know it would never happen, but if you

did build a reservoir and dam that was too big, you couldn8t
make it smaller.

51
MR. BARNETT:

Well, that is true but it seems un­

likely in California —
QUESTION:

Or any other place.

MR. BARNETT:

— in the country that there will be

a lack of —
QUESTION:

But don't you think California has a right

to say what are you going to do with this water?
MR. BARNETT:

Well, the Act says that the Secretary

is to determine what to do — to determine the needs of the
basin and then to determine where to sell the water, and if
California is trying to tell them they have to decide where to
sell the water before you determine the needs of the basin,
than California is going against the Act.
In addition, it must be recognized at the outset
that the State of California has been in on the planning of
this project all along.
Congress in 1962.

They endorsed it initially before

This project has been no secret for the

state.
QUESTION:

Mr. Barnett, I think you said in substance

that the conditions are the heart of this case.

If your posi­

tion is that California has no authority to impose any condi­
tions, what difference does it make what these conditions
provide?
MR. BARNETT:

Well, as I said before, I think what

these conditions provide is relevant to see why it should be

52
the law that California has no authority to provide, to impose
any conditions.

In addition, it is possible that the Court

would want to look at the conditions individually and decide
if some of them are acceptable and some are not.
QUESTION:

Do you think the United States government

is required to seek a permit from California?
MR. EARNETT:

Well, as I said at the outset, we do

not contest that in thi3 case.
QUESTION:

We agree with —

Why not?

MR. BARNETT:

Well, because the Court of Appeals so

ruled, because we make it a practice to seek such a permit,
because it serves legitimate federalism functions Gf informing
the state of what we are doing.
QUESTION:

But as a matter of power, what won Id your

answer be?
MR. BARNETT:

Well, as a matter of power for pur­

poses of this case, we concede that wa are compelled to.

If

another case came up where we thought that being compelled to
was unacceptable to the federal policy involved, we would want
to reserve the right on those facts to contest the issue.

We

do not contest it here.
QUESTION:

I suppose the California board determines

whether or not there is sufficient unappropriated water?
MR. BARNETT:

Oh, yes, and the board so determined

hers, as I read, that there is sufficient unappropriated water.

53

I might mention that it isn't all the conditions here that we
would contest.

Insofar as conditions are concerned with

whether unappropriated water is available, we do not contest
those conditions.
For example, In this case there are three conditions
-- two conditions, 14 and 19, which we would not contest.
Condition 14 says that the Bureau of Reclamation is not author­
ised to collect water outside of the specified seasons, that
is —
QUESTION?
at the outset.

This goes back to the question I suggested

This is by the grace of the federal government

as a matter of generosity, to inform the states but you don't
necessarily do any more than inform them, and you accept their
conditions when you find them acceptable.
MR. BARNETT:

Well, I think that is correct, that is

the way we read the legislation.

We accept their conditions

insofar as they relate to the availability of unappropriated
water.

We do not accept their conditions insofar as they would

trench on the operation or the structure even of th© federal
proj set.
QUESTION:

What if the California Legislature ware

to next week pass a law declaring that all unappropriated
water in the state is hereby appropriate! to beneficial use
of users who will be determined by a commission appointed by
the Governor on the basis of existing California water law?

54

MR. BARNETT:

Well, that sounds as though that might

pose the question that this Court has

avoided deciding since

the Desert Land Act of 1877, and that is whether by that Act
the federal government did give ownership of all unappropriated
water to the states or not.
QUESTION:

'

There is no qviestion but that Massachusetts

owns the unappropriated waters in its streams, is there?
MR. BARNETT:

Well, Massachusetts has a riparian

rights doctrine and I don’t knovz the answer to that, Mr.
Justice.
QUESTION:

Mr. Barnett, can you put your finger in

a second or two what you think it is that gives California or
any of the other appropriation states the right to have a system
of water law under which people can have their appropriations
validated and acquire property rights?
MR. BARNETT:

Oh, I think it is a stream of federal

legislation beginning with the Mining Act of 186\S, including
i

the Desert Lands Act of 1877, and including the Reclamation
Act of 1902.

As we read the Act, the language that Mr. Walston

was relying on, and as we point out in our brief, was simply
designed to continue that tradition of making clear that pri­
vate rights to water on public land could be established by the
state doctrine of prior appropriation.
QUESTION:
<§© feis®

SS

But those acts depended for their effect
land in those states.

Now, there

55

never was any public land in the thirteen original colonies,
so surely they are not dependent on the sufferance of Congress
or those Act for any authority to determine water ownership,
are they?
MR. BARNETT:

I suppose not, and I certainly cannot

answer the question as to who owns the flowing waters in
Massachusetts, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
I was mentioning power, what conditions one and two
would do to the power output.

In the record, at page 146 of

Volume II of the Appendix, there is an affidavit by J. Robert
Hammond, who supervised the power operations of the Central
Valley Project.

As he points out, what the denial of the full

water rights requested would mean would be that the firm
capacity of the New Melons Power Plant would be reduce! to
zero, that is firm capacity is the capacity you can count on
on any day.

During the summer, when the river is very low,

you need water in your reservoir if you are going to be able to
o'

sell power.
zero. "

He says, sth© firm capacity wouId be reduced to

The average kilowatts put out per year would be re­

duced from 430 million to 192 million! the value of the power
output would thereby be reduced from $5.5 million to $1.9
million a year.

%

And he said, 91 This amount would not have

justified the power plant investment in the first place."
So this is the kind of question that arises, Mr.
Justice Stevens.

Now, petitioners would say, wall, it isn*t

56
necessarily inconsistent with -QUESTION:

I think petitioner would say, if your

facts are right, he would agree that the condition is improper,
MR. BARNETT:

No, no, they certainly do not take that

position.
QUESTION:

I thought he said if the condition would

interfere with a congressional determination of what the
statute is supposed to accomplish, the state had no power to —
MR. BARNETT:

No, but I think — we could ask them,

but I think they would take the position that sine© Congress
did not specifically say that we want $5 million worth of
power a year, that this does not conflict with a specific con­
gressional purpose.

But that is the kind of argument that the

Court would be in, how specific does Congress have to be.
QUESTION:

Turning it around for just a monent, what

I understood part of their reasoning to be is that, while you
have got a lot of other water in this overall project and so
you don't need this specific source for the time being, at
least for consumptive purposes, if they were right factually,
would they not be right legally also?
MR. BARNETT:

I don't think so, because Congress —

one of the specific provisions of the 1962 authorising Act,
written into the Act, is that the New Melones Project shall
become an integral part of the Central Valley Project and
shall ba operated as such by fch© Secretary of the Interior.

57
Now, condition four countermands that.

Condition

four provides that no consumptive use of the water from New
Melones may be made outside the Stanislaus River counties un­
less it is demonstrated that no other Central Valley source is
available to supply water to those particular areas.

Now, we

submit that that directly contradicts the language in the Act
that this project shall be integrated with the Central Valley
Project.

Petitioners would apparently say, well, it doesn't

specifically contradict it for sane reason because Congress
didn't specifically say something or other.

But we find it to

be another —
QUESTION:

But if it is an integrated project and

the total project has enough water available for those four
counties, why is this condition objectionable?
MR. BARNETT:

Well, if Congress thought the total

project had enough water available, it wouldn’t have author­
ized this project.
QUESTION:
thing, wasn’t it?

Well, I think it is sort of a temporary
Didn't they say for the time being?

I

don’t remember.
MR. BARNETT:

What the Act says, what the 1962 Act

says —
QUESTION:

I mean the conditions, some of them were

temporary.
MR. BARNETT:

Well, they are temporary in that they

58
are subject to further order of the board.

For example, con­

dition two says these limitations on the amount of water that
may be diverted and impounded are subject to further order of
the board which shall be preceded -- I am reading from page 34
of Volume II of the Appendix — such "Further order...shall be
preceded by a showing that the benefits that will accrue from
a specific proposed use will outweigh any damage that would
result to fish, wildlife and recreation in the watershed
above New Melones Dam and that the permittee has firm commit­
ments to deliver water for such other purposes."
So the federal government would have to convince the
state board that the benefits of the use of this additional
water outweigh the damages as the board sees them to the fish
and wildlife and recreation in the watershed before this addi­
tional impoundment would be allowed.

Now, we submit that this

is the board, the state board asserting for itself the power
to determine what should be done with this federal project,
should it be used for power or should it be used to preserve
the existing white water above the dam.

And we submit that

that is clearly inconsistent with the federal purposes behind
this project.
Now, they would say, well, Congress didn't say in
the Act that power is more important than white water rafting,
therefore the state can fill in the gap.

They talk a lot in

their reply brief about how it has to be a specific federal

59

policy that the state is going against,, page 58 to 59 of their
reply brief, if the state laws do not contradict the specific
purposes of the scheme, where specific elements of the con­
gressional scheme make it impossible to apply the principle,
with specific federal policy — all of their emphasis, inci­
dentally.
Now, we submit that it would be very difficult if
not impossible a thing to deside when it is the specific
federal policy and when it isn't.

Further, petitioners ap­

parently take the position that Congress to be sufficiently
specific has to say it in the statute? Congress cannot dele­
gate to the Secretary of the Interior any administrative
authority to make specific decisions, because then they say
the state decisions would override.
Now, we say that is why this whole scheme that they
propose, while it may seem fine in the abstract, when you
apply it to particular decisions of a particular project, it
simply would not work, and the federal courts, as you suggested,
Mr. Justice Stevens, would become the ultimate arbiters of
does a particular condition — is a particular condition in­
consistent or not with a federal project, and I would submit
that federal judges, even Judge McBride in Sacramento, are not
suited to be the chief engineers of federal reclamation pro­
jects.
QUESTIONi

This only applies to California, this dam?

MR. BARNETT:

This dam is only in California.

river is only in California.
QUESTION:

This

That is true.

Why does the federal government get the

right to build a dam in the middle of a state without the
state's cooperation?

MR. BARNETT:

First of all, it gets the right from

the Constitution as has been held in Ivanhoe and other cases.
It is paying for the dam.
cooperation.

In addition, it had the state's

In the appendix to our brief, we have the

official statement of th© State of California in 1962 endors­
ing this project.
QUESTION:

Well, could Congress

the simple answer

to that would be yes -- cut off the water for three other
states and leave it all in one state?

Your answer has to be

yes.
MR. BARNETT:

Well, I think no.

I think section 8

of the 1902 Act wouId prevent that, where it provides that
nothing in the Act would impair the rights of another state
on an interstate river.
QUESTION:

I take it you think that this Court has

already two or three times construed section 8 the way you
think it should be construed?
MR. BARNETT:

Oh, I do, and I would note how Mr.

Walston, while he mentioned the Ivanhoe decision, did not
mention at all City of Fresno, Arizona v.

California, which

61

we, of course, think make it very clear that this question
has been decided.

In City of Fresno, one of the issues was

whether the reclamation project water had to be delivered in
accordance with California's county of origin law, the very
law that is involved here to some extent, and the Court ruled
no, it didn't, that the Secretary of the Interior did not
have to follow that priority.

Similarly, in Arizona v.

California -QUESTION:

But to get back to my other question,

take out the two states, they build a dam and flood half of
the state to the benefit of the other half, there is nothing
anybody could do about it?
MR. BARNETT:

Well —

Then I would add to it that they would

flood the Republican side —
[Laughter]
MR. B?RNETT:

Well, the reality of these things, Mr.

Justice Marshall., io these projects do not get constructed by
Congress unless the states support them.

That is why this

East Side Division has not been authorized, as I understand
it.

This project •—
QUESTION:

All I am trying to get to is we have got

along fine up until now by cooperating, state and federal.
Don’t we have to get be ok to that?
MU. BARNETT:

Well, we contend that that is where we

62

are, that it .is California that is trying to upset the balance.
QUESTION:

Well, doesn't it cane down to this,

doesn't your position necessarily cane down to this, that you
care partners except that vzhen you disagree the federal govern­
ment is the supreme partner?
MR. BARNETT:

When wa disagree about the operation

or the uses of a federal reclamation project under the present
federal reclamation law, yes, that is our position.

Now,

there are, of course, proposals pending, there are many pend­
ing proposals for changes in water policy.

A number of them

— indeed, there are sane on the President's desk right now,
as I understand it — a numberof them provide for the states
to share the costs with the federal government of reclamation
projects.

Under that kind of a schema, you might have a very

different system.

But our position is that under the present

law, where the state attempts to restrict or control the uses
and operations of a federal project, the f el era! government
must prevail.
With respect to the state-federal cooperation aspect,
I would like to mention also what I mentioned earlier, condi­
tion five has to do with water quality control.

By condition

five, the state board here would require the federal govern­
ment to release certain amounts of water from the New Melones
Dam to improve the quality downstream.
Now, the federal government in 1969 made an agreement,

63
the Bureau of Reclamation entered into a formal agreement,
which appears in the record here, whereby it agreed with the
Regional Water Quality Board of the Central Valley to release
certain amounts of water from the New Melones Dam for the pur­
poses of water quality.

But that agreement had limitations.

The bureau said it could not release more than 70,000 acrefeet a year, and that if conditions were made it would have to
limit the releases to the irrigation time of year.
What the board has done here in condition five is
rewritten that condition, rewritten that agreement requiring
the federal government to release whatever amounts would be
necessary to maintain certain concentrations in the river,
without any such limitations.

So this is an example of how

you have existing cooperation, indeed in this case an existing
formal agreement between the state and the federal government
which this California state board here is purporting to over­
ride, and we submit that it isn't the federal government here
which is against cooperation with the states, the whole entire
scheme of the reclamation laws as we set out in our brief
involves state participation, it is the state here which is
trying to change the rules by assorting these unilateral con­
ditions.
QUESTION:

Mr. Barnett, can I ask one other question?

MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

Surely.

In just looking at your complaint, you

64

didn’t ask for a declaration that all conditions be declared
void, just those that i/ere in contravention of federal lav/.
And there was a summary judgment -MR, BARNETT:

No, I think there is an amendment to

the complaint.

QUESTION:

I'm sorry.

I see, you're right.

You're

Well, it goes on, which are not specifically author~

ized.
MR. BARNETT:
ised.

Yes, which are not specifically author­

If they are not specifically authorized by federal law,

then wa submit the state cannot impose them.
QUESTION:

I see.

I am just wondering if it were

possible if this case wouldn't be easier to decide if the
trial judge had decided which conditions conflict with federal
lav/ and which don't.
MR. BARNETT:

Well, we would submit that that is a

terrible burden to impose on trial judges.

It is not just

this project, it is —
QUESTION:

But you told us to study all 25 conditions

in order to decide what the law is.

You imposed an awful big

piece of that burden on us.
MR. BARNETT:

Well, it might be easier here and in a

sense we have tried to take the burden that the trial judge did
not take.

We think he was wise in declining to do that, be­

cause he probably saw the difficulties it would entail.

Notice

65
farther that under petitioners' theory it would have to be
done forever.

They contend, for example, that you can't de­

cide now whether some of these conditions are inconsistent
with federal law, you have to wait and see if the conditions
are put into effect.

So it would not just be lots of condi­

tions as to each reclamation project, but it would be a con­
tinuing series of operational decisions on their theory with
respect to each project, all which would be brought into
federal court, and we submit that because of the difficulties
of that kind of a process that those difficulties demonstrate,
why, the very suggestion is unacceptable and why the law
should remain as this Court has held in its well-known section
8 cases that the states cannot impose conditions on federal
projects.
If there are no further questions, I will sit down.
Thank you.
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Walston, you have a few minutes left.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RODERICK E. WALSTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS--REBUTTAL
MR. WALSTON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

First, the United States makes the suggestion that
there is no issue before this Court whether the federal govern­
ment must in fact acquire appropriative permits under California
law,

I would respond to that simply that the United States

66
itself raised that very question in this litigation in its
prayer for relief in its complaint for declaratory judgment,
and that appears at Appendix I, page 19.
The lower court, responding to the United States
argument, resolved the issue against the United States.

Now

the United States is arguing that the court should not eonsider the question here.

We think that would be an inappro­

priate way to resolve and pass upon the lower decision in this
case.
The United States also has discussed at some length
the various conditions which were actually imposed upon the
Bureau of Reclamation in Decision 1422.

I caution the Court

that there is much more at stake in this case than Decision
1422.

There are in fact a. total of 12 decisions issued by

California’s Water Resources Control Board that impose condi­
tions upon the Bureau of Reclamation, and if the United
States' claim is upheld in this case then presumably the con­
ditions in all 12 of those decisions are invalid, not just the
conditions in December 1422.
The lower court did not actually evaluate the con­
ditions that are involved in Decision 1422« and thus we don't
think there is any kind of adequate record for the Court to
examine that question here.

If the Court wants to consider

that question, it should either decide that the matter has
been resolved against the United States or must foe resolved

67

against the United States because it did not seek direct
judicial review of the conditions and therefore is barred by
the doctrine os res judicata or alternatively should remand
the case to the lower court so that it can itself consider the
validity of those conditions.
QUESTION;

To hold for you, would we have to disavow

Arizona v, California to soma extent and Ivanhoe?
MR. WALSTONs

No, not at all, Mr. Justice White.

Arizona involved a very peculiar situation that arose under
the Boulder Canyon Project Act, and the Court in that case
construed the meaning of the Boulder Canyon Project Act, which
of course involved a reclamation project that utilized the
waters of many different states, and the Court held that the
legislative history showed that the federal government under
that Act was to have absolute control of water, and that any
other system wouldn’t work because otherwise the project would
be subject to the various and even inconsistent commands of
;

.

different state legislatures.

But the Reclamation Act of 1902

has an entirely different legislative history tfjat —
QUESTION s

How about Ivanhoe?

MR. WALSTON;

In Ivanhoe and Fresno, as we view the

Court’s decisions, the Court merely held that states could not
override specific congressional policy that had bean estab­
lished by Congress either in the Reclamation Act of 1902 or in
later acts.

68
QUESTION:
8 specifically.

But they did say something about section

Do you agree with the language in those de­

cisions?
MR. WALSTON:

There was certain language that ap­

peared in those decisions that was strictly dictum, Justice
White.
QUESTION:

But do you disagree with them?

MR. WALSTON:

Well, if that dictum is construed

against the position ws are advocating, we certainly disagree
with them.

It is possible, however, to construe that language

only as coming to the conclusion that the states had no right
to exercise any veto power over federal projects.
the way you construe the language, then it is okay.

If that is
If it is

construed more broadly, as the United States would construe
it, then we think it is inconsistent with the legislative
history of the Reclamation Act of 1902 and thus is wrong.
QUESTION:

Was the 160-acre limitation written in by

Congress into the 1902 Reclamation Act?
MR. WALSTON:

Yes, it was, directly.

I don't want to discuss the conditions at length, but
I do think that I should note for the Court that th® United
States8 argument before the Court today is somewhat different
from representations it has already made to this Court with
respect to the effect of the terms and conditions of Decision
1422

69
The United States, in fact, advised this Court in
another case that with respect to those conditions, its only
effect — that is Decision 1422's only effect would be to
defer slightly the beneficial use of the full conservation
yield of the project.

Most of the project purposes were per­

mitted by the board's decision.

The decision does not render

the project useless or fundamentally alter its value.

And

actually if you examine the conditions themselves, yovi find
that the United StatesSs former statement was quite true.

In

fact, California provided we think a very balanced response
in Decision 1422 to a situation that Congress completely over­
looked and could not have foreseen when it authorized the New
Melones Project.
Specifically, Congress when it authorized that pro­
ject intended for the waters to be used in a particular unit
of the Central Valley Project known as the East Side Division,
t

and Congress later abandoned plans for that project, and the
Bureau of Reclamation has not developed any kind of alternative
plans for that water.

And so all the state board did was

this, it simply deferred the bureau's right to full impound­
ment of the water until the bureau came up with the plan and
submitted the plan to the state board for its.approval.

We

think this is a very modest exercise of the right which the
states have been given by Congress under section 8 and that
the United States in arguing that the states don't even have

70
this right are essentially asking this Court to abrogate a
fundamental and historic principle of federal reclamation
laws, and that principle which ha3 always been observed in
actual historical practice is that the states have an essen­
tial basic right to control how water is used under the
Reclamation Act of 1902.
The United States in the final analysis is asking
this Court to give it powers that it has never got fro®
Congress/ and we recommend that the appropriate solution for
the United States is to go to Congress and not to come to this
Court if it wants to overturn that principle.

Congress specifically

fully in cur brief, Mr. Justice Stewart.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
The ease is submitted.

Thank you, gentlemen.
