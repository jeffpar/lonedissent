MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi

We will hear arguments

next in 76^1383, Christiansburg Garment against EEOC.
Mr. Sturges, you may proceed x^hen you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM W. STURGES, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STURGES:

<*■

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
This case arises under Title VII of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964.

This particular action began, or had its genesis

in the charge that was filed with the EEOC in 1968.

This

charge was processed arid disposed of by a right-tc~s ue letter
issued by that agency in July of 1970.
In January of 1974, the Commission filed a suit in
the District Court for the Western District of Virginia on
that charge, on the basis of purported authority contained in
the 1972 Amendments to the Act.

The EEOC Commission lost.

Somatime after that, the prevailing defendant, pursuant to Section 706(k) of Title VII, which states, "the court
in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party a reasonable
attorney's fee" filed a motion in the district court for
attorney's fees in the case.

The district court, held that the

prevailing defendant was not entitled to attorney's fees,
because the EEGC had exercised good faith in bringing and
maintaining the suit.

4
Christiansburg appealed to the Fourth Circuit.

At

this time tine Fourth Circuit had followed the decision of this
Court in Newman vs. Figgis Park Enterprises, to the effect that
prevailing plaintiff should be awarded attorney’s fees in 'die
ordinary cases unless there is soma special compelling circum­
stances that they should not be.
Despite this rule that, was followed in the Fourth
Circuit in 'the case of prevailing plaintiffs, the Fourth
Circuit, in a two to one decision, ru3ed in favor of the EEOC.
So we are now bafox’e this Court with the issue
before the Court fairly simple, in a sense? the issue being
whether prevailing defendants and plaintiffs are to be treated
equally in the awarding of attorney’s fees under the statute.
As of this time, some of the circuit courts follow a
double standard, in which they award attorney’s fees to
defendants only in bad-faith cases, while other circuit courts,
most rcicantly panels of ths Fifth euid the Sixth Circuits, rule
that defendants are entitled to attorney’s fees on the same
basis an thb planntif fl .
le, of course, argue that; equality of treatment should
prevail.
In our brief we have argued that the plain meaning

of Section 706 should control, that; the statute says simply
the court may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney’s
fees

5
QUESTIONS

Mr. Sturges, might I

MR. STURGES:
QUESTION:

.

Yes , Your Honor.
I know you do, in this Court, taka the

position, that the same rule should apply to both parties.

The

Court of Appeals opinion suggests that you took a differant
position in that Court; that there you argued there was a
difference between the plaintiff and defendant and that the
standard would be reasonableness as opposed to good faith for
the defendant.

Is that correct, or did you —

MR. S TURGES:

Your Honor, that is what, we argued in

our brief to the Court of Appeals and in our oral argument it
was directed to the rule should be the same for the prevailing
plaintiffs and defendants.
QUESTION:

You mean you changed from your brief to

the oral argument in the Court of Appeals?
MR. STURGES:

Yes, we did, Your Honor.

QUESTION: - I sea.
MR. STURGES:

I see.

Indeed, as we point out in this brief

here, if the rule is not to be the same for prevailing
defendants and prevailing plaintiffs, what is it to bo?

We

suggest it's not to be the bad-faith rule for the prevailing
defendant and the ordinary rule for the prevailing plaintiff;
which is the Court: of Appeals rule.
If it's not to be that, then a new rule from whole
cloth, if you will, has to be construed, whatever that may be.

s
In the —- frankly ir in the circuit court wa suggested

sores rule of reason, but that was very difficult, if you will,
to apply and, secondly, there was really no statutory basis
for that»
If I may add this, by the time we arrived in the
Court of Appeals .in the Fourth Circuit, the hide was running
pretty much against the position that w@ now espouse in this
Court®
In terms of the plain meaning of the statute,
respondents and the amici who support respondent do not seam
to taka much issue®

They suggest, rather, that the legislative

history or perhaps policy considerations override what the
plain meaning of the statute suggests®

In respect to the legislative history, there is no
question that the

first bill that was introduced into -she

house of Representatives provided only that prevailing
plaintiffs would be entitled to the award of attorney*s fees*
/

Of course, that was subsequently changed to prevailing party*
Two Senators commented ir.

debates on very similar

language under Title II, that, if the plaintiffs lost,
attorney's fens could b@ awarded against them*

Indeed, ©a©

of those Senators replied to a statement by Senator Ervin of
Jvorth Carolina that the Act might encourage ambulance chasing,
and the reply was, "Ho, it would not encourage ambulance
chasing because the attorney*s £©c :s could be awarded against the

7
plaintiff.
Now, it's arguable that the legislative history is
inconclusive, but. what is not inconclusive is there is no
legislative history suggesting that: a different standard
■

**

apply to defendants than apply to plaintiffs.

There is just

nothing in the legislative history that deals with that
particular' subject matter.
In view of that., if it's concluded the legislativehistory is inconclusive, then we suggest all th© more reason
the plain meaning of the statute should apply aid the rule
then so provides.
QUESTION: Well, Mr. Sturgas, you keep talking about
plain meaning of thes statute, and the statute just says that
the trial court su<ry axarcit

a

its discretion to assess

attorney's fees oither against the plaintiff or against the
defendant.

It doesn't say that it she.ll — it does a* t -say a

word xhcut ;ii=3 replying 'lir sum© criteria.

MR. STURGES%
QUESTION s

Well, Mr. Justice —

—the plain meaning of th® language is

: and should nest use the same criteria,
talks about the trial court's discretion.
What is there in the plain meaning of the statuta,
in other words, that leads inevitably to th® conclusion that
the criteria have tc- be; identical?

8
There’s nothing in dm statute that

MR» STURGESs

says a different standard should apply to the —
QUESTION:

I know, but there’s nothing in the plain

meaning of the statuter is there, that requires identity of
criteria?
MR» STURGESs

Only that the statute suggests 'that

both the plaintiffs and defendants are, first of all, entitled
to the attorney’s fees,,
QUESTION s

And everybody «.grass with that?

MR» STURGES s
QUESTIONs

And everybody agrees with that,
And that’s what those Senators: said,

that sometimes attorney’s fees can be assessed against
plaintiffs, and everybody agrees that sometimes they can»
MR. STURGESs

Right.

Now, in passing the? statute,

if the Congress had intended that different statutes
different standards would apply, it could, for example, have
juBt 3aid "only prevailing plaintiffs will be entitled to
attorney’s fe&s n ? and then, in that avent, the only circa the
defendants would be entitled to attorney*s fees if they
prevail would be .if the plaintiff hud acted j.n bad faith.
QUESTION:

Well, I wonder if they would ever be, if

the Congress had said "only prevailing plaintiffs shall be
entitled to attorney's -fees*.

I would think it would be

pratty clear that prevailing defendants would then, under such
enactment, never be entitled to attorney's fees«

9

MR e STURGES:

Well , this Court has indicated,, in

both the Alyes-ka cases and in Newman vs. Piggies Park, -that;
the courts have the inherent jurisdiction to award attorney's
fees to either a plaintiff or defendant if the other has acted
in bad faith»
QUESTION2

If there's no congressional enactment to

the contrary»
MR. STURGESs

Well, perhaps my choice of the words

"only plaintiffs are entitled to attorney's fees” was
unfortunateg X perhaps should have said "prevailing plaintiffs".
QUESTIONj

Perhaps Congress * s use of the word

"discretion" is unfortunate to you, too»
MR. STURGESs

Well, Your Honor, the Congress

certainly didn’t define discretion, but {ilia Court did.
QUESTIONs

Well, w;, know what, "discretion" meanss

don’t you?
MR. STURGES:

Well, I read the decisions of this

Court — excuso m&?
QUESTION:

And this happened to ba a

'iaid it should be applied ir th&

10
Now, all we*r© saying to this Court is that standard
should be the sarm for the defendant, if soma other standard
should prevail, or this Court thinks sosn other standard should
be imposed under the Act, fin®, it should be the same for the
plaintiff as for the defendant.

And there's no tiling in the

history that suggests otherwise,
QUESTION:

Do you have to g© that far in order to

support a discretionary treatment?

That they cannot b©

manifestly different s© &s to produ>3® different results simply
because on® is the plaintiff and one is tha defendant, but
leaving otherwise a wide discretion in the trial judge.
Isn't that as far as you need to go?
MR, STURGESs

Your Honor, I think all I need to go

is that, whatever discretion is ssscarolsad ci, for either party,
it should be the same.
Arguments that have been

.-

in the briefs for the

amici, Respondent's amici, suggest iii&t. if this Court were to
rule as th® Petitioner argues, that plaintiffs would ba chilled
in bringing actions under the Act,

W© suggest to this Court

that til at has not happened up to this point, and this statute
has — plaintiffs' attorneys have kcmn awe. r® of this statute
sine® 1964,

Arid, indeed, there has been a plethora of litiga­

tion undsr Title VII,
So wa don't concede, if this Court rules that the
statute means the sarao kind of discretion is to ba exercised

11
for both parties, that this will chill any litigation that
it. hasn’t chiliad so far.
At most, the legislative history suggests that the
purpose in passing the statute was both to encourage litigation
and discourage litigation, to encourage litigation that would
be meritorious and t© discourage litigation that would b©
unsnarl tsorious,,
And the statute suggests that the determinant is who
prevails, whether it’s the plaintiff or the defendant, and
that th® prevailer is th© on© that Is entitled to the attorney’s!
fees .
I guess I can bast sura up, if you will, by stating

what the dissent said in the Court of Appeals.
"The net result w® end up with s.s a result of the
majority opinion, under a. statute which says the court may
allow

an attorney's fee in its discretion to the prevailing

party, i* than a prevailing plaintiff is allowed an attorney*»
fee absent axceptlcn&l circumstance:*, while a prevailing
defendant under th© sama statute is not allowed an attorney’s
fee unless th© plaintiff hat prosecuted his action in bad
faith.

I suggest this is not the l**vel floor the courthouse

demands„"
If we may, we would reserve th© rest of our time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Martin

Very well.

12
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS

MARTIN, ESQ»,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MARTINs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas© th©

Court s
The attorney*s fees provisions ©f Titi® II and VII
of th© 1964 Civil Rights Act are, by their terras, permissive
grants that the court, in its discretion, may allow prevailing
party a reasonable attorney’s fee.

In Newm;m vaPlggi© P&rk

Enterprises f this Court established standards to. inform that
discretion with respect to plaintiff’s awards under Title II.
Before the Court today asra similar standards for
defendants, also based upon the proposition that statutory
discretion is not a license for arbitrary action.

And th©

question here, as it was in Newman, is whether the standards
properly effectuate the congressional purpos®.
How, these standards which are now followed by six
Courts of Appeals state that th.® indicia associated with th©
«.wards to defendants are vexatiousness, maritless litigation,
e?.:usivs conduct, frivolous litigation, or m attempt; to harass
or ambarrsss.
vfc think that fc'h® so-called good-faith test is what
Congress intended, because, Ho® 1, it slacks, th® purpose
statsemants in th® legislative histi:-.ry of-tics ’64 Act;

two,

it was relied upon by Congress in enacting parallel Civil
Rights legislation? and three, it preserved th© enforcement

13
incantive provided by Section 706(k)0
QUESTION s

What ore the SEOC’s mo lives in bringing
$

an action against a defendant, on® of several motives, was th@
feeling that they had a lot more legal resources at their
command than the defendant did, and therefore he would be
likely to cava in rather than fight the thing.

Would that meet

the bad-faith test?
MR. MARTINs

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think the

practical answer to your question is that the courts, in
applying the bad-faith teat, look to objective criteria.
one deposes the EEOC to docide what their motives wore.

No
Whey

look to whether it mad® sens®, whether it’s a reasonable
ground, whether there was in fact, some evidence of discrlminaid on.

They look to the fact that the EEOC has a burden, a

responsibility to advance Title VII*s purposes.

This test is

applied in an objective fashion rather than in a subjective
fashion#
QUESTIONs Well, then, why do you call it a good-faith
test?

Good faith speaks to me in terras of subjective inten­

tion .
MR, MARTIN:

I think in com© ways it’s & misnomer,

it’s a short form for the sot. of indices tint the courts look
to# These are just rsferances.

The courts Lave discretional

grant from Congress, and they look to these indices to see if
something like this has occurred.

14
Now, if the EEOC brought, litigation that was, let’s
say, had a reasonable legal ground, or let’s say a private
plaintiff brought litigation at a reasonable legal ground,
this is a Carrion case in the Second Circuit, but had brought
that ssms litigation already in. another form and lost, the
court said, well, you know, although this is reasonable, there’s
a bad intent here»
So there can be bad-intent causes, but most ef the
time they’re looking for really objactive purposes *— objective
j udgments,
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that all the thousands

of lawyers that are employed in government at on® level or
another, that thero never can b@ some occasion when government
proceedings ara brought vindictively and in bad faith?
HR* MARTIN:

I think that there can be that, and,if

that occurred, that the court; could award attorney’s fees under
this good**faith standard*
There’s no question, I’m just suggesting to you
that «■'**

Discretion

has to be exercised in conformity with th® jsurposes of Title
VII, with the statutory scheme, with whatever there was in the

QUESTIONs

A b&d-fi&itli standard is quite a strait-

MR. MARTIN?

I don't think it is* Mr» Justice

Powell* unless you interpret it as a totally subjectivo

If it includes

the award of fees in casas of frivolousness, harassing litiga­
tion* vexatious litigation.

included unreasonable litigation? a new Eighth Circuit cas®
includas unreasonable:, litigation.

£ think that's a broad

standard and permits the district ourt the discretion to
respond to what Congress

wijb

concccried about.

And what Congress was con ismed shout is demonstrated
by chs statements by Senator.- Humph cey and Senator Lausche
and Senator Pas tor®, and they said that the purpose of these
fee awards to defendants was to prevent harassment suits * to
prevent unjustified suits* tc prevent suits without founda­
tion* and to prevent frivolous suifei.

That would be correct, Justice Powell,

Lst, me give you soma perspective on that.

Each

year the Commission gets something in the nature of 100,000

Cut of all those claims, the Commission selects out

only about 300 c;-r«s®s in which to sue.

QUESTION?

MR0 MARTIN?

I don’t think so.

I think that the

court looks feu a kind of — one kind of case, for example,
where, for oxample this case, where it was a case of first
Impression.

And th@ court said, "This is a case of first

impression, you know, this doesn’t look like abusive conduct
to us."

Now, if this case, if the EEOC had brought; a kind

of action and had lost, in nine Courts of Appeals and the
Supreme Court and triad agiJLn, tha court would say, "Well,
ragardless ef the great motives of the EEOC, fees could be
awarded."

It’s not totally a subjective test.
QUESTION?

How much discouragement factor do you

think the awarding of attorney 1 s fc- 33 too defendants has with
pi aiaviffs?

So far fs the EEOC is concerned, they get their

money from the public tnevnsuxy.

And so far as the private

plaintiffs are concerned, most of them are judgment-proof,
anyway, aren’t they?
