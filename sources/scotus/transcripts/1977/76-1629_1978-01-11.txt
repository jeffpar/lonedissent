HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next: in 76-152SUnited States against Wheeler.
Me. Urbaaczyk, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN L. URBANCZYK, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
IO« URBANCZYK:

Mr. Chief Justicee and may it please

the Court;:
This case is her© on a writ of certiorari to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
The issue presented is whether double jeopardy clause
of the Fifth Amendment bars federal prosecuti.on of an Indian
defendant

under the Major Crimes Act because of his prior

conviction ;Ln tribal couti: of lesser .included offensas arising
out of the same conduct.
The United States submits that the double jeopardy
clause does not bar such, a federal prosecution.
The facts of the case, are not in dispute.
An incident involving a young Indian woman occurred
on a Navajot Indian Reservation on October 16r 1974.

Respondent

was iramsadic.tely taken info custody by an Indian policeman, &nd,
tw n day;.-. .'Later, he pleaded guilty in Indian tribal court to
two minor offenses proscribed by the Navajo Tribal Cocte.
The Navajo Tribal Court sentenced the respondent to
sixty d;.ys in jail or to pay a fine of $150.

4
Thereafter, a federal grand jury mourned an indie ameat which alleged or which charged that during the ©vent, of
October 16, 1974, the respondent had in fact assaulted the
young Indian woman with an intent to rape her.,

Now, that

indictment was dismissed on grounds that are not relevant here,
.and a subsequent indictment was entered for contributing — for
carnal knowledge of a female Indian under the.age of 16,
Nov;, that indictment was dismissed by the district
court on the ground, quote, "that the defendant has already
once bean placed in jeopardy for the same offense51, close
quote.
That; is, that the federal of fens© of carnal knowledge
was dismissed because of respondent’s prosecution and

convic­

tion in this Trial Court of tha minor offenses under tribal law.
The Court of Appeals affirmed.

The principal

componant of its decision and the principal issue before the
Court today is that the dual sovereignty principle which has
applied in ah© federal-state context, to allow prosecutions by
each gov©raiments! auth.ori.fcy for the same offense, doss not,
apply in the tribal contest,
I should point out that there are two other components
of the court’s reasoning that was essential to the decision in
■hat case s

on© was that, the Navajo offense of contributing

to the delinquency of a minor was a lesser included offense
of tee federal offense of carnal knowledge; and tea second is

5

that: th® daub la jeopardy clause inevitably bars the same
sovereign from prosecuting the parson for a greater offers®
after a previous conviction, for a lesser offense.
IJow , w© have not challenged the first of thoi©
components , we have not raised any question as to the relati sn~
ship of the specific tribal crime and the federal crime teat's
at issue in this case.
We have, however, as an alternative submission,
suggested that there should be an exception in this case,
in the circumstances of this case, to the general rule that
would bar the subsequent prosecution.

But the maj.n submission

of the government today, and the issue that I would like to
discuss prir verily in my argument, is that the double jeopardy
clause is wholly inapplicable in the federal-tribal context,
as it i?-; wholly inapplicable in the federal--State context;.
lb© Court of appeals rested, its contrary holding cr.
th-

proposition that tribas did not have the sovereign status
»*

of States,

flow, the Court recognized that although Indian

Tribes ware a separate people that had powers of .internal selfgovernment, that the Tribes were not States because the federal
government las plenary control over th© Tribes.
These same kinds of themes appear in respondent's
brief.
Our disagreement with the Court of Appeals analysis
is not with the premises but with th® conclusion that it reaches-.

6
We agree til at Tribes do not have th® sovereign status of States»
Precisely because th© federal govsraraanf has plenary control
over the Tribes, whereas the federal government's control over
States, although supreme within certain defined limits, is not
plenary.
But, we submit, that w@ disagree with the respondent's
and the Court of Appealsf conclusion from that, that it follows
•fell® Tribal Courts are merely arms of the federal sovereign and
therefor© that th© dual sovereignty principle cannot apply»
That conclusion rests on a gross oversimplification of tribal -of the status of Tribes in this country» And also on an
unjustifiably narrow reading of th© dual sovereignty principle.
To state it

generally at the outset, it is our

position that the Court can apply the dual sovereignty principle
in this context, without embracing a concept of tribal
<■

sovereignty' that gives tie Tribes a measure of independence
against the federal geveammant or that elevates Tribes t*> the
status of States*
The Tribes are not independent from the federal
government.
And there's only two sovereigns in this country, in
the true sense of that term.? that; is, the United States and th©
states.
Ass I will explain, however, the concept of residual
sovereignty is historically and. analytically a correct way to

7
understand powers that — - the ratdasd powers of the Tribes,
And on the basis of tills concept., together with the undesirable
consequences that would follow if the Court of Appeals'* holding
were affirmed in this case.

We contend that the doctoral and

policy justifications that underlie the dual sovereignty
principle apply in the: tribal context, even though the Tribes
are not States,
QUESTION?

Can you answer me one questions

Who pays

for 'the Triu&l Court?
MR, URBANCZYK:
Q UESTION s

Who pays for the Tribal Courts?

Yes,

MR, URBANCZYK:
are paid by the Tribe,

The Tribal Courts — tribal judges
Tribal Courts, the buildings —~

QUESTIONs Are you sure they're not paid by the
federal government?

MR, UPBANCZYK:

Ho, they are paid in til© — this is

not in 'die record, but the Navajo T ribal Court, their judges
are pal i by -she Tribe,
Mow, I should point out, and this is also not, in the
: -.‘-acord, that th® Tribe receives from the BIA appropriations«
QUESTION:

Yes, that's what I thought,

MR, URBANCZYK:

Which go towards the payment, of

judicial sa3.ar.ies
QUESTION:
help, anyhow

And it's not broken down, so it wouldn't

8
MR. • URBAIICZYK:

'

Hell, the point: I want to make with

that, is that there are, as I understand it, no conditicms
imposed on. payment of these appropriations for judges.
Wien you5re dealing with the kind if Tribal Court
which wa describe in the brief, called C.P.R. courts, the
courts of Indian offenses, those are -the qualifications and the
involvement to th© Secretary of the Interior or the Commissioner
of Indian Affairs, with regard to 'die appointment of those
judges, and the payment of 'those judges is set forth in she
regulations at 25 C.F.R_„ 11,3, I think.'
But the point, is that 'the Navajo Tribal Court is
not a court of Indian offenses.
i-

Now, let me chen briefly describe the considerations
underlying the dual sovereignty principle, and explain how
they apply bn this case.
'..'he key cases, of course, are Abbate and Lanza.
Those two cases set forth both a doctrinal explanation of the
dual sovereignty principle and a policy justification which
animates ,tha .1: principle.
how, the doctrinal explanation for the dual sovereignty
principle and unremarkable.

It. is that the Fifth Amendment,

quote, "applies only to proceedings by the federal govemmant,! ,
close quote; and that what is prohibited by the double jeopardy
clause of the Fifth Amendment is two prosecutions by the
federal government for the same offense.

That is why, in Lanza

s
an Abbace, the double jeopardy clausa was held aot to apply.
There was only one prosecution by the federal government:; the
other one was by the State , whose courts do not, derive their
authority and their jurisdiction, from the federal government»
QUESTION;

Mr» Urbanczyk, does — would it impair

your argument in any way if we were to decide in the Suquamlsh
case that was argued earlier this week that the Indian tribal
right to prosecute is dependent upon an affirmative grait from
Congress?
HR. URBANCZYK:

I think that would about finish tbs

principal submission of the government hare that the dual
sovereignty principle applies precisely because that is not
the case, because the tribal power is a retained power which
has survived conquest, arid which the federal government continues
to recognize.
QUESTION: Well, you don’t suggest, do you, that you
cannot, find any statutory authority in any Act or in any treaty
that gives a Tribe any criminal jurisdiction?
ME. URBANCZYK;

I would suggest that respondents

cannot point to any statute, any Act of Congress, —

QUESTION:

You mean a power which the Tribe didn't

possess before?
MR» UPJBANCZYK:

That's —-wellf that's correct»

Of course I didn't se.y that, but I just

said that if you --MR*. URI5ANCZYK:

No, I suppose that even if yo i

conceived that the Tribes had this power, but you find that the
federal government terminated its power, abrogated Tribes, as
they may well have done at the time that they subduad them,
and than :a>-established

e.

form of tribal government as a

creation of federal law, then I suppose we'd have a tough time
with our primary argument, here*
QUESTION;

And not only «— and expressly in c.

statute that said it did have certain kinds of criminal juris­
diction?
Ur URBANCZYK;

Well, saying that they have certain

kinds of criminal jurisdiction may simply be a description of
f'ankind of criminal jurisdiction that the federal government ha;
left to the Tribe to handle on their own, or, the basis of
h- .. r rt

rc powor.
QUESTION:

But it nevertheless is a federal stature

11
that; ssys •— that; is express or implied and it says the Tribes
may do so-and-so but they may not do something else*
MR, URBANCZYK;

I think in — Waller vs. Florida

may provide a contrast, to the kind of statute which yo * .nay save
in mind, Mr. Justice White, the kind of statute which I would
concede would hurt us hare.
The Florida Constitution, as part, of the sovereign
exercise of sovereignty by the State, established municipalities
and vested — and it was quoted in Waller vs. Florida *— \?vu t&c
the judicial power of the State of Florida in, among other
th1ngs, municipal courts«

It is our point here that —• and I think this is
really consistent with the entire course of judicial decision
in tills artaa ~~ is that Tribal Courts are not creations

:>f the

federal government in that sense.
And sc I would submit to you that there does not

exist a federal statutes which creatas the Tribal Courts’* :>r
gives then jurisdiction, although there may well be statutes
V

and treaties;;' which recognizes that the Tribes have this power:.
Well, -die Navajo Tribe has existed for more than
200 years, hasn't it?
Ml,, URBANCZYK;
QUESTION:

That is correct.

And 200 years ago it was totally

sovereign, was it not?
MR. URBANCZYK;

That's correct, it was in every sens a

12
a sovereign nation.
QUESTION:

It presumably had soma method of dealing

with violators of their code*
MR. URBANCZYK:

That’s

correct.

Again this is not

on the record, but I understand 'that there is rudimentary
institutions of justice, I think they were called family courts,
I think crimes of violence ware not too well known to the
Navajo®3 until the introduction of alcohol by non-Indians,
and I don’t think that was much of a problem. So they had
informal institutions of justice, that's correct.
QUESTION:

That is, as part of their own tribal self-

government?
UR. UKDANCZYK:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

This Mr. Wheeler is a member of the Tribe,

there * s no question of that?
MR. URBANCZYK:

No question about that.

I should

point out, tiier©’s no question hare that we are dealing with a
crime committed by an Indian against an Indian in Indian
country,
QUESTION:

Over which the Tribal Court clearly had

j uri s di ctioi .
MR. URBANCZYK:

No question. And whatever the Court

might decidp about the scope of the tribal jurisdiction, I
think it's bean recognized by this Court and by the federal
govemmc-mt; consistently that, with the exception of the Major

13
Crimes Act;, federal — tribal jurisdiction over those offenses
is exclusive.
The point I'm trying to make, Mr. Justice Whits, is ~~
QUESTION;

And we're not involved here with Public

Law 280?
MR. URJiANCZYKs
State.

No.

Arizona is not a Public Law 2 80

It may be only in the sense of asserting jurisdiction

over some environmental aspects of reservations, but not in a
way that affects this case, at all.
It is that respondent simply is incorrect when he
says that, quote, "The Navajo Tribe exists; and functions only
because it was created by the United States as an instrument
of congressional policy."

The Navajo Tribe exists and

functions not by virtue cf enabling federal legislation, but
because in a treaty the federal government recognized its
continued existence, and the fact that it retains certe,in
powers of .1 is original tribal government.
Now, I think that, as I said, that this is established
by the course of judicial decisions, and I would think, I
guess that the courts, from Kagama to Masuria, have talked
about the powers that the Tribe has as attributes of sovereignty,
I think this point is no better illustrated, for our purposes
anyway, tit. on. in Tab ton vs. Mayes,
ha.s perhaps s dispositive

which I would submit to you

impact on this case.

In holding thera that the Fifth Amandment. did not

&ppl£ to tils Cherokee tribal proceedings, the Court rested on
two propositions:

one was that the federal — first, that

tribal powers of self-government, are not created by nor do tiey
spring from the federal government; and, second, that the
existence of the federal government's plenary aut$iorit£' over
the Tribe doss not render tribal powers, or does not mrJca
them into federal powers „
QUESTION:
just a second?

Hr. Urbanczyk, may I interrupt, you for

Under your submission, could the Tribe re-try

Wheeler for the same offense un.der tribal law?
MR. URBANCZYK:

It could have before 1968, —

QUESTION: Before 1969.
MR. URBANCZYK:

— Mr, Justice Stevens; that's right.

The Fifth Amendment, or tile Bill of Rights, the individual
liberties giver, to them, did not act upon tribal courts ,
because tribal courts were not created by the Constitution,
The power to establish tribal courts existed prior to the*
Constitution,; and that is the essential holding of Talton vs.
Mayes,

,%

h« /.ding which has not been overruled and which has

not been, I think, cast, into any serious doubt by subsequent
legislative or judicial decision.
QUESTION: ,

And. Congress could not abolish the tribal

court?
MIC URBANCZYK:
co urts tone s /row.

Oh, Congress could abolish the tribal

15
QUESTION s

I though'.'; there was a treaty.

MR, URBANCZYK:

I think that it has been established

by statuta and by con.vafd.on that Congress can, by statute,
abrogata treaties.
QUESTION:

I'm not certain of that.
Then we’re in trouble now.

I mean, you

can abolish this sovereign school?
MR, URBANCZYKs

As I

suggested, Mr. Justice Marshall.,

at. tile outset, w® think that the federal government's nushcr.lty
over Indians is plenary, and that includes abolition.
QUESTION: That’s why you used the term "residual
sovereignty":, is it not?
111., URBANCZYK:

That's correct.

That’s — the

powers shat the Indian tribes exercise today are powers which
they have retained because the federal government recognized —
QUESTION: With the permission of Congress.
Mr. URBANCZYKs

Well, with the permission, perhaps,

is the correct way of saying it.
I:; we are right — oh, and I should point out that
on

of -she things that respondents suggest as having undermined

subsequent legislation, for example, the Indian Civil Rights
Act, anil I idiink far from undermining Talfcon, the Indian
Civil Rights Act is baser, on the premise that Talton is good
law.

And that without some sort of affirmative congressional

enactment, idle tribal courts, which are not. a creation of the
Constituti os*., are not operated upon by the Constitution.

And so

16

Congress imposed these many —* many of 'the civil liberties
in tile first Ten Amendments, upon tribal, courts •
Now, if we are right that. T&lton is valid, I think
it establishes that notwithstanding federal authority, plenary
federal authority, the proceedings of the Navajo Tribal Court
against respondent in this case was not a prosecution under
the authority of the federal government»

Indeed, if you would

not agree with that proposition, I would submit that you would
have to overrule T niton w. _ Hayeu.'’
And, on the other hand, if you do agree with that
prpposihion, I think it follows under the doctrinal justifica­
tion for the dual sovereignty principle that the tribal
prosecution was not a federal prosecution, and should not be
■■

atruec as

barring federal prosecution that we're talking

about in this case today»
Now, that brings me to the policy justifications
which

the dual sovereignty principle, which I think have

their mesa concise statement in Mr» Justice Brennan’s opinion

for the. Cout in Abbate»
Without such a principle, without the dual sovereignty
principle, la© Court said there, there evitably would be a
conflic ; between t

-o

ii dependent governmental authorities ,

each lawfully asserting jurisdiction, over the same subject
matter, yet sometimes the assertion of jurisdiction by one
thwarting the interest and prosecutorial interest of the other»

17
The predicted result of sut

i a c-enflict is that. on© go-

r meml

authority would be m&da ho relinquish its jurisdiction in

fu /or

of the other»
How, in the Federal~Stat© conflict, it was assumed
that in such a conflict and. -the resolution of such a conflict
might call

for the States to give way»

That is, that the

Congress could displace State power to prosecute crimes based
on Acts which might also violate federal law.

But the Court

rejected that as a desirable solution to the problem, called
it aii. undesirable consequence, and I think basically that that
was the motivating factor for the reaffirmation of the deal
sovereignty principle in this concept.
The consequences of net hiving the dual sovereignly
principhs, X think, would be a substantial reallocation of the
respoiu;:lb.11:.ties for criminal lew enforcement between the
federal government and the State government.
ilaw, these seme considerations, I submit, apply is:,
much the sane way in the tribal context.

We have two govern­

ments lav;fully asserting criminal jurisdiction in Indian
country.

As; tc those the Federal Government has asserted

jurisdiction, and generally the Tribes do not assert jurisdic­
tion .

4

13
The Navajo Tribal God©, for example, does not;
assert jurisdiction over over offenses similar to those in the
Major Crimes Act.

Generally, relatively more minor crimes

proscribed in the Navajo Tribal Code.
So we have two governments, each asserting substantially
different juris dictions In the same country „ Both governments
are seeking to pursue separate interests:

the Tribe, to protect

the peace rad -flignity of their Tribe and tribal members-: against
relatively minor offenses, which otherwise probably would not
be, and I guess under existing structure could not be prosecuted
by anyone «Lse; and then we have the federal government, whose
asserted jurisdiction over major crimes which threaten the
peace and dignity not only of the Tribe but of the nation and
the country as s. whole, the Major Crimes Act I think is. >an
expression of Congress’s intention or of its view that
prosecution of these major offenses is in the area of —•*

not assart jurisdiction over Tribal Code offenses.

But X

That; there might well be offenses which are brought to

on the Tribes by federal enclave law, which are similar

to, you know, tribal offenses.

I can't give you a specific

example, t .it I could safely speculate that there may well be
such a case.
QUESTION; Does the Indian, Civil Rights Act protect
against double jeopardy?
MR. URBANCZYK: The Indian Civil Rights Act, and I —
yes.

The Indian Civil Rights Act has a double jeopardy

provision, which pertains, I believe, to intra-Tribe — two
trib al

p r os 15 cu ti ons.
QUESTIONS

If these prosecutions had occurred in

inverse order from the order in which they did occur, would
•die tenpcacicnfc have been entitled to relief under the Indian
Civil Rights Act? •
MR. URBANCZYK:

I think not, Mr. Justice Relinquish,

Now, in short, the existing arrangement on the Navajo
Reservation consists of two governments, each asserting

juris­

diction over the same subject matter, same territory, yet
each pursuing different though overlapping interests.
I.uw, if the Court of Appeals is cor:met, I think, in
holding tluX; the dual sovereignty principle does hot apply,

I think we can anticipate, or at least there is a potential
for a conflict, a serious conflict between these governmental
inheres tt:.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS W. O’TOOLE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. O’TOOLEs

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court;
'Tie respondent Wheeler submits that the Court of
Appeals was correct when it held that successive prosecutions
in tribal and federal court are barred by the double jeopardy
clause.
The decision is correct for two basic reasons;
The double jeopardy clause, dual sovereignty exception has
never bnen applied outside- of the federal and State areana;
and, setjondly, Indian Tribes are in no way sovereign-like) States,
so as to allow the application of this exception to excessive
tribal ;?uid federal prosecutions.
Additionally, the petitioners claim

that the fact

of the respondent's case calls for the application of other
already recognised exceptions to the double jeopardy clause
must, fa: .1 for the simple reason that the facts of this case do
not support- the application of any of these exceptions.
Before going any further, key facts must be noted.
i

These facts

fully support, the decision of the Court of Appeals

22
and t.i:3 respondent's claim that Tribes are in fact, arms of ihe
federal sovereign.
From til© arrest of the .respondent Wheeler through
his prosecution in the district court seven months later, the
Bureau of Indian Affairs,, which is a federal agency, was in
direct control of the investigation.

Before the respondent was

charged with the lesser included offense of contributing to
the delinquency of a minor, the Bureau of Indian Affairs had
already investigated the possible violation of the Major Crimes
Act offenses*

In fact, the pervasive federal influence of

control over all of the aspects of the tribal life is
strikingly evidenced by the fact that the crime scene was in
the oonpoun 5 of the high school run by a federal agency, the
Bureau >f Indian Affairs,
QJHSTION: Well,, would ‘Ghat have much to do with
jurisdiction?
15:?., O'TOOLE:

Well, Your Honor, this is me re 3.y an

, e;xarap 1« * of the pervasive control of the federal government
over all aspects of tribe-2 life. •
QUESTION: Well, it’s historically true that there's
bean pervasiv® control in many, many respects, but that; doesn't
really go txs the heart of jurisdiction, does it?
Mil. O'TOOLE:

Well, I submit, Your Honor, that

23

QUESTION:

Well, ‘they axa not sovereign like the

■1R® O'TOOLE:

Well; as this Court has long recognized

Excuse me?
A Territory has no residual sovereignty -

HR® O’TOOLE;
QUESTION:

That is correct; it emanates —

MR. O’TOOLE:

That is correct; it emanates from a

grant of power from th© Constitution —
QUESTION:

In what case did we recognize that;

Territories had powers just like Indian. Tribes?
3

that was your statement.

HR. O'TOOLE: Well; I don't think th© language of any
of the cases of this Court has said that; but the language of
this Court in Puerto Rice vs.® Th© Shelly Cg;mpany, in which it

of opinio:» with respect to whether Indian Tribal sovereignty,
in all its aspects, is a creature of federal statuta?
MR» O'TOOLE:

Was it — you deny that it was some aspect of any

27
MR. O'TOOLE;

Your Honor, -the only sovereignty of

■the Tribe, I submit, was the Treaty which the Tribe engaged in
in 1868, which this Court characterized in McClanahan as less
■chan an arm's length agreement between equal parties.

I think,

in fact historically, and as I point our; in my brief, the
Court has recognized long ago, over a. century and a half ago,
■Chat the Indian Tribes were subjected to cession, conquest by
the federal government,’ and entered into Treaties and Agreements
to enable their survival and existence.

States *
HR. O'TOOLE;

Well, Your Honor, although I don't

certainly w;uit to over-simplify it, I think the use of the
phrase

'sovereignty" , -as this Court recognized in McClanahan,

is confusing, and that the appropriate method of determining
powers of sc* If-government; is by examination of applicable
Treaty statutas and law, including the federal regulations.

hu this Court characterized the Indian Tribe in the
recent, case: of An re lope, they characterised it as "once
sovereign1’, and necessarily that suggests to me that they are

28

no longer sovereign.*
QUESTION: Well, I would «.equally think that could,
with equal ease, be read as "once totally sovereign", rather
than "formerly sovereign1'.

It's a sovereignty, is it not?

MR. O'TOOLE:

It is the respondent's submissiin that

the criminal law was an exercise of the congressional plenary
control over the Tribes, allowing them criminal jurisdiction
over certain areas —
QUESTION;
MR. O'TOOLE:

You won't say allowing them sovereignty?
Ho, I won't concede that.

QUESTION: Wall, how can you have criminal lav??
MR. O'TOOLE;

For purposes of limited powers of self-

government, Your Honor, find I would analogize them to the powers
of self-government that the Territory of Puerto Rico has
exercised, which includes local powers of prosecuting criminal
matters.

MR, O'TOOLE;

Yes, there is a Supreme Court of the

Yes, there is.

No, Your Honor, -they do not. The

In 186 8, the Treaty was passed, and I

Well, Your Honor, I respectfully

Again, without: belaboring the point, I submit that

only by Treaties do tha Tribes have these powers to exercise.
And I think it would be interesting if the Court were to
examine the Navajo Treaty of 1868, which reflects that the
Tribes were not given title to their landsthat the Tribes,
at the time the Treaty was entered into, were a conquered and
isolated and exiled people, end that only because of the grants

32

of independence, so to speak, by the Treaty were they allowed
to possess certain, lands,

And the language of the Treaty is

very clear to show that they have no title to these lands, and
that -they are subject to the control of an Agent of the federal
government,
low, from that. Treaty, the Tribe has continued to
grow and expand and tc become more sophisticated in their powers
of self-government, but this has been only under the direct
supervision of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and with the approval
of the Secretary of the Interior,
QUESTIONS

You think it would not ba correct to say

that the Tribe has all the sovereignty that they originally had
except that which was taken away from them by right, of
conquest by the whites?

Ill, O’TOOLE:

Well, Your Honor, for purposes of this

case, I think that submission is academic.

Because, unless they

have • /, -a attributes of sovereignty as derived from the
Constitution, like States have, I certainly don’t think that any
residual 3 avereignty is going to carry the day to allow an
unprecedent sd extension of the dual sovereignty exception.
QUESTION:

Now, why do you say that?

Because you’ve

referred several times to the right of self-government*

I

would have -thought the right of self-government, which I took
it you conceded, would include the punishment by the Tribe of
one of its own members«

33
MR. O'TOOLE;
QUESTION:

Well, --

You concede that;, exists, but you Bay it

exists only under the auspices of the federal government?
MR. O’TOOLE;

That's correct, perhaps my choice of

the word "rights” is inappropriate.

The power, they have

powers of self-government which is a result of federal
recognition.
Nov, not to digress 'too completely, Your Honor, I
think the language of the Indian Civil Rights Act, which was
•the subject of questioning by the Court before the lunch
recess, has a very telling statement in it. And I refer 'his
court to Section 1301 of the Act.
QUESTION: where is it?
III. O'TOOLE;

Title 25, Section 1301.

I don't have

the spudlfi 3 language in tills Court, Your Honor, but I think
it's ta l.li.g, and I would like to quota it to the Court.
It says that an Indian Tribe, and this is Congress speaking of
course, means any Tribe, band, or other group of Indians
subject to 'lie jurisdiction of the United States and recognized
as possessing powers of self-government.
The statute then proceeds to define powers of selfgovernment and Indian Courts.
Certainly it seems reasonable to submit that this
statute is essentially a restatement of the position of the
respondent in this case, that recognition of the federal govern-

the opinion, that it wrote; that -the eistanca of -the Cherokee
Tribe is based upon Treaties and statutes, and the Tribe
exists under the paramount authority of the United States.
And from fcl. >.t point* forward, the Court examined these Treaties
and statutes to reach the conclusion that the Indian who was
in the federal court on a habeas corpus petition was not being
denied any constitutionally guaranteed right, that his lack of
being iadic-hed by a grand jury in conformance with the federal

Treaty under which th© Cherokees existed, as to whether that
Treaty might be an exception under 18 U.S.c. .1152, but; I
submit, that’s -the only possible reason that might be argued
as supporting -this Major Crimes Act prosecution by the Tribe.
Tie silence of the Court on why the exclusive
jurisdiction of the federal government didn’t attach to this
murder prosecution is mysterious, I don't know the answer.
QUESTION;

Mr. O’Toole, were you her© on Monday to

hear the argument in the Oliphant case?
MX, O’TOOLE:
QJE3TI0N:

Yes, I was. Your Honor.
Do you feel that we must decide tills

case and that one the' sans way?
111. O'TOOLEs

No, I do nat.

I believe I make that

statement xn my brief, and I’d like to explain.
In this case the government is asking the Court to
recvgni a Tribes as being sovereign-like States.

In Qliphar.t,

the majority •opinion in Oliphant recognized that Tribes- only
have plmii? powers and limited powers of self-government and
base their decision on the residual sovereignty that th© Tribes
retained absent any controlling or contrary federal legislation
S«), assuming for purposes of argument that the Tribe
does have residual sovereignty which allows the Tribe to
prose cuts r.< sv- Indians, this certainly doesn’t, raise them to the
level of being sovereign-like States so as to allow the dual

38
sovereignty excepti on to b® extended fco Indian Tribes.
So, necessarily, I don't -?ee any great inconsistency,
although I do disagree with the suggestion that Olipliant is
good law.
QUESTION? Well, the shoe can pinch the other way,
can't it,

iso?

Because in this case you have an Indian Trill

trying a me.Tibesr of the Tribe under fch® traditional selfgovernment sole, and in Oliphant you have the Indian Trio®
trying a non-Indian.
QUESTION:

You might have residual sovereignty for

one purpose but not another.
QUESTION:
IQ. O'TOOLE:

Yes.
Well, in addition to the arguments that

I've bona miking, I would submit, as I have attempted to do up
fco 'this point:, that the notion of residual sovereignty is no
longer valid and that any notion of sovereignty, as this
Court recognized in McClanahan, has been merely used sine©
Worcester \l . Georgia, when Justd.ce Marshall first stated it,
only ar a ri.-vru of resolving State and Tribal conflicts.
And, as the Court stated in McClf-.nah._eui and as it has dono in
fch

cases sines McClanahan, it h:s avoided a reliance on what:

it char .cte rises as a plufconic notion, not a means of resolving
disputet , and has instead looked to applicable Treaties and

statutes: .
New, for example, in United States vs. Missouri, which

39
was mentioned in the arguments on Monday, this Court examined
the relationship of that particular Tribe and the federal
government, and found that the Tribe exercised powers of
control over liquor on the Reservation, not because of any
inherent sovereignty, but because of a delegation of that
authority by the federal government»
In United States vs,, Ke®bla, the Court was asked .by
tiis Solicitor, as it is being asked in this particular case,
to rely on the notion of inherent sovereignty to prevent an;
Indian member from asking the Court for a lesser included
offense when it was clearly marital, and they reasoned that the
fact that the Tribe had exclusive jurisdiction over that
particular lesser included offense, it prevailed over that
Indian member’s right to have a lesser included offense in the
federal court»
Instead of relying on that reasoning, or even rejecting
it, I beliefs the Court merely looked at the applicable Treaties
end Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and found that all of
the Indians prosecuted in the federal court should be treated
equally as any other defendant prosecuted in the federal court»
And recently in this Courtis opinion in Antelope,
the Court again, as I indicated earlier, said that the Indian
Tribes ware ones sovereign, and that any attributes of sovereignty
and power? cf self-government ware the result of the exercise of
this Congress's and the federal government's plenary authority

40

in furtherance of the ward-guardian, relationship that, exists
between the Tribes and the federal government»
QUESTION;

Well,, cannot that be read as meaning

such sovereignty as the Congress has allowed them to retain?
4R. O’TOOLE; Well, again, Your Honor, semantically,
I don't think the word "sovereignty5' for purposes cf this case
is an appropriate means of describing that particular relation­
ship*
QUESTION:

Well, as Justice Marshall suggested,

they have enough sovereignty to prosecute some of their people
for a oh a of their crimes.,
MR. O'TOOLE:

Well, that's not disputed, Your ionor,

but I rhi.nlc that for this Court to recognize them as sovereign,
like the S ■

are sovereign, is unprecedented.

The very

doctrine which the government wants to engraft upon successive
federal and tribal prosecution has never been applied outside
of the 3tats and. federal arena, and, in fact, as this Court,
reoogni'-asd In thr recemfc case of Rinaldi, the government itself
pays vary das© attention to this Court's continuing concern
and appare:At distaste for successive 'trials? and the injustice
and unfairness that, results from those trials.
The —
QUESTION:

Mr. O’Toole,. I may have already asked it,

but I've got thisI'm kind of preoccupied with one thought
now, and I’d like to put it on the table so you can discuss it

41

fully and point out: wham I'm wrong.
It seems to me that if prior to the 1958 Civil Rights
Act, the Indian Civil Rights Act, a tribal member could have
been tried twice by the Tribe for tie seme violation, of the
Tribal Code, that necessarily that a violation of the Tribal
Cods by a tribal member was not an offense within the meaning
of the Fifth Amendment*

If that was true then, I would think

it’s still true now.
What's wrong with that analysis?
had that the issue really isn't one of sovereignty,
but whether or not the violation by a member of the tribe of
the Tribal Code, is an offense within the meaning of the Fifth
Amendment.
I think if they could be tried twice in 1S65 or so,
which I guoss they could,, because Congress had to pass this
provision, It must have been on the assumption it was not an
offense,
MR. O'TOOLE:

QUESTION:

Yes.

11':’.» O'TOOLE:

I would liko at this point# Your

44
Honors, to discuss fch© other exceptions that the government
urges ®s being applicable to this case, even if the Court
dess not find that the dual sovereignty exception should
prevail,,
Initially the government would argue that a second
prosecution is allowed when the facts necessary to the greater
charge in this case, either assault or rape, under the Major
Crimes Act were not discovered despite the exercise of cue
diligence before the respondent was prosecuted in Tribal
Court.

Well, as I’ve already indicated earlier, the BIA was

on th© scene and had all facts in hand prior to the Indian
defendant, going to» Tribal Court and pleading guilty.
And I submit that any lack of due diligence was the
fault of fed a government and not that of the respondent.
A further indication, I think, of the real problem
that involvas «*“* that brought 'this case to the position that
it's ai today, is indicated by the fact that it took seven
months to even, bring this case to a federal indictment, and
ihs fact that -she Indian Reservation is far removed from the
0. s. Attorney’s office in Phoenix, there’s a constant problem
of logistics and communication, which is & vary serious
problem because of language barriers with Indians, and these
all add up so real problems which occasionally cause this type
of a problem to arise, where an Indian is convicted in the
Tribal Court, prosecuted in the federal court without the

45
government first; ba coining aware of th® earlier prosecution®
I might also digress for a moment, to point out that
Judge Duniway, who wrote the majority opinion in Oliphant,
also authored the opinion in Colli flower vs® Garland , 'which
recognised that,, for double jeopardy purposes at least, Indian
Tribal Courts and the federal district court are arras of th©
same sovereign®
And with that in mind, that is part of the reason that
I can see a consistent decision of Oliphant and this case in
favor af the Indians la both instances®
MR® CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Your time is up, but,

we've used a little of it, we’ll give you two mora minutas if
you have something®
MR. O’TOOLE:

Well, I would merely

thank you,

Your Honor . I would merely conclude by saying that undar
the very facts of this case, non® of the other exceptions that
the petitioner urges as being applicable so as to allow a
second prosecution applies.

1 think what the government is

trying to do in this case, Your Honor — and I commend them
for their ingenuity

is to ask this Court to enact

congressional policy where toe Congress hasn’t acted at this

moment.
think it would be & — if this Court, was to allow
toe dual sovereignty exception to be applied to successive

tribal and federal prosecutions, it would necessarily 3?aise

46
the very serious question of whether the Court's pronoimcernor?,ts
i». Waller and particularly in Puerto Hi go vs. Tba Shell Compr.s.y ,
prohibiting successive prosecutions within the federal
Terribory, is any more — whether these cases are valid at
the present time .
And on® final not®, Your Honor, I submit that the
case that most thoroughly

discusses and disposes of the

i

various claims of the petitioner is United Statas vs» Ka-gama.
There5s been no indication by the government that that case
is overruled, or that the language of that case is anything
but dicta; I submit that it is very controlling, and that
case itself recognises that Indian Tribes have been subsumed
into tfco Territory of th«t United States and exist only because
of the political will of Congress»

Mr. O'Toole, if you lose this case, what

effect, if any, will it have on the Navajo judicial structure
end its opes-s.-td.on.?

In your opinion.

MR* o'TOOLEs

Well, I think it will have *— as far

as the tribe! structure.! itself, the Tribe will obviously lose
its postuse as being a self-»governing independent entity and
that way — necessarily will hurt the Tribe»
And I think it's also significant to note that no
amicus briefs era her© 'today on behalf of the Tribe, as they
were on Monday in the Qliphant case.

47
They're worried about losing this caso.

I think

that affirmance of th® Wheeler decision improves tribal
sovereignty and gives final finality to Tribal Courts’
declaims as well as federal court decisions,
I've nothing farther,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

-ir, Urbanazvk, d© you h&ve enything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN L. URBANCZYK, ESQ.f
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
dR. URBANCZYK:

Just on© or two very short points,

Mr. Chief Justice. Thank you.
In answer to questions by Mr. Justice Rehnquist end
Blackmun concerning the relationship ©f this case with
Qliphaat, I want to make th© government's position on that
point clear.
This Court could rule for Qllphant and still rale
for the Unitad States.
QUESTION:

Or vies versa.

MR. URBANCZYK:

I think that if the government — if

•the Court 'rales for tha Huguamiah, I ‘think the government
would have a very — I think you would have to have reaffirmed,
•as you have in all othsr cases, -the concept that whatever
powers <sxb stained by the Tribes, are retained as an at tributt

of their sovereignty.

And X think if you do that, 'then you

have gen© a long way towards deciding this case in favor of

the govamnanfc»
3ut. if you rui» for Oliphant, I think there are
several grounds for decision fch&fe are available to you, and
I think there's only on® of those grounds that would hurt us
substantially in this case.

And this is what I understood

Ms;1. Justice Rehnquist's question to b@ to rre earlier.
That is, if you rul©d in Oliphant. that there was no
longer any action of tribal sovereignty, and that the Tribes
exist, simply as a creation of hhs federal government, and
that was the general holding, than I think our principal
submission in this case would be in trouble, because I think
w® would have a hard time arguing that these Tribes w©:re not
creations of ilm federal government and that the prosecutions
under them r®rva not. under the authority of the federal
goveraiT/ant.
3ut any other holding in favor of Oliphant in this
case, the statutory ground 1 think would not affect, the
disposition of our position, ©r would not be adverse to the
government* s position in Uni-had States v. wheeler.
On® final point concerning a statement by the
government Ln-th© amicus brief in Oliphant that Talton has been
mooted, that footnote suggests simply that there in an open
qcastioa, at le&at, that hasn't been decided by this Court,
whether 1153 rests exclusive jurisdiction in the federal
courts, or • rhath&r or not the Tribes would also have concurrent

jurisdiction»
Two thir.gs about, that:. First, of all, the- Navajo
Tribe — and X want to make this clear — does not assart
jurisdiction now over say major offense, like those in the
Major Crimes Acts but., secondly, I would suggest that the
Indian Civil Rights Act moots the question of whether or not
there’s concurrent jurisdiction with respect to major Tribes
in one sense, and that is, that after this Indian Civil Rights
Act, which imposes substantial limitations on the power to
sentence Indians for major offenses, that that effectively
disables them from punishing major offenses; in that sense
it moots that question. But it certainly doesn’t moot Talton
v.

vs. Mayes, and we submit Talton vs. Mayas is still good law
today.
QUESTION:

Does the Navajo Court system assort

jurisdictio i over (a) non-Navajoes or (b) non-Indians?
'’1. URBANCZYKs

it is my understanding, based on

tee 1970 version of the -Havajo Tribal Code, that they do not
assert criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians.

They assort;

the right's io exclude non-members and non-Indians from the
'Tribe

from the Reservation.
QUESTION:

Yes,.

Ml. URBAJNCEYK; And they have a proceeding which is
actually u?te artaken under their ax scutive branch of gove rnment
to deta.rralKii wfcsther or not a person should ha excluded.

He

50

cm be excluded for everything from a contagious disease to
commi feting a crime.
QUESTIONi

Yes.

MR. URBANCZYK:

I am not aware of what; the currant

status of the Navajo jurisdiction is, however.
Thank you,
QUESTION;

Mr, Urbancsyk, before you sit down,, can

you tell ms if you’re familiar with any cases discussing the
question whether a violation of the Tribal Cod© by a tribal
member is an offense within the meaning of the Fifth Amend­
ments?
HR, URBANCZYK;

No, I'm not aware of any cases that

suggest that doctrina,
Thank you,
HR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

Tie case is submitted.
thereupon, at 1:38 o’clock, p.m., the case in the
abo varantitled matter was s Emitted. ]
