MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 76-1058, Central Illinois Public Service Company
versus the United States.
Miss King, I think you may proceed whenever you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MISS SHARON L. KING
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MIS KING:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case, unlike the prior case, does not pre­
sent an income tax question.

It is a withholding tax case.

It involves the scope of the withholding tax provisions and
primarily the definition of the term "wages."
An item is not subject to withholding unless it is
a wage within the meaning of the statute,
The facts in this case are basically agreed upon.
The Petitioner, a. public utility company, reimbursed its
employees in the Year lf)63 for expenses which they incurred
in traveling on required trips on the company’s business.
The Petitioner used the same method of reimburse­
ment.

St reimbursed on the same basis for overnight and non-

overnight trips.
The Government’s contention is that Petitioner
should have withhaid on the reimbursement payments which were

4
made to employees for meal expenses incurred on non-overnight
trips.
There is no question that withholding is required
on any of the other reimbursement payments.
QUESTION:

There is no question it is not re­

quired .
MISS KING:

That is correct, yes.

The district court held for Petitioner.

It con­

cluded that the Government's requirement of withholding on
the non-overnight trip reimbursements was a departure from
the realities of business life and a vigorous stretching of
the statute.
The Seventh Circuit reversed and in reversing held
in effect that

virtually every ifcen arising out of the

employment relationship should be included in the withholding
base and should be subject to withholding.
QUESTION:
if I may.

Miss King, let me ask a question or two,

We are concerned here with 1963 liability, are we

not?
MISS KING:
QUESTION;

Yes, that is correct.
Does that mean that we have the same

issue up for every year since that time, 14 years?
MISS KING:

There are prospective years.

They

are not: before the Court.
QUESTION:

Is there any claimed element of bad

faith in this case?
HISS KING:
QUESTION:

No.
Has the Government attempted tax these

items to the individual employees as far as you know?
MISS KING:

Yes, it has.

QUESTION:

Successfully?

MISS KING:

Yes.

As a matter of fact, the Ahrens

case is a case which involves one of the Petitioners' em­
ployees.

The employee, Ahrens, paid the tax and then sued

for a refund, questioning whether he had an’offsetting income
tax deduction.
In the years prior to this case, the government
did pursue the employees but it is obviously much easier to
pursue the employer so that is why the change in 1963.
QUESTION:

Well, is judicial reaction uniformly

that it is income subject to tax to the employee?
MISS KING:

Every item of reimbursement is

deemed to fall within the broad definition of gross income
but there is an. offsetting deduction for these items so that
the effect is — and it is generally considered that these
items are not income but they are treated as taxable income
and then subject to an offsetting income tax deduction,
QUESTION:

Under Illinois law, if you lose here,

would your client have a claim for restitution against the
employees from whose wages it did not deduct these amounts?

6

MISS KING:

I suppose it would have a claim, hut

as a practical matter, it would just •—
QUESTION:
MISS KING:

Be kind of a theoretical matter»
be impossible to pursue all these

people.
If the withholding statute is interpreted as the
Seventh Circuit interpreted it and as the Government con­
tends here, to include every economic benefit arising out of
the employment relationship, the effect will be; that almost
every employer in this country will be in violation of the
withholding tax provisions.
QUESTION:

Do you understand the Government’s

claim to be as bread as you just characterized it?
MISS KING:

Yes, I do.

As a matter of fact, on

page 20 of their brief in the second full paragraph, the last
full sentence, the Government says, "The statutory !concept’
of wages is not tied to the performance of any particular
service, but includes any personal economic benefit given by
an employer to his employee

as a result of the employment

relationship.
QUESTION:

Do you think that would mean that

employees who worked in an office and that office was heated,
would have to pay for their share of the heat?
MISS KING:

That is a possible interpretation if

we are talking about every economic benefit.

7
If every economic benefit is included, the prob­
lems are enormous; first of all, identifying what is in the
withholding base such as heating and air conditioning and
ccmofrtable offices
QUESTICN:
MISS KING:

Telephones.
Telephones»

After identifying them,

there are valuation problems where there are non-cash items
involved and there are all sorts of problems in determining
whether the regulations which exclude or exempt items from
the definition of wages are still applicable,
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose, since it would oe

pretty difficult to handle the accounting in charging people
for the amount of heat that they absorb or light that: they
use, let me give you a more concrete one.
Do you suppose that it would include a Thanks­
giving turkey

if an employer gave a Thanksgiving turkey

to every employee that was worth — $20, I suppose, these
days, he would have to ’withhold from their pay check whatever
is the tax on $201
MISS KING:

That is right.

There is an exemption

ox an exclusion under the regulations now for facilities and
services — that is, courtesy discounts or a medical center
ox related things, but of course, if every economic benefit
is included, it does raise the question on what the effect of
that regulation might ba.

8
QUESTION;

There are specific — this is not a

statute, but regulations with respect to bonuses, are there
not?
MISS KING;
QUESTION:

Yes.
Yes.

Of even greater significance,

there is a regulat ion with respect to reimbursements for
travel expenses and I would like to say that both the lower
courts held that the amounts here involved are reimbursements
for legitimate travel expenses.

That is not a fact question

and this regulation is so important to this case I would
like to read it.

It is on page 12 of our opening brief,

which is the blue-covered brief.

It is at the top of that

page.
It save, "Traveling and other expenses.

Amounts

paid specifically —* either as advances or reimbursements —
for traveling or c:ther bona fide ordinary and necessary
expenses incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred in
the business of the employer are not wages and are not subject to withholding."
We think this regulation should dispose of this
case.
The Government doss not challenge the validity of
the regulation.
QUESTION:
regulation.

They could not.

It. is the Government’’s

9

MISS KING:

Yes, it is.

And it has been in the

regulations since the early 1940's when the present with­
holding tax provisions 'were adopted.

The present withholding

tax provisions were adopted in 1942 and 1943 and this came
in in 1943 and it has been there ever since.
The Government contends, though, that this regu­
lation should be read to apply only to reimbursements or
allowances where the employee is not entitled to an off­
setting business (eduction but there is nothing in the regu­
lation that says that.
The Government does point to the ordinary and
necessary language which it says refers back to Section 162
and tha employee's deductions but Section 162 applies to
employers as well as it applies to employees and, further,
these regulations are written for employers.
It is the employers’ obligation to withhold which
is involved and sc they are in terirs of, as this regulation
says,

"Amounts paid as advances or reimbursements, not

amounts received and ordinary and necessary expenses incurred
or reasonably expected to be incurred in the business of the
employer, not the business of the employee and as Mr. Smith
said earlier, those are two different things.
The Government in this case has essentially -—
QUESTION:

Miss King, may I interrupt, just to In­

sure I follow this argument?

10

MlSR KING:
QUESTION:

Certainly.
Is this the regulation that provides

the authority for excluding the amount paid on overnight
trips from wages?
MISS KING:

This regulation applies to exclude -—

if you are talking about the Corre11 case, no, it is not.
QUESTION:

I am talking about your company's,

practice of not including them in wages.

You do not include

them whehter they are overnight or not.
MISS KING:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
The Government agrees that you probably

exclude the reimbursements insofar as they relate to over­
night trips.
QUESTION:
MISS KING:
QUESTION:

Correct»
Yes.
And is the reason they agree that it

is proper based on this regulation?
MISS KING:
QUESTION:

Yes. that is correct.
And then, does not your questioning

about the difference between employer and employee equally
raise the question about that practice?
MISS ICING:

Well, I think •••• if I understand you :

question correctly, this regulation is significant because it
uses the word "traveling."

It does not use the words,

"Travel away from home."

The employee's deduction, under

11
Section 162, is based on language allowing him a deduction
for travel away from horae
QUESTION:

and it

The statute does not say anything about

that.
MISS KING:

No, the withholding statute says

nothing.
QUESTIONS

No, nor does any other statute say it,

MISS KING; That is correct.
QUESTION:

And 162 does not say anything about

that.
MISS KING:

Yes, it says "Travel away from home."

Section X62 does.
QUESTION:

Well, away from home, but nothing about

overnight,
MISS KING:

No.

But this

Court in Corre11

interpreted the "away from home" language to mean away from
home overnight but the —
QUESTION:

Over substantial dissent.

QUESTIONt

That is true of a large percentage of

the decisions of this Court.
MISS KING:

3ut the away from home concept is not

incorporated in these regulations and this is, I think, of
particular significance because the Government claims that
its overnight theory was established

just about the time

about three years prior to the time this regulation was

12
issued.
QUESTION:

Is net the issue whether the overnight

concept is incorpcrated in this regulation?

Is not that the

very thing we have to decide here?
MISS KING;

Well, I think the issue is — that is

what brings the ««. ss to this Court but I think the issue is
broader thasi that and that is that if travel expense reim­
bursements are includad in the withholding base because of
the theory that every economic benefit arising out of the
employment relationship should be treated as a wage subject
to withholding, that that is really the question 'which is
involved and that is the basis for the Seventh Circuit's
holding.
QUESTION:

Perhaps they should have written a

narrower opinion 1 ut perhaps that is not really dispositive
of the question of how you decide the case.
MISS KING:

I think that is the Seventh Circuit's

view and that is the view which the

Government is espousing

bare but there in nothing in the withholding provision which
draws a distin; f:xn between overnight and nonovernight and I
would like to go ' n and say that the Government, arrives at
its theory by attempting an equivalence between the broad
definicion of gross income in the income tax provisions and
the more narrow term, "wages" in the withholding tax provi­
sio:!.

It does: this although the word "income” does not

13

appear in the withholding tax statute.
At one time many years ago, when one of the ini­
tial v/ithholding tax statutes was adopted, this was in the
tariff of 1913, Ocngress did try for an all-inclusive with­
holding provision and in that provision, among other things,
they included all annual gains, profits and income,
hs it turned out, the Department of the Treasury
was soon back to Congress saying, "We are having difficulty
with collections and furthermore, those that are made are
erroneous and excessive and it is causing us a great burden."
So in 1942, when the present withholding system

||
t

was adopted, Congress still had the option to go to income
but it did not, it went to the term, “wages."

tax case.

I properly infer from

hh?.u point that you so emphasised that even if you prevailed
•5•

and even, therefore, if your client need not withhold these
payments, they may nonetheless be income to the employees?
MIS,3 KING:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes, that is correct.

Or put another way, wages may not mean

the same as income from a job.
KISS I'-iNG:

Thar, is correct and as a matter of

14
fact, the Government * s own rulings have so said.
QUESTION:
MISS KING:
QUESTION:

Well, the statute says so.
The statute so says,
Income includes wages, among many other

things.
MISS KING:

Yes, they are not synonymous terms.

The Government, in a number of rulings, has found in various
situations that an employee may have an income result from a
payment he receives but the employer does not have a with­
holding obligation and the uniform decided cases, up to the
Seventh Circuit's decision below, in the Court of Claims and
two circuit courts have held that the income tax treatment
to the employee :1s immaterial in determining the scope of
the withholding tax provisions.
And I think it is also significant that, while the
Government places considerable emphasis on this Court's
decision in the LcBue case in 1956, which was a gross income
case.

It did

not consider withholding.

The rulings which the Government issued,/saying
that just because it is an item of income does not mean that
an employer must withhold came, for the most part, after
that decision was issued so that they are obviously wellaware that what the gross income sections say does not
influence what the withholding tax provisions are.
The Government does cite a decision of this Court

15
the Nierotko case in 1946 v?hich does involve withholding
and I think it deserves special mention.

That case involved

the question of whether social security tax withholding was
required on an award of back pay to improperly-discharged
employees and the Court held that it was but back pay is not
the same as remuneration for a travel expense or as a payment
of a travel expense reimbursement and as a matter of fact,
in the social security regulations, there is a provision,
such as the one X read earlier on travel expense reimburse­
ments.

It is identical today.

It was substantially the

same in 1946, saying that reimbursements are not wages sub­
ject to withholding.
Obviously, this Court's decision on the back pay
question was not intended to overrule that regulation and
did not do so.

That regulation continues to have force and

effect.
The Government has somewhat modified its pure
equivalence

argument between income and wages by'contending

that the equivalence does not apply if the employee is en­
titled to an offsetting income tax deduction.
It is not clear how the Government finds support
for this in its withholding provision.

It is not there,.

It is; also not clear how the Government thinks
this system would work.

It suggests that every employee would

taka on the burden of determining what the income tax

16

deductions of each of

its employees is likely to be and not

on a payment-by-payment basis, but it would look on an aggreto
gate basis for the entire year and/try to take into account
trips which might arise based on unforeseeable events in. the
company's business/ it might have to take in all sorts of

considerations but the point is that it would be up to the
employer to somehow decide what the income tax deductions
would be for each of its many employees and for an employer
such as the Petitioner with thousands of employees/ this is
simply an administrative nightmare.
Sc basically., the point we want to make is that
the Government, in arguing the income tax cases, has con­
fused the issue here.

It is not an income tax case.

It is

a withholding tax case and the withholding tax provisions
must govern.

And we believe that the withholding tax pro­

visions are quite clear, that Congress intended that wages
be a narrow term, and furthermore, that the regulations which
have bean on the books since the very outset of the with­
holding provisions preclude the inclusion in the withholding
base of reimbursem mts for legitimate travel expenses.
There i-s a second issue in this case which involves
the question of whether the . a change in an administrative
view about the withholding tax provisions can be imposed
retroactively against an employer.

In, I t?-

nhan those payments were made, there was

17
not ona regulation or ruling or court case which would have
suggested that these reimbursement payments were subject to
the withholding tax and as a matter of fact, the regulations
said quite the contrary»
The Government seems to concede in its brief
that if there is a factual or legal basis on which an em­
ployer may decide that withholding was not required, it is
then an abuse of discretion to retroactively impose with­
holding on the employer and we believe this is clearly this
case.

It would be an abuse to retroactively impose a with­

holding requirement.
The employer, after all, acts only as an agent
for the Government.

This does not involve the employer8s tax

It is merely collecting taxes to assist the Government.
QUESTION:

May I ask when you think the Government

put taxpayers fairly on notice as to its policy?
MISS KINGs

What year?

Well, I think that probably the first

published announcement came in .1969 in its revenue ruling
69 592 and in that revenue ruling, the Government said that
if an employer reasonably believes at the time he makes a
payment that the employee's offsetting deduction will equal
or exceed for the entire year, the amount of the reimburse­
ments which he will receive, then withholding is not required
QUESTION:

It would take a pretty good tax lawyer

to understand what that means.

18

Yes, it dees.

MISS KING:
QUESTION:

Do you think the small businessman,

with no tax lawyer, would ever understand that?
MISS KING:

I think it would be very difficult for

any small business without having sophisticated tax advice
to know what tha : means.
QUESTION:

What about Correll?

Do you think that

constituted notice in this way?
MISS KING:

No, 1 do not.

The Correll case was

specifically an income tax case and given the fact that —
and I might say that Correll was never asked to consider the
withholding tax provision. It never came up.

But given the

fact that even at the time the Correll case was decided, that
there were these regulations, there were the Government's
rulings, most; of which were issued in the 1950*3 and at the
time of — well, shortly after Correll,

there were a number

of cases saying that the income tax treatment to the employee
is immaterial.
I think given all of that, that even sophisticated
tax counsel would have been hardpressed to have; found a
withholding obligation»
QUESTION.:

Until when?

At least, learned the

Government's position until when?
MISS FUG:

Well, until,they learned the Govern­

ment’s position, I suppose when this case began to come to

19
to corns to the forefront, particularly the District Court
till
decided for the Petitioner, so it was really not/the Seventh
Circuit decision came up.
QUESTION:

It was no later than the decision of

the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.
MISS KINGi

Yes.

But even then it is such a broad

opinion that I expect that not —

MISS KING:

That is just impossible to administer.

They said, when you look at the aggregate

of the payments which you think you might make to the em­
ployee over the period of a. year, if you reasonably believe—
for example,, if you, as an employer, reimburse on the basis
of ten cents per mile for mileage and the deduction is fif­
teen, now gone to seventeen cents a mile, then obviously,
there tfould be some excess deduction there which the employee
would deduct against other items but it puts an enormous
administrative burden on employers to try to guess each of
these

Yes.

But it seems to me, after 1969

you may or meiy not be able to make the same argument, is all
I was suggesting,

Well, we are addressing our argument

to 1963 here..
QUESTION:

Right.

MISS KING:

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Smith.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
I think I would like to begin by referring the
Court to the pern: lent statutory provision in this case,
which is set forth at page 1A of the Appendix to our brief.
That is, the statutory definition of wages in Section 3401A
of the Code.

It says that "The term ’wages' means all remun­

eration for services performed by an employee for his em­
ployer, including the cash value of all remuneration paid in
any medium other than, cash."
Now, this broad statutory definition of wages —
talking about “all remuneration," is in our view, consistent
with the congressional design in setting up fch:

.:hholding

22
tax system in 194:: to collect income taxes at their source
and thereby prevaat what had theretofore been the losses of
large amounts of revenue to the Internal REvenue Service and
the inconvenience of taxpayers having to come up with a large
lump sum payment at what was then March 15th and which is
now April 15th at the time of the filing of the return.
Now, the regulations which we set forth at page
3A of the Append!?

similarly reflect this broad congressional

design because they provide .respectively that the name that
you call remunera-, ion, that is immaterial, that is' salaries,
fees, bonuses, commissions and the like and it also says
that it is the basis on which the remuneration is paid.
That is, it could be paid on the

basis of piece­

work, percentage of profits, et cetera — all of that is
irrelevant.

The question is, is this remuneration for ser­

vices by an employee for his employer.
how, the Petitioner in this case has suggested
that what we have done is to fix up things because this is
not an income tax case, it is a withholding tax

case.

But necessarily,» the Code has to be read as an
integrated whole and we do not suggest that all items of
income are wages.
raoai

We are not suggesting that the gamut of

-a set tcui.L in Section 61, which is set forth at pacy*

1A of the Appendix, all 15 items which is not s.n exhaustive
1 i 31 s i s wage s.

23
But we do suggest that the appropriate focus of
this case is on Section 61A1 of that definition which pro­
vidas that gross income include compensation for services
including feess, commissions and similar items.
Now, there is no question, it seems to us, that
these lunch payments here, really, for the same reasons I
have pointed out —
QUESTIONs

Why do you focus on gross income when

you have got a specific statutory definition of wages?

iij
■ 'll

MR, SMITH:

Well, we focus on gross income,

Mr. Justice Relinquish, simply because we think that the sta­
tutes dovetail each other.,

sation, those are really the same things and what they do, in
our view, is to emphasize the purpose of the withholding
definition.
'

That is, the purpose was to collect taxes on what

is the employee's

taxable bas-a,

Xr -other words, that is why, in our view; the
question of whether these items are — the relevance of the
Coryell decision — the question of whether some of these

items are deductible and

1 u

the fact that nonovernight lunch

payments are tot deductible is important because what it
demonstrates to ns is that if the withholding tax system is

to work coherently, it has to be a rough measure of the
employee’s taxable base and in this -QUESTIONS

the thing yourself but Congress has already spoken and am I
not right in thinking that all wages is income is gross —*
MR, SMITHs

All wages are income but not all

income is wages but this a particular kind of income here
that is compensation for services and it seems to us that
under Section 3401 we are talking about with remuneration for
services, you have to ask the question, you know, whether
these people got these payments for services and that really
corresponds, you know, to the Section 61A1 category of gross
income,

MR. SMITH:

No* it doss not necessarily make the

heat a part of the wages but I would suggest that when we

questions that

are impossible to value.

Here you have a large public utility which simply
decides that if a person is going to leave his normal dutystation for the day, he is going to get $1,40 to eat lunch
and if he did not get that $1,40, presumably he would have to
pay fox' the lunch himself.
That, from the Treasurer’s point of view, is a
valuable economic benefit.

QUESTIO'Ns
MR. SMITH:

So you are entitled to it.?
Well, yes, since the overnight rule

involves Section ~- centers on Section 162 using the phrase
"ordinary and necessary," it seems to us that the Commissioner
incorporated his position in these regulations.
In fact, since these things are not deductible,
they do not fall out of the employee's tax base and they are
necessarily included in this definition of wages and subject
to withholding.

I do not think that the taxpayer can argue

36

here that they were not on notice that the Commissioner was
taking this position.
QUESTION:
the Correll case,

On the purpose of this regulation and

is there anything before 1969 that would

reasonably put companies like this on notice as to wages ,
that you are going to apply an overnight rule on withholding
wages?
MR. SHI Hi s

Well, actually, I do not. think the

1959 ruling — the 1969 ruling said that if your reimburse­
ments did not exceed your deductible expenses, then you had
to withhold them or conversely, if they did, that is what
the 1969 ruling says.
Well, what I want to say — in terms of the tax­
payer’s notice position, they have been arguing all along
here that somehow there is a universe of wages and then there
is a universe of income and that they have nothing to do with
each other and than somehow this stuff, while it may be —
those payments, while they may be income, are not wages but
when they coma to their notice provision, they shift grounds
and talk about the fact that they rely on the Hanson case and
the Hanson case is an income tax case.

It was one of the

pre-Correll, one of the appeals decisions of

I think of

the Eighth Circuit which had rejected the Commissioner’s
overnight ruling so the issue, basically, they are coming

tax base is very important, that in trying —

MR. SMITH:

I understand.

Well, the point of the matter is, old case or not,
I do not think that the taxpayer — I mean., the Commissioner
has taken this position since 1940 and the fact that the
courts are in disarray on this question of the deductibility
of employee business expenses, I do not think that it is
reasonable to re.'tv on a single court decision.

I think, as

we pointed out in our brief, it seems to me —
QUESTION:

The other side of it, realistically,

is that you have large companies all over the country with
problems like th ,?■ and they have no motivation not to with­

But it seems to me, when we are

talking about an announced position of non-deductibility on
the overnight and you have these non-overnight payments and
you have this statutory definition of wages and these items
are plainly compensation or remuneration for services within
Section 3401a, it would seem to me that a prudent employer
and a large employer, like a large public utility, if they
had any question about whether or whether or not to withhold,
the prudent thing to do is to ask the Internal Revenue
Service
