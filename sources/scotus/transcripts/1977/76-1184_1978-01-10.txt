MR. CHIEF

BURGER:

Excuse :cnc5j in Minnesota. I must address you as Mr.. Solid tor
General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD B. ALLYN, ESQ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. ALLYN:

Mr. Allyn is just fin®, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court and
counsel:
White Motor today asks you to apply your doctrine of
labor lav preemption to strike down a state: statute, a statutu
wnich, :l: given affect, wot.Id to some large extent make sura
u : ::r ar :v t 1200

sv bo roiirees of a plant that has been shut

uc..r Q'uu their pension benefits*

We • be 1 levs our statute should

not he preempted four thru® reasons.
First of all, Congress has specifically empowered
the state to

sgulat© in the area of pensions*

Soundly, we believe if you apply your standard and
.*:.ixtiosftai case snslysis where Congress is silent that our
statute 'will pass muster*
And, - finally, w© believe that -this limited falls
tn tit area where the state may regulate under their polio®
power to look out for the health and welter© of their citizens*

4
Mr„ Chief Justice , I have ceded ten minutes; of my
argument to counsel for the United states who will address
especially this last issue, and I will try make sure I watch :

.7

clock accordingly.
This case was commenced in federal court up in
Minnesota in front of Judge Also? in 1975,
state statute was not preempted.

He ruled that the

The three-judge panel Sight';*

Circuit disagreed, and that is why we are here today.
if

may say at the outset, it seems to me that the

1

issue before you today is whether or not'a state can regulate
pension plans so as•to ensure that retiring workers get their
promised pensions notwithstanding that their regulation

disregards a provision of a. collectively bargained pension plan
which would permit an employer to escape its pension liability.
Q
receral law

You would not ha making that argument if the
iej

clearly said that the states could not pass

this sort of law, would you?
■"©. iktjjYH:
Q

Thnt is correct, Your Honor.

So, ycu are not challenging the constitutionality

in any substantive due process level.
MR. ALLYN:

Those issues era not here today? questions

c4: due process , • contract—
Q

They are pending.

MR, ALLYN:

--and so on and so forth sera still down

below,-Year Honor, although a companion case that is pending

before you for consideration on whether or not to take jurisarccion aid pass upon constitutional issues other than pre­
emption.

That is called Fleck y. Sp^nnaus, and in that case

a three-judge panel ruled that the statute did pass constitu­
tional muster under these other theories.
I would like to describe to you briefly, if I can,
feh@ act that is h@r© under attack,

it is called the. Minnesota

Private tension Benefit Protection Act.
tui® Pension Act for short.

I am going to call i

It was adopted in April of 1174 by

fehQ Minnesota legislature about four and i>. half months before
ERISA was adopted, the Federal Employees Retirement Incoma
Security Act, and it is very important.

It was designed to

o,.'....Uiutfc! two of tne moat commc-n errors or problems that have
i;:;w into the pane ion plans' guarantees to workers through the
i • '::3‘

Gm

Pension plans that create impossibly difficult

v^cu*,n-:; P-'Ovrsrors; and, secondly, underfunding of the pension

Plim and -chmi disdaining liability when they terminate the
plan.
To meet the difficult vesting problem, the state said
taiul if a pax son works for their company with a pension pUn for
‘tojA oa m&f.e years, they ut, least qualify--their service starts
u’3 qualify, to count to their pension.
To meet the second problem, under funding and liability
disclaimers, the statute set up this system.

It said if ?

compsny wents to go out of business, they are to notify the

6
Commissioner of Labor and Industry of Minnesota, and he in torn
conducts an investigation to find out what the pension obliga­
tions were and whether or not there is enough money in the
pension plan to meet those obligations.

He then notifies the

company &s to something called a pension funding charge, which
is really nothing more than the difference between the amount
of money the company did set aside and the amount of money needed
to meet the pension obligations as they appear at that time.
Q

Do you think that a constitutional right to

travel extends to corporations or just to parsons?
MR. ALLYN:

I am speechless and cannot answer that.

c-onte:aplaiod that in light of this case, Your Honor.
I think my r/tparieace with constitutional law is that soma
constitutional provisions protect corporations and some do not.,

How, what happens: is that the Commissioner of Labor

and these an21uiti.es are nothing mors than an insurance policy

The Minnesota statute

Or® of the critical features of this act ard of course
lies at the heart of this lawsuit, is our statute makes the
company liable for its pension promises.

cannot be disclaimed by saying, "Wall, we are only liabla ins
far as the amount of money that wo in our wisdom deci.de to set
aside in the fund."

it is an important difference, and it will

be more clearly shown as wo go on.
Q

Did the employer’s contributions meet the

requirements of the collective bargaining contract?
MR, ALLYN;

Your Honor, there is nothing in the

collectiva bargaining contract that X know of that space fiev;
tolls them how much to put in.

of fact, is an adjunct, if you will, separate and apart from

The promise to pay the

The benefit levels is in the

The other rights era in the pension plan.

But

it is up to the company to determine how much money they are
going to cut in there to meet the obligations that they are

incurring.
c

Would an employee have had an individual contract

right against White far failure to comply with a promise con­

tained

in the pension plan?
MR, ALLYN:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we believe that

it; is possible that they might.
an action.

No employees has commenced such

The reason I think it is possible is this,

The

B
evidence shows that for the 22 years this pension plan was in
effect the rank and file—the people out there in the mechine
shop and what not—believed they had a pension plan, acted in
accordance.

Every few years there was a negotiation; benefit

levels were increased; people started to retire, started tt
get pensions.

Right up to within a week or two before this

pension plan was terminated, -the company was sanding letters
to employees, telling them what their full pension benefits'
would be,

i be Have there is at least an arguable claim that

there may be a quasi-contract, -argument between the employee
and the pension fund and perhaps even the labor union.

It is

not an issue in this case, but it is certainly something we
have given some thought to.
Q

The terms of the pension plan were in writing

and were available for anybody to see, ware they not?
MR. ALLYN:

Unquestionably.

We do not deny it.

And

•iria fact iiu-.i the pension plan contained this provision—the.
' ' ■'?'"•¥ -

limited its liability to the pension plan.

In other

vorcis, you could not go against the other people and so on.
'brat is in the pension plan.

And the fact that they could

terminate it at any time was in the pension plan.
Q

In other words, consented to by the bargaining

representative of the workers?
MR, ALLYM;

Mo question about it.

Those provisions-

as far as we know, wore in the pension plan from the first time

9
it was ever enacted in 1950, which pre-dated the years that.
White Motor cam© on the scene.

So, we do not run away from tk©

fact that our statute has the effect of disregarding or, if you
will, modifying—I really think it is more accurate to say
modifying—the. provisions of that pension plan.
And the way it modifies it is simply this? is that
when the company expends all the money they have in that fund
to pay off the pension, our statute* permits the state to then
go back to the corporation as a whole and seek to recover it
there.

It has not happened yet in this case.

We have not got.

to that stage of the proceeding.
I think the important point to make here is that
ERISA, Employee Retirement Income Security Act—I assume the
Court has heard arguments about this law before—-'came along
about four and a half months later and in effect has preempted •

So, we are in a peculiar, or :-

There is no dispute either that

ERISA' b -protection does not apply to what has gone on in this
case.
Turning to the facts, Minneapolis-Moline Company ws.o
a resident of Minnesota for many, many years, a farm implomair
manufacturing company.

Starting about 1950 the hourly worker*:

in the plant had a pension plan.

And when White Motor purchcnod

the company an about. 1963. the pension plan, labor agreement

10
and so on were taken over and have continued ever since»
the 1971 pension plan that is at issue hare.

It is

There has not

been a new one negotiated since then.
The plan does provide, as I said, a few things that
ar© different.

There is one other difference, and that is

they would say that sn employee does not vest unless ha not
only works tan years but also has to be 40 years of ag®.
would argue that is different in our statute,
says tan years employment.

I

Our statuta

As a matter of fact, from our

evidence, the number of people involved in this case that •.reaffected by that is tiny.
There is evidence in the record—and I would like
h

to just stata this before we move on to how the dispute cum©
to this Court—that the pension plan through the years was used
to attract and keep highly qualified and hard-working loyal
work fores.
hasp wage

And, secondly, that it was used by the company to

increases depressed.

Evidence is unrebutted and it

is in the appendix.
So, I am going to take issue right now with something

the Eighth Circuit said, and that is that while perhaps the
employees got higher wages in return for not putting money in
the pension plan, it is -just exactly the opposite.

There is'

evidence hare that people worked for the company for 33 or so
yfisrs—ti timek&aperas I recall, and his top salary whan ha
retired %;as 310,000.

11
Q

were not the terms of this pension agreement open

to collective bargaining every time a collective bargaining
contract expired?

MR. ALLYN:
about it.

Yes, they were, Your Honor.

No quastiov:

Every term presumably is subject to negotiation.

In order to defend the content and nature and

And

there is no claim here, is there, that White Motor did not keep
its promise to anybody—
MR. ALLYN:
0

Your Honor—

—as that promise was spelled, out in the pension

plan, which was the product of collective bargaining?
MR, ALLYN:

There is no question that White Motor

wanted to livv up to its promise to get out when it wanted to;
that is true.

I ask you to look at the provisions they are

Q

Are there specific promices in the written

agreement which Justice Stewart is referring to that white is
not living up to?
MR. ALLYN:
Q

Well, if you will—

The question can b© answered yes or no.

MR. ALLYN:

-Under ray view of the facts, yes.

Th©

part they are not living up to is the pension promise. Your
Honor.
Q

That is, you

are referring to some specific

provision in th© written pension agreement?
MR, ALLYN;

The pension plan says that you work for

so many years, you coma to retire.

A benefit level is computed,

based upon all the numbers—
Q

Yon just do not went to look at all the pm is

it boyov

promise says, "But we do not need to do

a certain point if certain things happen.”
MR. ALLYN;
Q

That is true, Your Honor.

Is that s. premise that is being breached or not?

MR. ALLYN:

The statute has th® effect of disregarding,

if you will, the term of the collectively bargained pension
plan.
Q

So, feh® statute is changing the contract the

13

parties made?
MR. ALLYN:
Q

I would agree with thata

Was there a contract clause claim made in this

case at all?
MR. ALLYN:
Q

And that has not been resolved?

MR. ALLYNs
in

e,

Yes.

It has not been resolved in this case.\

similar case it has been resolved as far

as the District

Court three-judge panel, and they resolved it against the
company.

But let me address what the Chic-5f Justice I belle\

is getting at, Your Honor.
Q

I think all three of us in the last three ques­

tions are all directed at the same proposition.

Has thin

cuahute—has the Minnesota legis.latura engrafted a new term or
pro--: is ion on the contract, on the collective bargaining con­
tract?
MR

ALLYN;

The answer is that, it has added an

additional obligation.

So, I do not mean to fence it in.

I

am trying to—
Q
tion.

More than one, more than one additional obliga­

terminating.

And it*, has prohibited the company from

All three of those are terms additional to the

pension plan that was negotiated, are they not?

14
MR. ALLYN:

Your Honor, it did not prohibit; the

company from terminating the pension plan.

That is not so.

The statute doss not prohibit them from terminating the plan
at all.

What it said was that when you terminate the plan-—
Q

You have to pay a good deal of money.

MR. ALLYN:

And if there is not enough money in the

plan, then you can look to the assets of the corporation.
Q

It is a distinction without, a difference.

can terminata the plan, but you have to pay up as though

You
it

ware not.
MR. ALLYN:

You have to pay up to the pension

promises that the workers thought were made.
The contract clause issue here is a. difficult-one.
I think v;« can establish—
Q

Is that issue here?

MR. ALLYN:

No, it is not, and maybe I had better

avoid it right now.
Q

I think it is & supremacy clause issue here»

MR. ALLYN:
Q

Yea, it is, Your Honor.

W© believe—

Which we normally would reach first.

MR. ALLYN:

Yes, Your Honor.

We believe thet you should, in deciding this case,
La

ha .Lnsue before you, look to see whether or not

Congress has evidence, belief or intention that the states
could regulate pans ion plans over and above, any kind of contract

15
plan.

And we argue that the Pension Disclosure Act of 1950.

plus the adoption of ERISA, is evidence of the fact that
Congress believed the states were free to regulate the
administration and operation of pension plans..
Q

Nobody quarrels with the thought that a state

could make it a criminal offense to embezzle these funds

ct

even to impose preventive procedures to prevent misuse ef r,h • ■ r
funds and so on.

But this is changing th© substantive terms

of it, which is quit® different from regulating, is it not?
MR. ALLYN:

Your Honor, it could be, but in our case,

when you look at th© language in the statute, the specific
language, to roe what Ccngrass intended and then match that tv
the kind of ills and the problams that Congress was looking at"—
there was underfunding, liability disclaimers, difficult
vos v1ng rrovisions.
Q

But those: were all provisions agreed to by both

of the negotiating parties to the contract, were they not?
MR. ALLYN:
Q

No question about It,, Your Honor.

Was this a compulsory subject to bargaining, do

you think, under the federal law?
MR. ALLYN:

1 think pension plans are no doubt a

compulsory subject to collective bargaining.
Q

Do you think that a state could have said,

'■'Awfully sorry, but nobody may adopt a pension plan"?

MR. ALLYN:

No, I do not. Your Honor.

16
Q

And could they say, "Nobody can adopt a pen?io.-.-

plan unless our Diractor of Labor consents”?
MR. ALLYN:
Q

No, I do not, Your Honor.

Could they say every collective bargaining

agreement; must contain a pension plan?

Could the state say

that?
MR. ALLYN;

No, Your Honor.

No, we do not.

plan, look out for those people that you have been making a

And. I think that that has

ration, administration, of

ponsIon flan.

If you do not put enough money into it, what

kind of pension plan do you have?

Q

How do you distinguish the 0liver case?

MR, ALLYN:
fcsw secords.

Thank you, Your Honor, in my remaining

Oliver, we- believe, is dramatically different.

In that case the state statute struck down th® heart of the
vee,® structure.

There is no question about it.

The state

antitrust statute.
Our statute did not come along end mandate or strike
down the heart of 'the pension plan.

As a matter of fact, our

statute has 'the effect of upholding what we would say is
certainly the intention of most of the people, the employees,
that they thought and planned on for over 22 years,.
Q

So—

The federal law is that you do not force parties

17

to coins to an agreement.

You ought to bargain it out.

And the

state is in effect saying that if you are going to bargain
about this, you must have one—there is one thing you cannot
agree to, you cannot agree to a no-pay termination.
MR. ALLYN:

what we", are saying is that if you ar<: going

to terminats,your company has got to look to its assets to stand
behind the pension obligations and you cannot just escape by
having a pension fund and not putting any money in it.

I do not

maan to imply they did not put any money in it.

There are some

small bun®fits now being paid to these workers *

We

claiming here they are at death's door.
Q

C an a state put on a minimum wage—

MR. ALLYN:
o

Yes, Your Honor.

—higher than the bargained-for wage?

MR. ALLYN:

Congress has said it can set minimum
So, 1 guess, yes.

The answer is yes.

If

Congress say a we ear. do it; then w© can d© it.

And you think it has said this about pension

plans?

And

This is really c.\

In Oil vox* you do not have any kind of

congressional statement to the state, "Go ahead and set up an
antitrust law to prohibit the kind of thing they were after.”
In our situation Congress said in the Pension Disclosure Act

18
and in ERISA indirectly that—
Q

l understand your independent argument based on

evidence of congressional intent to leave the states—but
putting that to one side, is there any distinction?
MR. ALLYN:

I 'think there is no question, and we

admit that our statute varies the term of collective bargaining
agreement.

It is, in our judgment, so minimum and so not

contrary to the purposes of the NLRA, we would ask you to look
at that and net®—
Q

Minimal?

MR. ALLYN;
time is up.

Seventeen million dollars?

All right, let me just clear that up.

y

The fact of the matter is since the $19 million

assessment was set, the commissioner holds a hearing and at

th-r.t hearing it is for certain going to bo reduced by $7 million
which is the amount in the so-called guarantee letter they set*
I

a going to be reduce d by the amount of money they have now

put in their nsw pension plan in the plant and the amount of

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN A, RYAN, JR., ESQ.,
AS AMICUS CURIAS
MR. RYAN;

Mr, Chief Justice, may it please ih©

Court:
The United States supports Appallax.it Malone in this
action, and we

urge that the judgment belew be reversed.

In

our view, the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the
National Labor Relations Act preempted the authority of the
state to enact the Minnesota Pension Act.
The law of preemption is largely judge made, but
its constant touchstone is the presumed intent of Congress,
and w© think that in this case the intent, of Congress is clear.
It was expressed in the Disclosure Act of 1958, which we disc-'.ss in our brief •

That, act required that the financial

ope::.?tio* 3 of pension plans be mad© public.
and I quota:

But Congress said,

;iia leave to the state thr detailed regulations

relating to in©©ranee, trusts, and other phases of the pension
plan's operations," and quote.

And, quoting again, "This

legislation by design endeavors to leave regulatory responsi­
bility to the states."
Q

Do you. think the state could forbid a pension

plan?
MR. RYAN:

I do not think that, Mr. Justico. White,

because--Q

Could it forbid a pension plan unless it provides

20
no cancellation?
MR. RYAN;

It could in effect provide that any

pension plan written in this state must have a termination
insurance program.
Q

So, I would answer that question yes.

Could, it provide that any pension plan in tv. ■

state must provide at least 60 percent of the wages earned in
the last three years of employment?
MR. RYAN:
Q

Notwithstanding a prior agreement?

MR. RYAN:
Q

I think it could under this scheme.

Yes f not—

I am speaking of an act passed now-—that is what

w© have, an act passed long after a collective bargaining
agreement had set. up a pension plan.
MR. RYAN:
Minrcsot?

7. think the retroactivity question of the

legislation is, not before the Court now.

simply a question of
Q

whether—

It is retroactive, is it not?

MR. RYAN:
Q

It is

It is retroactive, indeed•

Yes.

MR, RYAii'

But I think that the question

of whether

Minnesota can pass this statute and impose its terms on the
parties is not before this Court except fer the preemption,
the supremacy clause argument.
Q

This is even though pension payments might be

called part of wages?

21
*

MR. RYAN:

In an industrial sense, yes, they might

b© called a part of wages.

But that is to say no more than if

Congress sets a minimum wage of $2 and says the stakes can go
higher, then Minnesota could certainly say the minimum wage in
this state is $3, and it could require the parties to stop—
Q

And why is that?

MR. RYAN:

Because Congress has said in—I believe

it, is the Fair Labor Standards Act—Congress has said the
stakes can go higher.

And we submit that in this case

Congress has said in the Disclosure Act, in the pre-ERISA day ,
Congress said, "And the states can regulate pension plans."
Q

It has said that, but you are just saying that

means almost everything, including the termination dates, level
of payments.
MR, RYAN:

It includes everything Congress had in

mind when it said stairs a my regulate pension plans.

And we

think the Disale;sure Act supports the conclusion that that
includes the ability of the state to say that pension plans
thall be

,f a certain level of benefits ,-md so forth.

It does

not include the state saying, "There shall be no pension plans'1
ox” the state saying, "There must be a pension plan," because
uhde

Inland Steel that is a mandatory subject of bargaining,

ev.d the stats cannot say otherwise.
Q

Your submission is at least it is very clear

that the::3 are some things a state can do that the parties to

a collective bargaining agreement cannot agree not to do?
MR. RYAN:
Q

Yes.

MR. RYAN:
Q

That, is correct.

Or some things,, anyway.

MR. RYAN:
Q

Cannot set aside.

There are some things.

Would this be one example, that the state law

would require that no official of the union be a trustee of the
pension fund and that no official of the. company bs a trustee,
that it must be a mutual and independent trustee?
MR. RYAN:

l believe before ERISA that would be a

permissible stats regulation because I believe the Disclosure
Art docs not address that.

Therefore, it is one of those

vhi gs iJ at Congress left to the states.
Q

That would be regulation without any substantive

change, however, would it not?
MR. RYAN:
Q.

It would be.

I take it then your position also is that absent

the Disclosure Act, there would bs preemption?
MR. RYAN:

Absent fens Disclosure Act, that is not our

That is true.

Would you say despite that, the state would have

MR. RYAN:

Despite that, the state would have the

Wa believe the Court of Appeals was wrong in one

respect when it said in effect that the states have only the
power that the Disclosure Act of 1958 gave to them.
the opposite is the case.

We think

The state had plenary power, except

what, the Disclosure Act took away from them and except for
interfering with the doctrine—
Q

And what the National Labor Relations Act might

havo taken «way from them?
MR. RYAN:
Q

Of course.

Do ycu. think the state could pass a law saying

that any wages bargained for in a collective bargaining unit
agreement have to be paid fcha day after they axe earned,
regardless of any provision to the contrary in the collective
bur g a ini a- g a j roe/ lent?
MR. RYAN:

I would think that that is probably a matter

wheru the stabas would be preempted by the National Labor
Relations Act.

So, the—

24

Q

Why there and not her©?

MR. RYAN:

Because I think in this case Congress left

regulatory responsibility of pension plans to the state.
Q

1 thought your argument did not depend on if

this were the withholding act; it was just the plenary powers
of the state had not bean removed by the withholding act»
MR. RYAN:
Q

Well, the Disclosure Act.

Certainly Congress has never even addressed

itself to the subject when wages should be paid.
MR. RYAN:

Following the National Labor Relations

Act; in the years between that, act and 1958 when the Disclosure
Act was passed, I think it would have been, a nice, question.
It would he.--: fce.s« a. difficult question.

I think in 1958, fi

the:, until 1974, Congress made it an easy question.

They said

specifically we leave regulatory responsibility in this area
of pension regulation to the states.

In 1974 they took it away.

B:t Ft least in those If years?, if not before, the states had
the power to do this.
q

Gould fchv state legislature provide that th>~

mi?: Iroum increase each year in collective bargaining negotia­
tions must reflect the Bureau of Labor Statistics cost of
living?
MR. RYAN:

I think not, Mr. Chief Justice.

that gets too does to—perhaps I speak too soon.

I think

If, as we

nssurae, the statos can set a minimum wage higher than tho

25
federal vage--and I think that is true, and Congress has
specifically said so in the Pair Labor Standards Act—-then I
misspoke.

There would be no problem in the state saying the

minimum wage in this state is whatever the federal index is,
plus two percent, or whatever they choose t© do.

The states

do have the power in the wage area to set a higher minimum
wag? than the federal minimum wage.
Q

My question did not go to minimum wages.

It

gees only to the annual negotiations, at which time the Labor
Act certainly guarantees the employer the right to say no
increase at all, does it not?
MP.. RYAN:
Q

It normally would, yes, sir.

Normally.

MR. RYAN:

Not always?

Is your question, Mr. Chief Justice, a

."bate act that speaks only to collectively bargained agree­
ments and not to others?
Q

All.

I oa simply saying that the employer now

hac a right surely, under the labor lav;, to say, ”1 am very
'

«sorry; bt sin-ass is very poor.
this year . "

Do you agree with that?

MR. RYAN;
Q

We cannot give you any increase

Yes.

Even though ho then listens and takes part in

bargaining in the usual way.

But you say the legislature could

come along and say, "The starting point is 6.3 percent increaf .
because that is what the Bureau of Labor Statistics has

26
designated as the increase in cost of living?
MR. RYAN:

On those facts, I would say no,, because

then you are not- talking about a minimum wage; you are talking
about a worker who might: be earning $20,000 a year is still
entitled to a 6.3 percent increase this year, and that is not
/

a minimum wage provision, and that is preempted by the
National Labor Relations Act.
Q

Mr. Ryan, assume you did not have

the Fair

Labor Standards Act’s express recognition of the state's
power to set a minimum wage; you merely had the Wagner Act
and the Taft-Hartley Act.

Would the state have the power to

set a minimum wage higher than a contract wage?
MR. RYAN:

in our view, no, Mr. Justice Stevens, it

would not.
Q

Because of the- —

MR. RYAN:
Q

Even if it was statewide?

MR. RYAN:
Q

Because of the preemption.

Evan if it was statewide.

Because of the collective; bargaining system; is

that it?
MR. RYAN:

Because it would bo preempted by the

Fair Labor Standards Act.
Q

There is an explicit provision—

I understand that.

But suppose there were no

Fair Labor Standards Act at all.
MR. RYAN:

Suppone there were no Fair Labor Sttmd&rns

Q

I thought that was Mr. Justice Stevens—

MR. RYAN;
Q

Oh, I am sorry.

Assuming no Fair Labor Standards

the

State of Minnesota decides the minimum wage in Minnesota is
going to be $5 an hour and every collective bargaining agree­
ment may have only reachad $4 an hour.

Are you saying the

state has no power to do that?
MR. RYAN;

No.

The question that 1 was answering—

I misunderstood you—was that if there war© no provision in
•the Fair Lator Standards Act saying the states can go higher-Q

That is right.

I am assuming there is just no

federal ctaiuto at all on the minimum wage,
MR. RYAN;

Does your question assume there is federal

minimum wage or not?
Q

No.

MR.'RYAN:

Q

Yes.

MR. RYAN;
Q
is it not?

I see.

That is a difficult question, I must say.

It is the same question that this case presents,

MR. RYAN:

No, I do not think it is the same question

that this case presents.

The difficulty in that question—

thar© is no such thing as an easy labor preemption question.
I think we start from that point.

And in your hypothetical,

sir, I think it would be a vary, very difficult question
because you would have to set aside 20 years or 30 years of
congressional history end go back than.
Q

Is there any case close to that except Oliver?

Oliver .is like that, but what othsr casso say that a state
cannot affect th© end result cf th® bargaining process as
opposed to the process itself?
MR. RYAN:

A case that says a state cannot affect

the end result of the bargaining process?
C

Cannot dictate what terms the parties may &gr:s©

upon.
MR. RYAN:

I think—and I do not have the citation—

but I believe there am cases, if not from this Court then
from lower ones, which uphold the authority of the states to
set, for example, writing requirements or sanitary standards,
things of that natura.

I do not have the citations but I think

it is that police power exception, if you will, or the health
and welfare exception, which we think is the wall spring from
which the 1.358 act comes in this case.

We think that "58 act

fits in very comfortably with the history.

Congress has

demons teratoid intent to preserve to the statas their health,

29

Q

I take it year first assumption is you do not

have to reach these tough questions because of the Disclosure
Act—
MR. RYAN;
Q

Yes.

--shat Congress has expressly saved state

power.
MR. RYAN:

That is our position, Mr. Justice White,

asd I think the Disclosure Act, I would say,

as augmented by

the legislative history of ERISA—we think those go hand in
hand.

But that is our position, that this Court in this case

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK C. HEATH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. HEATH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it. pleas®

the Court:
To hear the argument and t© read the briefs of the
state and Labor Board, as I call the other brief, on® would
think that there are grave questions of fact undecided in this
question of preemption.

And that is not true.

Let us restate

the operative facts that relata to the question of preemption.
Counsel inferred and I think said that there were
labor contracts negotiated but not pension plans and that the
pi. r «ion plans did not say what funds had to be put in.
is not right..

That

All the pension plans, from the first pension

plan in 1950, wee 3 collectively bargained.

thv o plicis ivf* collectively b «rgained.

Every amendment to

Those plans were made:

and pares 1 of collective bargaining agreements.

Every

umvion pic.;; that was negotiated contained pension schedules
• i.d ru.it i a r separate but ;.3 a separate provision but as part
of the contract itself.
T* ) very Important provisions which are clear and
unambiguous and were not put in fin® print.

One, Section 009

of the Pension Plan, 11 Pension shall be payable only from tho
fund, and rights to pensions shall bn enforceable only ag;
the fund,,”

And in s separate section ©f the plan which, if you

pleas©, was collectively bargained and negotiated and ratified

34

by the union— "Neither the company nor any trustee or pension
committee or any member thereof shall be liable therefor"—
therefor being payment of pension benefits- ~ " in any manner or
to any extent."
We do not have here a promise* and the state would
like -to say a disclaimer of a promise.

That is made clear

when you understand what pension plans were like and the kind
of problems that -arose from funding of pension -plans.

When

pension plans were put in for the first time or when they are
increased, credit is given to service of employees, not. just
service that they will have from that point forward but service
that has taken place in the past, perhaps not only with this
employer hut with predecessor svcployerc.

Th& result is in

giving credit for that» you get a paper figure, and I will
explain it in a minute.
liability.

That is called a past service

It is a contingent, liability because it comes into

play only if the pension plan continues in effect, only if the
cpl©yvi: cc/.tc'

;;. in employment to qualify for a full pensio,

c' at, Lsv st; if ha quits, baa enough service to qualify for a
a tarred vested pension..
Unions—and the UAW that negotiated most of these
'csc -ritfi is a strong, experienced, and knowledgeable
American union—they and other unions recognized that the only
way to ge t agreements or-, pensions was to have a deferred fund lag
arrangement under which past service liability—this credit

35
system—would be paid over a period of many years,

fed that

was provided in this plan in 1971,, which is the key point.

Ths

pension plan by negotiation provided that these credits that
were given to employees for past service would be funded ever,
a period of 35 years, a long time and created uncertainty.

But

to have what Minnesota has decreed here, instant funding, would
create a situation which would make it impossible for companies.
And they would not have agreed to pension plans because if
they put a pension plan in, five or ten years later the plant
had a misfortune and they had to close it, they would have a
liability that would be out of all proportion to what they
could stcind.
Sep the,re was a reason for deferred funding, which
was common.

What that background, what was the situation in

1971?
As I said, there was an agreement between "die union
atd ths company, the union being the collective bargaining
scant for all these employees.

There was an agreement for

35-yaar funding, which I have just described.

The union knew

in 1971 that during the three-year period from ’69 through '71
this far;; division of Whits Motor had lost $21 million.
saw

The

beinc knowledgeable also was aware of the fact that the

plan, was fax* from truly funded.

And in that situation, although

the company already had for 871 an agreement that we will put
in so many dollars each year to fund this over a long term, the

35
union came in—-and this is a great, example of collective
bargaining—the union cam-® in and said, "We are concerned.

Wa

want to bargain with you about guaranteeing pensions if the
plant is closed and the plan is terminated."

And that is what

the very pension guarantee that was negotiated in 1971 said,
and that is on page 172 and 173 of the appendix.
provides for just that circumstance.

It expressly

And the?, union in the

circumstances, whan you Consider that it was dealing with

i

company that was suffering losses, did a remarkable job because
they obtained from White an agreement in addition to its
■handing obligation . that if through unfortunate circumstances
this plant were closed, Whit® would guarantee pensions at a
certain lev-nl which actually, as the record shows, produced an
additional obligation of $7 million,

what White agreed to

are pensions for years of service with White itself
at the level provided in the 1968 plan and agreement, end
lower psr.sicns for yrars of service with prior employers.
That was the situation in 1972.

The unfortunate

circumstances resulted in the closing of the plant.

We let you g©

That is right,, but what they

did in 1974, 20 days before the agreement was to terminate,
was to come in and change the qualifications for eligibility
for vested pensions, impose on the company in the event of
termination of the plan immediate payment through annuities of
all pensions, instead of the limited liability through defarr*.d
funding„
Q

What if under the collective bargaining agree­

ment there had bean extensive provisions, .assuming the company

•yo/ rs r tc" the State of Minnesota enacts' a provision
is much more stringent than that provided from the
,' ' ' cti'bargaining agreament.

Would that, in your view, be

preempted?
MR. HEATH;

That depends on how this Court interprets

what is called its local interest exception and the safety and
health provisions set forth in Oliver.

That could be preempted

irsdr.\ t\’i rather tight standards which seem to be in machiuis ks
aad see:a tc be safe in the two bus employes cases.

On the

other herd, strictly on the language of Oliver, where that ic

38

And 3: ;m

not in a position to tall you precisely where that point is .
Your Honor.

But I am in a position to say to you that the la act.

safety and health regulation referred to in Oliver and included
in the local interest exception doss not include—as the 'rtarr
and the solicitor general argue—it does not include all actions
taken for economic welfare of employees or all actions taken
for the general well being of employees because, if so, you
wipe out completely the doctrine of labor law preemption, and
with it you seriously undermine collective bargaining.

Q

It would cover a situation arguably, a situation

such as my Brother Rehnquist has described and certainly a
situation such as this, assuming this were a trucking company

/jiC the

v^i:; ■; chivy bargaining agreement had provided that it

was the duty of all drivers to do their best to drive at a
rnt speed of

60 miles an. hour, and than the state had

-vuch later but during the existence of the collective bargain­
ing agree:mu.fc had reduced the speed limit to 55 miles an hour.
\ .sre is no question about the state's power to do that .and no

qvaction about preemption, is there?
MR. HEATH;
Q

No, I have no question about that.

A:.’d that is what the local safety and health

interest means.
MR. HEATH:

That is what it means*

As I read the

cases, there may b& some variation in hew far the local safety

39
and health goes.

But it. does not go t© economic benefit

because, if so, it would do what nobody can say Congress
believed should be. dons.
Q

It. would wipe out ih© pans ion.

A state could not have lesser standards thaa

the federal Mine Safety Act, could it?
MR. HEATH:

No, I do not think it could.

Consequently, it is clear that we do have not only
conflict between the act and the negotiated plan but what can
safely be called a massive conflict.

Row anyone could call

that conflict peripheral contact, as the state calls it, I am
sorry, is beyond me.
Q

Anybody call anything anything, I suppose.

MR. HEATH:

This was my

point.

Q

Why is that stronger in the case of an agree­

I

would think what is being protected is the process.
MR. HEATH:
Rehr.quist.

Both are being protected, Mr. justice

Thera is not any questio^-, and the courts have

said and this Court has said, that the collective bargaining
process :1s protected.

Then we jump

a great cap and say that having been the case in the Disclosure

Q

Jure b&fors you get to that, I assume this-: is

fair.: inference from v;hat you said, but I just want to b© sure-..

42

It is your view, I take it, that if there were no Fair Labor
Standards Act, no minimum federal law, a. state would not hav?*
the power to fix a state minimum wage.
MR. HEATH;

That is right, Mr. Justice Stevens, and

I think that was held by this Court in 1914 in the Erie Ral Ix-oad
case.
Q

It is a matter of preemption.

MR. HEATH;

It is a matter of preemption.

all I am talking about, is preemption.
Q

That is

That is right,

Can a state have child labor laws?

MR. HEATH;

Probably only if authorized,as they are,

by the Wage and Hour Act,.

There you might get into the

question of whether rr not you fall into a health and safety
v ;.c pti ^

Bv.t except for that, no.
Q

what is the basis for the health and safety

©a;:.. - ptic • if it -lees not extend te soma other aspects of tra­
di tien.nl police power too?
MR. HEATH;

The basis for it was to have a vary

limited exception of the type which had been historically
racognized.
Q

Historically recognized where?

ME. HEATH;

Under the Railway Labor Act, for instance,

twooE rw, j «• ifsty laws.

And there have been for many years

tes—usually the industrial ccmrissior of fir ?fr,; a may
sot express provisions

i what safety devices must be used her©

43
and there on machines.

And that kind of law had been in effect.

I can only believe and assume that that is what was meant in
Oliver.

Actually this Court, in restating the local interest

exception as it did in Machinists, perhaps stated it so
tightly that it would be less broad than in Oliver.
Q

Dess Oliver seem crystal clear to you on reading

it?
MR. HEATH:

Q

The case, the decision?

The language.

MR. HEATH:

Yes, I think it is, Your Honor, for the

purposes for which I read it.
Q

3: suppose ® lot ©f people could

say that with

different clients from yours.
MR. HEATH:

Lot me cay this.

I have not talked about

it here, but the suggestion that Olivor has viability only
when you ere talking about the antitrust laws simply does not
by because the decisions which Oliver followed,
: ^ 1 "iiibb wore sot antitrust cosqs.

And when this

Covrfc in ?tacttnisfcn and earlier in Insurance Agents said it; is
perfectly clear chat we will not let a stata interfere with
a substantive solution of collective bargaining, they were not
talking about antitrust laws.

So, 1 do not think Oliver la

limited in that sense.
Q

Suppose it were clear that a state prospectively

could do what it is doing hare with respect to new collective

44
bargaining agreements, that its action would not b© preempted.

the limitation which the AFL-CIO have put on Oliver here?

Suppos® this Court were to'decide that prospec­

it did insofar as preemption and supremacy clause is concerned.
Would the issue be different with respect to past, contracts as

No.

As we have said in ©ur brief, I do not think there would be a
difference.

But arguably if you had a statute that was aj.rea.cly

in effect, you could bargain around it, if you please.

And

that that would be intolerable Interference because if you had

The National Labor Relations

This Court had articulated the principle
*

of labor law preemption clearly in Hansen and Taylor and tailed
cibout the imprimatur of federal law protecting contracts.

Aid

so th© day before the Disclosure Act there was not any sight
on the part of a state to change a collectiva bargaining
agreement, whether it is in pensions or otherwise.

They did

rot have that right then because if they had that right, labor
law preemption is gone again.

It is undermined because if the

day before the Pension Disclosure Act, if the stab© could have
sai/lj. f'Wis arc going to dictate th© terms of pension agreements,"
v-oy could say, "$tfe are going to insist, if you please, as a
minimum - hv. you give everybody 30 minutas of every hour off
so that our employees in cur state are veil rested, and we are
going to give everybody a minimum of five weeks vacation,* and

So, on its face w® think that the

Pension Disclosure Act does

power to them, and it did not have the power to act in this
way before the Pension Disclosure Act.
