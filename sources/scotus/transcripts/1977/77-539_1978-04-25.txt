MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK L. XRENSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. IKENSQN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case presents the question of whether the for­
giveness of a commodity tax on the exportation of certain
consumer electronic products from Japan is a bounty or grant
under our countervailing duty law.

Th© petitioner is a

domestic producer of such consumer electronic products as
television sets, radios and the like.
In 1970, petitioner filed a complaint with th©
Treasury Department, claiming that Japan conferred a bounty or
& grant upon th© exportation of like products by reason ©f th©
remission of a commodity tax on exportation.

In January of

1976, the Secretary of th© Treasury made a determination that
no bounty or grant was paid or bestowed on exportation.
Under a then recently enacted statute, th© petitioner
sought and obtained judicial review oyer the Secretary's
negative determination in th© United Spates Customs Court.
From the pleadings filed fay the parties in the court, it became
clear that the central facts were not in dispute.

Japan im­

poses a commodity tax on certain products when shipped from the

4
manufacturer’s factory for domestic consumption, that is con­
sumption in Japan? however, the same products when shipped for
export from Japan are exempt from payment of the commodity tax.
Each of the parties moved for summary judgment, the
petitioner arguing that, as a matter of law, the remission of
the tax on exportation constituted a bounty or grant? the
government arguing the contrarya

A three-judge panel of the

Customs Court agreed with the petitioner and awarded us sum­
mary judgment»

On appeal, the Court of Customs and Patent

Appeals reversed the 3-tO“2 decision and in February of this
year this Court granted certiorari6
W© say, Your Honors, that the tax commission clearly
is a bounty or grant on exportation and that offsetting duties
sailed countervailing duties should be assessed on imported
products from Japan which benefit from the tax remission.
The countervailing duty law as it now exists has
remained essentially unchanged since the first general counter­
vailing duty law was enacted as section 5 of the Tariff Act
of 1897»

Since that time, the law was reenacted five times,

and it was twice construed by this Court in the Downs case and
in the Nicholas case.

Both decisions made clear that the

statute’s coverage is extremely

broad and particularly with

respect to the remission of tax on exportation, that that
©vent is a bounty or grant.
In Downs, the first of the two countervailing duty

5

cases considered by this Court, the Court had before it a
very complex Russian program which sought to control the production, price and exportation of sugar.

The scheme was ex­

tremely complicated but it included two facts which this Court
considered most important®
Fact number one, all sugar sold domestically was
subject to an excise tax*

Fact number two, all sugar exported

from Russia was exported free of such tax®

The Court pro­

ceeded to state that whenever a tax is imposed upon all sugar
prod:aced but is remitted on all sugar exported, then by what­
ever process or in whatever manner or under whatever name it
is disguised, it is a bounty upon exportation®
Now, it is true, there was another aspect of the
Russian plan which the Court considered®

Exporters of sugar

received certificates which were marketable and valuable®

The

Court discussed whether or not these certificates also con­
stituted a bounty or grant, and the Court said that it did®
But that does not detract from the Court’s very forceful
language that the principal and the key facts in the entire
scheme were the two that I mentioned, to Your Honors, that all
sugar sold in the home market is taxed and that all sugar
Y

exported was sold free of tax*
This language of tHii" Court declaring that the re­
mission of tax under such circumstances is a bounty or grant
requiring th® imposition of countervailing duties is not or

6
was not unguarded language as the government would character­
ize it»

That language is consistent with repeated statements

of this Court# both in the Downs case and in cases subsequent
to and prior to Downs»

In the Nicholas case# the only other

countervailing duty case# this Court cited as an example of a
bounty or grant on exportation# the remission of a tax when
that tax is levied on products sold in the home market0
In an earlier case# in Passavant# the Court expressed
its recognition as to why governments remit taxes on exportafcicn.

The Court said doubtless to encourage exportation# to

encourage feh® introduction of domestic goods into export
markets# taxes are remitted on exportation.

Ther© was no

mystery about the benefits of tax remission on exportation®
The Court perceives the benefit and the Court deems such, a
benefit to ba a countervailabl® bounty or grant.
Notwithstanding the teachings of this Court# which
are quite clear# the Secretary of the Treasury has developed a
practice under tha countervailing duty law of excusing from
countervail remissions of indirect tax®

The practise unques­

tionably conflicts with decisions of this Court®
Now. as I said earlier# the Congress reenacted the
statute five times since 1897 and it reenacted it several
times after this Court8s Downs decision and after this Court's
Nicholas decision,
Of course# Congress reenacted the statute after tha

mental question ©rises»

A funda»

By reenactment of the statute after

this Court’s decision and after the administrative practice
of the Secretary, what did Congress have in mind.

Did Congress

intend to ratify the practice or did Congress intend to ratify
this Court’s decisions»
QUESTION;

The question is so ~«

Or neither

MR® IKENSON:

That is always a possibility, Your

Honor, except I think it is a rather well settled principle
that when Congress reenacts a statute after a judicial inter­
pretation of the statute becomes known to it, it is deemed to
have ratified that interpretation.
QUESTION;

Or is it possible that the problem was

regarded as so delicate and difficult that they would rather
have this Court decide it?
MR. IKENSON:

I think not.}:' Your Honor»

I think

clearly Congress —
QUESTION;

Well, your point is that this Court did

decide it in the Downs case, isn’t that right?
MRo IKENSON;

That’s correct»

Our point is this;

Congress was aware of the Downs case and certainly by th© time
of the last reenactment, th© Trade Act of 1974, it was aware
of the Nicholas case, it was aware ©f the administrative
practice.

How did Congress respond in th© Trad© Act of 1874?
Firstly, it opened th© courts to American

8
manufacturers by providing specially for judicial review over
negative countervailing duty determinations by the Secretary.
This enabled American manufacturers who were agrieved by the
non-assessment of countervailing duties on imports which were
benefited by tax remission on exports to com® to th® courts
and to invoke this Court's teachings of Downs and Nicholas.
The Congress went further.

Th© Congress ~ the key

committees of th® Congress discussed the administrative prac­
tice in the legislative history ©£ th® Trade Act and said that
we are neither approving nor disapproving of that practice.
They then left th© situation — they rather invited resolution
of th® question by th© courts by making judicial review avail­
able to American manufacturers by stating clearly that they
were not expressing approval or disapproval of th© administra­
tive practice.
QUESTIONS

Mr, Ikenson* can I ask you a factual ques­

tion about th© Downs case?

It is kind of a hard case to undar-

stand.
MR. XKEMSONs
QUESTIONS

¥©s? Your Honor»

Th© Solicitor General says that the

actual Countervailing duty that was assessed there was measured
by th© value of th© certificates rather than th© certificates
plus the questioned tax.
a matter of fact?

Do you agree with that analysis, as

I know you would draw a different inference*

but can we accept that as a. correct interpretation?

9
MR. IKENSON s

Wellf X must preface my response to

Your Honor by saying that the -value of the grant in the Downs
case was not before the Court.

It was the understanding of

the parties at th© time and of the courts below that the amount
of countervail was not judicially reviewable.

Th® sol® ques­

tion was whether or not the entire Russian scheme constituted
& conferral of a bounty or grant.

So whether or not the actual

amount o£ countervailing duty was correct was never put before
the Court.
Nowf to respond more directly to Your Honor’s ques­
tions

The amount of countervail put on by the Secretary of the

Treasury was equal to what th® Secretary determined to be th©
profit gained by th® Russian exporter by reason of the export
certificate,
equaled'

I wouldn’t say that th© amount of countervail

the value of the certificate.

It was based upon th©

Secretary’s determination of profit that was earned.
QUESTION:

I Si©8

MR. IKENSOMs

When th© Court discussed the certifi­

cate and indicated what value it felt th® certificate had* it
said clearly the value of the certificate is 1.25 rubies par
pood; which was a unit of weight; because that was the market

X
value, that was the amount of money that an exporter could
receive for his certificate.

The Court looked differently at

the value of th© certificate than th© Secretary of th©
Treasury

10
1 hop© I have not given yon any too long an answer,
Your Honor.
QUESTIONS

Ho.

I thank yon for it.

QUESTION:

Mr. Xkenson, what was the role of the

administrative practice in a ease such as this?'

Is there

latitude for the Secretary of the Treasury as the statute is
presently drawn to decide on© way or the othsr and be affirmed
by th© courts in either ease?
MR. IKENSONt
latitude at all.

W@ say, Your Honor, that there is no

The statute is mandatory, it is clear and

as understood by Congress th© amount of discretion given to
the Secrotary of the Treasury is very slight if ©sistent at
all.

The Secretary has discretion to determine th© amount of

a bounty or grant.

He does not have discretion to determine

what a bounty or grant is.
QUESTION:

Well, what you more accurately say in

.response to my Brother Relinquish’© question, if this amounts
to a bounty or grant, then he has nv discretion whatsoever?
MR. XKENSON:
QUESTION:

That’s true, Your Honor.

And you further say that as a matter of

law this is a bounty or grant.
SNs

MR. XKENSONs^xThat is true, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

But wouldn’t you allow for any situations

where the Secretary in a close case might decide something
was or was not, a bounty or grant and say that his determination

l

11
shenld be affirmed by the Customs Court in either event?

Or

do you say flatly no, it goes either one way or the other,
depending on how the Court decides?
MR. 1KENS0N %

1 would say that as a matter of law

a program is or Is not a bounty or grant.
QUESTIONs

Well, you don’t think you will win that

argument though, because it has already been decided, you say,
whether it is or isn’t,
MR. IKEWSONs

That’s correct.

My next point was,

Your Honor, that in this particular case, with this particular
type of program, the Court' has determined that as a matter of
law, a tS’
.x remission on export is a bounty or grant.
I would like to comment —
QUESTIONj

Even though in some other context some-

times a court has approved a decision of an administrator con­
struing a statute and two or three years later or ten years
later h® comes back with a different construction of the
statute and he gats affirmed here than, too.
MR. XKENSOHt

Yes, but that —» in those cases, the

administrator is given — is conferred a broad discretion in
administering the statute
QUESTIONt

Well, all ha has got is the words of the

statuta to interpret and enforce and he does it one my in one
decade and another way in another decade.
\
QUESTIONS Every eight years, as in the case of the

12
Labor Board.
MU. I KEN S OH;

Wall, in this particular statute,

Your Honor, the Secretary of the Treasury is not even named as
the parson who shall determine whether a bounty or grant is
bestowed.

Instead, the statute has read consistently whenever

a bounty or grant is bestowed, et cetera, then the Secretary
shall determine the amount ©£ bounty or grant and assess the
duty.
QUESTIONs

So as far as the statute reads, he has

no role in determining whether it is one way or another?
MR. IKENSON s
QUESTIONs

As a practical matter ~

But somebody has to have in this instance

MR. I KEN SON 8

That's correct, and I should say that.

this has already been discussed by a lower court in 1940.
The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals noted that the statute
does not even provide that the Secretary should make the
initial determination.

However, as a matter of custom and

common sense, it should be the Secretary to make this deter­
mination.
QUESTIONS

Mr. I ken son, do we know her© exactly what

MR. IKENSONt

We do not know, Your Honor,

The

Secretary did not offer any explanation as to his reason for
not countervailing.

However, we do not claim that that is an

error in this case because we view the role of the Customs

13
Court as being a court that affords trial de novo and we are
not reviewing a decision of an administrative agency — we
are not reviewing it under the general terms of review?
general standards of review where we look to an administrative
record or the standards of arbitrariness and capriciousness
and the like.

We had a trial de novo available to us in the

Customs Court and under those circumstances we do not feel
that it was

error for the Secretary not to have elaborated

on Me reasons for his negativa determination.
I would like to comment briefly on a point made by
the Chief Justice regarding the Congress3 awareness of the
sensitivity of this problem,

There is no question that

Congress appreciates that the application of countervailing
duties is a very delicate issue? that fch© application of
countervailing duties by the United States unilaterally cer­
tainly can causa international friction.

Congress was aware

of this when it enacted the Trade Act? and it devised a
master plan to deal with countervailing duties.
On the one hand? it was concerned about promoting
international harmony and international trad©.

On the other

hand? it was concerned about permitting domestic industry to
\

stand by and suffer because it had to compete with unfair
competition with bounty-fed or subsidised competition»
Congress struck a very delicate balance.

So

It directed the

»©gotiat© an agreement on the

u
application of countervailing duties.
On the other hand, it directed tlm Secretary of the
Treasury to enforce the countervailing duty law by putting
time limits on him in handling countervailing duty petitions.
It also provided for judicial review of negative determina­
tions.
Congress had to do more to prevent American manufac­
turers' suits from upsetting the international applecart.

So

what Congress did was to give limited discretion to the
Secretary of the Treasury to postpone the assessment of
countervailing duties in cases where bounties or grants were
bestowed.

This is the way that international friction could

We eay that those consequences need not occur and#
furthermore# Congress was

aware of the danger of such conse­

quences it provided for it and any consideration of them by

It is

ORAL ARGUMENT OF '/JADE H. HicCREE, JR. 9 ESQ.',
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. McCREB 3

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
The question presented in this appeal is whether
the remission of the Japanese commodity tax which is imposed
on certain consumer electronics products only if they ar© sold
in Japan is a bounty or grant within the meaning of the Tariff
Act of ,1930.
When the Congrgas required the imposition of a
countervailing duty in addition to any duties otherwise im­
posed whenever a bounty or grant was paid or bestowed upon
the manufacture

or production or export of an article im­

ported into the United States, it did not

define the words

0bounty" or 15grant,0 and it then tm cam® the duty of the
Secretary of the Treasury not only to compute the net amount
of a countervailing duty that might be due, but also and
initially to determino whether the triggering event the grant
or bounty had occurred.
Sine© a variety of governmental activities could
properly b© regarded as bestowing a bounty or grant, for

19.
©scamp].a , a favorable property tax rate or perhaps exemption
from a property tax altogetherf the Secretary required some
guidance in defining these words.
As wa have set forth on pages 19 through 24 of our
brief; the Secretary was not without direction from the
Congress.

In the evolution of the statutory language and in

the explanations of the congressional debates, it became
evident that Congress did not regard the non-excessive re­
mission of an excise tax as a bounty or grant; and w® define
non-excessiv© remission to moan a. forgiveness of the tax* not
in excess of what was actually paid.
In that portion of our brief we point out that as
warly as 1890; in the sugar tariff; we find the earliest use
of the word "bounty* in the context of the encouragement of
exports.

Th© record on debate indicates what Congress under-

stood then by its use of bounty; and. this was th© remission or
drawback of indirect taxee exceeding the taxes the exporters
had paid on the goods.
By leave of Court ; I would like to us© on® sentence
from the remarks of Senator Gibson in th® congressional debate
on that act; and this is found at page 21 of the government's
brief.

And Senator Gibson; after giving an example; saids

"But upon the export of & ton of sugar; he received back as a
drawback §1X7.@0; making a clear bounty of $20.54 per gross
ton of sugar imported."

This follows a statement that only

$97,06 per gross ton was paid.
So it is clear from that example that it was the
$20,34 excess over the tan paid by th© exporter that was re­
garded as a bounty.
QUESTION!

Mr. Solicitor General, don't you think

that the words ?directly or indirectly" in th© statute that we
are presently dealing with might expand that view of the word
"bounty"?
MR. MdCREEs

They might b© so regarded, except in

1890f in th© first Sugar Act, the language was used,directly
or indirectly was employed at the time Senator Gibson gave us
this example, which would indicate that it was understood then
just to indicata th© excessive remission.

It wasn't added

subsequently.
On page 20 of our brief, we set forth about half-way
down the page the language of the IS90 statute, and the
second or third line from the bottom of th© quoted language,
we show that directly or indirectly was found initially when
bounty was first employed.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Solicitor General, does the word

"drawback" have"-»- is' that a term of art?

It is tmf ami liar to

me.
MR. McCREEi

It was my firat acquaintance with it,

too, if th© Court please, and it is used as I understand it
synonymously with — it means
.V

...

a payback, va remission may be
-

- -•

.•

*

. '

an exemption frees the tax? a drawback is a return ©f the
amount paid, and it has been used consistently to mean a nonexcessive drawback unless it indicates otherwise.
After that first Sugar Tariff Act in 1890, in 1894,
as wa point out on pages 21 and 22 of cur brief, a proviso
was added to the sugar tariff that makes clear that a nonexeessiv© remission does not require a countervailing duty.
That proviso is found at the bottom of page 21, and it pro­
vides that ths importer of sugar produced in a foreign country
the government of which grants such direct or indirect bounties
may be relieved from this additional duty which was a counter­
vailing duty in case said importer produces a certificate of
said government that no indirect bounty has been received
upon such sugar in excess of the tax collected upon the beet
or cane from which it was produced.
Thera again we have the guidance that the Secretary
found in the early statutory history of countervailing duties»
Finally, in this brief excursion into the statutory history,
in 1897 \m find that the statute was revised and made applic­
able to all imported products and not just sugar, and there
the proviso was deleted but we find the addition of language
which we believe for the reasons 1 will state to ba a sub­
stitute for the proviso.

That language is that there shall

be levied and paid an additional duty equal to the net amount
of such bounty or grant.

W© believe that the use of not

amount means the mount in excess of the tax otherwise paid*
and this would appear to ba the intention from the floor
debate that wa set forth on page 22 and 23 of our brief.
And if this legislative history than is proper
guidance, the Secretary has indeed followed it eonsistoutly
in his application and interpretation of the statute for
eighty years, during which time, as my brother pointed out,
the Congress has reenacted this statute in almost the identi­
cal language.
We point out in Footnote IS on page 24 that the
Congress had explicit notification in 1949 of the Secretary's
construction and application of the statute, and nonetheless
reenacted the statute knowing that hs did not apply it to the
non-axcessive remission of an excise tax.
Also, and perhaps even more pertinently, in .1973,
when the Senith petition was pending before the Secretary, a
witness requested an amendment to require the countervailing
nan-*excessive remission and that amendment was. rejected and
the Congress, of course, was aware not only of the practice
that is attacked hero but also of its application indeed to
the litigant before us.
QUESTIONs

General McCree, do you agree with your

opponent as to the allocation of function between the
Secretary, the Customs Court and the CCPA that he stated
yesterday?

23
MR* MeCREEs

Well, the Secretary has by regulation

imposed on the Collector of Customs this or has delegated to
him the duty placed upon the Secretary of the Treasury and
the Collector of Customs Hakes the determination which can
be challenged in the Customs Court and in the Court ©f
Customs Appeal*
QUESTION?

What standard does the Customs Court us©

in determining whether or not the Secretary properly deter­
mined that something was a direct or indirect bounty?
/

MR. McCREE*

W© submit that the Customs Court deter­

minas whether the Secretary or his delegate has mad® a reason­
able interpretation of the statute.

We believe that this is

a statute very much like other statutes that are entrusted or
til© administration of which is entrusted to an administrator,
either an agency or a Cabinet officer, and that he has the
right, indeed fch® duty to make classifications to implement
its application, and wa submit that the proper judicial review
is whether the classification is reasonable to carry out the
purposes of the statute.
QUESTION?

Mr. Solicitor General, 1 thought yester­

day that your opposition said that the Customs Court regarded
this as da novo,
MR. MoCREEs
QUESTION s
MR. McCREE%

If the Court pleas© —
I3o you agree with that?
1 heard him say that, and I disagree

24
with him.

1 don't think the Customs Court docides itself

whether this is a bounty or grant.

I think it decides whether

the Secretary5 a determination is a reasonable one,
QUESTION 8

Then my next question is th© one I would

have asked him if it was answered the other way, how do w®
know from this record the standards the Secretary employed
here?
MR. MCCREE3

W© know because we have eighty years of

consistent interpretation, unvarying from th© holding made
here today that the ~ or made in this ease that the nan*»
excessive remission is not a grant or bounty.
QUESTION?
didn't say that much.

Well, certainly in this case the Secretary
He sat on it for years and then came

up dry, is what it about amounted to,
MR. McCREE3

If the Court please, that is correct,

and we would agree that a detailed reason would have to be
given if the Secretary was considering something that had not.
been considered by him before* But here, ever since, as' our
brief on page 10 2 think, not© five, points out, since 1898,
in the first synopsis of d@cis.ion 696 has made 'this same
construction.

And after having done that since 1898, which

if memory serves is the year of the Spanish War, unvaryingly
he has so interpreted and applied the statute.
So wa suggest that under those circumstances perhaps
h© used not give th© kind of detailed reasoning that would be

25
necessary otherwise for appropriate judicial review of Ms
action.
QUESTION s

I guess all I am saying is I would feel

a little snore comfortable had he spelled out his reasons
where we have judicial review.
MR. McCREE?

If the Court pleas®, I share the

Court's concern for responsible administrative action, and I
think that is something that administrators should do.

But

I suggest that when this is a consistent application, perhaps
hare we need not ba as concerned as w© might b® otherwise if
it were a new application®
I -would lik® to suggest that not only has the
Secretary consistently made this interpretation, but also the
international trading community understands this to ba the
V

construction of our statute.■

indeed in the General Agree­

ment on Tariffs and Tirade, an acronym pronounced GATT, the
agreement which we have entered into through the Executive
Branch of the government, because the Congress has not,
specifically sets forth that the nonfexcessive remission of
a consumption tax, an excise tax, that this Japanese commodity
w.

tax, as my brother would agree is, is not the grant of a

vailing duties, which all of the subscribers to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trad© employ in one way or anofchar.
And so we suggest that here we have eight years of

26
uninterrupted, unvarying construction of the statute, of the
original statute, with congressional reenactment five times,
with awareness not only of the practice but also of the
specific application to Zenith, the petitioner in this case.
And we suggest that the classification that fch© administrator
has adopted is reasonable under all the circumstances, so
that even if this ease fell outside of it, it would still be
appropriate, as this Court has recognised, if a classifica­
tion is reasonable, alttough we don’t have to argue that be­
cause was believe that this case is well inside of it.

MR. McCREE:

If the Court pleas©, we do make that

concession,yes, and that is correct as we understand it.
We would also like to observe that, as my brother
ha© argued and as the dissent in the Court of Customs and
Patent Appeals urges, this is not inconsistent with any of the
decisions of this Court.

As Mr. Justice Stevens’ inquiry

yesterday afternoon brought out, in the Downs case, which my
brother urges is a governing precedent and would require this
Court to rule to the contrary, we did not have an excessive
remission of mi excise tax simpliciter.

We had there instead

the remission ©f & tax mid the bestowing of a certificate,

colloquy between the Court and my brother developed and demon­

either the value of that certificate or a profit derived frcaa
the ©zeroise of that certificate and was not in th© amount of
the excise tax that was remitted.

QUESTIONS

Mr. Solicitor General, you must have to

concedo, I should suspect, that the language in th® Downs eas®
is squarely against your position?
MR. McCREEi

If th® Court please, we do concede that

there is that language in Downs that is against us, and this
Court has cautioned us and other counsel that appear her® many

28
times of the hasard of taking language out of contest of an
opinion and urging it as controlling in another situation,
QUESTION g

How how is this out of contest of the

opinion?
MR. McCBEEs

Well, if the Court please, 1 wish I

could answer that simply, and I will give you the best answer
1 can, because I find the Downs opinion one of the most con­
fusing opinions I have tried to parse ia a number of years,
QUESTIONS

St has a lot of complications,

(Laughter}
MR. McCREE s

I would like to think that it '«as alone

in this classification, but I have to agree that it is not.
But Downs: concerns a very comp lav. system of controlling sugar
prices within Csarist Russia, and apparently every producer
had to place his sugar into three categories — so-called free
sugar, other sugar that could be transferred into free sugar
under certain circumstances, and -then surplus sugar*

And there

was one level of tax on the free sugar, there was an excise
tax that could be levied for domestic consumption, this could
— there was a double tax on the surplus sugar.

The sugar in

the middle apparently was subject to manipulation by a
bureaucracy that oversaw this entire scheme.
To sell the surplus sugar at the double tax was pro­
hibitive, ee nobody would want to do that.

But apparently some

of these persons would like to export that, and if they export

29
that sugar, then the tax would ba remitted and it could go
abroad*

Now? it was not just the remission of this tax that

occurred when it was exported, but also a cartioieat® was
given, © thing of value that permitted a person then to trans­
fer from his surplus sugar to his £re© sugar,
QUESTION?
MR. MeCREE?

1'n the domestic market?
In the domestic market, an equivalent

amount.
QUESTION s
MR* MeCREE s

Right.
And it was not the remission of the tax

that was countervailed there, but it was an amount equivalent
either to the value of the certificate or computed in some way
on the value of the certificate* and it is for tills reason
that I respond to the Court that that language is taken utterly
out of context,
QUESTIONs

Well, out of context perhaps of the facts

of th© case, but not really out of context of "the opinion in
the case.

And as we w©r© told yesterday by your brother, it

was understood at that time and by that Court, as he tells us,
/

that the amount of the -tax was not a reviewafole matter and was
not there an issue* the amount therefore of the grant or
bounty,
MR* MeCREEs

Well, it appears; that th© parties con­

ceded that they were discussing

conceded tha amount that

they ware discussing, and I submit that if th© Court — that if

30
a court <3 a eidas -- if a court uses language not necessary to
the decision of & case, that that language isn’t controlling»
because a case decides a controversy, and this Court doesn’t
issue advisory opinions.

And if this language is to ©over a

situation not before the Court, it shouldn't be deemed by
anyone who reads it or this Court to bind the Court in
another situation.
QUESTIONs

It purports to be» this statement, under

the summary of the test.
MR. McCREEs

It purports to be that and in this

respect it is confusing.
QUESTION3

It is not casual inadvertent language, is

It is quite positive and repetitive even.
MR. MeCIiEE 3

in error but ha was not — th© author was not in any doubt
about this.
[Laughter]
MR. McCREE;

X would adopt that and wish that 2 had

The trouble is, it wasn’t only the author,

MR. McCREEs
QUESTI ©I s

That is exactly so.
General McCree, by your version, the

31
whole Miranda opinion is dicta? foaeausa it addressed a number
of subjects that weren't before the Court at all.
[Laughter]
MR. MeCREEs

By leave of the Court, I am having

enough difficulty with, this problem and I would like to make
no comment.
[Laughter]
QUESTIONS

I think Miranda has had a lot of difficulty

without being involved in it.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Solicitor General, the fact that the

Court has used dicta in other casos doesn't mean -this wasn't
dicta.
MR. MeCREEs

That's correct.

And I would suggest,

too, that since Downs, the Secretary has consistently counter­
vailed only excessive remissions, and th© Congress lias been
aware of it and the Congress must be presumed to be aware of
Dorns, including this language.
QUESTION:

Would it ha fair to say that th© Secretary

has consistently ignored the language of Downs?
MR. MeCREEs

Well, I would prefer to say that the

Secretary has consistently r@cogn.ised what Dorns really held,
despite the language, and has consistently followed that prac­
tice and with congressional concurrence — and here we are
concerned with a matter that is entirely within th© province
of th© Congress e tfa© Congress has established ths countervailing

32
tax and the Congress can take this away, end I believe our
job here is to decide what has the Congress decided to do.

had whoa the Congress has specifically declined to require
the countervailing of a non-excessive remission in the ease
of this very litigant# it would appear that the Secretary is
indeed following the Congress9 direction.
QUESTId? s

Mr, Solicitor General» could 1 ask a

question which perhaps X shouldn't ask.

It may bo a little

delicate# but at the request of the Department of State you
distributed a communication from tha government of Japan in
this matter# and let me read from on© portion of thats

“The

government of Japan fully understands that the government of
the United States is acting in good-faith»*8 and so forth.
"In the unlikely event that the United States should proceed
in a manner violative of the very international rules in the
establishment of which it lias taken leadership • to further the
objective of freer international trad©# those countries who
join with the United States in establishing such rules to
promote economic development through normalisation of inter­
national trade might be compelled to question the good-faith

What does that moan vis-a-vis this case?

Court?
MR. McCHEE*

X do not and X certainly circulated it

only because it had boon forwarded to us frees the Department

We don’t

suggest that this Court should ba responsive either to any
threat off any apprehension of apocralyptie consequences in
the field of international trad®.

This Court's task as we see

it is to decido what did the Congress mean by these words

th© legislative history that w@ have written about in our
brief and discussed this morning and as illustrated by the
consistent practice of the Secretary over eighty years and
as illustrated by th® understanding of the international
trading community.

And w© think that this Court„ of course,

would aspect the Congress to respond in any way it deemed fit
if the Congress did not agros with the statute as this Court
will ultimately construe it.

But this Court has the absolute

power to construe this as it sees it in its judicial, its
informed judicial judgment.
QUESTIONS

In any event, you are hare in good-faith

doing your best to uphold the position espoused by the govern­

Well, if the Court please, I regard my

role here as seeking to uphold tha construction that th©

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK L. IKESSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETIT! QNBR““REBUTTAL
MR. IKENSON%

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

the Courts
I would first-like to address myself to a question
posed by Mr. Justice White regarding the role of the Collaetor
of Customs and the Secretary.
The statute has consistently given authority to th©
Secretary to determine th© amount of countervailing duty to be
assessed.

The Secretary delegates functions to Collectors of

Customs throughout the United States to assess countervailing
duties to offsat particular grants.
In the Downs case, the Secretary of the Treasury made

38
a determination that th© Russian program conferred a bounty
or grant and then issued instructions throughout th® United
Statos to Collectors of Customs.

Th® Downs case arose in

Baltimore, where th© collector there imposed a countervailing
duty in an amount equal to that contained in the instructions
from the Secretary of th® Treasury, and that was protested by
the importer who <dien litigated th® subject.
QUESTION 2

And did this Court «agree with the

Secretary/ it upheld the Secretary?
MR.» iXEKTSONs
QUESTIONt

That is not correct, Your Honor.

Isn*t it?

MR. IKENSONs

What did they say?

Well, at the very outsat of the case,

the amount of countervailing duty was not put in issue for
the reasons that I gave yesterday.

The amount of countervail

is not deemed to be judicially reviewable.

The question

framed by the part’d.©® was whether the Russian program con­
ferred' 'a bounty ox* grant.

The courts below, the Board of

General Appraisers and then th® Fourth Circuit determined that,

MR. XKENSOS? 3

I am just speaking personally.

YesYour Honor.

I would like vary

much to turn back to Downs and the issue as put to the Court.
Downs argued after the Board of General Appraiser© decided
against them and after the Fourth Circuit decided against
them, ha argued before this Court that the lower courts were
wrong.

He argued that the lower courts found that the

Russian scheme conferred two bounties, a bounty by' reason of
the tax remission, a bounty by reason of the conferring of
the certificate.

Downs made it clear to the Court that this

was his understanding of the lower courts had said, and then
Downs argued in his brief that the courts below were wrong on
both issues.

Downs argued that the certificate did not'con­

stitute. a bounty.

Downs also argued that the remission of

tar did not constitute a bounty.
this Court.

This was squarely put before

Xt was briefed by Downs.

Downs headed a section

^3
of his brief with the following language

''The remission of

excise taxes on the exportation of sugar is not a bounty or
grant on exportation as the terras are used in section 5."
The government joined issue with Downs on both
points*

The government said that both the remission of the

tax could b® a bounty and both the certificate could be a
bounty.

The Court then decided the issues presented to it,.
I would like to turn to soma other remarks mad© by

my distinguished adversary.

E© indicated that in 1949,

Congress received explicit notice of Treasury's 'practice and
didn't amend it.

However, that is not the entire story,, ba»

cause in that period of time, 1949 and 1950, when the Executive
Branch brought Treasury's practice to th© attention of Congress,
it asked Congress to amend the law because there is a potential
conflict between Treasury's practice and judicial interpretations.

Congress refused to amend the law.

Did it get out of committee?

HR. I&BHSGM s

It got out of committee in 1950, it

passed the House and then it died.

The following year it was

introduced, it did not get out of the Senate Finance Committee.
QUESTION s

Are those committee reports instructive

or not?
MR* IXBKSOSfs

The reports indicate that Congress was

concerned about another feature of the bill which would have
provided for an injury requirement which was not present in
the countervailing duty statute.

However, the -testimony at

the committe® hearings ar© instructive in that —
QOESTXOSw:

What about the report, what did it say

about countervailing duties?
MR. IKEK'SON: • Thar® was no mention of the — the
second time, Your Honor, the bill did not get reported and
in trying to understand the reason why the bill was not re­
ported out, we can look to the hearings and we find that there

flict between the Treasury*s practice and the Judiciary's in­
terpretation wan not satisfactory.

to 'change the statute?
QUESTIONS

They were satisfied with what the

Secretary was doing, notwithstanding this explicit language
in Downs.
MR. IKENSON a

I think not, Mr. Chief Justice.

I

think if Congress is told there is a potential conflict between a judicial interpretation and an administrative practice,
and Congress doss nothing, if any tiling is to be inferred, it
should be that Congress was satisfied with the judicial inter­
pretation

46
QUESTIONc

Or satisfied with the conflict.

MR. IKEMSGSKt

Well,- that is something 2 did not con­

sider, Your Honor.

In 1973, ths Solicitor General advised that a witness
told the Congress that — suggested to the Congress that the
law be changed to clearly provida that the remission of in­
direct tar on exportation be deemed a bounty or grant, and
Congress did nothing to — did. not adopt the suggestion.

I

don’t think any great weight can fo® given to this turn of
events because Congress in 1973 and 974 clearly wanted to pave
the way for smooth negotiations and for an international agree­
ment.

It did not wish to begin at that time to isolate

specific bounty practices and instruct the Secretary of the
Treasury that fee must immediately begin countervailing.

In­

stead, Congress did devise.* this very complex scheme which I
described to Your Honors yesterday.

I thin]? that was

Congress® way of dealing with the problem.

It wanted an

international agreement, it did not want to foe selective,.
Thank you, Your Honors.
ME. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Thank you, gentlemen. The

case is submitted.
