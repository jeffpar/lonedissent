MR,, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

s

We will hear arguments

Mr* LravensoKi, you may proceed when you are ready»
OPAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL D. LEVENSCN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LEVENSONs

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
This «esa focuses on & section of tit® Internal
Ravsnue Cod® dealing with personal holding corapsnl®s and
corporations which unnecessarily accumulate ir.ceme.

These

special provisions have been placed in the Code to deal with
the shareholders of those companies who wish to accumulate
income in a corporation.

Such accumulation would thereby

shield the corporate profits from the second tax at ‘the high
tax rates imposed upon the recipients of dividends.
Until 1921, Congress davit with these shareholders
directly by taxing them on their pro rata share af corporat®
earnings t regardless of whether or not those earnings were
distributed to them.

However, after this Court’s decision in

ID 21 in the case of Eisner v. Rsccmherdoubts arose as to
the constitutionality of such

direct taxing scheme.

Congress provided an alternative method.

Therefore >

It allowed the

shareholders to determine if trty wished to account for th©
corporate profits in their incomes directly, whether or not

4
distributedj but failing that. Congress created an -Incentive
to encourage corporations which had been determined to ba
unnecessarily accumulating their income to actually make

,

distributions of the unneeded incom® to their shareholders
which would then be taxed at the individual rate.

Congress did this by imposing what it thought to be
a virtually confiscatory tax on the undistributed income of
these corporations and then by providing a deduction for
dividends distributed to shareholders which directly reduces
the income subject to the additional tax.

It is this

dividends-paid deduction which is at issue in this case.
Specifically tha question involves tho determination
of the araount of the deduction whs?-

a

corporation distributes

a dividend consisting of property rath-a? than cash.

Tha

government maintains} that tha fair market value of the property
at the date of distribution should be totally disregarded
even though the shareholder who receives the property is taxed
in full on that value.

The government has done this by

promulgating Treasury Regulation 1*562-1(a), the regulation
involved in this? case, which regulation states that when
property is distributed by

a

corporation, the dividends-paid

deduction shall equal the property's adjusted basis, not its
fair market vain©,

,

We maintain that thin regulation

as. it pc stains to

this case, is inconsistent v-jit-i the Xsvkerac.l Revr-n^e Code „■ is

5

arbitrary, totally without statutory or legislatives support,
and leads to irrational results.

For those reasons we submit

that the regulation should be declared to foe invalid,
Q

Do you know when this regulation was promulgated,

Mr» Levensen?
MR. L2VENS0N:

In 1258, «1© final regulation year.

The basic thrust of both the personal holding com­
pany and accumulated earnings taxes has always been the same,
to fore® distributions from the business to be taxed, again in
the hands of the shareholders.
Q

But -this rule has always been the same too,

has it not?
MR, LEVSNSOMs
Q

No, it has not. Your Henor.

1 thought the rule before the '54 Cede was the

same,
MR, LEVENSONs

The rul® prior to the 1954 Coda was

to allow a deduction for the lesser of the adjusted basis or
the fair market value of the property distributed.
Q
MR.

So, it would work the same in this case?
levensoh:

In this particular case the regula­

tion—
Q

The rul© was the same before the *54 Code as

it is now,
MR. mraNSOilx
Q

Y'8f, but r,at la general,

Pr®-'54, you had to take the worst, ths worst of

6

the two deals, the taxpayer.

Post-'54, according to the

government, you talc© the adjusted basis whether it is higher
or lower than the fair market value.
MR. LEVENSON:

Yes, Your Honor, and that is what we

will elaborata on further in our argument, that in fact the
government's rule does not creat® mors tax, does not create
more equity, but in fact we will demonstrate that it creates a
loophole through which corporations and shareholders who are
the ammzs of those corporations with highly depreciated
property can crest® a tax loss—
Q

And therefore you should have a greater

deduction in this case?
MR, LEVENSONi
for our argument.

No, Your Honor, that is not the basis

Our argument will be based upon the meaning

of the Cod© as we have divined it from the committee reports,
not having to do with the

equity or the inequity of any

particular rule.
Q

In view of what you say, why do you suppose the

government is taking the position that it is in this case?
MR. LEVENSON:

via

have -thought long and hard on that,

Your Honor, end wo think without any way to or ov a its
correctness that the government regulation writing, the
Treasury in IS*56 when these regulations were proposed, saw the
typographical error ir- the committee reports dealing with
Section 562.

That typographical error has been referred te in

7
our briefs and in particular in the opinion of the District
Court, judge in this case.

The typographical error refers in

the Senate report to Section 312,

That was the original

section in the House bill that dealt with, quote, "definition
of a dividend."

When the. Senate did its work on the Code, it

changed the numbering, changing the numbering of that particu­
lar section dealing with the dividend from 312 to 316.
Somehow the reference to 312—
Q

. Remained.

MR. LSVENSON:

-—remained in the report.

What we

have also dona is to track down the actual Senato amendments
which can be found in the Congressional Record, the technical
wording of the amendment which said, regarding Section 562,Chang® all references 31? •ho 312.*
So, to answer your question specifically, I do not
know the reason.

1 can only guess that someone was confused

by the Section 33.2 reference, saw the provisions of Section
312, whi /i talks about the reduction of earning® and profits

only by adjusted basis, and wrote the regulation accordingly.
Q

The 312 should be read as 316, should it not?

MR. LSVENSON:

In the committe® reports it. should be

road as 316, xm maintain, y&s.
To relieve tho corporation of a penalty t?.:z

by

providing a dividends -paid deduction to the same estsat that a
shareholder receives taxeibl® income is not anly symmetrical

8

but also accurately reflects the basic statutory purposes of
these laws and the specific statutory relationships of the
1954 Code.

If the deduction is greater than the amount taxed

to the shareholder, then there would be no incentive to dis­
tribute the full amount intended to be distributed by Congress.
A deduction for leas than the amount taxed to the shareholder
would require corporations to distribute property with a
value in excess of the amount subject to tax.

W® submit that

neither result is consistent with congressional purpose.
It is clear from the legislative history of the
1954 Cods that Congress envisioned a coherent,, integrated
system of corporate shareholder taxation.

As part cf this

scheme, it defined the definition cf the term "dividend" to be
a very precise term of art.

It might be useful to think of a

dividend as a molecule having several atomic components, each
of which is absolutely necessary to the character of the final
product.
First, there has to be a distribution.

That distri­

bution must be a distribution covered by Section 301 of the
Code.

Then that distribution must be of property, as that

term is defined in Section 317’a) of the Code.

The amount of

the distribution must be determined as set forth in Section
301(b).
Finally, the corporation must have earnings and
profits calculated, as indicated'.* i.

Section 312.

9
q

Mr. L@venson, on that point, supposing the

corporation has earnings arid profits that exceed the adjusted
basis of the dividend but are not as great as the market value
of the dividend, would the. dividend then be permissible under
your theory?
MR. LEVENSON:

X£ the earnings and profits exceed -She

fair market value—
Q

Nof the other way around.

The fair market value

exceeds the earnings and profits, but the earnings and profits
exceed tha adjusted basis.
MR. LEVENSON:

Then that portion of the appreciation

in the. property rising from the adjusted basis level to the
earnings and profits level, that amount will be taxable as a
dividend.

To the extent that there is an excess of apprecia­

tion—
Q

You say taxable as a dividend—

MR. LEVENSON:
Q

To the shareholders.

Under your theory, the market value is taxable

in either event >
MR. LEVENSON;

Only to the extent of earnings end

profits, Your Honor.
Q

I sea.

MR. LEVENSON:

This point in fact is; recognized by

the government in its regulations under Sections 316 and 312,
which arcs footnoted on page 4 of our reply brief, and from those

10

regulations you can se© the Interrelationship of these various
terms in both of those two Code sections.

And you will see how

the relationship of earnings and profits, fair market value,
and adjusted basis relate to each other in determining the tax
consequences to the shareholder.
Q

Let me change my example.

Assume the earnings

and profits are sufficient to exceed the market value.

What

kind of accounting adjustment doss the corporation make on its
books to keep the assets and liabilities equal when it
distributes more than the book value?
MR. L8VENS0N:
Q

Yes.

MR. LEVEMSONs
Q

If the earnings end profits axcaed—

-"the market value?

Correct.

MR. LEVENSOHs

Then the earnings and profits account

would b® ad ju sted only for the adjusted basis of the property
distributed.
0

What happens on the corporate books to the

difforesee between the adjusted basis and the market value,
under your view?
MR. LEVEKSON:

There would b© no adjustment on the

acccar&ting records of the corporation because the appreciation
in the property was never reflected, on the balance sheet of
fcha corporation.
Q

But. they give

deduction, as I understand you,

11
for feli® full market value of the asset.
MR. LEVENSON:

Only to the extent of the earnings

snd profits.
Q

Yes, but I 2® assuming the earnings and profits

are greater.
MR. LEVENSON:

That is correct; they get a deduction

for this special tax.
Q

It seems to m® that your asset and liability

ratio may change by fch® difference between adjusted basis and
market value.
MR. LEVENSON:

For the purpose of the normal

taxation of the corporation and the calculation of its
earnings and profits account, the resv.lt would be as I indica­
ted.

Only the adjusted basis of ths property would be
t

reflected as a diminishmant. of the earnings and profits.

For

this special tax, which has nothing to do with the normal
corporate accounting—that is, the balance sheet that you
might read at the ©nd of the year--it has no effect.
Q

So, there would have to fcs really a difference

S.n tax accounting and in normal accounting to carry cut your
theory.
MR. LEVENSON:

For the purpose of this special tax,

there certainly would be.

Our point is that if it is not a distribution covered
by Section 301, it caunot be r dividend.

If there are not any

12
earnings and profits, it. cannot be a dividend,

if the

distribution is net of property, it cannot be a dividend.
Every requirement has to b© met.

Each of the component

sections can only be understood by reference to the others.
It was this unitary, integrated concept that Congress referred
to in Section 562 when it stated that for the purpose of the
dividends-paid deduction, the rules of Section 316 encompassing
all of these concepts that go to snake up a dividend , that
the rules of Section 316 would be used to determine what is a
dividend specifically for the purposes* of defining what would
foe included as a dividends-paid deduction.
This scheme of statutory interrelationships is made
even clearer by reference to the statutory history of 315 in
the .1954 Cede, which is discussed in Part Two of our main
brief.

The government has not yet replied to the arguments

contained in Section Two or: our brief.

Possibly we will hear

.it on reply.
Alro, as I mentioned before, the regulations
promulgated under Sections 316 and 312 fur-char indicate the
integrated nature of these Code sections.

There is no reason

indicated in the Internal Revenue Code or in the committee
reports why the valuation of a dividend for the purposes of

th-3 personal holding company or accumulated earnings taxes
should be differant from the normal rules applicabis to
corporate distribution.

13
Quite to the contrary, .instead of enunciating a
separate rule, as under the Internal 'Revenue Code ©f 1939,
Section 562 refers to Section 316 as stating the basic
criterion of whether or not a distribution qualifies for the
dividends-paid deduction.
The adjusted basis rule, which is the rule urged by
the government in its Treasury regulation, is completely
irrational.

The fact of th® matter is that, the adjusted basis

for property bears no consistent relation to a corporation's
earnings, or realized investment Income.

Not all assets owned

by the corporation are owned by the corporation.
be acquired by contribution to capital.

Assets may

They may be acquired

by tax-free reorganization or in a myriad of other ways.
For example, the basis is often reduced each year
of depreciable property by that bookkeeping adjustment which
we know as depreciation.'

The rate and method of depreciation,

however, can often be elected by the taxpayer within certain
parameters set jut by the Internal Revenue Code.
Q

Is there any way of escaping this kind of

artificiality in this sort, of process?
MR. L3VEMS0Ni

We suggest, Your Honor

that the way

to escape the artificiality of this process is t . allow a
dividends-paid deduction for the value of the property which
in fact is distributed, whether that property is marketable,
whether that, proper fey is not marketable.

14
Q

But the taxpayer may properly and lawfully take

steps and take decisions which will minimize or even avoid a
t.ax liability, may he not?
MR. LEVEMSON:

of course he may.

We are suggesting

that h® be given the opportunity to determine which property
to distribute from a corporation, based upon only the criterion
that th® property have the value necessary to carry out the
equivalent of the corporation’s improperly accumulated income
be it. a personal holding company or a corporation subject to
th© accumulated warnings tax.
W-3 say that property with the same market value
but with vastly different, adjusted bases can be distributed by
two different corporations.

The tax impact on the corporation

should not be dissimilar when th«j tax impact on the share­
holders is th© same.
As I mentioned earlier in cur argument, the govern­
ment’s rule creates a significant—
Q

Mr. Levettson, on that kind of fundamental

proposition, why is that res?

In the normal case the tax

impact of a dividend is zero with respect to the corporation
but it creatas a tux obligation on behalf of the party
receiving th® dividend.

Why 1b there this need for this

similarity that is kind of crucial to your case?
MR. LWENSON;
tax, Your Honor,

Because of th© natura of tic special

Th©. tax, as w© have indicated, was enacted

15
first in fch© 1913 Revenue Act and consistently thereafter to
force corporations to distribute out income to fch® shareholders»
After 1921 the vehicle used were these taxes which were
designed to impose a penalty of such an amount as to fores the
corporations or induce the corporations to distribute the
money out by allowing a dividends-paid deduction.

It. is that

incentive that is at work here that w® wish to have--we wish
to have the market value of the property be the measure of
a dividend paid in property *

Ws fee 3. that that satisfies the

statutory and historical philosophy behind thesa taxes.
Q

What is directly at issue her® is whether or

not there; remained any undistributed personal holding company
income after this stock was paid out as a dividend, is it not?

MR. LEVENSON:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

As that phrase

MR. LEVEMSORs

in defined in the law.

in this case, whatactually happened,

as shown in the Appendix, is that the stockholders of our
clients received marketable securities of a value in excess of
their cost fco the corporation.. paid the normal incoxi© tax
kllocabit. to—

Q

As sh.arehoMe.rs.

MR. leveyson;

value of the property when it was distributed.
Q

But fch.® ©nhancsmemfc of the property had never

bsen reflected ;l:i thr-. corporate books as income.

16

MR. LEVENSONs

It had naver been reflected in the

corporate books as income.
Q

And the income that has been made and has been

reflected on the corporate books will not b© taxed—-will not
be distributed if you get this deduction at the market value.
MR. LEVENSON:

The second part of your statement.

Your Hbnor, I do not believe is the way the Congress intended
to look fit these taxes.

Congress was intending not. to—was

intending to tax the shareholders on art amount equal to the
amount which the Internal Revenue Service determined was
improperly accumulated.
Q

That amount is—•

But. the earnings that have been ■accumulated on

the books, and reflected on the books remain- in the company.
MR. LEVENSON;

Our point is that the earnings

reflected on the books' are reflected only on the books.

That

is, they are a bookkeeping entry.
Q

But they have been earned..

MR. LEVENSON;

They have been earned, but they have

been investee in other assets, Your Honor.

They have-been

invested in real estate, in stocks, in equipment and
machinery, whatever.
Q

And that—

But they aru subject to the ordinary corporate

income tax.
MR. LEVENSON;
Q

Yec, they are.

And they remain in the company undistributed.

to the rule for which we contend.

Q

The other way of looking at it would be had

those earnings been paid out, then this capital gain would
have remained in fch® company undistributed.
MR. LEVENSONs

The capital gain was nsver intended

to be taxed by the Congress»

In fact- Section 311 of the

Internal Revenue Cede specifically states

that property may

property may be distributed—without the corporation—

Without x«ccyiiitlm of gain or

the reasonable needs of "the business.

We believe that the

recognition of the fair market value in Ivan, Alien, for purposes
of computing what should be taxed, that that should also
apply to the other side of the coin in determining the value
of the dividends being paid out by the corporation.

We find

a symmetry in the reasoning of the majority in that case and
our position in this case.
I would like to call to the Court's attention the
loophole created by the government rule which can boat be
recognised by referring to the Gimerji 1 _ Se cur 1. ti as case, which
we cited in our main

brief, that being a case in the IS30s

where property with a very high basis and a low value was
distributed.

The Court prior

to -the 1936 act--the distribu­

tion occurred prior to the '61 act—the Court rofusod to give
a credit for the basis of the property and ruled that fair
market value was the basia for the credit to be given to the
distributing corporation.
The adjusted basis rule argued for by the government
has never appeared in any statute.

And as we pointed cut in

our brief, it is quits different from the rule that was in
existence prior to 1939.
I might also call tha Court's attention to tb®
explanation in the case of C. Blake McDowell of the
concurring judge

AFTERNOON SESSION
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. LEVEMSON:

Counsel., you may continue.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

»

court-—
Q

Mr, Levenson, may I ask you was there any

special reason for making this distribution in property rather
than cash?
MR, LEVENSON:

The reason was, Your Honor, that the

value of the property was sufficient to take out all of the
personal holding company income determined by the government.
The failure to sell the property of course saved the corpora­
tion tiie capital gains tax that it would otherwise have had to
pay.
Q
Q

So, it kept cash in the company.
Other assets.

MR. LEVENSON:

It kept other assets.

It kept

other assets in the company,

but that would have bean the case if these assets—
Q

It kept earnings in the company.

MR. LEVENSON:

Your Honor, I would like to go back

to the comments that you made concerning earnings a short
whi1® ago. •
Q

Questions.

MR. LEVENSON:

Questions.

A distributio;:'; can. never

be traced to s. specific earnings account.
of that nature just does not exist.

An earnings account

We discussed that point

21

in our reply brief and would like to again call your attention
to the point that we made in footnote one on that issue.
Earnings and profits are not a separate bank account.
are not a separata piece of property.
anything.

They

They are not. a separate

They are a historical record of corporate success

or failure.

Any distribution fee shareholders—-the taxation

of any distribution to shareholders is based
historical record.

upon that

That is what earnings and profits are.

Whether the money or property that is actually distributed
cams originally from earnings or from stock subscriptions or
from property acquired in a tax-free reorganization,, that is
completely irrelevant.
Q

But you know that the appreciation of this

property has not been reflected in that historical record.
MR. LEVENSON:

That is correct, Ycvr Honor, but

Congress made the value judgement in Section 311 of the Code
not to tax appreciation on property distributed by

corpora­

tions .
Q

I understand that.

MR. LEVENSON:

So, it is not a tax avoidance

maneuver that was engaged in by this taxpayer in making such
a dis fer i.. bu ti c m.
Q

But at least prior to '54, Congress had mads,

the judgment that in circumstances like this, on thane facts,
the deductior., would bo at the book value.

22

MR. LEVENSON:
Q

Is that not true?

MR. LEVENSON:
Q

To fully understand—

That is true, Your Honor.

And you suggest there is evidence that

Congress did not intend that under the '54 Code?
MR. LEVENSON:

We submit that Congress did not.
*

intend it in the '54 Cede.

But to answer your comment more

specifically, 1 think it is important to note the reason why
27(d) was incorporated into the Internal Revenue Code prior
to that time because that has obviously given everyone a great
deal of trouble in the consideration of this case.
Q

This is in the '39 Coda?

MR- LEVENSON:

It came into effect, in 1936.

It

carried over in the ”39 Cod®, which was merely a recodifica­
tion of all of its existing Internal Revenue laws at the time.
It did not involve a value judgment in compiling the 339 Code,
which sections were good and which were bad, as did the *54
Code.
There was a provision in the law which allowed
corporations to distribute property to another corporation.
The recipient corporation would receive that property as a
dividend, take it into account, take as its basis the market
value on the date of distribution, pay no cax upon that in the
corporate, dividend distribution because of an intercorporate
dividends received c-vadit, sell the appreciated property,

23
thersby having no tax imposed upon all of the gain.' What
Congress chose to do in 1936, in the context of the undis­
tributed profits tax that was enacted in that year, was to
restrict tha dividends-paid reduction to the lower of the
adjusted basis or value.
In th© '54 Cod© what Congress did to achieve
exactly th© same result was to distinguish the tax effects to
a corporato and a non-corporate distributee upon receipt; of
th® dividend from another corporation.
Q

Was this any corporate distributes or an

affilxa tad corporafclon?
MR. LEVENSON:
Q

Any corporate distributor.

Any corporate distributor.

MR. IiEVENSON:

Yes# sir.

We would like to conclude

that the role advocated by the government is neither reasonable
nor consistent with th© intent of Congress.
justified by fcho provisions of th® Code.
by resort to lagislative history,

It, is not

It is not. justified

in short, the regulation in

question, we believe, represents an arbitrary extension of
udsdnistrative authority and should ba struck down' as an
attempt to legislate by regulation.

The statutory direction

is that for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Cede a
dividend is defined by section 316 and its component parts.
Thank you.

ORAi ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL L. PAUP, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. PAUP:

Mr* Chief Justice, and may it please

th© Court:
The only issue her© is whether Section l„562-l(a)
of the regulations is valid.

These regulations of course

provid® that s. personal holding company's dividends-paid
deduction with respect to a distribution in kind should be
determined by the corporation’s adjusted basis.

Generally

it is investment in property distributed.
We submit that the First Circuit bolow was entirely
correct in holding that the regulations were consistent with
th© objectives and terms of the Revenue Act and were indeed
consistent with congressional intent.
To begin with, this Court has often held that great
deference should be accorded to interpretations given a
statute by the officers charged with its administration.
Indeed, this Court has held that Treasury regulations must
be sustained unless unreasonable and plainly inconsistent
with the revenue statutes.

The present regulations cannot

b© held deficient under those standards.
In our view, th© whole of petitioner's argument
that, these regulations are invalid is premised on an
unhistorical end oversimplified, view c? the personal holding
company and accumulated earnings taxes.

25
Essentially, petitioner's argument begins with the
preraise that personal holding company and accumulated earnings
taxes were designed to discourage the use of corporate vehicles
as a means of avoiding the progressive tax appoicable to
shareholders.

It then notes that individual shareholders are

taxable upon the full fair market, value of the property they
received from corporations as a distribution in kind.
The argument then jumps to the conclusion that the
only measure appropriate for determining the corporato
dividends pay deduction if? the measure used to determine the
amount includible in shareholder income.

That argument cannot

b® squared with history.
Historically the personal holding company tax end the
dividend-paid deduction fir at came into the Code Ik. 1934.

At

that time. Congress did not define specifically the effect a
distribution .of property Jr. kind would have with respect to
the corporation dividend-paid deduction.

The 1936 act,

however, soon filled that gap.
In 1936 Congress passed Section 27(c), a section
later recodified as Section 27(d) of the '39 Cods.,

And in. that

section it explicitly provided that a corporation's dividendpaid deduction with respect to a dividend in kina should be
determined by tbs lesser c/f basis or fair market value.

That

rule enacted by Congress in 1936 then would provide exactly the
same result as the rule under the regulations would effect with

26

respect to this taxpayer.
As a part of the same revenue act, the Revenue Act of
1936, Congress also defined exactly the effect a distribution in
kind would have upon individual shareholders.

In Section

115(j) of the *36 act Congress explicitly provided that share­
holder recipiente of distributions in kind should include those
distributions in their incomes to the full extent of th© fair
market value of th® property received.
In the face of this history, it is & little difficult
to concede how petitioners can now argue that the purpose of
the personal holding company tax would be fully served by a rule
that kayo corporate dividends-paid deductions to the amount
includable in shareholder income.

Obviously when Congress

faced the question in 1936, it concluded that such a rule would

not fully serve the purpose of the personal holding company tax.
Specifically, these taxes—the personal holding
company tax and the accumulated earnings tax—attached to
undistributed or accumulated taxable income those income items
specifically encompass-'

only fully realized income items,

income items realized and recognised at the corporate level.
The rule taxpayer advocates here would peri::it a deduction with
respect to those realized, fully recognised income items with
respect to income iteras that, have never been realized at the
corporat® leve1.

Is it your position that the basis should be

21

taken as the value of the distribution, whether the basis is
higher or lower than ths present market value?
MR. PAUP:

That is what the regulations provide,

Your Honor, yes.
Q

is there any fiscal advantage to the government

in the position you are taking?
MR. PAUP:

Clearly the law applicable under fch©

1936 act would generat® moro revenue, particularly with
respect to distributions of property that had depreciated in
value while hold by the corporation.

So, it is

fiscally

disadvantageous, but we think it is consistent—

So, you are just upholding the regulation as a

That is the

But I think it is instructive

to note that -the dividends-paid deduction also applies to the
accumulated earnings tax and equally had this been an

the corporation her© faced,

accumulated earnings would have remained accumulated at the
corporate level—
Q

If this ware a differant tax, there would b©

different problems.

But we are dealing here with s. personal

holding company tax.
MR. PAUP:

The result is the same though in either

case, Your Honor.
Q

We are dealing here with what is in effect a

confiscatory tax upon a corporation defined as a personal
holding company, unless tha corporation makes distributions
to its shareholders.
MR. PAUP:
Q

Yes.

And we all know what the purpose of it was back

in 1934, was to got away from incorporated yachts and race
horses and so on.
MR. PAUP:

And pocket-books, yes, Your Honor.

29
Q

Yes „

MR. PAUP

In our view, the only hope taxpayers have

of winning this case is to convince the Court that somehow the
thrust of the personal holding company tax changed drastically
in 1954,

We do not think that anything they have cited, either

in brief or in oral argument, indicates such a drastic shift
in the focus or the intent of the tax.

Quite clearly nothing

in the literal statutory language of the 1954 Cole evidences an
intention to shift the focus of the corporate dividend-paid
deduction away from th© effect that distribution has on the
corporation to the effect that that distribution has upon
shareholder income,
Q

indeed—

But the rule die change in •54, did it not?

MR. PAUPi

The regulations provido a slightly

different rule- from—
Q

Not for this case.

MR. PMJPs
Q

Not for this case, no.

Well, a quite different rule.

MR. PAUP:

A quite different rule for distributions

with respect to prop-arty that has depreciated—Q

Before the taxpayer got the worst cf whichever

world there was.
MR, RAUP:
Q

That ie exactly right.

Now lm gets s. fixed on©, whether it be* better or

worse than the other.

30
MR. PAUP:
Q

That, is right.

And in publishing their regulation, apparently

the government divined that this was the congressional will or
tills sort of interpretation of the statute was permissible.
MR. PAUP:

Specif:Lcally, 1 think they divined that

tills interpretation of the statute was permissible.

And I

think further--Q

There is a difference, whether this was

specifically congressional intent or whether

Congress intended

to give an area of discretion in drafting the regulation.
MR. PAUP:

I think basically the shift in the regula­

tion—our view is that the legislative history underlying the
'54 Code indicates that Congress intended to carry over
Section 27(d).
Q

Now, there are certain counterindications.
But that is not what the regulation says.

MR. PAUP;
Q

No, Your Honor.

There are--

What in the legislative history do you submit

indicates that. Congress intended to change the rule a little
bit, as you say?
MR. PAUP:

Specifically, in discussing the dividend-

paid deductior the Senate report makes reference to Section 312
of the Code.

We do not view that reference to Section 312 of

the Code as £ mere typographical error.

Thera are certain

ambiguities in the legislative history, we will grant.

Sac ion

purse nrovidea, for an adjustment at the

31

corporate level exactly the same and exactly equal adjustment
at the corporate level with respect to distributions in kind,
as does the present regulation.
Further, we think that the rule adopted by the
regulation is consistent with really the thrust of the taxes
involved.

As you have pointed out, the thrust of the taxes

involved is looking for the distribution of personal holding
company income.

To the extent a corporation distributes

property in which it has invested personal holding company
income presumably, it effects a distribution exactly equal to
the amount of its investment.

Therefore, we think the regula­

tion, not taking into account depreciations in value, is
entirely consistent with the tax.
Q

Even where it depreciates.

MR. PAUP:

Ye3, that is right, Your Honor, because

that depreciation has never been reflected on the corporate
books.
Q

Although it reflects an investment of income at

the amount that the property
MR. PAUP:

cost.

That is exactly right.

It is carried on

the corporate books at exactly its cost basis.
Q

Does a taxpayer accomplish any other avoidance

by distributing in property rather than cash than the capital
gains tax that he conceded he would?
MR. PAUP:

Under the facts of this case., it appears

32
not»

Just the capital gains tax.

Although the record is a

little vague.
Q

And this is whether ha wins or not on the

evaluation question?
MR. PAUP:

That is true, yes.

Inevitably he is going

to avoid capital gains tax at the corporate level,

in this Court's opinion in General utilities make it clear that
no income is recognized to the corporation upon the distribu­
tiori.
Q

Does he also avoid personal holding company

Q

He; avoids distributing it.

income?

MR. PAUP:

Oh, he avoids distributing personal

holding company income—well, only if he wins.
Q

Only if he wins, yes.

MR. PAUP:

If he loses, than the tax will attach to

the amounts of personal holding company income; which we say
rentaln undistributed.

Petitioner has even

Neither Section 56 2 of the Code nor

Section 316 of the Code provides a rule for valuing the
effect of a d5.3t.ribut.ion in kind at the corporate level.
Their® is certainly nothing in the committee report
/

33

that reflects in intention on the part of Congress to shift
the emphasis or the focus of the dividend-paid deduction
completely away from the corporation.

Indeed, there are certain

contrary indications, as I have pointed out.

Specifically the

reference to the 300 Code provisions and more particularly the
reference in the Senate Committee report to Section 312 gives a
certain legislative warrant, for applying the adjusted basis
rule under these circumstances.
And, more to the point, as a practical, matter, that
is the logical rule that should be applied--that is, the
distribution out of the corporate shell for both accounting and
tax purposes, other tax purposes.
Q

Then do you say 27 (d) was illogical?

MR. PAUP:

27(d) ,m -think reflects a punitive—almost

a punitive-—goal with respect to distribution of property that
had depreciated.

The. net effect of that secti.or. is to require

that either the personal holding company realize losses at the
corporat® level and actually realize a diminution in corporate
assets or distribute more of its invested property, more of its
invested earnings, than it has undistributed personal holding
company incono in order to obtain a deduction equal to the
amount of its undistributed personal holding company income.

So, in effect,- it reflects a congressional gc-al feo see the end
of these personal holding companies.
Q

The whole personal holding company—all of the

34

provisions are punitive in a sense.

They take away any

incentiva to incorporata your pocketbook, put. it that way.
MR. PAUP:
Q

Oh, there is no doubt about that.

In that sens3 at least they were punitive pro­

visions .
MR. PAUP:

They are a healthy inducement to distribu-

felons of realized personal holding company income.
Q

And remove any incentive whatsoever to incorpor­

ate.
MR. PAUP:

Practically speaking, yes.

We do not find anything in either the legislative
history or in this Court's opinion in Ivan Allen

which runs

contrary to our position here.
Q

What do you think the bearing cf the Ivan

Allen case has?
MR. PAUP:
no direct basring.

On the specific problem here, there is
But I think certain dictums in the Court's

opinion clearly supports the result here.
Q

Both you and your brother on the other side of

the table, at th© other table, more or less rely on Ivan Allen..
Each of you thinks it gives you at least some support.
MR. PAUP;

Yes, Your Honor, I think it does give us

some support.
Q

And how and why?

MR. PAUP:

As this Court pointed out, the accumulated

35
earnings tax specifically involved in Ivan Allen attaches only
to realized income items, unrealised appreciation figures not
at all in the computation of actual tax liabilities.

We think

that almost by a parody of reasoning that unrealized appreciation
ought not to figuro in a deduction critical to the computation
of a tax attaching only to realized income items.
Under this Court's opinion in Ivan Allen» unrealised
appreciation is important only in determining whether a
corporation has a reasonable business need to accumulate fully
realized income items.

That affects only the purpose of this

accumulations, not the computation of the taxes involved.

We

think the opinion clearly indicates that unrealized appreciation
ought not to figure in the computation of the tax.

And under

our rule, that unrealised appreciation does not figure in the
computation.
Petitioner's rule, on the other hand, would permit
a deduction from realized .income, items for appreciation that™

You mean unrealized.

Ho, I c«x sorry, I intended to s*:.y

Q

But Ivan Allan does tend to the proposition that

in computing accumulated earnings and profits,, the taxpayer
must take into account; the unrealized appreciation of the
security that-—
MR. PAUP:

No, I do not really think it really stands

for that proposition, Your Honor.

It stands for the proposi­

tion that in determining whether a taxpayer has a reasonable

The motive, right°

In sum, I guess , it is our view that the regulations
here represent a reasonable interpretation of the revenue
statutes involved.

They are consistent with the history.

They

are consistent with the purpose, that purpose being to force
a distribution of unrealized personal holding company income.
They are consistent with the terms and focus of the tax
involved, that focus being oh only unrealised income items.
They are finally consistent with the tax treatment accorded
corporate distributions in kind for other purposes—general
accounting purposes, accounting for purposes of earnings and
profits under Section 312.
In our view, the First Circuit was correct in sus­
taining them.

And we would submit that its decision ought to

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL D. LEVENSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LEVENSON;

Comment was made that--a question was

asked., rather, whether the Congress intended to give to the
Treasury an area of discretion in promulgating regulations under
this statute»

I would like t© point out to the Court that in

the Internal Revenue Cod© in particular, when Congress intends
to give broad discretionary power to the Treasury, it specifi­
cally indicates, such as in the consolidated return regulations,
allocation of income and deductions between taxpayers and other
broad areas where Congress has stated its policy and says to
the Treasury, "You fill it in."

Those are known as legislative

regulations and ar© usually given great weight by the courts.
My brother says that we, taxpayer's counsel, agree
that nothing in the Code dictates hew a dividend in property
is to b© valued at th® corporate level.

That is not correct.

We do not agree that the Code is silent on that.

In fact, we

state that th® Code indicates the unitary integrated concept
about which we referrede and that this is th© same method of
valuing a dividend at 'the corporate level as at the shareholder
level.
The regulation does not require that we prove, that
ths property has bean purchased with personal holding company
income.

The corporation can distribute property that has bean

acquired in any manner.

The adjusted basis rule does not

39

necessarily reflect personal holding company income» that is#
the adjusted basis of property.

For example, if I had

Penn

Central stock of high basis and low value and had a personal
holding company, I could under fchs government's rule., contribute
that stock to the corporation, a non-taxable ©vent, the following
year or even maybe the same year have that corporation distribute
out that high basis property and take away the personal holding
company tax potential.

That is the way adjusted basis can be

utilized to defeat the intention of Congress and what should
be the intention of the Treasury.
Comment was made that prior to 1936 there was no
valuation rule.

W® believe that prior to 1936, the Court

believed that the value of the dividend was to be the value of
the property distributed, and it was only in the context of
the undistributed profits tax in 1936 that the rule was changed,
that it was not changed because Congress looked and thought
hard on this issue but rather it was changed to accomplish the
closing of the loophole that I referred to in the main portion
of my argument.
Q

Basically, unless you got into intercorporate

distribution,, it did not make any difference, did it, in on
ordinary corporation because it was a corporation prior to the
penalty on undistributed earnings?
MR. LEVENSON:
Q

But we could, Your Honor.

Could declare dividends out of its earnings and

40

profits in any amount in the discretion of the board of
directors.
MR. LEVENSON:
Q

But the nature of the undistributed--

And it was clear that the value to the share­

holders was the fair market value of what was distributed.
That has always been clear, has it not?
MR. LEVENSON:

Or the adjusted—oh, excuse me, yes,

Your Honor.
Q

To the shareholders.

MR. LEVENSON:
Q

Yes.

To the shareholders at the fair market value of

what is distributed from the point of view of their income.
MR. LEVENSON:

That is correct.

But 1:h(2 nature of

the undistributed profits tax of 1936 was a ceeiplately
different animal than either cf the normal incoiTS ter or the
penalty taxes,
Q

My point is that before 1936 it did not make

any difference.

How could it arise to the corporation as a

taxpayer?
MR. LEVENSON:

Prior to nineteen—-yes, Your Honor,

you are correct.
Q

The issue ecuId not arise vis-a-vis the

corporation's tax returns, could it?
MR. LEVENSON:
to 1936

Not wader the statutes existing prior

41
Q

That was ray question.

MR. LEVENSON:
Q

Yes.

Mro Levenson, on your loophole argument, even

under the government's view, could not the corporation that has
stock that has a market value of less than its basis simply
sell the stock and take -the loss and then distribute the
money?

Would it not. all come out the same?

Or am I missing

something there?
MR. LEVENSON:

If the corporation distributed the

residue left after sale—
Q

Right, and took a tax loss because it is selling

for less than basis.
MR. LEVENSON:

It might take a tax loss against its

normal corporate income tax, but it will not thereby be able
to take out all of the accumulated taxable income or personal
holding company income under the government's rule because it
will be distributing cash, the proceeds of the sale of the
assets.
Q

on

But it. would also reduce its income by the loss

the stock.
MR. LEVENSON:

Not under the different ways that

capital gains and ordinary income—
Q

Because th® capital loss would not be a hundred

cents on the dollar.
MR. LEVENSON:

It would not be a hundred cents on the

42
dollar* Your Honor.
Q

I see.
