REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF:
SANFORD SVETCOV, ESQ,

P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No, 76-446, Raymond K. Procunier v. Apolinar Navarette,
Mr» Svetcov, I think you may proceed when you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SANFORD SVETCOV, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR, SVETCOV:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
May I, at the outset, reserve five minutes of my
time for rebuttal?
The question presented by this case is whether a
complaint alleging that state prison officials negligently
lost 13 items of a prisoner's outgoing mail in 1971 and 1972
states a cause of action under 42 United States Code Section
1903 of the Civil Rights Act.

,

This question reached this Court in the-following
way:
On January 4th, 1974, Respondent Navarette, with
u.a.£?

present counsel, filed a second amended complaint in the

United States District Court for the Northern District of
California, solely for damages.

He alleged that while he

was a California prisoner in 1971 and 1972 at Soiedad Prison,
13 items of i;.s outgoing mail were not received by his
addressees.

6.

In his first end second causes of action, he
alleged that the Defendant deliberately refused to send these
letters either, one, in knowing disregard or two, in bad faith
disregard of :he prisoner's First Amendment right of free
expression.
These causes of action are not before the Court
today.
In his third cause of action, it is alleged that
the letters were not received because the Defendant negligent­
ly and inadver tantly mishandled the mail.

It is this cause,

of action and only this cause of action which is before this
Court today.
Now, there is one matter, Your Honor, I would like
to sat to one side at this time.

There is a suggestion in

Respondent's brief in this Court that the claim of mail loss
involved or resulted in a denial of access to the courts as
well as the denial of free expression.
That is not the case.

I must point out that in

the lower courts, Respondent expressly stated the following,
and I quote;

‘The claim against mail interference does not

purport to allege denial of access to the courts,’'' and we
take Counsel and Respondent at his word.
QUESTION:
?-IS.
17.

He told us —

Where do we find that in

SVSTCOV:

the Appendix?

You find that in the record at page

.it is not s.n the Appendix.

It was not printed for the

5

Appendix but it is in the record that was sent from the Ninth
Circuit to this Court.
It also appears in the reply brief in the Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals at page 7 and page 9.
QUESTION :

Mow

May I ask a question about that parti­

cular point?
MR. SVETCOV:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Does it really matter?

As I understand

your submission, it is that an allegation of negligence is
insufficient under 1983.

Are you suggesting there are

different standards depending on what the Constitutional
violation is?
MR. SVETCOV:
QUESTION:
access to the

I am not —

In other words,, if it were denial of

courts, perhaps negligence would be enough?

HR, SVETCOV:
ting that at ill.

Mr. Justice Stevens, I am not sugges­

I am just trying to clear up a matter that

seems to have reappeared in the briefs in this Court that I
thought had been cleared up earlier and was not before this
Court and I want to make that clear, that a denial of access
is not the question here.
QUESTION:

But your basic position is that even if

it were before us, your argument would be precisely the same?
MR. SVETCOV:
QUESTION:

Correct.

Well, Counsel, ars we focusing here on

6

some sort of a gloss that is added to the burden of proof of
a Plaintiff because the action is brought under 1933 or
should we focus on the definition of the Constitutional, right
itself?
Supposing this case had been brought, in the Super­
ior Court of California where you do not have to rely on 1983
to be accorded general jurisdiction?

Would your argument be

the same?
MR

SVETCOV:

No? California has a procedure; for

suing public officials who act negligently and so#in tort law
and it would not be a Constitutional cause of action at alio
QUESTION:

Well, but could you not assert a 14th

Amendment claim in the Superior Court of whatever county
Soledad is located in?
MR

SVETCOV:

As a matter of fact? Your Honor, the

California Supreme Court has held in the last two years that
they have concurrent jurisdiction under Section 1983 and
would entertain

and the state courts may entertain 3.983

causes of act:'.on in the state courts.,
QUESTION:

Yes, but doss it take 1983 to enable a

superior court, to entertain a
MR., SVETCOV:

Constitutional cause of action?

Probably not.

I think there would

be independent state causes of action available.
QUESTION:

What do you conceive to be the Consti­

tutional right -that the Respondents assert here?

7
MR,. SVETCOV:

The Respondents assert an inmate’s

right, of free expression in the mail.

I have to remind the

Court again and again that it is the inmate who is bringing
this suit.

It is not the addressees and that kind of gets me

to the second part of my argument now but the point we make
in the second part of our argument in our briefs is that in
Procunier vernus Martinez in 1974, this Court did not find a
right of free expression in the inmate, it found a right of
free expression in free person correspondent.
Now, if the free parson correspondents were
bringing this suit, perhaps we would have a different case
insofar as what the Constitutional right was that was involved.
We may not. have a different case insofar as whether negligence
or intent is before us.
QUESTIONS

What if we were to decide in this case

that the point reserved in Justice Powell’s opinion in
Procunier against Martinez should foe resolved in favor of the
Respondent, that is, that there is a right of inmates to
communicate by letter.

Do you think that

Constitutional

right would he violated if a prison truck carrying mail down
to the local Post Office negligently went off £he road?
'V:
QUESTION:
do with 1983,

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

Yet that does not. turn on anything to

That turns on a definition of the Constitu­

tional rights, does it not?

8
MR. SVETCOV:

Well, my understanding of 1983 is

that you do not state a causa of action under 1983 unless you
can first find the Constitutional deprivation.
QUESTION:

What would happen if the truck went off

the road every day accidentally?
MR, SVETCOV:

Your Honor, I think that if the truck

went off the road every day.
QUESTION:

Accidentally,

MR. SVETCOV:

Accidentally.

That a cause of action

could be stated under Your Honor’s formulation ir. Estelle
versus Gamble,

that that might constitute sufficient evidence

to support a claim of deliberate indifference and Respondent
here has two claims of intentional tort of deliberate refusal,
of deliberate indifference under which he may attempt to
assert that what happened to him constitutes that.
QUESTION:

How many times was his mail negligently

not delivered:-'
MR, SVETCOV:

The allegation in this complaint is

that 13 items of mail, over a period of one and a half years,
were not delivered.
record

I should point out,, Your Honor, that the

in this case showsthat over 150 pieces of special-

purpose mail, that is, mail to attorneys, reporters, courts,
public officials ware mailed on behalf of the Respondent and
this is in addition to routine correspondence

to family and

friends of which no record is kept in the California prison

9
system? so what we are looking at is 13 pieces of mail out
of at least more than 150 that records were kept ofi

we do

not know how many more of which no records were kept.
Your Honor, in a case I tried in the U.S. District
Court two year's ago concerning San Quentin Prison, a prison
comparable, in fact, to Soledad, the record was undisputed
that over 3,000 to 4,000 pieces of mail were handled per day.
If you translate that into a year and a half, you
are talking in excess of one and a half million pieces of
mail and all we have a complaint of in this case is that 13
pieces were lost in that period.
Thirteen out of one and a half million is a very
small fraction.

We have no other allegation in this complaint

that any other prisoners were subjected to this.
QUESTION:

But that is admitted.

For the purpose

of this case, it .is admitted.
MR, SVETCOV:
tly.

That 13 pieces were lost.

Negligen­

Yes.
Lai: me, get back to my discourse.
QUESTION:

Before you get back, would you say,

would you approach this case on the assumption that 13 pieces
were lost negligently?
MR. SVETCOV:

That is the allegation in the com­

plaint*
QUESTION:

Would you say it was just through

10
negligent conduct in tie sense that,, such as Mr. Justice
Rehnquist was suggesting, that they just negligently lost
them in a truck somewhere or. in a fire or -— is that what
you are saying?
MR

Would you approach it that way?

SVETCOV:

Well, let me quote from Respondent's

brief in this Court?
QUESTION:

Or that he thought ha was following a

regulation and just misread it?
MR, SVETCOV?

Well, in this Court, Respondent

states the fo .lowing, that the mail was
or mislaid due to inadvertent
QUESTION:

unaccountably lost

mishandling."

So it is sort of — it would be an

unconscious act of which — just a negligent act?
MR, SVETCOV?

All right, there was one piece of

mail on which he makes a specific allegation that it was
refused mailing and that then a reason was given for the
r^iiisal bv.u I find that not to bear on this negligence claim
fcaccuse there was a deliberate refusal and a reason was given.
That does not fall within our

negligence cause of action.

That .tails vi-hin the deliberate cause of action.
Qu

I ON s

But if you read page 12 of the Appendix

at paragraph, two of the third cause of action it says,
befendant :.ie jlrgently and inadvertently misapplied the
pr i s one r rna i 1 re g n la ti on s.
MR. SVETCOV:

That is correct, Your Honor.

QUESTIONS

It seems to me you could, under the

rules of pleading, show that they refused to mail that be­
cause they did not properly understand the regulations,
rather than that this got left in a drawer when everybody
else *s mail went ahead.
MR. SVETCOV:

Well, Justice Rehnquist, that might

be true in the ordinary case where only one cause of action
was alleged but the fact is in this case, three causes of
action are alleged with respect to the mail and in the first
two, the allegations are that there was a deliberate refusal
to send the mail, deliberate refusal,
Nov, in the third cause of action, the allegation
is a negligent and inadvertent mishandling and misapplication
ot: the regulations but I take that to mean pure carelessness,
not that they misunderstood the rules.

I took that to be

what was happening with respect to the deliberate refusal.
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, you are reading

the brief rather than the pleading.

As Justice Rehnquist

points out, the language is, "Practum is a result of inter­
ference with e r confiscation of such correspondence by reason
of negligent understanding of the rules"'and so forth.

The

word '’confiscation and interference" certainly is not -just
ordinary mishandling, is it?

That is not a truck going off

the bank of the river or whatever you want.
MR.- SVETCOV:

Well, Your Honor, as I understand

11-A
these three causes of action, as they have been pleaded
through four complaints in the lower courts, they were dealt
v/ith below as two causes of action for deliberate refusal,
the third cause of action for negligent loss of the mail.
That is the way they have been dealt with below.
This is not a Haynes v, Koerner situation where Respondent
does not have counsel.

He has counsel.

Counsel was the same

counsel throughout, from the Second Amendment complaint on
and I have to take counsel at his word that what he means by
his complaint is that the mail was unaccountably lost or mis­
laid by inadvertent mishandling.
QUESTION:

Do you think we should look at the

brief rather than the pleading itself?

Isn't the test still

the test under any conceivable facts can be shown under the
pleading that will entitle him to relief and so forth and so
on?
MR. SVETCOV:

If -- under any conceivable fact, if

the allegation is confiscation, it seems to me that confisca­
tion can be dealt with at trial under twin allegations that
are not betore this Court, namely, deliberate
QjISTIOM:

indifference.

Nell, but it is negligence in the. sense

that he did not study the regulations and realized that this
was not the kind of mail he was supposed to refuse to deliver?
MR. SVETCOV;
QUESTION:

Well, that —

It would be, the particular act was

12
intentional, but the negligence is in failing to study the
regulations and then there is a second allegation about negli­
gence in the supervisors not training their people and how
they handled ;he mail.

That is not the kind of negligence

you are talking about with a truck going off the road, is it?
MR, SVETCOV:

Well, that is the kind of negligence

which the Court of Appeals held stated a cause of action and
that is the kind of negligence we took in our petition to
certiorari to this Court to ask this Court to say does not
state a cause of action.
QUESTION:

'veil, Mr. Sveteov, let me interrupt you

once more and than I will fry to keep my mouth shut because
I have taken more of your time than I should.

Isn't it pos­

sible that the: Court of Appeals could be wrong and yet this
part of the complaint stay the claim for relief?
■ v.r

?1

MR SVETCOV:

Only if it was construed to state a

claim for relief for deliberate indifference and that the
confiscation was repeated, was

bo

repeated as to constitute

a deliberate indifference to the right of free expression.
But. to say that an act of inadvertence and mistake
is — constitutes a constitutional deprivation as opposed to
a tort, I have difficulty with construing it as a constitu­
tional deprivetion.
My point is that if it happens often enough as
alleged, the answer is the causes of action and deliberate

13
indifference recognised by the Court.
It is not in a windfall cause of action in negli­
gence.

In other words, negligence is traditionally dealt

with in tort law.
Let's put ourselves in the area of injunctive
relief.

I suppose that if Respondent was seeking an injunc­

tion, he could, by requesting a simple order, do away with
an entire body of tort law.
told, "Thou

All public officials will be

; halt not be negligent" and I am sure that a

district court could enter such an order, but whether such an
order would be efficacious is doubtful and the point I am
making is that it seems to me that 1983 is a deterrent statute
and not a compensation statute and the deterrence that it is
i
aimed at is the deterrence of deprivations of constitutional
rights.
QUESTION:

That you should not destroy this man's

mail, negligerfcly or non-negligently.

What is wrong with

And I use the word "negligently" as you used it, which

is not the way I use it.
MR

SVSTCOV:

QUESTION;

Your Honor —

Well, tell me, what do you mean by, in

this case, what was the negligence?
MRc SVETCOV;

The negligence, as I Understand it,

is the unintended — unintended conduct which resulted in a
loss to the 0dainti££,unintended.

14
QUESTION:

Well, what about those words?

is no "unintended" in those words.

There

It is deliberately.

Is

that not what you add up to?
MR, SVETCOV:

The allegation in causes of action

one and two is deliberate.

The allegation in cause number

three has not been construed to be an allegation of deliberate
refusal.

It has been construed to be an allegation of

neglicence.
QUESTION:

Negligent in understanding the statute?

Understanding the rules?

Or negligently going to sleep?

Or

negligently driving off the road?
MR. SVETGOV:

The complaint alleges negligent and

inadvertent misapplication of the rules.
QUESTION:

Do you put inadvertence in the same

place as negligence?
MR. SVETCOV:

I put it in the same place because

that is the allegation in the complaint.

The complaint says

that the Defendant negligently and inadvertently misapplied
the prisoner nail regulations and as I understand "inadver­
tent -—!i

The man says, Here is a letter written, to his

lawyer and the man "Negligently misunderstands the rules and

MR. SVETCOV;

Is that negligence? .
He burns it up?

QUESTION:

Yes,

MR, SVETCOV:
QUESTION:

Is that negligence?

No, that is not negligence.

Well, is that possibly what you are

talking about here?
MR. SVETCOV:

I do not think that is what they are

talking about at all.
QUESTION:

They could be though, could they not?

MR. SVETCOV:

I have to take counsel at his word

when he says *—
QUESTION:

Well, he said —

MR. SVETCOV:

— it was unaccountably lost or mis­

laid due to inadvertent mishandling.

He is not talking about

burning it upr Your Honor.
QUESTION:

He said, "Negligently on the rules."

What did he say about —
MR. SVETCOV:

He said, "Negligently and inacver"

tently misapplied the rules."
QUESTION:

That is not negligence, as I understand

it.
MR, SVETCOV:

Well, Your Honor, that may well be

true but the point is, that is the understanding —
QUESTION:

Do you understand that he violated the

rules inadvertently?
MR. SVETCOV
QUESTION:

And unintentionally, yes.

But he did violate the rules?

16

MR., SVETCOV:

That appears to be the case, or at

least he misapplied them.

Whether violated

are the same thing, I 3o not know.

and misapplied

lie may have applied a

different rule -— a raile to the wrong type of mail.

That is

one way of construing it.
QUESTION:

At a trial we would have found all that

out, would we not have?
MR,, SVETCOV:

At a trial we will still find it out

because there can ba a trial under the first and second causes
of action, Yoiar Honor.
QUESTION:

Does the single question on which we

granted certiorari — there was a limited grant, was there
not?
MR, SVETCOV:
QUESTION:

Thera was a limited grant.

Does that include the question of

Whether there, indeed, is a constitutional right with respect
to the mail?
MR. SVETCOV:
QUESTION:

Let me —

Or do we adjudicate this case oa the

assumption that there was a constitutional right which the
prison guards should have known?
MR. SVETCOV'

Well, the certified question reads

as follows, Mr. Justice White, "Whether negligent failure to
mail certain of the. prisoner's letters states a cause of
action under Section 1983?"

This was addressed to the

17
determination of the Ninth Circuit.
QUESTION;

So you think, then, arguably, anyway,

the case involves the question of — even if there was a
deliberate loss here, a deliberate refusal to mail, that
whether or no:: the state is liable because no adjudicated
right in the mail had aver — would have been known by them?
MR. SVETCOV:

oh, yes, that is correct.

That is

our position.
QUESTION;
MR
negligence

And is that issue here, do you think?

SVETCOV;

That issue is here insofar as the

claim is concerned because even as to the negli­

gence claim there must foe an underlying constitutional depri­
vation and regrettably, Your Honors did not certify the first
two questions because we would have welcomed -— we would be
happy to be here- arguing that there was no Hirst Amendment
deprivation ir

1971 and 1972 even if there was deliberate

refusal to send the mail.
QUESTION;

Well, did you argue that in your brief?

MR. SVErCQV;

Well, we argue it, but we do argue

it. as a oackstop to the negligence point.
QUESTION:

Well, that is subsumed in the question, '

is it not?
MR. SVETCOV.:

That is subsumed in the question

certified.
QUESTION;

It a. deliberate interference with the

18
mail would not constitute a constitutional violation, then,
of course, the a fortiorari one does not.

That is your point,

is it not?
MR, SVETCOV:
QUESTION:

That is absolutely correct.

And even if

a deliberate loss of the

mail would be a violation of a constitutional right, it may
be that they might not be liable because the right had not
been adjudicated.
MR

SVETCOV:

That is absolutely correct and that

is what Your Honor sail in Procunier versus Martinez, that
prior to that case, the state of the law as to prisoner mail
was totally uncertain, that prison officials had no basis for
knowing what to do wita it and it seems to me that Procunier
versus Martinoz applies precisely to our defendants.
Hot

are they expected to anticipate this Court a

decision in 1174?
QUESTION:

So if we agreed with you on that parti­

cular point, v;e would need to get any farther with how much
1903 deals with just mishandling
MR

SVETCOV:

QUESTION:

That is correct

Then we would not get to the point of

the question of whether there is, in fact, the underlying
substantive constitutional right, because at least it had not
been enunciated prior to this decision.
MR.. SVETCOV:

That is right.

That is right.

You

19
could resolve the case that way.

Now, we had hoped that this

case would be decided upon in the lead point, whether, under
any circumstances, negligence, negligent action could invade
a constitutional right and our position on that, as stated in
our brief, is that it cannot and should not.
QUESTION:

Of course, another way of puttincf that

might be that some constitutional rights are rights against
deliberate ac "ion, that the right itself is against deliberate
action, not against negligence.
MR-. SVETCOV:

Well, you know, Your Honors have

cited a number of cases about a number of constitutional
rights and I can think of no case yet decided by this Court
where you did not require some sort of intent and I am
thinking of Washington versus Davis, where you s&y there has
to be a purposeful denial of equal protection.

I am thinking of Estelle versus Gamble.

There has

to be a deliberate indifference before you can have cruel
and unusual punishment.
I am thinking of the whole body of Fourth Amendmast law.

All. illegal arrests and illegal searches and

seizures are deliberate acts.
-•ft

Bishop versus Wood, Your Honor, in the Due

Process case involving the employer and their employee, that
?

Justice Stevens read, my recollection of your language is
that the Due Process t *.ause was not uo be used as a means for

20

federal courts to resolve all mistakes by public officials,
that there has to be some sort of motive to deprive of a right
QUESTION:

Suppose — if a mail truck negligently

hit somebody on his way to church, he would hardly have a
claim that the government had interfered with his free exer­
cise of.religion.
MR, SVETCOV:

Well, that reminds me of some hypo­

thetical in Amicus * brief.

The first hypothetical was that

if a prisoner was walking across the exercise yard and negli­
gently run down by a truckdriver, that, he would concede,
did not state a ©aysse* rf action but. Somehow if the prisoner
was walking across the yard and was on his way to church,
that would invade his First Amendment rights to worship and
I simply cannot see that unless the truck driver knew that the
fellow was going to church and ran him down, how the First
Amendment right could be implicated.
QUESTION:

Ran him down deliberately.

MR,, SVETCOV:
QUESTION:

Right, ran him down deliberately.

Not negligently.

MR, SVETCOV:

Not negligently.

He couldn’t — if

he knew of the right, and he ran him down, I think an infer­
ence would be drawn.
QUi-;bTxON:

Well, if he did it deliberately, you

a ' nor. need to call on the First Amendment, do you?
Ffh SVETCOVi

We could^try him in state court for

21
murder, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

What if he just did not like the guy —

he was not trying to prevent him from going to church, he
just wanted to kill him?
MR. SVETCOV:

We would try

him in the state court

for murder.
QUESTION:

Would there be a 1333 cause of action

for violation of bis religious freedom?
MR, SVETCOV:

As I understand this

Court's

decision, there has to be a combination of an intent to do
the act and a consciousness in some fashion that a constitu­
tional right would be implicated.
QUESTION:

Well, what about taking somebody's life

in the course of your official duties on purpose?
MR,

SVETCOV:

You know, the debates on. this Act

considered that in connection with Section two of the Ku Klux
Act.

If you recall, the original version

of that Act listed

a certain number of crimes, murder, mayhem, assault with
respect to the Ku Klux Klan and the opponents pointed out
that the Due Process Clausa has never been

sought, to protect

life, liberty or property, that those kinds of action were

Would you say that a prison guard who

beats up a prisoner is not violating 1983?

22
QUESTION!

Now, tha Screws case said the only

way it cot.Id apply is for the guard to say as he was shooting
him that "I am shooting you to deny you your constitutional
rights-”

That is what this Court said in the Screws case.
Am I right?
MR. -SVETCOV:

It said that the word "willfully”

in Section 242 of 18 U.S. Code required proof, either by
direct or circumstantial evidence that the Defendant ir.tended
to deprive the victim of a constitutional right.

QUESTION?

Which means he had to say as ha was

shooting him, "I am shooting you for the purpose of denying
you your rights."
MR- SVETCOV:

Well, he has to either s&y that or

have fold someone that on his way to the shooting.
QUESTION:

Or written a letter.

Well, let us say that it is perfectly

clear that he deliberately — a state officer deliberately

Certainly, Justice Stevens.

Do you think there is a difference

between a negligence Cc.se involving a truck going off the

gence allegation such as one may read this complaint as
making in which the negligence alleged is that the officers
did exactly what they thought they were supposed to do and
the particular acts they did were deliberate in that sense,
but there was negligence either in their failing to read
their regulations or ir. their superiors in instructing them.
Is this case the same as, in your view, as the
case involving just sloppy handling of the mail?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL S. ADAMS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR: ADAMS:

Yes, sir.

May it please the Court:
I would like to say initially that we are prema­
ture in standing- kero iefore you for the reason that we have
not yet had. our trial.

We have not vet developed a suffi­

cient record to provide this Honorable Court with the cletealled information, the factual predicate to reach a de­

MR,, ADAMS:

point of judicial economy, for making the remand now and

Mr. Adams, don’t you think we realised

that when we voted to take this case?
Well, could you not assume that and proceed with
your argument?
MR, ADAMS:

Certainly, Your Honor.

Let me just

27
pass down that initial point —
QUESTION:
MR* ADAMS:

And save the judicial time*
If it is the wish, then? of the Court

to reach a determination, then, at this point with respect
to negligence, let me say that there are two basic reasons
that it seems to me that negligence should be allowed as a
cause of action in respect to the First Amendment and they
go to the purposes of that Amendment, the purposes that
Congress had in mind, those purposes being, as I understand
them, deterrence in compensation.
In dealing first with deterrence, this Court care­
fully explored the question of the extent to which compensa tion

should .. 2 provided and the extent to which immunity

should be allowed to state officials in relation to conduct
involving the exercise of discretion and in the cases of
Scheuer v„ Rhodes and hood v, Strickland, that I aiji sure Your
Honors are extremely familiar with, that balance was struck
with a certain degree of deference given to the importance of
state officials engaging in decisive action and acknowledge­
ment that the public interest called for that.
Now, what we may well have here on the part of
those officials who were exercising discretion in relation
to the regulation, of prisoner mail is a failure to act, an
abdication from the exercise of any discretion whatsoever, a
xa.?.lure to ioo.'-' at the options and if Petitioner’s recuost is

23
honored by this Court and if the opportunity to obtain money
liability against such state officials as those is the
effective result of a determination by this Court, that, in
effect, is granting absolute immunity for a complete abdica­
tion.

It undercuts the very moving rationale of Scheuer v.

Rhodes and Wood v„ Strickland.
If we look for a moment for guidance to the
common law, as this Court has in deciding immunity questions
in relation to 1983, we will find that the common law, when
it deals with conduct that is not the exercise of discretion
but, rather, ministerial in character, liability and negli­
gence is generally allowed.
And,

This is the prevailing rule.

indeed
QUESTION:

Are you talking about the contours of

the First Amendment rights or about some limitation:that
1983 puts on the First Amendment right?
y

t!-

■'

MR. ADAMS:

I am talking about the limitations

that 1983 would put on litigation under any constitutional
guarantee, including the First Amendment.
QUESTION:
i •'
.1,.

In other words —

5fou think, then, if you had brought

an action in the Superior Court of

California under the

Constitution, assuming you could do that, where you were not
limited by whatever limitations 1983 may impose, that there
would ba no question that you could recover, say, for a
negligent failure to get the mail out of the prison as the

29

result of a truck accident;?
MR, ADMS:

If we assume, in your hypothetical,

Your Honor, that common law immunities and limitations to
those common law immunities as established, for example, in
California, governed, yes, I would have no problem with the
immunity because we ara dealing with negligence, at least in
the form of failure to act — inadvertent failure to act.
We are not talking about the exercise of discre­
tion and California has made perfectly clear, in the case I
have cited in my brief, Johnson v. State, that even where
discretion ought to be exercised but in the actual fact of
the instance that caused an injury, it was not, then the
immunity that ordinarily would enclose that particular
official or the governmental entity that he represents, is
not available and that official stands fully exposed to
negligence liability as though the act were ministerial from
the outset.
QUESTION:

Well, what if you have a situation

where the ci ty has a park with an amplifier system: that, it
makes available to all sorts of political groups and you
represent a group that has had the park made available to it
and the amplifier system breaks down due to failure of
proper maintenance on the part of the city.

Is that a viola­

tion of your croup's amendment rights?
MR. ADAMS:

Okay, I would say not, Your Honor.

30

QUESTION:

Why is that different from the mail

truck running off the road?
MR. ADAMS:

Well, let me answer that in two ways.

First of all, let me say at the outset that I quite agree
with certain of the questions of the Court's that ware
addressed to the Petitioner, that my third cause of action
deals with misreading of the regulations and it does not
purport to include factual inadvertence by subordinates —
you know, subordinate prison officials such as posed in that
mail truck hypothetical.
In answer, however, to your hypothetical, and
also to a situation of misreading of regulations such ns
directly raised in my third amendment, third cause of action,
I think we need to look at the overall course of action, the
overall pactern or implied policy that is being pursued by
the subordinate officials to decide if there is liability or
not.
In other words, there is a balancing test that
needs to be undergone and we need to look at the severity
and degree of the harm that is being risked to the people,
you inow, who are subject to the power of that particular
governmental official

and I would concede that an isolated

instance cf inadvertent conduct by an official who is otherwise prudent, you know, who is not an official who engages
habitually in careless conduct, be that careless misreading

31
of regulations or be that being careless in driving the mail
truck down the road, then there is no liability under 1983
for such an official.
QUESTION:

Is there any carelessness under 1983,

MR. ADAMS:

Well, indeed, I would believe that

though?

there is, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

I - as I have sought to contend
Well, certainly, 1983 was a Ku Klux

Klan Act
MR

ADAMS:

QUESTION:

And they were not careless.

were debating that act,

existing causes of action that are not before this Court
would cover the matter but if, on the other hand, we have a
sloppy misreading of the regulations or sloppy practices in
terms of unwritten — you know, the unwritten supplemental
rules that may well exist at the Soledad Prison level that I
do not know about yet because all X received in the summary
judgment motion were the statewide regulations that Procunier
himself drafted.
I don't know what existed at the state

at the

prison level but there may well have been negligent misin­
terpretation of things there.
Their refusal to send the packet. of draft 'writs
of habeas corpus in December of 1971 after the prison lav/
project may well have been a negligent misunderstanding by
the mail room dark as to hi's duties in the matter.
QUESTION:

Isn't part of your problem here an

erforfc to plard a 1983 complaint out of a personal injury
form book, really?
MR. ADAMS i

tainly, no personal injury form book was used by me in
drafting this complaint.

It was an attempt to match the law

under 1983 with the facts of this case as I understood them.

would not implicate Section 1983.

I need to find out.

At this

This is simply

another reason why we have an insufficient record to, in my
view, for the Court to make a determination.
You know, V73 are not talking about a concept that
can either be plugged into 1983 or taken out of 1983 whole
cloth.

We are talking about a concept of reasonableness in

relation to risk of harm to others that is already inter­
woven with the decisions of this Court, particularly the
qualified immunity decisions, that depends on the meaning of
particular amendments and I would point out to Your Honors
that a decision in favor of Respondent’s position here does
not open any

Pandora’s Box for a greater volume of cases

because we are talking about a decision similar in relation
to the First Amendment.
QUESTION;

Well, I thought, Counsel, that the

Court, in narrowing the question as.it did, it was trying to
pass on what -the Ninth Circuit's opinion said his allegations,
your client -5 allegations —that state officers negligently
deprived him of those rights state a 1983 cause action and
that that it* Aae only is^ue in the case, not tvhat kinds of

But whether

negligence — the question here is whether negligence is
ever covered under any circumstances by 1983, at least under
the narrow, limited question undar which the review was

R8
granted.
MR. ADAMS:

Yes.

And my answer, in brief, to

that, Your Honor, would be that there is no bar within the
intrinsic meaning of the First Amendment to negligence such
as there is in the Eighth Amendment.

Intrinsically, that

calls for a deliberate indifference standard.
The 14th Amendment, Equal Protection, for example,
I would agree with Counsel that this Court has found a
requirement of intent on the part of the acting state offi­
cials intrinsic in that particular constitutional guarantee.
However, when we look at the First Amendment —

QUESTION:

MR

The
ADAMS:

It uses the word "shall," which is a
14th Amendment uses the word "shall."
Yes, and that, language of the 14th

Amendment, you know, is consistent with the decisions of
this Court and supports a meaning of intent.
No : all constitutional guarantees are framed in
'terms of the state of mind of the acting state official and
the First Amendment is one of those that does not.

If Your

Honors would consider cases like Edwards v. South Carolina
and Finer v. New York, cases that involve, you know, police
conduct with situations that are unruly, possibly involve
disturbing of the peace.

We have a speaker or some marchers

exercising First Amendment rights.
T‘:ic, question about whether First. Amendment rights

were involved there or not does not turn on the state of mind
of the police official.

It does not turn on whether he was

exercising the utmost diligence in protecting their rights
or whether ha was a little bit reckless or negligent or what­
ever you might say in regard to those rights.
It does not. turn on that* but rather, the inde­
pendent examination by this Court of the record so we are not
talking about an intent obstacle in the First Amendment.

That is

is in the nature of a law abridging the freedom of expression
as applied to voux client

whereas when a truck goes off the

road, it is not even arguably law abridging anybody's free­
doms of expression.
Is that the distinction you were seeking to draw?
ME

ADK43;

Yes, Your Honor, I would be in agree­

ment with thau and I seek to provide a comprehensive oppor­
tunity for my client to prove import, that in one way or
another, in the intentional -- whether through the deliberate
drafting of the law or whether through a negligent follow-up
in the preparation of those regulations, be that a follow-up
on the part of the supervisory defendants in failing to train
or supervise or get feed-back from the defendants on the line,
so to speak, in terms of mail evaluation or negligence in
terms of the defendants on the line in terms of trying, with
some modicum of prudence and diligence, to be consistent, you
know, to follow what would at least be a reasonable meaning
of those regulations, then those rights have been violated.

There are a few other points that I would like to
briefly advert to that az’ose in the questions of the peti­
tioning attorney»
First of ail, briefly, in relation to the right
of access, X say at length in

footnote two, page three of

my brief, why I now press it even though I did, now, in re­
trospect, inadvisedly concede the right of access in written
argument, both before the District Court and the Court of
Appeals.
In terms of the coverage, the constitutional
coverage of the conduct here involved, the sending and
receiving of •— "wall, the sending of mail — the First Amend­
ment free expression, as I see it, is completely coterminus
with the right of access»
The distinction, then, the materiality of the
right of acceis has to do only with the history of the devel­
opment of these rights; the right of access is an older right
and has a longer history to it.
That distinction, in my view, became more material
when Wood y. Strickland was decided because I talked about
subtle constitutional rights and I think there is

well,

there is — if this Court were to take Petitioner's view
that only a decision by this Court itself

were to establish

a right to ba settled within the meaning of Wood

v. Strick­

land..» then, obviously, X am out in the cold as far as free

1-12

expression goes because, although, as X have argued in my
brief, there were some District Court decisions that, in my
view, reasonably and very clearly let Defendant Procunisr
know, he being party i:i a couple of those suits and as well
as some of the other defendants knew that there was prisoner
free expression already, reasonably in advance of 1971-1972,
there is no decision by the Court until Martinez y. Procunier,
where there was the beginning of acknowledgement of that
right and in bell v, Procunier very shortly thereafter where
ifc was made ax,press that, indeed, prisoners have a certain
measure of First Amendment free expression.
In terms of right of access, Johnson v. Avery was
decided much earlier and that could have been a foundation
for

at least that right so indeed, candidly, I made the con­

cession before,
If the Court wants to deal with the question that,
really, I think is not properly before this Court as a matter
of the question on which cart was granted — but if the
Court should wish to deal with it, I would suggest that it
might be in the interest of making a decision that gives good
guidance to the Circuit Courts and the lower Federal Courts
that will be reading this decision to look at all the rights
that the facts fairly raise and 1 think that the facts do
fairly raise right of access as well as free expression.
There is another question that may be in the minds

of this Court in relation to the .allowing of negligence that
I would like to address myself to briefly and that is whether
the relief that might he available in state court is not
really sufficient for the kind of harm that we are speaking
of here and I would suggest to Your Honors that it is really
not, that we need a federal forum, the forum of 1983 and a
federal perspective in order to properly grant compensatory
relief because we are talking about different interests, not
just common law interests, you know, injury to person, injury
to property*
We are talking about constitutional interests and
as Justice Harlan said very eloquently in. his concurring opin­
ion in Monroe v. Pape, those interests are fundamentally
different in character and often would call for a different
measure of damages in order to provide compensation.
For example, in the Troy v. Dulles case 356 U.S.
involving a decision by this Court that the Eighth Amendment
was violated Ly the denationalisation of an individual .
There was nc physical mistreatment but yet the
total destruction of an individual's status in organized
society violated that constitutional right.
There would have been no damages at common law.
And what about the right of an individual to, vote
or to attend an integrated school?
money damages there?

What are the common law

And what about Mr. Navarette right hare?

Common law perspective, handful of mail — what is it worth?
But when we look at it from a constitutional per­
spective, we are talking about this man’s effort to communi­
cate with the world outside hira and that has a certain value
in terms of the rehabilitation of this man.
QUESTION:

When a person

Conceding all that, again, I thought

the issue before the Court was whether negligence producing
that consequence is covered by 1983.
MR

ADAMS:

Yes, Your Honor and although this has

not been squarely decided by this Court, I would submit that
if the Court would — it would be a logical and plausible
extension from the immunity decisions that this Court has
made that negligence should lie.
The: Court has looked in the past in Wood, y, Strick­
land and Scheuer v. Rhodes to the common law for a guidance
and if we look here to the common law, we wi11 find that
state officials — that public officials are subject to
negligence liability where their acts are ministerial in
character arid not the act of exercise of discretion and all
1 am asking for here -QUESTION:

liable in the state courts is what you

mean, do you?
MR. ADAMS:
•QUESTION:
or liable under 1933?

What does that mean, now?
Do. you mean liable in the state courts

MR
courts.

ADAMS:

That would be: a liability in the state

That is the way the common law resolves the problem.

And while that is not something that should be followed as an
automatic matter in dealing with 1983, there being a greater
interest in attaching liability because the purpose, alter
all, of 1983 :.s to provide relief for the infliction of
constitutional harm by state officials.
We should at least go as far as the common law
goes and on that basis, I would urge the negligence to be
allowed.
Thank you.

We filed our writ from that ruling.
Now, the Ninth Circuit construed that the third

cause of action was the state of cause of action in negli­
gence.

If this Court or a majority of this Court reads it as

stating some other cause of action as habitual misreading of
statutes and regulations reads to us, deliberate indifference,
then he does not need a negligence cause of action and the

cause of action, was misreading what this compliant was all
about,
But the Court, I think, should go further and un­
equivocally hold that if it does, indeed, allege negligence
because he must mean negligence here.

He said "deliberate

indifference" in his first two causes of action — then we
decide that under no circumstances does negligence state a
cause of action and I think that this Court'd decisions,
particularly Estelle versus Gamble, Paul versus Davis, Riggo
versus Goode, support the proposition that negligence does
not state a cause of action under 1983.
The pattern of error by subordinate officials has
to be something more than negligence.

It has got to be so

egregious, widespread and continuing as to permit an infer­
ence of deliberate indifference and we read deliberate in­
difference to mean some sort of infirmative intentional

conduct or a refusal to act. upon, a clear duty»
Now, I want to clear up the point about whether
there are 13 items or 25 items that Justice Powell raised.
The complaint lists 13 items of mail, Justice
Powell.

It is true that some of those apparently have multi­

ple addressees and I think one of the items was reproduced
eight times arid put in eight different envelopes and sent
and when it was turned it, there were a package of eight
alleged but that is one item of eight.
So if you add up the multiples, it comes up to 25
letters in Perpendent'3 parlance but we accept his listing
of 13 items.

There we re 13 letters, as we see it.

them had multiple copies.

Some of

That clears that up.

Now, I have a fairness question that 3 have
difficulty in dealing with.
Counsel seems to say that Mr. Procunier, the
director off the California Department of Corrections, should
have known about the inmate's First Amendment, right of free
expression bad: in 1971 and 1972 because he was in court, in
the lower court — district court and circuit court -— liti­
gating the question but Mr. Procunier was here in 1974 and
this Court clic' not tell him anything

about an inmate's right

of free expression and I have a — there is a basic unfairnes
in coming and telling him now, "You should have known it in
1972'

when he was not told about it in 1974 and I submit it

on that.
Thank you, Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
