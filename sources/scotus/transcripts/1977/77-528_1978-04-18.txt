ORAL ARGUMENT OF

JOSEPH A. MARINO, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MARINOs

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr-» Chief Justice and may it pleas© the Courts
y

\.i

In this case the FCC has brought this case to you
for review from a judgment of the court below, an opinion in
which the court split in their opinion, with Justice L©venthal
dissenting, in the hop© of getting some clarification to the
meaning of the word "indeceat” as it appears in the Criminal
Cod©, 1464.
The) FCC has, from, beginning in 1970, triad to give
some concrete meaning to th© statute.

The FCC recognized in

the very first decision in 1970 that its opinion would of course
ba subject to th© judicial review, and it welcomed judicial
review.
This case cam© to th® FCC on a specific compliant
from a citizen in New York. The case, as it now is before the
Court, really raises two issues.

Th© first question ©f statutory

4
construction is whether ©r not the "indecent" as that word
appears in 1464 should be subsumed into the "obscene"# as it
has b®@n in several other federal cases„
On this issue,, both th© FCC and fee Department of
Justice are in agreement# arid# in their brief before you# argue
feat it should not b@0

The Department of Justice# in feeir

brief# makes a very literal statutory analysis of fee provision
r

of 14640

It points out feat the language# th® clear language

feat Congress used# is "any obscene# indecent# or profane”#
i

that this language was used

in a disjunctive# that Congress

was obviously trying to reach ©v©& fee us© ©f on© word which
was either 53indecent# obscmm# or profane"# although w© quickly
add feat fee case w© have before you deals not with obscenity
but wife indecency „
And if I could just back up and focus on fee complaint
that fee Commission had before it# that complaint was filed by a
listener in New York, a specific complaint which identified
four words.

Thor© "words would be defined as verbal taboos#

and in fact Professor Hayak&wa in his textbook on Languages
In Thought and Action# identifies them as verbal 'taboos and
says feat this usually deals wife words having something to
do wife sexual or excretory organs 6
The words amount# as on® judge has described them# as
verbal slaps»
So this specific complaint cam® to the Commission

5
It cam© to the Commis8ism at a time shortly after this Court's
opinion in Miliege

It cam© to th© Commission shortly after th©

Do Co Circuit had affirmed its opinion in th© Illinois Citizens
com®

dealing with th© question of obscenity , and had recognized

teat the presence of children in the audience was & vital
factor»

And this really was at th© heart of th® Commission's

decision, it was at th© heart of th© complaint teat th©
Commission had before it,
Th© listener pointed out that te@ words were broadcast
at a fc±m® in th© afternoon when a child could have been tuning
th><@ dial -and would have come across those words» The listener
pointed out that in fact h© had a child with him in the car»
And this really was, we think, at th© heart of th©
Commission's decision, when it cam® to th© concept of indecency»
Tli© Cemraissioa, as th© Justice Department correctly
recognizes and points out, took Element D of th® Miller case,
"patently offensive", tried to give flash to that element in a
cas© where you are merely dealing with words, individual words»
And what it said is that:

what we are dealing with when we

construe the indecent is words which ar© patently offensive
by contemporary community standards for the broadcast madia,
which deal with sexual and excretory organs, which are broadcast
at a time ©f the day when tear© is a reasonable risk teat children
may b© in th© audience»
And this is where tee Commission took a new tack, w©

6
believe# i and 1 think Judge Leventhal recognized this# with
regard to Mi© indecency standard.

It tried to channel these

words out ©f time periods when there would b© a reasonable
risk of children being in Ms® audience.
The css© was appealed to th@ D,C, Circuit# which
split.
We in our brief have called to your attention the
opinion of Judge Levehthal,

Ws think that

that opinion

correctly construes the Commission's order as a narrow order#
a declaratory order limited too the facts that the Commission
had before it# that the complainant had brought to the
Commission,

That th® ord@.r was presented to th© court as a

flat ban on thesu words# that these words could not be
broadcast at any — really at different times of th© day? but
that the only — that when it rules on the complaint itself
the Commission narrowed its holding to th© facts that it had
hafore it# and that it tried to accomplish two things with a
declaratory order.
It tried to furnish a concrete definition of th©
word "Indecency" and we must bear in mind that the Justice
Department has told the Court that th® Commission could have
read Mi® indecent prohibition in the criminal statute as a
flat ban.

The Commission did not do so.

It then proceeded

to analyse th© complaint and the conflicting int®r@sts and
competing interests that were at stake here,

And central to

?
those interests, Your Honor, was the recognition that this
Court made in the Yoder cas®, that th© parental interest in
the upbringing of children is an important value.
That opinion th® Commission found very helpful bec&us©
of file fact that in Yoder this Court not only relied on that
interest but also relied on the Ginsberg ©pinion, where Mr.
Justice Brennan had recognised a similar interest.
Th® Yod@r opinion was also instructive b@eaus® it
relied on, at least CP, th© Rowan case in which this Court
r@cogn.ised that in certain cirauras tances people &r© captive
in their own homes, -and that at that point they are entitled
to privacy interests.
How, th© Commission's opinion really at th© heart of
the case was th© attempt to protect children from these words.
Th© Commission also tried to give some recognition to privacy
rights of people in their home who would tune la to a station
and b© confronted with these words.
W© would point out that in a CBS vsa DSC cas®, this
Court recognized that a radio listener is, in many ways, a
member of a captive audience.

And I think we have mad© our

point®, Your Honor? if there are no further questions I would
save some time for rebuttal, and will b© very happy to answer

any questions.
QUESTION:

You referred to sens work of now Senator

Hayakawa, but it is not cited in your brief.

8
MR» MARINO:

I apologia©, Your Honor, that the taxt *—

QUESTION s Do you have the citation for it?
MR® MARINO;

It is his text. Professor Hayakawa*s

text on Language in Thought and Action»

There are two editions,

or at least I know of two editions, th@ 1349 Edition is very
interesting because it recognises not only the verbal taboos

that are before you dealing with sexual or excretory organs,
but. go®® on to point out that at least at that time in broad­
casting there were many more taboos that mad® it very hard for
people to communicate.»

But in the * 70 Edition h© drops the

reference to special taboos applicable to radio, and then
identifies the ones that w© think are before you»
If there are a© further questions —
QUESTION §
MR. MARINO:
QUESTION s

I d© have a question»
Y@s, Your Honor®

*

I tak© it the Commission's position is

that these words ar© indecent but not obscene?
MR® MARINOs

Yes, Your Honor®

QUESTION s De©s that mean that ifthis particular record
\

i

or these particular words asm sent over, say, a CB radio
transmission from an automobile to another automobile or
something like that, would the person playing the record or
saying th© words commit a crime?
MR® MARINOs

Your Honor, the Commission's definition

and this declaratory order addressed the broadcast medium,

3

which is different from the CB •»QUESTION:

I understand fehafc,

I was just: wondering

what th© Commission1s view is ©a whether that would be a crime
if these words, th© same record were played at the same time of
day over a CB transmission.

The statute would seem to apply

to it, would ife aot?
MRa K&RXNO:

Your Honor, we have a problem her®.

The Department of Justice looks at that statute with criminal
enforcement in mind, th© Commission locks at th® statute with
civil enforcement in mind, and with an attempt to channel,
I think that ones th© Commission has adopted this concept for
channeling, at least in broadcasting, it really has to b@ an
egregious case before a it would rise to th© point of —
QUESTION:

My question is:

under your construction

of til® statute, would playing this record and saying th its© words*
over a CB at ter© o’clock in th® afternoon constitute a. crime?
MR, MARINO:

Your Honor, I think that if we are

looking at this as a criminal statute and act —
QUESTIONs

Ife is & criminal statute, isn’t ife?

There

is no statute except a criminal statute.
MR, MARINO s

We think that ife would violate the

Commission’s construction of th® statute, yes.
QUESTIONS

Then let me ask you again?

Now, whether —
would it

constitute a crime in th® opinion of the Federal Communications
Commission?

Or do 'you have a position

ok

that?

10

MR* MARINO:

I don't teihk w© hav® & position on that.

Your Honor, and I think that *—
QUESTION s

D© you take the view that th® statute can

— th©*sama words in t$»e same statute can ia®an different things
in differant proceedings?
MR® MARINO3

If on® is — if it1a for purposes of

regulatory action in on® css® and channeling thm words into &
different tin» period, and in another case

really it's th® —

tee reason why I hesitate ©a thm crime, is because that's
really & question teat we would defer to the Justice Department.
If w brought a complaint to them ®nd thay said this doesn't
constitute wi of fens®, teat would be the ®ad ©f it*
QUESTIONs

Well, d@ you have any direct criminal

enforcement auteor.it/?
MR® MARINOs
QUESTION s
MR® MARINOs

No®
Can you bring a criminal proceeding?
No, w© aaaJfc® w© have to referit to

fch© Attorney General*
QUESTI®:

Right®

Now, going to fch© question about

tew CB, are th® CB people licensed in some way that teey can
get a limns® ©f some sort?
MR® MARINOs

They do, Your Honor®

QUESTION: Would not tea Commission at least have,
arguably, some other remedy against th© holder of a license,
by cancelling his license?

11
MR» MARINO;

Y©s, Your lienor. We have adminia trstiv@

and regulatory actions .
QUESTION ;

Just as you d© with a broadcast license,

at th© @nd of hie —* when h© cam® up for renewal, this kind of
conduct would certainly b© a factor to b© considarad in th®
renewal of th© 1leans© , would ifc not?
MRa MftRXNO:
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.
Well, Mr. Marino, doesn't th© Commission

consider any number of factors at th© time ©f license renewal
that very like 1- th® govommant couldn't prosecute a station
for criminally?
MR. MARINO;

Yes , Your Honor.

Undor th® public

interest standard it would have to b® «— one violation might
not arise to Ifc® level ©f justifying some action at renewal j
bu«S, yes, it would.
QUESTIONs Well, why doesn’t th© Commission justify
this particular rule under the public interest standard, as a
definition of th® public interest standard?
MR. MARINO:

Your Honor, th© Commission has been

given at least ««• there are at. least three sections in th®
Communications Act, in which Congress has asked th® Commission
te enforce 1464 by administrative action.

And it feels 'that in

a situation where. w© are reaching a typ®, at l@ast words, that
sine® there was- th® prohibition, the indecency prohibition, that
was th® way to try to giv® it soma concrete meaning.

12
la response to Justice Stevens* question* w® d© r©fer
eases to th© Justin Department for prosecution of CB operators,
©ad I think that's really th* only «— that's the ©aly area that

I knew ©£ in which th@r® have boon any recent convictions for
violating 1464»

1 think there ware two eases arising in,the

Seventh Circuit in which I know you wer® on those panels#

where those prosecutions were appealed.
QUESTION:

Nell/ we'll b® interested in Mr»

Claiborne's response to Justice Stevens* question»
QUESTION:

Could I ask you,, I'm still not completely

clear ©a whether the Commission takes th© position that the
©am© statutory seating can have a different —» th© same
statutory words can have a different meaning in a civil
proceeding for cancellation ©r whatever it might be, than it
has in a criminal proceeding»
In other words, can th® word

indecent" h?v© a broader

meaning in on® proceeding than it has in another when it's in
the same statute?
MR» MARINO:

As Jusfeic© Stevens has pointed out,

w© have not oily the indecency prohibition here, —
QUESTIONs

Well, I midarste&d, you havs th® public

interest theory»

4
MR» MARINO:
question:

«•« we have the public interest»
Well, to the extant that you rely on the

criminal statute, do you say that word has different meaning

13
depending on the kind of proceeding that, is brought, to ©afore©
that statute?
MR® MARINO:

I gu@ss we rely on mor® than th© criminal

statute# \m roly ca tha criminal *•«>
QUESTION t But; to th© extent that you rely on that
statute, do you contend that th® a suns word has two different
meanings? depending on th© natur® of th® proceeding that is
brought?
MR® MARINO i
wrote th© word#

I don't think we? could# because Congress

and all wo'r© trying to do# Your Honor#

is give semes limiting construction to it®
QUESTION; But you’re: not confined to that statute on
a renewal of a license, are you?

By any. Kui&ns.

Mr. Plotkin.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY M» PLOTKIN, ESQ»,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT PACIFICA FOUNDATION
MR. PLOTKIN:

Chief Justice and may it pleas®

th® Court:
I would like to placa this case just a little bit into
proper perspective, a© that w© will knew what we ar® talking

4
about, because we ara talking about a criminal statute»
This case, v®ry briefly, involves a program on a non­
commercial educational station in New York, with a limited

16
nudienc® t which was a discussion program that was involved on
tills particular day

it's a regular program, and on this

particular day the program was devoted to discussion of
contemporary

attitudes with respect to language.

QUESTIONS
station.

I didn’t get your characterisation of this

What kind of & station?
MR. PLOTKINs

station.

It’s a. noncommercial educational

That means it’s a station licensed to a nonprofit

organisation, none of whose

activities can be — there can b©

no commercials on it, and its programs ar® of an educational
nature.

It's like WETA here in Washington; th® is» am® type ©f

station.
QUESTIONS

Almost!

[Laughter. ]
MR. PLOTKIN:
das crib© them &a a

If it’s a little hyperbole, I would
(?)

rather than a function, I think.

Buff, in any ©vent, this was a discussion program, and
that day the discussion was devoted to contemporary language,
and as part of 12$® program the moderator took questions,
answered questions, and then played this 12-minute segment of
a record by Georg© Carlin, called 51 Occupations
th® particular selection was "Filthy Words'.

Poole", and
And it’s & 12-

4
minute dialogue.
Before the dialogue was put ©a, Idler® was an annouc©m©nt teat a ora© of the words on this program may b@ of a delicate

17

and offensive nature, and thoss who mights b® offended by it;
mights tuno out for 15 minutes, and com© bade again, to the
program»
QUESTION; Do you think thats leads young poop 1© to
turn ©££ tha program?

. Or is that an attempt —

MR» PLOTKIN2
QUESTION t

No,

it might ba a —

la that intended to he & coms-cn, to b©

sure that teey will listen?
MR» PLOTKIN;

It's awfully h&rd to know, both in

advertising and in general, you know, this typ® might b®
invitational rather ‘than th© contrary»

I 'tehisik ©a this typ®

ef station it is not, because this is not th© typ© of station
that’s devoted fe© commercial enterprises, this was not a
(?)

program, it’s not a titillating program, it's &

station which does devote itself to th® unusual programs, to
highly

controversial programs, to a wide variety of programming»

And while on other stations this typ® ©f ad might b® a. coma-on,

on tills typ© of station I don’t think this is th© intention,
but I don’t think w® ex® dealing with subjective matters, I
think we are dealing with objective ones.
QUESTION s

But of course th® child teat happens to

tune in knows what kind of station it is?
MR» PLOTKINs

Oh, yaa»

Yes»

Th© child was sitting

with hie father, and presumably -QUESTIONz

No, I say th© average child knows that this

18

ia an educational station which has a broad rang® of programs
— how in the world could a child know that?
MR» PLOTKIN:
QUESTION*
MR» PLOTKI'Ns

How could h© know it*s educational?
Y@So
Well , this particular chi Id, w© know

very little about him, w® only know about his father who sent
in the complaint»
But, in any ©vent, h® s@nds la a complaint and
Pacifica Foundation answered that this was the work of a
social satirist, and that this was intended to have a discussion
of the who Its «subject»
The FCC then adopted, a memorandum ©pinion and order»
They adopted a memorandum ©pinion and order as part, of an
over-all proceeding, where til© Commission, in response to
complaints from Congress and pressure from ether groups, was
addressing several different subjectss

violence, sex-related

programs, and ©becans and indecent language»
And, very interestingly, they talked at great length
about violence in programs, and they sra talking about tele­
vision as well as radio» They are talking about violent
programs, they are talking about sexually oriented programs,
and very interestingly the Commission says that while there
may be social har» attributable to so» of these things, that
there’s nothing we can do about it, because this is a very
delicate area of the First Amendment, send therefore this is th©

19
sorti of tiling w® l©av© to the station’s good judgment, to
their editorial discretion and judgment*.»
But when it comas to obscenity or indecency, it
eaya it1® a different subject# because 'her® w@ have a statute,
a specific criminal statute# 18 0»S»C» 1464, and this statute
says w© can do something about obscenity, indecency or profanity,
t

that you can’t do with respect to violeae® ©r s@x--orienfed
material»
Mid it's important to look at the statute, because
the statute does — it’s not part of the Communications Act, but
it does forbid the utterance of indecent, obscene or profan®
language over radio, whether it’s radio, television, CB, any
©ti»@r type of radio communication»
specific authority to enforce it

And th® Commission is given
either by revoking a license,

by issuing a c@as® and desist order, or by levying a fin,®»
Here they didn’t do any of those three tilings.

Here they

issued a general declaration, which says teats

We find that

these type of words, particularly when children are likely to
b@ in the audience, tire indecent because they refer in a
patently offensive manner to sexual or excretory activities,
or organs, and teat therefor® they should b® banned during
that —* they should be banned during teat period»

And that

they cannot be redeemed by context, even though they have
literary, artistic or scientific value, they are banned, per se»
They did go ©n to say «»

or artistic value?

Even

Commissioner Robinson* whs concurred in the case* ©a a very

and decide that it did h&v® ito But h@ agreed with th®

Pardon?

If test ia artistic* deliver m®»

MRo PLOTKINt Wall* I think th® use. ©f words is a very
^

difficult matter* and obviously some people us® words in some
connection* other people us® them in other connections»
I do want to address myself to the statute* because
we ar© talking about a criminal statute.

And this Court has

21
previously held, when the Comraissionbas attempted to adopt;
rul@s and regulations relating to a lottery, which also was a
criminal statute wher© the Commission had th© saims authority,
this Court, in the F,^daral,jCffl.mm^cfifei©na Coiraai3sion_vi>_.ABC,

which is at 35? U.S0, specifically held that the Commission
cannot interpret the words of a criminal statute when applying
it in its regulatory aspect any differently than a court would»
And this Court specifically overturned rules and regulations of
the Commission which attempted to define consideration for

the purpose of a lottery as being different from what it was in
the criminal law.
Here we have a statute that uses "obscene, indecent,
©r profan®", exactly th® smm type of words that ar© used in
18' OoS.C, 1461, which has been before this Court in the
H&mling case, and this Court has specifically held that, as a

matter of statutory construction, that when those words ar®
used, the words "Indecent, filthy, vile and obscene* mu$t mean
th® same m "obscene" in order to satisfy the dual test of
avoiding vagueness under fee due process clause, and feus, as

a whole, appeal to prurient interest and must be without
any literary, artistic, social or scientific value»

preoQC&ssor h©ra, since you wrote th© ©pinion# Your Honor»
But to say —
QUESTION:

You get my problem?

MRo PLCTKIN:

Y@s3

But to say w© now s© coastal®

it as to avoid te® problem»

I think that® e th® strongest

l-anguag® to a third person

1b possible to sayffl

I’m not

saying that no other conclusion was possible# but the language
was very strong that in order to say te® statute was so
construed —»
QUESTION3 W©11# there's a© doubt that th® words are
their© in the ©pinions, I think might quibble# and the thing is
for you to describe it as a holding# sins© a holding is
presumably the application of the law to tee particular sat of
facts before th® Court®
MR» PLOTKINj

Yeso

Well, I think that's righto

And technically that was 1461 there and this is 1464»
th© words in th© statute are the same»
868©»

But

Th© meaning was th®

w© have a Firut Amendment medium here just as wa do there#

and it seems to me teat not only do w® have © First Amendment
tedium under th® First Amendment# but Section 326 of th©
Communications Act specifically says teat th® Commission shall
have a© power ©f censorship»
New, this is an entirely differentthing from th® fair-

23
mum doctrine# or lack of balance# where# becaus© this Is a
medium where ©carcitf is a factor#. th@ Court has said that
in order to raak® sura that fee medium

was mad© available to a

maximum number of people w® will impose certain duties upon
broadcast stations to make star® that all can us® it*
Bute teh«?,fe?s an entirely different thing from fe®
government craning in and saying that you are forbidden to do
something? and in the Bed Li on case# which Mr» Justice Whit©
authored# you mad© that vary point# that where there’s a 'fairness' . doctrine and -the personal attack doctrine might
b® sustained# because it's expanding the medium# it had real
chaos# an entirely different question would be presented, if
fee government her® were trying to suppress speech#

. and

feat's exactly what they are doing hers# they are trying to
suppress speech»

And if they arcs trying to suppress speech#

they must be asked to pass fee same test here as they do in any
ether First Amendment meaning.

The fact feat this is radio

does not make a, difference,
QUESTION; Well now# you say the question was reserved
in ted Lien# as it certainly was# that doesn’t necessarily mean
feat is fee case of regulated airwaves they have tea pass fee
same test© as feey would if feey sought tea impos® this test
on a newspaper# do«s it?
MR. PLOTKIMs
Honor.

I think 326 dees mean feat, Your

I think — normally fee First Amendment# I think Congressi

24
was saying tfc&fc in Section 326, when it says 19the Commission
shall have no power of censorship,”

When it. comes to

suppression, I think the same test is applicable to radio and
television as is applicable to a newspaper,
QUESTIONi Well, then you say literally the FCC can
never -tell any station that it may not put out any particular
message?
MRo PLOTKIN;

I say that they cannot tail a radio ©r

television station,that they cannot suppress what a radio or
television station can do ©ny more than they can any other —
QUESTION ;

You mean like ads?

MR, PLOTKIN s

I think that now that ads have a

certain ©mount, & penumbra of First Amendment protections, I
think radio and television ads would have the same protection
as newspaper ads,
QUESTIONS

This is because of 326?

MRo PLOTKINI

I think because of 326 and probably

because ©f the First Amendment? I think ~QUESTIONS

Well, do you have to reach that if you*re

right under 326?
MR, PLOTKIN;

Mr, Justice Tamm in th® Court below

did not reach it constitutionally, he reached 326,
can b© decided on 326,
mssnfc overtones,

I think it

I’m not *»- I think 326 has First. Amend-

Bart I don't think it*E necessary to do it,

because 1 think Congress has said that a© far as the Commission

25

was cone®mad, when, its comes to the area of suppression, they
cannot; suppress this any more than .say other medium

can bo

suppressed,
'

QUESTION g Well, supposing under you?» definition of
censorship that a station just decided that for an hour it
would put on a record consisting ©f

otm

four-letter word

repeated over and over again for the hour, no one would make any
clnim that it had any cohcirant m^sss&g®, it was because th©
p@rs©n spinning th© platter simply liked it that way»

Und@r

your definition would the PCC be powerless because of the
censorship statute to effect that?
MR» PLQTKINs
)

them to stop doing it»

I think it would b® powerless to tell
I would have th® same problem in

response to your hypothetical question if the station did
nothing, say, but play wTh® Music Goes 'Round and
day»

* Round" all

It is not because ©f the content but because a station is

required to operate la the public interest. And if they — on®
of til© doctrines that the Commission has announced in th© past
was '&®t if you don't have a well"*rounded program and if you
devote too much of your programming to ©no aspect and neglect
other parts of your programming, you’re not operating in th©
j

public interest»
But not because th© particular words ar© bad, not
because particular words have a particular taboo»

Her® the

Commission W£as saying that just becaus© you use these seven

2S
words t not matter in what context.* if you put on a show wheaxs
people car* call in and discuss a live subject* a controversial
issue, and if sow© e£ th© people cam® from the kind ©£ culture
that uses thus® kinds ©£ wards as part of their discussion,
particularly In anger and heat, th® Commission would say that
if you did that in the afternoon that this would be a violation
©f th® criminal code so far as? th© Commission can see it, and
it. would also be ground for revoking their license„
I don’ t think th© Commission has that authority.
QUESTION s Can you justify the coexistence ©£ 1464 and
326?
MRo PLOTKIN%
QUESTION:

Y®s, I can —

How?

MR. PLOTKIN:

— to the sans extent that I can

justify the coexistence of 1451 and the First Amendment,
/

If

,

it's given th® same interpretation, this Court has held —
and 1464 is no different than 1461

if it is constitutional

for a statute to say that obscene material cannot be —»
QUESTION:

Well, I’m .getting away from the Cenatitu-

ti@n, I’m speaking of just on the statute, because —
MR. PLOTKIN;
QUESTION:

Yes,

Yea, I don’t think 326 —

— you've taken th© position just now

that 326 was the entire censorship statute, and meant what it
8 aid.
MR, PLOTKIN;

Yes.

Yes.

27

-

QUESTION: And what: posture then is left to 1464?
MR. PLOTKIN:

1 think 326 has to be read in the sam®

light as the First Amendma&t, when it says

no censorship,

it says no censor-ship of material that is constitutionally
protected»

I do not think that the Commission,, by 326, has

loss power than the government does, say, against a newspaper.
If they have obscene material, if you can prevent obscene
material under 1461.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

He'll resum® there at

ten ©'clock in to® morning.
[Whereupon, at 2:59 o'clock, p.m., the Court was
recessed, to reconvene at 10s00 a.m., Wednesday,
April 19, 1978.J
