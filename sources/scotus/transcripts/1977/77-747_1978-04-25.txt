ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE B. CHRISTENSEN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I had hoped that someday I would have the pleasure of
arguing an appeal and not have to confess an inadvertent typo­
graphical error in a brief.

In our i^eply brief we refer to the

New Jersey case, Raybestos-Manhattan v. Glaser, as being in
156 Atlantic 2d.

It should be 165 instead of Xp6.

annoyance if they work from our -!

MR, CHRISTENSEN:

It should be 165.

MR. CHRISTENSEN:
QUESTION:

That should be I65?

MR, CHRISTENSEN:

I still haven't got it right.

4
Now, 1 have, I hope.

. .

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE.BURGER:
it straightened out.

Well, between us we'll get

Very well.

MR. CHRISTENSEN:

The Court may recall that this is

sort of a companion case to the White Motor case you decided
recently, involving the Minnesota Pension Protection Act.
there decided that until ERISA

You

the subject of patent regu­

lation was not preempted by the federal labor laws.

And you

didn't touch any constitutional issues.
QUESTION:

You said "patent" regulation.

I think

you mean pension.
MR. CHRISTENSEN.:.. Oh, I've been listening too much
here this morning, I'm afraid.
Now, the same pension statute is before you in this
case that you had before you in the White Motor case.

And,

in substance, what Minnesota did, anticipating that ERISA
was coming on which eventually would preempt the field, it
passed this 10-year vesting provision that added to the sub­
stantive obligation of Allied Structural Steel's pension plan,
thereby conferring an unexpected windfall on employees.
did this retroactively.

It

In effect, gave a retroactive wage

increase because contributions to. a pension plan are a form of
compensation for the employee.

And, as we try to demonstrate

and think we do in our reply brief, in the face of no impor­
tance for vital public need that would authorize such an'

intrusion into private contracts.
We take the position that if it is »«* what was done
here is not impermissible, if it is upheld, then the Impairment
of Contracts Clause is virtually gone from the Constitution and
there would be no limit upon what states could do in important
business contracts, 'whether they be leases, insurance policies,
deeds, pension plans, or whatnot.

They could play havoc with

them and destroy the stability in private arrangements that the
Constitution is designed to procure.
You will find, as you go through the briefs,. Your
Honors, that New Jersey had a somewhat similar notion, a little
before Minnesota, and that's the Raybestos-Manhattan case that
we referred to.

There, they made a statute somewhat similar to

this imposing, in effect, vesting requirements much earlier than
the plan provided for.

And they limited it to employers of

500 persons or more.
New Jersey has a statute that -«* l'don#t know whether
it is common to many states — provides special legislation.
The New Jersey Superior Court struck the statute down as un>»
constitutional as special legislation under their New Jersey
statute and as denying equal protection of the laws under both
the State and the Federal Constitution.

And that has been

affirmed by an opinion that came out in late March or early
April — X forget which — which is yet unpublished but it
attached as an appendix to our reply brief.

6
The State of Minnesota, before Your Honor, doesn't
deny, as I read their brief, that this is a vital impairment
of the contract,

And you cannot imagine a much greater one.

In our case because we represent a smaller employer, there
appears to be about $150,000 of additional burden imposed.
You can't tell precisely the amount until actuarial computations
are made.
And in the White Motor case, where far more people
were involved, there was a difference of some $8 to $10 million
beyond the funds that White had committed itself or had re­
served to pay its terminated employees.
QUESTION:

I suppose In the strictly technical

sense, there isn't an impairment of contract, insofar as Allied
is concerned here, in the sense that a contractual expectation
that it had was taken away from it.

Very likely the sense of

the provision is involved, but don't you ordinarily think of
impairment of the obligation of a contract as thinking you had
a right to receive something under a contract and then the
state says, "No, you don't have a right to receive it"?
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

I think the term has been expanded

over the years by the courts, but there is a very definite ;lmpalrmenfc, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in the sense I believe you are
talking about.

Because Allied had a right to terminate this

pension plan, with no penalty.

And Minnesota said, in effect,

"You cannot terminate this plan, even though the contract gives

7
you an unlimited right so to do.

You cannot terminate it unless

you pay this ransom money into the state fund to buy annuities
for these people."
QUESTION:

Well, it imposes new obligations, is that

y ou r a rgumenfc?
MR. CHRISTENSEN:
gation,

Well, you can call it a new obli­

You can say depriving us of our right to terminate.

It is pretty much, Mr. Chief Justice, a matter of semantics.
But here was a plan which prescribed how it should be funded,
It was funded according to actuarial principles and. of course,
it assumed that not all of the employees would be present to
receive pensions.

They would either die, be discharged, quit,

any number of —
QUESTION:

Do you think the state — If a company had

no bargained for plan or no voluntary plan, do you think a
state statute could require the company to adopt a plan, a
statutory type plan?

Suppose in the statute they had a

forumula, a pattern, and they just required all companies to
\
\
start putting their money into these funds.
\
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

Well, that, Your Honor, I do not

think would Involve the obligation of the Contracts Clause.
It's more a question of due process.
QUESTION:
Security Act is?

Is that very far away from what the Social

Was that Mr. Justice White's suggestion?

MR. CHRISTENSEN:

Well, it's not too far away from it

8
but. Your Honor, your point now is addressed to the powers of
the Federal Government and it is not directed to destroying
or altering or changing a private contract.
QUESTION:

What you are suggesting is that the Federal

Government is not bound by the Impairments Clause the way the
states are.
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

That's correct.

And there is no

doubt about that, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Are you also suggesting that a state

could not have adopted what is essentially the Social Security
statute independent of federal action?
MR* CHRISTENSEN:
answer that question.

I don't know if I am prepared to

It would depend now when the Federal

Government got to ERISA, its second regulation of penseion
plans.

It moved quite carefully.

a five-year imp 1 orientation plan*

It brought the plan in under
It gave various options for

vesting or it permitted you to abandon a pension plan entirely
with no penalty.

It's a very complicated statute and I don't

mean to speak with great authority upon it.
Now, if you go to whether a state could have adopted
a Social Security plan,

I don't think I am prepared to answer

that.
QUESTION:

Mr, Christensen, if I understood your

argument, it would make a difference whether it was for the
future or the past, wouldn't it?

9
MR* CHRISTENSEN;

Oh, yes, certainly.

But you are

now talking about a thing unconnected with service, just at a
certain age they put in a tax.

If you follow Social Security,

a state would tax individuals and employers, in some prescribed
amount,to build retirement

payments at age 65, or with the

permission of this Court, now 70, whatever it may be.

That's

quite a different problem, Mr, Justice, than retroactively
saying to employees who have worked and who have received every
dime they were entitled to,, either in direct wages or in the
written promises of fringe benefits, such as this pension plan,
’’You will go back and pay more money to those people,!l by a
sort of retroactive vesting.
QUESTION:

Aren't there really two parts to the

retroactive aspect of this case?
question brought this to mind.

Mr. Justice Relinquish *s
On the one hand, you have to

put more money into the fund, and secondly you are prevented
from getting back that which you would have been able to re­
covers over and above the vested rights of those who are
entitled to some money.

I take it there would have been a

surplus, that under the contract you "would have had the right
to return.
MR, CHRISTENSEN;
beg to differ with you.

No.

On the second assumption, I

on behalf of Employee A, who died in the interim, stay in the

fund and help the fund provide money for Employee B. C, D» and
so forth.

It doesn't revert back to the employer.
QUESTION:

But if you terminate the plan --

MR. CHRISTENSEN?
QUESTION:

No. sir.

— you are asserting that -- In answer to

Mr. Justice Rehnqulst* you pointed out that the contractual
right to terminate the plan had been impaired.
MR. CHRISTENSEN:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

You could —

Well., how did that hurt you* if all the

money was in there to stay anyway?
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

Because Minnesota has imposed this

pension funding charge —

I understand the requirement that you put

But that is not- an

That's the creation of

a new obligation.
MR. CHRISTENSEN:
QUESTION:

Or it's a condition —

-And you:r answer to Mr, Justice Rehnquist

was that* "Well* they have destroyed"-- "They have impaired our
right to cancel the plan."
Now* how did that hurt you? No longer being able to
cancel the plan.

I thought that meant that you would have

gotten some money back.
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

I don't think a conditional right

to cancel -- I think they have destroyed the right to cancel.

11

You say they have created an additional obligation.

1 phrase

it and# again# you and I may be engaging in semantics# but
when I have an unqualified right to terminate a plan without
liability — and Minnesota says you can terminate that plan
only if you will pay more money -- 1 think they have destroyed
my unlimited right of termination.
QUESTION:

What you want is the right to terminate

without paying additional money.
QUESTION:

Did the state prevent you from

terminating the plan with respect to any. newly hired employees?
MR* CHRISTENSEN:

Well# no# that wouldn't arise#

Mr* Justice# because this Act goes into effect only when you
are closing a plan# so that the question of new employees
coming in can*t arise in Minnesota.
QUESTION:
another plan?

What about the employees transferee? to

Do you have to go on paying for them if you

don’t i^ant to?
MR0 CHRISTENSEN:

I'll have to go off the record

and my colleagues can -- They had such a thing hers# one of
these cases that they thought applied.

Employees were transfered

and Minnesota didn't levy its tax.
QUESTION:

I am sorry to interrupt.

QUESTION:

Well# it is clear that this Act requires

the employer to pay some money for an earlier period.
retroactive in that sense# isn't it?

It is

MR, CHRISTENSEN:
QUESTION:

Qh, very retroactive.

So that it is not just altering an

existing contract with respect to the future, you say?

It

requires a deposit of payment covering a period elapsed before
the statute was passed.
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

Oh* yes.

This plan had an elabor­

ate vesting schedule that was a combination of years of service
plus age.

And the Minnesota statute says.*

"You have got to

fund your plan so that ail contributions made at ten years are
vested."

They put in a ten-year vesting period.

stringently retroactive.

And it is

It *s the equivalent of giving these

employees a retroactive wage increase.
Now, Minnesota, or the District Court, makes some
point which we have endeavored to answer in our brief that
the employees anticipated they would get their pensions.

That,

with all due respect to the court below and my brethren here.,
is fanciful.

Employees

everyone goes on thinking he is

going to live forever, but every man knows in his heart that
he may not, and he buys an insurance policy. . Employees antici­
pate and have a right to anticipate pensions only in accordance
with the terms of their plan.
The doctrine created by the District Court here
which if permitted to stand, that if you can invade and change
contracts to make them work aa someone may have anticipated
they would work, would destroy contracts completely.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE, BURGER:

Mr. Starns,

ORAL ARGUMENT OP BYRON E. STARNS, ESQ..
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. STARNS: Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please the
Court:
First of all, the Minnesota Act applies in two situ­
ations, a planned termination by an employer and a plant clos­
ing,

This case involved the closing of a plant, not a planned

termination.

I think that point should be clarified.

QUESTION:

Is the plan being terminated because the

plant is closing?
MR* STARNS:
effect as of this date.

No, Your Honor, the plan is still in
It has been amended twice by the

company to freeze the benefit levels and to freeze the ability
of anyone to get into the plan in the future and the amounts
have been vested with respect to the people covered by the
plan prior to those amendments.
Our position. Your Honors, is that the heart of
Appellant's argument is that the situation addressed by the
Pension Act was the subject of a preenactment contract, and
that as applied to Allied the Act has changed those established

14

contractual rights.

To the contrary, our position is that there

is no established contract between Allied and its Minnesota
workers, with respect to their earned interest in the pension
benefits based upon the circumstance of a plant shutdown, and
further that the Act is not retroactive in effect, since no
preenactment established contractual rights are affected.
I think this can be illustrated by examining the
nature of the contractual relationship we are dealing with here.
The creation of a pension plan constitutes a unilateral offer
by the employer which is subject to the acceptance by the
employee.

And that acceptance is only complete when he has

satisfied both the length of service requirements and the
attainment of the minimum age requirement.

So that we have

no fully completed contract in the context of this case, since
we are dealing with people who have -QUESTION:

Mr. Starns, are you saying there has been

no impairment?
MR. STABNS:

ment, Your Honor.

to say that you, in effect, conceded there was impairment but
that it was justifiable.

Your Honor, I think I can clarify that

I think the District Court has said that the state seems

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BYRON E, STARNS3 ESQ.* (Resumed)
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR, STARNS:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please

the Court:
At the recess* the state was arguing about the con­
tractual relationship involved in this particular case.

I

thought that a brief recitation of the procedural history re­
lating to this point might be in order to help clarify our
position before the Court,
The challenge was brought by Allied Steel in District
Court to the application of the state statute here in question.
As a result of that action* the state ultimately filed a motion
for the Federal District Court to abstain in order that the
state courts could construe the null and void provision of the
Act* which is the final section of the Act.

At the same time*

there was a cross-motion for summary judgment brought by Allied
Steal.

In the context of that motion* we filed a brief in June

of 1976 which stated that to the .extent that the Act -- to the
extent that the pension plan allowed Allied to cause the for­
feiture of accrued benefits for those not qualified under the
plan, there might be impairment.

Of course* subsequent to that

17

brief «.'chare we a an argument before 'the District Court. The
•District Court denied both motions, certified instead of
abstaining on the question of interpretation of state law,
certified that to the Minnesota Supreme Court and appointed a
special master to find fact.

The special master found as a

finding of fact that the pension plan as originally adopted did
:*

not take into account a plant shutdown as one of the conditions
for the actuarial calculations associated with it.

Those

findings of fact were stipulated to by all the parties and
constitute findings of fact in this case.
In any event, we think that there is before the Court
the issue of whether or not there is impairment to this contract.
Now, the relevance of the impairment issue, of course, goes to
the reasonableness test under United States Trust and the ex­
tent of impairment.
Our point is that it is established that a pension
plan constitutes a unilateral offer by the employer to the
employee of a form of deferred compensation.

The law,is, and

the Appellants have admitted, that employer contributions con­
stitute a form of compensation,

However, the cases have held

that an employee is not entitled to receive that form of de­
ferred compensation, or any part thereof, unless he has satis­
fied the eligibility requirements of the plan.

And those eligi­

bility requirements are typically the attainment of a minimum
age and the service for a minimum period of time, whatever it

raighfc be under the particular plan,
Consequently, in such a situation* we submit* that
if there is no contract for the employees 5 benefit to enforce
in this situation* there can be none to be impaired by state
law*
QUESTION:
MR* STARNS:
QUESTION:

Was this a bargained for plan?
No* Your Honor* it was not,
You might not be able to make this argu­

ment in a bargained for plan?
MRa STARNS:

I think that argument might not be made

in that context.
The Act does not affect the subject of preenactment
bargaining* much less agreement* in our opinion.

And that takes

it out of the scope of retroactivity* in our opinion.
QUESTION:

When you say it doesn’t affect the subject

of preenactment -- Maybe not in this case* but doesn't the
statute apply to bargained contracts?
MR* & TARNS:

Yes.

I am only talking about this case*

Your Honor.
QUESTION;

What is your view as to its constitution­

ality as to bargaining contracts?
MR * STARES;
QUESTION:

I think it is constitutional.
You just say that it is not even an im­

pairment of contract here?
MR* STARNS:

Right*

I think that* of course* whether

or not there is an Impairment, whether or not the: "statute Is
retroactive under the decisions of this Court, a valid police
power enactment is constitutional.

And I think that for all the

reasons set forth in our brief this law would be constitutional
whether or not it applied to a collectively bargained or noncollectively bargained plan.

1 think the distinction between

the plans would relate to what the expectations of the parties
are.

And, of course, that's one of the factors that this Court

has identified to be analyzed in terms of determining the extent
of impairment.

And, of course, I think in examining expecta­

tions of the parties, the nature of the contractual relation­
ship is an important factor.

It may impact upon the breadth

with which the Court can go outside the document, itself.
QUESTION:

Mr. Starns, do you have any offhand, top-

of-the-head knowledge as to how many bargained for employees
would be covered by this and how many non-bargained for employees?
/

MR, STARNS:

Because of the enactment of the J&nployee

Retirement Income Security Act of 197^, the number of Minnesota
people is limited,

The vast majority are the subjects of col­

lectively bargained contracts.

The VIhit® case is 1200 people,

I believe,
QUESTION:

So, if we were to decide it just on the

basis that this was a non-bargained for pension plan, we would
leave undecided, I take it ~ if our decision applied only to
those facts — the vast majority of the people to whom the plan

20

applied,
MR* S TARNS :

Your Honor* 1 think the answer to that is

that might be the result of your decision.

MR, S TARNS :
QUESTION:

Yes* 1 will* Your Honor,
Bat also it is limited in the sense there

haven't been too many instances for you to apply the plan*
between the time it went into effect — the Act — between the
time it went into effect until the time it has bean preempted by
ERISA.
MR, S TARNS :

That 's correct.

Our Minnesota Supreme Court held that the Act was pre­
empted by ERISA effective January 1975'» or the plan years to
which ERISA applies,

However* T think that there may be appli­

cations in the future, depending upon what,the fact situation is.
I admit that they are limited and maybe

nonexistent* but there
I

.

conceivably could be soma application of the Act in the future.
QUESTION:
MR, S-TARNS :

To a bargained-for plan?
To a bargained-:?or and a nonbargained-

for plan.
Now,, the state’s position is also that the statute is

21

not retroactive in effect.

The express language of the pension

plan, itself, indicates that there was no meeting of the minds
on the plant shutdown situation.

For example, the length of

service for vesting under the pension plan is a lengthy period
of time, twenty years.

Secondly, there is an express covenant

not to compete in the plant.

It seems to us that this implies

that a person reading that document could anticipate that the
plan would continue in existence and the plant would continue
in operation for at least the minimum period of vesting, twenty
years, plus a lengthy period of time thereafter, since retirees
would forfeit their benefits if they engaged in any competition
with a company.

That presumes a continuing enterprise.

And we note that the court below took special notice
of the fact that the company-3® actuaries didn't take into account
the plant shutdown.

And Judge Haney noted at the argument on the

merits that, in light of that fact, there is a question as to
whether you really have an impairment of contract.
Now, the Act Is also not retroactive, In our opinion,
because it applies to transactions which are completed after
its date of enactment.

Generally, a law is retroactive, con­

sidered retroactive for constitutional purposes, if it reaches
back to alter already completed transactions.

Here the trigger­

ing event of the statute occurs after its effective date.
QUESTION:

To what point of constitutional law is

your retroactivity argument directed?

22
MR. STARNS:

That would be, essentially, a due process

argument, I think. Your Honor.
QUESTION:

There is no specific prohibition in the

Constitution against the enactment of retroactive law. is
there?
MR, STARNS:

No»

I think I am trying to address the

points raised by Appellants in their brief.
QUESTION:

Mr. Starns, may I ask, the only question

that is presented in the jurisdictional statement, even as re­
phrased in your brief, is the contract clause question.

Do we

have anything else to decide here?
MR, STARNS:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.
Well, isn't this discussion of due process,

police powers, isn't that rather irrelevant to the question
presented?
MR„ STARNS:
that way, Your Honor.

I think it is, if you construe it in
The only relevance of the question of

whether or not there is impairment would go to the degree of
impairment analysis under the Contract Clause.

We don't quarrel

that the result of the statute has been to change the overall
employment agreement involving these employees.

The court

below, in a footnote, I think, at page A-90 of the Appendix,
noted that employment agreement includes the wage agreement, the
pension plan, any other fringe benefits.

Now, our understanding

is that the Contract Clause issue raised by the Appellants

23

relates solely to the pension plan.

Novi, in the context of that

argument,, I think our point that there is really no contract
there is relevant,

However, if the Court is going to view the

entire employment agreement as a contract,, then I think these
arguments are relevant to the matter before the Court, as are
the retroactivity arguments.
Cur position is also that the Act is not retroactive
because It causes no phange in the benefit levels provided by
the plan, and therefore it does not impair the contract itself.
As a general matter the Act is tied to the specific benefit
levels that are provided by the plan to which it applies.

And

It should be noted that the Allied plan, itself, would provide
more liberal benefits in a planned termination situation than
our Act requires.

If you look at the termination article of

that pension plan, it states that "when the plan is terminated
all covered employees have a right to their earned interest in
their pension plan,,"
QUESTION:

In this case, in the facts of this

case, it is going to cost the country more money to close down
this plant than it would have if the Act hadn{t been passed,
quite a bit more money,
MR, S TARNS:

Yes, it will cost them seme more money.

And our position is that the money that it costs them is in the
form of the wages that they have owing to the employees for the
work rendered up to this point.

Because they admit that the

24

pension benefits are wages.

And so. from that point of view-,

the statute really becomes a form of wage and hour protectioni
really,

It is not a retroactive wage increase,
QUESTION:

Mr, Sterns, if that argument is valid., you

didn't need the statute, you already owed the money.
No, Your Honor, the reason -« I think

MR® STARNS:

that's a good point in terms of logical consistency, but
unfortunately the decisions hold otherwise,
QUESTION:

They didn't owe the money, then.

MR, STARNS:

They hold that the companies, that the

employees cannot enforce any quasi-contractual obligations -~
QUESTION;

Then don't you have to acknowledge that

t

the statute is the source of the company's obligation to pay
higher wages?
Yes, but our point is —

MR, STARNS:

QUESTION:

— a new and different wage obligation than existed before?
MR® STARNS:
a new obligation.

Our point, Your Honor, is that it is not

It may be somewhat different,

It's a bigger one.

a bit of money, maybe.

Yes, there is the difference between

QUESTION:
MR. STARNS:

When dio the obligation come into being?
The obligation to pay came into being*

I think* with the passage of the law,
QUESTION:
self?

Well* haven't you just contradicted your»

You said it wasn't new,

If it came into being with the

passage of the law* then it's new isn't it?
MR* S TARNS:

i think the point I am trying to make*

Your Honor* is that the obligation is not new in terms of the
expectations of the parties*

It may be new in terms of the

express language of the agreement,

But under the decisions of

this Court relating to the Contract Clause* one of the things to
be analyzed in terras of studying the reasonableness of the
legislation that is being challenged is the extent to which it
promotes* rather than undercuts* the original expectations of
the parties*
QUESTION:

But d on 5 fc you have to decide which party's

expectation you are going to look at?

It is the same expecta­

tion from the employees but different from the employer*

And

if you look at it that way* supposing there hadn't been enough
money in the company and the legislature decided the only way
to satisfy the expectations of the junior employees would be to
take some of the vested compensation away from the senior
employees on the ground that they had been over paid over the
years and they are going to get Social Security anyway* and so
forth.

And their expectations would be frustrated* but the

juniors 1 would be fulfilled.
MR, S TARNS:

Could you do that?

I think there might be a problem with

that# and of course -»
QUESTION:

What’s the difference?

MR, STARNS :

Well# our Act does not have any effect

upon the vested -- the funds In the trust.
QUESTION:

Is there a difference as far as the im­

pairment of contract law is concerned whether it's an employer
or a group of old employees that is affected by it?

What is

the distinction?
MR. STARNS:

1 think# Your Honor# in the concept of

this case# if we analyze what the expectations of the parties
are# the employer has# in effect# created an impossibility situ­
ation for performance by the employees.

In other words# he has

reneged on his expectation that he would achieve# as a result
of this plan# continuity of employment.
reneged on that.

He has voluntarily

And the person that suffers is the employee

who is denied the continuing opportunity to qualify for a
pension,
QUESTION:

You say he has voluntarily reneged.

What

specific do you rely on?
MR. STARNS:

He has reneged by removing the work

place as a place to work and he has made that decision con­
sciously for business reasons# or whatever.

But it seems to

me., in terms of the original underlying bargain# it was that

27

the employer expected to get out of his pension plan continuity
of employment*

It would help his situation, In terms of the

competition for labor.

He expected, presumably, to get some

decrease in wage demands, because it is a form of compensation»
QUESTION;

What's the basis for any expectation that

this company was going to stay in Minnesota forever?
MR, STARNS;

I think the basis would be, Your Honor,

the express language of the plan, which X noted earlier that
contains a covenant not to compete, for example, which would
seem to make no sense —
QUESTION;

You mean you would read that as a contract,

’continue to do business in Minnesota in perpetuity"?
MR, STARNS:

No, Your Honor, X would read it as an

indication of what are the reasonable expectations of the
parties to this original agreement.

And, as I .understand the

decisions of the Court, the expectations of the parties are
an important factor in determining the degree of infringement,
and therefore whether a statute has violated the Contract Clause
And, that’s assuming we have a contract.

We are already beyond

the initial —
QUESTION:

Why would the employer have any expectation

other than that his contract was to be executed exactly as it
was originally drafted until it was changed'with his consent?
MR* STARNS:

Well, I think that’s true and our point

is that the original contract is at best ambiguous on this point

23
It doesn't address —
QUESTION:

Suppose he has been paying into a pension

plan for ten years and there were one hundred employees that
have come at different times.

At the end of the ten years

let's assume there is vesting in ten years -- some have vested
and some haven't.

Can he terminate

If he terminates the

plan then* under these particular contracts, can he get all of
the money back out of the fund that he has been paying in, or
any?
MR. STARNS:

Under the Allied pension plan* every

employee could get a share, if the plan were fully funded.

If

it were not —
QUESTION:

He has been paying for ten years and he

Just wants to quit, and so quits., he terminates the plan.
MR, STARNS:
QUESTION:

No* he cannot get anything out.
No.

Under this plan, then, there is a

contract with the employees to the extent that he has paid into
a fund.
MR, STARNS:

Only if he maintains, only if he meets

the two conditions for vesting.
QUESTION:

And those are

Yes, but he can’t get his money bade if

he terminates the plan.
MR, STARNS:

This doesn't involve an employee contri­

QUESTION:

I understand,

MR. STA HNS:
QUESTION.*

That5 s correct.
So once he pays into the fund, it's gone,

as far as he's concerned,
MR, STARNS:
QUESTION*.
MR, STARNS:

Right,
Whether he terminates the plan or not,
Correct.

Except I would point out. Your

Honor, that there is one provision in the plan that if there
is an excess after the money has been distributed, it does go
back to the employer.

It is a minor point.

But there is the

possibility to receive money back,
QUESTION:

Do you think the State of Minnesota could

pass a law and say that the employer may terminate and get his
money back?
MR. STARNS:
QUESTION:
MR. STARNS;

No,
That would be an Impairment?
Yes.

I think that in the context of the

facts of this case, though, Your Honor, that the way this would
work —
QUESTION:

If what your saying, in effect, is you can

impair so far as the employer is concerned, but not so far as
the employee is concerned,
MR. STARNS;

That may be the case. Your Honor.

I think

w© are talking about that the public purpose of the statute is
the first bench march of analysis.

What is the public purpose

30

here?
QUESTION;

What if the Minnesota Legislature had

decided that most Minnesota manufacturing companies had put
much too much money into pension funding for their financial
stability.

And, therefore, it was of great importance for the

state to enable them to reduce these commitments,

And., there­

fore, It adopted this other provision that Justice White pro­
posed to you.

Do you think that would be an impairment?

MR* STARNS:

I think It may not, if the Court were to

accept those situations as constituting *>■*•
QUESTION:

You mean you could deny the employee his

vested rights for a good reason, right?
MR. S TARNS:

I think that is what the doctrine and

the teaching of this‘Court's decisions are, that you can't
Impair contracts.

You can't enact retroactive laws.

QUESTION:

But wouldn't that be a difference between

the situation I gave you a net the law which, instead of doing
what I suggested, had said to the employer, "You must now double
your contributions to the pension fund, despite what your, bar­
gained for contract was, or your voluntary contract with your
old employees, you must now fully fund your plan and you must
double. Allied you must double your payment to the plan"?
MR. STARNS:

Well, of course, full funding of plans

is what ERISA is all about.
QUESTION:

Yes. , That certainly would not be

inconsistent with his contract with his employees.

He has

promised them only to put in X and now it is two X.

QUESTION:

For that* do you need to go through any

MR» STARNS:

I don't believe so. Your Honor* because

it is in the nature of a minimum wage type protection.

If you

pensation.
QUESTION:

Well*, what Jf.-a state passed a minimum

MR. STARNS:

It

I think the distinction is that we

have recognized by our decisions that the accrued pension —
that deferred pension rights are a form of compensation.

So

to that extent, the employee has an accrued or incurrent right
to the amount that he has earned in those pension benefits.
That’s not the same as changing a $5 an hour contract to a $6
an hour contract and relating it back «QUESTION:

But* in your answer to Brother Rehnquist.

do you mean it would be an impairment or would it be a due

process violation?
MHo STARNS:

Well, I assume if there was a specific

contract -QUESTION;

Well, the employer did promise to pay him

and he had paid him what he had promised to pay him, $10 an
hour,

And now the legislature comes along and says, "We think

you should have been paying him $15 an hour, and furthermore
you should have been paying him that for the last two years»
so pay it to him."

Is that an impairment?

MR, STARNS:

Well/ It would probably be as well a

due process point, Your Honor; like the Usery ease which in­
volved the black lung benefits and the requirement of payment
of those benefits for employees who had terminated prior to
the effective date of the Act.

I think the example you pose

is very similar to that one.
As we stated, even if it is found that there is
contract impairment here, the Act is not unconstitutional.
Public purpose to protect employees 1 accrued interest in
pension,rights to establish full funding of pension plans is
clear.

ERISA is a monument to that fact.

It is reasonable,

Judged by the extent of impairment, and it is necessary judged
under this Court’s decisions in the U.S. Trust case.
That completes my argument.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I have nothing further.

33

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE B, CHRISTENSEN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR, CHRISTENSEN:

Briefly, if I may, Your Honor.

I am not sure that I understand this case any more.
I have just heard counsel, I think# say that a minimum wage
made two years retroactive would be unconstitutional,

I think

I heard him say earlier, that-they didn't think this statute was
retroactive.

I don't see how the two go together.

The one

thing we appear to be in agreement on is that contributions to
a pension plan are a form of compensation, a form of wage.
And there can be no doubt,, no doubt whatsoever that retro­
active wages are required by this statute.
Now, I could go on and argue, but I don't think I
could make the matter any clearer than I have with that blunt
assertion.
I would like, if I might, to talk about the line of
distinction that counsel would draw between bargained plans
and unbargained plans.

These contracts, it seems to us, were

as binding upon the employer as one bargained out with a labor
union.

And so long as that plan was in effect «— and about this

there can be no doubt —> if the company failed to make the re­
quiret contributions, to it each year, the employer could be
sued by all or any of these employees,

They were a condition

of his contract of labor or employment.
QUESTION:

The suit would be in assumpsit?

It would

34
be a suit in assumpsit under a contract?
MR, CHRISTENSEN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,

Illinois assumpsit,

Minnesota assumpsit,

excuse me.
MR, CHRISTENSEN:

Yes., it would be a suit on a

contract.
It is a long time since I dealt with assumpsit and
I am not sure that I am speaking -QUESTION:

It is quite a while since I have, too,

MR, CHRISTENSEN:

There was a question at noon:

What

was impaired here?
Specifically, there was. the right to terminate the
plan without penalty.

And upon termination of the plan, what­

ever rights any employee had were fully vested»

Now, under the

plan, they wouldn't all get money, so there wasn't money there„
But. if this had been an enormously successful plan, if we as»
sums that the funds had been invested by the trustees in some
wildly successful speculative venture, it very well might be
that everyone would have been paid in full.

And if, in the

unlikely circumstance there would be a surplus, then the
company would get it*

But there would have been no forfeiture

of any kind *

I cannot imagine a more direct
And that has been held*

And over

the noon hour, 1 have been informed, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,
that in the Detroit RaiIwa y case,which was sometime in the
teens or twenties, this Court has held that adding to the
burdens of a contract impairs the contract.
I have seen other cases in my research in this thing
but I can't recite them to the Court right now, I am sorry to
say.
The presentation that has been made orally is so
different from the presentation made in the brief
QUESTION:

Do you think if an employer and a union

have a collective bargaining contract that’s going to last for
the next three years that the legislature can’t require the
payment of a higher wage than is specified in the contract?
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

Well, I think, yes, they can,

assuming — if it meets due process, as you do with minimum
wages.

They cut right through the Pair labor Standards —
QUESTION:

That’s adding to the burden of a contract

making an employer pay more than he ever promised to pay*

Is

that an impairment?
MR, CHRISTENSEN:
QUESTION:

Oh, you say can the state do it?

Yes.

MR, CHRISTENSEN:

Oh, I beg your pardon.

I thought

you were talking of the federal government,
No., sir, the state could not do it.
QUESTION:

Could a state do it prospectively?

the balance of the contract term.

For

Say the contract's got three

years to run and the state legislature says*, "For the next two
years * you must double the pay into the contract."
MR, CHRISTENSEN;
QUESTION;

I don't think sc,

What about if a state were to say* "For

every employee you hire from now on you will have to pay him
$4 per hour."
MR, CHRISTENSEN:

And what becomes of the $4. Your

Honor?
QUESTION;

Whatever the employee wants* I suppose,

MR. CHRISTENSEN:

So you increase the wage?

I think the answer is the same.

I 'would answer that

Question no* the state cannot do it.
QUESTION:

If there were or tirere not a collective

bargaining agreement* would it make a difference — between
the employer and the representative of the employees?
MR, CHRISTENSEN:

In my Judgment * no.

X think the

individually made contract is just as sacred and immune to state
impairment as a collectively bargained type.
QUESTION:

In my brother Rehnquisfe's case* you wouldn't

have an individual contract with future employees.

You would

hire them only after the state had enacted this statute

37
requiring a minimum per hour of $4,
MR. CHRISTENSEN:
QUESTION;

If you had no contract, then —

You wouldn't because, by definition, these

are new employees.
Suppose you have a contract with a union that says,
"We'll pay $3." And the union says fine and it is a union shop.
So there has been a promise to pay only $3*
MR. CHRISTENSEN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

And the state says, "Sorry, but you must

pay $4."
MR. CHRISTENSEN;

I think that would violate the

obligation of contract.
QUESTION:

How about if there were no collective

bargaining agreement, and the statute applied only to future
employees subsequently hired?
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

Then, I think you have a different

question.
QUESTION:

You certainly do, don't you?

MR, CHRISTENSEN:

That's all 1 have,

Thank you for

your attention.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.
