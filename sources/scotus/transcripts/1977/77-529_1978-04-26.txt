Mr. Werner, I think you- may proceed whenever you are

PSA.L ARGUMENT Off JOSEPH G. WERNER, ESQ. ,
CM BEHALF OP THE PETITIONERS
MR. WERNERs
the Courts

Mr, Chief Justice,, and may it please

X am Joseph Werner, counsel for the petitioners in

this ease, the Mayor and City Council of the City of Dallas.
This is a civil rights case in which Negro voters of
the City of Dallas challenge the all at-large system of
electing the City Council in Dallas.
The District Court held that that all at-large
system was Unconstitutional in that it denied Negro voters
equal protection.
QUESTION 8

Was that under- the Equal Protection

Claus© of the 14th Amendment?
MR. WERNERt
QUESTIONS
MR.; WEKNBRc

Y@8, sir.
Not the 15th Amendment at all?
No, sir.

It was alleged that there was

a violation of the 15th Amendment, but —
QUESTION?

But the grounds for the court9s decision

was the Equal Protection Claus© of the 14th Amendment?
MR., WERNER*

Yes, sir

4
QUESTIONS

Insofar as the Dallas electoral system

discriminated racially , is that it?
MR, WERNER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
There was no finding of any violation of

Reynolds v. Sims?
MR. WERNER:

No, sir, there is no question of Sims.

It was a purely at-large system in the beginning, there is no
question of numerical imbalance, but that it was a white versus
.register-type dilution problem and not a -QUESTION:
MR. WERNER:
QUESTION:

Not a 15th Amendment problem?
No, sir.
But there was no finding of any constitu­

tional violation here, was there, in the at-large system?
MR. WERNER:

Yes, sir.

The purely at-large -- you

see, it started out with all eleven members of the council
elected at-large citywide.

The District Court found that that

system was unconstitutional in that it denied equal protection
to the Negro voters.
QUESTION:

And this case does not involve that issue,

does it?
MR. WERNER:
QUESTION:
MR. WERNER:
QUESTION:
violation?

No, sir.
You have a totally new structure now?
Yes, sir.
But it didn't find a one-man, one-vote

5
MR» WERNER;

No, sir.

Mo, sir.

As I said, because

it was purely at™large in the beginning, there was no possi­
bility of a numerical imbalance.
QUESTIONS
MR. WERNER;

Right.
The District Coart, after it held the

previous system unconstitutional, gave the City of Dallas and
the City Council an opportunity to come up with a plan to
remedy this constitutional violation.

The court held hearings

subsequently in which it received this 8-3 plan which was
generated by the City Council, and this plan involves the
election of 8 of the 11 council members from single-me?aber
districts and the election of the remaining 3 members at-large
citywideo
QUESTION;

Mr. Werner, you refer to the plan having

been generated by the City Council.

Would you tell us exactly

how that happened step by step?
MR. WERNER;

Yes, sir.

The process was that on the

17th of January, the court held the original'plan unconstitu­
tional , three days later the City Council adopted a resolution
which informed the court that it was the intent of the council
to pass an ordinance which would adopt this 8-3 plan.

On

February 5th the court commenced hearings on this proposed 8-3
plan and on two alternate plans submitted by the plaintiffs in
the case.

On the 8th of February, the District Judge announced

a preliminary finding that he considered the 8-3 plan to be

6

constitutional*,

Two days later, after the conclusion of that

hearing, the City Council adopted the ordinance, 14800, which
promulgated as law the 8“3 plan»
QUESTION;

But the City Council had not adopted a

plan until after the court approved the plan that was suggested?
MR. WERNER:

That’s correct, sir.

QUESTION:

Except by a resolution.

\

MR. WERNER:

Except by a resolution.
*

QUESTION:

Well, the City Council did it though,

didn’t it?
MR. WERNER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
But it just wasn't in the form of an

ordinance?
MR. WERNER:
QUESTION:
MR. WERNER:
QUESTION:
MR. WERNER:

That’s correct, sir.
Is the resolution in the record?
Yes, sir.
It might as well have been an ordinance?
Well, I think if it had been an ordin­

ance, there wouldn’t be any question at this point.
QUESTION:
MR. WERNER:

Well, why should there be any difference?
Well, I think in fairness to the

respondents in this case, there is some ambiguity in the reso­
lution.

I think it clearly indicates that what the legislative

body favored was the 8-3 plan.
QUESTION:

However, the resolution —

Of course, that is what the City Council

7
was proposing,
MR, WERNER?

Yas, sir.

QUESTION?

That is clear enough.

QUESTION:

Let me ask yon this question: Did the City

Council have any power or authority to approve a plan defini­
tively?

Did it not have to be submitted to the voters?
MR. WERNER;

,

Mr, Justice Powell what we had here

was a previous plan prescribed by charter.

Now,, obviously the

charter, somewhat like our city constitution, cannot be amended
except by vote of the people.
QUESTION s
MR. WERNER?

However, after the --

Or an order of the court.
Yes, sir.

After the order of the

District Court declaring it unconstitutional, then that charter
provision, our position is, ceases to exist, and we have the
authority as a home-rule city under the laws of Tessas to
evidence cur actions either by resolution, by ordinance or by
vote of the people in the form of the charter,
QUESTION:

And you might just as well have passed

the ordinance when you passed the resolution, except you prob­
ably would rather know whether it was constitutional before you
passed it as an ordinance.
MR. WERNER;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.
Is that the explanation of why the council

proceeded by resolution rather than ordinance at that time?
MR, WERNERs

Mr. Justice Brennan, frankly we don’t

8
know at this point, we can®t recall; and I assume that that
is what we were doing*

If

wq

had had the benefit of Chapman

v, Meier which was decided within a few days —
QUESTIONs

Wall, what if it. had been an ordinance

when the resolution was passed, what if it had been done in
the fora of an ordinance, the District Court would have done
exactly the same thing with respect to it?
MS* WERNER:

Yes, sir, I think it would have*

And 7.

think if it had been passed as an ordinance a few days before
the hearing, then there would be no question that the city had
promulgated this plan as law and that it was binding,
QUESTION:
MR. WERNERS
' QUESTION;

Mr, Werner?
Yes, sir?
The question I am. novs going to ask you

is not addressed to the merits in -this case but you filed an
application for a stay with ma last August, your name is on it,
and it states "The City Council reapportioned itself and
enacted an ordinance” -\

MR, WERNERJ
QUESTION:
ing,'3

Yes, sir,

\

— "and thereafter the court held a hear­

Now, that was in error, I take it, from what you now

say?
MR, WERNER:

Mr. Justice Powell, if I said that, I

would have misled the Court and you, sir.
QUESTION:

I think I repeated it in a Chambers

9
opinion» I will say this, in fairness, the District Court said
pretty much the same thing.
that is now what happened.

But as 1 now understand the facts,
I am not suggesting that it makes

any difference, as Mr. Justice White indicated, hut 1 do sug­
gest that the papers filed here, while I am on this subject, I
must say that the response to your application didn't clarify
it either.
MR. WERNER;

Well, Mr. Justice Powell, what happened

here was that there was — on the 8th of February, there was
no order entered and the docket doesn't reflect any order.
What happened was the judge made a preliminary finding that he
considered the 8-3 plan to be acceptable.

There was no order,

written order of any description entered until March 25th,
about sir weeks later, and of course the judgment in the case
was not entered until May 22nd, which was about three and a
half months later.

So we didn't consider at that point that

there had been any — at the time the ordinance was adopted, we
did not consider that there had been any binding order of the
court issued.
QUESTION?

Go ahead.

I just wanted to clarify that,

I felt when I finally saw the papers in this case that both
parties had failed adequately to inform me whan this matter
was before me last summer.
MR. WERNER;

Yes, sir.

Well, if we misled you and

the Court, we apologise for that, but it was 1 think the

10

contention between the parties, has always been the authority
of the city to snake a change to the election plan through the
means of an ordinance rather than by a charter amendment, and
I donsfc think at that time any of the parties considered the
timing of this ordinance to be critical, and 1 don* t think we
considered that the ordinance was adopted after an order of
the court,
QUESTION s

Now you are confusing ms.

previously of a resolution, not an ordinance,.

Yon have spoken
Now, which was

■the source of th© new 0-3 plan, a resolution or an ordinance?
MR. WERNER:
both.

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there were

On the 20th of January, before the remedy hearing, there

was a resolution passed stating the intention of the council to
adopt the 8-3 plan.

Then the remedy hearing was held in the

District Court and then two days after the conclusion of that
hearing the ordinance was passed.
QUESTION i

fed that was pursuant to the directives of

the court?

i
MR. WERNER:

No, sir, there was no directive of the

court when they passed the ordinance.
QUESTION:

The court addressed itself to the plan

submitted by the city under the resolution?
MR. WERNER:
QUESTION:
MR. WERNER:

Yes, sir.
Mid said it was constitutional?
Yes, sir.

11
QUESTIONs

Now, did it purport to treat that eis a

court plan and say.. "I approve this plan," or did they — you
know, usually if the city passes an ordinance, it isn't a
court plan, it’s just something you either accept or reject.
MR. WERNER;

Yes, sir.

I

QUESTION s

What did the court do with respect to the

resolution?
On February 8, at the conclusion of

MR. WERNER;

the hearing, Judge Mahon, the district judge, made a rather
lengthy statement from the bench in which he said that he finds
that the 8-3 plan, in his words, "passes constitutional mus­
ter,™ and he said, "I will later enter findings" — he said
QUESTION;

Did he ever incorporate that plan in a

decree?
MR. WERNER;

Yes, sir.

The first writing from the

court —
QUESTION;

Well, you don't do that with an ordi­

nance that you uphold.

You just say its constitutional.

You

look to the ordinance to see what the provisions are.
MR. WERNER;

I may have misunderstood your question,

Mr. Justice Whits.
QUESTION s

Did he incorporate the very terms of the

plan in the decree?
MR. WERNER;
QUESTION s

No, sir, only by saying that h©
Found it constitutional?

12
MR. WERNER;

Constitutional, yes.

QUESTION s

All right.

QUESTIONS

When he approved tha 8-3 plan, it was

simply a holding of the court that it passed constitutional
standards, but it9s not part of a decree?
MR. WERNER?

No, sir. And there was no written order

of any description entered until long after the ordinance was
enacted.
QUESTI CM;

1 think I have the language of the

District Court that Mr. Justice White may have? in mind.

It is

on page B-16' in the petition, at the end of the middle para­
graph.

That9s B-16.
"This court then gave the city of Dallas an oppor­

tunity to perform its duty to enact a constitutionally accept­
able plan.

I find, that it has met that duty in enacting the

8-3 plan of electing council members.'5
Now, in light of what I now understand, the cor­
rect, to say the least, they us© the word "enacting” somewhat
\

loosely.
QUESTION:
MR. WERNER;
QUESTION;

Expressing an intent.
Yes, sir.
Well, at least he treated it as an offi­

cial expression of the city.
QUESTION;

And then after this decree it was followed

by an ordinance, and that in turn was followed by a charter

13

amendment»
MR. WERNER;

Yes, that is my understanding; yes,

that is correct.
QUESTION:

Wasn’t it true that there was an oral

opinion first which was than followed by the ordinance which
was then followed by what Mr. Justice Powell just read?
MR. WERNERs
resolution.

Mr. Justice Stevens, there was the

Then

QUESTION s

On January 20th?

MR. WERNERs
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
And then on February 8th there was the

remedy hearing, in which he made an oral decision?
MR., WERNER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Mid there then was an ordinance which is

No. 14800, which refers back to the oral decision; is that not
right?
MR. WERNER:
QUESTION %

Yes, sir.
And then after the ordinance was passed,

there was than the written decision that Mr. Justice Powell
read from in March?
MR. WERNERs

Yes, sir, March 25.

QUESTION:

So this was after the ordinance.

QUESTION:

The oral decision was between the resolu­

tion and the ordinance.
QUESTION s
Benactment® there

The enactment of the ordinance, the word

14
MR. WERNER:

Well# I think the reference is to the

ordinance, but I can81 b® certain what ha meant.
QUESTION s
MR. WERNER:
QUESTION:

By this time there was an ordinance?
Yes, sir.
At the time of the ordinance there had

already been a decision by the court, because the ordinance itself refers to the decision.
I call your attention to page A-2.
MR. WERNER:

Yes, sir, it refers to the oral deei-

sion, and if I may, 1511 read from the transcript of the
judge8s remarks.
page 86.

This is Volume 11 of the original transcript,

The court says:
"This court is*3 -QUESTION s

Do we have it hers at all?

In tho

appendix?
MR. WERNER:

No, sir, it6s not reproduced in hare.

The district judge says:
"This court is accepting the city plan of 8-3.

I

am ordering that the election schedule for April of this year
will proceed and elect the city council for this year under
x

i

the plan of 8-3 that has been presented to this court.

At

the same time this court will, I am going to enter a final
order, X mean a judgment of opinion that is going ‘to take me
several days,5' and so forth.
So he indicated at that time, it seems to us, that

IS
this was a tentative or prelirainary decision on the matter and
that he intended shortly thereafter to render his official
decision on the case»
Now, Mr. Chief Justice and my it please the Court,
it0a our position that at the time that the court first entered
a written order and its first binding order that the city
council had already promulgated as law this 8-3 plan which is
in contention.

By the tin® the filing data arrived for the

ensuing election? the plan had bean promulgated as law and by
•the time the judgment was finally entered in the case? of
course» the plan had been promulgated as law by the city
council.
We contend that: because the council had promulgated
as law this election plan with full authority under stab© law»
that 'this is not a court-ordered plan and that the special cir­
cumstances rule of the East Carroll case should not apply.

We

suggest instead that the rule of Burns v. Richardson applies
and that the plan should bs subject only ‘to constitutional re­
view.
Alternatively, we submit to the Court that even if
the East Carroll rule is applicable# that the Court of Appeals
lias erred in saying that the special circumstances present in
the case which deal with the voting situation of MexicanAmerican voters can be considered only if there is a constitu­
tional violation, and we think this is contrary to indications

IS
that we see in the opinion in the United Jewish Organizations
v. Carey case.
We do not think that special circumstances in a case
like this depend on a prior stowing of constitutional viola­
tioni. and we think in this case as in any equitable case? or
decree in equity? that the court should take into consideration
■die general public interest and should not enter a decree which
will harm any segment of the population? and we think that the
findings of the District Court show that if an all single
member district plan ware put into effect? that the MexicanAmerican voters would very definitely be harmed by that de­
cree.
The other issue in the case "which supports the use
of a mixed at-large and. single member system is the finding of
the District Court that it would be beneficial to the city to
have general city-wide interest represented on the City Ccun\
oil so as to provide factionalism among wards within the city
■

\

and so that the City Council members would be'\ exposed to a
\
\

more statesman-3.ike view? and that projects of interest to the
city in general would not suffer from having been subjected to
ward interest and factionalism»
Kay it pleasa the Court? we811 reserve the rest of
our time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs
Mr. Jo Ins ton.

Very well? Mr. Werner.

17
ORai, ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. JOHNSTON, JR., ESQ, ,
OP BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. JOHNSTON 8

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court, it is the contention of respondents her© today that
this Court is dealing with a fact situation ‘that is clearly
within the ambit of Connor v. Johnson and East Carroll Parish
V. Marshall.

Wa believe that the threshhold issue is the

standard of review that is to foe applied fey an appeals court
and that that standard of review is determined by whether or
not we*re dealing with a court-ordered plan or legislative
plan.
It is our contention that we have her© very clearly
a court-ordered plan, that is a plan that was ordered into
existence by a federal court exercising its equitable juris­
diction in an adversary proceeding.
Now, there is some ambiguity in the record as it is
presented in the appendix and I*d like to address myself to
that at this time,

'four questionings already have indicated

some- elements of that ambiguity.

2 would point out on page

147 of fcha appendix that the court Itself stated that at the
close of testimony on'February 8, 1975, 131 made findings which
approved the city* s plan as constitutional.

Accordingly I

ordered that the 8-3 plan as had been offered by the city be
instituted in time for the April 1975 City Council election,B
Lot ms point out at this point that the City

18
Cornell does not, either by resolution or by ordinance, have
the power to change the election system in the city of Dallas.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Johnston, does it have authority by

resolution to empower its legal counsel to make representations
to the district court in a case like this?
MR. JOHNSTONs

It can and did empower its legal re­

presentatives to make representations to the court, and I haves
here and can supply to the Court a copy of the accompanying
letter that counsel for the city sent, to the court, and that
accompanying letter saids
"Pursuant to your order issued January .17 I am en­
closing a certified copy of the Dallas City Council resolution
dated January 20. "
I think what is clear here is that this resolution
was offered pursuant to an order of the court to offer —
QUESTION s

That sounds like we®re going back to the

forms of action, to make this sort of distinction between a
court saying, 5,We will impos® a plan but let's hear from the
city as to what kind of a plan it wants," and saying that
that8s subject to a different standard of scrutiny and saying
that — than for a court to say that the present plan is un­
constitutional , let the city try again.
MIL JOHNSTON*

I think the distinction has to be made

as to whether or not the city has th© authority to try again
under its own legislative scheme.

19
QUESTION*

Why is that for a federal court to decide?

MR. JOHNSTOW;

Well, we are talking about legislative

power and the constitution of th© stata of Texas denies to the
City Council «■*
QUESTION?

Why are we talking about — 1 don't see

why we are talking about legislative power.

We're trying to

decide what standards the district court is supposed to use,
and her® this was an unambiguous expression of the lawmakers’
views in the city of Dallas.
MR* JOHN ST OH*

The courts had before in East Carroll#

the same kind of unambiguous statement of what the city would
choose.
QUESTION?

I take it the district court had rejected

the plan as unconstitutional and proceeded to draw up its own,
might bo something ©Isa again# or if the city lawyer had just
submitted the plan without any evidence that it was official
policy of the city.
MR. JOHMSTONs

Well# the case law to this point would

indicate that this court has been looking as in East Carroll
to the authority of th© city to —
QUESTION*

So you would say if th© city had had

power to change the representative schema overnight by an
ordinance# and if their first action in response to the court's
suggestion had to pass a new ordinance# the case would b©
different?

20
\ MR. JOHNSTONs

Well, the case would be different and

I would still urge the same result, because we are dealing with
a plan that was offered up after the fact of dilution of
black voting strength, that finding had already been made by
the trial court.

We're not talking about a situation where in

'die course of litigation the city changes its election —
QUESTIONS

It sounds to me like you5re urging that

the substitute plan offered was unconstitutional.
MR, JOHNSTONs

No, ws^re saying only at this point

that it violatas the federal common law of voting rights,
QUESTION s
rights,, do you?

You don91 moan the common law of voting

You mean the appropriate equitabile remedies

for violation of the Constitution?
MR. JOHNSTONs

That language is not my own; it

appears in this
QUESTION.?

I wouldn’t adopt it, if I ware you.

QUESTIONS

You don’t find it murky?

QUESTION;

We'r® talking th® precedents to which you

refer and upon which you rely have to do with what's appro­
priate and equitable remedy to repair a constitutional viola­
tion, and the oases to which you refer all involve violations
of the doctrine of Reynolds v.Sims.

Not a single one of them

that I know of involved a violation of such as was found hare,
which we don't have .before us and therefore we can't assess
as to even whether or not it was a constitutional violation.

2i
But there's no claim that there was a violation of
the so-called one-person, one-vote?
MR, JOKEJSTONs
QUESTIONi

That's correct.

And indeed, all the cases to which you

refer, none of thorn with which I'm familiar, and you're free
to correct me and I may be wrong, I often am, have to do with
at-large municipal elections of councilman, and there's been
a presumption in this case that multi-member districts to a
state legislature are somehow the exact equivalent of at-large
elections of 'municipal, in a municipality, to the city govern­
ment.

And they1’re quite two different animals.
MS. JOHNSTONs

Let me respond, if I may.

The — in

East Carroll Parish v, Marshall, began in th© context of a
Baker v. Carr, one-man —
QUESTION*

Correct.

MR. JOHNSTONS

Okay.

However, when the court ap­

proved the Parish's proposed all at-larg© plan in 1971, Mr»
Marshall intervened alleging that that plan diluted black
voting strength in th© Parish.

The district court rejected

that finding but it was preserved for appeal to the court of
appeals, and the court of appeals found in fact that there had
been a dilution of black voting strength as alleged by Mr.
Marshall.
And so when that case, East Carroll, was before this
Court, it ms before this Court on that basis as well as on the

22
one-manf one-vote basis.
QUESTION%

It did involve a school district but it

did not involve a home rule municipality» did it?
ME. JOHNSTONs

That9s correct, Your Honor, but the

fact that the city of Dallas is a tome rule city should not
overlook the fact that it is limited in its ability to devise
its own election schema.
QUESTION:

It must submit —

Yesr but I'm talking about the constitu­

tional tests here and the remedy for asserted constitutional
violation.

This violation was not a Reynolds v. Sims viola­

tion —
MR. JOHNSTONs
QUESTION:

That's correct.

— and we're not talking here about

multi-member districts to 3i:ate legislatures.
MR. JOHNSTONs

That's correct.

But it would see» to

ms that the federal remedy which we urge and which East
Carroll urges;, which would require single-member districts
absent unusual circumstances, is particularly appropriate when
there was a finding by the district court as 'die result of an
adversary proceeding that there was, that the at-large fesi­
tares of the city of Dallas election system diluted black
minority voting strength.
For the city to come back with three at-large seats
preserving that same feature found unconstitutional, and —
QUESTION:

That's a given ir. this case, but in

33
assessing this plan, don’t we again have to look and soa
•whether an at-large election 1b unconstitutional?

Isn’t that

at least the throshhold inquiry?
'

MR, JOHNSTON:

Wall , the district court had already

xaade findings —
QUESTION3

Well, the district court did —

QUESTIONS

But you're her©, now.

QUESTIONi

— but you’re here now, and if there's

nothing at all unconstitutional about at-large elections in a
municipality of th© governing body of th© city, that's the
end of this eas©r isn't it?
4

MR, JQHNSTGPi

Well, if the Court wishes to address

itself to that issue, it may do so,
QUESTIONs

Well, isn’t that a threshold issue here?

MR, JOHNSTON:

Mo one els®, certainly petitioners

have not raised that issue and did not appeal in either court
of appeals —
QUESTION s

Well, they certainly raised it. to the ex­

tent that they say the at-large election of three members of
X

th© City Council is not unconstitutional.
ME. JOHNSTONj

That's correct.

And

X

would point out

to th© Court iiuat Wallace v. House dealt with a eonrnis sionor

form of government for a city, and that is a case-where the
court of appeals of this circuit has, as in this case, had to
address itself to that issue.

24
This court remanded that case to the 5th Circuit for
review in light of East Carroll Parish.

The circuit examined

the entire record and examined contentions very much like the
city's here that at-large elections preserve a city-wide view
and rejected that as having established any kind of unusual
circumstances.
QUESTIONS

Has this court ever held that an at-

large election within a jurisdiction is unconstitutional?
Be it city or state?

MR. JOHNSTON;

1 think Wallas© v. House? wells,

tacitly reaches that point, because it goes immediately to the
raiftsdy ~
QUESTION %

The remedy? yes * the remedy.

QUESTION'S

But'those are all based oh one-man? one-

vote violations? and then' you get the remedial phase? weren't
they?
MR. JOHNSTON s

It'& not my understanding that

Wallace is based on one-men? one-vote.

My reflection of the

record in that case indicates that there was an allegation of
and finding in the 5th Circuit that there was dilution.
QUESTIONs

That isn't one-man? one-vote? it isn’t,

exactly one-man? one-vote.

Whitcomb v. Chaves certainly re­

jects any notion that at-large voting in the city is per se
or even semi par se invalid.
MR. JOHNSTON %

That's correct? but it does indicate

that if the proof is there? and White v. Register goes further

25
than that and says that the.proof was there in that circumstance,, than you have established a constitutional violation
of equal protection,
QUESTI® §

But on© of the original complaint in

Whitcomb v. Chaves; wasn® t that tm 11i-iraraber districts violated
the constitution, but there was a violation of the one-man,
one-vote principle? wass-x91 there?

And then the question was

whether the remedy was appropriate.
MR. JOHNSTON t
QUESTION $

I a&nst recall the record.

Let me back up on on© thing that9 s got

me somewhat confused.
Suppose Judge Mahon? 'the district judge? and after
asking the city to make suggestions and th© city made no sug­
gestions? h© had ordered th® 8"3 plan? and they carried it out
without a. resolution? without an ordinance, simply carrying
out th® court5s decree.

What would be your view, what effect

that would have on your posture now?
MR, JOHNSTONt

Well? our posture would be the same?

that it was in fact a court-ordered plan? subject ■*\

QUESTIONi

Well? for ail practical purposes it was

"a court-ordered plan? wasn’t it? and the city was simply as a
matter of comity or for whatever reasons passing an enactment
that carried out what they knew the court wanted and what the
court had said would pass constitutional mu©tar.
MR. JOHNSTQNs

And what the court would require as

26

a remedy*
We have no objection as such and did not object at
the time to the city offering to the court a plan»

There is

political expertise to be bad amongst members of the City
Council although their vote was not unanimousj their input
was important and we did not object to it as such*
What we did object to# what we did appeal from# was
preserving those same at-large features that the court had rejacted in finding that there was dilution of black voting
strength.
Now# it’s not easy to prove that there has been di­
lution of black voting strength by means of at-large elections.
Th© truth is not simple# but it was mat in this case.
QUESTIONS

It's particularly difficult# isn’t it#

when yon have an 8-3 plan# that is «sight of them elected by
districts and only three at-large? two at-large really# be­
cause one of them is the mayor.
MR. JOHNSTON;

That’s why 1 think the remedy required

by East Carroll is particularly appropriate in these kinds of
cases# because it instructs the city or whoever is working
with the court in order to propose a plan that they must do
several things# and one of those things is that they must
establish that there are unusual circumstances which will
justify th© continuation ©f any at-large features in that
plan.

It’s particularly appropriate in this case.

QUESTION t

Well , you wouldn’t suggest fox a moment

that in the course of this case that whatever state it was,
that the city — let's assume that the City Council of Dallas
had the power in its charter t© pass a new ordinans®»

It just

siEpiy passed a new ordinance and the old ordinance that the
court was considering just simply wasn’t there any more»

The

court would either —• the ordinance would either go into ef­
fect; it would go into effect unless it was enjoined and found
unconstitutional, wouldn't it?
MR» JOHNSTON:
QUESTIONS

Well, of course, that*s not the -■»

Well, 1 know you say it isn't the facts —

MR. JOHNSTGNs

Well, on® would have to, and I pre­

sume ©a© would seek soma sort of injunctive relief —
QUESTION a

But you would then have

to submit that

ordinance to the court and that ordinance would have to b©
found unconstitutional before it could be enjoined?

KR. JOHNSTON*
QUESTION s

That is —

hnd X' understand the 5th Circuit in this-

case ©ays that this ordinance is not unconstitutional.
MR. JOHNSTON:
that issue.

The circuit in this case never reached

If did not speak to that issue at all.

It said

that that was one of the things —
QUESTION3

Th© district court certainly did, didn't

it?
MR. JOHNSTONt

The district court certainly did

28
W© pointed out —
QUESTION 5

They said there was no unconstitutional

impaat whatsoever under this.
ME. JOHNSTON*

That* s correct.

Let me point out 'the

difficulties that anyone litigating a plan in a hurry where
we had an election coming up in April and w@ were in February,
v/a spent five years attempting to prove the unconstitution­
al tty of the eleven at»large seats in the city —
QUESTI®'%

Exactly, and the city same along and

passed a new ordinance.
MR. JOHNSTONs

Let me point out that the city —

and I think this is instructive.

We supplied the court with

a copy of the ballot that was used in April of 1976 when the
voters finally ratified that ordinance and finally amended the
charter with regard to th€! change in election scheme, and
that ballot on page 16 of the document we supplied the Court,
which begins with a letter from Mr. Werner to an attorney,
says, "Shall Chapter 3 Section 1 and Chapter 4 Section 4, 6
and 3 of the Charter of the City of Dallas be amended to pro­
vide for the compliance with the federal court order for
election of eight members to the City Council from single-»
member districts and three including the mayor at-large?"
We think that's instructive because it indicates
what, that the city believed as we believed that that elec­
tion that took place in April of 1976 was a housekeeping

23
measure merely to reflect the changes that were already made
by court order in the city court*
QUESTION 3

Was it part of your submission in opposing

the 8-3 ordinance that it was unconstitutional , or did you
merely argue that it was an inadequate remedy for the previously
i

found constitutional violation?
MR. JOHNSTON s

Our argument essentially ms that it

was an inadequate remedy.
QUESTION 3

So that there really has never been an

issue that anybody had to decide as to whether the 8-3 order
was constitutional or unconstitutional, is that correct?
MR. JGHNSTON.s

The judge presumed that if it were

constitutional, it would be an adequate remedy, although X may
point out. that the judge ms troubled by Carter v. Johnson
and throughout his opinion attempted, to state unusual circum­
stances such as the Mesican-American situation which would
justify the plan.

But we- were not anywhere equipped to ar­

gue the constitutionality of that plan because that kind of
proof is very difficult to some by, and in the short space of
time that w© had.
QUESTION %

If the fact or fcha conclusion of con­

stitutionality ware the end of the case he would not have
/

needed even to address the question of the Mexican-Americans,
is that not correct?
MR. JOHNSTON %

That's correct.

30
Set me also point out that as the government has
pointed out in its brief amicus that when this charter amendment was passed in April of 1976, Tessas was at that time
covered by the Voting Eights Act of 1965, something that it was
not covered when the ©as® was tried and the decision was
rendered in 1975.

And the city did not submit that case to

the Attorney General for preelaarane©.

The inference is that

the city believed that plan to be a court ordered' plan which
was not required to be submitted to the Attorney Sener&X under
the court0s language in Connor v. Johnson.
QUESTIONS

Well, the district court said it gave that

city a chance to come up with a plan and then he said, "X
find that it has met that duty in enacting the "S’-3 /
elect if

of

council members. *
MR. JOHNSTONs,

several respects.

The judge's opinion is ambiguous in

In that way it is ambiguous because the

court later on points out on page 151 of the appendi» that
member»: of the council cannot on their own modify the charter
to alter the voting scheme.
GUE&TIONs

Walli that may b® so, but this seems to

me rather unambiguous in saying that in his view the plan,
wherever it came from, passed constitutional muster.
MR. JOHNSTON *

Well, I think it is clear that the
*

court —
QUESTIONt ■ And don't you believe that the intervonor
ver© urging that the plan was unconstitutional?

31
And so there ms an issue before the judge about the
constitutionality of the plan.

He just didn' t make this, ar­

rive at this conclusion OTa sponte.
MR, JOHNSTON:

Well, I can only respond that tha

court was, as were the parties, operating under intense time
pressure —
QUESTIONS

That may be, but the intervenor s claimed,

it was unconstitutional and h© said the plan is constitution»
al.

Did you appeal that?

When you went to the 5th Circuit,

what did you say to them, what did you raise there?
MR. JOHNSTON:

Well, the issue that we raised in tha

5th Circuit was tha appropriateness of the remedy.
QUESTION s

And did you say the plan was unconstitu­

tional?
MR. JOHNSTON*
QUESTIONs

That appeal was some years ago,

Here's what the 5th Circuit said?

"It

cannot however be successfully maintained that the use of atlarge voting to elect three council members is itself consti­
tutionally defective."
MR. JOHNSTON:

that's correct, and there’s plenty

of language from this court indicating that at-large features
in and of themselves must be attacked on the factual basis
and the factual matrix in;o which they’ve developed.
QUESTION s

That is multi-member districts for a

state legislative body?

32
MR. JOHNSTONs

Well; that, I would say that Wallace

v. House and then applying it to the Parish as in East Carroll
indicates that the court is willing t© go further than that.
Let me conclude by saying that it is very difficult
to distinguish ~

\

Well then, it's certainly a decision of

MR. JOHNSTON %

Well, I would only say, Mr, Justice

Rehhquist, that the clear implication of the remand of
Wallace v. House was that what the court must consider, what
the court of appeals must consider was the appropriateness ©f

33
th® remedy.
QUESTIOM3

You mean otherwise why send it back under

East Carroll?
MR. JOHNSTON:

Exactly,

tod of course the court of

appeals did do that and cert was denied by this court.
QUESTIONS

Well, do you think all of our remands are

that precisely tailored that wa never grant vacate and remand
except having thought the thing through that carefully?
MR. JOHNSTGU s
QUESTION s

I would assume —

That'" s not a fair question to ask you.

(Laughter.)
QUESTIONt

I tuT.nt it’s very fair.

QUESTIONS

A remand is a question, not an answer.

If wa wore sure of the application we would summarily decide
the case, but it not being clear, we send it back and ask the
court of appeals to consider the relevance of East Carroll
and the others.
ME. JOHNSTON t

\
Well, when a court of' appeals did

reconsider, it asked itself a question of why the case ms
remanded rather than simply reversed or affirmed, and con­
cluded that the inquiry at* to the appropriateness of the
remedy under East Carroll was a factual on© that they could
undertake because they -had a complete record before them, and
they undertook at that point to determine whether or not
there war® unusual circumstances, found that there were not

34
ia ths face of claims much like the city of Dallas her©, and
as I •“
QUESTIONs

Mv& th&n didn’t it come back here again?

MR. JOHNSTON*

It did,, that’s correct.

1 find it difficult to distinguish this case from
East Carroll and from Wallace v. House? all oases that have
gone through the court of appeals with the 5th Circuit.

Each

time there war© plans submitted by the legislative body pur»
suant to court order? each time that that .legislative body
lacked the authority to draw up the plan, did not have the
authority for on© reason or another to implement the plan.
In East Carroll it was because of a challenge under Section
5 of the Voting Rights Act to the enabling legislation.

And

in each case the plan was ordered into affect by the courts.
How, one© you roach the threshold issue of whether
or not the rule of East Carroll is going to bs applied, the
issue becomes whether or not there are unusual circumstances
which would justify preservation of the at»large features.

Tim district court found such in the Mexican-American presence
in the city of Dallas, a minority group containing 8 to 10
percent of the population of the city of Dallas,
The trial court*& findings are confusing and contradictory and X think ultimately not based on fact and therefore
an abuso of the discretion of the trial court.

Trial court

found that there was no present dilution of Mexican** Amari can

35
voting strength? although there might have been dilution in
the past.

The court of appeals accordingly indicated that

there was? because there ms no present dilution? their access
was equal to that of the white majority and therefor© there ms
no need to enhance the benefits by these three at-large seats.
But more importantly it is the contention ©£ the
respondents that in order for there to be an

circum­

stance to support the Messican-American issue raised by the
district court? there would have to be facts in the record to
support tiie finding that single-member districts would 'restrict
the access of Mexican-Ames,-lean voters ? and there ere no such
findings in the record.

In fact the district court eculd

only conclude that Messican-American voters might suffer
restriction in access under the single-member district plan.
The record that we presented to the court indicates
that in a single-member district plan? such a's the ones we
proposed? a district? District Ko. 2? would contain approad.\

stately ona-fchird Mescican-American population?" and as such
Mese ican-Aaaericano practicing the politics ©f coalition? as the
court of appeals called it? would have far greater input into
the ©lection of members of the council than they would when
they comprised only 8 to 10 percent of the population.

In

fact? we presented to the court a witness ? a Mexican-American
by the name of Robert Medrano? who had run at large for a
school board ©sat and lost and then when they changed to an

36
all single-member district plan, had won in a seat that was
approximately evenly divided between blacks * Mexican-American©
and white voters, therefor© demonstrating in the only factual
demonstration in the record that Mexican-Americans could in
fact win in single-member district circumstances*
QUESTION

Does that prove any more than what has

2

been said in some opinione ©f the courts that people do not
necessarily indulge always in block voting?
If they find a candidate attractive* they will vote
for him as such?

That’s what indicates the reason for half

a dozen Negro mayors in the United States in large cities*
does it not?
MR. JOHNSTONs
QUESTIONS

It does* in fact* Mr» Chief Justice.

They -voted for the man, not on a racial

basis.
MR, JOHNSTONs

However, the record as developed in

\

the trial of tMe cause from ©very expert witness indicates
that in the city of Dallas we have the unfortunate situation
/■/

where block voting along racial lines is the rule* and any­
thing else is the exception*
QUESTION *

It also shows that when the primary case

was won in April 14* 1944* all of the Negroes in Dallas were
a solid block* and by election time they had split into
four different groups*
MR. JOHNSTOM s

Weil* the —

3?
QUESTIONS

That’s what the record shows, four groups*

Audi that was about five months, wasn’t it?
MR. JOHNSTONs

The record will also show in this

case that since the institution of the 8-3 plan ordered by
the district court, there has not been a Mexican-Amerloan
candidate elected to the City Council of the city of Dallas.
Previously there had been one, but sins® this time, although
they have run, I think the record will indicate that non© of
the® have won more than a third of the vote and therefore have
i

failed in their efforts to be sleeted at large.
The court itself acknowledged in its opinion that
at-larg© voting might operate in part -as a restriction of the
access of American voters, and we think there is simply no
evidence to support them as unusual circumstances*
Finally, we address briefly the issue of whether or
not a city-wide viewpoint can also foe an unusual circumstance*
W© point to the court’s ©pinion last term in Connor v. Finch
where this Court indicated that a historic policy in multimember districts was not a sufficient reason to uphold multimember districts.

And in Wallace v. House itself, the Court

of Appeals originally attempted to justify a single at-large
seat among five on grounds that they’re avoiding ward parochial
ism contention subsequently rejected on remand.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER BUSCEMI, ESQ. ,
CM BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT AS AMICOS CURIAE
MR. BUSCEMI:

Mr. Chief Justice# my it please the

Court s

I would like to begin by saying that I think Mr.
Justice Stewart is correct in suggesting that this Court has
never found at-large :• municipal elections to be unconstitu­
tional.

This Court in East Carroll Parish Sqhoolboard v.

Marshall# however, did find that the district ''court in ordering at-large elections, hot only the East Carroll Parish
Schoolboard but also for the Parish jury, which is the local
legislative body# had violated the remedial principle that
this Court has sot out in numerous r©apportionment cases# all
of the® beginning with one-man, one-vote violations.
QUESTIONs

As this case did not.

MR. BUSCEMI®

That’s right.

39

In addition to the East Carroll case, this Court has
recognised in Dush v, Davis and in Dallas County, Alabama v.
Reese that there is the possibility that at-large municipal
©lections, local elections, either county or city, may result
in fch® minimisation or the canceling out, to use the Court8s
words, of the votes of particular identifiable minority groups.
QUESTIONS

Well, that’s always true whan you have

an election fey majority rule.

If a municipality is 55 percent

Democratic, the votes of the Republicans are going to be can­
celled out»
MR. BUSCEMI2

True, and that’s the basis of fch©

Court's holding in Whitcomb v. Chaves, where the Court found
that there was no restriction of access by blacks to the
political process, but that the blacks were primarily Demo-'
crat, there were lots of Republicans in Indiana, and the
Republicans won a lot of elections, and as a consequence of

that there were very few black© that were elseted to the
State Legislature from Marion County, Indiana.
what the district court found in this ease.

That is not.

I think the evi­

dence supports the findings, of the district court,
QUESTIONi

Don’t you think there’s a difference at

‘v

least from the point of view of political structure and
political science between a board of county commissioners or
a county jury or whatever it may be called in various states
on the on© hand, or a school board on the same side on the

4 Cl

one hand, and a small city council elected at large with a
city manager system in a home rule municipality on the other?
MR» BUSCEMIs

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, there may

very well he a difference there, and we are not contending
and respondents are not contending —
QUESTION:

matically he 'transferred from one to the other?

not really involve a constitutional rule.

QUESTICHs

Well, at least right at the threshold,

it involves whether at-large municipal elections are — if
there’s any defect in them at all, doesn’t it?

Parish police jury.

Your position is that even though ws were

to conclude if presented with the issue on the merits that an
11 man at-large city.council would not be unconstitutional the
district, court simply should have dismissed the complaint.

In

this cases w© should nevertheless affirm the 5th Circuit which
held that three at-large members were improper remedially?
,

. .MR. BUSCEMIi

Weil, I think the only ''Issue before

the Court is whether the remedy was improper.

Mow, as Mr,

■Justic© Stewart suggests, if the Court finds that at large

42
elections may be ordered as a remedy* the Court ~ because the
Court does not believe there is any constitutional violation
involved in all 11 being elected at large* then presumably the
Court would not need to affirm.

But our suggestion here is

that the violation that was found was indeed a violation and
that the appropriate remedy for a court-ordered reapportion­
ment plan involves single-member districts.
New* as the district court pointed'out* Dallas is
completely free to present the 8-3 plan to the district court
for the District of Columbia or to the Attorney General for
preclearancs under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.

MR. BUSCEMI s

1 think that if there had been such

a submission, the Attorney General would have reviewed it
under Section 3.
I jest want to comment briefly on the special cir­
cumstances that ware noted by' the District Court.

First of

all, those circumstances were noted in the context of an
evaluation of the 8-3 plan, in the context of an evaluation
of the constitutionality of the 8-3 plan.

The District Court

never said that it was talking about special circumstances ©r

j

unusual situations that this court has referred to in speaking
of departures from the single member district preference in
court-ordered remedies.

The District Court did not make such

a finding, and indeed, the special circumstances cited by the
District Court in connection with its assessment, of the plan's

43
constitutionality are far different from the special circumstances noted by this Court on the only occasion rhen this
Court approved multi-member districts in a court-ordered plan.
Shat was in Mahon v. ?owoil, where you had a very special
situation involving the Norfolk Naval Base.
QUESTION §

Do you think it makes any difference in

this connection between a city such as Dallas* which has had
at-large voting since .1907e and the parish in Louisiana that
had had at-large voting only since 1SS8‘?
MR. BOSCEMXs

Nell» 1 think that may very wall make

a difference with respect to whether at-large voting is use­
ful in the city or whether it is constitutional.

I don't

think it should make a difference on what a court-ordered
reapportionateat plan should involve.

ME. BUSCEMI«

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

During the luncheon recess I have obtained some information on the Court’s question on the application of the
Voting Rights Act to the /stat® of Texas and changes that oc-

I .

curred between November 197-2 and September 1975.

:■

Th© Attorney

General has received hundreds of submissions involving such
changes both from Texas itself and from localities within the
state.

Some of those changes, wo are informed, did involve

changes in polling place locations, in answer to Mr. Justice
Brennan^s question.
Indeed, during the 12 months immediately following
the application of the. Voting Rights Act to Texas, more sub­
missions were received from that on© state alone —
QUESTION?

I don’t doubt it.

(Laughter.)
.MR. BUSCEMI 3

—* than from all the other areas

covered under the Act combined.
QUESTI®! t

Do you still contend that this case is

subject to Section 5 submission?
MR. BUSCEMI§

Well, th® relevance of this point to

this case is if an ordinance, if the city council could have
under state law reapportioned itself by ordinance, and if ®*mh

si
•an ordinance had been passed, and

the $-3 plan was now ef­

fective by virtue of a city council ordinance, then that or­
dinance would have to b© submitted.
QUESTIONi

Weil, Mr* Buscemi, why didn't you answer

the Chief Justice yas?

Merely from the fact that it was April

197S, after the *75 coverage, that the ordinance finally becase© legal, when it was approved at the referendum?

stamping what the court' ordered?
MR, BO SC EMI s

Ro, the. city was not,. ' But in Connor

v, Waller, this Court held that an enacted plan that just re­
produces the terms of court■ ordered plans is; subject to preclearance.
QUEST I® s

In effect, then, you're saying that th©

52

judge8s action is indirectly subject to review by the Attorney
General?
MR. BUSCEMIs

No, we’re saying if the state legisla­

tive body . ’or the local legislative body decidas to adopt
what a court, has ordered into effect, then it's subject to pre­
clearance and that is entirely different because there are
different -QUESTION s

Does he have any choice about it?

MR. BUSCEMI?
QUESTION s

Excuse me?

Does the city have any choice about it?

MR, BUSCEMIs

Absolutely.

The city had no obliga­

tion whatsoever to enact the 0-3 plan.

They could have en­

acted any plan they wanted and submitted it to the District
Court of the District of Columbia or the Attorney General for
pre-clearance, and there is currently pending in this Court a
jurisdictional statement in Mo, 771376, United States v.
Georgia, in which a three judge court did consider a submis­
sion of a change occurring between November ’64 and the appli­
cation, and, the effective date of the Voting Rights Act,
August 965, and'saying that that change was covered but saying
that it had been pre-cleared.
The issue in the case is whether the Attorney
General had pre-cleared it.

anything further?
ORAL ARGUMENT BY JOSEPH G. WERNER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL
MR. WEINERt
QUESTION s

Very briefly, Your Hmor,
Will you address this question of pre­

clearance before you finish, Mr. Werner, particularly in
light of the referendum in April 876 after Texas was brought
under this?
MR. WERNER?

Yes.

In response to the question by Mr. Justice PoWell,
X believe you asked does it make a difference that we've had
at large voting since 1907, I believe you asked that question
'

o£ Mr. Johnstons

r

Looking at Mr. Justice Blackmun8s opinion

in the Chapman casa, I gat the feeling that this theory is
based on a deference to state action and that what is really
A

critical here is whether the federal courts are imposing some
system of elections on a state which is contrary to established
state policy.

j
, "j
• • • j

Now, if that is what we're really dealing with hare,
I think it's clear that the use of at large votihg in Dallas
I

.

*

city elections is clearly established state policy, both for
.
;

L

*

the state of Taxas and the city of Dallas, and/that there is

i
no affront to the sovereignty of the state of Texas by virtue
of this federal court order which either orders or approves
the us© of at-large voting.

54!
We had places — what we're dealing with hers are
places with 9, 10 and 11 on -the city council, those places 9,
10 and 11 were at-large places beginning with the charter of
1968, was when, we went from 9 to 11 members, so places 9, 10
and 11 remain absolutely unchanged since 1968.

Furthermore,

as you — direct response to your question, Mr. Justice
Powell, wa have had at large voting generally since 1907 and
that, of sours®, was instituted in the city of Dallas before
we had home rule, and it was done by act of the Texas Legisla­
ture in 1907.
since 1907.

So we've had it continuously in various forms
We've had it in our charter with respect to

these exact three positions on the council since IS68, and I
think there's absolutely no question that this at-large vot­
ing — and of course, it's the at-large voting that we're
arguing about here today, that's in contention — and clearly
the federal court did not impose at-large voting contrary to
established state policy.

So I see no reason to invoke the

East Carroll rule in this situation.
Mow, Mr. Justice Brennan, with respect to the sub­
mission of the charter amendment under Section 5, I think very
clearly the literal language of the statute requires pre- clearance.

Now, the only problem that we sa© with this is

that as we all recognise, whether this is a court-ordered plan
or whether if is a court-approved plan, the federal district
judge has indicated his approval of the plan and so if we come

S3
to the point where we submit the plan to the district court of
the District of Columbia» I think we're submitting in affect
the approval of the local district judge to the further appro»
val of the District Court of the District of Columbia.
QUESTIONS

Or alternatively, the approval of the

Attorney General of the United States'?

V
MR. WERNERj

Yes.

And 1 think, and the reason why

I think this is significant is that I really don't 'think this
is what the Congress had in mind.

Of sours®, in the Sheffield

case the Court construed the intent of the Congress in enact­
ing Section 5, and X really don't think that what the
Congress meant t© do was to have the District Court of the
District of Columbia or the Attorney General review something
that had already been sanctioned by the —
QUESTIONi

At the time the judge initially passed on

the resolution, Tessas was not subject to the Voting Rights
Act?
MR. WERNERs
QUESTION s

No, sir.
He was then free to pass on the consti­

tutionality of this substitive, whereas today if that had been
subject to Section 5, he would not have been free to address
the constitutionality of this, if he considered this to be a
legislative submission, because that would first have had to
go under Section 5.
MR. WERNERS

Yes, sir, and X think there's a

5S
difference hers between what the District Court did — basic-»
ally we had ourselves a 14th Amendment lawsuit in the District
Court,, the local District Court, and I think Section 5
clearance is more closely aligned with 15th Amendment problems.
QUESTION i

Did any of the parties to this action in

their, as opposed t© amicus curiae, raise the Voting Rights
Act issue?
MR. WERNER?

Tli© respondents raised it in the 5th

In his favor.
Yes, sir.
Tell me, Mr. Werner, I gather from what

you -say at least no decision has yet been made by Dallas
whether or not to submit?
MR. WERNER;

Well, until very recently, until

Sheffield was decided we didn't think we had to submit any­
thing, frankly, and we did submit some polling place changes
and things like that over the last couple of years, because we
were afraid if we had to pick that up, if Sheffield were de­
cided against us, we ware afraid that administratively it would

5?
just bo too mush, so we went ahead and submitted those, but we
didn't submit the charter amendment for two reasons.

On© was

the question that the Court just settled in Sheffield and the
other was that' we weren't sure about this question of whether
it was, the fact that the District Court had indicated some
approval about it.
QUESTIONi
MR, WERNER s

¥©S«

But to try to clarify my point about

the effect of what the local district judge has don© hare, I
don t think that just the fact that the local district judge
has approved the plan on soma points and possibly not on the
substantive issues required by the Voting Rights Act neces­
sarily means that we don91 have to submit it.

What troubles

us in this respect is that we don't really think that that’s
what the Congress intended to do.

I think what the Congress

intended to do was to prevent evasions and regressions that
some of the Southern states had resorted to in th© way of
court decisions.

In other words., th© court would invalidate

a certain electoral device and then just as a dodge or an
evasion, th© local government body or the state would resort
to some other change,
2 think clearly that’s not what's happened here, and
so although as I readily concede we’re covered under the
literal language of Section 5, I’m not sure we're included in
the Congressional intent-,

QUESTION s

Do you think the Section 5 issue is here

at ail?

MR. WERHERs

It was not treated in either of the

courts below * Hr. Justice.
QUESTION*

tod it couldn’t have arisen in the dis­

trict court?
MR. WERNERS
QUESTIONS

No, sir.
It's quite possible, I suppose you're

telling us, that a. plan approved by a court can be permissible
as a plan that has been initiated by a legislative body even
though the initiation by the legislative body Joes not amount
to legislation as such, and that even therefore if it's not a
court devised' plan, and can permissibly bs something other
than v»hat a purely court devised plan could be.
Nonetheless, it's a court approved plan and there­
for® might immunise ifc from the necessity of submission under
Section 5, if lator adopted by way of a charter amendment,
which this on© was.
MR. WERNERs

I'm saying.

Well, no, sir, it's not exactly what

What I'm saying is that I can hypothesize the

situation where a district court would approve a plan on
grounds other than something that would satisfy fch© Voting

39
Rights Act.

The district court might not really address it­

self to what I regard as issues more closely related to the
15th Amendment, and still in a eas® like this, approve a plan
which «as challenged only on 14th Amendment grounds.
So what JJm saying is, I don’t think th® local dis­
trict court necessarily covers all the issues that would be
covered in a submission to th® Attorney General,
