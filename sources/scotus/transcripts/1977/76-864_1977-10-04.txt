MR * CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 76-864, City of Lafayette, Louisiana and City of
Plaquemine, Louisiana, against Louisiana Power and Light
Company.
Mr. Hochberg, you may proceed when you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEROME A. HOCHBERG, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. HOCHBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The question presented by this case is whether
cities, political subdivisions of states, are subject to
causes of action and trouble damage liability under the
federal antitrust laws.
We are here on a writ of certiorari and the case
arises out of a complaint filed by the Petitioners, the
Cities of Lafayette and Plaquemine, charging the Respondent,
Louisiana Power & Light Company, two other investor-owned
utilities and the parent of LP&L with violations of the anti­
trust laws in the generation, transmission and distribution of
electric power anc energy.
LP&L, in turn, filed a counterclaim charging the
Cities with antitrust violations in the conduct of the Cities*
electric utility systems.

The Cities moved to dismiss in the

Listrict Court on the ground that Parker v„ Brown barred any

4
action under the federal antitrust laws against them.

The

District Court, relying on Parker, granted the motion and
entered judgment pursuant to Rule 134(b) of the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure against LP&L0

LP&L then appealed to the

Fifth Circuit and during the pendency of that appeal this
Court came down with the Gold fa rb ruling»

The Fifth Circuit

then reversed the District Court, relying on Gold fa rb, and
said that the cities were not automatically outside the scope
of the antitrust laws and that in order to corae within the
state Action doctrine they would have to have had legislative
approval for the specific conduct under challenge.

Certiorari

was granted by this Court after a petition by the Cities.,
The Cities operate their electric utility systems
they own and operate them — pursuant to broad statutory
authority from the Louisiana Legislature»
What is involved here is not whether Cities are
beyond the law but simply whether Cities, as governmental
bodies,^- wholly governmental bodies — are subject to the
antitrust laws and the trouble damage judgments that come
with them for conduct engaged in by City officials in.the
official performance of their duties.

In addition, we are not

here just talking about electric utility service for the Cities
we are talking about the myriad of services and operations that
Cities engage in.
In order to make this determination, it seems to me,

5
this Court has said in Parker_v, Brown that because the
statute itself does not answer the question in specific
words * that we must look to the statutory purpose* the legis­
lative history* the subject matter*, in the context of the
statute„
I think we should also look to the adverse effects*
severe adverse effects* from enforcement of these laws against
City officials and City governments and the impingement that
it will create on a fundamental policy in this country* the
policy of local choice in ordering social and economic needs
and providing local choice on governmental matters closest to
the people.
In Parker* this Court unequivocably stated in broad
language that the statutory purpose of the Sherman Act was to
curb concentrations of private economic power.

The Court

stated that it was clear through pages of legislative history
that the Congress was aiming at private Individuals and business
corporations.

And* of course* at that time* there were the

great sugar trust* the oil trust and the railroads running
rampant and that was the basis for the legislation.

The Court

further said that there was not a hint in the legislative
history of a purpose or effect to apply these laws to state
government* state officials or agents of states,
Thirty-four years have gone by since that decision
and that clear message and Congress has not seen fit to alter

6
the decision or the principles that underlie it.

And I submit

that cities as well as state agents and state officials come
within the purview of that decision* for cities are but
political subdivisions of states to whom the state delegates
power that it gets from the people as a state for the more
convenient and effective governance of the people at a level
closer to them.

In addition* cities* like states* only act

for public purposes not for private gain.
QUBSTIJN:

Let's suppose a city or* make It more

comprehensive* a state* the State of Louisiana* organized an
airline* with fifty or seventy-five airplaneswith the usual
pattern of airline operations and then engaged in monopolistic
or price, fixing or other statutory violations.
What would be your view of that?
MR. HOCHBERG:

X would say that that would not be

subject to antitrust attack.

However* it might be subject to
«

other remedies under the Constitution and the commerce power.
Ancl the Congress, of course* through the commerce power* could
enact legislation to perhaps deal with it.
QUESTION:

If it was entirely intrastate do you think

they could* too?
MR. HOCHBERG:

If it affected interstate commerce

I believe they could*, yes,
QUESTION:

Let me change the question a little bit.

Suppose a city conspired with a private entity.

Isn't there

7
language In Parker itself to suggest that a city is then liable
under the antitrust laws?
MR. HOCHBERG:

I know the one that you refer to,

Mr, Justice Blackmun, and X think just the opposite*

X think

that that language appears in a list of three kinds of conduct
in which the Court in Parker was saying the state could not
immunize persons from — they could not authorize illiegal
activity by individuals and corporations*
endorse it.

They could not

And a private person who conspired with a govern-

mental body would not be immune from antitrust prosecution.
And I say that because those three items are
mentioned in a discussion in the opinion dealing with the
defendants who were private members «-•» who were private
individuals, the growers and the handlers who were operating
the raisin program under the supervision of the State Pro­
rate Commission.

The defendants who were the Prora.te

Committee, as opposed to Commission, were private persons.
And those comments by the court were made in the context of
what was being described that the private parties were engaging
in under state supervision,

bo X think it is just the opposite

X might add that at that point the Court in Parker also seemed
to equate a state with a city, in that statement.
New there are severe consequences, it seems to me,
from applying laws which were aimed at private enterprise to
government.

For example

3
QUESTION:
there may be

Are you going «— Is your submission that

there is absolute antitrust immunity for all

municipal governments in respect of municipal conduct by
officials of the municipality?
MR„ HUCHBRRG:

Well, my position is that the law

absolutely does not apply to cities,

It is not a question of

immunity but that Congress never intended.to apply it to them,
QUESTION:

In any event, that the Pa rke ■-Brown

principle applies to municipalities as it would to state
governments, is that it?
MR* HCCHBERG:
QUESTION:

That's correct. Your Honor,

And no exceptions of any kind?

MR* HOCHBERG:

No exceptions unless Congress sees fit

to change that*
Applying these laws would have
QUESTION:

May I just ask, for example, I know in the

city in which I was born we have a very substantial parking
operation, underground parking area,and around the city and
all the rest, and much complaint by competitors, private
parking, for instance, framed as antitrust charges*

You don't

suppose there is any exception for that sort of thing?
MR* KCCEB.;rg:

There is a remedy for those private

parking
QUESTION:
applies to ««

But you don't think Parker and Brown

9
MR0 HGCHBBRG:
Your Honor.

1 believe it does, that 8s correct,

Rather than use the antitrust laws, there are

political remedies and state law remedies if the public feels
that what the city is doing, what government .is doing at their
behest is not appropriate and not consistent with public
policy.
QUESTION:

You wouldn't inquire whether what the

city did is authorized by a .state statute or by the state
constitution or anything else, just as long as the city is
doing it?
MR0 HCCHBERG:

Thafc8s correct, but of course if they

weren't doing it pursuant to the constitution or state statute
there would be a remedy of state law*
QUESTION:

I know*

I understand that, but your

answer still though is whether legal or illegal under state
law the antitrust law doesn't apply*
MR. HUHBERG: That's right, but right here we have
authorization ■=■»
QUESTION:

I know, but your position is that whether

it is legal or illegal under state law the antitrust law
doesn't apply.
QUESTION:

That’s a rather hypothetical question,

isn't it, whether it's legal or illegal under state law, because
if you were to say that Parker v. Brovin did not operate in thac
situation what you would have is a federal district court in an

10
antitrust suit deciding a matter of state municipal corporation
law,
MR, HOCHBERG:

1 am not sure whether he would be

deciding that, but he would certainly be intruding on the
operation of municipal government and second guessing the city,
and thereby also second guessing the state legislature which
could certainly do something about it if they .had a mind to,
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose the argument would be

that the state legislature didn't give the city the authority
to do that,
MR, HOCHBERG:

Well, then, it seems to me if you are

talking about antitrust prosecution it would not matter under
our condition.
For trouble damage liability to be hanging over the
heads of city officials and city government would have the
effect of making every city official fearful and timid in
conducting the business of the city.

And precisely what we

need right now in city government, in any local government, is
decisiveness not inhibition and timidity.

Indeed, if judg­

ments were entered, it could bankrupt some cities.

And, most

important of all, whether it bankrupted them or not it would
have to be paid, the judgment would have to be paid by the
taxpaying citizens of the city, not from risk-bearing equity
owners, as is the case in private corporations,
QUESTION:

How many cities are running institutions

like this?
MR* HXHBERG:
Your Honor,

Somewhere beetween 1,700.-.and 2,000,

It's a very prevalent mode of delivering electric

service through municipally owned systems,
QUESTION:

Seventeen hundred?

MR, HOCHBERG:

Somewhere close to 2,00G? Between

1,700 and 2,000, it is my understanding,
QUESTION:

Any big cities?

MR, HOCHBERG:
I believe.

Los Angeles, for one,

Part of Cleveland,
QUESTION:

San Antonio,

Many small towns, however, too,

I thought it was mostly small towns,

MR, HOCHBERG:

Cities engage in a wide range of

activities and deliver a wide array of services in this day and
age.

Cities don't just deliver electric service.

They operate

hospitals, they collect garbage, deliver water, they provide
police protection, they provide schools, they operate sports
authorities and public parks and recreation.

They do numerous

And in all of these things they operate their govern»

And that has long

For example, they issue zoning rules and vari­

ances which could affect the competitive ability of businesses
to function properly in their locations.

They grant franchises

QUESTION:

How about athletic franchises, when a city

tries to get a ball club to move to its community?

Is it

acting in a competitive way or noncompetitive way?
MR0 HCCHBERG:

Well, I don't believe the city owns

or franchises that ball club, Mr. Justice Stevens.
QUESTION;

Suppose it did.

Sometimes, 1 think, they

do»
MR. SVCHBERGs

Well, .1 would suppose if they actually

franchise it like they franchise a garbage collection company
to collect garbage in the city then my principle would apply
equally.
QUESTION;

I realize your principle would apply, but

would you still say they are not engaged in any kind of a
competitive activity when they seek to pursuade a ball club
to move to one city rather than another, as an example?
MR. HOCHBfiRG:

Well, they may be competing with

sister cities, but I don't think that is subject to the anti­
trust laws.
If they choose to deliver the services themselves
instead of franchising it, they may exclude all competition if
they so desire or they may leave some competition in the city,
perhaps mass transit competition rather than just exclusive

operation by the governmental authorities.

Or, for example*

cities can combine with their brother cities to induce lower
prices from suppliers.

Indeed* that was precisely what was

charged in New Mexico v, American Petrofina* the Ninth Circuit
case which supports my position completely,
public purposes for all of these things.

There may be

And* indeed* in New

Mexico* there was,
All of these approaches differ from antitrust
concepts „
QUESTION:

What if the state sets up a power district

which is a municipal corporation but doesn't have any of the
governing powers that a city ordinarily has* would your
principle exempt it too?
MRo HOCHBSRG:

My principle, Mr. Justice Rehnquist*

is that if it is a wholly governmental body* as opposed to a
private party or a private party given some self-regulatory
functions* but private primarily because it is engaged in
operations for pecuniary benefit.
state bar,

For example* the Virginia

Those lawyers had private interests at stake and

they were just delegated limited functions by the state of a
self-regulatory nature,

ho I would draw the line at exclusively

governmental bodies.
If antitrust laws were to apply* given the way in
which city operates in franchising and delivering services I
have just described* there could be a flood of new litigation

14
in the courts, particularly a flood of trouble damage litigation
by every disgruntled franchise applicant who thought he was
the victim of a conspiracy between the city and the winning
franchise holder,
QUESTION:

Not only a franchise holder, the winning

vendor of any commodity, such as parking meters, Wouldn't that
be true?
MR0 HOCHBERG:

That's correct.

Or in the Duke case

in the Third Circuit which \*jas against us, it was a beer
company who wanted to sell beer in Three Rivers Stadium and
apparently did not get the franchise, someone else did,
QUESTION:

Suppose in one city there is a municipal

electric company supplying the power for the community and
in a neighboring city there is a city franchise, a private
company, and it is the only company they franchise, let into
the city.

So it has in effect a monopoly.

And then the'

private company in the one city and the adjoining city conspire
together to exclude competition.

They are doing something that

everybody would concede 'would violate the antitrust laws and
they get sued for it.

One of them, you would say, would not be

exempt and the other one is.
MR. HOCHBERG:

Is that correct?

That's correct, Justice White.

As I say, every disgruntled franchise applicant is
going to be a potential trouble damage claimant.

Indeed, every

private business that covets the market that the city now

15

occupies in delivering services would also be a potential
trouble damage claimant.

And it wouldn't matter whether their

claim was valid or not,, but threat of the litigation or the
actual filing and having to fight it would be severe» and all
done by the rule of trouble damages I would suspect»
Now even with Respondent here and the various
amici, particularly the Justice Department as amici, recognize,
it seems to me, that there are some problems when you are
talking about city government and applying laws like the anti­
trust laws to them, for they all try and draw lines to exclude
certain conduct from the reach of the antitrust laws and in­
clude others.

For example, all of them seem to want to draw

a line between proprietary and governmental functions, a line
that has been discredited in the past and rejected by this
Court in numerous cases, most recently in the Indian Towing
case in 1950, I believe, and a line which the lower court,
the court below, the Fifth Circuit, equally rejected.

The

problem there is well described by Mr, Justice Frankfurter in
his opinion in Indian Towing.
In addition, the Justice .Department proposes a
regulatory nonregulatcry line.

And that line, it seems to me,

just like proprietary governmental, won’t wash because, to give
you an example, if the Cities franchise someone else to deliver
a service and instructed it, the private entity, to conduct
itself antlcompetitively, the City would not -- under the

16
Justice Department test, the City would not be subject to
prosecution under the antitrust laws.

But if the citizens of

the City decide they would rather deliver the service them­
selves, because „aey feel it is more effective that way or
responds to their needs, and did the same thing they had told
the private entitles to do, the Justice Department would want
to sue the City for that.

I submit that makes no sense and

has no logic.
QUESTION:

But you still could go against the

franchise in your first problem, couldn't you?
MR. HOCHBERG:

That might or might not be, it would

depend on whether it came within the test in Cantor or in
Gold fa rb .

That's correct. Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Would you run that by us again, give an

example of what you, the point you
MR. HOCHBERG:
QUESTION:

If the City had a private franchisee

What would be an example of what you are

talking about?
MR. HOCHBERG:
QUESTION:

Transit.

All right.

MR. HOCHBERG:

And instructed the transit company,

the bus company, to operate in a manner inconsistent with the
antitrust laws.
QUESTION:

As a monopoly within the city.

How is

that inconsistent with the antitrust laws to let one transit

17

company operate In the city?
MR, HOCHBERG:

Well, whether that would be or not,

perhaps they would instruct the transit company to conduct
itself, to do certain things that would be considered a
violation of Section 2,
QUESTION:

I submit that for your example to be

persuasive you have to think of something that would violate
the antitrust laws, and you haven't done that yet,
MR, HOCHBERG:

Well, if they instruct the bus

company tc make arrangements with another bus company on the
border that serves the metropolitan area to come up with the
same price for bus service, so citizens in the adjoining
suburb would not howl at the higher price in the city, for
example*

QUESTION:
them:

Your example is the city says to each of

"You two agree on the price — we don't care what it

is — but you agree on the price and charge the same thing»"
As opposed to saying:

"The price in this city for bus fare

shall be 10 cents,"
You are talking about the first example and you
think that should be okay*
MR* HOCHBERG:

No,

I think the city under the

government Ss test would not be subject to prosecution, but
if the city did that, rather than have a private bus system,
the city would be subject to antitrust prosecution.

18

QUESTION:

Your example is that if the city operates

a bus company and agrees with a private bus company in a
neighboring community that "We will both charge $1 a ride*"
then the city should be immune and the other company should be
subject to prosecution*
MR. HOCHBERG:
QUESTION:

That's your example?
That‘s correct,

Or if the city says to outlying suburbs*

"If you don't ride our buses* you can’t get city water*"

That

Is sort of akin to the facts of this case*
MR. HOCHBERG:

One of the charges.

charges-in the counterclaim.
QUESTION:

There are other

That's just one of them*

Makes a tie-in arrangement., in other

words *
MR. HOCHBERG:

Right.

Under the government's

test if the city told a private entity to engage In that tie*
the government wouldn't be subject to suit* but if the govern­
ment did It then it would be subject to suit*
QUESTION:

You mean the company that did It would

be subject to suit.
MR. HOCHBERG:

Right.

Something like Cantor.

In

Cantor the Public Service Commission wasn't sued and I doubt -»
my feeling is that I don't think this Court would hold the
Public Service Commission subject to antitrust laws for
endorsing that tie*
All of these lines that the city and the Justice

19
Department and the Respondent and the various amici propose
are, It seems to me, totally inconsistent with the Parker
language, with the statutory purpose of the Sherman Act and
with the legislative history of Congress in enacting that law.
The only line, I submit, that is consistent with that legis­
lative history and statutory purpose is when wholly govern­
mental bodies are excluded from the antitrust laws and
private parties, or private parties with self-regulatory
functions granted by the state, would be subject to those
antitrust laws0
The reason I say that is that there is not a hint
in the legislative history that Congress intended to apply the
antitrust laws at some levels of government and not to other
levels of government or to some conduct of government and not
to other conduct of government.
said,

In point of fact, Congress

,:We are passing these antitrust laws to.aim at curbing

private economic power.And there wasn't a hint that <;hey
were aiming thlm at government at any level6
QUESTION:

Is there as bright a line as you suggest

between governmental bodies and nongovernmental bodies -- Let
me go back to my example of a power system that’s authorized
to be formed by the landowners

within a particular geographic

area and to govern itself and to supply power itself by the
state legislature, and it is a nonprofit type of thing.

Now,

I would think of that as a governmental function in many senses

20
/

Yet your answer was* I think, that that would probably be
subject to the antitrust laws.
MR. HOCHBERG:

That's not the issue here today

because there is no question but these are cities and they are
totally governmental.

In that situation., it seems to me* this

Court* or any federal court* would have to make a determination
whether It was truly a wholly governmental body.

Just as this

Court did in NLRB v. Natural Gas Utility

when it had

to determine whether

jjistriet

the district was a political subdivision

of the state so that it came within the exemption of the labor
laws.

And there the Court rejecting* of course* local lav; and

state law as a means of governing whether a federal statute
applied* decided that that district was, indeed* a political
subdivision by looking to various factors* like was it respon­
sible to an elected official or to the legislature ultimately
and things like that.
Again* I say in order to hold Cities subject to the
antitrust laws here — and after ail they are criminal statutes
and It seems to me very doubtful that the Congress would have
enacted the Sherman Law to apply to city governments* being
criminal as they were* without some indication.in the legisla­
tive history that that was what they were intending.
In order to subject Cities to antitrust laws* I
think this Court would have to repudiate the message of Parker
and impute to Congress an intention it never expressed* and to

21
then go about rationalizing the important public policy of
local choice in local governance with the antitrust policy and
throw into that mix in addition a weighing of the severe consequences that might occur from application of these laws., and
put them all together and try and divine a line or several
lines with caveats and subcaveats for holding City subject to
the antitrust laws.
1 submit that —
QUESTION:

On the other hand, you might win on the

trial of this case.
MR, HOCHBERG:

Well, of course, we certainly hope

we will and we think that we very well might, but that's not
really why we are here today.
QUESTION:

I mean all these horribles you are

talking about -- This case was just sent back, wasn't it?
MR, HOCHBERG:

A number of cases, Your Honor, have

just come up through the courts since Goldfarb -QUESTION:

I know.

MR, HOCHBERG:

I know.

We have about five circuit courts

going against us now,
QUESTION:

But the point is that this one has been

sent back,
MR. HOCHBERG;

My feeling is that if this Court were

to put together that mix of rationalizing the various policy
conflicts that exist here and the consequences that is the kind

22
of a procedure which requires careful investigation and review
and analysis, most appropriate to a legislature and not to this
Court .
Isd like to reserve the rest of my time.
QUESTION:

May I ask you a question before you sit

down.
What do we do with the language in Cantor and
Goldfarb that requires a command or a direction from a state?
MR. HQCHBERG:

That language is perfectly appropriate,

Mr. Justice Powell, 'when a private entity is being sued, as was
the case in Goldfarb and in Cantor, because the antitrust laws
were clearly aimed at private enterprise and private economic
power.

Therefore, a careful scrutiny is necessary, it seems to

me, to make sure that the state has indeed instructed those
private entities to do what they are doing.

Absent that state

instruction, it seems to me, the antitrust laws apply across
the board.
QUESTION:

You say that here it-is just as * though

the state had done it because the City is the state,
MR. HQCHBERG:

The equivalent of the state in terms

of the fact that they are a politica:!, subdivision to which the
state grants its powers.

In addition, because there is no

legislative history that the Congress intended to treat them
differently.
QUESTION;

There are instances in the federal law

23
where cities were treated differently than states.
MR. HGCHBERG:

There are.

In the Eleventh Amendment

they are treated differently and in the Fourteenth Amendment
they are treated the same, In terms of state action.

The fact

of the matter is in each situation, constitutional or statutory,
you have to look at the statutory purpose or the constitutional
purpose in the context., as Parker said.

And when you examine

that, it seems to me that the statutory purpose here was aimed
at private economic power and not government of any sort.
QUESTION:

What do you suppose Congress* purpose

was, as you interpret the statute?
MR, HOCHBERG:

To curb private economic power.

That was what was going on in 1890 when the Sherman Law was
passed.
QUESTION:

What do you suppose the Intention was in

excluding, implicitly excluding states and cities?
MR. HOCHBERG:

I think they probably never even

thought of it, Justice White, but because they weren't even
thinking about going after governments. They were concerned
with private entities.

Given the fact that they were so

definitely concerned with private economic power and that was
the purpose of their law, absent a clear intention to include
government, it seems to me it is up to Congress to remedy that
after the Parker case, and given the situation in 1890 it is
up to Congress to change that.

24

QUESTION:

So you just think this is an example of

ordinary rule of construction: You just don't apply statutes
to a sovereign unless there is some clear indication of it.
Is that it?
MRoHOCHBERG:
QUESTION:

That•s correct.

In Louisiana, would this apply to the

police juries in the parishes?
MR, HOCHBERG:

I believe' so. Your Honor, parishes,

of course, are governmental bodies, wholly governmental bodies.
QUESTION:

I said the police jury of the parish.

MR, HOCHBERG:
full details of it.

I am not really familiar with the

It might be or It might not, I just don't

know o
QUESTION:

Back in the 1890's wasn't municipal

ownership thought of as one of the safeguards against monopoly?
MR, HOCHBERG:

I believe electric Utility got started,

in many ways, when municipalities provided it for their citi­
zens before private power got into the picture,
QUESTION:

Wasn't that the philosophy that was

thought to"'undergird the TVA development?
MR, HOCHBERG:

That's correct.

Government has always

got to be eventually answerable to the people, and the check
of the political process is available.

And that's a remedy

which is far preferable than applying antitrust laws aimed at
private parties to the cities.
Thank you.

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Carter,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW P. CARTER, ESQ.
FOR THE RESPONDENT
MR, CARTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I am Andrew Carter from New Orleans, Louisiana, here
representing Louisiana Power and Light Company, often referred
to as LP&L
I have deeded five minutes of my time to one of
the amicus and I hope I won't regret it with my slow talk.
1*11 try my best to make it through on time.
If it please the Court, the Cities' counsel here has
glossed over the four allegations of antitrust conduct and I
believe that taking up one of those examples might furnish the
Court a little understanding with why LP&L is bothered here.
LP&L is primarily a rural electric utility company
engaged in furnishing service in 46 of the 64 county areas
which we call parishes.

In those parish areas there are some

cities and towns and some of those cities and towns have
electric, gas and water systems.

In recent years, they have

been going into the outlying areas with their water, gas and
electric services and we run into the proposition now more
often increasingly where the cities will tell customers op­
petentia! customers that in order for them to get water and
gas they will have to take their electricity.

This is done

26

sometimes with a new customer just moving into the area, some
times with one that LP&L is already serving, or a rural elec­
tric co-op, like our friends here on our side of the case.
bo this is a practice, it seems to us, to be a
classic tie-in arrangement and it is one of the things we are
after here to see if we can stop it.
Now I have read the Cities1 briefs, of course, and
1 have listened to counsel today and it seems to me that
counsel is,in due deference to him, adding a great deal to
what he is advancing to call it a principle.

VJhat he is

saying here is simply a superficial proposition that if the
courts lock at the actor involved and they find out that the

)

actor is a state agency or political subdivision then the
inquiry stops right there and you are through right at that
point.

That, makes it quite obvious why counsel didn't talk

about any of the four pertinent cases in this line of juris­
prudence that started with Parker, because every last one of
them shoots down that proposition.
QUESTION:
MR. CARTER:

I think he did talk about them.
Well, he mentioned them, Your Honor.

He gave them his blessing as he passed, but he didn't analyze
them.

And, of course, since they are on my side I want to

analyze them.
QUESTION:

He analyzed them his way, now you want

to analyze them your way.

27
MR» CARTER:

Well, you can look at It that way,

1 think mine is actually an analysis, however,
because what I want to do is go into each one with the basic
content of what happened in that case*
Now the first one, I am sure this Court has heard
so much about it it *s ad nauseum on Parker v ,__Brown, but in
that case you will recall that the actors there were your
state officials and some private individuals who had been
made state agents for the purpose of this raisin proration
program.

And the activity there was the administration of

that raisin proration program.

And what did this Court do?

This Court looked right at what was going on as to the
activity.

It found out that the activity had been mandated,

had been compelled by the state, through its sovereign exercise
of the legislature.

So it. held that, there was a state exemption.

3 think one sentence Is the key to the holding in Parker v.

Brown, and it reads this way:

"The state in adopting and

forcing the prorate program made no contract or agreement and
entered into no conspiracy in restrain of trade or to establish
monopoly, but as sovereign imposed the restraint as an act of
government which the Sherman Act did not undertake to prohibit,"
So what did they do?

They looked at the activity and

they said that's a sovereign act, mandated activity.
Now, we go along for a number of years and we come
onto 1975 and Gold fa rb „

And in Gol.d'iarb what did we have?

28
We had the state bar and a county bar that were the actors,,
and the activity was a minimum fee schedule for lawyers *
did this Court do there?

What

It didn't just stop with the actor,

the state bar which was found by the Court to be a state agency

by law.

It went beyond that and looked at the activity.

It

found that the activity was not state compelled,,

Jo you get an Implication out of the

QUESTION:

Gold fa rb case that if the Supreme Court of Virginia had
ordered that action it would have been exempt?
MR. CARTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, I think we would have

a base case in that situation, probably.

I don't know all of

the underlying circumstances in either case, but It would very
likely have been a base case and you would have had a sovereign
act of one of the three sovereign branches of government and a
base case in the supreme Court,
way.

it could have worked that

But the fact is that Your Honor, as I recall, was the

organ of the Court and wrote the very words that we rely on
principally here and we think, really, they resolve this 'whole
matter, and I believe the Court stood firmly behind those words
and I just take the liberty of one sentence, actually two
sentences, quote:

"The threshold inquiry in determining if an

anticompetitive activity is state action of the type the
Sherman Act was not meant to proscribe is whether the activity"

The

The legislature simply authorized

MR* CARTER:

Your Honor, I think the legislature

mandated the whole program» and in fact I believe it went into
pretty good detail with It.

Naturally, they couldn't go into

detail as to the particular price on a given day or anything
like that, but —
QUESTION:

That had to be approved by the growers,

didn't it?
MR. CARTER:

Had to be approved by the growers?

I don't think the program had to be. Your Honor.

I think that

perhaps prices at one point or another would have to be.
QUESTION:

I thought the very existence — In other

words, if a majority of the raisin growers voted against that
sort of thing there wouldn’t be any prorating.
MR. CARTER:

Oh, no.

I don't believe

You may be

right, Your Honor, but that's not my recollection of it.
The Chief Justice went on in Goldfarb to say one more
thing: "Here we need not inquire further into the state action
question because it cannot fairly be said that the State of
Virginia through its Supreme Court rules required the anti­
competitive activities of either respondent.”
And to us that is so plain and so clear that it is

30
really a bright line rule.
We come to Cantor
that»

which happened shortly after

What do we see in Cantor?

We see what I believe was a

state action but not a state action case.
by that?

Mow what do I mean

I mean that as the Court pointed out you didn81 have

a state agency or political subdivision that was a party* so
to that extent it wasn't a state action case.

On the other

hand, the Court reaffirmed Goldfarb and applied the rule that
I just read, and determined that the activity

and by the

way the actors there, if you recall, were -- the actor was a
private utility company, Jetroit Edison, and the activity was
their light bulb replacement program.

This Court looked at

that and it determined that that was an activity that was not
state compelled and, therefore, even though there was no state
body involved as a party, it applied the Gold farb-Parker rule
and said Detroit Edison is responsible under the Sherman Act.
QUESTION:

Of course, all of your analysis, so far,

is based upon the premise that the City here, the municipality
here, is the equivalent of the bar association in the Goldfarb
case, the utility in the Michigan case and of the marketing
association in the California case.
If, on the other hand, one takes the view of your
brother that the City is the equivalent of the state itself
then your analysis collapses.
MR. CARTER:

It surely would, Your Honor, but so would

I may use your phrase* the other way too.

All the cases under

the Fourteenth Amendment are.
MR, CARTER:

Well* that's right* Your Honor*, but I

think the state and the city are not to be equated.

that's our position.

any further than that under the very rules that X have been
talking about,
QUESTION:

In other words* Mr. Carter* if the

defendant in this case had been the state of Louisiana which
was in the electric power business* you would concede that they
would not be within the coverage — that if the state would not
be within the coverage at all of the antitrust laws.

And if it was in the electric business, then you would concede

Your Honor, I think that —

Suppose, for example, that city entered

into an agreement with the private parking lot owners to fix
the price uniformly at both municipally operated and privately

Cantor and Bates the answer is that if that parking lot were
not the result of some mandate of the sovereign, some
QUESTION:

It is no more than what I. tell you.

It is

a home rule city and has the broadest possible home rule powers,
MR, CARTER:

Then, Your Honor, they would have to

abide by the antitrust laws, in my opinion.
QUESTION:

Mr, Carter, let me read you this sentence

out of Farcer va Brown at page 3^7 of 317 U.S.

It says:

"If

the proposed program is approved by the Commission, is consented
to by 65$ in number of producers in the zone owning 51$ of the
acreage devoted to production of the regulated crop, the
Director is required to declare the program instituted,"
Now, do you consider that to be a state mandated
program, where it requires the consent of private individuals?
MR, CARTER:

Yes, sir, because I think that the state

directed him on that 65$, the legislative act.

I think what

you just read, that if it got to 65$, under the legislation
he was directed not to act.
QUESTION:

Nell, so, in other words, authorizing

legislation really can be mandatory in your view, so long as

34
the terms of the authorization are complied with,
MR, CARTER:

I think authorizing legislation, Your

Honor, could contain a mandate, taut I think, on the other
hand, you can have authorizing legislation that does not
contain a mandate.

I think that you have to look at what the

legislative act did,

I don't think in every instance —

For example, in Louisiana, our legislative acts permit and
authorize municipalities to engage in the electric business,
They can run their own systems, either within the city limits
or without.

So they are authorized.

But the question here, and I think it will be the
question cn remand if this Court favors us, is going to be
whether that operation of the electric business in the manner
we have charged them with was a state compelled activity,
QUESTION:

Then if the state statute said in any

city in Louisiana where by referendum 60$ of the voters of the
city vote in favor of a municipal electric company the city
shall establish one.

That would meet your definition of

mandated,
MR, CARTER:

Yes, it would.

Yes, it would»

I think

the legislature can act —
QUESTION:

But you would demand that the legislature

go further than that, wouldn't you?

Under my brother Hehnquist’s

example, then that authorizes the city to — when 65# of the
electorate so votes to —-

go into the electric power business.

You would require, as I understand your argument,
that the state legislature also authorizes them to engage in
conduct which, except for this authorization, would violate
t

the antitrust laws .
MRo CARTER:
QUESTION:

Your Honor •—
WouIdn't you?

They already are clearly authorized to be in the
electric business, aren't they?
MR „ CA RTER:
QUESTION:

By the state legislature0

MR, CARTER:

Absolutely,

MR. CARTER:

My test if the Goldfarb test, Your

It is the Goldfarb test that I
It follows Parker.

It accommodates

the Tenth Amendment argument that was made by Attorney General
Warren, later Chief Justice*

It does all that is necessary to

QUESTION:
MR. CARTER:
QUESTION:

Mr. Carter*
Yes, sir.
In Cantor the Public Utility Commission

of Michigan was an agency of the state, was it not?
MR. CARTER:

The Public Service Commission was an

agent of the state, yes, sir.
*

QUESTION: It,was argued in that case that, by virtue
of that fact, there was state action*

That argument was re-

jected by Detroit —
MR, CARTER:' Detroit Edison argued that, Your Honor,
And I think it was obvious from the decision of the court that
the court considered that the mere filing of a rate calendar
at that tine was not state compelled action by the Public
Service Commission,
QUESTION:

The City, in this case, has authority to
*

make rates and to enter contracts and generally operate a
utility independently of the Public Service Commission of the

state,

Does it not?
MR, CARTER:

Your Honor, if I caught your question

correctly, you are asking about the City's authority?
QUESTION:

I am asking about the City's authority to

37
operate an electric utility under the state law.
MR* CARTER:

They, can set their own rates»

They are

not regulated by the State Public Service Commission»
QUESTION:

They are independent of the State Utility

Commission,
MR. CARTER:
QUESTION:

That's right.
-Does the City have authority to operate

the utility that is substantially consistent with the authority
conveyed to the Public Service Commission to supervise the
operation of private utilities?

I am trying to see whether

there is an analogy between the power conferred on the Public
service Commission of the state and that conferred on the City.
MR. CARTER:

Mr. Justice Powell, in Louisiana, the

power of the Public Service Commission to regulate investorowned utility companies and co-op's is what is known as
plenary.

Our power of our commission is plenary.

So, without

trying to be semantical, I'd say that the Cities would have
certainly no more power than that and possibly less.
QUESTION:

Except, of course, the City itself may

own the utility.
MR. CARTER:

Yes, that's right.

That's right,

I see a time signal that causes me to desist from
going further with the Bates case.

I think the Court has

already absorbed my point about these four cases.

The Bates

case just stands right on the same ground with the others.

38
The Court looked at the actor being the state bar and the
activity restraining lawyer advertising, and the holding was
found to be mandated by the sovereign, the Supreme Court of
Arizona.
So I think that what you have here, and I want to
state it in my own way, though it is really the Goldfarb —
QUESTION:

Are you going to leave five minutes for

your colleague?
>1R„ CARTER:

Am I into his time?

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You are not quite into

it yet, bub you are getting close.
MR. CARTER:

I think I can do something in about a

minute here. Your Honor, that I would like to do very much.
Cities* counsel has pitched his whole case on policy.
And I want to throw some policy considerations out to the Court.
What does a consumer outside the City of Plaquemine do when
he could get his electricity cheaper from LP&L or a co~op than
he could from the City?

But he is forced to take it from the

City because that's the only way he can get water and gas.
That doesn't seem to me a good policy.
.QUESTION:
this practice?

_

Mr. Carter, does your counterclaim allege

I didn't think -~

MR. CARTER:

Oh, yes.
It does?
Yes, sir.

We allege a tie.-in.

MR. CARTER:

MR» CARTER:

Of the water, electricity and the gas?
Yes, sir*

The affidavit reflects —

It is not in the counterclaim itself?
Oh, yes.

It is in the counterclaim.

In the second amended counterclaim*
Now, for another policy question»

What happens to the

utility facilities that the power company has placed there to
serve the customers and along comes the City?
Your Honors all know that facilities are what goes
into the rate base and that's the proposition for setting rates
and so, to make this brief, you know that the rate payers, our
customers, end up picking up facilities in the rate base»
I don't think that's a very good consideration»
I think that when you look at the policy considera­
tions counsel has been talking about today he is giving a bunch
of dire consequences that would derive from violations of the
Antitrust Act, but he hasn't addressed a bit of what would be
the dire consequences of abiding by it, like ail the rest of us
have to do.
Thank you, Your Honor*

ORAL ARGUMENT OP WILLIAM T „ C RISP, ESQ.,
AMICI CURIAE, FOR THE RESPONDENT
MRo CRISP:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
First, I want to thank you for indulging me this
time as well as Mr» Carter.

I know you don't look with favor

on friends of yours coming up here and arguing before you»
This will be my first time»
I want to respond, to begin with, to a question put
by Mr. Justice Marshall.

I alluded to Volume 1 of the First

Federal Power Survey in my brief.

The answer to your question

about the number of different types of entities in the industry
in 1962, according to that Volume 1 — and I am referring to
page 17 of it — there were 430 investor-owned companies.
There were 2,124 cities and PU.c's,

There were 969 cooperatives

and 44 federal distributors of power.
Since that time there has been some diminution of
the municipalities and some addition to the electric coopera­
tives .
QUESTION:

In terms of volumes of the 485

about

half the total or three-quarters or one quarter?
MR, CRISP:

There are about 200 ICU’s, Mr. Chief

Justice Burger, who distribute about 93% of the power that is
attributable to the investor-owned part of that segment.
I hope I am being responsive to your question.

41
Two events took place in 1890 without which we
wouldn't be here in this case today,,

This Court, of course,

is familiar with one of them which was the enactment of Sherman*
The other is one that at that time foretold, perhaps, fortuitously, some of the facts that have emerged to give rise to
this proceeding»

For in that year, a line, an electric line,

operating on alternating current was opened to carry 480 kilo»
watts of single-phase power at 4,000 volts and 125 cycles per
second, fourteen miles from Willamette Falls, Oregon, to the
City of Portland»

And it was the first time that it was

demonstrated that there would be economic feasibility for
large unit, central station power in this nation.
It was over 50 years, however, before the rural
segment of our society became accessible to that great tech­
nology»

And that came about in the years immediately after

World War II, as a result of the fact that the Congress in
1936 enacted the Rural Electrification Act»

Its purpose was

to make feasible electric power accessible to every rural
American.

And for all practical purposes, that objective has

been accomp1ished.
I bring to you, in the name of those cooperatives,
what I think is a unique situation, both legally and factually,
that has a bearing on how this Court should rule in this case»
In fact, I say to you, and perhaps this is too strong to start
with, that unless you resolve the issue in our favor, there

42

will remain an untenable legal dichotomy, because of these
particular facts and this particular law that I want to talk
about p
Throughout this country, in most states, the munici­
palities have the power to expropriate going electric business
properties, in most cases, of cooperatives and in some states
of electric power companies*
In Louisiana, they may do it with respect to both the
cooperatives and the power companies, and they have done so many
times *
This, of course, affords a due process just compen­
sation proceeding, whereby there is remuneration for the
resulting damage*
On the other hand, not even in states where such
powers may be statutorily exercised by either a municipality or
a public utility district, may that power be exercised lawfully
if to do so is to substantially impair the national objective
of rural electrification?

Because to do so would be to frus­

trate the Federal Supremacy Clause,
Now, what I am painting for you here is this
dichotomy:

If Louisiana Cities is permitted to prevail in

this case, on the one hand, even in having the power to ex­
propriate our properties, through due process and pursuant to
the Fifth Amendment, they can *t go so far as to destroy our
properties if the result is to impair the remainder of what we

43
do.
Under their theory in this ease* they may piece-meal
and in certain instances blitzkrieg and widespread for- sub­
division purposes, come out and coram it acts which we would be
held not only civilly but criminally accountable for, piece­
meal or widespread, and accomplish precisely the same
results without being redres'sable under the,Sherman Act,
Now, we say just this to you, in conclusion.
is dirty ball.

That 'is unfair.

That

And one tenet,.,I think* all

of us will agree, is a fundamental tenet of construction
is simply this:

That you do not construe a statute if

the result is to be probably unjust, absurd and unfair.

And

that's what we say to you will be the case if you rule as
I

the Cities have asked you to here.
In parting, may I say whether we can agree that this,
is the statutory construction or not, if what the Cities are
doing in their tie-in arrangements, which is a per se violation
of Sherman and Clayton for us, if it is not, verily, men say,
surely If it is not,it ought to be narrowly prohibiting,
