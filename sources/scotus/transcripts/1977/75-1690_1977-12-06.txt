P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 1690, Parham against J. L. and J. R„, Minors.
Mr. Lackey, I think you may proceed.

But before you

proceed, in case you were not in hearing when I announced it,
Mr. Justice Brennan is unavoidably detained for parts of these
cases but will participate in the consideration on decision—
on the record, of course.
You may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. DOUGLAS LACKEY, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. LACKEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
This case comes to this Court from the United States
District Court for the Middle District of Georgia.

At issue is

the constitutionality of the Georgia statute which recognizes
the right of parents and guardians to make application for
admission of their minor children to state mental health
facilities.
This lawsuit is predicated upon two grounds.

The

first ground is teat those children have a constitutionally
protected right to challenge their parents* decisions as to
what medically indicated treatment will be. provided t© children
and that the challenged statute her©, which provides for
neither notice uct hearing before hospitalization deprives them

4
of that right without due process of law.
The

second

ground is thatmentally ill children have

a constitutional right, when they receive treatment from the
state, to receive that treatment only in the treatment setting
which is most appropriate to their condition.
This lawsuit 'was brought: by two boys, age 12 and 13
at the time of this litigation.

Each had been in a state

mental health facility for over five years.

Each had been

admitted under the challenged code section, on® by his parents,
the other by his guardian, a stats agency.
At the time of the trial of the litigation, we
admitted that these two boys as well as 44 other children who
were then in the mental health facility could be treated for
their condition in other facilities which we considered more
appropriate.
Two facts which do not. appear in the record but which
I want to bring to ‘the Court's attention are that on® of the
plaintiffs is now deceased, J. L.

The other is that some of

th.es© children are still in the hospital.
The District Court in essence agreed with the appellees;
on both grounds, finding that in fact the children had a liberty
interest and that they were'deprived of it by the operation of
tills statute, and finally that the children had a substantive
du@ process right which was violated by the operation .of the
statute

5

There are in essence two issues before the Court then.
The first is whether these children are entitled to procedural
due process rights and whether they receive it under the
statute; and the second is whether the children hav® a right*
if they are to receive treatment from the state, to receive
that treatment only in the best facility.
Turning to the first issue—
Q

I thought earlier you had said something to the

effect the request* the demand* was for treatments suitable
to their needs, or something to that effect.

D© you mean that

to be trie same as fch© best treatment available?
MR, LACKEY:

The language that the District Court used

was the treatment setting most appropriate to th© child's
condition, and we interpret that to mean the best, that anything
loss than fell© bast would not be the most appropriate.
Q

Do you read the District Court’s decree as to

the 46 individuals with whom it entered specific instructions
as to placement to foreclose th© state from simply releasing
them entirely?
MR. LACKEY:
Q

address that Issue.
Q

From the parents?

MR. LACKEY:
Q

No, from the state employees,

But. they are not asking for damages against

their parents for tee decisions and actions of fchs parents?
MR. LACKEY:

No, sir.

The parents are not parties

to this lawsuit.
Thera are in essence, with respect to the procedural
due process- issue, three subissues, on® ©f which the Court
itself advanced, that being the question of state action her®.
The other two are the question of whether a child has in fact
a liberty interest in this situation and, if a child doss have
a liberty interest, there is state action, what process is due.
Turning first to th© liberty interest, w© have looked
to th® District Court’s analysis of the case.

Th© District

Court said in essence that children have a liberty interest,
for the Supreme Court of th© United states said so in its
decision in the case of In Re Gault.

Hospitalisation is a

massive curtailment of that liberty for again th© Supreme
Court sale so in Humphrey v, Cady.

Th© District Court than put

•the two together and concluded that these children ware
deprived of a liberty interest without due process of law.
Cur position is that the District Court’s analysis

is flawed because th® District Court focused on th.© wrong
interest.

It is a fendcental dr threshold issue in any

7
litigation

where what is challenged or what is alleged is a

deprivation ©£ a constitutionally protected interest that you
must look t© the interest itself to see whether in fact it can
b© fairly said* as in this case, to fall within the ambit of
the Fourteenth Amendment.
What we suggest to the Court that the interest is
here is the interest in the child to challenge his parents9
medically indicated decision, for -that is exactly what the
District Court is allowing the child to do by asserting that
the child is deprived of a liberty interest by being hos­
pitalized.

it is our position that this

analysis is incon­

sistent with both the inferences that can be drawn from this
Court's opinions, state court decisions# as well as the history
of Western civilisation.
In our civilisation# in our society# we have
determined that children cannot make certain decisions for
themselves.

One of these areas in which ws have mad© this

determination is in tbs area of selecting medically indicated
treatment.

Both at common law and in the case law of this

country we have said that parents select medically indicated
treatment for their children.

Their children do not select

that treatment themselves.
Q

Is there a difference between mental and

ordinary hospital?
MR. LACKEYs

Is there a difference?

Yes# sir# there

!

8
is a difference.
Q

For example, in a mental hospital yon. are

restrained.
MR. LACKEYs

Yes, sir, you ara restrained in a sense.

Thar© is no denying that.

I think the record in this

case

discloses that—
Q

That the parent has a right to restrain the

child.
MR. LACKEY:

A parent has a right to restrain a child

independent of this case.

But I think what the record

discloses hare—
Q

For how long?

MR. LACKEYs

I suppose parents restrain children

until they reach their majority.
Q

You could not restrain the child then from

school.
MR. LACKEY:
Q

So, it is not that broad, is it?

MR. LACKEY;
Q

No, that is correct, you could not.

It is not absolute; of course not.

But you do recognize the difference between the

family's right to see that a child's tonsils ar® taken out as
contrasted to being committed for the rest of his life?
MR. LACKEY:

I can see s. difference in those two

extremes, certainly, Your Honor.

The point I am trying to make

here quite honestly, sir, is that if there is a liberty

s
interest In the child at'all to challenge his parents * decision
to hospitalize him, that liberty interest must cut completely
across the whole- spectrum.

It is not plausible to say that

a constitutional right exists in a child whan the child's
parent, wants to place him in a mental hospital.
Q

I take it you do not suggest—maybe you d©-“

that the parents® consent or decision is sufficient in itself.
MR. LACKEYs

1 am sorry, sir, I did not understand

your question.
Q

Is it your submission that the child lacks a

liberty interest to such an extent that the parents8 decision
standing alone is enough?
MR. LACKEYs

No.

In this circumstance the parents'

decision standing alone is not enough.

In actuality in any

case, where whar ws are speaking cf is medically indicated
treatment, the parents’ decision is not enough.
Q

The state—

What ©is© must there be besides the parents’

decision to hospitalize the child?
MR. LACKEY:

In this specific case there must be th©

concurrence of a physician that what th© parent desires for a
child is actually what is in the child’s best interest.
0

So? somebody should look over the shoulder of

th® doctor and th® parents or net?
MR. LACKEYs

Our position is that no on© should look

over the shoulder of ths doctor and th© parent or th© doctor

10

and th© child.
Q

If they act together.

MR. LACKEY:
Q

If they act together.

MR. LACKEY?
Q

If they act together.

And this physician could be an Obstetrician?

MR. LACKEYS
Q

Pardon m®, sir?

Y@s, sir.

Trained in—

MR. LACKEY:

Th© law in Georgia and in most other

states makes no difference between different practitioners of
medicina.

It simply defines them as physicians,
Q

So, I mean,

an

obstetrician can say that this

chi,Id is dangerous and needs mental treatment.
MR. LACKEY:
th© child is dangerous.

No, sir, he would not have to say that
All he would have to say is that the

chi.Id is mentally ill and suitable for treatment.
Q

He is still an obstetrician.

MR. LACKEY:
Q

Yes, sir, ha could b© an obstetrician.

What is dons in practice as a matter of fact?

Do they use obstetricians for this purpose?
MR, LACKEY:
Q

Ho, sir, they do not.

Going back to this dichotomy between

mental and

other diseases, if a parent puts a nine-year-old child in the
hospital to have his appendix or tonsils taken out, do you
suggest that that child could bs released from the hospital by

II
anyone except the consent of the parents and the hospital?
MR. LACKEY:

No, sir, and I do not think that that

surgery could be authorized by anyone other than the parents.
If

th© Court found that the parents war© acting in bad faith

in denying the child the treatment he needed, of course th©
Court could.
Q

And if the hospital let the child out ©n the

child's request while still under care in the recuperative
stages from the surgery, the hospital would surely be exposed
to a malpractice suit, would they not?
MR. LACKEY:

Yes, sir, and I would expact that they

would lose.
Q

A hospital does not. release any minor without

the signature of th© parents when a child has been in the
hospital for treatment; is that not so?
MR. LACKEY;
Q

I believe so.

Do you know what the law in Georgia is on that?

MR. LACKEY:

The law in Georgia requires—■1 am sorry,

I do not have the specific cits.
Chapter IS’.

1 think it is Title 88,

Has a consent law and requires th© consent of

parents before medical treatment can be rendered to children.
Georgia Cede, section—
Q

And before they can be released from th©

hospital?
MR. LACKEY;

Georgia Cods, Section 74-104 makes

12
parents explicitly responsible for th© welfare and care of
their children.

There is no law that says that before a

hospital can release a patient--! am sorry, I am going around
your question, sir.

I cannot say and I do not believe that

there is a law that says with respect to any facility a
hospital has to have parents’ permission.

There is a law her©

that s&ys that if a child wants to leave, his leaving can be
conditioned upon the consent of his parents.

In this lawsuit

there is that statute.
Q

That is a mental law?

MR. LACKEY:
Q

That is correct, sir.

Which is the on© that is before us.

MR. LACKEYs

That is correct, and I am not familiar

with any similar requirement in the state in th® medical
treatment area.
Let me got back to your question ©r your point,
Mr. Chief Justice.

What our point is is if you say there is

a liberty interest her©, then similarly there is a liberty
interest in that child who is going to have hits tonsils taken
out.

I think we perhaps used a rather gruesome example in our

reply brief, but I think it is appropriate.

And that is the

situation where a parent takes a child to a physician and th©
physician says, "Your child is exhibiting signs of cancer,
tha treatment for which is the removal of his leg.”

Under th®

very liberal definition of liberty that the District Court

13
applied, clearly the consequence

of that parental decision

is going to deprive the child of his liberty, again as the
District Court has defined it.

And as ‘the United States noted

in its amicus brief, it would be unprecedented to argue that
th® child has a liberty right, a right to be processed in that
situation»

And in fact no one argues that.

They are simply

arguing that in this particular case, mental illness, this
child has a right to due process.

No one argues that he would

have that right in any other area.

And we suggest that that

is just simply inconsistent with the way constitutional rights
have been defined.
Q
due process.

To put. it strictly, everybody has the right to
If they are going to be denied a liberty or

property, you never roach a conclusion that the Du© Process
Claus® is not applicable.

You can say that what was don© did

not deprive them of any liberty or property.

MR. LACKEYs

That is correct, sir.

But at th© point

we ar® in the, argument right now, it is our position that th©
child does not have a liberty right at all at this point vis-avis his parents, not vis-a-vis the stats.

Constitutional

rights 1 believe you can say do not: exist in the abstract.
They exist because of relationships.

You might say there is a

constitutional right when you have get the child versus th©
state as ir. th© case of In Re Gault.

But when you are talking

about the parent and ths chile, and the parent making a decision

14
for the chi Id , ws say there is no liberty interest.

And that

is where the Court should hav® focused first and did not,
the District Court.
Q

Why do you not narrow it?

sums liberty rights.

The child still has

You are just talking about the one

liberty that is involved here.
MR. LACKEY;
Q

Yes, sir, that is correct.

Yon keep broadening it.

X would not broaden it

too much.
MR. LACKEY:

X certainly would not intend to say

that the child does not have any liberty interest—only a
liberty interest not to challenge his parents' medically
indicated decisions.

That is how narrowly I want to define it,

and 1 do not mean to broaden it ary more.
However, even if the Court decides that in fact
-there is a liberty interest hers that could be protected, the
second question is the on© that was advanced by the Court
itself and that was whether or not there is stats action
involved in this case.
The best way to address tbs state action question,
from our perspective, is to consider what this Court said in
Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority., and that is that you
have to look at the case and sift the facts and circumstances
to determine whether there is stato action here.
What we can say

is that the challenged statute her®

15

dess not; authorise parents to provide medically indicated
treatment for thair children.

It doss not encourage it»

do not go out and seek the children.

We

The bast characterisation

of what wa do is we provide a resource, and that is it.

We

provide a resource just as any private hospital would be a.
resource.

W© simply are fulfilling a proprietary function in

this case.

And, as 1 said, our position is that it ought t©

b© looked at from a practical standpoint.

It seems imprac­

tical-"
Q

But you do not take the child just on the say-

so of the parant and the parent’s doctor.
MR. LACKEY:
Q

That is correct, sir.

So, you go through still a further procedure.

MR. LACKEY:

The way we have characterised it is that

we do in fact have a gate keeper.
keeper.

We will not.

We do in fact have a gate­

But what we do is we decide—
Q

And you decide that it is medically indicated

or that treatment is indicated.
MR. LACKEY:

That is correct.

We decide that the

child meets the criteria of being mentally ill and suitable
for treatment.

But of course that is the same function that any

doctor provides in any hospital.

And what we are saying is

that it seems illogical to say that if a parent has money, if
he has assets, if he has resources, h© can go to a private
facility? and if th® psychiatrist or the physician or whatever

16
agrees with him, he can put his child in that hospital without
going to a juvenile court proceeding, without going through an ■
adversarial hearing.

But if he does not have the mon®y, if he

does not have the assets, we ar© going to make him go to an
adversarial proceeding.

If he has to go fc© our juvenile court,

get a lawyer, get a lawyer for his child or the court will
appoint one, of course.
Q

As to your gat© keepar, he can say no as to

admission to a state facility where the parents and their
doctor have said yas.

But ha cannot say yes if this parents

and their doctor say no.
MR. LACKEY:

That is correct.

That really follows

from what the Court said in Jackson v, Metropolitan Edison.
What we are doing is we are allowing & choice that, the parent
has to initiate.

The parent has to initiate the action or the

guardian has to initiate the notion that leads the child to the
hospital.
Q

What due process protection does the child have

in your view if the parents ar© affluent and simply take the:
child to their own private psychiatrist or child specialist
and that doctor recommends commitment and the commitment takes
place in a private hospital?
MR. LACKEY:
nothing.

No.

Any hearing'—
That child receives absolutely

Ha does what- his parents tell him, and the parents

of course decide what to do based on 'the doctor' s advice.

I

17
think that is our main point, that in that case that parent
can put that child in that hospital, but here he is going to
have to go through an adversarial process to achieve the same
result, which is simply to get mental health treatment for
his mentally ill child»
Q

A private hospital is also subject to habeas

corpus, is it not?
MR. LACKEY:

Yes, sir.

And X think that the law would

allow you to challenge the place and the reason for your
detention, even in a private facility.
Q

Apart from that, what would you think about the

claim of the child that he was wrongfully committed for
improper reasons in a malpractice suit against the physician?
MR, LACKEY:

He would certainly hav© a false

imprisonment suit against the physician.

He could not su© his

parents in Georgia.
Q

Even if hs did not have one against his parents?

MR. LACKEY:
Q

That is -correct.

That is correct.

Because of the existence of that possible

liability, do not the private institutions follow precisely th«,
same procedure that the state institution does?

Do they not

examine before they admit?
MR. LACKEY:
Q

Y©3, sir.

So, what is the discrimination?

MR. LACKEY:

The discrimination that I was addressing,

18
if it exists at ally is one based on wealth.

And it is simply

that--Q

But idie wealthy parent can commit the child if

the doctor of the committing institution will receive the
child.

That is exactly what happens here.

But you

are

saying that will continue to be the case, whereas the District
s

Court changed the rule.
MR. LACKEYs

If the District Court's order stands

unchanged, that will not be th® instance with respect to the
public hospitals,

It will continue to be so with the privet©
%

hospitals.

There would be no reason for them to change that.

I am aware of.
The second issue with respect to state action of
course is what happens once the child is in.

I just wanted

to briefly touch that and make the point that we made in our
brief, that our position is that once the child is in th®
facility, as long as he continues to meet th© minimum criteria,
w@ simply act as does any custodian of th® child that theparent has entrusted his child to.
the parent, wants the child.

We release the child when

We do not release th® child,

assuming these minimal conditions are mat, if th© parent wants
the child to stay in.
Even if the Court finds there is a liberty interest
in state action here of course, you have still got the, issue
of what process is due.

19
Q
on©

One of these named plaintiffs—and I realise

of them is now deceased--but som© members of this class

were committed at the behest of the state as guardian.
MR. LACKEY;
Q
I suppose.

That is correct.

In that category there clearly is state action,
The state initiates it;.

MR. LACKEY;
Q

You do concede it.

MR. LACKEY:
Q

I concede state action.

Yes, sir.

So, really your argument is kind of moot, is it

not?
MR. LACKEY;

sir, if I lose the argument on the

children who were placed by state agencies and prevail on the
state action on those children that are not, I will have
succeeded since the vast majority are admitted by their parents.;
Q

Even when the parents bring the child to the

hospital, as soon as the state-employed physician, psychiatrist,
enters

and participates in the commitment, would you say that

is or is not state action?
MR. LACKEY;
action.

I would say that that is of course state

I would say that ' it doss not rise to the level

necessary to implicate the Fourteenth Amendment.
Q

But it is state action at that stage.

MR. LACKEY:
Q

I cannot deny that it is state action.

The dam© way that it is state action if the stata

20

was proceeding as a guardian ad latam for the child.
MR. LACKEY:

There is a different level or a

different quantum of state action.

But yes,, sir, state action

in both.
Q

Then it is

part of your position that that

participation by th© shate—namely, the doctor at the
institution takes a look at the child—that is an essential
condition to the

deprivation of liberty, assuming it is .&

liberty„
MR. LACKEY:

Assuming it is a deprivation, it cannot

b© accomplished without the physician's approval or denial.
Q

It is essential because it is part of the

regular procedure.

Are you still arguing that it is not state

action?
MR. LACKEY:
progression.

I am saying that all—it is not a

The parents have already decided that the child

needs to be in the hospital.
Q

But, he cannot got in the hospital unless the

state examines him and says yes, you can com® in.
MR, LACKEY:

That is correct.

But what the state is

doing is that the state is saying—is simply affirming the
parents' deci3ion.
Q

But your argument on the merits is that that is

an essential part ©f the procedure.
MR. LACKEY:

I egroa.

That is correct, sir.

21
Q

And you still say it is not state action?

MR. LACKEY:

It makes the

state action very

difficult.
Q

I would think so.

Q

And they not only do not let them in unless

they agree but they implement the decision.
MR. LACKEY:

That is correct.

They treat them.

They treat them.
Even if you find that there is liberty in state
action, the question is , What processes do?

The parent does not necessarily come to the

Q

No, that is? correct, sir? he does not.

He may coma with the family physician but then

that is subject to screening by the state authority.
MR. LACKEY:
Q

That is correct.

But the state will examine the child and take

the child even though there is no other medical opinion but
the state's?
MR. LACKEY:
Q

That is correct.

That is correct.

Is it not true» that in the average case -'die only

qualified psychiatrist is the state psychiatrist?
MR. LACKEY:
Q

Yes, 1 would agree.

So, I mean, the ultimate decision as to the

mentality of the child is mads by the state doctor.
MR. LACKEY:
Q

That is correct.

I am not going to say that harms your case or not,

but that is true.
MR. LACKEY:

That is correct.

I do not deny that.

The point I was making is that it is a team approach
when they come to the hospital.

You have got, as I said,

The state has no stake in

There is no proof that the child or the

state gets anything if the child is admitted.

The record is

clear that we do not operate at capacity in our hospitals.
The. record is replete with evidence on that basis.
But even the child is mistakenly hospitalised, even
if the chiId3s parents have the wrong motives and bring that
child to the hospitalized, even if the doctors just completely
do the wrong thing and admit the child, the child still has
access to the courts.

And I think that that ought to b©

considered if it has not been considered yet.
Q

By

what processes do you mean, habeas corpus?

MR. LACKEY:

Mo, sir.

Of course they have habeas

corpus, but that is not what they need to rely on.

There is

specific provision in Georgia Cod®, Chapter 88-5, the mental
health cod®, that tb© children or that any patient can go to
the probate court of the county and claim that the chapter is
being abused, the cod® chapter.
Q

How does a seven-year-old child set those

proceedings in motion?

24

MR. LACKEY:

Your Honor,. 1 do not want to appear

flip with xny answer, but I would refer the Court to its
decision in Bellotti v. Baird where the Court of course had
an abortion decision where the Massachusetts statute said that
parents could be required to consent to the abortion or the
child could be required to get hie parents’ consent.

But if

the child could not get his parents' consent, he could then go
to the courts and get an order,

She could then go to the courts

and get an order authorising the abortion, and it would be
appear that the ten or eleven

or twelve year old child who

is in this case would get to court, the same way the ten, eleven
or twelve,

thirteen year.old girl would get to court in

Bellotti.

The child neod not rely expressly on that.

There is

also the provision in the Code that requires DHR to provide
access to counsel if the patients need it.

The record will

disclose-—and I do not think the appellees dispute—that w©
provided office space for these attorneys in our mental health
facility and that it was our staff that referred these children
to these lawyers.

I think that the system in its totality

demonstrates that children can get into court..

i:
Q

Let me take the reverse of Mr. Justice

Marshall's hypothetical statement.

Suppose the family physician

and two private practitioners ©f psychiatry bring the child to
the state and say,

"W@

think the child should be committed,"

and the state psychiatrist makes the usual examination and says,

25
"No# I 'think this child just needs outpatient treatment, and
I will not commit."

That would be the end of the matter#

would it not?
MR. LACKEY:
Q

No one could force the state to take the child?

MR. LACKEY:
Q

That is correct# sir.

That is correct# sir,

You do not have mandamus down there?

MR. LACKEY:

Yes# but you cannot mandamus someone

to perform a discretionary function# and that is what this
would be.

They could mandamus hixr to perhaps examine the

child# but they could not mandamus to be admitted.
There is one issue that I do not want to get away
from.

I do not want to sit down without addressing it# and

that is the substantive due process issue because that--1 know
I have spent a lot of time on the procedure question, but that
is the nut of this case.
the first instance.

That is why this case was brought in

And we think that the District Court’s

decision there was incorrect and has to be reversed.
What the District Court has

said to us in this

substantive due process question is that if a parent brings a
child to a state mental hospital and our physician examines
that child and he says, "This child is mentally ill.
treat him in my hospital.

I can

1 can give him some benefit.

But

if I had my choice, I would send him to a group home or a
specialized foster home#” then we cannot provide treatment for

26

that child if we do not have that specialized foster horns or
that group horns.

What the District Court has said is that if

wa are going to provide treatment for these children, we have
to provide the treatment in the most appropriate treatment
setting.

And if we do not have it,

we cannot provide the

treatment.
The absurdity of this is that if an adult comes to
our hospital, he has got schizophrenia, paranoiac type, even
if h© is not appropriate for hospitalization in this case—
they have adult foster homes “’“ever if he is not appropriate
for hospitalization, he can go into that hospital because he
is presumed to bs able to assume the risk of going into the
hospital.

But under the District Court’s decision, if a child

comes to that hospital with that exact same condition, we
•cannot put that child in the hospital.

His parents cannot

waive his constitutional rights under the District Court’s
opinion.

And that child will go without treatment until that

child either degenerates to the point where hospitalization is
appropriate or until the parent is able to find some private,
care for him.
to us.

And it just does not seem to be a logical result

And it, is certainly on© that should not be allowed in

this case.

It is a result that should be avoided.
I know in our reply brief I accused the—I think that

is perhaps the wrong word—but I mentioned a parade of horribles,
and I do not want the Court to

27
doing her®.

Any fair reading of that District Court's

decision, particularly when coupled with the order denying the
stay, makes it absolutely clear that the District Court said,
"I find that every moment of inappropriate hospitalization of
a child denies that child a substantive due process interest.
Every moment of inappropriate hospitalisation."

And he found

that it was inappropriate when we could think of some other
treatment setting that was more appropriate.
Q

Do you think under the under--I think you were

asked this earlier—the stats may completely release the 46
children?
MR. LACKEYs

Yes, sir, there is no question in my

mind that we can do that.
Q

The state has not boon ordered to provide them

with the more appropriate setting?
MR. LACKEY:

No, sir, but we do have a slight prob­

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Cromartie.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN L. CROMARTIE, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. CROMARTIE:

Mr. Chief Justice,, may it please

the Court:
The issues in this case are very narrow although
difficult.

I would like in my argument to deal first with the

procedural-due process issue and then deal with the substan­
tive process issue, if the Court will permit.
Q

Very specifically would you explain, at least

to my benefit, why the presentation of the child by the parents
to the state psychiatrist and the processes that then occur is■
not sufficient due process.
MR. CROMARTIE:

Your Honor, we feel that the process

of examination by the superintendent is inadequate as a due
process substitute, for several reasons.
Q

The claim is not that it is a due process

substitute but that it is adequate under what is required by
the Constitution, that it is due process.
MR. CROMARTIE:
Q

That it is all the process which is due.

MR. CROMARTIE:
on that.

Yes, You:r Honor.

Yes, Your Honor, I stand corrected

We feel that for several reasons though it is

inadequate.
First of all, it is not really a hearing at all.

It

29
is not processed.

There is no notice to the child of what will

happen during this interview.

There is no requirement of look­

ing at other resources in the test under the Georgia law.
Virtually all of the information comes from the parents.

And

later in my argument I will develop the conflicts of interest
inherent between the parent and the child.

That information

is unverified and frequently inadequate that comes through that
process.

In essence, there is no structure whatsoever.
Secondly-—
Q

Ara you suggesting that there is inherently

and universally a conflict of interest between parent and child
in this setting?
MR. CROMARTIE:

We feel that tiiere is a substantial

chance; of conflicts of interest between parent and child
inherently, yes, Your Honor.

And I can get into that argument

now and jump from the superintendent's argument.
Q

Do it in your own order.

MR. CROMARTIEs

The superintendent's decision though

I
is inadequate for a number of other reasons.

The state has

contended that the informality is adequate because of a
comprehensive screening process that happens prior to coming to
the hospital.

The state's own witnesses establish that that

screening process is inadequate.

Dr. Filley testified that it

is not mandatory, that, that screening process can be and is
sometimes ignored.

Dr. Filley testified that the development

30
of community screening resources are lagging far behind those
of adults.
J. R.

And finally you have the facts involving J. L. and

Both of them were screened by a community screening

process.

And yet--and the recommendations of their therapist

was that they should not be hospitalised—and yet that
recommendation was not even considered by the admitting
physician.

I think that those facts go to show how inadequate

that community screening process is.
Next, we are relying on the fact of the uncertainty
of diagnosis that this Court has noted before in terms of
psychiatrists, the tentativeness of professional judgment.

We

had expert witnesses who testified to the institutional biases
that are reflected through the decision of institutional
psychiatrists.

And finally the District Court went to these

facilities, looked at the admissions process, and they found
thv.t the admission process as set up does not provide due
process protection.

So, for all of those reasons wa do not

seal the superintendent’s decision is sufficient.
Q

When you say the District Court wont to the

hospital and looked at the procedures, did one or more of the
judges sit in on, say, an interview between a psychiatrist and
the family?
MR. CROMARTXE;
they sat in on.

I do not know of any interviews that

All three judges—-Judge Bell and Judge Bootle

and Judge Owens—visited two of the facilities, one at the

31
choica of the defendant and one at the choice of the plaintiff.
And they state in their decision that during those days that
they were visiting the facilities that they talked with state
employees and talked with patients

and, during that process,

talked about the admissions procedures, about the treatment
in there, all ©f these issues.

But 1 do not think there is

anything in the record to indicate that they actually set in
on the interviews tharaselves.
Q

Did either of the parties have an opportunity to

cross-examine the judges about their observations?

Was 'there

any adversary process attending the judges’ view?
MR. CROMARTIEs

No, Your Honor, other than the

exchanges that occurred during the hearings—there were several
hearings that took place, but there was no right to crossexamine the judge, and 1 know of no such right.
Q

What would your idea be of an adequate hearing?

Starting off, do you need a judge?
MR. CROMARTIE:

Your Honor, we do not feel that, the

Court needs to roach that issue.

But if the Court decides to

reach 'the issue we think that at least some sort of deliberation,
some impartial hearing examiner, whether they be a judge or
whether they bo other professional, might well suffice.

We

focus in on— .
Q

The stats psychiatrist?

:4R. CROMARTIE;

It perhaps could

even ba a state

32
psychiatrist.
Q

Do you not have that

MR. CROMARTIE;

at times?

Your Honor, you have a state

psychiatrist in the same'institution.

And Dr. Messinger

testified very clearly that there are institutional biases at
work there.
Q

What is the bias, that they want more people?

MR. CROMARTIE:

Your Honor, the testimony from

Dr. Messinger was that, frequently psychiatrists in an
institution tend to overinstitutionalise.
Q

They tend to—

Did he also testify that it is hardly possible

to get two psychiatrists to agree on anything?
MR. CROMARTIE:

That is a part of the liability of

the whole process, the danger--! would much prefer that the
hearing be held in front of a judge or at least some other
substitute such as that.
Q

All of these defects and doubts that you are

now talking about are squally applicable, I suppose, when the
question is whether an adult shall, be received into one of
these hospitals, is it not?
MR. CROMARTIE;
Q

Yes?, Your Honor.

1 mean, the same uncertainty about the science

of psychiatry and the same biases—
MR. CROMARTIE;
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

--institutional biases on the part of

33

psychiatrists and so on.

And there is no claim whan an adult,

presents himself, after having consulted with a doctor, that
anything is required beyond what is presently accorded, is
there?
MR. CROMARTIE

%

You are speaking of a voluntary

admission?
Q

Yes, I am speaking of a voluntary admission.

So, this case really boils down, parses down, does it not, to
the claim that the understanding of th© law that has existed
for centuries that a parent makes decisions for his minor
child is invalid?
MR. CROMARTIE:

Your Honor, we do not feel that

parents have been able to institutionalise their children in
state mental institutions for canturies.
Q

Has that not been the presumption of th© law

forever, the Anglo-Saxon law, that—now, there are matters of
definition.

What is a child?

I suppose th® law has never

8aid that a parson 35 years old is still a child.

But setting

aside those problems of definition, has not the law always been
that a parent makes decisions for his or her minor child, where
that child is going to be educated, how that child is going to
be punished, when .and if th© child is going to g© to the
hospital, what time the child is going to go to bed, wh&t time
he is going to get up, what time he is going to have breakfast,

u ch j r no

.: irrsr ?

34

MR. CROMARTIE:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Has that not always been the implicit recogni­

tion ©f the law in cur society?
MR. CROMARTIEs

The explicit recognition, I would

Q

Both.

MR. CROMARTIE:

The traditional way that w© protect

children is through the parent,

And we are asking the Court

her© under these vary narrow circumstances—that is, institu­
tion all said on in a mental hospital—that the traditional way
we protect children is not valid her©*

And wa think that ths

evidence in this case clearly leads to that sort of conclusion.
If I may review—
Q

So, the gist her© is that your attack is on that

basic presumption in this context, is it not?
MR. CROMARTIE;
Q

I think it has feo be.

Because it is no attack at all on the procedures

In so far as they are applicable to adults.
MR, CROMARTIE;

No, Your Honor, it is not.

of court®

the difference between those two I think is in the case of an
adult of course it is truly voluntary.
Q

This is voluntary if you presume that a parent

can speak for his child.
MR. CROMARTIE:
a

Yes, Your Honor. ■

This is purely voluntary

.also.

35

MR. CROMARTIE:

Part of car argument is that the

traditional protections though for the child are not here
under these instances.
Q

And let me review for you—-

Before you get to that review, tell me, if you

would™or if you prefer to do it after the review-- how you
distinguish the hospitalization at a mental facility from
hospitalisation for feh© tonsillectomy or for appendectomy and
that sort ©f thing.
MR. CROMARTIE;
it is different.

Thar© are a number of reasons that,

One, the stigma of institutionalization in'

a mental institution far transcends any stigma that might b©
attached to the regular hospital.

Arid, secondly, the very

essence of treatment in a mental institution is confinement.
That is the purpose of putting somebody in a maximum security
mental hospital, is to confine them, to deprive their liberty.
Q

Certainly while you are recovering from a

serious operation you are confined in a hospital in the gam©
way you are confined in a mental institution.
MR. CROMARTIE;

That is incidental to the treatment.

And historically we have treated the two very differently.
Q

Is not confinement in a mental hospital incidental

too in the vary function of the treatment?
MR. CROMARTIE:

I think not.

I think that the reason

you would b© in a states mental institution rather than soma
alternative facility, less restrictive facility, would be for

36
the confinement: itself, and there is testimony from Dr» Hodges
and others that that is what you tire talking about in the
mental facility itself»

I am not talking about the community

facilities or that sort of thing»

But historically the law

has treated the two differently.
Sam Brakel in his book for the American Bar Associa­
tion has pointed that historically our law has required

very

strict requirements in terras of placing people in stats mental
institutions.
Q

Is this true for so-called voluntary commitment

because that is what we are dealing with her©?
MR. CROMARTIE:
new

Voluntary commitment is a relatively

phenomenon.
Q

Has the law set up all sorts of processes in

connection with voluntary commitment?
MR. CROMARTIB:
Q

Wo.

Not for adults.

So, your attack is on the basic proposi­

tion that has been accepted that a parent makes decisions for
his child?
MR. CROMARTIB:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Do you say that the parent cannot make the

decision hare?
MR. CROMARTIB:

3

Yes, Your Honor.

Who can?

MR. CROMARTIB:

We think that a hearing examiner or

37
v/hoevar the state decides should make the decision right now
under the—

Fundamentally we do not think that a

Yes, Your Honor.

Now you tell me that that is wrong.

I want to

Why is not that group as expert as the parent on the

question of insanity and mental illness.
MR. CROMARTIE:

The Court found that the process in

biases, because of the tentativeness of judgment, those reasons
the Court found that it was inadequate.

That is not the only alternative

There are other alternatives.

The question is whether

hospital.

No question there are other places that the

children could ba placed.
Q

There fur© other alternatives.

But your whole argument from the outset makes

parents as such a suspect class by saying—your statement that
tr-ors is an inherent conflict between the interests of the

33

child and the interests of the parent and that that must be
flushed out in some proceeding.
MR. CROMARTIE:

Yes, Your Honor.

these situations involve stressful home situations, emotionally
charged home situations.
experts.

That was the testimony of all of the

Parents cannot under those circumstances be expected

to be totally objective about the process.
Secondly, ©very expert in this.case, including all
of the

superintendents of the hospitals, testified that the

pathology of a child is inextricably related to the pathology
of the; par-rents?

That .is, the parents themselves .nr© a part

of the problem that is going on here in the vast majority of
cases.
Q

The state, your colleague, your friend on the

other side dees not contend that 1he state can just take the
parents9 word and put the child in the hospital.
MR. CROMARTIE:

There lc that further step, Your

Honor.
Q

There is always going to be medical advice.

I

think your problem is to convince us that the medical advice,
or the procedures at the hospital are not adequate because non©
of those people take the word of the parent and just say,
"Do you want your child treated?
MR. CROMARTIE:

we will treat him."

Your Honor, we feel that the record

40
is replete with instances of where; that stags is inadequate.
For instance, a psychiatrist doss not necessarily even see the
child before the child is placed in the institution.

Dr. Gates

testified that sometimes no psychiatrist even sees the child
until later, until the decision is already made to commit the
child.

They rely so heavily on this elaborate community

screening t© provide them with adequate information.

They

themselves admit that the procedure at the hospital itself is
very, very informal ^nd I think subject to error.

What they

claim though to substitute for that is this elaborate
community screening process outside the hospital.

And yet

Dr. Filley, who is head of the thing, testified that that
component is lagging way, way behind.

What you have really said here is that the

trists or as many as were available and that the institutional

Mr. Cromarti©, you may

I think we have a question pending.
MR. CROMARTIE:

Yes, Your Honor.

May it. please the

Court:
Prior to the break, the Chief Justice had asked me
the question as to whether it would be different if there were
a panel of 12 psychiatrists and one of those 12 participated
in the decision-making process? would that satisfy our need
for a hearing?—if I understood the question correctly.
Q

It was only ten.

MR. CROMARTIE:

Only ter., all right.

I do not think

that the two would be material anyway.
My response to that would be no, not as long as the
process were set up the same as it is right now.

Our basic

position is that the process right now does not protect the
child's interests in terms of sifting the facts, sifting through
the facts? there is no opportunity for the child to crossexamine what has allegedly been his conduct.

There are no

statewide standards of procedure where the child knows what the
rules of the game are.
Q

You are assuming of course two things there.

The child is concerned with what you call the rules of the gam®
and, second, that rules in the sens© that implies an adversary
type proceeding may be the worst thing in the world for a child

42
in these circumstances.
MR. CROMARTIE:

Yes, Your Honor, because we do not

feel that the Court has to reach the issue of the rules because
all the Court said was, "Your procedure has no protections in
it whatsoever, and look to other state laws that do provide
some protection for children and clo involve commitment of
children to mental institutions/' and said use those in the
interim.

If the legislature wants to come in and set up'other

provisions, then they are free to do that under the Court's
decision.

But the Court pointed to the Juvenile Court Code,

which does allow the child to have a hearing and yet takes care
of the vex*y trauma issues that you: raise—that is, it has
provisions in there to help deal with any alleged trauma that
might take place.
There is a provision there for excusing the child
from the hearing at certain times.

There is a provision for

appointment of a guardian ad litem to make sure that the3,
child's interests are adequately protected.
The Court did not specify what additional protections
would be needed.

It simply said the Ceox-gia procedure, as it

presently exists, is not enough.
Q

There needs to be more.

It certainly implied that the Juvenile Court

procedures ware adequate, did it not?
MR. CROMARTIE:

That they were available and that

they did provide some type of hearing, yes.

43

in fact, one-third of the children in Georgia—
Q

Are committed through those procedures.

MR. CROMARTIE:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Then there is another procedure, the Ordinary

Court?
MR. CROMARTIE:

Yes, Your Honor.

That is how adults

ara normally institutionalized.
Q

What is that called, the Ordinary Court?

MR. CROMARTIE:
Q

Court of Ordinary.

Court of Ordinary?

MR. CROMARTIE:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

What is; that, like a probate court?

MR. CROMARTIE:

It is a probate court, yes, sir.

And children could ba committed through that.

In

fact, they are frequently.
Q

Your objection to a panel of psychiatrists,

10 or 12, I suppose would be that they had this pro-institutional
bias and that they would not b© neutral hearing officers; is
that it?

His demeanor has

And there is no chance for the

child to confront that and fe© say, "No? that is not the way it
was. ”
Q

You mean a four-year-old child?

MR. CROMARTIE:
Q

Or a representative for that child.

How can a representative say what th© child

did or did not do?
MR. CROMARTIE:

Th© representative can investigate

and cross-examine the people and see whether that is—it is
done every day.

And \m feel strongly that in terms of th© age

of the children, that a four or a five or a six year eld,
that there has to be protection there too.

It is dramatically

illustrated by th® two children that are named plaintiffs.

The children

They are not going

A lot of the

balancing that I am. talking about right here under the
Mathews-EIdridge tost requires that you look at all elements ,
and I really have not talked about the magnitude of the child's
interests.

What we are talking about here ara two children

that were hospitalized for five arid a half years in an
institution, and now thsir own psychiatrists are saying they
do not even need to be there.

Their outpatient therapist said

they did not nasd to bo .there in the first place.

That is a

r:ther enormous interest that wa ar® talking about right her©.
Q

Maybe—-1 say maybe—while they do not need to

be. there, concaiveably that might b@ the best place for them
among the various options now available in Georgia, including
their own family or some other hospital or some other
institution or possibly a foster family, but maybe it would
b© impossible to find a foster family.
MR. CROMARTIE;

It. is ironic to me-

that I was

furnished a list this morning—there were 46 kids that the
state has consistently said, "There is nothing we can do with

46
those children.

There is no alternative for thorn."

And yet

all but two of them are out of the institution now, and they
have not built any new facilities.

There are other alternatives

available, and I think that this due process hearing 'that we
are talking about—whatever the particular form might be—would
center in on that one thing, it would be well worth the effort.
That is, in the community to look at what other alternatives
are available and to look at that in the community and to see
if there are other alternatives available.
Q

How does Georgia define a child, what age?

what age are we talding about, up to what age?
MR. CROMARTIE:
Q

We are talking about through age 17.

Through age 17.

Is that th© statutory

definition?
MR. CROMARTIE:
Q

In Georgia, up to the 18th birthday?

MR. CROMARTIE %
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes, Your Honor.

And from then on, over 18 it is an adult for

this purpose under Georgia law?
MR. CROMARTIEs
3

Yes, Your Honor.

What you are postulating hare is some sort of

at least quasi-adversary proceeding which, as I hear your
argument, would bo a four-sided sort of procedure—the parents,
the child, the experts, the doctors, the medical experts» the
clinical psychologists, and the guardian ad litem.

And you

47
suggest, that putting a child through 'that four-sided kind of
adversary procedure is not going to have an irreversible
traumatic effect on the child?
MR. CROMARTIE:

Your Honor, I cannot imagine any

more trauma on a child than what J. L. and J. R. have gone
through for th© past five years, to be dumped--end literally
dumped—
Q

That is an overstatement, is it not?

MR. CROMARTIE:

Your Honor, the testimony of

Dr. Messinger is that he had never seen a more classic, more
clearcut example of parents dumping a child than th© case of
J. L.

But getting to your question, there is an amicus curies

brief before the Court: right now.

The New Jersey Supreme

Court has mandated just such a procedure there, and their
experience has been that in fact these hearings have been
therapeutic in terms of the parent-child relationship.

It is

no mystery to children that there are conflicts within th©
family.

I mean, children's judgment may not b® totally intact,

but children’s—and I know from asking several of them—-that
children’s perceptions are very good.
year ©Id has vary good perception.

I mean, even a five

They can pick up conflict.

They knew there is conflict with their parents.
ther& is conflict there.

Thay know

Th® hearing can actually be

therapeutic if done say the way w© do it. in our juvenile court
right now.

New, I cannot say how juvenile courts work around

48
the country, but. I know in Georgia our juvenile court works and
it works well.

I mean, I think we have kept th© best of

both, and I have had a lot of practice in juvenile courts.
Wa have managed to keep it informal enough to where nobody is
traumatized by the process.

And yet it is formal enough to

adequately protect the rights of th® people.

Your Honor, I

think it can b© done.
Q

Mr. Cromarfcie, may I ask you whether you expect

to reach what has been called th® substantive due process
issue?
MR. CR0MART1E;
Q

I will now, Your Honor.

You do not have very much time left.

MR. CROMARTXEs

I will new.

We do not feel that the

state has categorized th® issue correctly.

At page 135 of the

Court’s opinion, it made very clear that what it was finding
here was that by th© state * s own admission that there ware 46
children who did not road to be in hospital? and, secondly,
that, they ware being harmed by a continued stay in that
hospital.

And what the Court did, it took the Jackson v.

Indiana test and said that if you are going to hold children,
there has got to be some relationship between the holding and
what you are trying to do for them..
I think -that the Court's holding is very, very
limited, much more limited then what the state would categorize
it as.

It is a very limited holding.

49
Q

You. do uot road the docrso then--particularly

th® italicized portion on page 54A—as requiring the state to
spend money, if necessary, to build these, facilities as
something that, must be complied with even though the stata
would prefer to simply turn the children loose: from any
confinement?
MR. CROMARTIE:

It was a ruling that applied to 46

named specific children.
Q

With respect to them, how do you construe the

ruling?
MR. CROMARTIE-:

That they were to do what was

necessary to relieve the unconstitutional condition that
existed.
Q

Could they relieve it by simply releasing them

from custody?
MR. cromartif.:
Q

I think they probably could,

is that the way you read th© decree?

MR, CRCMAliTIE:
Q

That is the way the stats has.

Is that the way you read • it?

MR. CROMARTIES
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Mr. Croraartie, what is the source of the

Court6s purer•to order th© State of Georgia to spend money for
this project?
.

CROMARTIEi

I think th© Court was convinced in

if a rue mind that the Stats of Georgia did not have to spend

50
anything, that it would actually be cheaper to have these
children in less expensive resources.
Q

But they did command them to spend money, did

they not?
MR. CROMARTIK:

No, Your Honor, they said if that

was what was necessary, spend money.

The Court had told them

several times, "W© do not think that you have to spend any
money.

W© think it is cheaper to have these children in lens

restrictive, less confining environments.
Q

Mr. Cromartie, I might just ask one question

about what is going to happen next after this cases leaves
this Court.

One of the briefs filed by one of the associa­

ti, ons suggests that there should be an exemption for intact
families, pre-adolescent children and for commitments for short
periods of time, at least when all those conditions are mat.
Could that be done consistently with the manner in which the
case was disposed of below, or does that require—how much
flexibility is there in what goes on next?

I guess that is

what I am really asking,
MR. CROMARTIE:

There is a good bit of flexibility

in whet the Court did because it really did not say, "This is
what is required, X, Y, and z," because the APA brief agreed
that the Georgia procedures ware invalid.

What they said was

with an intact family, for a short, period of time, for an
accredited institution, for a,pro-adolescent child, the balancing

51
may b© different there.
Q

Included the District Court—

But under the holding of the District Court,

is the procedure invalid even as applied to that narrow
category?

„

I suppose it is
MR. CROMARTIE:

is it not?

Yes, Your Honor, it is.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.
