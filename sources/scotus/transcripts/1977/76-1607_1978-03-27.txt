MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

Mr, Pitt, you may proceed whenever you are ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARVEY

L. PITT ON

BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR, PITT:
Court:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the

For 33 years the Securities and Exchange Commission

has followed the practice of issuing consecutive but separate
orders of 10 days duration suspending trading in a security
when necessary to provide immediate protection for the investing
public against fraud, manipulation, and inadequate corporate
disclosures.

And the Commission has done so only after making

a separate and fresh review of the then current facts in each
situation,

'**•
The Court of Appeals, however, in this case, has

enjoined the Commission from over again suspending trading in
a security for more than 10 consecutive days, despite the
Commission’s longstanding and consistent administrative
practice, express congressional approval cf that practice,
and reenactment and expansion of the Commission's authority in
that regard.
Although the Commission recognises that it may not
exercise, its summary suspension power for an indefinite
period of time, what we respectfully seek from this Court is

4

*

the restoration of the full measure of .statutory authority
we believe the Congress intended to confer.
QUESTION:

Do you think there is any limit at all

to the number of times the Commission can consecutively
exercise its 10-day suspension authority?
MR, PITT%

Yes, I do.

I think that that would be

■tested by whether the Commission has abused its discretion,
and it would depend on the circumstances.

But surely where

the Commission has adequate basic for permitting

to

resume, it would be an abuse of its discretion, and I think
that courts can review that issue and direct the Commission to
terminate its trading suspension.
QUESTION:

What would you think about 36 consecutive

suspensions of 10 days each?
MR. PITT:

Of course, the Court of Appeals in this

case never reached the question of an abuse of discretion,
and the facts in the context of this case 'do not suggest*that
there was necessarily an abuso of discretion with respect to
that matter.

That is an issue: that could be tested had this

case been heard timely, which is one of the issues this Court
heis asked, me to address.
I do think that at some point a trading suspension
can constitute an abuse of discretion, and certainly in a case
36 consecutive suspensions might constitute an abuse of
discretion.

5
QUESTION:

If the Court had decided it on that

basis, would you be here?
MR. PITT:
abuse of discretion?
QUESTION:

If the Court had held that it. was an
No, your Honor, we would not.
Do you think on the same set of facts;

a court would be justified in setting aside the 20th consecutive
suspension, whereas it wouldn’t be as of the second suspension?
MR. PITT;

I think that there are degrees of

concern that the Commission would have had with respect to
suspensions at varying points in time and that a court, if the
matter were properly presented to it, could differentiate
between the factual circumstances that exist at any time.
Bear in mind I think that the Commission does have
a large measure of discretion in this area.

Its focus is to

protect trading and the public investors who trade in these
securities.

And in this particular case there was an alleged

market manipulation which in fact the Commission ultimately
concluded bad existed.
QUESTION:

But supposing review' is sought after the

second consecutive 10-day suspension and the Court concludes
no abuse of discretion.

There are then 18 more successive

10-day suspensions and review is again sought in the court.
Would the same court be justified in concluding that there was
an abuse of discretion simply by the number of successive
suspensions?

6
MR. PITT:

I do not believe that the mere number of

suspensions per se would give rise to an abuse of discretion.
I think it is hard to fashion that kind of a rule.

X think in

any given factual context, the continued duration of these
suspensions may constitute an abuse of discretion, but X do
not think a court could simply say because it consisted o£
18 consecutive periods that that was an abuse of discretion.
Take, for example, the sifeuatic?n where there is
rampant manipulation ongoing

and the Commission is trying to

get to the bottom of that manipulation.

It is having

difficulty nailing down the evidence, finding out whether the
manipulation existed.

It might take 180 days to put that case

together, go into court, obtain an injunction, and prevent the
manipulators from wreaking the havoc that they might be
perpetrating in the markets,
QUESTION:

You can go in and get a preliminary

injunction, can't you?
MR. PXTTs

We can if we have' put together a prima

facie case indicating the probable likelihood of success on the
merits»
QUESTION:

But your hypothesis is having failed •

do that, you can summarily suspend for 180 days.
MR. PITT?

Ho, my hypothesis —

QUESTION:

Without any evidence.

MR. PXTTs

No.

My hypothesis is that the Commission

7
having sufficient cause to believe that there is a
possibility of manipulation and not having enough evidence yet
to go into court can suspend trading»
QUESTION:

For how long?

How long is it required

to get enough evidence to make up a prima facie case?
MR« PITT:

I think it would be difficult to say

that is susceptible of a hard and fast objective standard»
1 could not say to -the Court that it should taka the Commission
30 days or 40 days or 50 days»

I can say that a court can

look at the type of ease and determine whether an investigation
has bogged down, is not being pursued diligently, or -there are
explanations as to why a matter is taking as long as it is,
And I think that the Commission has an obligation to be
sensitive to the fact that a suspension of trading can cause
some-problems for investors and should be terminated as
promptly as possible»
QUESTION:

In this case it was well over a year,

MR, PITT:

In this case it was 370 days, on® year

wasn5t it?

and 10 days,
QUESTION;

That had been preceded by another series

of suspensions based on different grounds for an even longer
period, right?
MR, PITT:

Yes, but the one-year suspension involved

three separata grounds as it turned out, and the Commission

8
did review the circumstances each 10 days.

We were dealing

with people who were fugitives from justice»

We were dealing

with both foreign and domestic market places

and the effects

of manipulations in both market places»

This was a complicated

case which the Commission had to put together»
QUESTION:

I take it that your argument includes

the argument that

whatever might have been true whan the

statute was first

passed, at least now it should be construed

tiie way you suggest it should be, that Congress has actually
approved this interpretation by the Commission.

It's as

though it w ra now written that the Commission may enter
successive suspensions for 10-day periods if it makes the
appropriate determination.
ME.» PITT:

I would say that as well as the race

that I think the original enactment contemplated the -construction
that we have placed on it for 33 years.

And that, I think,

can be gleaned from a precise reading of the statute.

The

•
QUESTION:

You don't need to make that argument

if your first one is -»
MR. PITT:

Mo, I do not.

‘But we think both

arguments succeed, or should succeed.
QUESTION:

I take it both these observations are

subject to what you seemed to say before, that it may well be
an abuse of discretion to have 36 suspensions of 10 days each.

9
MR. PITT:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

That von would not be here if the court

had based it on an abuse of discretion.
MR. PITT:

That is correct.

We would not be here.

QUESTION:

Didn’t you also say not only had

Congress approved your construction, but indeed had expanded —
MR. PITT:

Yes, your Honor.

In the initial ’34

Act, the authority to suspend tracing was limited to
securities that were listed on an exchange.

In 1964 at the

specific request of the Commission, the Congress expanded that
authority to all securities traded in the over-the-counter
markets as well as in listed securities.

It was at that time

that the Commission presented to the Congress, as it. had
previously each year in its annual report, its consistent
practice of successive but separate suspension orders.

And

the Senate report expressly approved and accepted the inter­
pretation of the Commission, and the House with the Commission’s
assistance in drafting the bill expanded our authority to
encompass over-the-counter markets.
QUESTIONs

Do you think the Commission unambiguously

and clearly explained to Congress the present policy in 1964?
MR. PITTs

Yea, your Honor, I do.

1 think it stems

back not just from the legislative development but from our
annual reports as well.

Starting in 1946 and each year

thereafter we provided and furnished information to the Congress

10

with respect to our practices with regard to trading
suspensions.

I think the Congress was aware of this.

Indeed

in 19 —
QUESTION :

Are you suggesting every Congressman

reads your annual report?
MR. PITT:

I am suggesting that there may be

Congressmen who do read it and do not read it.

I think for

purposes of construing what the congressional intent was when
Congress acted upon our legislation, that our express
explanation of our policies, which took several forms ~ the
annual report may be one lesser form of that.

We also want

to Congress, our oversight committees were apprised of this,
and in 1959 and in 1960 we indicated that the policy of
successive rollovers where a separate determination was made
was one that we had been employing consistently.
express committee approval of that by one
committees.

Wa got

of our oversight

In 1964, we —
QUESTION:

That doesn't constitute a congressional

approval, does it?
MR. PITT:

Well, I think that congressional

expansion of our authority, coupled with acceptance of that
interpretation in the committee reports accompanying the
bill is about as good an indication as we can have in the
circumstances without -QUESTION:

But an approval by oversight committee

11
in 1959 certainly doesn't represent an act of Congress,
MR. PITT:

No.

And that was supplied in 1964.

QUESTION:

So you say that an adequate presentation

of this policy was made to the 1964 Congress that did —
Ml:. PITT:

I do, but I would not minimize the

1959 approval by the oversight committees because Congress, as
this Court is well aware, monitors; the activities of the
independent regulatory agencies through its oversight
committees.

They are the ones responsible for monitoring o r

activities and determining whether our acts are in the first
instance appear to be in accordance with congressional intent.
It is true that the words of a congressional oversight
committee cannot bind -the whole Congress.
QUESTION:

That came in 1964.

Mr. Pitt, are these rollover orders,

s

you describe them, customarily issued ex parte?
MR. PITT:

I thin!;, your Honor, the term "ex parte"

would presume: a proceeding.

And the answer to that is twofold.

The Commission staff usually supplies information to the
Commission.

That is not an adversary context.

It is rimply

the Commission and its staff reviewing information.
We do, however, receive: requests from corporate
issuers, trustees in bankruptcy, and in fact the courts on
occasion, and those are transmitted from the staff to the
Commission.
We have adopted —

12
QUESTIONs

Does the: issuer have any notice and

opportunity to ba heard?
MR. PITTs

An issuer has notice of the fact in most

cases that a suspension is about to be issued unless circum­
stances are of such an emergency nature that we are required
to announce it before notifying the issuer.
We do have a specific procedure that permits an
issuer or emy person who believes that they have information
bearing on the wisdom or lack of wisdom of our trading suspension
power to furnish the Commission with information as to whether
or not a particular trading suspension should be lifted.
QUESTIONS

Could the issuer virtually on demand have

a hearing as to whether or not the continuation of the
rollovers is justified?
MR. PITTs

I am not certain.

If we posit the

situation where it is duo to the issuer's misconduct that i!:
trading suspension has issued, then section 12(j) of the
Securities

Exchange Act contemplates that the Commission

should at some point commence a proceeding.

It is conceivable,

although I must confess I have not given thought to this, that
an issuer ml* it seek under the Administrative Procedures Act
to claim that he can compel agency action

unlawfully withhold,

which is a .12Cj) proceeding to have an adjudication on the
merits„
In the absence of an issuer's violation of the Act,

13
12(j)

Is inapplicable,,

Indeed, that is the problem with the

reasoning of the Court of Appeals that has led us to this
Court.

And in that circumstance it seems to me that an issuer

might have a causa of action for review of an abuse of
discretion.

But I do not know that the issuer could compel

us to hold an administrative proceeding»

But I think in either

event the issuer would get the question before a court and
have a timely resolution of the suspension of its stock.
QUESTIONi

I have two questions, Mr. Pitt.

I will

put them both at once, if I may.
Are there any regulations or anything in -this
record to tell us what kind of a procedure the Ccrrniepien
follows when it issues a successive order?

Is there any kind

of a question, that this be done by somebody saying, e'QK, let's
esc tend another 10 days o'5
And my second question is, if during the period of
suspension the Commission doss find it has enough evidence to
make out a prima facie case of violation, what is the statutory
procedure available to it to go info court and get some kind
of an injunction?

Is there some other than 12(j)?

MR. PITT:

With respect to your first question,

..there is no written rule that binds the Commission to a process.
There is the same consistent approach that the Commission has
■always .followed.

And the record does evidence that here.

Namely, it is that the staff is required, if it believes that

14
a trading suspension should ba continued, to furnish the
Commission with information suggesting why that suspension should
be considered,
QUESTION:

Could that information be, "What we told

you last week is still true"?

Do they hav© to have anything

new?
MR., PITT:

At some point 'the Commission as a matter

of internal discipline requires something now.
QUESTIOH:

Does it each 10 days require something

MR. PITT:

Not necessarily.

new?
It may be, for example,

in this case the staff may be finding out from the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police, as was the case hare, what the extent
of their information was with the manipulation, and it indicated
to the Commission that it. was going to Newfoundland to take
testimony.

That took several weeks to arrange.

In that context

it was certainly understandable that 10 days later the
memorandum to the Commission from the staff would indicate the
fact that this was still the procedure that was going to
followed and what the developments were in arranging that
testimony.

But the information would have been the same.
QUESTION:

So if. the information in effect said,

"It will take us about six months to get our case together,”
then they just have rubber stamps for six months.
MR. PITT:

No.

I believe — and, of course, that is

not this case — I believe if the staff thought it would teka
them six months to get the information and. so apprised the
Commission,, that that would be the strongest case for arguing
that the Commission would be under a responsibility to publish
whatever facts it was aware of and terminate the suspension
as promptly as possible'»

But that situation would foe the kind

of situation that could be dealt with in a case seeking to
review the Commission's actions for abuse of discretion»

tion.

QUESTION:

I am puzzled.

MR. PITT;

If 1 have not responded, I can elaborate.

QUESTION:

You haven't responded to the second ques­

Maybe yota don't remember it.
I

MR. PITT:

The second question, as I understood it,

wets what statutory remedies are available to the Commission
if there is issue of misconduct?
QUESTION:

No.

If it's a situation not covered by
\

\

12(j) and there is need for a long first suspension of more
than 10 days and there is probable cause to prove all sorts of
violations of the statute, what would you do?

Would you just

use the 10-day power, or would you ever go into court?
MR, PITT:

Again, it would depend on the kind of

information we had available. If 12(j) is inapplicable, we
would use the 10-day power either to assist us in getting into
court, for example, with a temporary restraining order, or
preliminary injunction, because by that time we would have filed

16

our complaint, the facts would be public, and investors would
be alerted to what our allegations were, end that is our policy.
We do not wait for the action to be litigated.
QUESTION:

I am just wondering why, if you have

the 10-day power you claim, why you would ever run into court
for a preliminary injunction.
MR. PITT:

Because the preliminary injunction is

necessary to stop the people who are violating the law.

The

fact that we can suspend trading will not protect those people
who have bean victimized by the violations of law.
The Commission's position —
QUESTION:
the injunction?

What, therefore, would be the prayer of

Would the injunction necessarily stop trading?

MR. PITT;

No.

In that circumstance, the suspension

of trading would be necessary to alert investors to the facts.
Once they are informed of the facts, the Commission does not
j
assume a paterna..istic position. Investors once they know as
much as we know are free to make their own investment decisions
so long as there is not a manipulation in the market place.
That is something that would be of greater concern.
QUESTION:

And therefore the prayer of the injunction

would be designed to terminate- the alleged manipulation i.
market place, wouldn't it?
MR. PITT:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

The injunction wouldn't necessarily include

17

a prayer that all trading ba suspended, would it?
MR- PITT:

The injunction in that circumstance would

not address itself to trading at all»

And once the complaint

was filed, the trading suspension would be lifted,
QUESTION?

The purpose of the suspension, then, is

to give you time to assemble the information to make public
so that thereafter the investing public can make informed
decisions,
MR, PITT:

That is precisely the purpose of the

suspension, although in the case of a market manipulation, it
may be to get us into court and take some preliminary action,
In the market manipulation context, the fact that there is some
information may not prevent investors from being abused.

But

by and large, your. Honor has concisely stated what our need for

the suspension powers are,
QUESTION:

In this case it took, a year to get enough

information to issue the appropriate press release,
MR, PJTTs

“n this case there were +•>

separate

bases in this series of suspensions, consecutive suspensiori
orders.

There was a market manipulation both here and abroad

that had to be tracked down; there was a change in management
of the company; and there were failure to file current reports,
three separate bases that occurred over the course of that
one-year period, which is precisely why we believe that the
limitation that the Court of Appeals below put on our suspension

18

power is inconsistent with the statutory intent# both in 1934,
again in 1964, and finally in 1975 when the Act was amended
again.
Briefly stated, the Court also asked us to address
the question of mootness.

I hope it is plain that the Commission,

or course, prefers a decision on the merits in this case because
our summary suspension authority has been a critical element
of our enforcement and policing of the securities markets»
Nevertheless, because the Court invited us to discuss the
question of mootness, we have given careful consideration to
whether this case was properly before the Court of Appeals»
In terns of the relevant facts on that issue, I think
all that need be stated is that at the time this case was
presented to the court below, the petition was filed, nine clays
later the suspension was terminated.

At the time of oral

argument, at the time of briefing, and at the time of the
Second Circuit's decision, there were no trading suspensions in
effect.
The court held, nevertheless, that the case was not
moot based on this Court's decision in Southern Pacific Terminal
Company v. ICC, suggesting that the matter was capable of
repetition yet evading review.
QUESTIONS
for?

What did the complaint in this case ask

An injunction or declaratory judgment or money damages

or all three, or what?

19

MR. PITT:

Your Honor, it asked precisely the

question that gives rise to our dilemma with respect to moot­

)

ness.

There was no district court complaint in tills

particular action, although one had been tried previously.
This was a petition for review pursuant to section 25(a) of
'the Securities

Exchange Act of 1934 which sought review

of a discreta set of orders, this one-year set of orders.
QUESTION:

Not to the Commissionj to the Court of

MR. PITT:

That’s right, to the Court of Appeals.

Appeals.

And it is set forth on page 122 of the appendix.

It does not

challenge in terms all of the Commission’s orders with respect
to trading suspensions.

It challenges one series that lasted,

as the Court has indicated, for a year with respect to
Canadian Javelin stock.
QUESTION:

Why isn't that moot?

MR. PITT:

Well, your Honor, it is not clear that

it is not moot, and it may wall be moot for the following
reasons;

Insofar —
QUESTION:

There is nothing outstanding now, is

MR. PITT:

Insofar as the petition for review

there?

sought judicial review of that precise question as to whether
Canadian Javelin stock should have been suspended, or could
have been suspended, that order no longer exists and the case

20

ordinarily would ba moot.

The analysis, as I understand, this

Court's decisions, requires us to consider whether it's
capable of re:petition and yet evading review.
In a sense it. is not capable of repetition, at
least to the degree of certitude that this Court has required
in its prior decisions, because the specific review proceeding
was of the suspension of Canadian Javelin stock, and it is by
no means clear that this Commission would again suspend trading
in Canadian Javelin stock, more certainly for the same
reasons.
QUESTION:

In Weinstein v. Bradford we said it had

to be capable; of repetition with respect to the particular
parties involved.
MR. PITT:

That is correct.

And it is our conten­

tion, as we set forth both in our petition and in our brief
on the merits in this Court that Weinstein v. Bradford is
dispositive of this case.
QUESTION:

And that therefore it is or is not moot.

MR. PITT:

Therefore, it is moot if the petitioner

is viewed in his capacity as a shareholder of Canadian Javelin
stock, which is the posture he was in in the Court of Appeals.
If, however, the case is viewed with respect to
the generic question of the appropriateness of trading
suspensions, it is certainly clear that this is an issue that
is capable of repetition.

We will, if this Court restores our

21
power, in appropriate circumstances resume 10-day trading
suspensions cn a consecutive but separate basis»
QUESTION :

And use this particular respondent?

MR, PITT;

We have done nothing against this

particular respondent.
QUESTION:

Doesn't Weinstein v. Bradford say that

it has to be capable of repetition with respect to each of the
parties?
MR. PITT;

I believe Weinstein v. Bradford and

DeFunis v. odegaard both support that proposition, your Honor.
QUESTION:

But this respondent has filed an

affidavit or claims that he owns what, soma 400 different
securities?
MR, PITT:

He has now changed that in his brief
: s t ’■'

on the merits(which we just received,to allege 150 securities,
.12 of which have bean the subject of consecutive suspensions,
QUESTION:

And. the Commission suspends, what, 20 or 33

different securities each year?
MR. PICT:
tively.

Something along that line, yes, consecu­

We suspend more, but only about 20 a year on a

consecutive basis.
QUESTION:

And has done so every year as a matter of

historic fact?
MR. PITT:

That is correct.

QUESTION s

I'm not a mathematician.

I suppose it's

22

according to how probable on® thinks capability of repetition
is required,, but anybody who owns that many securities and if
you are suspending that much trading in separata securities eveiy
single year, eventually those lines are going to meet, and that's
capable of repetition yet evading review with respect to this
party.
MR. PICT:

We would concede, and we did set forth, a

probability formula which suggests one possible analysis.
We would concede that it is possible that a stock that the
respondent owns may be subject to consecutive suspension.

But

even if that is true, that does not reach the second phase of
the Southern Pacific case, which is whether this matter is a
matter that evadas review.

And for that question it depends on

the kind of review that is sought.

If the review that is scaight

is of the statutory authority of the Commission to suspend
trading for more than one 10-day period, that xs a question which
we believe does not evade review ®van if this Court holds that
the lower court's decision should fee vacated for mootness.

After

all, this respondent could have: don® what the respondents in
others of the cases that have been held not to be moot did,
namely, instituta a district-court action seeking declaratory
relief and an injunction.
In fact, however, that is precisely what this
respondent did in 1974, and what is surprising to us is he
made that claim and challenged our trading suspension authority

23

both as to constitutional basis, successive basis, and abuse
of discretion.

The district court ruled on the merits and

claimed that the allegations were frivolous.

The Court of

Appeals for -the Second Circuit affirmed, and this Court denied
certiorari„

And our concern is —
QUESTIONS

He took that as a lesson never to try

that route again.
(Laughter.)
MR. PITT:
now filed a petition.

Indeed, he has learned well.

So he has

If this Court ware to hold, as we

think it probably must, that the Second Circuit's decision
should b© vacated for mootness viewed in the capacity in which
the case was presented there, we would be loath to see the
sam© sequence of events that occurred in 1974 commence all
over again.

In a sense, even the Government needs some

protection against repetitive litigation.
In sum —
QUESTION:

In sum we should not dispose of this on

MR. PITT:

I am constrained tc advise the Court

mootness«

that my reading of the cases suggests that the ease was moot
at the time the Second Circuit decided it.

W© would like to

see a decision on the merits.
QUESTION:

Because of the procedure that he followed.

MR. PITT:

That is correct.

24
QUESTIONs

— i.e,» asking the Court, of Appeals to

review certain specific suspension orders.
MR. PITT:

It is certain that we will be back in

district court again as soon as the decision is vacated.
In sum, the CommissionEs construction of section
12(k) has been used to maintain fair and orderly capital
markets.

We believe that the decision below weakens the

capacity of the Commission in an unfair manner to monitor the
securities markets and urges that this Court reverse the
decision of the court below.

QUESTION;

Are you aware that the rules of the

Court require that counsel when they are to argue must register
with the Deputy Clerk in Room 22-D at 9 a.m. or shortly after
that on the day assigned for argument?
MR. SLOAN;

You better check your mail because ycu

are in violation of that rule.

You did not appear here until

2;30 today* and the Court eanct organize its business if it
doesn’t know that arguing counsel is going to be present.
Mow ycu may proceed.
MR, SLOAN;

Thank you very much,

Gentlemen* Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the
Court;

My name is Sam Sloan.

I believe this is a simple case.

Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act gives the SEC the
authority to suspend trading in a security for a period not
©seceeding 10 days.

Here the SEC has suspended trading in a

security for 370 days.

Therefore, the SEC is violating the

statute* and the Court of Appeals under the circumstances was
required to enjoin the SEC from continuing this practice which
it has continued over a period of 3$ years.
They say the case is moot.

But the problem that

anyone has in objecting to this procedure of the SEC is the
problem I face because * as the SEC has pointed out,I started
a case back in 1974 protesting the trading suspensions in
Canadian Javelin Ltd., and these suspension3 continued and 1

25
lost that case.

Then I came back with a petition for review

in the Court of Appeals again protesting the trading suspensions
of Canadian Javelin Ltd. and I lost that case.
Finally -- the reason I lost the second case was
because the SEC said they were going to give me an administra­
tive hearing.,
hearing.

I applied to the SEC for an administrative

They waited until they were ready to enter their

last trading suspension order, and they did so, and at the same
time they denied my request for administrative hearing, thus
putting ms back into the Court of Appeals for the third time.
Now they say because of their delays and because
they ran me around for approximately two years prior to getting
me back into the Court of Appeals by making a bunch of
suggestions such as the suggestion that they were going to
give me an administrative hearing which in fact they did not
give me, that the case has become moot upon expiration of the
consecutive 10-day — the last order which was timed to
coincide with the denial of my request for a hearing.
I don't believe that a Government agency can be
allowed to put a person in this kind of position where they
are controlling the case, where they are deciding at what
point I can object to their procedure, and they can then
manipulate the facts in such a way to say the case is moot
before I have ever had an opportunity to present ray claims.
Now they say that the action of the SEC can only

27
be reviewed by a court in an abuse-of-discretion situation.
Well, as the Court is well aware, if you file a petition for
review in the Court bf Appeals — Not'/, I tried that procedure
in the district court»

1 lost.»

The SEC said my exclusive

remedy was to file a petition for review in the Court of
Appeals»

So since they told me what my remedy was, I pursued

that remedy.

1 filed a petition for review in the Court of

Appeals, and when I got up there they at that point said this
really wasn’t ray remedy, I should go back to the Commission
where they

would give me an administrative hearing.
Now, in the situation where they say a court may

review a case on a matter of abuse of discretion, the question
arises —
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume at

10 o'clock, tomorrow morning.
(Whereupon, at 3 p.m., the oral argument in the
above-antitied matter was recessed, to reconvene at 10 .-•»
on Tuesday, March 28, 1978.)
