MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Fruechtenicht, you may proceed whenever you are

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE E. FRUECHTENICHT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR, FRUECHTENICHT:

Mr. Chief Justice, may the Court

pleas©:
As the document indicates, I represent Harold Stump,
petitioner in this matter»
u

Would you raise your voice a little, counsel.

MR. FRUECHTENICHT:

Yes, sir.

I represent Harold

Stump, ei J I would 11he to identify my client.
Cir- iS.'c i -Klgo of DoKalb County, Indiana.

He is the

DeKalb Ccmnty lies

in the northeastern part of the state, just next to Ohio, about.

000 rf sidents occupy ihe county.
own of about 6,000 people.

The; judge lires there.
0

The county seat is Auburn,

That, is where the courthouse is.

That is where he works.

There is only a single judge in that county?

HR. FRUECHTENICHTs

This action occurred, Your Honor,

1. 1971, amd. at that time he was the sole court of general
jurisdiction.
He has been elected four times sac? 1b now serving hi;.
20i-h yeu-r.

'Iis fsthor, Walter S0\:m,y, served as? a circuit cour!

4
judge on the some bench for 12 years before him.

Judge stump is.

a judge of considerable experience, and I will indicate te 'ii»is
court a judge of the highest integrity.
Q

The important issue, of course, is the scop.-

of

his jurisdicfcicn.

MR. FRUECHTENICHT:

That is correct, Your Honor.

Tka

issue, tbs principal issue, is whether the doctrine of judicial
immunity should be applied to an approval

signed by Judge

Stump of a petition filed by the mother and sole guardian of
a 15-year-old girl to have surgery performed upon her.

That

surgery was a tubal ligation.
The larger issue, I would submit to this Court, would
be whether the doctrine of judicial immunity should be per­
mitted to be, in my view, diluted end altered by the pronounce­
ments of the opinion of the Seventh Circuit. Court of Appeals.
The context in which the matter was presented or is
presv-.nt-iA --the factual background so far as tha judge is
omcoraed—is as follows.

The mother, Ore McFarlin, determined

that apparently because of facts set out in the petition, her
d:lighter, 15 years old, should have a tubal ligation.
petition speaks for itself.

The

It is set forth in the brief of

the respondents along with the approval.

Briefly it suggests

alleges under oath that the daughter is sexually promiscuous,
she has been uncontrollable, 'that, the mother is concernod
obviously that tha da’aghter is going to become pregnant, and

5
that: for the best interests of the child, she. asks that the
court approve a petition by the mother to have a tubal ligation
performed upon her.
When that petition was presented to the court by the
mother and her attorney, the court then was required to make e.
primary threshold decision, and that was whether or not he had
jurisdiction to approve that petition.

He, I submit to ihr

Court, nw.ae this decision as courts of general jurisdiction in
every county, every day throughout this country must make in
matters of this particular type.
Q

How many of these do

MR. FRUECHTENXCHT:
Q

we have in the country?

I beg your pardon?

How many cases do we have in the country where

a mother asks for—
MR. FRUECHTENXCHTs

I am talking about courts of

gsnxral jurisdiction, Your Honor—
Q

Oh.

MU. FRUECHTENXCHT:

—required to make decisions of

this particular type in ©very county throughout the nation.
At that time the court realized that he had a > -r •:

1

jurisdiction statute under which ha functioned, and that
general jurisdiction statute in broad language, enacted by tlx5
Legislature of the Stats of Indiana and to this d&to unamended-,
indicates that he shall have original, exclusive jurisdiction in
all cases at law and equity whatsoever.

And he shall have

6
jurisdiction of all other causes, matters, and proceedings.
Also in existence—Q

Is there not—

MR. FRUECHTENICHT:
Q

I beg your pardon.

Is thesre not some limitation on that if it is

not assigned to some other court?
MR. FRUECHTENICHT:
Honor,

I am sorry.

Yes, sir, Your

if it is not conferred—where exclusive jurisdiction

thereof is not conferred by law upon soma other court, board,
or officer, that is correct.
Q

In other words, he would not have probate

jurisdiction, for example*
MR., FRUECHTENICHT:

H® would.

He would?

Q

MR. FRUECHTENICHTs
Q

Yes, he would in this case.

But there would be. some jurisdiction that he

would not have?
MR. FRUECHTENICHT:

I cannot think of it except where

Q

Are there no other layers of courts—

MR. FUECHTENICHTr

None.

He has criminal jurisdic-

jwvsnil© jurisdiction; he has civil

jurisdiction; he. has

iba ;©nfiral jurisdiction over all causes, matters, and

7
proceedings.

With 'this in raind> also th-are ware net juristic-

tional statutes in existence buf; there wore statutes in
existence in the State of Indiana at that time which in r. - * 1
osrms permitted parents to consent to medical treatment on
behalf of their minor children.

There arcs two such statute,

o.i'.s for people who are incompetent by reason of minority ,
insanity, mental illness, imbecility, idiocy, senility,
habitual drunkenness, and the like.

And the other is simply

a:iy person who is the parent of a child shall be competent to
giva consent to and contract for medical or hospital care cr
of such child, including surgery.
Q

What if—

MR. FRUECHTENICHT•
"

I beg your pardon.

i'<nat -!.f t: rs. McB'arlm had presented a piece of

Bx’m ©reader, especially a court such as; judge Stump—
Q

Assume that this court did do that.

8
MR. FRUECHTENICHT:
Q

If he did do that.

You say that a parent can have surgery dons on

behalf of a child, and here let us assume in ray case that the
court had. ordered that operation cn that representation by the
parent.

Would you be making the same argument?
MR. FRUECHTENICHT:

If I may respectfully suggest,

Your Honor, that assumption is not germane to the issues in
this particular case.
Q

I think it tests your argument, if I may say sc.

MR. FRUECHTENICHT:
Q

Is there

mutilation as there ere statutes in most states against the
mutilation of the human body?
MR. FRUECHTENICHT:

If there is, Your Honor, I am

I am unaware of it.

In answer to your question, Your Honor, that would
be an .appropriate action on the part of a judge.

It is

Q

Do you concede that, this action was at least

Your premise was that she was a

kleptomaniac.
Q

That the mother said she was.

MRo FRUECHTENICHT:

Yes.

Certainly cutting off her

hand, is not going to improve her physically.
Q

Do you think this improved this child physically,,

this operation?
MR. FRUECHTENXCHT:

decision was mad®.

I think, Your Honor, that

And from the standpoint, of improving her

physically, it was at least surgery.

And at least surgery

under these circumstances is permitted by the statute.

And

it is within -the context of that statute that this particular
approval was mada.
Q

But so would it be in my hypothetical case.

MR, FRUBCHTENICHT:

Then you are entitled to that,

This is one that I most certainly do

And I do not; think that a court of general

a petition.

There is no

Q

So, the question is whether he acted for the

right reason or not?
MR. FRUECHTENICHT:

That is not the question.

Tics

final question, Your Honor, is whether ha had jurisdiction to
act at all.
Q

Did he have jurisdiction to decide the example

that: Justice Stewart gives you?
MR. FRUECHTENICHTs

Of chopping, off their hands?

In

the final analysis, yes, he would have jurisdiction to act.
What he would do, I am suggesting, under those circumstances
is refuse.

n@ would refuse to consent.
Q

But your argument is that if he did give

consent, because he had jurisdiction, he would have judicial
immunity?
HR. FRUECHTENICHT:
Q

Yes.

Was this an action -it law or on equity?

MR. FRUECHTENICHT:

This was not an action at law or

in equity, Your Honor.
Q
MR

Where did he get jurisdiction?
FRUECHTENICHT:

He. got jurisdiction by virtue of

dm provisions of fch© general jurisdiction statute which permits
hin to have jurisdiction of all other matters, causes, and
proceedings.
Q

Doss that include admiralty?

MR. FRUECHTENICHT:

Yes., 1 would assume so, if there

11
is such & thing in DeKala County, Indiana,

I think they have

Q

Streams that are navigable?

MR. FRUECHTENICHT:
Q

Yes, they do.

S•breams that are navigable.

MR. FRUECHTENICHT:

Yes.

I believe that is deflived

Q

Do they have jurisdiction over bankruptcy?

Q

No, that is federal law.

term, you do not mean everything.
MR. FRUECHTENICHT:

of course, not.

He has jurisdic

receiverships—those are insolven­

cies .
Q

Could he entertain n petition of a man to hare

Mrs.. Johr Doe sterilised, Mrs. John Doe being no relation at
all?
MR. FRUECHTENICHT:
Q

No.

Why not?

MR. FRUECHTENICHT;

I do not think he would have

jurisdiction. Your Honor,
Q

Why not?

MR. FRUECHTENICHT:

Because there has to be som©

reason for him to b© presented with a petition.

He cannot

12
simply ait back and say, "This morning I think I will simply
have somebody sterilized."

The matter obviously must be

presented to him.
Q

A petition was filed.

MR. FRUECHTENICHT:
Q

By whom?

By John Jones to have Mary Brown sterilized.

MR. I RUBCBTENICHT;

Okay.

And would the petition-—

'&nr, petition would set forth the reasons why the sterilization
should occur?
Q

The same reason given hero.

MR. FRtJECHTEMICHT:

Obviously 'She difference that you

are suggesting is that John Jones ia not -the natural

Q

What

statute do you have in Indiana that

authorises a parent to sterilize a child without the child’s
permission?
MR. FRUECHTENICHT:

in 1971 there was neither a

statute authorising nor was there a statute barring such a
procedure, Your Honor, and that is significant..
significant in this particular case.
Q

That is

May I suggest this to yen?

When you get through suggesting, will you give

He did not cite a piece of

MR., FRUECHTENICHTs

when this petition was presented

■bo tills court, he was duty-bound at that particular point, to
C'..v".~5::rai::.h wh- thsr he had jurisdiction to decide this particular
case, to act in this case—that is, to issue an approval.

hi • ty come basically from Brad ley v, Fisher, which says this:
po- s:

the power cf determining its own jurisdic­

tion both as to the parties and the subject matter of th© action.
It is well settled that when an inferior tribunal is required to
ascertain and decide upon facts essential to its jurisdiction,
its judgement thereon is conclusive, against collateral attack

14
unless the want of jurisdiction is apparent on the face of the
proceedings."
Q

Now—
The point is, Where is his jurisdiction?

MR. PRUECHTENICHT:

His jurisdiction—I will repeat

again, Ycur Honor-lies in the general jurisdiction statute,
as pointed cut by the District Court, which gives him jurisdic­
tion

over all other causes, matters, and proceedings.
Q

Does the supreme court of your state have the

same jurisdiction?
MR. FRUECHTENICHT:
appellate jurisdiction.

I cannot be certain.

It has

I do not think it has original

jurisdiction of this type.

It may have.

But may I suggest

this or may I offer this also, Your Honor, that in 1971 the
parental consent statutes had not in any way been construed by
In other we: -Is, they had not been amended by

any court.

legislation :ior had any court construed the consent statute so
as to prohibit certain, types of surgery.
So, when yen say, "Was there a statute permitting s.

to consent to on appendectomy or £ tonsillectomy, non© of that...
But, on the other hand, there was not a statute that said he

Q

Was tliis petition filed in court?

MR. FRUECHTENICHT:

This petition was presented to

the judge, Your Honor, and any suggestion that it was not is
totally without base.
Q

That was not my question.

Is there any record

MR. FRUECHTENICHT:
Q

Ho, sir.

MR. FRUECHTENICHT:

It does mean that the mother is eventually

The girl married a couple of years

And approximately four years after the incident

occurred, some time in 1975, through investigation it was
disclosed that indeed a tubal ligation had occurred.

That is

when an e.ction was commenced in the federal district court
under 42 USC 1983, in which the mother was sued along with the
judge, the lawyer, three doctors, and a hospital.
The opinion of the federal district court is the one
which this petitioner feels should be restored because that
opinion deals with this problem we think appropriately and
correctly in that it appropriately and correctly applies the
doctrine of judicial immunity.
The federal district judge, Judge Eschfcach, had no
difficulty in finding that this, bring a court of general
jurisdiction, that court being entitled to entertain all types
of causes, matters, and proceedings, most specifically under­
took this act albeit not in an adversary proceeding—undertook

That case was brought because there obviously was a

21

a question as to whether or not a. parent could concent under
the consent statuta to have a tubal ligation performed upon a
minor child.

In that case a declaratory judgment action was

filed, and Indiana then determined as a matter of policy—the

But once again that decision—once

All it did was say if somebody walked

in to Judge Stump today with a petition to have a tubal ligation

But his action would be,

'I am now aware of the fact that in Indiana there is a policy
against permitting parents to do so, and I must tell you that I
cannot approve your petition."
But the key to this is that he retains jurisdiction,
suggested in fha brief and suggest to you now the
policy which has been established by Bradley y. Fisher,

ch<:r.

V.

Brigham over a. century ago and consistently applied

federal courts down to this time with respect to the

application of the doctrine of judicial .immunity is similar—
laasu in my vaew arter reading all these cases-“to the policy
which is employed by courts when dealing with criminally
accused people.

And that .is the accused is considered innocent

22
until proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt»

The policy

with respect to judicial immunity is that the court is presumed
iv have jurisdiction until it is shown that he acted in clear
absence of all jurisdiction over the subject matter»
Q

Then, Mr. Fruechtenicht, if Judge Stump had

done what he did in 1966, after the decision of the Indiana
Cv-Ui, fc in A.L. agaxnst G.R.H. , it would have been erroneous as

absence of jurisdiction,
MR. FRUECHTENICHT:
Q

That is correct.

So, your argument would ba the same.

MR. FRUECHTENICHT:

My argument would be, yes.

Under

ci/.cumstances, I would simply say that to assume that a
*

judge of this experience under these conditions would do that
i® beyond at least understanding,
Q

And thare was no adversary process here, and it

might very well be that he did not know of that decision—

Q

It might vary well be.

It might vary well be,

But, in ny event, if he had done what he did,

quils contrary to the precedent of A.L. against G.R.H., your
argument would be precisely the same, would it not?
:iR, FRUECHTENICHT:

Precisely.

And I would say this

with respect to the liability, Your Honor, Qf those additional

23
parties, that under those circumstances then the mother inust he
construed to be dealing at her peril, as the doctors, because
they are presumed to know the law also.
Q

Counsel, is there not a difference between this

proceeding and the G.L.--whatever the initials are—the other

Yes.

That was a suit or a declaratory judgment in

I think, Your Honor, the- failure to appoint -a guardian ad

I must suggest that in every case - v.;-.;: a

mother decidas to sue her husband and where there are children,
tins a children automatically through the mother corae under tho
aegis of the court, and he makes dispositions of those
children's future interests which are extremely important to
that child.

To suggset, as I think maybe the logical inference

of the suggestion that guardians ad litem ought to he appoint- vdto suggest that in each case where a child is the subject of a
mutter having to do with visitation and custody end its future
religious practices in a divorce action, that that child, each
individual child, is entitled to a guardian ad litem and
presumably an attorney would boggle the entire system.

MR. FRUECHTENICHT:

That is correct, Your Honor, in

many instances.
As an example also—and I pointed it out in the reply

OH BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. FINLEY:

ihz Court:

Your Honors, I believe that the questioning today
indicate? what is truly the crux today, and that is that
probably the doctrine of judicial immunity need not come into

play in your decision.

Tho <jtfc.-Jsid.on asked by Mr.. Justice

Powell—Was this not merely sax administrative act, as discussed
in Be pert®Virginia,and non-judicial act, as discussed in

is going to

be the correct and the logical determining decision in this
case.
The conserit statute which authorised the parent to

in ‘the terms of common sense- necessary surgery.

Certainly

Had this very sane

it would be.

My inclination is to say that probably

There was absolutely no—
Q

I know, but ray assumption is that she still

does not get notice and the same unfortunate consequences all
follow.

My inference is they put a copy in the clerk's office.
MR. FINLEY:

Your Honor, at that point I would say

that probably a judicial act occurred, and then it would be
necessary to determina if under our law of judicial immunity
as established by Randall and Bradley and Pierson allows for
a determination of jurisdiction with just subject matter or
also personal jurisdiction, a determination without the
presonce of personal jurisdiction.

My fa©ling is that the

language used in each ore of these three casos, although in
Bradl<m v. Fisher they used the term "subject matter jurisdic­
tion," they really mean personal jurisdiction because' in each of
the instances, parsc-ral jurisdiction was present.
Q

What do you mee i by personal jurisdiction?

MR. FINLEY:

Jurisdiction over the persons so as to

.cerve that person: s right of appeal before the total
deprivation of his due process rights.

and he died.

Suppose you have the opposite.

I would say if it was ccmtsmplafcsd that it would be

Your Honor, in a filing of the case in Sparkman's court,

j

•chirk that that goes to the real basis of the justification
:cor the doctrine of judicial immunity as this Court has
previously set it.
In 1967 when this Court I think last considered
judicial immunity in Pierson v. Ray, it indicatae that they
realized that immunity was a necessary fact for a judge in
ardor to be stoic to act.

But this Court also recognized, as

vs recognized in Bradley aid in Randall that there is a counter."-••alssao© ?nnsrent within the judicial system that protects the
litigant, and that is the right 'to appeal.

Mp- FINLEY •*

If on® were to take the analysis of th;

could bs said that the judge never ©van had t© be petitioned.
There is the other side to that story again under Trial Rule 17.

48
MR., FINLEY:

No.

No, because I think at that point

But all I mn saying is that I think

maybe you can infer from the opportunities at the end what hitreal intent was, and that was evading the judicial act nature of
it from the beginning.
A judge owes a duty to protect the people brought ir
front of him just as much as he owes a duty to penalise the
people brought in front of him.

But getting back to the

he nevertheless entered the order.

MR. FINLEY:

judicial .act., and I know it would hem keen clearly outside of

Q

Are you saying that there is no way under the

law of Indiana where, had there been good grounds to do so,

MR. FINLEY:

In 1971 the only way that this child

could have bean sterilised is if she. were an institutionalized,
nontally retarded child and if the procedures were specific;?., vy
followed—

Q

*•’’

But

Is not your response equivalent to saying that

e judicial error in not appointing a guardian ad litem?

53
MR. FINLEY:

No, because I do not think h© got ft.r

enough down the road, Mr. Chief Justice.

He did nothing from

th® very beginning in order to assume jurisdiction.

I do not

must

In other words, is there any law of Indiana that

54
required him to appoint: a guardian ad litem?
MR. FINLEY:

I would say that Trial Rule 17 required

him to appoint, a guardian ad litem if he had a case in front
of him that showed a litigant's rights were being challenged,
Q

Was that not the A.L. case or whatever it was?

MR. FINLEY:

I think A.L. v. G.R.H. clearly—it did

not address itself to that question because it met it in the
proper manner to begin with.

It did appoint a guardian ad

litem to represent the interests of the child.

And I think

that that is the only way a court can properly act.

Otherwise

I can imagine no instance, no matter how gross you want to
make it- - the amputation of one's head is not within the

to

i.h.

general jurisdiction of a court or subject matter jurisdiction
of

court.
Q

from th.it.

We are talking about something quite different
Suppose it was a 17-year-old girl who was a

Christian Science convert and protested against surgery.

Could

the parents consent to having her appendix removed?
MR. FINLEY;

I would think that the court would have

;■ if sdic?ion to hear that case, look at—getting back to
Mr. Just!ce Blackmun's questioning--look at the reasons behind
tee request, determine if, under the Indiana statute of a
parent hiving the power to consent to necessary surgery» to
look at it and look closely? and if he made an error, he is
still en titled to immunity.

There is no question because he

jurisdiction in a judge!IK-a manner.

58
MR. FINLEY:

I think clearly it is :l\ violj-.tic.i of

a subject matter jurisdiction, as most liberally defined, ai
no immunity»

But here that question need not. be reached.

If

it. were reached, I would still say that all three of the
Supreme Court cases previously decided would deny immunity,

if

not, then, as I said earlier, any judge of general jurisdiction
can do anything.

And that cannot be justified with the

previous rationale granting immunity.
And if I may ray one further thing, the last case that
this Court decided I think in giving blanket immunity to
prosecutors in Imbler v. Fachtmar. is not contrary to what- 1 a:a
s.lying he:cause again tho Court was'very careful in pointing
out that what .that prosecutor did was within his prosecutoria;?,
function

A id what Judge Stump did was in no way within his

judicial functioning,

he completely -overlooked—and intention*

ally so—his judicial functions.
