MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 1835, Slodov against the United States.
Mr. Kleinman, you nay proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENNET KLEINMAN ON
BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. KLEINMAN:
please the Court:
Stateso

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

The case before us is Slodov v. United

It acmes to this Court on a writ of certiorari from

the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.

The issue before this

Court is whether under the provisions of Section C672 of the
Internal Revenue Code, the section, incidentally, which was
discussed in the immediately preceding case, whether under
that section cf the Code or any other section of the Internal
Revenue Code Dr. Slodov, the petitioner in this case, is
personally liable for income taxes and social security taxes
withheld from employees of a corporation, withheld prior to
tie time that he became a responsible officer under the
provisions cf this section and which taxes were not paid
over to the Internal Revenue Service by the corporation.
QUESTION:

At any time after he took over, did he

ever have any control of this fund, any fund for the purposes
revolved in this case?
MR. KLEINMAN:

So far as the petitioner is

concerned, the petitioner Slodov came into no funds when he

4
took over the corporation.

The date he took over control of

<-ne corporation, the bank accounts, all the bank accounts of
the corporation had been overdrawn.
QUESTION:

But did the company have some gross

income that was subject to liability for the tax?
Di. I, jEINMAN:
QUESTION:

At that time?

After he took over, did the corporation

have some gross income.
MR. K.iEIRllAN:
QUESTION:

The corporation had gross income.

Which was subject to the tax liability?

MR. KLEINMAN:

No,,

was not subject to the tax.

So far as we are concerned, it
Let me put it this way, the

corporation -QUESTION:

There was a decision to pay some bills

besides the tax.
MR. KLEINMAN;

That's correct.

The corporation

remained liable for that tax liability throughout the entire
pr'ceeding3 —
QUESTION:

And he could have applied that money to

the tax instead of some other liabilities.
MR. KWEINMAN:
QUESTION:

He could have, that is correct.

Let me ask it another way.

These funds

that were available at that time were not encumbered otherwise?
MR. KLEINMAN:

The funds which came into the

corporation after the petitioner took over were not encumbered

5
except, for the fact, that the corporation, and the facts so
indicate, was required to pay c.o.d. for any inventory which
it purchased which, incidentally, gave rise to the gross
income of the corporation.

So that had he not paid these

bills for inventory which he was buying, not paid them
simultaneously: he would have had no income, nothing to sell,
and therefore no money out of which ~~
QUESTION:

Had a lien matured, a tax lien matured

for the withholding tax?
MR. ELEINMAN:

I am not aware whether a tax lien

had been placet upon the assets of the corporation.

I do r.ct

believe that they were, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Then I take it that there was some net

income realized, too.
HR. KLEINMAN:
income.

I do not believe there was any net

In fact, the corporation went bankrupt within six

months after the time Dr. Slc-dov took over control of the
corporation.

It was in very bad financial condition at the

time he took over.

There was no net income, otherwise there

would probably not have been any need for the corporation to
go through the bankruptcy proceeding.
QUESTION:

^

Then I take it your answer to one of the

2a.rl.ier questions is that he did not give first priority to
the old withholding taxes because he had to pay c.o.d. for
everything.

6

MR
your Honor.

'.CLEIMMAN:

It is part of our argument, yes,

But it is also part of our argument that there

was no obligation on anyone's part to give priority to those
payments of taxes out of funds which were acquired by the
corporation at a later date.

There is nothing in Sec. 6672

nor Sec. 7501 of the Internal Revenue Code,which

are the only

two sections I know of by which this petitioner could be held
liable for the tax which gives the Government any priority
over subsequent funds.
Section "'501 which provides for these funds to be
held in trust says that the funds that are withheld and
collected, or ;ax withheld and collected, are held in trust.
Those funds had been dissipated by prior officers of this
corporation before perhaps Dr. Slodov had ever even heard of
this corporation, certainly before he took control on
January 31, there was no money, there were no funds represent­
ing withheld taxes at the time he took over.
QUESTION:

What kind, of an account — you said all

the bank accounts were drawn down to zero.
MR. RLE IffMAN:
QUESTION;

Overdrawn.

Was there a. segregated account for these

funds at any time prior to his takeover?
MR. KLEINMAN:

So far as the record shows, no funds

had ever been segregated which had been withheld or collected.
QUESTION:

In other words, they took the money from

7
the employees and just put it in the general revenues of the
corporation.
MR. KLEIl'MAW:

That is correct.

shows, that is what, happened.

Yes.

So far as the record

They used the funds as

they came in for
QUESTION ;■

For how long a period did that go on?

MR. ELEINMAN:

Well, this went on for quite a

period, although the taxes with which we are involved here are
the few quarters before the time that Dr. Slodov took over.
There were no funds available, that is clear from all of the
evidence the court found.
the bankruptcy court.

Originally this case was tried in

The bankruptcy judge found that the

bank accounts had all been overdrawn.

He found, the bankruptcy

judge, found this petitioner not liable for any taxes which
had bean collected or withheld prior to the: time he took over
control of the corporation.
There was an appeal to the district court and the
district court likewise held this petitioner not liable for
those taxes.

The court appeals, the Sixth Circuit Court of

Appeals, reversed.

The basis on which the lower courts have

held that this petitioner was not liable for the tax was that
me three requirements of making him a responsible person
insofar as these particular taxes are concerned had not converged.
That is to say, Section 6672 provides that any person required
to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over the tax, all

8

three of these provisions are required before a person, even
though a responsible officer at that time, can be held liable
for any taxes which, should have been collected»
QUESTION:

Mr, Kleinman, do you concede that Dr,

Slodov, during the period of his control of the corporation,
which were a few months in 1969, was such a person?
MR. KLEINMAN;

Yes, we concede that, your Honor.

We have no argument with the fact — there was an issue in the
original case as to whether there was any liability on his
part for taxes incurred after he became a responsible officer.
That has been settled to his satisfaction.
QUESTION:

But you do concede that —

MR. KLEINMAN;
QUESTION;

We concede.

— during the time that he was in control

of the corporation, he was the person described in 6672.
MR. KLEINMAN;
the time he took over.

Correct.

He was that person from

We do not concede, however, that he

was. a responsible officer prior to that, and. that is what the
issue is before-: this Court at the present time.
The Government reads *— the Internal Revenue Service,
the Government, and the Sixth Circuit read this statute
differently from the way it is clearly written.

They said

that any person required to collect, truthfully account for,
or pay over any tax„

The statute says "and pay over."

The

two decisions in the lower courts were that these three had to

9

converge.

The} did not converge because the petitioner was

n°t the responsible officer who was required to collect these
taxes for which the Government is now making a claim.
QUESTION:

On the interpretation you have just given,

the distinction between "and" and "or" is the distinction the
Fifth Circuit made,, is it not?
MR. KLEINMAN:
same distinctio:.!.
the Fifth Circuit.

The Fifth Circuit likewise made the

The Government made the same argument in
They said this should be read "or," and the

Fifth Circuit clearly said, that's fine except the principal
difficulty with this argument is that that .is not the way the
statute is written and there is no statutory authority for the
collection of this penalty.

That is the basis for, at least

in one part of our case where there is a conflict between the
Sixth Circuit and the Fifth, and the Sixth Circuit clearly said
that they don't follow the reasoning of the Fifth Circuit
insofar as Section c672 is concerned.
QUESTION:

Then the Court of Appeals in the Sixth-

Circuit went on to explain the difference between this case
and the Fifth Circuit case in terms of whether or not there
were after-acquired assets.
MR. RLEINMAN:
point.

The Fifth Circuit didn't reach that

It specifically said —
QUESTION:

opinion was„

I want to know what the Sixth Circuit

10

MR. KLEINMAN:

The Sixth Circuit said, as I understand

their deedsion, that when funds came in afterwards, not
collected or withheld, but as in this case from vending
machines, from catering fees, from whatever the gross income
was, that somehow a trust was engrafted upon those funds so
i

that his violation of those requirements to clothe those funds
or pay them over to the Government somehow made him liable,
that is, this petitioner liable, for those taxes.
The court cites no law which would indicate that there
was a trust of after-acquired funds.

The trust under .Section

7501 provides that those taxes required to be collected shall
be held ir. trust, in a fund in trust for the Government.

This

money that cane in afterwards, even if it had been free, and
we don't concede that point and thdt may be in issue if this
Court holds as the Sixth Circuit did, it may be in issue as
to whether there were any free funds avail-able and how much
those were and to what extent he could be liable for those
free funds.
However, it is our contention that there is no
Iasi

in any of the decided cases, and several other district

court cases have held that somehow the minute a dollar came in,
.regardless of the fact that it didn't come in from withholding,
the minute it came in and went into the cash drawer, it became
impressed with a trust.

None of the cases which we have read

tv-11,1 indicate what the basis for that determination is.

11
There just, is nothing in Section 6672 or Section 7501, which
are the only

sections we know of whereby this petitioner

could be personally liable for corporate debt.
We read the statute strictly because normally an
individual, an officer of a corporation, is not liable for the
debts of the corporation, as, of course, this Court is well
aware.

It is only where there is some statutory provision,

such as this, that a person becomes personally liable.

And the

statute to us is perfectly clear as to who that person is,
Congress has cast a net to attempt to protect the
revenue so that the person responsible, the individual responsible
for the collection, if he doesn't collect or doesn't pay it
over, shall become personally liable.

But we suggest that

the Sixth Circuit and the Internal Revenue Service has cast
too broad a net.

They are seeking other persons from whom to

collect the tax for which this person had no responsibility.
I might suggest to the Court that even the Internal
P.evenue Service itself was not consistent in stating that the
funds as they came in were impressed with a trust.

The record

is clear, and the appendix filed in this case will indicate
that the Internal Revenue Service insisted during the entire
time that they were attempting to collect this past due tax
during the six months when Dr. Slodov was in charge of the
corporation, they insisted that as funds came in, the current
taxes had to be paid, the current withholding taxes, not the

12

past taxes„

They .anted them to take these funds and pay

current taxes.
Now, if those funds were in fact impressed with a
trust for prior collected taxes, then the Internal Revenue
Service would have insisted that that’s our money, it should
apply to the old taxes and not be applied to the new taxes,.
But it is perfectly clear that that isn’t what happened.

They

themselves insisted that some of these funds, if there was
a diversion of money that came in which we, of course, do not
admit. if there was a diversion, it was by the requirement
not only with the consent but by the requirement of the
Internal Revenue Service that current taxes be paid from those
funds.

So that there was no trust, at least so far as we

are concerned, there was no trust on those taxes for prior
liability.
QUESTION:■

If I understand the Government's theory

correctly, every dollar that came in after the takeover would
have been impressed with this trust, that if any money was
used to pay wages or rent or the light bill or anything, it
would have bee:;:, a violation of the trust.

Does the record show whether they ever

13

ME. KLEINMANi
QUESTION:

Oh, yes.

Did they ever object to paying ordinary

expenses of operations or anything like that?
MR. KLEINMAN:

No.

As a matter of fact, as far as

the record shows, and I think the findings were that they
permitted the corporation to continue to do business,
permitted, in fact insisted, that they pay not only the
salaries and other debts, but these withholding taxes as well,
and in fact had the Government not done that, had they insisted,
had Internal Revenue insisted, said,

"Look, every dollar that

comas in from here on has to be applied to the old taxes that
had been due before," the corporation would have ceased
functioning and as a matter of fact, the Internal Revenue
Service would have been further behind the ball than they
were because there would have been no more money coming in
out of which they could get any money.

And they did get paid

every single collar of withholding taxes for which this
petitioner was responsible.

From the day he; took over-until

:he corporation went into bankruptcy six months later, every
dollar that was owed the Internal Revenue Service for with­
holding and social security tax was religiously accounted for
and paid.
QUESTION:

Does the record show whether they made

any effort to collect from, prior individual officers of the
corporation?

TR„ I .LLI'i-TMAN r

The record is not clear, am. so far

as we know, they have not at least been persistent in attempting
to collect.

I am not even certain that they have made

assessment against the prior officers who we say were obviously
responsible for having dissipated funds which came into their
hands.
It could logically be argued, it seems to me, that
uiiu there been a fund when this petitioner came into the
corporation, had there been such a fund, under the general
rules of trust law, he would have become by interpretation
the successor trustee of that fund and then having dissipated,
he perhaps could have been held liable for dissipating that
trust fund.
On the other hand, to say that these people who
were there before,the responsible person, suppose they paid
the employees an cash and said, "How, give me back the
withholding.

Here is $10; give me a dollar," and they put it

i.v their pocket.

That is certainly the tax withheld.

And

tley went ahead and spent that money, there doesn't seem to
j3

any way that this petitioner should be responsible for

funds over which he had no control and which never came to
aim<

And there is.. I suggest to the Court, no case that we

have discovered that has been decided, and I am tai cLng about
those cases which nave held somehow a trust applies to funds
as they come in, t.aere is no case which has indicated by wnac

15
lav/ or by what authority they have come to this conclusion.
They are broad statements which say the moment another dollar
came in, it was impressed with a trust.

Fven,

however, I

suggest to this Court, that if it was impressed with a trust
under the provisions.of 7501, there is nothing in 7501 which
■■/ould make this petitioner liable for the dissipation of those
funds.

MR. KLEINMAN:

This is a completely different issue

This has to do with whether by lav/, not by facts — facts are
found and are determined and at this point no issue can be
taken with the facts, obviously.

The question is whether by

Whether he is liable at all.

MR. .KLEINMAN:

Whether he is liable in the first

the earlier trials of this matter, your Honor.

So that under 6672, really, the entire issue

1

revolves around the fact of whether or not this petitioner
:.s the responsible officer for these taxes, whether in order
to find him liable for these taxes, the statute would have to
be read with an "or" instead of an "and" where the "and" now
appears.

It seems perfectly unambiguous that the "and" is

there and ought- to be .read thus.
QUESTION:

What if when he came in to the company

hi is company's bank accounts were in good order and the so-called
trust fund was intact.
MR. KLE IK MAN:

Then his obligation, if thsS Court

please, would be under the provisions of the general trust law,
that there was a trust fund over which he took control and
now he dissipated.

He would not be liable under 6672, because

he was not the responsible officer to collect and withhold

18

those taxes.

He coo Id perhaps, as 1 suggested, be held by-

reason of violating —
QUESTION:

It is a disjunctive between the collect

and die accounting and paying over, it is an or, it does say “or.
MR. KLEINMAN:

Once you have determined the

responsible officer, then when he fails to perform any one of
those acts, he is liable.

But to hold him as a responsible

officer, the statute says, "Any person required to collect,
truthfully account for, and pay over."
QUESTION:

It says "collect or."

MR. KLEINMAN:

No.

No, it says who fails to collect,

truthfully account for, or pay.

But we are talking about

whether he is the person that they are referring to.
"any person."

Who is the person?

required to collect

They say

The person is the one

account for, and pay ever.

Those were

the officers of this corporation before Dr. Slodov came in.
AIJ. three of the requirements converged on those officers.
They ware required to collect, -they were required to account
for, and they ware required to pay, all three.

Once they are

determined to have been the responsible officer, if they failed
to do any one of those things, in the disjunctive admittedly,
then they are liable.

But you must first determine whether
/

Dr

Slodov was in fact that person.
QUESTION:

Such person, is the word the statute uses.

MR. KLEINMAN:

Any person

required to collect,

19
truthfully account for, and pay over — I am reading from the
statute — any ::ax imposed by this title who willfully fails
to collect such tax,, or truthfully account for and pay over such
tax.

In other words, once you have, established that the

individual is the person that they are talking about as the
one who is required to collect, account for, and pay and he
fails either to collect, either to account for, or to pay,
then he becomes liable.

But you cannot find the individual

who bears this responsibility until you have made the
determination that all three of these requirements were met.
Mow, the Government's argument is that this leads to
strategic shifts which could avoid liability on any person.
For example, an individual is required to collect but leaves
i

the corporation control before the payment date for the tax.
Now, they say,

somebody else comes in and he is only required

Therefore, neither one of them have all three

obligations at any one time.

But that is not true, and the

courts in the Tael and Tiffany cases, which are cited in our
brief, have indicated that the party required to collect also
has the burden of accounting and paying that tax.

So he is

the party, the one who collects it.

then you import general principles of trust law, is that it?
MR. KLEINMAN:

That's correct.

That's true.

That

would be the basis on which he could be held.
Now, I believe that the other courts, I think with
the exception of Teel, perhaps, have said — in the McCullough
case in the Fifth Circuit, the court said, "We do not reach
the question of whether there would be a liability if when he
became the responsible officer, the fund was there."

They said

they didn't reach that point.
In :he other cases, however, they have loosely

22

combined (>672 and 7501, in fact mixed them up, to first decide
under 6672 there is no liability, but then there is a trust
that is created

on the new funds that come in, again which I

say there is nc legal authority for creating such a trust.
The Government is attempting to give them some priority in
payment out of monies that 'were not in the trust fund to begin
with and that were not intended under 6672 to be part of that
fund.
Now, under Section 7501, as I stated, there could
be -- there would be, in fact — a trust for e.ny funds collected.

because if you don't relate such tax to collected taxes, then
the corporate income tax, the corporate share of the social
security tax, any other Federal tax Which .s not withheld and
collected could be collected from the individual.

I don't

trim the Government has ever taken that position, except that
it appears:

in his brief when it serves their purpose to say

such tax does not mean collected taxes, it means any tax.
It doesn't mean any tar.

If means such tax, that is

tie rax required to be collected, accounted for, and paid,
he had no responsibility with such tax, only the tax for a

subsequent, period.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

If you wish to save any

time for rebuttal —MR. KLEINMAN:

Yes, I do.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
at your own convenience,

Mr. Barnett, at sometime

I wish you would indicate whether

there is an. obligation on the part of the Government to pursue
the predecessors of Dr. Slodov and if the record shows anything
about pursuit of them, point that out.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. BARNETT ON
BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BARNETT:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

The answer is that the record is entirely silent

or. the question of whether the Government did or did not pursue
the predecessors in this case.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Then if you will at some

point pursue whether there is an obligation or. the. part cf
the Government to pursue them.

You don't need the record for

that purpose.
MR. BARNETT:

The Government takes the position,

your Honor, as was stated in the Sotello argument this
...
morning, that it never will collect more than .1inn name

.rz

ilia taxes due, and thus the Government would not go out to the
predecessor and the successor and try to get more than 100
percent.

Now, whether the Government has an obligation to go

after the predecessor first just because the predecessor was
there first, I doubt that.
QUESTION:

If there is any default here, are they

not the primary defaulters?
MR. BARNETT:

As between the predecessor and the

successor; they may be as a matter of private law between
those parties, but we say that under the Internal Revenue
Rode each is liable to the Government and the Government, like
any creditor who has two debtors liable for the same debt,
can take ills choice I should think as to which one to go
after first so long as it does not collect more than the total
from both of them.
There are a few aspects of the facts here which,
while the facts are undisputed, I believe deserve brief
emphasis.
First of all, it is undisputed that after ^eti-loner
purchased the stock of the three corporations, as of January 3
he was thereafter in complete control of the corporation for
the relevant period.

It is also undisputed that when

petitioner took control of the corporations, he knew that the
withholding taxes in question here had previously been with­
held from the employees' wages and were due to the Government.
This fact is unusually clear here because immediately after
caking control

petitioner sent off to the Internal Revenue

Service corporate checks for the withholding taxes.

Two days

26
later he discovered that there was no money in the bank to
cover those checks and he immediately stopped payment on them.
QUESTION:

Mi at significance should we attach to

that?
MR, BARNETT:

Siraplv that it makes quite clear that

he knew of the liability and thus it could not be suggested —
QUESTION:

Of the corporation.

IIR, BARNETT:

Of the corporation's liability.

The third point which -QUESTION:

Mr. Barnett, what was his duty at that

point?
MR, BARNETT:

Well, his duty at that point and

thereafter was when the corporation came into funds ■—
QUESTION,

Say he got a hundred dollar check in, he

iad an employee there who earned a hundred dollars in wages.
Should he have not paid, the employee and given all that money
to the Government?
MR,, BARNETT:

It isn't a question of a hundred

dollars.
QUESTION:

Every cent that came in should have

immediately been turned over to the Government, is that your
position?
MR,. BARNETT:

That was his statutory liability

before -~
QUESTION;

Did the Government ever assert that

27
position to him?
MR. BARNETT:
position to him.

No., the Government didn’t assert that

In fact, the record shows that the amount

that came in every week during his tenure was $130,000 that
came in per week and was deposited.

So we are not talking

about $100.
But it is true, Mr. Justice Stevens, the Government
apparently did not tell him, "You have got to pay us everything
first on pain of going out of business."
Service in these cases is flexible.

The Internal Revenue

It would rather keep the

business going if possible so that eventually it could collect
the taxes due from the corporation rather than 'from an
individual.
If bankruptcy does ensue, the Government has recourse
under Section 6672

to collect it from the individual who was

responsible, who d d make this choice to try to keep the
business going rather than pay the Government.
QUESTIONs

Placing him in a terrible dilemma.

If

you let him cro along and he goes into bankruptcy, then you
stick him.
MR. BARNETT:
as well.

Yes.

Well, he is stickable originally

It isn’t as if he is more stickable in bankruptcy

th.ar he is as soon as he comes into control and as soon as
money is available that would cover the liabrlity to the
Government which"he applies tc other

corporate debts instead.

28
QUESTION:

Then it is your position that he should

liquidate immediately.
MR„ BARNETT:
if he makes the choice
QUESTION:

Well, that is his statutory liability;
•—•

It’s a Hobson's choice you give him.

MR. BARNETT:

Well, in a sense it's a Hobson's choice.

The cases have dealt with this problem and have made clear
that while a statute may seem harsh, the statute is designed
\

to protect the revenue to make sure that these taxes owing
are collected.
Now, after all, the corporation is benefiting from
these withheld taxes.
QUESTION:

So was the Revenue Service, as you

describe it in its flexible position, wasn’t it, Mr. Barnett,
that if they did bail this thing out, which was a real
loser at the time the petitioner took over, the Government
would eventually get all of its tax money.

So it has the

same incentive as lots of creditors do to Let. him try to hang
in there and pull the thing out.
MR. BARNETT:

That is true, but he has not asserted

here that there was any agreement on the part of the Government
that if you carry the business on, we will absolve you of the
statutory liability.
QUESTIONt
agreement,

But under your theory, it didn't take an

He was under an immediate duty to liquidate under

29
the statute.
MR. BARNETT:

Well, as soon as he had money available

that would have paid the Government, he was under a duty to
pay the Government first and if that required litigation —
QUESTION:

Mr. Barnett, why do you say as soon as he

had money available?

I take it you mean as soon as the

corporation had money available.
MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:
liability?

Yes.

Why does that affect his personal

Under your theory, if I read the statute your way,

10 minutes after he took over, he became the person required
to account: for, collect, and pay over, whatever the words are.
Why wasn't: he immediately liable for the full amount?
MR. BARNETT:

Because he is liable only through a

willful failure to do that.
QUESTION:

But we have established he knew about it.

MR. BARNETT:

Yes, but a willful failure means that

you prefer other creditors.
QUESTION;

There is nothing about preferring other

creditors in the word "willful" as I understand the cases.
MR. BARNETT:

The cases are clear cn the meaning

of "willful."
QUESTION:

It means he has to know --

MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

He has to have a choice.

He had a choice.

He had. personal assets

30

he could have used.
MR. BARNETT:

Oh, no.

You have to have a choice

out or: corporate assets.
QUESTION:

Why if it is a personal liability

QUESTION:

The statute doesn’t say that.

QUESTION:

Yes, but there has to be some failure.

Is not only has to be in that category of people required to
collect and pay over, but he has then to fail, he has to then
willfully fail to collect, willfully fail to account for or
%

willfully fail to pay over.
MR.. BARNETT:

That’s right.

QUESTION:

So it is after that time he has to be —

QUESTION;

This was a corporation with substantial

assets, was it not?

Fixed assets.

It had the wherewithal

to liquidate and pay that debt right away, it didn't have to
wait for incoming receipts, did it?
MR. BARNETT:

The record doesn’t indicate that.

The

record indicates that it had —
QUESTION
wasn’t it?

It generated income of $130,000 a month,

You mean to say.with no assets he did chat?
MR. BARNETT:

I don't know, the record, doesn’t

i'dicate.
I think the answer is that it is a corporate tax
and he has to truthfully account — he has to fail to collect,
truthfully account for, and pay over such tax.

Therefore, he

31

is liable only when the corporation has money which he diverts
to another purpose.
QUESTION;

Mr. Barnett, when did he become liable

for that?
MR. BARNETT:

He became liable when the corporation

obtained sufficient funds that would have paid the taxand he decided not to use them for that purpose.
QUESTION:

Why wasn't he liable when fye first took

over?
MR. BARNETT:

Because the corporation at that point

did not have sufficient funds to pay the tax.
QUESTION:

How much funds does it have now?

MR. BARNETT:

It's bankrupt now: I assume it has

none.
QUESTION:
ha gets caught.

I don't sea the difference except that

You couldn't have then said, "You are about

to be bankrupt so you put the money up.”
MR. BARNETT:

Well, we couldn't have said that he

must put it up out of his own money —QUESTION:

That's right.

MR. BARNETT:

But once he had collected money

available and —
QUI 1TI0N:

corporation went bankrupt.

MR. BARNETT:

When the corporation went bankrupt.

32
ha becomes liable under 6672 ~QUE§TION:

Automatically.

MR. BARNSTTs

— because he was the parson in control

of the corporation who willfully failed to have the corporation
pay its taxes, and he did that by having the corporation use
the corporate funds and prefer other creditors over the
Government with those funds.
QUESTION!

Are you saying that the first $177,000,

the amount that is involved here, that came into the corporation
after the moment of his takeover had to be funneled right to
the Government?
MR., BARNETT:
liability, yes.

Technically, as a matter of statutory

Now, in practice, the Service is willing to

go along in the hope that the corporation will make it, but
he could have made chat choice.
QUESTION

You say it's at his risk.

If he uses

it for something else, even though the United States stands
aside and let's him do it, if he used it for something else,
that•s his risk.
MR, BARNETT:

Yes, and the cases are clear on that,

for example, the Monday case, cited at pages 19 and 20 of our
i

brief, the court there charged the jury that "willful" under
this statute means that you fail to pay the tax without
justifiable excuse or without reasonable cause.

This charge

was held to be error because it invites consideration of such

33

misleading and improper factors as the financial condition
of the business or the demands of the creditors.

The Mueller

case, cited in our brief at page 12, held, "Absent stringent
measures to protect these funds, they might easily be available
to finance a business in hazardous or failing condition.
QUESTION 2

That might be — your friend.might agree

with you except his position is he never does become liable
under this particular statutory section to pay any tax that
accrued prior co that time.
MR. BARNETT:
now.

You haven’t addressed that.

No, I haven't.

However, I will try to

Under the language of the statute, Section 567.2 which

appears in the appendix to our brief, the crucial language
is,, "Any person required to collect, truthfully account for,
and pay over any tax imposed by this title who willfully fails
to collect such tax," and sc forth.
Now, the petitioner reads this to mean that the
person has to be required to collect, truthfully account for,
and pay over particular tax monies and thus he argues that
here the petit, oner Was required, as

he concedes, to pay over

these taxes after the petitioner came into control o; the
company but was not required to collect them originally and
therefore is not covered by this language.
QUESTION:

He concedes that he was required to do

all three things once he became in control,,
MR. BARNETT:

With respect to taxes that accrued

34
after that.
QUESTION:

Thereafter.

But he simply is not a

person identified in 6672 with respect to taxes that were
collected before he took over.
MR. BARNETT%

Yes.

Now, we say as a matter of both

the language and tha purpose of the statute and the authorities,
the statute does not mean that.

What it means is that

petitioner here at the time after he took over the corporations
was, as he concedes, the responsible officer.

That, is, he was

required at that time and thereafter to collect, truthfully
account for, and pay over any tax imposed by this title, e.g.,
the withholding taxes of income and social security faxes that
are imposed by oh is time on the corporation.

He was required

continually to pay those taxes for the corporation, and he
failed to truthfully account for and pay over those taxes, the
particular ones that had previously been, collected.

That is,

the reference to any tax imposed by this title and -the
subsequent reference back

in the word "such tax" is to a

generic tax, the withholding tax.

It is not to particular tax

dollars.
V

Support for this, incidentally, can be found in the
words of the statute itself in another section.

If one looks

at Section 6671(a), which is printed in the appendi:;; ho our
for;.ef, page la, right over 6672, in 6671(a) the final sentence
reads, "Except as otherwise provided, any reference in this

35

title to 'tax' imposed by this title shall be deemed also to
refer to the penalties and liabilities provided by this
subchapter."
Now, the purpose of this section, of course, is
not relevant here.

The purpose of this section is to equate

taxes with penalties.
QUESTION:

Even if you are right as to your generic

interpretation of any tax imposed by this title

in the first

clause of Section 6672, that still doesn’t answer your opponent's
contention, that the phrasing is in the conjunctive, that
before that liability is imposed on him, he has to be required
to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over.
MR. BARNETT:
Relinquish.

I think it does answer that, Mr. Justice

We contend that he was required after he took

control of the corporations to collect, to truthfully account
for, and to pay over the corporations5 withholding taxes, the
generic withholding taxes.

So he was required to do all three,

and \a are not saying that "and" should be read as or.
QUESTION:

He couldn't do all three.

MR. BARNETT:

Well, that goes back to the other

point«
QUESTION:

you are.
MR. BARNETT:

Well, we are only trying to be as

technical as petitioner.
The point I was trying to make with respect to 6671(a)

may illustrata this.

What is relevant about 6671(a), we would

submit, is tha way it uses the phrase “tax imposed by this
title,” the same phrase in 6672.

The context in 6671(a) where

taxes are equated with penalties indicates, we suggest, that
the Congress is talking there about tax imposed by this title
in the generic sense of the whole tax, a withholding tax, not
in the sense of particular tax money,
QUESTION:

Mr, Barnett, the word "title."

Doesn't that refer to the whole Internal

Revenue Cede?

MR. BARNETT;

that he is the person required to •—
QUESTION:

From whom was Dr, Slcdov required to

collect the tar for the past period before January 31, 1969?
MR., BARNETT:

No one for the past period, but we do

not agree that this refers to the past period.

We view this

as meaning collect, truthfully account for, and pay over at a
\

particular point in time.

And he was required to do all

tiree with respect to the continuing ongoing withholding taxes
after he took over.
The basic problem here, Mr. Justice Stevens, is that
you have got an inevitable time lag between the time of
withholding end the time that the taxes are paid over to the
Government,
Now, petitioner's argument that the person

to be

1 table under 6672 has to be required to collect, truthfully
toccunt for, and pay over with respect to particular dollars
would mean the : whenever there was a change in who is the
responsible person, that neither of them can be liable because
neither the first guy nor the second guy is required to do
all three as to particular dollars.
QUESTION.

His answer to that is that if he has

collected and recounted for it, he has an ongoing obligation
ho be sure it's paid, so there is an obligation on him.
MR. GARNETT:
not correct,

Yes, but his answer, I am afraid, is

he relies on the cases of Teel and

QUESTION:

Teel and Tiffany„

MR. BARNETT:

And we read them differently.

It seems

to us that, they support --QUESTION:

Those cases say you could read the

statute the way -MR. BARNETT:

Those cases, particularly Teel and

Tiffany —QUESTION:

And I feel sure if the Government had

that problem with a person, say you had the; predecessor before
you, I am sure the Government would be asserted that the
predecessor had an obligation.
MR. BARNETT:

Yes, and Teel and Tiffany so hold.

But our position is that that supports our argument, because
the c-nly basis on which they could so hold, the only basis
on which the predecessor can be held liable when in fact he
was not around at the time of paying over must be that our
interpretation of the .statute is correct.

otherwise,, -those

canes would have to be decided differently.
Petitioner in his brief quotes from the Tee., case
at page 10 of petitioner's brief where the taxpayer in Teel
•had made the argument that he could not be liable for the taxes
accrued, during the month of November because by the time it was
time for those taxes to be paid over, a receiver was there and
he therefore was not required to pay them over.
Now, that is exactly the converse of petitioner's

40

argument, and if petitioner is right that all three requirements
must converge, then this taxpayer would have won, but the
taxpayer lost, and the reason must be that our interpretation
is correct that, the taxpayer in Teel was required to do all
tJhree generally with respect to the withholding taxes —

No, his argument is that specifically ha

a necessary one to reach the contrary result.
MR. BARNETT:

I think it perhaps is.

Petitioner

says maybe this; person would be liable under the trust law,
but he was held liable here under the Internal Revenue Code.
QUESTION:

Under the trust law we are talking about

a successor. Now, directing your attention to the predecessor,
you can read the statute as requiring all three elements and
say the predecessor who has collected and accounted for has an
additional liability to pay.

QUESTION:

Hr. Barnett, you said a little while ago,

as I understood you, that the case had to be decided on the
language of the statutes and I think we would all agree with
that, and you said not on trust law.

Section 7501, as you

and others have suggested here, states that the amount of tax
collected is to be held in a special trust fund.

And one of

<15

the problems with vour case is that that trust fund was
dissipated, there was no
tion of this corporation»

res

left at the time of the acquisi­

I am not familiar with any trust

law that requires that where the trustee has dissipated the
funds of the trust someone who was not a party to that has to
restore them.

And I see no language in the Code that imposes

that obligation.
MR. EAENEfT%

Well, Mr. Justice Powell, for one thing

we don’t think we have to rely on 7501 since the language of
6672 is clear.

But in addition, it is not the case as

petitioner claimed that there is no law that supports the
notion that the trust still exists even though the money has
been dissipated.
The court below, in fact, dealt with a case, the
Teel case, which gives law on that point.

At page 56 of the

appendix, quoting from the Tee1 case, the Court of Appeals quoted:
"as che-cash went into the cash drawer, it became subject to
trust or lien in favor of the federal government for the unpaid
withholding taxes.

By dissipating the cash for new purchases,

of which the taxpayers knew, they unwittingly supplied the
necessary willfulness.”

We contend that that case, for one,

does support the notion that the trust still exists even though
the initial trustee has dissipated the actual dollars.
QUESTION:

The bankruptcy judge found here that no

Is there anything in the record bnat suggests

There was nothing as of the date of takeover that could be
identified as a

MR. BARNETT:

There is no requirement under

Section 7501 of segregation, that the employer segregate the
money being withheld.
QUESTION:

You would not construe the language

requiring that the funds be held in a special trust to require
segregation?
MR. BARNETT:

Apparently it has not been so construed,

I am informed.
QUESTION:

If I were a corporate officer, I would

certainly view it that way.
MR. BARNETT:

I would, too, as a corporate officer,

I take it there is no criminal statute

anywhere that imposes criminal sanctions for failure to
account for trust

funds, is there?

MR. BARNETT:

I don't know.

There is a criminal

statute that would be relevant here, Section 7202, the
criminal counterpart *—

But the Government did not proceed

under a criminal statute, of course.

Now, whether there is a

criminal statute that simply says anyone who violates any
trust imposed by the Internal Revenue Code is liable under that
code.

I don't know whether there is.

I tend to doubt it.

I

tend to think that petitioner's suggestion that the only way
the predecessor responsible officer in the Teel situation can
be reached is some vague trust law is something that the
Government —
QUESTION:.

Isn't there one that says it's a specific

MR. BARNETT:

That’s 7202, which is the criminal

conviction here, in which case there might be different
requirements of willfulness, I don’t know.

We are simply

proceeding under a civil statute.
QUESTION:

Mr. Barnett, just to make it clear, the

\

Government in a situation like this isn't helpless, I take it.
MR. BARNETT:

Well, I think it would be rather

helpless under petitioner's •—
QUESTION;

I know, but let's assume that the Government

knew what was happening and that the withholding taxes hadn’t

48

been paid and here comes a new man on the horizon.

A lien

had accured here, hadn't it?
MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

A lien had accrued.

I —

If it hadn't, the Government could easily

have perfected it.
MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

Yes, I think that's true.

With respect to any of the assets of the

corporation.
MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

I assume that 's true.
So it was in position to tell the company,

"As money comes in, you pay it over, because we have a lien on
it."

MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

Yes, but exercising its flexibility —

I know, but all T am saying is they ccvld

protect themselves.
MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

$177,000 they could if they wanted to.

MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

Well, they could protect themselves ---

Yes.

And they could take some risks, though.

They could say, "Well, we may get more if we let him go ahead."
Ar.d you say that is what they really did.
MR. BARNETT:

Yes, that's what they do in practice

or what they apparently did here, but they made no agreement
here, it is not asserted here that they made any agreement
that they would absolve the petitioner of the liability for

49
this if the petitioner kept the business going.
QUESTION:

Certainly, if they had a lien or could

have had it, they certainly didn’t assert it with respect to
certain monies,

They said,

"Go pay your bills, don’t give it

to us, although we have a lien on it.
And now you are saying,

Go pay somebody else."

"Well, that money they paid out, the

risk didn't turn out, we are going to collect it from the man
t

himself„"
MR. BARNETT:

That's right and that's what Congress

held in mind hare, because otherwise there would be —
QUESTION:

The question is whether that's what they

had in mind or not.
MR. BARNETT:

And the fact that the Government takes

a risk in a situation like this does not mean that 6672 liability
does net apply.
QUESTION:

Of course, in your view, the Government

really is* et taking a risk, because if the corporation succeeds,
it gets it from the corporation, and if the corporation fails,
it gets it from, the person in charge.
MR. BARNETT:

There is no reason to think that it

can ,ct it. fron the person in charge
QUESTION:

after all.

If the person in charge doesn't have it,

then it is; only to that extent —
MR. BARNETT:

Yes, and one might well assume that

the Government would have a better change to get it from those

50

first bills ::hat come into the corporation than from the
individual *
QUESTION:

Can't you concede that it shouldn't be

interpreted a failure to pay over if the Government says, "Oh,
go ahead and we are waiving our lien, pay it to somebody else"?
MR.BARNETT:

The Government did not.

It is not

claimed that the Government made any such express waiver here.
It would be a different case if it were claimed that the
Government had —
QUESTION:

They call up the Government on the

telephone,, the IRS, say, "Here is our situation."

And the

Government says, "We've got a lien on every dollar you get."
An.d then they talk for a while and the Government says, "Well,
we are probably going to get along better if we rock along,
we might get all of our money sconer or later."
MR. BARNETT:

That simply is not claimed to be the

fact hare, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

If i.t were, what would you say?

MR. BARNETT:

I think that would be an interesting

case in whether the Government can be equitablly estopped.
Thank you.

My time is up.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BENNET RLEINMAN
OH BEHALF OF PETITIONER

51
MR. KL3INMAN:

If the Court please, in terms of

analysis of the section, the individual petitioner or the
party being charged is charged with such tax.
the tax required to be collected by him.

Such tax is

As Mr. Justice

Stevens said, if it were not that tax, then the individual
could be held liable for corporeition income taxes and every
other tax along the board if such tax only meant any tax.
Such tax means any tax required to be collected by him.
If in fact what the Government says is true, it
doesn't make any difference when the tax accrued.

We are

talking about tax for a particular period, not just any old
withholding taxes.

If in fact what the Government says is

true that a man could today become a responsible officer,

.y

every dollar ha owed, leave the company, the next people did
not pay the withholding taxes, then he could be held responsible
under the Government's interpretation because one time he was
a responsible officer.

They said that all three of those things

did converge when he became the responsible officer.

But. that

doesn’t mean he is only responsible for the period of time when
they converge, but for the period of time before.
before, why net after?

Why if

And I suggest to you that this is not

what was intended.
The fact of the matter is that i n this case when
the Government knew that the tax was not paid, Dr. Slodov went
to them, paid the tax, because he was advised that funds were

52

available to pay.

So he decided that if the funds were avail­

able, he would pay.
QUESTION:

They were available because they had

withheld them from the employees .
MR. KLEINMAN:
QUESTION;

No, they were to be in the bank.

But after he came, on, he continued to

withhold ■—
MR. KLEINMAN:

I am not talking about that withholding.

When he bought the company, he knew that there wa.s a withholding
tax liability of the company, but he had been advised by the
seller of the stock to him that the money was in the bank,
all he had to do was go in and pay.

It was due tomorrow.

He would write the checks and pay the money.

He went in, the

money wasn't there.
Now, this is such a dangerous thing to anyone
purchasing stock, it would seem that whether he knew of the:
tax or not and whether he made an investigation, he could
have had his accountants in there for months and not known
tiiat the Government would come in at some later date and say
that these people whom you employ and who you contend are
independent contractors and therefore you. do not withhold are
in fact employees and you should have withheld.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kleinman, I think your opponent would

answer your before and after cases as well as this one by
emphasizing the word "willful" in the statute.
