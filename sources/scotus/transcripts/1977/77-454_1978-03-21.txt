PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Moorman Manufacturing Company against Bair.
Mr. Barnes, I think you may proceed when you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD K. BARNES ON
BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. BARNES:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This is an appeal from a decision of the Supreme

Court of Iowa upholding that State’s taxing scheme which has
the purpose and effect of imposing a tariff on imports while
subsidising exports.
The case differs from General Motors Corporation v.
District of Columbia, xdiich this Court decided in 1965, only
in irrelevant factual details and that the issue here is purely
constitutional whereas the Court was able to decide the
District of Columbia case on a statutory interpretation,
.ir

The appellant is the Moorman Manufacturing Company,
which is an Illinois-based corporation with the business of
manufacturing animal feeds which it sells to farmers and
others.

It has warehouses and salesmen in Iowa, but no

manufacturing in that State.

Everything sold into Iowa is

manufactured in Illinois„
The corporation paid the Iowa corporate income
tax, computing its apportionable income in the manner
prescribed in the Iowa statute, as to which there is no

4
dispute.

And then it apportioned that income following the

three-factor formula of the Uniform Diviaion of lncome for
Tax Purposes Act.

That is the formula of property, payro3.1,

and sales equally weighted, with the sales assigned to the
destination, in this case io*?a.
The assessments are for the difference between the
tax as thus apportioned and the Iowa formula.

The Iowa

formula provides for a single sales factor by destination, not
attributing anything to either property or payroll.

The Iowa

statute starts with Federal taxable income and makes certain
adjustments in it.

Then having done that, it applies a fraction,
%

the numerator of which is Iowa sales and the denominator sales
to customers all over, to that amount of total income.

And

this has the effect of attributing to Iowa all of the income
which is derived from the manufacture in Illinois and the sale
to customers in Iowa.

There is no tax on income from an Iowa

manufacturer selling .into Illinois.
All the facts are stipulated — the total taxable
income, the apportionment fractions, any one of the three
apportionment fractions, the amounts of tax which will be due
if the statute is held constitutional, and also the amount
of tax which will be due if it is held unconstitutional.

So

that the sole question in the case is the constitutionality
of a single sales fraction.
The appellee agrees with that.

That appears in his

5
motion to dismiss and also in his brief.
QUESTION:

Mr. Barnes, just one question there.

If the statute is unconstitutional, why do you owe any tax?
MR. BARNES:

We don't owe any tax more than we

already paid.
QUESTION:

Why did you have to pay any at all?

MR. BARNES:

Because we — Oh, Mr. Justice Stevens,

the statute imposing tax is not unconstitutional.

The only

thing that is unconstitutional is the apportionment formula,
so-called apportionment formula.
QUESTION:

You say that the constitution mandates

the three partite formula that you used in filling out your
returns?
MR. BARNES:

No, Mr. Justice Stevens.

We don't

call on the Court to impose a formula or perform any other
legislative function.

We merely say that the single sales

factor is unconstitutional, and that's all that the Court is
asked to do.
QUESTION:

And if that's correct, then, as my brother

Stevens has indicated, you would owe no tax under the Iowa
statute, and yet you voluntarily paid a tax, didn't you?
MR. BARNES:
Sfcewarfc.

I wouldn't go that far, Mr. Justice

1 think the statute is perfectly valid except for

this apportionment formula.

And the statute not only says

— I shouldn't say apportionment.

Thera is no apportionment.

6

This single faetor sales formula of attribution, I think, is
unconstitutional, but the statute also says that in the case
of interstate commerce, the taxpayer shall pay a reasonable
portion.

So I think that knocking out the formula does not

knock out the statute nor the liability.
,

It just leaves a

question as to hov; it will be computed.
QUESTION:

How can it be?

Has the taxing agency

any authority to set up a different formula?
MR. BARNES:
QUESTION:

Yes, they do.
They do.

MR. BARNES:
QUESTION:

Yes, they do.

In this statute —

And you suggest they could then compute

the tax on some three-factor or other formula?
MR. BARNES:

That is what we have agreed on.

But

almost all these statutes in all States contain a provision
that if there is something wrong with a statutory formula, the
commission or the director can work out something that fits in
a particular case.

A prima example was the one in California

in the McDonnell Douglas case.

The California statute provided

that the property factor is going to consider only owned
property.

McDonnell Douglas

owned a big factory in California
/

and they leased a big factory in another State.

And they said

it's not fair to attribute all of our property to California
when we are using this property in another State.
California Supreme Court agreed.

And the

This was a case in which the

7
statute was improper in its application in a particular case.
So the statutes permit that all along, including
the lov/a statute.
QUESTION:

You had to pay the tax based on a three-

factor fomula.
MR. BARNES:
additional assessment.

That is right.

We did not pay on the

We filed an appeal bond instead.

All the other States, including Illinois — not all,
but all the ones that are important, including Illinois —
use the three-factor formula: the property, payroll, and sales.
QUESTION:
pertinent.

You said all the States that are

You mean the ones in which your client is subject

to taxation.
MR. BARNES:

1 made that qualification because there

are one or two States that, while using three-factor formula,
apply some different weights.

And there is one State which

has adopted the only really sound formula, which is property
and payroll but no sales in it.
QUESTION:

That's West Virginia.

Are you saying that because so many

other States have adopted the three-factor formula, Iowa is
under constitutional mandate to do the same thing?
MR. BARNES:

No.

What we say is that they are

under a constitutional mandata not to adopt something different
which imposes a double tax on interstate commerce.
QUESTION:

But supposing every State in the Union

8
had adopted l'owa ‘ s formula.

Could you make the same argument

that you are making now, that Iowa's formula is unconstitutional?
MR. BARNES:

Yes, because the taxes would be being

.*

paid all to the v?rong States, which is a due process problem.
QUESTION:

How can you know what the wrong States

are?
i;

MR. BARNES:
in that case.

There wouldn't ba any double taxation

But you would still have taxes going to places

that are unrelated to where the income was earned and to where
the governmental services were rendered.
QUESTION:

But certainly there would be some nexus

between the taxes collected and the earning of income.
MR. BARNES:
!'

No, there is no nexus question in this

'

case.

We agree with the nexus.

It could have a very tiny

nexus and the same problems would arise.
whether a tax is owed, but how much.

The question is not

And the measure is

entirely our problem.
QUESTION;

You have got to show that Iowa's proposed

measure is unconstitutional, not just that you don't like it
or that you would have done something else if you were a
legislator;
MR. BARNES:

That's right.

I think we have no

difficulty with that.
The hypothetical which this Court used in its
opinion in the General Motors v. District of Columbia case

9
is applicable here.

Assume that a particular manufacturer

does all its manufacturing in Illinois and it sells only to
i

customers in Iowa.
*

QUESTION:

Mr. Barnes, you argued the General Motors

lease, didn't you?
MR. BARNES:
QUESTION:
MR. BARNES:
QUESTION:

I did, sir.
Two of thorn?

Or not?

You remember, Mr. Justice White.
I should, yes.

Washington and District

of Columbia.
i

MR. BARNES:

Correct.

And I tried again but you wouldn't take it.
QUESTION;
MR. BARNES:
QUESTION:

I think you won the Washington.
I lost Washington and won the D.C.
Oh, yes, that's right.

t

MR. BARNES:

In that situation, all manufacture

(S(ic)
in Iowa and all customers in the District of Columbia —in Iowa,
%
Illinois would tax two-thirds of the income by applying its
property and payroll factors.

It wouldn't apply the sales

factor because -the sales were all outside the State.

And Iowa

would tax 100 percent of the income because it attributes all

j
incoma to a locus of the customer.

That's a total of 166 percent..

As I say, that hypothetical I have taken from GMC v. District of
Columbia.

This shows the fallacy of the argument.

They are

making the same error that the court of appeals made in the

10
GMC cane, namely, that because the unrelated .income is not
taxed, income is apportioned.

The fact is that 100 percent of

related income is taxed.
Now, they say, for instance, Moorman has a factory
in Texas that sells to Texas customers.

By not taxing any of

that, they say, well, Moorman's entire income is apportioned.
But apportionment of the entire income is irrelevant.

What
*

counts is the income on the segment of the business that consists
of manufacturing in Illinois and selling to customers in Iowa.
The sales fraction, of course, does not do any
apportioning.

It merely identifies the income from that seg­

ment of the business.

Taken by itself, the tax is 100 percent

of that income.
Now, the sales factor is economically illegitimate
in any case, but it is tolerable if combined with property
and payroll factors which do measure the income-producing
t

activity and which also measures the burden on governmental
services.

^
QUESTION s

This again is a constitutional argument,

I take it, not just an economic argument.
t

MR. BARNES:

Yes, because, as we have attempted to

point out, the constitutionality of things in this area have
to take into consideration economic realities, among other
considerations.

The constitutional requirements rest to a

considerable degree on economies.

13
QUESTION:

Your basic constitutional claim, as I

r

understand it, Mr. Barnes, is that what Iowa has done results
in double taxation of interstate commerce.
MR. BARNES:
argument.

That is the interstate commereo

There is also the due process point because they

are reaching outside their geographical borders to grab
something from another State.
QUESTION:

Precisely how does thi3 double taxation,

as you refer to it, take place?

How do you define double

taxation?
MR. BARNES:

That was the hypothetical 1 went

through a minute ago.
t

QUESTION:
MR. BARNES:

Multipla taxation perhaps is better.
Illinois uses this three-factor

formula which is universal except for.Iowa.

And if we

manufacture in Illinois, Illinois will attribute to itself
two-thirds of the income derived from that part of the business,
because it will apply property factor and payroll factor.
Iowa, then, if the shipment is into Iowa, attributes
100 percent of the income to itself because it attributes
all of it to the location of the customer.
QUESTION:

So yon say that if the same income is

attributed to more than one State, it's double taxation.
t

MR. BARNSS:
QUESTION:

Yes, and constitutionally impermissible.
what case supports that?

12
MR» BARNES:

There a:;e many cases that touch on

tills particular subject, most of them not in this precise
context.

Of course, the best description of the situation is

General Motors v. District of Columbia.

The only trouble with

that is that the Court was able to decide it on a statutory
ground, which cannot be done in this case.
Freeman v. Hewit is a case in which a different
type of tax was struck down because of the mere danger of a
.t

double taxation by a second State.
QUESTION:

You think Freeman v. Hewit is still good

law after our recent decisions in the last two or three years?
MR. BARNES:

Yes.

I don't know of any decision

that attacks the conclusion in that one.

That was outshipmanfcs.

Now, the recent decisions that have upheld the tax on somewhat
that same type have bean on inshipments.
isn't the only case, of course.

Freeman v, Hewit.

Adams y. Sfcoren is another on©.

Gwin, White & Prince v, H©nna£ord is still another.

And there

are a great many.
QUESTION:

Supposing you had a neighboring State

next to Iowa that had a two-factor formula «— payroll and
property — and Iowa had the ons^factor formula — sales.
Would both statutes be unconstitutional?

And say all the

goods ar© manufactured in -the two-factor formula State end
shipped into the one-factor formula State.
statutes be unconstitutional?

Would both

13
MR. BARNES:
QUESTION:
MR. BARNES:

No.

What you would get in that case —

You would have 200 percent tax.
One hundred percent duplication, 200

percent instead of 166 that we have here.
The rule has long been that what on© State does
doesn't make much difference to what another State does.
QUESTION: Then they would both be bad.
MR. BARNES:
are both good.

Well, the conclusion usually Is they

But you pose an extreme case and there is

something in that case to uphold the neighboring State's twofactor formula.

West Virginia, they don't neighbor on Iowa,

but they ship things up there.

The fiscal soundness, economic

soundness, of the property and payroll factors would throw a
terrific burden on the State of Iowa to justify its own sales
factor, and it can't meet that burden.

Furthermore, fch© two

factors, while differing from the three factors used by the
majority of States, is very close to what is done by a majority
of States„

It attributes income to the sources of capital

and labor, which this Court has often said are the sources
of income.
QUESTION:

But, Mr. Barnes, what I am asking you,

does your argument rest on fch® overlap, which it would seem to
me makes all statutas unconstitutional, or are you arguing
quite a different argument that fcha sales factor just isn't
justifiabl© because there is not enough activity in the State?

14

If you are arguing overlap, I don't see what
difference it wakes which factor you use.

Any one would be

unconstitutional if it is not the same as the neighboring State's.
MR. BARNESj

The difference is that — I don’t

think both statutes would be unconstitutional in your case.
I think the sales tax would be unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

But doesn't your overlap argument apply

equally to both States?
MR. BARNES;

It does, and it puts a burden on both

States to prove the validity of its method of doing it.

I

think the State that uses property and payroll can easily
prove it and the State that uses sales can't corns anywhere
near proving it.
QUESTION;

But are you then saying that if ©very

State in the country used a purely sales method, every
State statute would be unconstitutional?

And then you don’t

have to rely on overlap at all.
MR. BARNES:
the double taxation•

That's right.

That would eliminate

I think Mr, Justice Relinquish asked me

a question similar to that.

But what it would do would b© to

result *ia the taxes being paid to the wrong. States, because
there isn't any basis for attributing taxes on an income to
idle locus of the customers, which is what that would do.
.QUESTIONs
i"

See, you have got two quite different

•

theories«

I am trying to understand on which one You ars

15
resting.

One is an overlap double taxation theory.

The other

is that sales isn't any good no matter how it's done.
MR. BARNES;
QUESTION;

Right.
Which is your principal argument?

MR. BARNES:

On the interstate commerce phase of the

case, tha overlap.
QUESTION;
issue, I take it.

But you roly equally on your due process

That's the sales factor just taxes income

earned in another State.
MR. BARNES:

That's right.

We have said ©rough about fcfa© sales tax — sales
fraction, not apportioning.

A tax is justified only by

governmental services? v in the case of corporations services
to corporations.

And the sales factor is unrelated to services.

It doesn't in any way measure the burden which the corporation
imposes upon the State.

Income, as this Court has often said,

is the product of capital or labor or both.
'factor is unrelated to that.

And the sales

Selling effort, of course,

'produces income, but that is measured by capital and labor.
The Iowa formula has no relation to selling effort.

It has

.no relation to the warehouses and inventories, nor to the
'salesmen employees that are in the Stato of Iowa„

The tax

would be the same if there were no property or payroll in
Iowa.

It would also ha the same if Moorman were to pick up

its entire Illinois factory and put it in Iowa.

It would not

16
increase the tax in the slightest.
The effect of the formula is to tax capital and
labor which is in Illinois , and again impose a tariff on imports
and subsidise the exports, and in conjunction with Illinois
to cause a double tax.
In a powerful brief of 15 distinguished economists,
that economic fallacy in the sales factor is pointed out to
tariff on imports, an inducement to trade war with resulting
injury to common markets.

Now, since our last brief was

written, our attention has been drawn to an activity in the
State of Minnesota which shows that th© trad© war which was
theoretically envisioned by the economists is actually going on.
Minnesota had permitted manufacturers such as
Moorman shipping into Minnesota to use the standard three-factor
formula, equally weighted, property, payroll, and sales.
Now they have a bill pending which would force Moorman and
other similarly situated to us© a three-factor formula but
only 15 percent property, 15 pereant payroll, and 70 percent
sales.

The report that I get is that this is done in

retaliation for Wisconsin’s recent changing the weights in
its formula and increasing th© weight on sales from on©-third
tap to one-half.

QUESTION:

How much latitude do you think the

Constitution allows the various States in using one- , two- , or
three- formulas and in weighting the formulas?

17
MR. BARNES:

I think that the decisions of this

Court and of other courts have upheld minor

overlap,
j

*

particularly where the overlap is not directly intentional,
it just happens to

result from a different way of doing tilings.

That can happen under the three-factor formula equally weighted
because of different definitions of some parts of the formula.
But it doesn’t produco any very serious overlap.
In this case wo have a serious overlap that ±3 141
percent in one of the years, and there is nothing just
incidental about it»

It's intention, it's the deliberate

intention to impose a tariff on imports and subsidise exports.
Referring to that Minnesota thing again, a very
peculiar provision in that statute, or bill since it's a
pending bill, as it has bean reported to us orally, we haven't
seen it, is that it contains a provision that will not take
effect if Moorman succeeds in this case,
QUESTION:

Tell ms specifically what impact does

this sales factor have with respect to the competition between.
Iowans and people from Illinois?
MR. BARNES:
which w© can measure.

Th© effect on competition is nothing
At this point all we can do is look at

it —
QUESTION:

You say it's a tax on imports.

It's a

tax on imports because you are saying both Illinois and Iowa
are taxing th© same income.

So the tax bite on Moorman is

10

higher —
MR. BARNES!

Evan if Illinois were not taxing the

same income? as a matter of fact, the first two years in this
appeal they didn't.

Their corporate income tax came in later.

It still is a tax on imports because it is attributing to Iowa
100 percent of —
QUESTION:

But does it help lowans control the Iowa

market?
MR. BARNES:

That results if there is another tax,

as there is in this case.

Because Moorman has to pay tax on

166 percent of its income, and Iowa —
QUESTION:

And makes it loss able to compete in the

Iowa market.
MR. BARNESs

That's right.

And an Iowa manufacturer

wouldn't pay that.
Th© biggest boon is to the Iowa manufacturer who
sells into Illinois or some other place, because ha doesn't
pay any tax to Iowa at all, and is taxed on only one-third
of his income when it gets into Illinois because of the
application of the sales factor in that case.
Now, when many States do it one way and Iowa does
it another —
QUESTION s

You think there is a discrimination

then against interstate commerce or not?
MR, BARNESs Yes, there is.

19
QUESTION:

Well, is that an independent basis for

invalidating it?
MR. BARNES:

No.

It isn't independent of the

overlap.
QUESTION:
MR. BARNESj

You think it's the same,
Yes.

The overlap i3 what illustrates

and this was the consequence of the discrimination against
interstate commerce.
As I said, when Iowa does it one way and all the
other States do it some other way, Iowa has to give way unless
Iowa can clearly establish that it’s right and ‘the others are
clearly wrong.
QUESTION:
right to tax, or

In other words, Iowa's constitutional
limitations on Iota's power to tax

is affected by the means chosen by other States.
MR. BARNES:

That is true.

And Iowa, since it8s so

different from everybody else, has the burden of proof showing
that It's right.
QUESTION:L

I thought that every State enactment

was presumed constitutional.
MR. BARNES:
QUESTION:

So?
So why does Iowa have the burden ©f

1 proof?
MR. BARNES:

I merely cite the decisions of this

Court, the most recent one very recently, the Raymond Transport

20
Company v. Wisconsin, in v;h:ioh the
\

unconstitutional,

Wisconsin statute was held

or regulation, because it was different

from the regulations of other States thereby imposing a burden
on,,in that case,the trucking industry.

And before that there

have been others like Bibb v. Navajo» another one of the
same type of thing.
It's a perfectly valid statute if it stood by
itself, but invalid only because it was incompatible with
other States and imposed an unreasonable burden on the
interstate commarce involved in those cases.
QUESTION:

Do you think if neither party had

introduced evidence in the recent Wisconsin case, the Wisconsin
statute would have been struck down because Wisconsin had the
burden of proof to show it was constitutional?
MR. BARNES:
to show too things:

No.

The case had to have evidence

One was what other States were doing,

and the second one was that the interplay of Wisconsin and
the other States imposed a burden on interstate commerce,
and that evidence was in the case,
QUESTION:
the tax rates were?

Mr. Barnes, does the record tell us what
How heavy a tax is it?

MR. BARNESs

In early years it was 3 percent and in

the latter years 10 percent.

MR. BARNESi

Ten percent.

QUESTION*

Do you think it would be unconstitutional

to impose a 10 percent sale * tax?
MR. BARNES:

No.

They could do that.

The appellee hasn't madi any case of their own.
They have argued that 100 percent income is not taxed.
wrong.

The statute defines the income.

That's

In tlteir brief they

say that the State taxed 100 porcent income of the local
businesses, which it did, but it also taxed 100 percent —
QUESTION:

You would be making the same argument,

I take it, if this tax rata were one-half of one percent, or
one one-hundredths of one percent.
1HR. BARNES*

You asked me about that one once before.

The answer here is that in -tills particular case the total tax
if they were

to tax on gross receipts, which would be a low

rat© of tax, would be substantially less than the tax that is
involved in this case.
We applied th© Washington statute to these fast©
and it came out way down.
QUESTIONs

Yes, but why shouldn't a reasonable

question b© whether or not a State is extracting from Moorman
a reasonable return for what it doss for Moorman?
MR. BARNES:

There isn't any measure.

Th© sales

formula doesn't measure anything that the State doss for
:Moorman., nor any placa that Moorman earns the income.

22

QUESTION:
percent rate.

Suppose it were one-thousandth of one

You wouldn51 say that it was more than what

Iowa was doing for Moorman?
MR. BARNESs

Well, if the tax were very low, we

wouldn’t be quarreling about it, but the legal principle, the
constitutional principle, would be just the same, assuming —
QUESTION:

Unless you say the constitutional principle

is that interstate commerce and Moorman have to pay their way,
and unless somebody can show the State is extracting too much
for what it5s giving, the tax is constitutional.
MR. BARNES:

You would have an interstate commerce

objection if they taxed their own corporations on the same
basis and then exempt them from the tax, as the sales factor
does, and than applied it to Moorman.
Now, of course, if the amount is very small, nobody
is going to complain.

That’& why gross receipts taxes were

allowed for -QUESTION:

Of course, th© Iowa people who are

exporting, manufacturing and exporting, are paying property
taxas and everything aIs© in Iowa.

The total tax burden

imposed by Iowa may be greater than Moorman's, for all you know.
MR. BARNES:

But Moorman is paying the same taxes

in Illinois, so there isn’t any —
QUESTION:

What if Iowa’s tax rate was 1 percent

and it had a single factor formula and Illinois’s tax rate

23
were IS percent, but it had a three-factor formula?

Would

your answer as to constitutionality of Iowa9 e statute still to
the same?
MR. BARNES?

Ye®, sir.

Ho difference.

The rata

and the bass are unaffected in an argument of apportionment,
which is all wo ar® arguing about her®.
Eh© present situation, then, is vra have a double
tax which is a violation of the Commerce Clause; we have &
tax on manufacturing that is out of the State, which violates

QUESTION:

What do you mean by "facial constitu­

tionality"?
MR. GRIGEF.s

I believe that facial constitutionality

moans that it must bo constitutional under all — rather, it
must be unconstitutional under all conceivable circumstances.
If it

simply has a possibility of being unconstitutional some

of the tiros or under some conceivable circumstances, I believe
that should be an as-applied issue.
QUESTIONs

That's really overbreadth you ar©

talking about, isn't it?
MR. GRIGERs Yes, I believe the whole case is over­
breadth „
QUESTIONs

That’s only been applied in the First

Amendment ©r©a, hasn’t it?

Why do you need to wrestle with

facial constitutionality at all when you are talking about a
tax statute that has nothing to do with free speech?
MR. GRIGERs

Maybe I am being misunderstood.

When this case began Moorman basically put into
issue that the Iowa sales tax is invalid, period, under any
conceivable circumstances.
QUESTION %
MR. GRIGERs

You didn’t have to buy that, did you?
No.

We don’t.

And our trial judge

in Iowa held that it was unconstitutional under all conceivable
circumstances.

The Iowa Supreme Court, which we believe

correctly mat the issue, said, no, there is no showing it

25
can be facially unconstitutional bacause it*3 not facially
unconstitutional under all circumstances.

And, secondly, as

to this particular tax there has been no proof of unconstitu­
tionality .
But what I am saying is as far as the facial due
process issue, this would mean that no matter what the
circumstances, the Iowa single sales factor formula would
automatically causa extraterritorial taxation, Mr. Justice
Stehnquist, regardless of the circumstances.
what Moorman is saying.

I believe that is

That is not our position.

We don’t

think they have proved that in any event.
The Iowa single sales factor formula, exploring this
one step further, applies not simply to corporations such as
'Moorman, which manufacture outside the State of Iowa and sell
within, it applies to retail merchants, wholesale merchants,
in-St&t® manufacturers, out-of-State manufacturers, manufacturers
'manufacturing in State rand out of State.
Moorman’s evidence, of course, was only directed
t: .
"towards its own facts, which it agrees on page 4 of its brief
that that is all the issues really are.

This, as I say,

suggests that this case really involves the constitutionality
■of the Iowa formula as applied to Moorman’s facts, and it is
too broad to say that it involves an attach upon the statute
as invalid under any conceivable circumstances which are not
even before the Court today.

26
Du-3 Process principias derived from constitutional
apportionsmt cases dacidacl by this Court ire as follows?
First, the statutory formula and the results reached
in its application are presumed constitutional.

An attack

here must show unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt,
rebut all reasonable basis to support the formula.
Second, t±ie States have great leeway in their choice
and application of formula.
Third, th© Court has never stricken an apportionment
formula on its face.

In the hundred and some odd years of

constitutional history of formulas in this country,
'i

on®

has

•

never been stricken on its face.

They have adopted a sase-by-

"ease approach, carefully reviewing th© record in the courts
below to see if the taxpayer showed constitutional transgression»
.A taxpayer has in this area not merely the burden of proof,

■)mt

extremely heavy burden of proof in challenging a formula's

constitutionality.

This generally requires a powerful

evidentiary showing against th© formula and not merely, as in
‘■'■febi® case, arguments of counsel.

And, of course, precise

'!'"to this case for the years in question, th© Iowa apportionment

27
formula,as applied to the Iowa computed not income tax base,
showed that Moorman earned from about 21.9 or 22 percent of
its income in Iowa to about 18.7 percent for the five years
in question.

This is stipulated, and there is really no

dispute as to the fact the formula shows that.
We believe that Moorman was required to show, to
satisfy its burden of proof

that the Iowa law was unconstitu­

tional , that they didn't earn that amount, that they earned
a substantially lessar amount.
Now, the only evidence in this case in the stipu­
lated data, there ware no witnesses, we have stipulated data
in this case, consisted of a more comparison of the results
reached by Moorman's three-factor formula, which is about 12.2
to 14.5 percent of its incoma in Iowa, and, of course, the
Iowa formula listing the percentages that I mentioned.

In

other words, we have a comparison of one estimate with another
estimate, with no evidence in th© case which estimate may be
right or which estimate may b® wrong.

Prom all that appears

in tills ease, we have actually undertaxed Moorman.
QUESTIONt

It is true, isn't it, General, that your

single formula does benefit your Iowa manufacturers?

And

this, I take it, is why we have an amicus brief from

Dear© & Co.

and Maytag and others who ship out of the State.
MR. GRIGERs

QUESTION:

MR. GRIGER:

and in Illinois, sir.
QUESTION:

And this is why they are in favor of the

single sales formula.
In other words, how do you answer Mr. Barnes8
argument that you ar© not favoring the exporters at the cost
of the importers# if there is an answer?
MR. GRIGER:

First of all# the only answer I can

think of giving a particular question like that is that you
ar® talking about a theory.
QUESTION:

It is a legitimate question.

MR. GRIGER:
it isn’t.

I’m not saying it isn’t.

There# of course, the formula

would tax the total segment income if you accept the theory

29
of a company manufacturing in a Stato, whereas theoretically
in the formula — it doesn't taka into account what is going
on in the State of sales.
Now, Mr. Barnes is saying the same thing insofar as
this case.

I believe, ho waver, that the Iowa tax is triggered

and is applicable against corporations who sell in the Iowa
market place.

And if they do that, they become subject to the

Iowa corporate income tax.
QUESTIONs

Of course, Icm not suggesting Mr. Barnes

Let me put it like this, if I may rely on a

prior case, the Hans Rees

case, in which a taxpayer came in

and actually was able to break down the components of his
profit and show the formula, a single property formula in that
case, just wasn’t any good.

It overreached.

Now, if Moorman can make the same showing, fin®.
We would like this case to simply be treated as the Court has
been treating apportionment cases for a numbar of years, on a
:case-by-sas® basis.

In other words, there is a case,., for

it had put soma accountants on the stand and proved by cost
accounting that part of its net profit is attributable to its
manufacturing operations in Illinois?

That was Hans Reas,,

wasn't it?
MR. GRIGSR:

Yes, Hans Roes did involvo, I believe,

cost accounting where the evidence was not rebutted by the
State. As a lawyer and not being an accountant or an economist,
I would have to talk to ray own witnesses, and wo may very
well generate some type of,

well, a jury question, for

lack of a batter description of it, although it would be
decided in our case by a judge, as to .whether or not they

But, yes, if we w©r© dealing with a Hans Reas
situation here, we would be dealing with a far different
situation than what we are dealing with now.

No, sir.

We believe that the cornerstone of Moorman’s

argument and whole case, whether they talk about Due Process,

34
Equal Protectio», Interstat® Commerce, rests upon the abstract
argument of counsel that Iowa necessarily taxed 100 porcent
of Moorman's income from Iowa sales of goods manufactured in
Illinois.
We disagree that Moorman showed that Iowa so taxed
100 percent of such income and implicated feho facial validity
of the Iowa formula.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY M. GRIGER ON
BEHALF OF APPELLEE
MR* GRIGER*
the Court:

(RESUMED)

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

Before the recces I was getting into Moorman's

contention that 100 percent of their income was necessarily
taxed by Iowa* that is, income that they derive from selling
goods in Iowa, which goods wore manufactured in Illinois.
One of the points I would like to m&ka in this
regard is there is a total lack of evidence in tills record
as to whether or not there is any manufacturing profit in
Illinois.

Such lack of evidence -ssas held to foe a fatal defect

by this Court in the Bass case, the Underwood

case, Kenfc-°Co££®y

cases, all involving single property factor formulas.
QUESTION:

Could I just pursue that again.

an exchange about this before.

We had

If there had been cost

accounting evidence that part of the profit was assignable to
Illinois manufacturing, and assume it was uncontradictad,
what would you say then?

Could you still us© the sales tax

formula?
MR. GRIGER:

On© of the things I would want to know

is how much, because in this sense the States are allowed

36
a rough approxr: •■'.tion.

If they had manufacturing profit, for

example, that we waro trying to tax out of all reasonable
proportion to business dona -QUESTION;

Suppose it’s a third, third, and third.

That9s what the accountants testified to.

And on any

reasonable accounting basis, a third of the income is assignable
to Illinois manufacturing.

And then Iowa said, well, we

are still going to use the single sales formula.

What would

you say then?
MR. GRIGERs

Of sours®, if they could prove it, I

think we are getting into a Hans Reas type situation;

that is,

breaking down the component parts*of the business to show —
QUESTION s

Are you suggesting that you agree that

\\

constitutionally Iowa may not tax income that could be shown
to be traceable to Illinois manufacturing?
MR. GRIG'S E:

I think this is what extraterritorial

taxation is all about, is trying to overreach beyond the
State.

The States have been granted some leeway in this

area.
QUESTION?

General Griger, what do you understand

Justice White*8 phrase "traceable to Illinois manufacturing"
to mean when you answer his question?
MR. GRIGERs

As I understand, there may not be able

■ to be a precise», apportionment to Illinois, but it may b® a
situation like Hans Rees where the evidence differed, and I

37
think it was between 17 and 21 percent earned in the State
of North Carolina in that case, whereas the formula attributed
30~8cme percent to North Carolina.
QUESTIONS

You wouldn't say evidence like that would

be irrelevant or inadmissible, would you?
MR. GRIGER:
QUESTION:

No» I believe this Court —
And if the judge cor'eluded,, made findings

that based on the evidence before me, one-third of the income
is due to manufacturing in Illinois.

If tfes-r© is a finding

like that, would you say that ■=*- you wouldn't conclude —
would you argue that Iowa could nevertheless tax that part of
the income?
MR. GRIGER:

If a finding could be mad©.

I'm not

an accountant or an economist, and I might want to consult my
own expert witnesses.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

MR. GRIGER:

I -think what you ar© saying is basically

If/r" •

the Hans Rees situation.
V ;■

.

would be

Yes, th® Court has alraady held that

—
QUESTION:

What would you understand such a finding

by a trial judge that one-third of the income is, quote, due to,
close quote, manufacturing in Illinois to mean economically?
MR. GRIGER:

Well, if we can break the business down

into its components that he would actually be malting a finding
in that instance that the income can b© directly traceable to

38
that activity.

2Tow, generally this cannot be dons in the

unitary business.

From CPA's I've talked to in our Department

of Revenue in Iowa, they say it can't be done.
QUESTION:

Take, for instance, when you are talking

about tlia production of copper wire, you have copper that may
have been mined in Arizona and Utah, smelted in El Paso,
refined somewhere els©

and nad© into wire still somewhere

else, it would be kind of hard to ascribo a, quote, due to,
close quote, finding to any one of those activities, wouldn't it?
ME. GRXGERs

As I understand it, it would ba.

think we were assuming hypothetically it could b© don®.
don't know that it can bo done.

I
I

But if it could ba, then I

think we have a burden of going forward with our own evidence.
Maybe we can attack that finding, show that it is based on
faulty promises.
As I understood his question, if it could'be shown,
then would we be overreaching by tailing all that income?

I

suppose the answer would be yes, because the answer was yes
in the Hans Reas case.

That's at least what I meant my answer

to be.
I believe that this Court has also held and
correctly so, in Ford Motor Company v. Beauchamp, that
constitutionality ©f -State taxation ought not to turn upon so
narrow an. issue as to whether local assets rather than local
'gross receipts are used in an apportionment formula.

The

39

presumption of constitutionality mist: in thie type of a case,
an apportionment oa^-c, rau&t be overcome by evidence and not by
the argument of control to satisfy tbs heavy burden of proof.
I would like to get or. now into the argument in
this case involving interstate comperes.

Nov» again» as far

a® the leva statute is concerned- the basic argument of
' Moorman» which is that the Iowa fomuls is bad per se» means
that it must necessarily» regardless of the facts# cause
multiple taxation to be visited upon Moorman or anybody els©
for that matter.

Wo believe that th© sum and substance

of Moorman's argument in this regard is that anybody that deviates
from the three factor formula

autoptically creates multiple

taxation or risk of multiple taxation.
We think Moorman's argument is somewhat inconsistent»
that in its brief, page 2§# it says if. accepts the single
property factor formula which# of course# is such a deviation.
Th© argument also wa think assumes that you have
' ah easily definable tax base# such as what you would h&wa in
the gross receipts area where everybody can see the gross
receipts*

Jhad that is what you are apportioning,

That isn't true.
Vhet income*

What is being apportioned hare is

States like Iowa offer what might fee called

somewhat of a low tax baa© .

We do allow large deductions#

’ 'including a Federal incerne tass deduction *

I don't believe

■' that'B allowed by the State of Illinois,, for example.' It's

40
only allowed by about six States.
If we accept Moorman1 s counsel's argument in this
case, we believe that any formula other than a uniform threefactor formula, and also a uniform tax fc&so, would impale —

i

I should rephrase that.

If Moorman's argument were accepted,

any formula that would deviate somehow from a uniform formula
"or tar base that would be differant would somehow create the
risk of multiplo taxation, destroying the leeway States have
in this area, a leeway, I might add, it seems to me this Court
has recognised, at least in the area of nonbusiness income
and disparate use of combination corporate tax reporting
recently in the U-S» Steel Corporation v. Multi-State Tax
Commission case decided on February 21.

While that case did

involve the Compact Clause of the Constitution, I believe
there were arguments made as to interstate commerce, and the
Court recognised that States did. do things differently, but
held that that wasn51 necessarily bad..
Of course, only Congress would have the power in
any ©vent to act affirmatively under the Commerce Claus© and
to,if they wanted to, impose upon all the States a uniform
apportionment formula or ©van a uniform tax bass.

But that

has not been done yefc, and the States have and ought to have
some leeway in this area in support of their fundamental power
of taxation.
in fact

It's fcho must fundamental power a State can have,

41
I would aleo like to make a few comments about
General Hotoirs v. District of: Columbia.

2 think tbs parties

here agree that that case did not reach the constitutional
issues that are being raised, here*

In addition,, there was no

exclusive formula in that case approved by the Court.

The

Court read th© District statute which, of course, prescribed
no formula, as requiring on© which automatically would give
effect to th© geographical spread of all components
manufacturing business,

of a

There was no overruling of prior

constitutional case precedents, particularly the single factor
casas

and the Ford Motor case involving the very formula

that we have here today.
'

4'

The case doss not implicate a taxpayer8® heavy

burden of proof -that a statutory formula is unconstitutional.
And we believe that based upon 'this Court's reading of the
District statute in that case that a single property factor

probably would have been inconsistent with the statute insofar
as applying it to an integrated manufacturing-selling business,
manufacturing in on© State and selling goods in th© District
of Columbia.
We believe that the Court's standards on multiple
taxation should ba derived from th© case© of worttofesfc Pcrtland
Cement ease and also its recent case, 1975, the Standard Pregs.
'Steel case, in which the Court seems to be going to an actual
burden.

And it certainly isn't a mem risk on the basis of

42
argument of counsel.

That is an abstract notion of a risk

that there is necessarily a discrimination against out-ofSt© ta manufacturers.

that is, a company manufacturing totally out of Iowa and then
