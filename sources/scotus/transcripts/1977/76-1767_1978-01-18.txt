MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 76-T767> National Society of Professional Engineers
against United States.
Mr. Loevinger.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEE LOEVINGER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LOEVINGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The National Society of Professional Engineers,
the Petitioner here, appears .in a most extraordinary position.
It is opposing the Government and advocating the public inter­
est by arguing for an ethical principle which protects the
public against injury and clients against cheating.

The

Government, on the other hand, takes the position that these
matters are not matters for consideration by the Court because
it invokes the rubric of per se.

Indeed, as I read the

Government's brief, the terra "public interest" doesn't appear
in it once.
The principle that we sustain declares the solicita­
tion of engineering work by competitive bidding before consul­
tation with a client or determination of the scope of the ’work
to be contrary to the public interest, and therefore unethical.
The alternative method of solicitation of work by
bidding is the traditional ethical method which involves an

4
initial selection of an engineer by qualificatlon.»with fees
proposed after consultation with the client and after determin*ation of the scope of the work.

It is basic to understand that

engineering involves solving practical problems by the appli­
cation of science — there is a great deal of testimony on this
subject — so that each engineering problem is essentially
unique and, indeed, each engineering solution is really a new
scientific invention.
To determine the nature and the scope of engineering
problems and their solution requires substantial consultation
and negotiation between engineer and client.

The fee is then

calculated and the client is perfectly free to accept or reject
any fee that is calculated and to engage the engineer or not
engage the engineer and go on and negotiate with other engineers
if he likes.
CUafcJTlWN:

Is there a law preventing him from asking

two engineers to embark on this process at the same time?
MR. LUjiT/INGER:

It is impractical, Mr. Chief Justice.

It has been found that it doesn't work.

It's like trying to

conduct a private discussion with two people.

I don't know

that there is any specific statement on the subject.

There

is explicit testimony that there is nothing to prevent a client
from negotiating with as many engineers as he likes, even on the
same day.
QUESTION:

But if he doesn't like the first engineer's

estimate, he certainly -- you've already said —
MR, LOEVINGER:

He Is free to negotiate with a second,
,

i

a third, a fourth, a fifth, as many as his patience will sus­
tain.

There is no question about that.
QUESTION:

Are charges routinely made for these

negotiations, Mr. Loevinger?
MR. LOEVINGER:
There is no engagement.

No, sir, there are no charges made.
There Is no obligation on the part of

the client at this stage of the proceeding.
QUESTION:

There is a good deal of engineering work

that goes into the sale of some complex electrical equipment
that's manufactured by electrical equipment manufacturers, toe,
is there not?
MR. LOEVINGER:

This engineering principle' -- this

principle, incidentally, has four important exceptions.

first place, it is confined exclusively to the design -- to
work related to the design of real estate structures.

contracts.

It does not apply to, so-called, "turn key"

Engineering work that relates to the design of

products to be manufactured is not involved in this principle
for the very good reason that products are tested before they
are sold.

The reason that this applies is that real estate

structures aren't tested.

There are no prototypes.

R&D work, on the other hand, results in a prototype.

A prototype is thoroughly tested before it is exposed to the
public.

Whereas, real estate structures are occupied by the

It is exclusively confined

to matters that immediately affect the public interest.
QUjjJsTION:

So, you say, then, that this principle

which you are enunciating,which your clients have enunciated,
is an exception for the engineers from the per se rule only in
the case of structures on real property?
MR, LOEVINGiSR:

I don’t say it *§ an exception to the

per se rule, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,
doesn't apply.

I say that the per se rule

The argument for the per se rule applies be­

cause of a strained construction which says that because this
somehow or other affects price, therefore, it is price fixing,
therefore, the per se rule applies.

Actually, it's an entirely

circular argument,
QUESTION:

Perhaps I can ask you a question that will

solve my problem more quickly.
Your distinction for antitrust purposes between
manufacturers of electrical equipment,which may be a one-item
deal and may take a great deal of engineering design skill,
and your client's code of ethics is that your client’s code of
ethics applies only to structures on real property which are
not pretested for safety.
MR. LOiiVINGER:

Yes, precisely.

7
QUESTION:

Is there any way to -- I thought you said

there is really no way to test the structure —
MR. LOEVINGER:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justioe.

In the sense that you do a prototype of an

airplane, an automobile or a washing machine.
MR. LGEVINGER:

Yes, Mr.. Chief Justice.

That’s as I

understood Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question, thit this applies
only to real estate structures, precisely because they are not
subject to testing.

If you are designing equipment for sale,

whether it is automobiles or gadgets or jewelry, or whatever,
these are articles that are designed and manufactured in pro­
totype and tested before sale.
the protection of this testing.

Consequently, the public has
And there are many opportuni­

ties for testing.
QUESTION:

I suppose a substitute for that testing,

or at least a partial substitute, is the building inspection

.

/

which goes on from day to day or even hour to hour as a building
is going up.

Is that correct?

MR. LQEVINGER:

There is, in fact, testimony on that

precise subject which points out that the building codes are
not adequate substitutes for the. code of ethics because they
are usually behind times, because they are not effectively
enforced, because they do not subject the buildings to the
same kind of tests as they get from the engineer who was on
top of the job.

In any event, we argue that to say that because

8
there may be laws that relate to the same subject, therefore
ethics are not applicable, is as Inappropriate as to say that
because there are laws against homocide, therefore, we don’t
need the Fifth Commandment.
QUESTION:

There was something wrong out in Bailey's

Crossroads when that building came down, wasn't there?
MR, LGEVINGER:

Yes, sir.

That is one of the

incidents that was testified to by a witness whom vie called.
Probably no case that has ever come before this Court involving
the application of the rule of reason in which there has been
testimony that has been so inclusive.

We had as a witness the

head of the company that engineers -- I am sorry, that insures
over 60% of the professional engineers and architects of the
country and who had over a period of seventeen or eighteen
years personally investigated or in the later years when there
became more, personally supervised the Investigation of every
malpractice claim that arose for this entire group of engineers.
He kept statistics on the claims, on their causes.

He investi­

gated the conditions under which the solicitation occurred.
And, as a matter of fact, he concluded -- and the testimony
stands uncontroverted in the record -- that there was a high
correlation between the awarding of engineering jobs by bidding
and claims of malpractice, inadequacy or negligence, and it
reached such a point that his company finally concluded that
they would not issue malpractice insurance

when there was any

9
evidence that a job had been awarded by bidding.
inclusive the evidence was.

That's how

In fact, he testified that over

17>500 claims that he had investigated and at the time of his
testimony the claims were coming in at the rate of ten a day,
of which more than one every single day involved injury or
death to a member of the public.

That's how ubiquitous the

threat that we are confronting in this case is.

And the

Government takes the position that this is irrelevant.
don't take the position that simply it's not true.

They

They say

it should not be considered by the Court, and the courts below
believed them and proceeded on that basis.

And that is why we

are here today.
Now, there is the testimony of many eminent engineers
which stands, essentially, uncontreverted in the record, as to
the public value of the ethical method of awarding engineering
jobs and of the bidding method.

In the first place, the ethical

method encourages a free exchange of information among engineers,
the exchange of technical and scientific information, whereas,
bidding tends to make them like businessmen who seek to hoard
trade secrets, and there is a public value in this.

There is

no Government response to this point, and there were no findings
by any of the courts below.
The ethical method, it was well testified, produces
completely adequate plans which permits competitive bidding at
the construction phase which, incidentally, costs about twenty

10

times as much as the total cost of engineering, and, therefore,
increases and permits competition in construction, whereas,
bidding results in inadequate and incomplete plans and speci­
fications, and, therefore, frustrates competitive bidding at
the construction phase.

There was no response to this point

in the Government's brief and no findings below,

But, as wo explained, in fact, bidding is false,

Let me give you an example and, as a matter of fact,
there are two examples in the record.

The Government had a

massive discovery procedure and got thousands of documents,

all that.

And he does, and he defrauds people and

But why is this industry different from other

industries?
MR. LOEVINGER:

It is different because when there

is bidding for engineering services the consumer doesn't know
what he is getting.

There is no way to specify what he is

getting.
QUESTION:

These are unsophisticated buyers we are

dealing with.?

How much will you charge

There is no way to tell what he is talking

As a matter of fact, there is in the record an example

of almost this kind of a proposal which the Government put in
by way of exhibit and which it cites in Its brief as an example
of an invitation to bid which the Metropolitan Transit Authority

12

of New York talked about an Invitation to present engineering
bids on some — they don’t even say how many -- transportation
centers — some centers that serve five communitiesAnd this
invitation consists of five pages of questions.

You don’t even

have to be an engineer to read this invitation and find out
it doesn’t specify anything.

There isn't the vaguest idea of

what it is they want.
QUESTION:

Supposing you are selling computers and

the customer doesn't understand very much about it, would that
justify anticompetitive arrangements among computer manufactur­
ers?
MR. LQEVINGER:

Computers are not in the same situ­

ation.
QUESTION;

I am asking -- trying to understand --

what is the scope of the area in which you say the per se
rules don't apply or anticompetitive arrangements may be made?
Is it the difficulty of understanding the business on the part
of the buyer or the fact it is professional or the fact that
it is dangerous?
MR. LQEVINGER:

It is the fact that in the situation,

the special situation presented on the record here it is impos­
sible to specify in advance either what is sought or what is
being offered.

The buyer cannot specify.

No matter how expert

he is, he cannot know what it is that he seeks, because lie has
a problem.

He does not have a notion of the solution to the

13
problem.

He doesn't know how the problem is going to be solved,
QUESTION:

The rule identifies to the medical

profession and the legal profession quite clearly, because
that characteristic applies there.
MR, LOEVINOER:

As far as I am aware, medical " ;

problems are encompassed within a somewhat smaller scope
and don't involve —
QUESTION:

Surely the client when he goes to the

lawyer doesn’t understand the answer.
MR. LOEVINGER:

No, he doesn't have to understand

the answer.
The client who goes to the engineer doesn't know the
question.
QUESTION:

Does the rule that you are seeking the

Court to adopt apply to the legal profession as well as the
engineering profession?
MR. LOEVINGER:

I am not prepared to say that it

does because no such record has been made,

he have a very

extensive record here which presents precisely what the problems
are in engineering.

And, as I believe our initial brief points

out, there are substantial differences between the engineering
profession in this respect and the other learned professions,
law and medicine.

The engineer deals with problems of a dif­

ferent kind of order, different magnitude, different kind.
Engineers design vast structures.

They don't treat individuals,

14

by and large.

Whereas, the lawyer treats the individual.

There Is, as this Court has held certain — There are
certain functions which this Court has said in Bates can be
considered as repetitive and even as routine-

I understand

there are some differences among the Court on that point, but
we accept the majority opinion of the Court.

But the testimony

is clear and uncontroverted that there are no such matters in
engineering, that when a client goes to an engineer the defini­
tion of his problem becomes a matter that requires extensive
consultation and negotiation before it is possible to begin to
formulate a solution.
tion

Df

And after the beginning of the formula­

the solution — the testimony was that it took, about

a third.of the total amount of work before you arrived at
that point.

And then you formulate a solution, then the

engineer proposes a fee.

The client is still free to reject

it and to talk to other engineers.
QUESTION:

Well, it is part of your argument, isn't

it, Mr. I.oevlnger, that unlike the Virginia State Bar case,
this is not price-fixing.
MR, LOEVINGER:

This is not price-fixing.

this is the antithesis of price-fixing.

Indeed,

It is inherent in the

principle that we are arguing for that every single job shall
be separately negotiated and a fee separately arrived at, based
upon the scope of the work involved.

I can imagine nothing

more antithetical to price-fixing than the principle that we

15
here advocate.
QUESTION:

Well, even assuming that it is a concerted

action which affects price, nonetheless, your claim is, even
accepting that much, which I know you don’t, that in any event
it's not price-fixing, and therefore, just not amenable to any
per se rule that this Court has ever announced.
MR. LOEVINGER:
sir.

Precisely.

It is not price-fixing,

The most that can be said of it is that it affects the

time and manner of arriving at the price.

In that respect,

we believe, that it is an a fortiori case, under Chicago Board
of Trade.
QUESTION:

Mr. Loevinger, does your principle forbid

two engineers from engaging in the same conversations about the
same contract with the same client?
MR. LOEVINGER:

It doesn't say anything about that,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

So, it's, really just bidding.

It doesn’t

forbid competition.
MR. LOEVINGER: That's correct, sir.
QUESTION:

It is not unethical in this business for

an engineer to talk with a client when he knows that the client
has had precisely the same preliminary conversation

with

another engineer?
MR. LOEVINGER:

Well, indeed, it has been testified

that a client may have serially a whole series of conversations

16

QUESTION:

So that the principle is not to prevent

competition among engineers.
MS. LOEVINGER:
QUESTION:

That’s correct, sir.

Goldfarb, on the other hand, had a record

which showed that no lawyer consulted — and there was a great
many of them -- would do the work for less than the price
specified in the fee schedule.

That was price-fixing, clearly,

to the board tells.
MS. LOEVINGER:

Mr, Chief Justice, if I remember

Goldfarb correctly, it was specifically recited in your
opinion that no lawyer even asked for additional information
about the matter.

He simply quoted the fee schedule price.

This principle requires engineers to get in and find
out what the scope of the work is and, separately, consider
and ascertain what this involves and to arrive at an indepen­
dent judgment.
QUESTION:

What if one engineer has had this pre­

liminary conversation with a client,and he will give the
client some figures, won't he?
MR. LOEVINGER:

Yes, sir.

This has been testified

to.
QUESTION:
has a conversation.

Then the client goes to another one and
And the second one says, "Have you talked

with another engineer?"
figures?"

"Yes, I have."

"Did he give you some

"Yes, he gave me some figures," and so he gives the

17

second engineer the figures.

And the second engineer cuts them.

I mean he just gives them a lower bid, if you want to call it
that.

Is that forbidden by your ethical principle?
MR. LQEVINGER:

It would be forbidden if he did it

simply on the basis of saying, "Tell me how much the other man
I?

QUESTION:

No, no.

He has the conversation.

He goes

through the whole conversation.
MR. LQEVINGER:

If it is his independent judgment

that this is an appropriate figure, it is not forbidden, no,
sir.

It is encouraged.

And it, indeed, occurs.

There is

testimony to that effect.
QUESTION:

And the bid might be higher or lower.

MR. LQEVINGER:

It might be higher or lower, correct,

sir.
QUESTION:

If bid is the right word.

The response

may be —
MR. LQEVINGER:
QUESTION:

I prefer that word, yes, -sir,

Isn‘t there some restriction on when the

information may be given by the engineering firm to the client?
MR. LOEVINGER:

Yes, that is precisely what this is.

The engineer is not to give the client such information until
he has enough negotiation and consultation with the client to
be able to ascertain the scope of the work.
restriction

That's the

18

QUESTION;

Not until after he has been selected to

do the work.
MR. LOEVINGER:

Well, it is an initial selection,

It does not Involve an engagement, Mr. Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

It does involve an initial selection and

all that's left after that is to negotiate the price of the
service.
MR. LOEVINGER:

No, it has to negotiate the scope of

the work, which Involves the fee for the services.

But it is

impossible for an engineer to talk to a client until the client
has selected that engineer for the purposes of conversation.
This is simply inherent in the nature of the problem.
QUESTION:

But a client can find out how much it is

going to cost him and still walk away from the engineer.
MR. LOEVINGER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

No question about It.

He can’t find out how much it's going to

cost him until the engineer has a general notion of the scope
of the work.
MR. LOEVINGER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

That is correct.

And if It is a big bridge, for example,

the engineer might have to invest a great deal of time which he
is then at risk of losing without compensation.
MR. LOEVINGER:

This happens, yes, sir, no doubt

about it.
I find that I have only ten minutes left.

19

Mr, Chief Justice, I think that the basic principle
has been explained to the Court.
I would like to reserve my time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Shapiro,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD E. SHAPIRO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SHAPIRO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
It would be useful, I think, for us to look at the
text of the ethical rule which is the subject of this litiga­
tion.

It is printed in the Government's brief at page 4, as

well as in the various opinions of the district Court, the
Court of Appeals and findings.

It defines competitive bidding

os "the formal or informal submission or receipt of verbal or
written estimates of cost or proposals in terms of dollars,
man-days of work required, percentage of construction cost,
or any other measure of compensation whereby the prospective
client may compare engineering services on a price basis, prior
to the time that one engineer or engineering organization has
been selected for negotiation.

The disclosure of recommended

fee schedules prepared by various engineering societies is not
considered to be competitive bidding."
Mow, the purpose and effect of the rule were found
by the two courts below to be the total suppression of price

20

competition.

The Court of Appeals described it as a price

maintenance mechanism.
Petitioner does not challenge any of the findings
of the .District Court as clearly erroneous, and they were found
not to be clearly erroneous by the court belox-j.
QUibSTION:

Well, they just suggested, as X understand

it, that a client may have a conversation with one engineer
and get a price from him and have a conversation with another
engineer and get a price from him.
MR. SHAPIRO:

I must respectfully disagree with my

colleague on that.
.QUESTION:

Yes, but that's what he --

MR. SHAPIRO:
CUBBTIUN:

That's his contention.

That's his contention.

And you think the

findings below are contrary to that?
MR. SHAPIRO:

That is my understanding.

Certainly,

Professional Policy 10(f), which is their interpretation of
the rule that's incorporated into its enforcement and applica­
tion, does provide that although a client may talk to other
engineers sequentially, he can't do it simultaneously.

He is

required to completely sever the relations before approaching
another firm,
Or, putting it another way, other engineers will not
talk to the client while he is talking to another engineer.
is considered unethical.

It

21

QUESTION:

Are there findings in the record that

attest to that fact, or not?
MR, SHAPIRO:

The District Court didn't make a

specific finding to that effect.

I would refer the Court to

Joint Appendix —
QUESTION:

Because, if it is, that's just saying

what the rule means is that one engineer won't compete with
another.
MR. SHAPIRO:

That’s what the rule means, according

to what the courts beloxv found, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

You were going to give us an Appendix

QUESTION:

medical profession, unless there is open consultation?

don't know the answer to your question, Your Honor.

I

But I

would like to return to the record here because this is a
worthwhile point.
The rule on its face does not permit the disclosure
of any price comparison information.

So that, since you have

no price comparison information, you simply cannot have any
kind of price competition.

There is no competition.

It is

something of a paradox, I think, for the Petitioner to argue.
QUESTION:

How can the rule prevent -- keep a client

from disclosing the price he got from one engineer to another?
MR. SHAPIRO:

It can't keep the client from doing it,

but it can encourage the engineer not to talk to the client.
And that 's what happens, because this rule is' enforced. In

QUESTION:

Then the second engineer, under this

rule, shouldn’t listen to any price information received from
the former one.

23

MR. EHAPIRQ:

Shouldn't even talk to the client

until he knows that the first engineer has totally withdrawn.
If there has been a negotiation and they have failed to reach
agreement on a price, then he can come in and talk.
VJhat we have, therefore, is not any kind of price
comparison or price competition.

You have nothing but bargain­

ing and that 's all that’s allowed.
practical effects.

Now, this has significant

It means that the client seeking to go from

one engineer to another has a very significant search cost.
It is an expensive project.
QUESTION;

It takes time.

How can an intelligent bid be made without

— on a large project -- without a very great deal of explora­
tion and study and discussion?

They don’t have specifications

handed to them, as a contractor does, do they?
MR* SHAPIRO:

No.

And that's why no one suggests

that there has to be rigid, absolute advertised price bidding.
The Sherman Act doesn't require that.

What the Sherman Act

condemns in this case is the collective imposition on clients
and on engineers of a bar that let's then consider any aspect
of price.

They can’t even ask the engineer, "What's your

hourly rate?" to give themselves some idea before they begin
going further.
These are matters —
QUESTION:

Now, wait a minute.

can’t ask the engineer.

You say that they

These rules can’t control the clients.

24
The engineer may be prohibited from quoting an hourly rate.
MR, SHAPIRO:

I mean as a practical matter they

can’t ask, because not only will the engineer not quote it,
but if the client persists in asking any engineer, the rule
says, and the record shows, that the engineer approached must
withdraw.
In short, what we would have here — and this is how
the rule is actually enforced -- is not only a rule against
price comparison information, but a rule that restricts the
disclosure of price information except where minimum fixed
fee schedules are 'involved and, in addition, is enforced by
boycotts.

And we have incidents where that kind of a threat

has been made,.
QUESTION:

Mr, Shapiro, you said toward the outset,

I think, of your remarks, that there was no claim here that
the findings of the District Court, approved by the Court of
Appeals, were erroneous.

I call your attention to Appendix to the Petition
for Writ of Certiorari, page A-ll, which no more than incor­
porates the — sets out, reproduces the opinion, Judge
Leventhal's opinion for the Court of Appeals, in which he says,
and I am reading,

'Ve approve the approach taken by the

district court, its comment that the Rule is classic pricefixing, and hence illegal ’per se.
I understood Mr. Loevlnger strongly to contest that,

25

that this is, whatever else it is, it is not classic price­
fixing to which any per se rule has ever attached.

And the

District Court and the Court of Appeals explicitly found that
it was.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes, they did, Your Honor, and

Mr. Loevinger contests the ultimate —
QUESTION:

No, no, this characterization of it.

He says that this is not price-fixing of a kind that any per se
rule has ever attached to, in any decision of this Court.
Didn't you understand him to say much the same thing.
MR. SHAPIRO:

He said in his contention in this

Court ~~
QUESTION:

And in his brief and in the District Court

and in the Court of Appeals, I presume.
MR. SHAPIRO:

But, as far as the findings of fact in

the District Court, the specific findings, he does not suggest
that this rule has any other effect than what has been described
for it.

He doesn't argue that there is any.disclosure of price

information.

He doesn't argue that there is any price compe­

tition under the rule.
QUESTION:

But that's quite different from price-

fixing, which is an agreed upon, uniform single price.

That's

what prlc e-fixing means.
QUESTION:

Gold fa rb price-fixing.

MR. SHAPIRO:

In that sense, the engineers have agreed

among themselves to maintain a certain price, the answer is
no, they haven’t agreed —
QUESTION:

So, the District Court and the Court of

Appeals were wrong if we are talking about price-fixing in that
rather pristine sense of its —
MR. SHATIRO:

The Court of Appeals was more careful,

QUESTION:

J just read you what the Court of Appeals

says, "Vie approve of the District Court’s description that this
is classical price-fixing,"
MR. SHAPIRO:

Because of its overall effect, because

there has been a total suppression of price competition here.
There can’t be ar.y -QUESTION:

Viell, on the tip of your tongue, what are

the cases here that say that if competitors agree not to compete,
that is per se illegal?
MR. EHAPIRO:

VJe would point to Container Corp.

he would point to

*• *■
QUESTION: Did the cases say it’s per se because it
is the other side of the coin from price-fixing?
MR* SHAPIRO:

In effect, yes.

If there is a tamper­

ing with the price system that so operates that price competi­
tion can’t function -- and that's what’s involved here -- then
that is also illegal, per se.

That's what Eocony says.

That’s

27

what Container describes, and that is what, we are arguing here.
QUESTION:

Where would we find in this record evidence

or a finding that they agreed in advance, the engineers agreed
among themselves in advance, on certain prices, such as is
found in Goidfarb?
MR, SHAPIRO:
that.

You won’t find that.

We don’t charge

Vi ha t we charge is a total suppression of price compe­

tition.

What the District Court found was a total suppression

of price competition.

What the Court of Appeals affirmed was

a finding that there was a total suppression of price compe­
tition, and they found it so closely related to price-fixing
that they considered it to be the same thing.
QUESTION:

How could they have found agreement not

to compete on the facts in this record?
MR. SHAPIRO:

The language of the rule so provides

if you totally suppress all price comparison information you
are agreeing -'...

QUESTION:

t

There is nothing like any sort of a

territorial allocation, or any of those agreements not to
compete.

Isn’t there a good deal of competition among

engineers to get clients' business.
MR. SHAPIRO;

Yes, there is, but not price compe­

tition, Your Honor, and that’s what we are talking about,
total suppression of price competition, or the possibility of
price competition.

28

I just suggested a moment ago that no one is arguing
that clients or engineers have to resort to some sort of rigid
competitive bidding.

They can decide for themselves the extent

to which they will consider price,
QUESTION:

Vihat if the rule was no engineer gets a

price until he has had a talk, a good enough talk, and at
the end of it he can give a price, but that it is perfectly
all right for a second engineer to talk to the same client,
know what the price offered wa9, but after he has had a good
enough talk he can give a price.

Now, if that were the case,

would you be here or not?
MR. SHAPIRO:

If we permitted simultaneous discussion

that would be a different case, but simultaneous discussion is
not allowed, only sequential discussion is allowed under this
rule, and this effect -QUESTION:

And it is not enough for you, if there

can only be sequential discussion, but the second fellow can
know all lie needs to know about what the first fellow offers
that still isn't enough for you?
MR. SHAPIRO:

If there can only be sequential

discussion, then the client suffers a very severe and burden­
some additional cost.
QUESTION:

The client can always go back to the first

engineer.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Always go back to the first, but the

29

point is that there isn’t an opportunity for price comparison
in the way that price comparison is available everywhere else
in our economy.
QUESTION:

In this very large record that’s been

compiled, Is there any expert testimony making comparisons,
analogies with the legal profession, the medical profession?
MR, SHAPIRO:

No, Your Honor,

There was expert

There were officials and members -~

officials past and present of NS PE who, as engineers, testify
that in their opinion price competition or price comparison
would be very harmful and undesirable.
on cross-examination:

When they were asked

"Do you have any specific instances

in which it has ever been shown that safety is impaired by the
existence of some consideration of price," they would invariably
answer, "I have no specific instances."

executive, Mr, Duval,

Was there an appropriate foundation laid

Did he testify that he had examined the

Bailey’s Crossroads -MB, SHAPIRO:

No, he didn’t, Your Honor»

He was

testifying from his experience as an insurance executive in
the business of insuring engineers and construction people.
He gave a great many examples, but if each one is examined in
detail, one finds that what he described was the faot that
accidents can occur when there is bad engineering or dishonestengineering.
QUESTION:

In the Bailey’s Crossroads incident had

the engineers competed for the engineering job?
MR, SHAPIRO:

The record doesn’t show, as far as I

kn ow*
Well, proceeding on with the effects of this rule,
what we see is that it is based on two premises, one, that
engineering clients should always be kept in ignorance of the
price comparison information, for their own good.

They can’t be

allowed to know anything about price comparison information,
and engineers can’t be trusted to do their job safely if client
can make price comparisons*
to the client.

So it denies relevant information

It prevents the engineers from offering service

on their own terms.

It allows only price bargaining, not price

competition, because it totally suppresses price competition.
The rule is certainly not' pro-competitive, unlear you want to

31

say that the total suppression of competition is pro-competitive.
Now, these were the findings —
QUESTION:

The question is was it a per ae violation,

not admitting the possibility of any justification in terms of
the rule of reason?
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

And our argument is -~

Is, of course, it has to be that it Is,

MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes, Your Honor, and that it really is

a classic case of price-fixing because it serves as a price
maintenance device.
The economic testimony in this case by Professor
Arnold of the University of Illinois,who was a Government
witness, was to the effect that with this kind of a rule
engineers do not have any incentive to cut their prices,
because they are not competing with each other.

They have

an incentive to cut the costs, but not the prices.
have a kind of price maintenance effect.

So you

And that's what

Judge Leventhal summarised these findings as meaning.
Now, I should say that a per Be rule here does not
bar NS PE from adopting any kind of specific rules.

It requires

aims at fraud, at deception, at overreaching, at disregard of
engineering standards.

These are rules aimed at spec ific

abuses, but they were not before this Court.

They were not

The only thing before the Court

is this total aberration of price competition,

c

32

It is suggestel that the case should, nevertheless,
be reviewed under the Rule of Reason because a learned pro­
fession Is involved, because price competition isn’t feasible
in engineering or because engineering affects public safety.
Well, as I understand:it, NSPE now concedes that
except for real estate construction, price competition is
feasible in engineering.
tacks.

It is certainly practical for routine

It applies in the most difficult area of all, research

and development contracts, where it ia most difficult to pre­
dict what costs will be.

And the engineers, themselves, have

had fixed-fee schedules for years in their state.societies
which this rule specifically refers to.

Now, that, again,

implies that there are certainly tasks where price information
• can be disclosed.
The second possibility for a Rule of Reason argument
is that there is a learned profession exemption.

Certainly,

in Goldfarb, there was a rote of caution sounded in Footnote
17.

The Court, in holding that Goldfarb involved classic

price-fixing and that the learned professions were not exempt,
also said in Footnote 17 there might be situations where the
public service obligations of the learned professions require
a different approach under the Antitrust Laws.

"We express

no view except with respect to the matters before ug,"
I think the short answer is that, yes, in the
learned professions there may be..-different public service

,

33
requirement a that justify a Rule of Reason approach where they
wouldn't apply in other professions, or other activities.
rUKSTION:

How do we know a learned profession when

we see one?
MR, tiHAPIRO:

That is one of the problems, that the

term is not defined and would have to be explored»

I don't

contest the learned profession nature of the engineering
profession.

We didn't contest it below.

But X do suggest

that whatever the scope of the learned profession caution
light in Footnote I'J may be in Goldfarb, it does not authorize
the total suppression of all price competition, because price
is the central nervous system of our economy.
Finally, there is another aspect to this learned
profession problem.

Up to now in the Antitrust laws, we have

not considered Rule of Reason or per se, except in terms of
the marketplace, in terms of competitive effects.

A per se

rule is a rule which, on balance between pro-competitive effects
and anti-competitive effects, almost always has anti-competitive
effects, and, therefore, we don't make any further inquiry.
A Rule of Reason approach says, "Let's see what the
other competitive effects are."

But there has been a caution

in the law since Trenton Potteries not to step beyond competi­
tion, which is what the dherman Act 1b concerned about -- for
the courts not to step beyond competition and to go into the
questions of social policy that involve other justifications.

34
Now, in this record, we have a rather strongly con­
tested contention that public safety requires the abolition
of price competition in engineering.

There is a contrary view.

Vje presented an expert witness, former .Assistant Secretary of
the Air Force, who said there is no objective evidence to
support the view that price competition results in unsafe
practices.
QUESTION;

Mr. Shapiro, what do you think Congress

had in mind when it enacted the Brooks Act?
MR. SHAPIRO:

The Brooks Act is a good example of

what we are contending for, namely, that the client should
decide for himself whether, and to what extent, he wants to
consider price.

The Brooks Act certainly wasn't an exception

to the Antitrust Laws.

It represented a judgment by Congress

in a particular area of Government procurement that engineering
services would be acquired by the so-called "traditional
method."

Many States also have such provisions and we don't

QUESTION:

May I ask you this question:

I don't recall, specifically, that it

It did include a discussion of the then pending report

of the Commission on Government Procurement and noted that
the matter was still under discussion.

That report,which is

in the record, concluded here that — It's GX-3^o — concluded
that there is no objective evidence that there is a threat to
safety because of price competition.
The problem with relying cn public safety arguments

balance public safety against competition or seme other non­
competition factor against the suppression of price competi­
tion is that it is a slippery slope.

QUESTION:

And you don't think the Brooks Act bears

at all on whether or not the per Be rule should be applied in
this case?
MR, SHAPIRO:
QUl&STION:

No, we do not, Your Honor.

Then you have Congress saying, "We prefer

to get engineering services by this particular method, but

just remember that we have another statute that says that no
one else may bo It.

No one else shall have this privilege."

MR. SRAPIRO:

considerations itself and lift or —
QUESTION:

And say that because it is such an

unreasonable method that it should be, per se, illegal.
MR» SHAPIRO:

What- is unreasonable is the concerted

imposition -QUESTION:

Well, your answer is yes.

Can you say

that these two statute, side-by-side, you can ride both horses?
MR. EHAPIRO:

Yes, we can, Your Honor.

And I will explain it in this way.

What the Sherman

Act is aimed at Is the concerted imposition of the suppression
of price competition by private action.

What the Brooks Act

reflects is the decision by Congress or an appropriate
Government agency to forego price competition.
If this case stands, it. doesn 't mean that there is
going to be price competition across-the-board.

Some engineering

clients are going to say, "Let's just pick the engineer we
consider the best and talk with him.

If we can't reach a price,

we'll go through sequential negotiations."

Some people will

attempt what was attempted by the Department of Defense here
until it was frustrated by a boycott by the National Society of
Professional Engineers, as the District Court expressly found.
That was an experiment, under which there viere two proposals:

37
"Let's have your technical proposals/' which the engineers
were willing to submit, and "We will rank you on your technical
proposals, engineers, and then submit to us your price pro­
posals, and then we will see whether we change our mind about
our rankings of the technical proposals."
That project failed in the summer of 1970.
QUESTION:

Did that take into account whether the

particular engineer who had made a bid had ever engaged in that
kind of work before?

Suppose it was a bridge to replace the

about price.
circumstances.

They may not want to know anything

It depends on the nature of the project and the
Borne projects are so repetitive that they can

almost be.handled like standard construction bidding contracts.
Others would be so unique, for instance, a research and develop
ment contract, to which price competition applies, incidentally
that you might not really want to let it in the ordinary sense.
The extent to which price goes into the equation is
something for the client and engineer to decide for themselves.
That's a?.l we are arguing for, not to have it determined by a
private organization.
QUESTION:

That sounds something closely approaching

38
£ Rule of Reason.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, we think that it follows almost

automatically from applying the per ge approach.

The conse­

quence — I mean as far as the client is concerned — applying
the Antitrust Laws in this way, lets-

the reasoned choice,

the Rule of Reason, let me put it that way, be applied by the
individual client or the individual engineer.
QUESTION:

Of course, that's not what the Rule of

Reason means as a term of art in Antitrust Law, at all, is it?
MR. SHAPIRO:

No,

In Antitrust Law, the rule really

means that balancing pro-competitive and anti-competitive
effects, not all kinds of social considerations.
QUESTION:

And it doesn't mean you can justify it

for safety reasons either.
reasons.

It justifies for competitive

The rule tends to promote competition.
MR. SHAPIRO:

That is exactly the point.

And if

there is to be a justification for safety reasons, that the
Congress should make that kind of decision.
Now, one very brief word on the judgment in this
case.

It has been attacked as being over-broad and violating

the First Amendment.

We think that If It is examined it will

be seen that if the finding of liability stands here that
this judgment precisely fits the violation found, because it
simply calls for a correction of the practice by eliminating
the ethical restraint from any provisions of NS PE's rules by

39
barrine any attempt to achieve the same result through affili­
ated state societies, by eliminating the fixed-fee schedules
mentioned in any of the rules and preventing continuation of
the practice.
QUESTION:

You are speaking of the judgment as

modified by the Court of Appeals?
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

As modified by the Court of Appeals.

And the modification you do not quarrel

with?
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

We do not quarrel with it, no.

Mr. Shapiro, one last question.

What is

the significance — What's the Government's view of the signifi­
cance of the fact, as I understand It, that before serious
negotiations begin and when it is appropriate to talk price
there is a lot of work done by the engineering firm and there
is no charge during that period?

That is a correct version of

MR. 8EAPIR0:

It's not absolute.

There

There may be a charge for

what amounts to an initial consultation.
QUESTION:

It varies.

The rule --

I had the impression the general practice

was that it takes quite a bit of work to find out what a job
— what is the scope of the job.

And during that period the

preliminary work is really not paid for.
MR, EHAPIRO:

Let me refer the Court to a definition

40

of engineering services in Professional Policy 10(g) which
was adopted by the engineers in 1972, and which is the basis
for their restriction of this practice to real estate con­
struction.

Prior to that time, under Policy 10(f), it applied

to everything, as we read the rule, at least it literally did.
It defines engineering services as including pre­
feasibility and feasibility studies.

So that comprehensive

and general planning, preliminary studies, preparation of
drawings, plans, designs, specifications, in short, the rule
defining engineering services recognizes that there may be
paid services that amount to fairly preliminary conversation,
preliminary study,
QUESTION:

Do you understand the rule to permit the

firm to quote in advance a fee on doing a pre-feasibility study?
MR. SHAPIRO;

It is an engineering service, and

therefore they cannot do that either.

They cannot quote a

price, or they can't even tell what their hourly rates are.
QUESTION:

Until after the pre-feasibility study is

d one?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Until, after they've negotiated, until

they've been accepted by the client.

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEE LOEVINGER, ESQ-.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LOEVINGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I think that the last colloquoy illustrates the
difficulties of the per se rule as applied in this case.
Mr. Shapiro didn’t try the case.

I believe he is not fairly

familiar with the record and his application of 10(g) is simply
erroneous.
Mr. Justice Stevens is entirely correct that in
negotiating the scope of the work and the possibility of
engagement by a client there is no charge.
clear.

This is eminently

The difficulty is that you can't take a simple rule,

particularly when drafted by engineers -- you can’t even take
one drafted by lawyers -- but you can’t take a general rule
drafted by engineers and apply it without understanding the
circumstances out of which it grew, any more than you can take
the Eherman Act and talk about the Rule of Reason, the per se
rule and all the rest of this, without having some idea of
the interpretations made by this in other courts.

And, indeed,

the engineers had a formal body known as the Board of Ethical
Review which made these interpretations and there are these
interpretations,and there is a body of testimony relating to
this matter which makes it perfectly clear -- and Mr. Ehapiro
misinterprets Policy 10(g).

Incidentally, earlier in his

42

argument, he referred to Policy 10(f), which was superseded by
Policy 10(g), and simply isn't in effect and isn't Involved.
QUESTION:

What about simultaneous conversations,

Mr. Loevinger?
MR.. LOEVINGER:

Mr. Justice White, I think the

difficulty with simultaneous conversations are that they are
a little bit like simultaneous consultations with a doctor.
It is very difficult to see how you could get simultaneous -QUESTION:

That may be, but does' the rule forbid

them?
MR. LOEVINGER:

There is nothing in the record,

nothing in the rule that I am aware of that forbids them.
QUESTION:

Mr, Shapiro says that there is.

MR. LOEVINGER:

Well, there is nothing in the record.

I am familiar with the record.

I know the record.

I've read

the briefs, and if there is anything in it I would like to
have it referred to because I am not familiar with it.

The

rule is as it stands, and there is simply no testimony.
QUESTION:

Well, what was the basis for his saying

then — I guess I should have asked him -- saying that the rule
forbids an engineer to talk to a client if he is already talking
to an engineer, until his relationship with the first engineer
has terminated?

What's the basis for that?

MR. LOEVINGER:

There is testimony that once a

client has begun talking to an engineer he has to complete bis

conversations with that engineer before consulting another.
That they say.
QUESTION:

So, he is right on that.

You just won't

find under this rule one engineer dealing with the same client
that already has an engineer.
MR. LOEVINGER:

Marching in in the middle of a

consultation, that is correct.
QUESTION:

Simultaneous conversations are not

permitted under the rule?
MR, LOEVINGER:

I wouldn't say they are not permitted.

They are certainly not favored.
QUESTION:

On a strict factual question like that,

I am surprised that counsel are not able to cane to closer
agreement, frankly.
MR. LOEVINGER:

The question — There were seventeen

I don't believe the question was asked of any of

them.
QUESTION:

It certainly is not irrelevant, is it?

MR. LOEVINGER: I. think it is not a practical
It is about as impractical as simultaneous consultation with
doctors.

I believe this is the difficulty.
QUESTION:

the rule:

Mr. Loevinger, what does this mean in

It says — according to page 4 of the Government's

brief -- an engineer requested to submit a fee proposal of bid
prior to the selection of an engineer or firm subject to the

negotiation of a satisfactory contract shall attempt to have
the procedure changed to conform to ethical practices, but if
not successful he shall withdraw from consideration for the
proposed work.
What does that mean?
MR. LOEVINGER:

It means that if an engineer is

asked to cbme in and give a bid prior to the opportunity to
discuss with the client the scope and nature of the work that
he shall not do it.
QUESTION:

The testimony is pretty clear on that.
Let me see if I can get that concretely.

Suppose a building is pointed to by a prospective client and
they say to the engineer, "Vie want a building just like that
one.

What will it cost?
MR. LOEVINGER:

project is a false issue.

Will you give us a figure right now?"
Mr. Chief Justice, the repetitive
If what a client wants is a building

just exactly like the one that has been erected, all he has to
do is to use the plans and specifications for that building.
He has already got them.

By definition, he's got the building,

he's had it erected,
QUESTION:

I am speaking now of a building that he

did not engineer himself, someone else did.

Is there anything

to prevent him from going to the other engineer and getting the
plans?
MR. LOEVINGER:

The testimony is clear that there are

not two identical buildings.

You can't build it in the same

place.

In a different place, you’ve got different problems.

You have sub-soil problems.
traffic problems.

You have wind problems.

You have

There are a host of different problems.

And, in order even to determine the distance between partially
repetitive projects you have to consult with the client and
find out what it is.

Where do you want that other building?

Where is it going to be designed?
the soil going to be like?

What's the purpose?

What’s

There are a host of problems.

cisely the problem.

There aren't identical problems.

You can't

That’s a hypothetical that simply —
QUESTION:

Suppose I am a client and I go to an

engineer and I have as much talk as Mr. Loevinger thinks 1
ought to have.

And I talk to him and X want a proposal from

him, and the engineer gives it to me.

And then I say to the

engineer, "By the way, X am going to take this proposal and
submit it to another engineer.

And I am going to certainly

talk to him all he wants to talk about."
wrong with that?

Now, what would be

Why would that be unethical?

MR. LOEVINGER:

There is nothing in the Rules of

Ethics that relate to this.
fUESTION:

As a matter of fact —

I thought you said the second engineer

shouldn't talk to the client until he has terminated his
relationship with the. first.
MR. LOEVINGER:

At this point he has.

QUESTION:

He hasn’t.

He says to the first one,

out of the next fellow."

QUESTION:

The consultation

This, in fact, does happen.
Then, the word "terminated" is about

like talking to a used car dealer.

You know, you say — one

guy will give it to you for $4400 and you say, "I'll come back
in a few hours and if it is still there I'll buy it."

Mean­

while, you go out and talk to three or four others.
MR. LQEVINGER:
)

This is conceivable,

I don't know.

I understand that the practice isn’t exactly like that of used
car dealers, but there is nothing that relates to this, the
testimony is clear, that there can be and are serial consulta­
tions .
QUESTION:

But "terminated" is not a word of origin -

MR, LOBVINGER:
QUESTION:

No, it Is not.

Suppose the first man says, "Number one,.

I don't think you can terminate it.

MR, LQKVTNGER:

I don’t know.

Mr. Justice Marshall, I’d have to say that the
record — again, this is one of those things that, despite
everything, was not explored either on examination or crossexamination.

It would seem to me that had the conversations

progressed to the point where the first engineer had been
fully consulted, had made a fee proposal as to the scope of
the work:.

The man said, "Okay, now I want to go see somebody

else," that that is termination for the purposes of this thing.
The point is these are not words of art.

Vie have no problem

with the concept that this may be inartisticaliy stated.

Indeed

we have stated from the very beginning that It can be reformu­
lated, that the principle can be restated in any manner that
is necessary in order to explore ~~
QUESTION:

Mr. Loevinger, just using lawyer's

language, when does this rule require the engineer to withdraw
from consideration of the proposed work?

Describe.some situ­

ation in which the engineer has a duty under the rule to with­
draw.

When does that happen?
MR. LOEVINGER:

When he is asked to give a fee bid

before he has had an opportunity to study the nature and scope
of the work.
QUESTION:

I see.

QUESTION:

Mr. Loevinger, wouldn't you say that the

rule at least forbids this.

The client calls up the engineer

and says, "I want to talk to you about a building."

When the

48
engineer arrives there, he finds another engineer there,

An3

the client says to both of them, "Mow, look, we are going to
have to talk as long and as hard as necessary so you both
will understand the scope of the work and everything else,
And then I want you both to listen, ask as many questions as
you want to and I want you both to go off and give me a
proposal."
Mow, I take it the rule forbids that.
MR. LOEVINGER:
QUESTION:

The rule forbids that.

Why would it forbid that?

That certainly

isn't impractical.
MR. LOEVINGER:
Mr. Justice White,

The engineers consider it impractical,
i
They consider simultaneous — that they are

stepping on each other's toes.
QUESTION:

80 that is an example when both engineers

should withdraw.
MR. LOEVINGER:

At least one of them, in fact, yes,

should.
What this basically all comes down to is that if
you apply the per se rule there is no way to accommodate what
the Government and the Court of Appeals concede to be a legiti­
mate objective to the demands of the Antitrust law.

It is only

by the application of the Erie of Reason that the law can be
accommodated to what both the Government and the Court of
Appeals concede to be a legitimate objective.
