MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Vie will hear arguments

next in 70-6528, Burks against United States,
Mr. Durham.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BART C. DURHAM, III, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, DURHAM:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case arose in Nashville, Tennessee.

It was a

bank robbery which occurred there some two years ago,

The

defendant, at his arraignment, interposed a plea of not guilty
by reason of Insanity,
At that time in the Sixth Circuit, we were operating
under the Smith

.mle, which we presently are today, known as

"smith One, *' the case decided in 1968.

The defendant, as I

said, entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, and
on motion of the Government he was ordered to be examined for
mental competency.

The order of the District Court which re­

quired him to be examined set out the three rules which the '
oixth Circuit, which uses the ALI rule, basically'requires,
and ordered the physician to report to the court and the United
States Attorney the answers to those questions.
Trial came on sometime later and the issue was
contested on the facts at the trial, but the trial transcript,
almost the bulk of it, if not probably the bulk, is consumed

4
with really the only defense, and that is insanity*

The United

States used a psychiatrist and a psychologist as their witnesses„
They also used lay persons in the toank and a cab driver who was
kidnapped just before the robbery for a few moments.

As I said,

they used the lay witnesses In the bank and they used the FBI
agents who apprehended him just a few moments after the bank
robbery and made the arrest„
The defendant used as his experts the family of the
defendant who testified to bizarre, erratic and unusual behavior,
and three medical witnesses, two highly qualified psychiatrists,
one of whom had been used, a Ur. Munden, who had been used many
times by the United States as their choice to examine potential
defendants interposing insanity defenses and —
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting we shall inquire into

or try to re-evaluate the qualifications of the expert witnesses?
MR. DURHAM:

Wo, sir.

My point is just saying that

there were five medical expert witnesses and it was extensively
presented to the trial court.
The United States Court of Appeals for the .«ixfch
Circuit looked into that matter and they reversed the case
under the authority of 28 U.S.C. 2106 Federal Statute, which
empowers this Court and the Courts of Appeal to enter such
orders as are just and appropriate.
The Sixth Circuit, in my opinion, made, a finding of
fact that the Government did not make a prima facie case.

5
Counsel for the United States has raised the question of
whether --.raised by the members of the Court a few minutes
earlier -- as to whether the Government made a prime facie case
or to what extent one might read that opinion of the bixth
Circuit»

But, in any event, they found that because of in­

sufficient evidence the case should be remanded.
The Sixth Circuit cited the Bryan rule which has been
discussed today.

As Your Honors know, and as I've set out, there

was no criminal appeal except in extraordinary cases until 1890something and then, I believe, only in capital cases.

And in

1898, the Ball rule came forth which was an attack on double
jeopardy and it is the leading case in that, and set forth
the rule of waiver in which it was said that sometimes someone
who got a new trial was either starting on a clean slate or
that there was continuing jeopardy, or that by asking for a new
trial he had waived it.
Much of my brief is taken up with rebutting the waiver
rationale in light of this Court's later opinions, and partioularly in light of the Green decision of this Court.

I believe

the Solicitor General's brief — a fair reading of that
pretty much agrees with me that waiver is not an issue.

With

respect to waiver where one specifically asks for a new trial
as well as a judgment of acquittal ~~ which was a question
asked sometime ago -- I would only say that any defendant would
rather have an acquittal rather than a new trial.

If that's the

6
only choice with which he is faced* then it is no choice at
all.

Whereas, In this case, we asked the District Judge both

for a new trial, we filed a motion for a new trial alleging
»

other errors -QUESTION;

What about the choice between a new trial

and a judgment of conviction?
MR. DURHAM;

A new trial and a judgment of con­

viction, that's one which a defendant on appropriate occasions
prefers a judgment of conviction in light of Jackson y,
JteInchrone and some of the cases this Court has decided that
he might get more time on the second -QUESTION;

Well, suppose in the trial court you move

for a judgment of acquittal, on insufficiency of the evidence,
move for a new trial on the ground it's against the weight of
the evidence, or whatever the rule may provide*

Your motion

for judgment of acquittal is denied, your motion for new trial
is granted.

Jo you think that at the ccmmencement of that

second trial you can then raise a double jeopardy claim?
MR0 DURHAM:
QUESTION:
MR. DURHAM;

No, sir.
Why not?
VIell, assuming it was denied

Assuming

it was spelled out, if you were denying it —
QUESTION:

Supposing it is just a minute order of the

trial judge, motion for judgment n.o.v. denied, motion for new
trial granted on the grounds of ~~ against the weight of the

MR. DURHAM:

No, sir.

I don't think you could.

I think the only -- you would be limited to that to where it
was clear it went to the sufficiency of the evidence, and if it
was just a minute order I don't think you would have enough of
a record, really.
QUESTION:

He is being tried a second time for the

How can that be done under the Double Jeopardy

Clause?
MR. DURHAM:

Well, it is one of the exceptions.

One

must bring one’s self within the exceptions and 1 don’t think
that one properly has in that instance.
Bryan v. United States was what I believe to be the
first considered opinion.
Court.

It was decided in 1950 by this

As I point out, it was a twelve-paragraph decision.

It was decided a few months, or within a short time after the
new Rules of Federal Criminal Procedure were adopted, and it
was primarily concerned, in my judgment, with the application
of the rules that involve the district court vis-a-vis the
power of the Court of Appeals.

And the Court did have language

in there and did say in the final paragraph that it does not
violate the double jeopardy provision of the United States
Constitution to re-try a man the second time for insufficient
evidence.

i

Subsequent to 195° In the Bryan case, it has been

8
the subject of nothing but uncomplimentary articles both in
the courts, discussions in the courts and in the Law Review
articles, to the fact that Bryan was wrongly decided.

And if

X read the brief of the United States fairly, I believe that
they are willing to give a great deal on Bryan, although they
are not, of course, willing to give all.

In fact, if I read the

brief fairly for the United States, we can almost make the
argument that they are willing to give this cast: but they wish
to urge the Court that the Bryan overruling, if such be the
case, not be extended to all cases where the evidence is in­
sufficient to support the verdict.
The reasons advanced for double jeopardy occurring
where the evidence is insufficient to support the verdict have
been numerous.

Since 1950, I think, we've seen an increase in

decisions on double jeopardy,

rouble jeopardy as a hierarchy

of rights has taken a strong position.
Some of the reasons which I would urge on the Court
why this distinction should be allowed would be as follows♦
And before I get to that let me point out the difference
between reversals for procedural errors and reversals for in­
sufficient evidence,
Where the case is reversed for procedural error,
the defendant did not get the trial to which he was entitled.
The prosecutor made some remark that was wrong, a statement
was Introduced against him which was not reliably probative, or

9
some other reason.

And so, heretofore, it seems to me we have

a great unrecognized quantum difference between a reversal for
procedural error, such as, even in Bryan, the two cases it
cited involved those type of cases.

We have a quantum

difference —
QUESTION:
error, generally?

By procedural error, do you mean trial
Trial error, as distinguished from an in­

sufficiency of the evidence.
MR. .OURHAM:

Yes, sir.

I mean any other error other

than just failure of the state to sufficiently -~
QUESTION:
MR, OURHAM:
QUESTION:

Would there be any other categories —
I am sorry.
Are there any other kinds of errors that

could be raised on appeal, other than either errors in the
trial or insufficient evidence to support the verdict?
MR, OURHAM:
QUESTION:
MR, OURHAM:

No, sir.
How about defective indictment?
Yes, sir, a pretrial error, sir,

defective indictment, statute of limitations, seme of those
errors,
QUESTION:
MR. DURHAM:
QUESTION:
MR. DURHAM:

-defective grand jury?
Yes, sir.
oo there could be pretrial errors?
Yes, sir.

In one category, I think, we

put all errors involving sufficiency of the evidence, and in

10

Box B we put everything else*

And I think it is readily

ascertainable the^quantum difference between the two*
Now, as I said, this Court has never given, as far as
I know, plenary consideration, or even discussed that differ­
ence until today.

Some of the arguments in favor of granting

acquittals after insufficient evidence have to do with the
disparity of treatment which the same defendant might receive.
For example, other trial courts ~~ Let's assume the evidence
is insufficient to support the verdict.

Trial Court A might

affirm as we've heard here in the case in Florida.

Another

judge sitting might grant the new trial on the same proof.
And also other appellate courts, two different panels of
appellate courts might grant acquittal.

In the Sixth Circuit,

in the case I!ve cited in my brief, Rosenbarger, the Court of
Appeals, one panel sent the case back a few years ago, ordered
a judgment of acquittal.

In the present case before you today,

they sent it back for a new trial.
And then you have different standards.

The case

v^as sent back today under a Fifth Circuit stardard.

In other

instances, the standard has been, rather than what's just and
appropriate, sometimes they have -- like in the Wiley case or
some of the other cases that have been mentioned — they have
been sent back as to the prosecution was unfairly prevented
from bringing evidence.
Bo one has cases either being sent back or not sent

11
back and of those that are sent back, then we have different
standards for that,

so we almost have a lawless -- as

Mr# Justice Stevens pointed out

his question suggested to

me in many ways we have a lawless system of appellate review.

We are standardless.
Furthermore, there is the argument that the idea of
allowing the Government two bites of the apple in instances of
insufficient evidence condones and perpetuates careless
prosecutorial trial and preparation#

And I believe that a fair

reading of the record would show that that is true in this
instance.
In this instance, it seems egregious.

Number one,

there was a plea -of not guilty, quote, "by reason of insanity,"
close quote, in minute entry, and orally in court.
were advised at arraignment what it would be.

So they

Number two,

the judge's order to determine competency set out the three
rules of Smith.

Number three, the defense at trial, of course,

had to raise the issue of insanity first, and they asked every
witness.

They went right down the Smith rule in the Sixth

Circuit,..

Furthermore, the record shows we had large charts

and which we asked each witness, "What's your answer to
Question 1, Question 2 and Question 3?'

And lastly, the court

in Its charge to the jury followed that.
The Smith case, as I say, was decided in 1968.
Two

dmith

which went into and amplified Smith One, which was the same

12

defendant back on a retrial, on a subsequent appeal, after a
retrial, went into the question cf the quantum of proof, or
what was the evidentiary value of lay witnesses,
1 think that this is an instance.

We are not sug­

gesting that the prosecutor has to bam, bam, bam, one, two,
three, ask the ALI questions or Smith and Ninth Circuit
questions, but he's got to some way elicit the ultimate facts
of that*

He failed to do that.

He used the type of witnesses

who the Sixth Circuit had already told him did not have proper
credentialsc

In that 1970 opinion, they said someone who just

sees the crime for a few minutes, and went on to describe the
witnesses that the Government used, that those type of people
don't have sufficient knowledge for the trier of fact to reach
the u11ima t e Issue.
Society, of course, should fear,- In the Tateo case
and the Wilson case decided a term or two ago by this Court,
is urged a balancing of the equities.

But thc-tfs not the

instance in Insufficient evidence cases.

You know, society

should fear -the release of a defendant acquitted on a procedure],
error, because we make a judgment there that it's better,
perhaps, to uphold the principle to let one man go for that
reason than it is bo insist upon a conviction.

One of the

striking examples of that, of course, is this Court's opinion
not long ago, perhaps last term, in a case out of Arizona where
the defendant had murdered a child and had given a confession

13

to the police officer driving back,

A decision was made that

it was better that that be suppressed and perhaps that defendant
may have been ultimately released, as a societal balancing of
the interests.

But that's not true in the present case because,

as I said- we have no, interest in keeping a man where the
evidence was insufficient to convict him.

Forget the Bauble

Jeopardy Clause and all it means for a moment.

Society has no

interest where a court of appeals has looked at the proof,
everything there, and has found that the Government has net
made a ease against the man.
Furthermore, there is no difference between raising
the issue of insufficient evidence at trial and on appeal.

I

think this really would conserve judicial energy, in that
sometimes trial judges may let cases go on appeal thinking
that the appellate court might sort ail this out.

But the

defense counsel and trial lawyers should perhaps be more
diligent in doing that.
Now, injustice can be exacerbated when the defendant
cannot make bond.

In the present case, for example, the

defendant has not made bond.
QUESTION:

And in many other cases

What do you think underlies the Federal

Rule that you disagree with?

What kind of a policy or judgment

underlies or justifies the Federal Rule, barring other things
have?
MR» DURHAM:

If you restrict it to retrial for

14

insufficiency of evidence* I think one can make an argument
that appellate courts get feel that this man is probably guilty
and that it is in the interest* without any varying enunciated
criteria* they get a feeling that he should be retried,
QUESTION:

Do you think the Federal Rule is

representative of most state practices* or do you know?
MR, DURHAM:

I think that in most practices that

historically there has been no differentiation betvjeen
just as in the Federal courts — between reversals for
procedural* as opposed to reverses for insufficiency of the
evidence,
QUESTION:

Do you are suggesting that we* on a

constitutional basis* invalidate a rather wide majority of
state rules, too?
MR, DURHAM:

I cl on1 t think that it has ever been

considered and it comes up that often* but it's — I would
urge this Court rule on a constitutional basis* firstly* and
secondly* I would urge it rule on the statutory basis and
its supervisory powers over the lower Federal courts, under
the facts of this case* under Section 2106,
Society has no interest in re-trying no evidence
cases,

The time that is used. —
QUESTION:

By statutory basis, you mean a holding

that this was an abuse,

of discretion to say that this■ was

an appropriate order of the Court of Appeals and the facts

15

of the situation here} is that it?
MR* DURHAM:

Yes, sir.

I think you could look at

the Sixth Circuit and say they've done two or three different
things with different cases, the Rosenbarger case cited in ray
brief and this case.

One they acquitted and one they did not.

I cite an Illinois case from

an Illinois Bar Journal article

in which the commentator makes the point that in a rape case
out of Illinois two men,two separate times, committed rape.
One didn’t match up to the corroborative rule., the other did.
Bo they sent one back for a re-trial and they acquitted one.
QUESTION:

Are you making essentially the same

argument that was made in the preceding case which you heard
that confronted with this situation an appellate court has
just two choices, affirm or reverse,and that there are no other
alternatives?
MR. DURHAM;

Yes, sir.

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Easterbrook„

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK H. EASTERBROCK, ESQ.,
FOR THE RES POND ENT. ’
MR. EAUTERBROQK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
At least since 1896, when United States v. Ball was
decided, it has been settled that the Double Jeopardy Clause
imposes no limitations on the power to re-try a defendant who,
after being convicted at trial, succeeds in having his

16

conviction set aside.

The principle is as old as the Double

Jeopardy Clause and this Court applied it in the Bryan case,,
two reversals for insufficient evidence.

Bryan squarely

controls this case, and in our view the open question is
whether and to what extent Bryan should be reexamined.
Petitioner here, like Petitioner in the preceding
case, invokes a syllogism.

It runs like this:

One, if the

evidence is Insufficient to support a conviction, the court
should grant a judgment of acquittal without submitting the
case to the jury.

Two, if the trial judge grants such a

judgment of acquittal, the Double Jeopardy Clause bars a
second trial.

Three, a reversal on appeal because of in­

sufficient evidence amounts to a determination by the Court
of Appeals that the trial judge should have granted that
motion.

Four, since what should have been done ought to be

treated as if it had been done, this case should be treated as
if the judge had granted the judgment of acquittal and the
Double Jeopardy Clause, therefore, bars another trial.
QUESTION:

You agree with the soundness of the

first three premises but not with the conclusion, is that it?
MR* EASTERBROOK:

We have in the past taken issue

v-iith the soundness of that premise.
Martin Linen.

We took issue with it in

Mr. Justice Rehnquist argued in the Lee case

that a decision by the judge should be treated the same as a
dismissal of the indictment, but that's been settled by Martin

17
Linen,
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. EALTERBROOK:

For the purpose of this case3 we

take Issue with the conclusion and the part of the fourth
premise that Is a conclusion, rather than a -QUESTION:

And not with the first three premises.

MR» EASTERBROOK:

That'S right.

VJe think the syllogism suffers from excessive
attention to form.

The rule that an acquittal ty the judge

is final and that the Louble Jeopardy Clause bars a second
trial is justified as a means to protect the ability of the
defendant to receive a verdict of the jury and to protect his
interest in an acquittal that he actually obtains.

But it

requires a leap to say that a person who was not acquitted at
trial deserves the same treatment,

This case does not require

speculation about what a jury would have done if given the
chance.

It was given the chance and it returned the verdict of

guilty.

This case does not involve the defendant's interest in

preserving a disposition in his-: favor.
QUESTION:

Jo you think this case, involving as it

does the v/eighfc of the evidence on his criminal responsibility,,
is any different from the weight of the evidence on presence
at the scene of the crime or any other element of the crime?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

VJe believe It is. Your Honor,

This is a case in which the prosecutor presented a prlma facie

18

case that the defendant robbed the bank and, Indeed, on appeal
the defendant conceded that he robbed the bank.

All of the

testimony that his psychiatrist gave explained why he robbed the
bank, what Internal compulsion drove him to become a bank robber.
We believe, for that reason, this case falls well within the
argument of Tateo that there is a category of cases In which
the public has an interest in avoiding seeing those who are
actually guilty of crime go free because of an error made at
trial.
QUESTION:

Tateo was during the trial, wasn't it?

MR. EASTERBROOK:

Yes, Your Honor, it was.

Defendant

pleaded guilty during the trial of Tateo.
QUESTION:

A person who is insane cannot be guilty

of a crime.
MR. EASTERBROOK:

That's true and in that sense

ultimately sanity is known to the offense, so —

MR, EAETERBROGK:
QUESTION:

I agree with that.

On what basis do you agree?

Is it a

statutory matter or a common law matter, constitutional?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

It's a common law matter in the

19

Federal courts.

The decision of this Court in the Davis, case

was that as a matter of Federal common law sanity is part of
the offense.

But in Federal cases, the usual order of proof

is proof of the commission of the offense, then the defendant6s
proof of sanity, of insanity, then the prosecutor's ~~
QUESTION:

Then you still stand on your response to

my prior question, that there is a difference?
MR» SAST.BRB.RQOK:
purposes, Mr» Chief Justice,

There is at least for constitutional
The Court held :.n Leland v,

Oregon that as a constitutional matter sanity need not be part
of the offense and that the defendant can be required to prove
lack of sanity.

For that purpose, there is a difference between

those elements of the offense that the Constitution requires to
be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and that includes the fact
that Petitioner robbed a bank, and those elements that the
Constitution does not require to be so proven, end that the
defendant, indeed, could be required constitutionally to
prove,
QUESTION:

Burden of proof is something else.

I

think you've already said, but let me be sure that I understand
it, that you would concede, would you not, that an insane
person cannot be guilty of a criminal offense if he's insane
at the time of the conduct which on the part of a sane person
would be a criminal offense?
MR. BAfcTERBROOK:

Yes, Your Honor, but my answer to

20

the Chief Justice's question may be more easily understood once
I've established some of the premises of my argument, and I
would like to turn back in that direction.
I was trying to discuss the reasons why an actual
acquittal at trial has been thought to deserve a special rule of
finality.

My point then was that Petitioner was actually not

acquitted at trial, he had no interest in that sort of finality
that he was seeking to preserve.

In fact, this is a case in

which the judge and all twelve jurors concluded that sanity
had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt on the evidence that
they heard.

Petitioner's argument rests on a form of symmetry.

"If I had been acquitted, I couldn't be re-tried,

since I

should have been acquitted, I shouldn't be re-tried."

But the

argument from symmetry is weak because it slights the reasons
for giving special force to an acquittal that actually took
place, and it slights the rule that reversals on appeal of a
conviction at trial always have been treated differently.
It is hard to see why a non-obvious defect in the evidence,
a defect so subtle that it was missed by the prosecutor, by
the judge and by all twelve jurors, should confer automatic
immunity from prosecution.
QUESTION:

But this case didn't say any — This case

said insufficiency of evidence, and that's not like forgetting
to show that the man was eight years old.
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Your Honor, the Court of Appeals

did say that the evidence was insufficient.
QUESTION:

No,

They did more than that.

That was

the basis of the ruling, wasn't it?
MR. EASTEKBROGK:
QUESTION:

I am sorry, Your Honor.

Wasn't that the basis of the ruling, of

their ruling?
MR* EASTERBRQOK:

The decision of the Court of

Appeals was that the evidence of sanity was insufficient.
It is some tines necessary, we think, in cases like this, to
determine what the court meant by that.

As Judge Leventha 1

said in the Wiley case on which we have relied heavily in our
brief, Courts of Appeals sometimes use evidence, use language
of insufficiency when they mean something else.

The Court of

Appeals might have meant two somethings else in this case.
The first something else it might have meant was that the
prosecutor should have asked his expert witnesses, point blank,
the question whether the defendant was substantially capable
of conforming his conduct to the requirements of the law. And
not having asked that question, point blank, and gotten an
answer, he hadn't put on a form of evidence that the Court of
Appeals wants in insanity cases.

But that might not mean that

the jury was proscribed from inferring from the other things
those psychiatrists said, how they would have answered that
question if it had been asked .
QUESTION:

Mr» Easterbrook, under the Glasser rule,

22

shouldn’t the evidence have been taken most favorably to support
the verdict and, therefore, wouldn't the Appellate Court have
a duty to assume that the jury did make the inference, if that
was a permissible inference?
MRi,. iSAc.TSRBROOK:•

I think, Mr, Justice Stevens, that the

evidence should have been so taken, and indeed there is a strong
argument that the Court of Appeals, in this case, was wrong
in its evaluation of the evidence, precisely because —
QUESTION:

But you didn't cross petition, so --

MR, BA^TERBROQK:

We did not cross petition and we

did not raise it as an argument in support of the judgment,
QUESTION:

Oon't we have to take the case as though

the Court of Appeals held the evidence was insufficient?
MR, EAETERBROQK:

1 understand that we do.

My point

in making this point was that, even taking the case that way,
there are many varieties of insufficiency of the evidence.

It

comes in different shapes and colors, and it is not all the
same as if the prosecutor for an unexplained reason had simply
neglected to prove that the defendant robbed the bank.
The only way to put this, I think ~~
QUESTION:

I don't really understand your example,

because if we assume, in accordance with Glasser, that the jury
d5.d draw all the inferences favorable to the Government that
it could have drawn, and the Court of Appeals nevertheless
found the evidence insufficient, why is this different from the

last case, for example?
MR* EAPTERBRQOK:
different way.

I might try the answer in a slightly

Wherever you draw the line between sufficiency

of the evidence and insufficiency of the evidence, some cases
are going to be very close to that line on either side.

The

Court of Appeals is confronted with a very difficult question
when it gets that Rind of case,

If it has two alternatives and

two alternatives only, reversing the conviction outright and
discharging the defendant on the one hand, and affirming the
conviction outright on the other hand, it may be influenced in
making its decision, as the Court said in Tateo, by the fact
that it believes that there has been a prima facie case of
guilt and that the technical insufficiency of the evidence is
really not enough to bar a conviction of someone who in the
Court’s view is actually guilty.

If it views the case that

way, it may be inclined to err on the side of affirmance.
it has only two options.
QUESTION:

It would have the duty to—

How can you say, then, it is erring on

the side of affirmance?

Just performing its duty, isn’t it?

MR* EASTJEHBROCK:
doubt.

If

The question is how it resolves

There is doubt in many of these cases, end some rules

are necessary for resolving them,
QURdTION:

This is on direct appeal*

MR. BASTiSRBROOK:

On direct appeal.

If it ends up resolving doubt in those kinds of cases

24

In favor of affirmance, it is a rule that is probably not
beneficial for defendants as a group,
QUESTION:

But isn’t it beneficial for inquiry for

us, whether the rule is in the long run going to be helpful
or harmful?
MR» EAUTKRBRQOK:

One of the concerns, one that X

think is important, is how the Court of Appeals is going to
deal with the cases in which it has substantial doubt, in which
it finds itself on the razor's edge between conviction and
outright dismissal of the charges.
The point I was trying to make is that a remand for
a second trial in that class of cases offers the Court of
Appeals, and defendants as a group, an attractive option that
avoids the great dilemma that it might otherwise be in,
QUESTION:
attractive option?

Why is it sc clear that that's an
If you remand in doubtful cases, you put

society to the expense of a second trial which, really, may be
unnecessary and you may put both parties to the burden of
another trial and you may also let a guilty man go free.

There

are two sides to all these arguments, it seems to me,
MR, EASTEKBRQQK:

I agree that the.re are»

I am not

suggesting that the Court should resolve them in a particular
way in a particular case.

One of the

I was using this as

an argument to show that in some cases that kind of disposition
is a proper one and, indeed, perhaps, the best one, fairly

25

reflecting the inability to decide whether the evidence
technically described under the Glasser standard is sufficient.
We have not argued* on the other hand, for a uniform rule that
such cases should go back for a second trial.

Our argument has

been that the Court of Appeals ought to ask a number of Ques­
tions.

The first is:

Whether the evidence that it thought

was missing could be supplied at the second
question is:

Whether

supplied at the first

trial? The second

there was some reason that it was not
trial?

The nature of that reason may be

very important.
QUESTION:

Is this still on direct appeal?

MR. EAJTERBROOK:

dtil1 on direct appea1.

The nature of the reason why it was not supplied •»Excuse me — Let me get back to your question. Mr. Justice
Relinquis t,
I was not suggesting that the Court of Appeals would,
itself, address those questions.
QUESTION:

You say your opponent's argument is a

triumph of form over substance,

I am inclined to think yours

is a triumph of substance ever form, if you are going to have
every one of these an ad hcc determination by the trial judge
as to whether eighteen factors have been met or not.

This is

a rule that has to be applied by 400 Federal trial judges and
thousands of state court judges.

It has to have some black and

white line-drawing character to it.

26

ME. EASTERBROCK:

I think it is difficult,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, to have a clear-cut line in cases like
this.
QUESTION:

Well, your brief certainly revealed your

feelings to that effect.
MR, EAETERBROOK:

One reason for that is because we

were starting — at least 1 was starting here almost by
hypothesis with the class of cases in which it is difficult to
.make a decision under the Glasser, standard.

But there are a

variety of other cases, I think, in which it is also difficult
to make a decision.

Those are the classes of cases in which

you'can’t tell whether the error is legal or simple inability
to prove the offense.

There are many cases in which there has

been a reversal which purportedly is for insufficient evidence
that may have other things underpinning it,
QUESTION:

That's because the Court — If I am

trapping you — That's because the Court had some other
handles to grasp, that is an attack on the conviction that ’was
based on trial errors or protrial errors and Insufficenc-y of
the evidence, and by singling cn one of the trial errors the
double jeopardy problem is .avoided.

But we can't rely on any

such distinctions here, can we?
MR. EASTER.ROCK:

We can't rely cn any pretrial

errors- here, hut what I was suggesting and, indeed, suggested
in response to one of the early questions,

was that this may

27

be a ease in which it is hard to tell legal rules and factual
insufficiency apart, to the extent the Court of Appeals is
saying that it believes that the right way to try an insanity
case is to ask the point-blank question:

Was the defendant

substantially capable of conforming his conduct?
QUESTION:

Except that this Court, something in the

neighborhood of 60 years ago, said that's precisely what you
cannot do, that's the question for the jury and the questions
at the trial must be directed at furnishing all the bits and
pieces from which the jury can draw that inference.
in the disability case where the question was:

That was

"Doctor, in

your opinion, is the Plaintiff totally and permanently dis­
abled?1'

And this Court said you can't ask that kind of a

question»
MR. iSASTEKBROCK:

The Court said that, Mr. Chief

Justice, but that decision has been reversed by Federal Rule
of Evidence 704 which provides, which was intended —
QUESTION:

Under our new Rules of Evidence.

talking about the case law.

I am

You were addressing yourself to

that.
MR. EACTERBRQQK:

My point was that there was, at

least until the time the Sixth Circuit decided this case, an
open question of law in that court about whether those ques­
tions in addition to being permissible were also mandatory.
The Court of Appeals now seems to have decided that they are

28

mandatory.

But that, ultimately, is a legal decision and can

be described as either a mistake of law on the part of the
prosecutor in not having recognized that before trial, or as
a failure of proof,

I think there are a lot of other examples

of that,
For example, suppose hearsay evidence is admitted
and the Court of Appeals then concludes that,, disregarding the
improperly admitted hearsay, what*s left is insufficient.

Is

that insufficiency of the evidence or error In admitting the
hearsay?

Suppose the District Court misunderstands some of

the elements of the offense and calls on the prosecutor to
prove fewer than all of them.

Or take a claim of variance

between the charge and the proof which comes up especially
often in conspiracy cases.

That can be seen either as too

little proof of, the particular conspiracy charged in the
indictment, or too much proof of other conspiracies.

Suppose

the prosecutor proves an offense but not the one charged in
the indictment4

Is that too little proof or proof of something

else?
The examples can go on and on.

Critical evidence

can be suppressed in raid-trial on Fourth Amendment grounds
and what*3 left is insufficient.

The suppression may be

erroneous, raising purely illegal questions,

liven the

questions the prosecutor asks —
QUESTION:

Let me just test yo&r example about the

29
multiple conspiracy versus the single conspiracy -~
Your saying the trial judge could either hold, could either
conclude there was not enough evidence to prove the particular
conspiracy charge or, alternatively» he could hold that there
was prejudicial evidence of a lot of other conspiracies.
MR, EASTBRBROOKs
QUESTION:

Or he may hold both at once»

Well, if he holds the former, why isn't

-- why doesn’o that entitle the defendant to an acquittal?
And if he holds the latter, it’s clear he is entitled to a new
trial»

Why is that such a complicated case?
MR» EAETERBROOK:

The decision of the judge may be

-- I think you were phrasing them as alternatives
the judge often does both at once.

I believe

He says you prove two

conspiracies, not one»
OU-uoTION:

But if he is charged with one and the one

charge has not been proved, why should not the man go free
simply because an additional error was committed. Isn't that
%

what you are saying?
MR, EAhTBRBRQGK:

The judge’s responsibility in that

case may be to grant a judgment of acquittal, bit suppose he
doesn't?

The question is then what happens?
QUESTION:

The hypothesis in all of your hypothetical

cases, I assume that the trial judge whatever he should have
done, didn't do it, and it was up to the jury and there was
a conviction and now we are on appeal.

Those are your

30

hypothetica is.
MR, EAST ORB ROOK:
QUESTION:

Those are all ray hypothetica Is,

Nothing would happen in that trial court

except a conviction. On appeal, the appellate court was able
to identify the error it fas decided required reversal.

And if

it identified it as a failure of proof, one could say without
terrible difficulty, that requires acquittal.

If he determines

that it was prejudice, because other conspiracies are proved,
it would follow a new trial.

It is just a matter of deciding

the Issues.
MR, EAETURB.ROQK:

I think s cm times it is hard to say

whether it requires an acquittal*

Perhaps the appellate court

could conclude with equal accuracy there was really a defect
In the framing of the indictment and that what should have
happened is the judge should have mistried the case, rather
than acquit him.
QUESTION:

Then you have the Ball case.

That fits

right into a neat category, too, doesn’t it?
MR, EASTERBROQK:

Sometimes it is hard to fit them

into neat categories.
QUESTION:

A lot of appellate decisions are very,

very difficult, but that doesn't mean we dispense with rules,
does it?
MRo EA&TKKBRO@K:
with rules,

I am not suggesting we dispense

I think we have suggested one.

But let me try

31
once more with the Forman case.

One that fits in fairly clearly

to your hypothetical, with the added wrinkle that the district
judge was wrong,

Defendant is charged with income tax ivasion,

was charged about six years after the return was due to be filed.
His contention is that he can't be convicted unless the prose­
cution proves a subsidiary conspiracy to conceal, because that
is the only thing within the statute of limitation.

The

district judge agrees with him wholeheartedly and charges the
jury on a subsidiary conspiracy to conceal argument, a charge
that this Court determined in Gruenwald was erroneous.

There

was, it turns out, absolutely no evidence to support that
charge.

If the judge had believed his own legal conclusion,

he should have acquitted®

If the jury had believed the

judge's charge, it should have acquitted.
The jury convicted.

Neither happened«

The Court of Appeals then sent the case

back for a new trial under the proper instructions.

The

Defendant's argument was that his right to be acquitted
matured at trial and he should have been acquitted.

And this

Court's answer was that it didn't make any difference what
should have happened at'trial, the fact is that he wasn't
acquitted.

He was convicted,

So his interest in preserving

acquittal which never took place simply never came into being.
QUii-TION:

kith a Sufficiency of evidence case,

isn't there a fundamental distinction between reviewing on
sufficiency of the evidence and reviewing for all other

32

purposes?
•MR. KASTEKBRQQK:
is an important distinction.

Mr, Chief Justice, I think there
The distinction arises because

the double Jeopardy Clause vjas designed in part to prevent the
prosecutor from making repeated atterupts to assemble and intro­
duce enough evidence to convict a defendant.

Defendant has an

important interest in avoiding multiple trials where the only
difference between one trial and another is the ability or
willingness of the prosecutor to introduce probative evidence.
But we have submitted that that interest is not enough to
prevent a second trial in every event where you might charac­
terize the defect in the first trial as insufficient evidence.
Petitioner here, after ail, was not acquitted or deprived of
his opportunity to be acquitted.

He was convicted.

Allowing second trials does not provide an incentive
for prosecutorial misconduct or overreaching.

It would be an

exceptional, foolhardy prosecutor who intentionally failed to
introduce enough evidence at the first trial, hoping that in
the teeth of the lack of evidence the jury would convict,
the Court of Appeals would reverse, and he would have the
opportunity to vex the defendant with a second trial.
would be extraordinary.

It

It doesn9t happen.

The legitimate interests of the defendant do deserve
recognition.

But they were properly recognized here by the

nature of the Court of Appeals remand,

This case was not'

33
remanded mechanically to hold a second trial,

It ivas remanded

to determine why the evidence was insufficient in the first
trial.

To determine, that is, whether this was a simple

failure of the prosecutor to put on evidence that he had, or
a simple inability to assemble the evidence, or whether it
wasn't, instead, something more.
We think the ends of public justice in a particular
case should be the guiding star, whether under the Double
jeopardy Clause or under section 2106,

A second trial is»

just and appropriate if the first trial was defective because
of a mistake of law,

whether or net that mistake ultimately

displayed itself in the insufficiency of the evidence.

Mistakes

of law are too common to permit them to immunize defendants
from prosecution, and the interest in accurate resolution of
criminal charges outweighs the defendant's interest in uniformly
avoiding a second trial.
When the evidence is truly insufficient because of
prosecutorial neglect or inability to prove the offense, we
think that the presumption should be against a second trial,
A second trial would be appropriate if, first, it appears that
the evidence can be supplied at a second trial.
QUESTION:

Are you speaking of just that the Federal

Rule should be under the statute .or are you talking about a
c ons t it u t i ona 1 rule?
MR, DASTEKBROQK:

We believe that the statutory rule

34
and the constitutional rule should not be any different, Your
Honor,

That's in part because the Court has said in Jorn and

Tat£o that the interests of justice determine the constitutional
propriety of the second trial, that it’s really often a
balancing test.
QUESTION:

So that the constitutional rule should be

that if the Appellate Court finds that the evidence was in­
sufficient and there doesn't appear to be any real excuse for
it, that the Constitution requires an acquittal.
MR, EABTERBROOK:

I believe that that is the correct

QUESTION:
made?

Whereabout is this ultimate determination

When the nan is brought for trial the second time in

the district court or the superior court,or whatever the next
highest court is?

MR, EASTKRBRQOK:

We have not expressed an opinion

on that, in part because that’s probably most appropriately
determined by the Courts of Appeals in the exercise of their
supervisory power to determine where it is most appropriately
«CS»

QUESTION:

Well, what about the 50 state jurisdic­

tions that are going to be affected by your argument?
MR, EASTDRBROCK:

I think, too, that those .states

should have the authority to determine where this kind of
determination ought to be made.

35
QUESTION:

But at any rate you are turning some

thousands of nis1 pious judges loose to make this ad hoc
determination that — balancing of factors that come out one
way in one case and another way, presumably, in a very, very
similar case,
MR, BABTERBRQOK:
is not entirely ad hoc.

Mr. Justice Rehnquisfc, we hope it

It is certainly no more ad hoe than

finding when, after a mistrial has been declared, there was
manifest necessity to do so.
QUESTION;

Well, why compound one sin with another?

MR. EASTERBRQQK:

We haven *t taken the view that one

of those manifest necessity arguments was a sin.
QUESTION:

Mr*, hast orb rook, the Court of Appeals of

the Eixth Circuit, in this case, ended up by adopting the
standards and procedure prescribed by the Fifth Circuit in
Bass, in its concise statement of those standards in its opinion,
Are those standards acceptable to and compatible with the
position you are arguing here today?.
MR» .CABTERBROQK:

We believe that they are. Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

It ‘would seem to me that what you've said

on pages 37 and 33 of your brief was somewhat more complex.
Two basic inquires would be made by the District Court on
remand under the Bass standard.

First of all, was there

additional evidence that would be relevant to a verdict?

And,

36
secondly, whether or not there had been some prosecutorial
default in not having presented that evidence at the appropriate;
time.

Now, those two standards would not be too difficult, in

my view, for lower courts to apply.

I am thinking of the

question that Mr. Justice Rehnquist has asked you.
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Your Honor, we don't believe they

would be too difficult to apply.

I think we were attempting in

our brief to take very much the same position and to restate
it,

The position we stated was whether there was some reason

why it didn’t come in at the first trial.

That’s very much the

same as asking whether it was prosecutorial neglect or default,
or whether it had some other cause, perhaps a misunderstanding
of law or something other than simple default,

I think the

standards v/e have outlined in our brief are the same as the
Bass standards.

I think they are the same

QUESTION:

Is that the Bass case in 4S;0 Federal

S ec ond ?
MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTIONi

Yes.

That’s in the Fifth Circuit.

MR, EASTERBROOK:

Right.

The standards that were

adopted here.
The Court of Appeals remanded this case to allow the
district Court to make those inquiries.

Petitioner will not be

tried a second time unless the prosecutor can persuade the
District Court that he has the evidence the Court of Appeals

37
found wanting and that the reason it was not offered was some­
thing other than prosecutorial neglect or default.

There la

no reason to forbid the district court from making those
inquiries.
QUESTION;

Does that not open a whole new area of

appellate review up to now avoided by appellate courts
everywhere?
MR. EASTERBRQOK:

I don't think it does, Your Honor.

Appellate courts now are by and large making the decision
whether to send it back for a new trial, whether to acquit
outright or whether to ask the district court t,o make that
decision.

Under 2106, the court of appeals has the undoubted

power simply to order the defendant acquitted and to stop it
there.

Since it has that power, it must have some grounds for

deciding when to do that and when to do something else.
asks that question now in every case.

It

And we think that the

standards we have suggested for asking that question are more
helpful to the courts and certainly do not require it to
embark on any inquiry that they are not now making.
Thank -you, very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further, counselor?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT CP BART C. DURHAM, III, EoQ,.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR* DURHAM:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

38
the Court:
I want to give Mr. Chief Justice a better answer to
the last question that he asked me.

The question was did I

see any alternative between an acquittal and a new trial.

I

suppose that I would not argue for an absolute rule here.

I

think you might find exceptions.

The Solicitor General has

pointed out some with which I might agree.

Some he has pointed

out have been where the defendant., himself, prevented the
Government from going forward.

For example, in the Smith One

case, in 1968 in the Sixth Circuit, the defendant in mid­
trial interposed insanity defense but he wouldn't take it
himself and he wouldn't allow a recess, wouldn't submit to an
examination, and the Sixth Circuit said that was his own fault
and he shouldn't profit.

Of course, that’s a well known

principle of law.
Counsel for the United .'.states brought up another
exception,

a changing presumption or inference that district

court might not be aware of, or variance between pleading and
the proof.

In some of those, this Court, I don't think, is

absolutely required in order to decide this case to render
such an absolutist opinion.

The contours of this decision

might well be left to a later date.

But the facts of this

case, I think, are such that we are not going anyivhere near the
limits that he urges.
Lastly, Mr. Justice Powell mentioned the Bass rule

39
and I've mentioned the Smith in the Sixth Circuit.

Strangely

enough, the Sixth Circuit in this case adopted the Bass rule
In the Fifth Circuit.

But now, as I read the Bass case, that

sends it back for a vague balancing of the equities, but the
language Bass used is "see If the Government's got any more
evidence they want to use."

Well, we don't want that.

We want

what they did in 1968 in the Sixth Circuit, What she .sixth
Circuit has done before is see if the Government's got a good
/
reason why they didn't use the evidence, not only if they've
just got more evidence, but A, if they've got mere evidence and
B, is there is some good reason why they didn't do that,

«bo,

we certainly don't agree with the Bass decision at all.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 2:32 o'clock, p.m, the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted„)
