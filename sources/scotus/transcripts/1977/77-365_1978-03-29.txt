MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We*11 hear arguments next

in. United States against LaSalle National Bank.
Mr. Wallace,

you may proceed whenever you're ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WALLACE|j

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas®

the Court:
This is an Internal Revenue summons enforcement pro­
ceeding, in which the district court denied enforcement and
the Court of Appeals affirmed.
The case presents questions that many of us thought
were settled by this Court's decisions in United States v.
Powell in 1964, an,d Donaldson v. United .States in 1971? but
the questions have stubbornly persisted.
The Special Agent in this case served a summons on
the respondents, a

bank and its vice president, seeking

information involving real estate trusts relating to the
affairs of a parti.cular taxpayer who was the subject of his
investigation.

And, incidentally, the record shows that the

taxpayer's attorney has been the counsel for the respondents
throughout 'the case.
Nov/, the Special Agent's testimony in response to the
purpose of the issuance of the summons, in direct response to
questions, said that the purpose of his investigati.on was to

4
determina tax liabilities for th© years under laves taxation»
And wh©n asked what the focus of his own inquiry into the matter
was, he said it was to investigate the possibility of criminal
violations of the Internal Revenue Cod©.
The Court of Appeals characterized this testimony as
indicating teat th® record established that tea Special Agent
testified to th© existence of

a

civil purpose, but that th©

district court, who observed the demeanor of th© witness,
discredited teat testimony.
Now, while it is not material to the position that
we9re taking in the case, I do think it’s illustrative of the
problems we're running into in these cases, that,with all
respect, I find it hard, myself, to characterize tee holding
of tee district court this way.

What the district court —

there was no contradictory testimony of any kind, the district
court was relying, in its findings, solely on the testimony
of the Agent with respect to the functions that he was carrying
out.

And the findings recited by the district court seem to

me to be wholly consistent with th© Agent's testimony.
And that is in the Appendix to the Petition, referring
to th© district court's opinion, at the bottom of page 2a of
the Appendix to th® Petition and th© top of page 3a? th©
district court said;
"It is apparent, however, teat this focus and
determination'9

namely, teat it's an investigation for a

5

criminal purpose ~ "may be arrived at, under certain circumstances- before the actual recommendation for criminal prose­
cution has been made»

In such event the focus and determina­

tion has been arrived at at the time of the issuance of the
Internal Revenue summons."
And in the district court’s view that becomes a
summons issued for improper purpose that should not b© enforced,
And that was reflected by the testimony, where the Agent said,
while tlie purpose of his investigation was to determine tax
liabilities, the focus of his inquiry, all consistent with
the language used by the district court, was to inv@sti.gat®
whether there had been a criminal violation of the tax laws.
The difficulty that we're finding in these summons
enforcement proceedings -*•
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, before you leave Judge McGarr's

opinion, it does say in the next-to-last paragraph that it's
apparant that th® Agent was "conducting his investigation
solely for the purpose of unearthing evidence of criminal
conduct."
MR. WALLACE; That is correct.
=V.

QUESTION; So then w© accept that as — that's what
the Court of Appeals said h© found, too, isn't it?
the difference between Judge Pell and
MR. WALLACE;

What's

Judge McGarr?

Well, there's no indicati.on that there

was any rejection of any of th© witness's testimony on th©

6

basis of credibility by Judge McG&rr„
QUESTIONs Well, bo the extant that the witness said it was
for some? other purpose, when the district court says it's
solely for the purpose of criminal proceeding, then he’s
rejecting the other testimony.
MR. WALLACE;

Well, that was the test being used.

I recognize that one can characterize this 'the way the Court
of Appeals characterized it, but I find it difficult to find
an inconsistency bafafaea Judge McG&rr* s holding and th©
testimony.

And he doesn’t in any way reject th© testimony,

h© seems to be saying that so long as th© agent admits that
th© focus of his inquiry is on criminal aspects of the
investigation, that shows that there is a solely criminal
purpose for purposes of applying the standard that ha thinks
should b© applied under Donaldson.
This doesn’t —
QUESTION;
case?

Well, how do you expect us to decide the

Should we assume that the investigation was solely for

criminal purposes or not?
MR. WALLACE; Well, that’s what I’m trying to g©fe to,
if you’ll left m© do it with a little introductory.
QUESTION;

Just tell m@ yes or no and you gat to it

pretty fast.
MR. WALLACE;

There really — in the first place I

don’t think it’s the pertinent question, and in the second place

7
there is a© such investigation whan an. assignment has been
made to a Special Agent.

That's the short answer, but I'll

hav© to explain it a little bit indirectly»
The difficulty that we're running into in these
summons enforcement proceedings, in a number of Courts of
Appeals, that have departed from the line of demarcation, that
was at least one line clearly established in Donaldson, whether
a recommendation has been mad© by the Department of Justice;
and it instead adopted a standard of whether its sol® purpose
was a criminal purpose or whether the Agent had a firm purpose
to recommend prosecution or a fixed purpose to recommend
prosecution, is that the inquiry is focusing on the personal
purpose of the Agent and his subjective understanding of his
assignment rather than the .legal purpose of th© authorised
investigation that has been assigned to him.
An Agent does not select the subject of his investi­
gation.

In this case h® said he was assigned to investigate

the tax liabilities of this particular taxpayer.

That assign­

ment was duly made by what would have been 'die group manager
in a large office such as this on©; in a smaller office it
would ba mads by Mi© Chief of the Unit.
And our position is that so long as that assignment
is duly made, as a tax investigation assignment, and th© Agent
is carrying out that investigation, -there is no meaningful
distinction in th® Agent's functions between a civil and

8
criminal purpose of his inveshiga.ti on.

The fewo are not;

separable.
And the delay that we're running into in summons
enforcement proceedings is because the Agents are being called
to til© stand, cross-examined about their personal understanding
of fchair function, to see if, in some way, they will indicate,
sometimes in an appeal to their vanity, about the kind of
matters that call for bringing them into it, that this is
merely —
QUESTION: Well, Mr» Wallace, —
MR. WALLACE:

-— an investigation of criminal

conducto
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, w© do have a case here

involving a particular Agent and his —
MRo WALLACE:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

— particular investigation.

And Justice

Stevens asked you a while ago about whether, in view of Judge
McGarr's finding that the investigation was solely for
criminal purposes, in which he suggested that the Court of
Appeals had upheld as not clearly erroneous, what hypothesis
do ws go ahead on in this case?

And the table of organization

©f the IRS, I don®fc think is very helpful to answer that.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, I'll have to differ with you,

Mr. Justice, I think it makes all of the difference, because
both th© district court ahd the Court of Appeals proceeded on

9

th© erroneous premise that: th® test hers — and I’m referring
back to Judge McG&rr's opinion, page 2a of the Appendix to the
Petition, this was the next thing I was getting to ~ that
he said, in the first full paragraph on that

page:

“The Court recognizes that civil and criminal investi­
gations may go forward side by side before a determination of
th© ultimate focus of -the Investigation is made."

And that

is quoted virtually word for word by th© Court of Appeals on
page 8a, in apparant- agreement that that is th© starting point
of th© legal analysis her©.
But it is not —
QUESTIONi

Mr. Wallace, h© said that’s what may

happen, and later on he says what did happen in this case,
which is something different.
MR. WALLACES

What I’m trying to tell the Court is

that there's no such thing as a civil and criminal investiga­
tion going on side by side, in the way the Internal Revenue
Service proceeds.

It’s merely a matter of nomenclature whether

you say that th® Special Agent's assignment is to determine
whether fraud penalties should be assessed against the tax­
payer or whether th©r© have bean criminal violations of the
Internal Revenue Code.
QUESTION;

But would this Court not b® as free as

the Court of Appeals would hav© bean to say that, absent,
contrary testimony, some affirmative testimony pointed to by

10

th© district; judge, his finding on this subject was clearly
erroneous?

Is that not one of th© alternatives open?
MR, WALLACE:

It is an alternative open,, but I

think teat this is not a matter of the clearly erroneous find­
ing, this is a matter of an improper legal standard being
applied to the question of ©nforcabillfcy of an Internal
Revenue summons.
And I think that this is clarified very helpfully
for us by a recent analysis by tee Second Circuit Court of
Appeals, which we had set out in the Appendix to our Reply
Brief, an opinion written by Judge Friendly on behalf of teat
Court, in a case called United States v, Morgan Guaranty Trust,
And, as he points out at th® bottom of page 12a of the
Appendix to our Reply Briefs
"We start65 — and I think this is quits accurate —
"from the premise that investigations of taxpayers teat
would develop evidence of criminal but not of civil tax liabiliisy
must b® rare? indeed, petitioners have pointed to none,"
As we specify in our brief, when tax fraud is found,
teat is evidence that supports a determination teat a 50 per­
cent fraud penalty should be added to th® liability otherwise
due.

And th© Internal Revenue Cod© is quite specific that

teat kind of a fraud penalty is a tax within th© meaning of tee
Coda, that's Section 6659(a)(2) ©f th® Code, and that a
determination that a fraud penalty is «wing is a part of what

11
must: be specified in the: statutory notice of deficiency.
is the effect of Section 6671 of the Code»

That

And It’s the

statutory notice of deficiency that culminates from a tax
investigation undertaken by the Special Agent.
And there's no way that his —QUESTION!
MR. WALLACE:

Well, how did Judge McGarr rule wrong?
Dy not understanding that there's no

way to differentiate the civil and criminal aspects of the —
QUESTION: Did the government lawyer explain it to him?
MR. WALLACE;

He may not have sufficiently.

QUESTION: Well, if he didn't, what are we going to
do?

Are we going to say the judgment is wrong?
MR. WALLACE;

Well, that is the question presented

in our petition that was granted by this Court, and that is
the question that needs deciding, because the Courts of Appeals
are going in many disparate directions here, and many tax
investigations are going —
QUESTION:

Well, what are

you going to tell us,

to show that ha was wrong?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, that's the purpose of my argument.,

QUESTION: Well, Judge Friendly's opinion would have
had no trouble with Judge McGarr's finding, would it?
QUESTION:

That's right.

QUESTION:

It simply would have said, "I can accept

it as not clearly erroneous, and, nonetheless, they are not

12

????

entitled to that, to subpoena the court’s rights.”
MR. WALLACE:

That is correct.

should have been enforced.

Because the summons

That is exactly what the Second

Circuit would have held on the basis of Judge McG&rr’s
findings, which is why we’re here. Th© Circuits are not deciding
these cases in the same way, and wa’re h&vinq lengthy inquiries
of Special Agente that ultimately seem to us to have a much
deeper purpose.
QUESTIONS

Well, I know one thing ~~ it's not in

this record; but I know what you say wasn’t a rule in 1965. .
Because in a case in the Second Circuit there wer© two Agents
sitting in the same office, one in civil and on© in criminal,
on the sws man.

Has that changed?

MRe WALLACE:

There are Revenue Agents and

Special

Agents who specialis© in different aspects of the investigation..
The Revenue Agent, as — all this was recognized in the Court’s
Donaldson opinion, when it said thst the mere bringing in of
th© Special Agent does not convert it into an improper use of
tli© summons.

Th© Revenue Agant is a specialist in determining

liability other than th© 50 percent addition to tax, that is
th© fraud penalty; and the Special Agent is someone trained to
investigate for fraud and to see whether a 50 percent addition
to the tax liability should be made.

In other words, he has

one-third of the responsibility for determining th© possible
d@fici.ency in the tax payment.

13

And that: is specifically what; Secti.on 760 2 of the
Code authorises Agents of the Service to issue summonses for,
to determine tax liability, which, as X

just explained to the

Court, includes, ia the definitions of the Code, liability for
fraud penalties.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, let me just *— see if I

understand your position.

Isn't the government arguing that

even if Judge McGarr is 100 percent right, the investigation
really could b© characterized as 100 percent criminal.

Never­

theless, no recommendation for prosecution had been made,
therefor©, there's a pur© simple rule that we can apply under
some similar cas©j that's your argument, isn't it?
MR. WALLACE:

That is our position. That is

correct, but I would not quits characterize it that way,
because there is no such thing as a 100 percent criminal
in ‘this sense.
QUESTIONs Well, you can assume there is, and you'd
make the same argument, wouldn't you?
MR. WALLACE: Well, I can't assume that there is,
because it's unrealistic, it's not the purpose for which the
investigation was ~QUESTXOH:
it?

Well, it's theoretically possible, isn’t

That there could be an absolutely detailed determination

of tax liability, but some lacking, some shortage of evidence
on intent. And you’re looking for some corporat® minute or

14
something,

There could theoretically be such a case, and you'd

say you could still enforce the summons
recommendation.

if

there's no

That's your position, isn’t it?

MR. WALLACE: V7e.ll, it is — it has to be put in
contexto

The Special Agent —
QUESTION:

Well, ©•very tim© you say it has to b©

put in context, you’re saying you've got to hav© a factual
hearing, unless you’ve got a full —MR» WALLACE:

No, I agree with the position, but it

has to be understood in the context of two points.

One is the

statistics that we've cited in our brief on pag® 20, that show
that very substantial sums of fraud penalties &r© assessed as
a result of these investigations, without recommending ~ in
cases in which no recommendation for criminal prosecution is
made.

It's very difficult to anticipata which of these

investigations will fall into that category,
Th© second point, and a point I think is very well
made again in Judg© Friendly’s opinion for the Second Circuit,
again on page 12a, is that it’s not up to the Special Agent to
decide whether a case will be referred for criminal prosecution
to the Department of Justice.

He does not have the authority

to decide, h®*s not the responsible official to decide that.
We’re cross-examining these Special Agents about whether they
have a firm purpose to recommend criminal prosecution, but
that isn’t th© same thing as a determination that in all but

15
form a r©commandat!on of criminal prosecution will b© traas~
nsittad to the Department of. Jus ties.
The Agant, in determining, after his investigation is
concluded, whether to recommend prosecution, consults with his
group manager, whose recommendation will go along with his,
either agreeing or disagreeing with it, and I am told that in
& substantial percentage of the cases the group manager's
greater experience in discussing the case with the Special
Agent wi 31 change the Special Agent's mind about whether to
recommend criminal prosecution in a particular case.
We don't have figures on that, the Internal Revenue
Service does not have figures on that.

After teat takes place,

if the Agent's purpose, if the Agent's conclusion to recommend
criminal prosecution survives that, it teen goes

to tee Chief

of tee Intelligence Division’s distrist office,, who has the
authority to put an end to it right there, if he disagrees
with it.

That’s a relatively small percentage of cases that

got that far, and then he puts an end to it — there are cases
where he puts an end to it.
If he decides to carry it forward, he does not have
the authority to transmit it to the Department of Justice,
his only authority is to send it to the regional council, with
the recommendation that it b© transmitted to tee Department
of Justice with a recommendation for criminal prosecution.
The regional council w© do have figures on, and those

16

figures show that in fiscal year 1976 the regional council
declined to refer 14 percent;, 14.6 percent; of the cases that
reached that far, over to the Department of Justice? 349 he
declined, and 2,037 h© did refer.

In 1977 the percentage was

10„9 percent.
Nov;, the question necessarily arises:

What of the

cases in which the Agent had a firm purpose to recommend
criminal prosecution, but the evidence that he had at that time
that his purpose became fixed was not sufficient to persuade
his superiors to recommend criminal prosecution to the
Department of Justice.

What investigatory tool is available

under the statutory scheme for such cases under th© holdings
©f the Courts of Appeals, that say feat th© Agent*s purpose is
what’s controlling as to whether the summons is available?
The summons is th© only investigatory tool feat th©
Agent has? other than feat, all he can do is present his
credentials and ask for voluntary disclosures of information,
which banks and other — employers in ©fear institutions ar©
increasingly reluctant fe© make because they’re afraid of being
sued if they don’t have compulsory process.
There's no compulsory process available to the Agent,
except the Internal Revenue summons.

If th© Agent has a firm

purpose in mind# several Circuits have held h© can't us© that
process;.
subpoaaa.

That leaves nothing available

but a grand jury

17
QUESTIONs

In Re&sman v. Caplin, Mr. Wallace? had

th©r© been a recommendation for criminal prosecution?
MR» WALLACE; There had not.

There: was, in that case,

a dictum which I'll be happy to refer to, bacause — the
dictum did not refer to whether there was a criminal purpose
as being something improper»

What the dictum in fact said,

on page 449 of Volume 375 U»S»:
19Th® witness may challenge the summons on any
appropriate ground» This would include, as th© circuits have
held, 'th® defenses that th© material is sought for th© improper
purpose of obtaining evidence for us© in a criminal prosecution."
That's a mor© careful formulation of what is loosely
called "for a criminal purpose'9.'
QUESTION:

It reminds m@ a little of —

Well, it's not called for a criminal

purpose, is it, it's called for a purpose of a criminal
prosecution.
MR. WALLACEs

Y®s — well, for use. For us© in a

criminal prosecution.
QUESTION:

Yes, not for a criminal purpose.

That's

not the test.
MR. WALLACE:

To obtain evidence for us® in a

criminal prosecution»
But th® point is, th© Revenue Agent, the Special
Agent not only does not have authority to determine whether
th® racommendation will fo© made to -th® Department of Justice,

IS
he also does not; have th© authority to determine what: will b©
included in th© notice of tax deficiency that has to, under the
statute, be sent to -the taxpayer 90 days before the tax can
be assessed, so th® taxpayer has an. opportunity to contest it
during those 90 days in the Tax Court.
Then, again, it's up to his superiors to determine
whether that notice of deficiency should Include a 50 percent
addition to tax because of fraud penalties»

Anything that the

Special Agent can find out in the course of his investigation
that indicates criminal violations of .the tax cod© of a
fraudulent nature is supporting evidence by which his superiors
can make th® determination mere accurately, whether that
deficiency notice should include th® 50 percent fraud penalty®
So there's no way of differentiating th© Special
Agent's functions in getting that evidence between evidence
that's needed in order to carry out the civil assignment and
evidence that would show a criminal violation of th© Code®
And tee purpose of th© Reis man, dictum and its preserva­
tion in Donaldson I think is quite accurately stated by the
Second Circuit and by Judge Friendly, is to assure fete the
summons is not being us@d to trench on the authority of th©
Grand Jury ©r to broaden the government's right to discovery
in criminal proceedings.
In ©th®r words, that; fell© summons is not being used
after its civil purposes

spent, which is —

As a matter of Internal Revenue practice,

summonses ares not issued ones the notice of deficiency has b©<an
sent.

Hie summonses are used to investigate up to the point of

determining what should be in the notice of deficiency.

20

Now, it happens that increasingly th© returns of many

©f the summonses are not ras.de until after the notice of
deficiency is issued, because of all these proceedings about
whether the summons is ©nforcibl© or not»
But we cams to the Court in the hop© of restoring
the situation to getting returns of the summonses prior to the
issuance of th® notice of deficiency.
I’d lik© to reserve the balance of my time, if I may.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

That's a bright line

that all the Courts of Appeals would readily understand, would
it not be?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATT P. CUSHNER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. CUSHMERs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
First I’d lik© to respond to counsel's argumento
before I make my presentation.
Counsel indicated in his opening that the finding
©£ Judge McGarr was suspect, in view of to© fact th©r© seemed
to bo no contradichion in the testimony.
I think, viewing to© Appendix that’s been filed with
th© Court in this case, particularly page 52, w© find Mr. Parry
testifying exactly opposite to th© testimony of Mr. Oliver©,

21
or Special Agent Oliver©, concerning hie; purpose with respect
to the issuance of th® summons.
Special Agaafc Olivero mat with Mr. Perry and at teas
tim© testified that he had no civil purpose, Mr. Perry
■feast! fled fee that convers ation.
It se®ms anomalous that w© be in front of the Supreme
Court arguing an evidentiary question that’s been decided by
the district court after hearings and witnesses, viewing their
demeanor, being reviewed by the Court of Appeals for the
Seventh Circuit, the Seventh Circuit finding in a unanimous
decision that these was mor© than adequate support in the
record to the findings of tee court below.
QUESTIONS Well, but if Judge Friendly is right,
you aren’t here arguing an evidentiary question, because, in
his view, even if the evidentiary question is resolved in your
client’s favor, you still lose.
QUESTION?

Yes.

MR. CUSHNER:

I think teat is correct.

I think that

if an Internal Revenue summons may be issued solely in aid of
a criminal investigation, and teat’s authorized not only by
the statute but is constitutionally permissible, teen te©
evidentiary question will not male© any difference.

I think

that’s
QUESTION3 Well, putting it another way, if the
bright Ills©

if the line

and we’ll later decide white© r

22

that’s a bright lias — is whan the reconmieade.ti.on is mad® to
the Department of Justice for prosecution»

If that’s the line,

then feat’s the end of fee case, isn’t it?
MRo CUSHNERs
QUESTION:

Yes, if that is the line»

But --

lit doesn't make any difference what was in

fee mind of fe© AG®nfc0
QUESTION: That's right»
MR» CUSHNER:

Well, I would agree, if feat is fee line»

Tha problem is, if feat is the line, what is tsh©
reason for judicial review, and what is the distinction between
fee investigation befora the recommendation or after fee
recommendation?

If fee summons is proper before a recommends*"

id.on, why is not proper afterwards?

No criminal prosecution

is necessarily an essay after the issuance of a recommendation
to the Department of Justic©.
QUESTION:

Well, you're assuming that there's a

bright line in fact at all times in fee mind of fee inquiring
Agent, as there is & bright line if we draw the line feer©»
MR» CUSHNER:
such a line»

No, I suggest in this case there was

I think w© are not talking about generally all

the summonses that are issued all over fe© United States in
©very case»

I think this is a most peculiar case wife fee

most peculiar set ©f facts feat has been found that way»
QUESTION:

Well, what if you had a situation where

some people involved or wife knowledge of fee inquiry had as

23

their objective the prospact of a criminal prosecution and
others did not?

How -— V7bat about that?

Would that taint the whole summons because someone
in tii® Internal Revenue Service thought that there was a
criminal liability hero?
MR» CUSHNER:

Well, Mr, Chief Justice, I don’t think

it’s because someone in the Internal Revenue Service thought
there was a possibility or thought there was a criminal viola­
tion, I think it is the Agent who is conducting the investiga­

in question, It is that Agent who w© must look to to determine

It is the Agent who wishes the summons, and it is
the Agent who conducts the investigation» And the fact that
the Internal Revenue Manuals may prohibit

him from doing

certain things that may otherwise be in excass of the statutory
powers or, for that matter, unconstitutional, does not
necessarily meant that all government employees or, for that
matter, all Special Agents follow those,
I think th® testimony is uncontradicted when the

How

many grand jury subpoenas are actually issued in tax fraud
prosecutions?

Almost non© areever issued»

I mean, tear© ar©

: no statistics on it, but factually there are none almost
issued.
The fact of the matter is that by the time th©
Special Agent is finished developing these cases, turned them
over to th© Department of Justice, and th© Department of
Justice then referring them down to local U. Se Attorney's
office for presentment to a grand jury, the grand jury has
almost no vork^to do. They don't issue grand jury subpoenas.
Warrants of search-and-seizure don’t issu®.
These summonses ar© in fact being used as substitutes
for warrants of search-and-seizure, and substitutes for grand

If th© summons power of the

QUESTION: Well, supposing that th© summons is served
on the bank, your client, comes in under Donaldson, intervenes,
and is permitted to raise any Fifth Amendment or self-“incrimin­
ating objections that ha has? what more is he entitled to under

in conformance with those systems of justices that have grown

I don’t think that Congress has ever authorized

the agencies of tee United States to conduct this typ© of
criminal investigation.
Th© purpose of enacting this statute with which we'r©
dealing here is to deterron© really correct tax liability®
There’s been no finding in this e&s© teat in th© investigation
being conducted by the Special Agent it even relates to tax.
You know.

This is a very peculiar case based on tee peculiar

facts within this case, and I don’t teink it really presents a

32
question, other than th© way it's bean presented to th© Court?
— other t*iaan the way it's been presented to ‘the Court — that
lands itself to these kinds of argument».
The Special Agent has been conducting an investigation? it's unclear as to whether or not he’s conducting an
investigation even of tec 11 ability.

They say? they quote

various cases • saying that there have not been tax prosecutions
which don’t involve the payment of a penalty or a tax.

Well?

such is not the case.
The recent case in ‘She Seventh Circuit
?
of Dgv&rco} which didn’t deal with the underpayment of a
tax or the overpayment of a tax? but merely the misstating
of where income comes from.
There are many cases in which the Internal Revenue
Service can investigates taxpayers that has nothing to do with
she collection of a tax.

And I think Devarco is just on©

example of it.
I think that the personal purpose ©£ the Agent is
really not th© issue? it’s not the personal purpose generally.
The purpose of this Agent in issuing the summons was solely
in aid of a criminal investigation? not a criminal tax
investigation with th® possibility of a civil tax penalty?
but a criminal investigation.

And that’s th® problem that

we face.
I think even the Donaldson case gives us some
guidance.

I think Donaldson very clearly stated that th©

33

issuance of s. summons solssxy m axd ot. &

cumidiasI

jj&vn&B turgatron

is not a proper purpose*
la Donaldson, the real issu© bofor© the Court was
intervention, whether Mr, Donaldson had sufficient interest in
th© records to intervene. The Court decided against it.

But

Mr. Donaldson also raised, going through the Manual, going
through the Cod© of . Federal Regulations, the general duties
of the Intelligence Division to prosecute and to advance
criminal cases.
And the Court, 1 think, correctly stated that the
mere fact that these may foe the duties doesn’t inextricably
lead to a criminal prosecution, and the Court did not want to
deny the Internal Revenue Service because of these provisions
tee right to issu© summonses.
Neither did the district court nor th© Court of
Appeals in this case.

The finding was wholly consistent with

•she finding in Donaldson.

Th© finding in this case is not

merely teat the Agent was going ahead with a legitimate
lavestig&tion.
Th© point of tea findings below is that this was not
a legitimate investigation in furtherance of any statutory
duty or any statutory right teat this Agent may have had
pursuant to th© statute.
If judicial review is to have any viability in the
summons cases, th© mere fact that taxpayers or people summonsed

34
may exercise their right to judicial review does not mean that
judicial review somehow becomes something disrespectful of
the processes or sorts thing that & taxpayer or a parson
summonsed should not avail themselves of,.

It was provided

for just to prevent this type of abuse.
Th© mechanical application that the petitioners urge
upon -tha Court will do nothing to stop these abuses.

If th©

only rule is merely that an Agent has not recommended to his
superiors# and his superiors to th© Department of Justic©#
that criminal prosecution be recommended and instituted#
th© only thing a Special Agent used do is hold off on that
recommendation# as they do now# until th© criminal case is
completed# then turn it over# one© again have it reviewed by
Regional Council, determine whether there's sufficient
evidence to support a prosecution# and turn it over to th©
Department of Justice,
There's nothing magical about that recommendation,
Th© only thing about that recommendation is that it is clear
to all# one© that recommendation is mad®# that th© obvious
focus# th@ obvious purpose# th® obvious end of that investiga­
tion is solely criminal in nature.
The government —
QUESTION:

Mr, Cughner,, would you perhaps — m&yb©

I*m awfully dens© on this# but why is it an abuse to# for th©
Agent to take th© statute as it reads and just say# esX can go

mar,.” ? what in fch© statute makes that an abuse?

You kind of

assum® that, and I know Donalds on seams to, but I'm not quit®
sure I landersfcand why»
MR. CUSHNERs

I think it's an abuse because the

statute was passed for a specific purpose.

I don’t think th©

purpose of th© statute is to allow the agent to conduct a
grand jury.

I think the Agent is permitted under the statuta

to issu© summonses in aid of determining correct tax liability,
in aid of d@fcsrTd.ning whether ©r not incorrect tax liability
may lead to criminal prosecution under -the Internal Revenue
God®.
QUESTIONS But how do you respond to Mr.Wallace’s
argument that tax liability is a broad enough concept to
include fraud penalties?

And all these things may ©nd up in

fraud penalties.
MR. CUSHNERs

I agree th©y may end up in fraud

penalties, and that's «•**
QUESTION;

And is that a tax liability?

MRo CUSHNERs That is a tax liability.
QUESTION;

But that —

Then why doesn't it com® right within

the language of the statute?
MR. CUSHNERs

It does coma within th® language of th©

statute, but teat is not th© facts that are b®f©r© th© Court.
That was not the finding of the district court, nor was that

36

tiie findings of the Court cf Appeals below. They said that
the Special Agent had don© nothing nor© than focus his
inquiry on the criminal activities of the taxpayer; not
criminal tax activities of the taxpayer# but the criminal
activities of the taxpayer.
When the Special Agent was questioned as to whether
©r not he was using the summons to investigate possible 18
United States Code 1001 violations# that is, false statements
to the government, he said he wasn’t, but now that we had
mentioned it, h© would m&k© such inquiry.

It’s clear that a

summons cannot b® issued in order to determine whether or not
violations of ■die criminal statutes under 18 United States
Cod© exist; but the Agent stated ©a the stand, under oath,
that now that w© had suggested it to him, that’s what he would
in fact do,
QUESTION?

You seem to be assuming all the way

through your argument, Mr, Cushner, that there is a bright
and clear line when an inquiry moves from a civil into a
criminal, But isn’t it a realistic fact that many, many
inquiries start out, both in the tax field andother areas,
— fraud against the government -- start out on a purely
civil liability basis and move on and become criminal
prosecutions?
MR* CUSHNER;

MR. CUSHNERs But the indictment can be withdrawn»
and has been withdrawn in many cases,
QUESTION;

But they become an indictment. But the

Agent’s recommendations may b© accepted or rejected by his
superiors.
MR. CUSHNER;

I think that’s correct.

I don’t think

though» that Mr. Wallace or anyone else can ever point to a
case in which a Revenue

in which a Special Agent has

developed an adequate criminal case in». which that recommenda­
tion has bean declined» nor should it be.
The point is whether or not the Special Agent may
conduct solely a criminal investigation.

The Court has found

tees© are the facte that determine th® thrust of this case.
The Court has found that this Agent wasn't looking for»
attempting to find» investigating anything other than th©
criminal activities of th© taxpayer.

And whether th© Agent

may be authorized t© do that or not is not the question.
Is tei© Agent authorized to issue a summons in furtherance of
those activities?

And teat is what is impermissible.

I don’t think any court has ever held —

38

QUESTION:

You. mm an Impermissible under the statute

or under the Constitution, which?
MR0 CUSHNER:

I don’t think any court has ever held

or the constitution.
QUESTION:

and to bring some records. Arid I tell him — he shows up, and
I tell him, ’’You’re & target”, give him a learning»

Is there

anything unconstitutional about that?
MR. CUSHNER:

Just, if I understand your question,

Mr. Justice, that the U. S. Attorney has caused a grand jury
subpoena to issue?

I don't think there’s any constitutional

infirmity in that.

Yes. And so there’s nothing wrong with

MR. CUSHNER: Absolutely not. Grand jury subpoena
is the proper tool to be used.

39
QUESTION: Well now, suppose the statute in this
cas© had said on its fact that up until the time a reference
for a criminal prosecution has been made, summonses may issue
as the statutes says?
MR. CUSHNER; Then I think that they would not b©

applied, if you allowed a Special Agent to conduct a solely

MR. CUSHNER: Always warned by this lawyer.

MR. CUSHNER:

I think that even 'die citation of the

Then after quoting -that language from Donaldson,
which distinctly disapproves an investigation solely for

seem to indicate that you can issue a summons solely for

I don’t think Donaldson ever approved that,

Even Judge Friendly found, before he made his

Well, isn't it true that if they get

to the criminal prosecution, they can use the grand jury

MR. CUSHNER: That is correct. Justice Marshall.

MR, CUSHNER:

And you’re not brought into the grand

MR. CUSHNER:

Well, defense counsel offen does not

reach th© minutes of th© grand jury, may at times attack th©
abuse? of the grand jury.

And I don’t think that’s present.

43
Also the grand jury historically has been set up to protect,
the stand between th© power of the government and the citizens
with respect to th© accusatory process.

X dorffc think that

such guarantees or assurances rest with the Special Agant
conducting a criminal i.nv@stigati.on.

I think that’s wherein

th© constitutional abuse lies,, even assuming w@ can get
past what. I feel to

b© the statutory infirmities, th© conduct

of th© Special Agent in this case.
QUESTION: Well, your client still has his guarantee
of the right to b© indicted before a grand jury before h@ can
be held to answer.
MR. CUSHNERs

If the grand jury is left with nothing

to do, I think the guarantee of indictment by a grand jury
is rendered rather meaningless.

An indictment by a grand

jury after th© Special Agent, in the abuse of his process,
gathers all the evidence that a grand jury would historically
gather, th© grand jury has nothing to do but vote a true bill.
QUESTION:

Does it really make -my difference

'whether the U. S. Attorney comes in with the evidence all
•there before th© — and presents it to the grand jury, or
summonses witnesses and they present tee same evidence to the
grand jury as to whether or not tee grand jury is going to
indict?
MR. CUSHNERs
on a case-by-case basis.

I think teat would have to be decided
But if there was no difference, ws

44
could dispense with th© grand jury and turn all the government
agencies loos© with the subpoena power that is now resting
with th© grand jury. But that isn’t th© case.
Th© grand jury historically has a pl&c© in our
criminal system of justice
QUESTION: But it's protection for th© defendant*
it’s not that it has th© power to subpoena him* I would think,
but that it is required that h® be indicted before h© can b®
held to stand trial.
MR. CUSHNER; Well* before he’s indicted* fee grand
jury also

historically has performed the function ©£ gathering

th© evidence through subpoena.
QUESTION:

But this isn’t necessarily a help to him.

MR, CUSHNER:

It may not be a help, but at least

it’s in conformance with th© constitutional guarantees.

Not

€iv©ry —
QUESTION:

The constitutional guarantee is that

you cannot be tried criminally in fee federal courts ©xcapt
by indictment of a grand jury, feat’s th© constitutional

MR, CUSHNER: That’s correct.

But prior to indictment,

fee Constitution, I think, -comprehends or at least anticipates
feat fe© grand jury performs, a 'function, and hopefully that
function will be a meaningful on®.
I think that if fee Special Agent is allowed to usurp

that authority —

or whether a person has committed a crime with r-aspaet to
that tax return

As w® point out in our brief, the records of an
Illinois land trust basically consist of the trust agreement,
which is a standard form, standard in all banks in Illinois,
and the letters of direction, either to take title, issue,
sign a mortgage, those kinds of things.

Not necessarily

relevant.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Very well.

You have three minutes left, Mr. Wallace.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WALLACE?

There’s no basis in this case for

counsel’s suggestion that the finding was Shat there w@s a
criminal violation — a criminal investigation her© that may b@
unrelated to tax liabilities.

The Court of Appeals specifical­

ly says ©n page 5a of the Appendix to the Petitioner,
”Special Agent Oliver© was conducting an investigation of the federal tax liabilities of John Gattuso.”
And the district court says "respondents contend
that Special Agent Oliver© was in fact conducting an investiga­
tion of criminal violations of the Internal Revenue Cod© by
John Gattus o<"
Th© Miller case, which has been referred to involved
an attempt to challenge a grand jury subpoena rather than an
Internal Revenue summons.

It may fa© rare, but it was an

47
instance of the use of the grand jury subpoena in a tax
iav@stigat3.ojif and, as has been pointed out, the procedural
protections available to the taxpayer in an Internal Revenue
summons situation in many ways compare favorably to those
available in the grand jury subpoena situation, ©specially
with the enactment of Section 7609 of the Cod©, which allows
intervention in third-party summons proceedings.
Obviously the indictment, if there is to be on®, has
to b© returned by the grand jury, and evidence developed in
civil investigations, as the Court indicated in United Sfetes
vs« Kordel, in the course ©f a Food and Drug Administration
question raising the same issue, evidence 3®veloped in civil
lavestig&ti©as legitimately can later b© presented to a grand
jury.

And is pertinent to a grand jury.
The on© suggestion mad© on page 12a of Hi© Appendix

to the Reply Brief by Judge Friendly of tee possibility of a
wilfully false statement having nothing to do with liability,
is not something that ordinarily could b© .anticipated at the
tins® the Special Agent commences his investigation.
Ordinarily, the wilfully false statement teat a tax investiga­
tion would be concerned with is concealment of. th© source ©f
income, which is a common way of conc^Ling .deficiencies.
And whether a prosecution should later- b© brought, even though
it turns out that no additional liability is involved, is
not something that can fo® determined at th«9 outset in deciding

48
whether to follow up an lavestig&feion to see whether the
source of income has been concealed.
It can't be known at that point whether that will
indicate, in a particular case, that tear© is additional tax
liability.
had finally I want to say that what we’r© faced with
hers is a situation in which th© cases that suggest the most
serious problems ©f fraud, where th© Special Agent may think
this is likely to be a case where a criminal recommendation
will eventuate, are the cases where there ar© difficulties
in getting summonses ©«.forced and pursuing th© investigations.
whereas th© more marginal cases that th© Special Agents are
involved in, where they may not have much of a notion at th©
beginning teat this is likely to show a serious fraud are the
©ties whero th©ra* s no basis for saying that they have a firm
purpose that they’re going to recommend a criminal prosecution.
And we’re finding that; th© sol© investigatory tool
of the Internal Revenue Sorvic© is being denied early-on in
an investigation in th© more serious esses, leaving us with
only th© alternative of presenting unrip® investigatory files
to th© U. Ss Attorneys and to clutter up grand jury proceedings
where many of them would be weeded out in th© normal course
of th© Internal Revenue Investigations, after th© evidence
is developed and reviewed by superiors is mad®,
