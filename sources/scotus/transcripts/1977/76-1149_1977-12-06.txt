ORAL ARGUMENT OF EARL B. HOFFENBERG, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. HOFFENBERG:

Mr. chiof Justice, and may it

pleas© the Court:
This case is her© today for determination of the
right for an award of general compensatory carnages in a
failure to provide an adequate due process hearing where the
plaintiffs neither prove? any individualised injury or any
pecuniary loss.

The issue before this Court is whether or not

the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit erred
whom it; determined as a matter of law that, general compensatory
damages muefc be awarded for a violation of the Civil Rights
Act and sons proof of individua11sod injury or pecuniary loss.
Briefly, the record reflects the following facts,
wa have a consolidated matter before the Court.
plaintiffs, Mr. Silas Brisco being the first.
a student in the Chicago Public School System.

We have two
Mr. Brisco was
During the year

1972-73, the school which he was attending was changing from a
predominantly whit© school to that of a black school.

Daring

that time, the school officials noted that there was sane gang

activity in -the school and around the. area and some gang
recruitment, and had occasion to observe that during that
period some students were wearing earrings during that period
of time, and decided on that basis, after conferring with two
or three of the school officials, determining that it was
necessary in the interests of safety to ban the wearing of
earrings.
Mr. Brisco was on actual notice of this ban.
of 1973, Mr. Brisco was observed wearing an earring,
told to remove it.
called in.

He refused to remove it.

In May
H® was

His mother was

After extensive conversation with th© District.

Superintendent, Mr. Brisco removed'th® earring and no further
incident occurred.
In September of '73, when school reconvened, on
September 11th Mr. Brisco again wore th© earring to school.
The assistant principal and the 'principal instructed Mr. Brisco
to remove the earring.

He refused to remove th® earring.

Mr. Brisco’s mother was called.

She came in and she supported

Mr, Brisco's refusal to remove the earring, and Mr, Brisco was
suspended for 20 days for his failure to remove th© earring.
Mr, Brisco served 17 days of that suspension and was voluntarily
readmitted? pending motion for a preliminary injunction to
trial, District Court level.
Mr. Piphuss was a high school student in th® Chicago
public schools.

And on January 23, 1974 Mr. Piphus was observed

5
on school premises with another young man outside the building
but on school premises»

He wa3 observed by the principal

smoking or passing what the principal characterized as an
irregularly shaped cigarette.

As the principal approached, he

had occasion to observe or smell an odor which he believed to
be marijuana.

Ase h© approached, the cigarette was either

discarded or at some point the cigarette was discarded as- he
was taking fcha two peoples back to the disciplinary—the
assistant principal is the disciplinarian at the school.
Th© two boys denied any smoking of any marijuana.
They were taken back.

The principal instructed th® assistant

principal to follow the usual procedures of the 20-day
suspension.

This was followed, and Mr. Piphus was suspended

along with the other young man for 20 days.
At some time subsequent to this, the District
Superintendent reduced the suspension, and Mr. Piphus was out
■of scool for eight days,
The District Court in this matter, sitting as the
trier to fact on a stipulated record, determined that the
defendants' failed

to provide an adequate due process

hearing because he-determined that th© 20-day suspension
triggered & need for a full evidentiary hearing.

H© further

found that there was no good faith defense available to the
defendants, although he did observe that in Wood v. Str1cklend,
in which this Court determined a qualified immunity to the

6
board members and board employees, he did observe that we do
not have to predict the future of the constitutional law and
sine© this case arose prior to Wood vStrickland; h© said
•that necessarily would not apply.

But the doctrine of

Llawood v» Peoria, a Seventh Circuit case? which said that
anything over seven days make sure there is a need for a full
evidentiary hearing.

He said that based upon that rational©,

th® board would not be able to have a good faith defense and
that that was unavailable to th® board.

Although he did

observo that this was not—that obviously the educators were
trying to or were upholding the integrity of th© educational
process.
He further found that although they were entitled
to damages for the violation of the deprivation of an adequate
due process hearing, there was no proof of any evidence
submitted nor any evidence; which would even lead to a specula­
tivo inference to perform any measure of damages, and therefor©
he allowed no damages and the case was dismissed.
There was a-'motion for «.consideration filed on the
issue of damages.

The issue of damage was reopened and during

pendancy of the motion for reconsideration, th® District
Court

judge passed away.

Court judge..

After considering the matter, the other District

Court judge determined that th© motion

must be denied on the

Ha stated the same reasons.

Basically there

i
was no proof ©f any damages, and there was nothing which wonId
lead to any speculative inference which would allow measurement
as to the extent of damages.

So, he also denied -the motion.

The case went up to the Seventh Circuit Court of
Appeals on the issue ©f general compensatory damages and, as
I have indicated before, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals
bald that -as a matter of law the two individuals were entitled
to general compensatory damages, which was inherent in the
nature of the wrong, and that as a matter of law the measure of
damages were not so small as to trivialize the right or so
large as to provide a windfall.
We believe that-—
Q

I take it that in neither the District Court

nor in the Court of Appeals was there any finding or attention
given to whether the suspensions were justified?
HR. HOFFENBERG:
never questioned ©n appeal.

No.

The: issue of liability was

The main issue that was presented

on appeal was the issue of damages.
Q

I just want to know as a matter of fact, the

District Court did not address the question or make any
findings about the validity ©f the suspension.
MR. HOFFENBERG:
that issue.

No, it did not.

It did not reach

It just determined that we violated the adequate

due process.
Q

And on remand is there going to be any attention

8
to it?
MR, HOFFENBERGj

Thera will be only with regard to—

this Court on remand with regard to special damages,
petition.

We did not

The only regard to whether or not the suspensions

were valid would be on remand with regard to*the issue that
was raised in the Seventh Circuit as to special damages.

The

Seventh Circuit hold also, beside the general compensatory
damages, that tho claimants who raised this concept of it cost
$1,65 per day to educate a child and the concept that it would
cost—I do not remember exactly—*$1.52 per day to have® the
•student go to an out-of-city school, that was raised in the
concept of a special damage.

And the Court observed--the

Seventh Circuit observed at that point that if th© case is
remanded to determine what validity that has as a special
damages, the petitioner in this case, or the defendants, would
be able to defend ‘that position by showing that they would
have been suspended in my ©vent had they been afforded an
adequate due process.
Q

But that was never—

Suppose the District Court had addressed the

question of the validity of the suspensions and had found the
students ware properly suspended.

How would that change your

case?
>IR. HQFFENBERG:

Of course, obviously if they found

they wer© validly suspended, then the question—I do net think
the issue is not really—in front of th® Seventh Circuit—is

s
not. really whether the suspensions are valid,
Q

I just asked you how would your case be changed

if the District Court had found that the suspensions had been
validly imposed?
MR, HOFFENBERG.:

If they found that it was valid and

they still did not prove damages, I believe it would not change
it because I think the Seventh Circuit dealt with it on the
concept that regardless of 'the consequences of the suspension,
we are- not dealing with the suspension and its consequences,
whether or not it would be justified or whether or not it was
valid.

The question is whether or not you were entitled to

damages just for the proof of the violation of ‘the deprivation
of the constitutional right,

Thai is what we are dealing with

because tel a cas©-~-tha Seventh Circuit hold in a prior case
which they decided—
Q

But it might change the range of your damage,

you know, special damages anyway.
MR. HOFFENBERG?

Maybe special but not as to general

ocmpenaatexy damages because the Seventh Circuit really left
the whole issue of whether or not the suspension was valid.
They said that does not matter»

There is something inherent

in the nature of the deprivation—
Q

That issues though will be open in the District

Court?
MR. HOFFENBERGs

only in regard to the special

10
damages, not to the general compensatory damages.
G

Biit it. is still open.

MR. HGFFE&BERG:

It is still open.

That may be open.

That, is correct.

The issue of the suspension, the validity of suspension, will
be open as to special damages.

And I think we are talking

about about, bn that point, a total of a hundred and fourteen
to the specials and--I do not know—seventy-eight dollars
with regard to the other plaintiff as to special damages.
Q

Are you telling us now, counsel, that as to the

compensatory damages it is the law of the case that it is
based on this $1.65 a day?
MR. HOFFENBERG:

No.

Mr. Chief Justice, the law ©f

the esse.as it stands now is regardless—«w® are net her© on
tbs specif,1 damage issue.

W@ are here on the right to recover

for the general compensatory damages for the--inherent in the
nature of the wrong, for the deprivation of the constitutional
right to sai adequate due process hearing.

It does not matter.

The Court addressed the* special issue differently, that $1.65.
That is not the issue.

That is something which the Court triad

They dealt with that in terms ©f

They say it does not matter.

If you do not

hs.vcs say individualized injury, no pecuniary loss, it does not
matter.

You are still entitled to general compensatory

damages for the deprivation of a constitutional right.

11
Q

That ist a procedural constitutional right.

MR. HOFFENBERG:
Q

That is correct.

Mr. Hoffsnberg, am I right you did not raise

liability in the Court of Appeals, you did not contest it?
MR. HOFFENBERG:
Q

We did not contest liability.

You are only contesting it hare?

MR. HOFFENBERG:
Q

No, we are not.

As I read your brief, 1 thought you were.

MR. HOFFENBERG:

I am not contesting liability.

I

want to make it clear as I argue, we are not contesting

There was some question as to the facts.

We

The Court did not

We did not appeal the issue of liability.

And the case is strictly here on damages.

Liability was not

raised, and ws are not her© before this Court raising the issue
of liability.
Q

So, we are to take it here that fchs District

Court and Court of Appeals were correct in deciding or assuming
that these people were denied a hearing to which the Constitu­
tion entitled them?
MR. HOFFENBERG:

Yes, an adequate due process hearing.

1 want to make that clear because I do not think the Court
suggested-~I think fchs record will indicate—they did not say

12
there was not any hearing,

They just said that there was not

an adequate due process hearing.
The question is whether or not this holding of the
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is inconsistent,
with both the common--law rules for damages and what soma have
commonly referred to these 42 DSC 1983 actions as constitutional
torts or indignifeary torts.
let ms start from a case.

The traditional lav/ of damages--*
This Court ruled in Monroe v. Pape

in 1961 that 42 use 1983 must

be read against © background of

tort liabi11ty which makes a man responsible for the natural
consequences of his actions.

With that concept in mind, we

believe as long as we are going to—-as long as the basis of
liability for these 42 use 1983 actions should be read against
tort liability, w© should then look to tha relief granted in
tort law to determine what relief should be granted for
violations of this 42 USC 1983 act,
As this Court is well award, tha traditional law of
damages and which counsel concedes, the common-law rule of
damages in tort liability does not recognise any loss other
than that which is actual loss.

The Anglo-American law has

always been compensation oriented.

That is, w® compensate fch®

person to the extent that money can to make that person whole,
•ho put him in the same position whoh he has been injured, when
he establishes legal injury, that he would have been had the
deprivation not bean, or the wrong not been, committed.

To

13
feat extent; we believe that the law regarding compensatory
damages has always been that you sire entitled to compensatory
damages when you establish your actual, your legal
your fact ©f damage.

There is a breach.

There is & braach of that duty.

injury,

Thar® is a duty.

Th®r® is a legal injury.

And

one© you have established that legal injury, you are entitled
to recover, based upon that fact of damages.
W® have also recognized that just because, once you
have established the fact of damage, just because the amount
cannot be determined by any measurable standard, that amount
has to be passed upon the wrong-doing defendant, one® you hav©
established the fact of damage because the Court has recognized
that once you have established the fact of damages, you can
.leave fee jury to determine what value they are going to assess
upon that injury.
Q

Counsel, in your reply brief you quote from

dissenting opinion in Big®low v. RKO.

Proa what you have

just said, 1 take it that, you accept the principia laid down
by feha Court opinion in that case and in story Parchment that
if seme damages ar© established, the fact that you cannot put

We absolutely agree with feet

We,take the position that once

to make that determination, what they want, to place upon that
violation or that breach of their duty.
Q

But you say the plaintiffs hare did not. even

MR. HOFFENBERG;
in both.

The plaintiffs—“there is no proof

Remember two District Courts determined there was

no proof of that in the evidence «aid-™
Q

No proof of what?

MR. HOFFENBERG:

No proof of damages and nothing

which would even form any speculative inference which would
lead to any measure of damages.
Q

In other words—

No proof of injury*

MR. HOFFENBERG:

No proof of damages.

And again the

problem we deal with is the concept of the general terms of

iii a general sense.

But that does not mean on itself entitle

The best example I can give you, Mr. Justice, would
be In an automobile accident.
you may cause me injury.

If you negligently run into me,

I am injured.

Just the fact that t

am injured does not entitle me to recover.
as a result I broke my arm.

I must establish

Then the jury can determine

bread in the arm, actual injury, said they can assess an
intangible loss, the pain and suffering that may be attached
to that actual physical loss or the tangible loss.
We also recognise—and I am going to get into that—
we recognize the compensatory damages j the nature of
compensatory damages are twofold.

The special damage which is

'cq compensate the actual, tangible, out-of-pocket loss, and

ih.Q general compensatory damages, which is to compensate the
actual intangible losses such as mental distress, such as pain
aiic suffering, subjectively pain and suffering, embarrassment*,.,
mental anguish, emotional distress.

W@ recognize that once

you have established this fact of damage, you have been
humiliated, you have suffered soma pain and suffering, you
suffered some type of embarrassment, then at that point it is
dp to the trier of the fact to determine what amount they want
to assess against the defendant ones they have established that
fact of damage, that intangible loss•

16
The tort liability or the tort rules of damage in
tort law have recognised that where there is no actual or
legal injury there shall be no recovery.

However» the common

law has recognized—and 1 think this Court is well aware and
I think based upon the petitions for certiorari and the
amicus--all the circuits—I should not say all—many of the
circuits, the First, this Second, the Third, the Fourth, the
Fifth, the Tenth, have recognized that where there is an
invasion of some paramount right and yon have not established
any actual or real injury, you are entitled to nominal.damages.

h recognition of this, of just of a violation of the right
setting up this person, setting up the rights of the parties,
and recognize that—in that situation where you have not
established any damages, you may—the trier of the fact may
award nominal damages.

Q

That rule is contrary, is it not, to the common

law where if you proved a breach of contract, you were
untitled to nominal damages.

But in tort, negligence, the

existence of damages was part of your claim for relief.

And

even if you could show a wrong, if you could not show damage,
you were not entitled to even nominal damage.
MR. HOFFENBERG:

That is correct.

But the law has

developed in these circuits and in the lower courts, in
District Courts, after the Monroe case.
Q

On constitutional torts.

.By the way—

17
MR. HOFFENBERG:

Constitutional torts.

After Monroe, in 1944 I believe there was something
like 23 cases filed in the District Courts for violations of
42 USC 1903.

In .1961, right prior to the case ©f Monroe v.

Rap® that this Court decided, there was something like 283
cases filed.

In 1972 there was something like 8,000 cases

filed under 42 USC 1983.
over 16,000.

In 1976 there was something like

The reason I bring this up is that during that,

transitional period the lower courts and the courts

of appeal

for the circuits started recognizing the right to recover for
its intangible loss.
nominal damages.

They also recognised the right to recover

You may recover nominal damages when you have

established a breach of the constitutional right or the
constitut,ion.si tort.
The question also turns around on whether the Seventh :
Circuit—the Seventh Circuit created a new relief.

Our position

is that the Seventh Circuit created a new relief for the
violation of

42 USC 1983 which had not been previously recog­

nised in our compensation-oriented
Q

Anglo-American lav;.

Something- called general damages was known to th©

Q

Punitive is not here in this case at all?

MR. HOFFENBERG:

No.

The Court said—both Courts

said it is not punitive.
Q

But them we hav© special and general.

MR. HOFFENBERG;
Q

That is correct.

And you say them was no proof of any special

damage her®.

Perhaps there was but that is not in this case.

MR. HOFFENBERG;

We do not know.

The District Court

determined that was no proof for my damages.

Th© Seventh

Circuit said ther© was also some indication that it should go
back on special.
Q

That is not her©.

That is not her®.

MR. HOFFENBERG;

We are hers on th© general* th©

concept of th© general.
Q

And the concept of genara1 damages was

familiar to th© common law, was it not?
MR. HOFFENBERG;
Q

And what did it mean?

MR. HOFFENBERG;

value.

That is correct, absolutely.

General damage is a loss but. it is

It is something that you cannot put a monetary

It, is general loss, something that you do not have

out of pocket.
Q

Not something which you can—
And it was more than nominal, was it not?

I

mean it w&s not inevitably limited to nominal.

MR. HOFFENBERGt

No, it was not, no.

If you prove

19

your fact of damage, then—-if you prove that humiliation? if
you prove that pain and suffering? then you are entitled to
recompense for that.
Q

And you did not have to first prove the broken

arm either? did you?
MR. HOFFENBERGs

1 think, you did in terms of

establishing more than just a general injury.

If you

establish a deprivation of any right? if you are negligent?
if you negligently breach a duty which you owe to me, I have
to establish some type ©f fact of damage.

I cannot just—

again, the courts have recognised--in common law the courts
have recognized that you just cannot let juries speculate ?
just inform these violations—
Q

what does general damages mean in common law?

MR. HOFFENBERGs

General damages moan a right to

recover? as X see it.
Q

Money award.

MR. HOFFENBERGs

For a violation ©f somebody you duly

owed where you establish com© type of injury as a result.
3

And is that not, really all that the Court of

Appeals did her©?
MR. HOFFENBERGs

No, it went farther because it said—

it left out the fact of damage.

It presumed—it presumed some

type of fact of damage just from the mar®—from th© deprivation
C'f the constitutional right.

It went farther and said—the

20
Court: of Appeals said you establish a deprivation of a right.
There must be some injury here.
injury.

But again it is a generalised

It has not established that in fact these plaintiffs

have been injured.

All it did was—-well, there must be sane

injury which is inherent in fch© nature ©f th© wrong.

It did

not focus ©n th© individual loss or the fact of damage t© that
plaintiff.
Q

Mr. Hoffsnborg, would this case b© different

if th© issue ware a denial of either--to giv© you one
example— a right, to vote or, secondly, if there were a
deprivation of th© right to be free of an illegal search—say
someone had been searched—but no mental suffering in either
case, just the bar® injury?

Would it be the same issue and,

if so, how would you decide those cases?
MR. HOFFENBERG2

I think it would bs the same issue.

I think that the courts—and I think that in my briefs and in
counsel’s brief it dora refer to the voting rights cases and
the search end seizure cases.

Many of the search and seizure

cases all hold, as far ns we are concerned, or most of them
hold, where there is a deprivation of—of an invasion of a
search and seizure or a violation of the Fourth Amendment
pursuant t© the Fourteenth Amendment, that you ar© entitled
again to show any type of actual damage.

I think one© you have

established the actual damage, you ar© entitled to relief,
dust establish th® mere deprivation of an invasion ©£ the right

21
to b© free from the search»
Q

In a voting cas© how would you ever have actual

damage?
MR. HOFFENBERGs

In a voting right cas© I think that

th@ actual damages—again, the intangible loss.

I suggest two

things about the voting right cases that plaintiff has cited.
First of all—that we are talking about—many of the courts,
the lower courts and the circuits, deal with these voting
rights cases.

Ths one that they deal with most of all is th®

cas© of Wayn© v. Venable.

And that on© says damages are

pursuant from the deprivation.
case is a conspiracy case.
negligence.

But we look at that case.

That

That cas© goes beyond mar©

It goes to wilful.

Also that cas© was decided by

the Eighth Circuit in 1919.
3

What difference does wilfulness make if you are

not doing it on a punitive theory?
MR. HOFFENBERGs

mx

That is the point.

That is why I

suggesting that if it is not punitive, we have a different

concept.

If it is punitive—and many statas have recognized

you are not entitled to recover for deprivation of a voting
right cas®.

Th© majority of states now take th© position that

you arcs not entitled to a right to recover for a deprivation of

t.

voting right unless you establish actual malic® or some

evil intent.
As far as th® Wayne also—the Wayne cas© I believe, if

22

the Court looks at that case, it says you are entitled to
presume damages ©von though you have not shown any -tangible
loss, any monetary loss, could possibly—-I think it suggests
two things.

Number one, the idea that you do not have to show

any actual damages to recover punitivs damages, th© idea that
was established in Batista v. Weir, a Third Circuit: case, and
also 1 think that it started to recognize, as I indicated
before, this right to recover for this intangible loss-••you do
not have to prove that you have been out of pocket, that you
have had any tangible loss.

You have a right to recover for

this intangible loss.
I think I would like 'to address myself also to public
policy—
Q

What loss is there by not being permitted to

wear an earring?

Q

You do not agree that he is.

MR. HOFFENBERG:

Not on these facts.

Not on this

Q

How about the Tinker case about the arm band;

was that little boy injured?
MR. HOFFENBERG:

I do not recall exactly what the

relief was granted in that cases, the arm-band case.
Q

I believe it.

MR, HOFFENBERG:

But I mean—

The Tinker case.

But I am just saying when people ar©

denied the right to wear the clothing that they want to wear or
the jewelry that they want to wear, they are being denied
something.

24
MR. HOFFENBERGs

But just being denied does not mean

that ipso facto he has been injured.
Q

Mr. Hoffenberg, maybe I misunderstood this.

I

did not think that the damage here was the denial of the right
to wear the earring or the denial of th® privilege of smoking,

I was going t© get to that.

That is correct.

That is absolutely correct.

The

In fact, th© Court

just talked about the adequate due process.
Q

It is a denial of procedural- due process, is it

Why do we have all the discussion about general

The wrong is a deprivation of procedural due

MR. HOFFENBERG:

As far as h© is entitled to recover

I would like address myself in the time I have left
to the question of public policy also, which should be consid­
ered here.

And the question before the Court is also whether

26
th® Court should adopt this new relief, faced with this—th©
Court faced with this question, wa have to balance the interest
here# and I think w© should look to th® prior decisions in
tills Court in Wood y. Strickland and Goss v. Lopeg, th® right
t© due process for th© suspension and also the qualified
immunity.

And I think it is clear that the majority opinion

in th® Wood case suggests that we really should leave
management of tha schools to th© school districts.

We really

should leave th® school district alone to run their schools.
And w® really should b® in a position not. to deter qualified
people from becoming board members# from becoming board
personnel, and w© should not impose—
Q

Mr. Hoffenharg# if 1 could interrupt# this

argument goes to th® procedural due process # the policy involved

But if 1 understand your earlier statement# tha same

problem is.; raided when yem gat a Fourth Amendment question or
a right to vote question—
MR. HOFFENBERG:
q

—where you do not. have school boards at all.

MR. HOFFENBERG:
Q

That is correct.

That is correct.

Should th© school board policy cut across th©

whole spectrum of constitutional rights?
MR. HOFFENBERG:

Yes# X think so because again» even

in Fourth Amendment rights situations the concept of having
these police thwarted with this concept of not being able to—

27
I do net went to deal with it very much.
dealing with the exclusionary rule.

1 know this Court is

I do not want to deal as

much with the Fourth Amendment, but I do want to point out
that where there is a deprivation

of Fourth Amendment right#

there are policy considerations there, whether or not you are
going to not allow police officers—or you are going to require
police officers to almost look towards what they are doing if
there is a later determination that what they did, even if it
was negligent, caused some deprivation, even if it was
negligently.

And you have to look for the deterrent effect

of the police officer as we do to the deterrent effect here,
whether ©r not we should dater the police officer or whether
we should dater the board members, qualified board members,
whether w© should deter their duties, as opposed to the pos sib labenefits that would accrue to the plintiffs in this matter.
Q

This esse comes to us, as I understand what you

earlier said, that there was a violation of procedural due
process;, and any good faith defense* is out of the case.
MR. HOFFENBERG:
Q

That is correct.

So, you are saying there is a knowing violation

of procedural due process.

That is the way the case comes to

I believe—

KR. HOFFENBERG:

Yes.

I am for that.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER::

Mr. Elson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN S. ELSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. ELSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
First, it is important to point out that

29

petitioners8 argument is directed against only one of the
Seventh Circuit's four grounds for reversing the District
Court; is now vary clear.

The petitioners have not argued that

it was error for the Seventh Circuit to reverse the District
for its failure to grant declaratory or injunctive relief or
for its fed lure to consider the evidence that was in the
record which quantified respondents' injuries from being
wrongfully denied educational services for eight and seventeen
days of school.
Therefore, regardless of how this Court feels about
the question raised on this petition, it would ba necessary to
remand this case in order that the District Court can enter
the appropriate declaratory injunctive relief and can
determine the damages which are appropriate for the wrongful
deprivation of respondents' educational services.
Q

You are going beyond the damages for the denial

of a hearing, the due process violation.
MR. ELSON:
Q

Yes.

And you say there are two elements of damages

now to b© determined, on® for the denial of the hearing and
the other for the loss of schooling.
MR. ELSON:
Q

Right.

That is in the District Court, not here.

MR. ELSON:

That is in the District Court, and I was

just, clarifying that that is not here, and that is not before

30

this Court.

So, this case will have to be remanded back to

the District Court for a determination of those damages
regardless of how this Court determines the issue raised on the
petition.
In view of petitioners' statement of facts in their
briefs and party here, I think it is necessary to clarify that
certain findings of the District Court are not in issue before
this Court.

First, as now it is crystal clear there is no

question that the petitioners have violated due process and
that they are liable for damages under Wood v. Strickland.
And, second, despit© petitioners’ characterisations of the
respondents, there is no basis for disputing the District
Court's findings that the respondents always denied the
wrongdoing with which they were charged and that they were
never given an adjudicatory hearing of any type, and the
District Court was clear on that point, that specifically they
were nover given any adjudicatory hearing.
Q

I perhaps should not interrupt on this point,

but you say it is clear they are entitled to damages.
not what I understand.

That is

It is clear that they are entitled to a

hearing at which the school board may offer evidence that they
would have been suspended even if they had been given a fair
hearing.

Then there would have been no actual damages.
MR. ELSONs

Yes.

The Court of Appeals remanded for

a determination of possible consequential injuries.

The Court

31
of Appeals stated that* if the school board chose at that time
before the District Court to show that they were in fact guilty
of what they ware charged with, then they do not get compensa­
tory damages.
Q

Then your client will recover nothing unless

you prevail on the theory that Is in dispute here.
MR. ELSON:
Q

which is what?

MR. ELSON:
Q

That is correct.

No.

What the dispute is hers?

What is your theory here?

MR. ELSON:

Our theory is that it is incorrect, as

petitioners do, to equate the remedies that are appropriate
cor constitutional violations with the remedies that are
appropriate in breach of contract cases and technical trespass
oases.

In those cases, as petitioners correctly stated, you

cannot presume damages, injury, from the violation of the
right itself.

You have to have independent evidence of the

injury.
Q

You mean of the harm.

MR. ELSON:
Q

Some deprivation—

MR. ELSON:
Q

Of the harm,

Right.

Sera© tangible loss.

MR. ELSON:

Right, like walking across someone’s

grass would not b«a tangible loss.

You would have something ©Iss

32
for a technical trespass.
Q

What if it hurt your feelings?

That is not the

kind you are. talking about?
MR. ELSON;

No, those are the types ©f injuries we

are talking about, that, can be presumed from the violation,
where the interests which are protected by the right are of an
intangible natura, such as liberty, privacy, reputation, peace
of mind, dignity.
proximately

and

The violation of the rights in those cases
necessarily cause an injury to those

intangible interests.

In casas of invasions of privacy, of

.Liable and slander per se, false imprisonment and falsa
arrest, harm is presumed from the very violation itself, and
no independent evidence of injury is required.

You can show

such independent evidence of injury in order to increase your
damages.

But the eases are clear you do not have to show that

typo of independent evidence.
..%nd many courts have recognized that exactly the same
types of intangible interests that are at stake, that ar©
violated in these common law tort categories, are also injured
in violation of civil rights,
Q
understand you.

and petitioners—

hat me test that out a little bit and see if I
On your illustration of a claim for injury

and damages for someone walking across your lawn, if the
plaintiff showed merely that the defendant had walked across his
lavra and no more, that might justify a jury verdict of $1 or

33
25 cents, would you agree?
MR. ELSON:
Q

Yes.

But if it went, very much beyond that, do you

think, without any other evidence, would you think it would
be sustainable?
MR. ELSON:
Q

If there were a shewing of the actual—

No, just that he walked across the grass, no

showing that the grass was injured or that the grass died or
anything else % just walked across the grass and a jury
returned t. verdict of $10,000.

What would you think an

appellate court would do ©n review?
MR. ELSON:

I think an appellate court would reverso

and find that that award was not justified by the showing of
.injury.

There are sms early, very early, common law tort

cases when this theory was being worked out that did say that
for the trespass alone, the violation, you can get damages,
but that is not fell© law now, it is fairly clear.
The petitioners hava agreed with the many cases that
show, that state, that intangible Injuries are caused by a
violation of civil rights.

And the rationale for presuming

damages from the violation of the right in these civil rights
casas is exactly the same as the rationale for presuming
damages in these common-»lev?

intangible injury tort cases that

I mentioned.
Q

Mr. Els©?:;, why is it not certain that a 20-day

34
suspension is damaging when you fire denied your education for
20 days* period?
MR. ELSON:

To us it is very certain that that is a

very serious injury.
Q

But that is not the issue hare.

MR. ELSON:
Q

That is our point.

MR. ELSONs
Q

No. it is not the issue.
That is not here.

That is not in this case.

Right.

MR. ELSoh:

Because they have hot raised that as an

issue.
Q

When you say civil rights, do you mean any

right that is protected by the Constitution?
MR. ELSON:
Q

Yes.

So that if, for example, in violation of

Article 1 a state official laid a tax or duty on articles
exported from any statas—
MR. ELSONs

1 am sorry, I misspoke.

I am talking

about the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment*
Q

Why do you limit it to those?

MR. ELSON:

Because with respect to those constitu**

hianal rights-—there may be other constitutional rights, I
liava not given thought to the whole Constitution—but with
respect to these rights, intangible injury can be presumed
from the* violation itself.

35
Q

Why?

MR. ELSON:

Because they were intended to protect

important tangible interests, and you cannot violate those
rights without harming those interests.
Q

Why do yon presume that with respect to this

particular category that you have delineated and not with
respect to the rest of the Constitution?
MR. ELSON:

I suppose there would, be certain types

of rights where you just cannot presume any injury,

within

the Bill of Rights an Eighth Amendment violation could not
be presumed because in fact there you would have to have a
showing of serious tangible types of injury.

And I suppose

the same might be true of the interstate commerce laws.

I am

net really sure.
Q

What is the principle that enables you to

distinguish on® from the other?
MR. ELSON:

The principle is that if the right in

itself is inseparable from important intangible interests—
for example, if a school should make a public—speak, say a
prayer against his religion, then that violates his First
Amendment freedom to pray according to the dictates of his
religion.

And that in itself is an interest protected by the

First Amendment.

Or an intangible search is an example that

Mr. Justice Harlan gave in his concurrence in Monroe of an
unconstitutiuna1 search in which the interest invaded there is

36

the interest of being secure in your horns against arbitrary
governmental invasion, and that is; the essence of the Fourth
Amendment.

Or in this case—
Q

Does tills include all the frssdcms protected

by the Second and Third—
MR. ELSON;
Q

—and Eighth and Ninth and Tenth?

MR. ELSON:
Q

I think it vary wall might.

The Eighth is a differant question.

But yon do not include the Eighth?

MR. ELSON:

I would not think you could in the

presumed damage because it is fairly clear that in order to
reach an Eighth Amendment standard, you would have to make a
showing of fairly serious harm to the person.
Q

So, it includes seme of the rights and freedoms

protected by the Bill of Rights—
MR. ELSON:
Q

“"-but not all.

MR. ELSON:
Q

Y©s,

Not necessarily.

And probably not any of the other protections

of tli© Constitution; is that it?
MR. ELSON:

Not necessarily.

You would have to

look Et the right and earn whether it protects some intangible
interest.

MR. ELS ON s

How are you

I do not, believe it would be appropriate

for this Court to pick and choose and say certain—
Q

But you are, are you not?

MR. ELSON;

l am not picking and choosing now.

X am

just saying why X think that injury should be presumed from
tho violation of the right itself inevitably.
Q

Some of the provisions of the Constitution but

MR. ELSON:
Q

Possibly all.

1 certainly—

But you say omit the Eighth Amendment.

MR. ELSONs

7. think it would be difficult because

/ou already have to show objective proof of injury in order to
qualify fcr an Eighth Amendment violation.

So, there would Lm

io need to presume damages.
Q

Than he brings a 1983 action and recovers damages.
MR. ELSONs

Certainly at the time that he was denied

his right to a jury ferial,, he did suffer a loss.

He was

treated, unlike other citizens, with these civil rights.

I

mean, possibly if the jury trial did not make any difference,
the damages certainly would not be enormous, would not be that
great.

But he did suffer loss in that he was not given—he

suffered certainly th© indignity of not having his right to ©
jury trial adhered to.
Q

Does he. not have a tangible loss there?

Presumably on appeal, on this hypothesis, a new trial would be
ordered because of the denial.

And you have one tangible

measure of damages, namely, the cost of the first irregular
trial.

Suppose he could show that he had spent §4,000 in

There is a constitutional right not fc© be deprived of

MR, ELSONs
Q

That is right.

So, an essential ingredient of th® constitutional

violation is harm to either liberty or property.

Why should

.Km th® harm to th® liberty or property interest always be
messure of damages for the violation of the due process
right?

in- other words, why would you bring that which is not

before us rather than that which is before us?
MR. ELSONs

Because., according to th© rationale ©f

the Seventh Circuit-*-with which of course we agree—there is a
separat® type of injury from being deprived of the right

l

That.

;m.& there is a {separate right to a

MR. ELSON:

I took your answer to mean whenever a new trial

ae-apensate.d by getting a now trial, which is the traditional
re.• .«dy for that wrong, there in also a 19 83 claim for damages?
MRo ELSONs
Q

No, certainly not necessarily.

I thought that that was what you said.

MR. ELSONs

There would have to b® a showing that

tha viola-lieu of his right was knnying or negligent or that

42
it. should have; been—that they should have known that: he was
violating the right,

and certainly if it were done by a

judicial officer with absolute immunity or even a state’s
attorney.

So, it would be very unlikely that that would

actually happen.
Q

But that is just because of the immunity of a

particular defendant.
MR. ELSON:

It is not because of the right-Yes, there may be a real loss, as I

believe there is a real loss when somebody is deprived of a
right to a trial.
Q

Or the right, say, to be indicted before you

can be tried on a criminal offenso in a federal court.

That

is a constitutional right.
MR. ELSON:
Q

Yes, possibly.

And if you have not waived it, you have a

right of fiction if you have been tried as a result of an
information but not an. indictment.
MR. ELSON:
Q

Yes.

For monetary damages.

MR. ELSON:

Possibly if all the requirements have been

met.
In further response to Mr. Justice Stevens' question,
■mother measure, another reason for the injury suffered by the
deprivation of due process is the lost opportunity to make your
case to the initial trier of fact.

And that is something

43

different from the deprivation of the interest itself.

You

can never know at that time whether the opportunity to make
your case to the discretionary judgment of the initial trier
of fact would have availed.

So, even if it is determined

later—
I understand why the denial of a fair hearing

Q
can cause harm.

I am not. questioning that proposition.

But

I still must confess to some uncertainty about your response
to the five-year jailer ease.

Even though you assume th©

jailer holds the man for five years without due process of law,
I would suggest the value of fiv© years" imprisonment is the
measure of th® damages for that deprivation of a constitutional
right.

Then you say maybe later on he will be tried and

convicted.

That still does not seem to me to detract from th©

proposition that the measure of the harm was that he was
deprived of his liberty for five years without any constitu­
tional protection.

That still is the measure of the damage

for that constitutional wrong, which in this case would mean
the eight or twelve days or whatever the children were out of
school would ba the measure of damages her©.
MR. ELSON:

That may be one measure, but it would be

a very drastic penalty on our government to make them pay for
fiv© yearn imprisonment that should have been served and would
have been

sense, the seventh Circuit—

In this

44
Q
the judge

The protection against that normally is that
gets immunity and there are all sorts of defenses»

The damages are not awarded automatically in these cases.
MR. ELSON:

No, that is correct.

But in the

rationale of employment cases whore those immunities would not
occur,, if someone was deprived of employment or without a
hearing aid it turns out that there was all sorts of 'cause to
get rid of that person and the person is out, say, for ten
years or something, under that rational®, those injuries being
the only measure of damage, the damages would be tremendous
for an employe© who should have been fired.

And the Seventh

Circuit’s position really is kind of a middle way between that.
It. just gives damages for the actual harm suffered by the
deprivation of the right.
Q
cub©

Let me put this case to you.

Supposing in this

they brought the student before the principal and had

summary procedures that ware clearly unfair, they quizzed him
or.® way or another, but then they did not suspend him.

You

would not have any claim -then, would you?
MR. ELSON:

No, none at all because there was no

protected liberty or property interest that was violated.
Q

So, obviously there must bs harm in the sense ©f

loss of property or liberty before the deprivation of a fair
hearing has any constitutional significance.
MR. ELSONs

Definitely.

It triggers the harm.

45
Q

On that basis,, if it is determined now in this

due process at the time—
Q

I understand, but you were deprived of your

chance to have a hearing.
MR. ELSON:
Q

You think that is compensable?

MR. ELSON:
Q

Right.

Yes, that in itself is--

Is that inconsistent with the answer you gave to

46
Mr. Justice Stevens?
MR. ELSGN:
Q

I do siot believe it was.

Even though the injury to the liberty is zero?

the right to stay in school, the thing that

triggered your

right to a due process hearing—even if it is determined that
that invasion was zero, yon say that you are entitled to
damages?
MR. ELSON:

Yes, if it was later determined that it

was zero because at the time you were deprived of your interest
in, having a hearing and making your case to the initial
decision-maker besides the indignity that was suffered.
Given that the constitutional rights, in our position,
cannot be separated from the intangible interests which those
rights are intended to protect, it is not surprising that the
common law has long recognized that the damages may be presumed
cron the violation of civil rights themselves.

There are no

special remedial rules for civil rights cases which exempt
them from this normal rula that damages should be presumed
where intangible injuries are the natural and proximata
result of tli© violation.

And sines 1703 in the English voting

rights case of Ashby v. White, the common law has recognized
the principle that every injury to a right imports a damage*
And Mr. Justice Holmes relied on this principle in Nixon v.
Herndon,

And that casa held that -i valid claim for substantial

damages was stated when the only harm alleged was the

47
deprivation ©f equal protection, which arose out of the denial
of the right to vote on the basis of race.

I think cur brief

incorrectly described that as a voting rights case when in
fact it is an equal protection case.
And th®.re are also many other American voting rights
eases that recognise this principle.
Petitioners* argument is net only contrary to these
common law cases, it is also contrary to congressional intent
that courts apply the most effective remedies that are
available for the purpose of deterring violations ©f constitu­
tional rights.

It is clear from the congressional debates

and from many opinions of this Court that th© primary purpose
of Congress in enacting the Ku Kluac Act of 1871 was to detar
constitutional rights violations.

.And in Section 1988 of

Title 42, Congress gave the courts specific direction as to
how they were to apply remedial principles under the civil
rights laws in order to achieve that deterrent purpose.

And

is; this Court stated in Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, courts
war® to use whichever federal and state rules on damages would
bolter serve the policies of the federal statutes.
The technical trespass damage rules proposed by
petitioners would obviously be less effective in deterring
civil rights violations than the damage rules in the voting
rights cases and these intangible injury cases in Nixon v.
i tern-don.

A rule that required independent proof of injury far

48
tha award of damages for civil rights violations would give
officials absolute immunity from damages where th© nature of
the constitutional right is such or the circumstances of a
violation are such that affirmatively provable injury is
unlikely to result from the violation, examples of the First
Amendment cases cr due process.
It is exactly such absolute immunity that petitioners
are asking for in their reply brief on page 28, where they
query whether as a result of the Seventh Circuit's decision
educators would have to think about—they say research—their
own discretionary acts in terms of the possibility that a
court might find them liable for damages for violating a per­
son's civil rights.

But it was precisely 'to force officials

to give consideration to avoiding constitutional rights that,
this Court rejected educators' claims of absolute immunity in
/tood v. Strick!and.
There is nothing about the particular type of
compensatory damages

awarded for the deprivation of civil

rights, which is relevant to whether educators should b© allowed
to violate: civil rights free of any concern for their
accountability under tha civil rights lews.

The rationale of

Wood requires that public officials not be given such a zone
of immunity for their constitutional violations where the
.interests protected by th© rights are of such an intangible,

unquentifiable nature.

Q

What if fch© plaintiff in a civil suit is cross-

examined and you ask him about his damages~ "Did

it hurt your

feelings?"--you ask about all the intangible things you can
think of.

And h© says, i!Hof but I am still entitled to some

damages because I think you ought to be deterred from
violating my rights."
MR. ELSON:

In that case, such evidence certainly

would go toward reducing—in mitigation of the damages.
Q

Yes, but zero or not?

MR. ELSON:
Q

No, not to zero.

So, you do espouse openly and frankly you must

give some money, soma substantial award, to dater.
MR. ELSON:

I would point out that is not this case.

There is no evidence in this case.

But, yes, I would say that

was that.

And your submission is?

,

MR. ELSON:

le that the most effective remedies

■available inthe common law to be used

and the presumption of

damages from the violation itself is a remedy that is traditional to the common law and should be used in these cases.
Q

So, you do not think damage is limited to what

a jury or judge might think the intangible injuries to the
plaintiff ar©?
MR. ELSON:

No, certainly they are limited to that.

but with the instruction—

Q

You say they ar© limited to that?

MR. ELS ON:

With the instructiori that the damages be

not so small, as the Seventh Circuit said, a3 to trivialize the
right«
Q

Y©s, but I posed to you the case where the

plaintiff frankly concedes, "As fair as I know, I have had no
intangible injury.

I just think that I ought to have some

damages because you should not violate my rights anymore."
MR. ELSON;

First, I world pose that that is an

unreal type of situation because there is always injury, it is
our position, when these rights are violated.

But for purposes

of the hypothetical, I would analogize it to liable per se
where there is a conclusive presumption of some injury, which
of course can bo mitigated by such a showing.
Q

Yet in liable per s® a jury can return a verdict

for $1.
MR. ELSONz

I believe that might foe contrary to what

•the rule, is for liable.

Of course they may return it, but I

think that h© might hs entitled to more damages.
Q

You think that just could not ba upheld on

appeal under the normal rules of liable?
MR. ELSON;

I think it might well not foe.

Yes, undar

thm normal rules where there is a conclusive presumption of
some injury.

Now, it is possible-But I thought you said $1.

51
MR. ELSON:

That would be nominal, not substantial

compensatory injury.
Q
20 years, the

Suppose you handle this casa a long time, 15 or
jury is going to award $1 actual damages and

375,000 punitive damages.
MR. ELSON;

In that case, if there were substantial

evidence, mitigating the conclusive presumption of damages, then
it could be reduced.

Now, to $1 I am not sure because that

would, conflict in this case with the deterrent policies of
Congress,
Q

Mr. Elson, in this very cass, assuming no

wilful misconduct by the defendants and just, the facte that
you have, what do you regard as the dollar value of the damages
to which you client is entitled?

Th@ amended complaint purports to be a class

It was originally filed as a

No class was certified.

Q

No class was certified.

But does that mean that

Brisco is the only party before us?
MR. ELSONs

No# these are consolidated cases in the

District Court with two students.
G

So, you have asked $5,000 for one. and $3,000

for the other?
MR. ELSON:
Q

Yesr at the time.

What is the difference?

MR. ELSON:

They were represented by different

attorneys, I guess, who valued different amounts.

[Laughter]

But there era differences in the fact situations, of course,
which may justify the juries coming up with different awards
of damages.

There ware First Amendment protected interests

implicated in the Brisco case, not implicated in the Piphus
case.
Q

But these damageu also assume some injury fr :

MR. ELSON:

Yes, but th@ injury that would b®

all grievance across the board.

You think the possibility of a plaintiff

securing attorney’s fees would not be enough of a deterrent
to defendants?

No, not necessarily.

Thor© is no

Mr. Elson, the record will show that there are

The point to that is that-—yes—

Go ahead and respond to Justice Marshall.

MR. ELSON:

Oh—that the law presumes conclusively

that some damages have occurred, and in rebuttal certainly, in
mitigation, those damages can be lowared to a minimal amount.
Q

You ara not claiming that this deprivation

averred in your complaint was the result of malic©, are you?
flR. ELSON:

No.

Th© complaint makes a claim for

malles, but that was not proved and that is not an issue.

Right.

The District. Court found no malice.
That is right.
