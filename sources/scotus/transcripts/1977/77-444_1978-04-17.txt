MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURNER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Penn. Central Transportation Company
against The City of Mew York.

Mr. Gribbon, you may proceed

whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. GRIBBON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. GRIBBON;

Mr. Chief Justice and Justices of the

Court:
Perhaps I should be intimidated legally, if not
physically, by the sheer number of governments and organisations
on the other side of the question presented on this appeal.
There have come to the support of the appellee, the greatest
city in the world, three other major cities, the nation's two
largest states—
0

When you say greatest, are you referring by

population or—[laughter].
MR. GRIBBON:
Q

Or weather?

MR. GRIBBON:
Q

I would prefer to encompass all aspects

I will still stay with greatest.

Or total tax.

MR. GRIBBON;

[Laughter]

Total tax?

It may qualify on all those

scores.
0

Which city are you referring to?

MR. GRIBBON;

Nob Chicago.

[Laughter]

[Laughter]

4
In addition, 20 civic organizations, all highly
respected, and finally the United States has had sufficient
interest not only to file a brief but to participate in
argument.

But I arn not so intimidated because the position that

I put to you here on behalf of Penn Central rests on the Bill of
Rights, that great charter of liberties that serves as a
protection against all government, not just venal government
but even the best intentioned government.
In addition, I would suggest that the unusual
display of public interest here serves to emphasize a principal
element in Penn Central's case; that is, the enormous public
benefit which, it is claimed, will be brought about by the
governmental action that we challenge.
As a result of actions taken by the New York City
Landmarks Preservation Commission, pursuant to the city's
landmarks law, Penn Central has been prohibited from construc­
ting an office building over the Grand Central Terminal,

That

prohibition has been imposed by the city not because such a
building would be unsafe or uneconomic or in violation of
zoning regulations but solely to assure that all who live in
New York and all who visit New York will have an unimpeded
view and unrestricted enjoyment of the terminal, a structure
which the commission found to be a magnificent example of
French Beaux Arts architecture„
After the terminal had been designated as a landmark

5

by a commission of 11 private citizens reporting generally to
the Board of Estimate,' three separate efforts were made under
the guidance of the internationally known architect, Marcel
Breuer, to persuade the commission, in accordance with its
procedures, that, an office building could be constructed
without impairing the integrity of the terminal*
were rejected.

All three

And it is now common ground among the parties

that Penn Central stands effectively precluded from constructing
a building over the terminal.
The record discloses that in return for the use of
the air rights over the terminal, Penn Central would receive
from a developer, who would bear all the risks of construct?ng
the building, a million dollars a year during construction
and thereafter a minimum of $3 million a year, escalating as
rental collections increased,,
Q

Is there in the record anywhere a picture or a

drawing, an architect's drawing or a sketch, of xtfhat this
building would look like?
MR„ GRIBBON;

There is, Your Honor*

At Record 2001*

It is in Volume 4»
Q

Not in the appendix.

MR„ GRIBBON:

Not in the appendix, no, Your Honor.

It is in the record that came up from the lower court—
Q

Thank you„

MR,. GRIBBON;

--which is lodged, I understand. .

5

I say, therefore, that there can be no doubt that
the city's action, has deprived Penn Central of something of
valueo

While the city recognizes that Penn Central has been

denied the right to

construct an office building, which it is

entitled to do otherwise under applicable zoning regulations,
the city refuses to acknowledge that air rights constitute a
form of property.

It even suggests that the use of the term

is something of a semantic trick.

Such rights, however, have

been widely used, sold, utilized for 50 years, and the Court
of Appeals did not hesitate to describe the controversy as one
involving air rights to the terminal.
I do not urge that the decision here should turn on
whether Penn Central's loss is characterized as a property
right or as a use.

As the Solicitor General correctly puts it,

it is the substance of the government action that controls
rather than the labels that are attached to it.
Q

You do not question the right of the City oi

New York to take this entire property, do you?
MR. GRIBBON;

No, Your Honor.

The issue raised here

is not, as some of the briefs here seem to suggest, whether
the City of New York may validly preclude Penn Central from
constructing a building.

Twenty-five years ago in Berman v.

Parker this Court in a unanimous opinion proclaimed for all
that it is just as appropriate for government actions to look
to things that beautify and enhance the quality

of life as it

7
is to do away with things that are unsanitary.

But the issue

here, simply stated, is. Who is going to bear the loss or the
burden that is occasioned by this substantial public benefit?
Q

Is there any doubt about how this case

would

have ccme out before the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment?
MR. GRIBBON;

I would think the same considerations

are present now, Mr*. Justice Rehnquist.
Q

What would you have relied on before the enact­

ment of the Fourteenth .Amendment?
MR. GRIBBON;
Q

We think the Fifth Amendment.

But Baron y, Baltimore said the Fifth Amendment

applied only to—
MR. GRIBBON?

There right have to be a little

rewriting of some of the decisions there.

But looking at what

the Fifth Amendment has been held to do since then, I would
have thought, that the Fifth Amendment would provide assurance
here.

If it were to come up today without the Fourteenth

Amendment, it is very difficult to imagine those circumstances

irr today's legal climate.
Q

In today's legal climate, I mean, you do not

have to be that vague.

Has not. a case from this Court held

that the Fourteenth Amendment does incorporate the Fifth
Amendment—
MS. GRIBBON:

Yes, Your Honor.

I have not dealt

with that, and I would not propose to do it on that basis.

I would propose to address the issue that 1 have
stated here first by examining the central premise of the
different justifications that have been advanced first by the
Court of Appeals and, second, by the city and its friends for
imposing the full cost on Penn Central.

And that premise is

that where the government acts in a regulatory capacity
rather than through the exercise of eminent domain, there is
no need to inquire

whether there has been a

compensable taking.

I shall next show that the decisions of this Court
interpreting the Taking Clause of the Fifth Amendment,
particularly those emphasizing its high content of fairness,
support the conclusion that the prohibitions imposed here do
constitute

a taking for which compensation is constitutionally

required.
Q

You talk about the full cost.

Full cost of

what?
MR. GRIBBON:

Of not being able to build an office

building, the loss that is suffered by being prevented from
developing an office building over the terminal.
Q

It has been held in a case—Hudson, 1 think it

was, that a municipality could limit the height of all
buildings within its borders.
MR. GRIBBOH:

Your Honor, I think that is true.

The

height limitation cases I do not believe have application here
because--

Q

Why not?

Q

The Pan -Am Building—it is not to show this

building.

Why is that not a taking?

Excuse me.

It is not to show this building.
MR. GRIBBON:
Q

It is right next door.

MR. GRIBBON:
0

No, Your Honor, it is there.

It is right next to it.

Why is not—

IIR. GRIBBON:

It is selective, Your Honor.

It does

not say—
Q

The taking is just the same, selective or non-

selective, is it not?
i

MR. GRIBBON:
Q

No.

I think under the zoning—

There might be discrimination, but from the

point of view of the taking, it is just exactly the same if
you limit every building in the municipality to no more than
15 stories.
MR. GRIBBON:

I think the decisions indicate that

the zoning, which is comprehensive and applies substantially
equally to all people affected within the fires., can be tolerated
as a nan-compensable taking on the ground that the benefits and
the burdens are reasonably dispersed.
Q

From the point of view of the property owner,

the taking is precisely the same.
MR. GRIBBON:

That's right.

But I think the fact that

other people fire similarly burdened and presumably similarly

10
benefited by the height limitation has served to justify the
zoning cases, and I do not think it can serve here to justify
this selective, highly particularized taking.
Q

I can understand your argument based upon

discrimination of some kind.

But if it has been established,

as 1 think you concede it has, that a municipal government can
limit the height of every building within its borders, why is
it not, from the point of view of the property owner, just as
much a taking in that case as it is in your case?
MR. GRIBBON:

I think in many instances there is just

as much of a taking on the property owner when that something
is done by regulation as by eminent domain.

But in the

regulation cases where you are removing offensive uses or
where in the zoning cases you are acting broadly to take care
of the entire community in distributing the burdens and the
benefits, it has been held not to be a taking.
In terns of the English language, yes.

In terms of

tha Constitution, I think it is just that difference.
G

Is not the point, in the situation that you are

referring to, as distinguished from that which Mr. Justice
Stewart is referring to, tha taking of some but not all or the
taking of one but not all the others?
MR. GRIBBON:

That is right.

height limitation for one building.

Selective.

It is a

All of its neighbors,

including Pan Am and all of the others, can go much, much

11
higher.
Q

This I fully understand.

I still have difficulty

understanding why it is not much a talcing in one case as in the
other, quite apart from any argument based upon discrimination
or irrationality or anything else.
MR. GRIBBON:

All I can say is that the zoning cases

have viewed it as being a permissible use of the regulatory
power when it is done in a way—
Q

You do not try to justify it rationally.

You

just say that that is authority, not—
MR. GRIBBQN:

That is right.

I do not know that it

is not rational to say, when all the people within the area
are similarly treated, nobody can have a residence or nobody
can have industry.

That is a permissible use of the govern­

ment's power.
Q

Several wrongs do not make a right.

They make

just several wrongs, do they not?
MR. GRIBBON:

Yes, I think that is right.

depends on whether it is wrong to start with.

But that

The Constitution

does not prevent the government from effecting necessary
regulations.

And every action of government has to have some

kind of adverse effect on somebody.

The question is where the

line is going to be drawn on that adverse effect
Q
somewhere?

Is there a matter of equal protection here

«

12
MR. GRIBBON:
protection.

Your Honor, we do not argue an equal

I think it is a solid case for a taking.

The

equal protection cases do not give a great deal of comfort.
It perhaps is x^arranted for the government to pick out an
historic site and say this should be preserved.

We do not

think it has to pick out every site, and you cannot argue as
to which site is historic.

And I think it is sufficient that

we simply argue that whan they do that, they pay for what they
take for the public benefit.
Q

And the theory behind the taking-—I will avoid

0

the use of the word "taking."

The limitation because it is

an. historic place, historic monument, is that that is for the
benefit, of everyone?
MR. GRIBBON:
Q

Yes.

Of everybody.

So, you say if it is for the benefit of

everybody, everybody should pay for it.
MR. GRIBBON:

Everybody should pay for it.

And there

is no balancing of benefits and burdens as there is the
zoning cases where, as Mr. Justice and I have just been
discussing, the Court has held

that they are not within the

taking provision.
Q

Is not part of the reasoning for the generalized

use of the height regulation the notion that all of the
buildings that are subject to that height regulation also
derive some benefit from it in that their competitors, so to

13
speak, cannot build above them, and each of them will have a
good view from the top floor and that sort of thing?
MR. GRIBBON:

Precisely, Your Honor»

There is a

fair distribution not only of costs but of burdens, and that
therefore there is no taking.
Q

The benefits, as my Brother Relinquish implies

in his question—the theory is, I think, that the benefits are
accorded to everybody in terms of light and air and so on.
MR. GRIBBON:

Yes, which is not true here.

solely burdened and unbenefited«

We are

Everybody else, not just the

building but the visitors and the people that do it, are the
ones that get the whole benefit out of it.
The first point I wanted to make is that however the
government acts, whether by eminent domain or purporting to
act by government regulation, there must be an inquiry into
whether there is a compensable taking.
brushed that over.

The Court of Appeals

They simply recited this is government

regulation and, therefore, there need be no kind of inquiry
into taking.

Those who support the court's action take the

same view, that automatically, once you can say this is
regulatory action, then there is no occasion to look to see
whether there is compensation.

That is the premise that under­

lies both the Court of Appeals decision and also the position
submitted by the city here, and I think it is not supported by
the Fifth Amendment itself or by the cases,

mhe Fifth

14
Amendment does not, by its terns, apply only to cases of
eminent domain.

It applies broadly.

And cases in this Court

have held that whatever governmental power is exercised—
police power, commerce power—-if there is a taking, you look
to see whether the Fifth Amendment comes into play.
I suppose Bernan v. Parker, which I mentioned earlier,
stands for the proposition that the right of government to
bring about changes designed, as they put it, to enhance the
quality of life all comes within the police power, whether
it is done under eminent domain or whether it is done through
the exercise of regulatory action.

And in most of the cases

where there is a problem as to a taking, there has not been an
exercise of eminent domain.
has operated in a way

It is government regulation which

which may constitute a taking, even

though the exercise of eminent domain has not been tried.
It is claimed here that the Goldblatt decision of
-—

—.———

this Court establishes a. different rule, a rule that says you
do not look in a case of regulation to what has been taken.
You look, rather, to what is left over.

That decision does

contain some language with respect to the uses left to the
property owner.

But I do not believe it establishes anything

like what the decision claimed here.

The challenged regulation

there prevented the sand and gravel company from continuing
its operations on property that was originally rural but had
become surrounded by the city of Hempstead.

Far from saying,

as is urged here, that valid regulatory action cannot result in
a compensable taking, the Court, speaking through Mr. Justice
Clark, acknowledged at the outset the basic principle on which
we rest our case, saying government action in the form of
regulation can be so onerous as to constitute a taking, which
constitutionally requires compensation.

It then found that

there had been no diminution in the value of the property
involved and, therefore, there was not any taking.

It went on

to find, despite the owner's claim that sand and gravel
operations were utterly benign and unlike the other things that
had been barred by the exercise of the government regulation-the Court overruled
be upheld

him and said on safety «grounds this would-

as a valid exercise of police power.

But it did not

say that as a substitute for a finding that a taking had not
taken place.

And I submit that that is the initial inquiry,

whether a taking has taken place.

And that is the inquiry that

the Court of Appeals did not make and which those supporting
the city would not make.
Those words, that, constitutional guarantee, that
property shall not be taken without compensation, incorporate
an exceedingly complex constitutional concept.

And though it

has been with us since the beginning of the Republic, nothing
approaching an all-purpose principle has been articulated
from which one can discern the specific application of the
concept.

And this Court has time and again turned down the

16
opportunity to enunciate any such principle,
A scholar in the area recently wrote:

"The judicial

efforts to chart a usable test for determining when police
power measures impose constitutionally compensable losses have
on the whole been notably unsuccessful.

With some exceptions,

the decisional law is largely characterized by confusing and
incompatible results, often explained in conclusionary
terminology, circular reasoning, and empty rhetoric."
ere the scholar's words, not mine.

Those

Bu,t I hasten to say that I

have no all-purpose test to offer the Court.

And I acknowledge

more than the normal humility with which one must approach such,
constitutional questions=
I do put to you, however, that a review of the
taking clases does disclose two guidelines that may usefully be
applied here in determining whether the city's action consti­
tutes a compensable taking.

When regulatory action is directed

towards the elimination of offensive uses or conditions, it has
been held in many cases that the resulting loss to the property
owner is non-compensable because it is one that he may be
properly called upon to bear for the public good.

Such cases

began, as you all knew, with the elimination of nuisances,
common nuisaiices, and then went on to encompass other
properties and uses which, though not nuisances, were offensive
to the general tenor of the community such as breweries and
b aer halls and livery stables.

i?
The construction of a multistory office building in
inidtown Manhattan, which Penn Central is prohibited from
doing , is not only permitted by the zoning laws but is
actually encouraged as an efficient use of valuable land.

And

I submit, therefore, that the principal justification for
tolerating some nan-compensable diminution in property value
as a result of government regulation lends no support to the
city's action here,
Q

Would you be making the same argument here if

all you wanted to do was replace the building with one of the
same height, just that the building was inefficient and you
wanted to build a new building, but you are quite willing to
not go up with it, the same height?

And the city said, "No,

wa want you to keep the old building."
MR. GRIBBON:

I think if it caused us loss-—and from

what you say, it would cause us loss—we would be making the
same argument,

I think any action that we are forced to take

or kept from taking that caused us a monetary loss is
compensable.
Q

So, it just is not that some air space is being

taken.
MR. GRIBBON:
Q

In this particular case—

I know, but that is net—

MR. GRIBBON:

No, that is not the whole thing, no,

I think it is any governmental action of this landmark

18
designation nature»
Q

So, this would be a taking because the city

would be keeping you from making more profit, than you could by
using the same size building»
MR„ GRIBBON:
a part of our property»

I would put it because they are taking
They are taking a part of our

property right.
Q

You would make the argument even if it were

conceded-^—-which I am sure it is not—even if it were conceded
that the old building was profitable in the sense that you
were not losing any money on it.
MR. GRIBBON:
0

Yes, Your Honor.

If there were-—

If you could double what at least an accounting

would show you could make by using the building, you would say
they are taking part of your property?
MR» GRIBBON:
0

I think that is a fair statement, yes»

And that is your fundamental argument?

MR. GRIBBON:

It is based on the notion that the
.

reason they are doing it is to benefit the general public.

And

if we can show any loss under the taking cases, whether there
is an expectancy of profit here or whether it is a demolition,
then it should be compensable.

When they take three acres out

of a hundred acres of land, they do not look and say, "Well,
you can do pretty well on the other 97 acres."

They say, "We

have taken three acres, and we will give you the value of it."

19

And that, I submit, is precisely what we are faced with hare»
Q

Hr* Grihbon, back in 1911, one plan considered

was a 20-story tower on the property, was there not?
HR. GRIBBON:
Q

Over the terminal?

Yes.

MR. GRIBBON:
Q

Yes,

Yes, Your Honor.

Has anything

along that line been suggested

to

the commission here at this point?
MR. GRIBBON :

No, Your Honor, nothing that small

has been suggested simply because it would be an inefficient
utilization of land.

There are no other buildings really in

that area that have been built in recent days that wouldbuild
only that much floor space.

That is the problem in this

highly prized portion of the city, to get as much floor space
as is consistent with other needs.
has not been.

So, the answer is no, it

Although I must say there is not any suggestion

in the action taken by the Landmarks Commission that even that
would satisfy.

Nothing is going to satisfy

because they want

the air to' roam freely over Grand Central Station.
Q

Has there been a suggestion to the contrary,

the other way?
MR. GRIBBON:
Q

That 2f stories would not do?

Yes.

MR. GRIBBON:

No, there has not been, to my knowledge.

But. there has been no resilience in the Landmarks Commission,

20

with three efforts to do this under guidance of noted, people.
And the answer comes back no, no, no.

Every indication that

what is wanted is the preservation of Penn Central in its
pristine state, that that is the only way that the people of
New York and its visitors are goina to continue to enjoy
this architectural monument.
Q

Suppose 20 years aero, 30 years ago, before we

were as much concerned with the past as we are now, in
preserving the past, you had built over Penn Central Station,
without using any part of the station but just built over it
a 60 or 70 story hotel and the commission now decided that that
was marring the appearance, the esthetic value of this land­
mark and they wanted you to tear it down.

I suppose there is

not much doubt that you would expect compensation for that.
MR. ORIBBON:

Correct, Your Honor.

They could

condemn it or they could regulate it, and we would he entitled
to compensation.

But I think the power of the city is there.

And that is one of the things to be concerned about, that it is
there.
Q

Are you suggesting that there is no difference in

the taking aspect today in the present situation than in the
one I hypothesized?
MR. GRIBBON:

I do not think there should be, and I

do not perceive a difference.
be a taking-—

I would have thought that would

21

Q

In terms of Fifth Amendment principles.

MR. GRIBBON:

I would think that would clearly have

been a taking 20 years ago as well as today.
Q

Mr. Gribbon„ how did Penn Central or Grand
*
Central get that piece of land right in the middle of Park
Avenue?
MR. GRIBBON:
Q

There is a long history to it.

Did they receive it fair and square?

[Laughter]

Did they steal it fair and square?
MR. GRIBBON:

They did not steal it fair and square.

They acquired it over a long period of time, and indeed that
building there has done a great deal for the middle of New
York.

And which came first is pretty hard to say.
Q

It. sure does when you drive and you have to go

all the way around it.
MR. GRIBBON:
Q

[Laughter]
That is what the city wants to maintain.

Oh, I see.

MR. GRIBBON:

They acquired it over many years from

predecessor railroads largely.

And it is the Grand Central

Terminal now that we are talking about and not Penn Central.
That is wrong.
I submit that the most frequently applied consideration
in determining.when government regulation has resulted in a
compensable taking is simply stated one of fairness.

As this

Court observed in the Cors case, there is a strong element of

22
ethics in the constitutional requirements that private property
not be taken without compensation.

And time and again decisions

of this Court have reiterated that the overriding purpose of
the Fifth Amendment guarantee is to assure fairness in the
impact of government upon the owners of private property.

Back

in 1893, Mr. Justice Brewer, speaking for the Court, said the
Fifth Amendment prevents the public from loading upon one
individual more than his -just share of the burdens of govern­
ment.

Forty years later, Mr. Justice Brandeis, speaking for

the Court:

"Particular individuals may not be singled out to

bear the cost of advancing the public convenience."
In 3.960 the Court said the Fifth Amendment is designed
to bar the government from forcing some people alone to bear
public burdens which in all fairness and justice should be
borne by the public as a whole.
And just a few years ago in a decision by Mr. Justice
Rehnquist I think the essence of.these declarations was
captured in a statement that the Fifth Amendment derives as
much content from basic equitable principles of fairness as it
does from technical concepts of property loss.
These two taking guidelines that I have suggested
wou3_d appear to be opposite sides of the same coin.

Where you

are eliminating a use or a condition which is imposing a burden
on other people, it is fair to permit the person who is
charging that to take some expense, to take some burden, in

23
order to eliminate the burdens on the rest of the. people*

IIP''

On the other hand, where the government sets

out

to secure an improvement or a benefit for all society» perform­
ing what has been called its entrepreneurial or its resource
acquisition function, basic considerations of fairness dictate
that a disproportionate share of the cost of securing that
benefit not be borne or loaded on a single individual*
Significantly neither the Court of Appeals nor the
city and its supporting friends have anything to say about
this fairness concept, which has to be the lifeblood of the
Fifth Amendment»

Nothing they could say would alter the fact

that the full burden of the city's action in freezing the
terminal falls exclusively on Penn Central.

And it is being

called upon to bear a public burden -which, in all fairness and
justice, should be borne bv the public as a whole in order to
obtain the full and unimpeded enjoyment of the terminal.
1 turn now to the justification that the Court of
Appeals found for allowing the full cost of the terminal
preservation to be borne by Penn Central.

It made no inquiry

into taking and simply looked to see whether Penn Central had
established that it would be impossible—-and that is the word
of the court—for it to earn a reasonable return on the
terminal without utilizing the air rights.

It is our conten­

tion, of course, that whatever the remaining value of the
r-

terminal, we are entitled to compensation for that part that

24
has been taken.

But even if the remaining value of the term­

inal is to be given the critical significance that has been
accorded it by the court, that value was erroneously
ascertained.

In applying what it acknowledged to be a special

rule for landmark statutes, the court divided the value of
property into two separate ingredients-—that contributed by
private efforts and that contributed by the efforts of organized
society as a whole.

Then without attempting to ascertain how

much of the terminal * s value had been contributed by private
or society efforts, it concluded that Penn Central was not
entitled to any compenscition because it failed to establish
that there was not possibility that it could not earn a
reasonable return on the remaining and also unascertained pri­
vately contributed value of the terminal.
Q

As I read over the briefs filed by your

beothers and sisters on the other si^e, my impression is that
none of them really tried to defend the basic reasoning of the—
that part of the reasoning of the Court of Appeals; would you
agree with that?
MR. GEIBBON;
Mr. Justice Stewart.

I believe that is a fair statement,
That is the way I read those briefs.

They all back away to some degree and come forward with a
further explanation of why the decision should go against
Penn Central.

Q

The Court of Appeals really is a statement of

25
Henry George's single tax, is it not?
MR. GRIBBON:

Yes.

But 1 submit it is not a state­

ment of sound constitutional law, as many of Henry James'
things were, not necesscirily sound—
Q

George.

MR. GRIBBON:

George.

I am sorry.

James would be

different.
The co-art then went on, in addition to these two
ingredients of value, to impute a great deal of income, which
it did not quantify, to the terminal from other buildings in
the area.

And then, as if to put its position beyond all

argument, the court observed that the terminal may be capable
of producing a z-easonable return for its owners even if it can
never operate at a profit.

I submit that under no circum­

stances can the court's view of whether Perm Central is able to
earn a reasonable return on this property, absent the
development, rights, be accepted,

I think its effort to divide

property into these two segments really has no support in the
authorities.

depending upon social services, protection, and amenities.
If this approach were adopted, the government would

26

ba free to appropriate any property by giving only a pittance
of what that property is worth on the open market.
The error in the court's opinion is perhaps further
discosed in a passage near the end where it refers to the
city's financial distress and then says that in times of easy
affluence, preservation of landmarks through eminent domain
might be desirable or even required.

Surely, however, no

constitutional guarantee, particularly one based on the Fifth
Amendment, should be granted or denied, depending upon the
government's fiscal condition.
Q

Mr. Gribbon, down near the White House, across

the street from the Hay-Adams Hotel is an historic church.

I

suppose it goes back well over a hundred years, does it not?
MR. GRIBBON.*
Q

Saint John’s?

Saint John's Church.

I would assume*—and I think

you would assume with me—that the land underlying that church
is a very valuable piece of property for an office building or
another hotel or what not.

If that were taken—the church,

which presumably has fee title to that property--began
negotiations for the sale of it to the Hilton Hotel Corporation
or someone to build a hotel there and some effort was made by
the Congress to preserve it, would that be a taking, in your
view, if they said, "No, you cannot tear that down and build a
Hilton Hotel; you cannot do anything with it.

church would be entitled to compensation on the value of that
land and building.
Q

What if in that process, in that inquiry, it

developed that that church was the result of many, many
contributions by people, that the church corporation as such
did not ever put a single dollar into it—-it was all gift
money--would that make any difference?
MR. GRIBBON:

I do not think it v/ould.

I think

whoever held the title at that point would be entitled

to

the compensation.
Q

They would be entitled to get the compensation

for the highest and best use of that land as of today?
MR. GRIBBON:

That is a phrase that has been bandied

in the cases, and I am not too sure of the meaning.

I think

they would be willing to get what that property is worth, what
the Hilton Hotel would pay for it.
Q

Presumably at the moment the highest and best

use would be a hotel site.

applicable zoning law, and I take it it x-rauld be because there

—of Washington, D.C., 800 feet or some such.

MR. GRXBBON:

The same as everybody else is limited.

What an owner has invested in a piece of property is
really quite immaterial to what he gets when that property is
taken.

He may have an enormous investment, but he is not

going to get it back if the property is not worth that.

Or

he may have a fully depreciated investment so that the net is
zero; and yet it is the value.

It is the loss to that owner.

It is not really what is acquired or what the investment was
but the loss to the owner which is determinative.
As we discussed earlier here in my colloquy with
Mr. Justice Stewart, the city and its friends back away from
the Court of Appeals' rationale and attempt to salvage this
statute as being simply a form of land-use regulation or
zoning.

In the first place, there is not any general principle

that all land use regulation or all zoning is permissible and
does not constitute a taking.

This Court made that clear in

the leading case of Euclid y. Ambler.

The basis on which many

zoning laws have been upheld is that they represent a compre­
hensive regulatory program.

This Court has used the term

"comprehensive" in a number of recent decisions.

It has not

it raeans something close to the opposite of selective or highly
particularised.

superimposed, and it permits highly selective and particularised
actions.

The designation, for example, of the public library

or the Brooklyn Bridge or the Statue of Liberty as historic
landmarks does not mean anything.

The designation of a fine

eld home as an historic landmark may simply give the owner the
satisfaction of putting a brass plaque on the door to that
effect.
The recant designation of the Radio City Music Hall
interior as a landmark was followed very quickly by efforts by
the state and the city to put up about $2 million to keep the
show going for another /ear.
But it is the unpredictable nature and the highly
selective nature of what not only has been done but indeed what
the law contemplates.

And that is why the Court of Appeals

looked at this zoning and said, "No, sir, it cannot be zoning."
This really resembles discriminatory zoning, which has been
condemned, and it declined to condemn it because it was
1 istorical.
Q

Mr. Gribbon, may I interrupt with' a question?

When does the taking take place?

Supposing,, with respect to

t

the Chief Justice's example of the church, they had had no
negotiations with Hilton but the Congress decided that they

30

would designate it as an historic landmark today; they had no
deal on the fire or anything like that.

Would there be a

taking then, or would it only take place when they could show
that they had a better offer?
MR. GRIBBQNs

I would, think it would take place at

the former time.
Q

Then why do you say that putting a plaque on

the doer of a home is just a ceremonial act?

Why would not

Q

He is permitted to put it on.

Is he not equally forbidden to tear down the

MR. GRIBBQN:

That depends on what he can later work

cut with the Landmarks Commission, whether he can have
additions to it which will not impair the integrity of the
house, just as Penn Central attempted to do things that
would not impair the terminal.

The newer designation is just

the start of the game.
Q

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Koerner.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD J. KOERNER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. KOERNER:

Hr. Chief Justice Burger, may it

please the Court:
Appellants8 argument has proceeded from the approach
that the only method to regulate private property is by and
through the principles of eminent domain.
Q

I do not think so.

I think counsel very clearly

conceded the complete validity of all the zoning legislation
in New York City, at least for the purposes of this case.

32
MR* KOERNER:

Let me just establish the perimeter

of the appellants' argument»
0

You do not contend this is a zoning case, do

you?
MR. KOSRNER:

No.

What we contend is this is

another type of land-use regulation, with the very same tests
enunciated by this Court for all other land-use casas, what
is applied here.
Q

As applied to one particular unit?

MR. KOSRNER:

No.

This is the nub of the case.

The

appellant has proceeded with the assumption that Grand Central
Terminal has been singled out.

That analysis might be correct

if there had never bean a landmarks preservation law and in
response to an announcement by Penn Central that they were
going to build a building on top of Grand Central Terminal,
teat the public reacted to it and passed a law that distinc­
tively impacted or Penn Central.
V

Q

Do you contend it would be different from the

case you have now?
MR. KOERNER:

That is correct.

That is not what is

before the Court.
Q

How would it be different constitutionally?

MR, KOERNER:

In this particular' case we have a

aemprehensive land-use plan which sets out in advance the

criteria for determining whether or not a building is

33

architecturally or historically significant.

The intention of

the plan is to preserve all historical buildings, whether by
accident they are a part of historic districts or whether
they are single and outside the district.
0

What if the five boroughs got together and said

that there just is not much open space in the five boroughs,
and so we are going to preserve all the open space just as it
is even though it may be in private ownership;

Do you think

that would be constitutional?
MR. KOERNER:

It would depend on the strength—you

are saying without any—
Q

No, finding that there is a tremendous—

MR. KOERNER;

The answer would be no, because the

individual who was affected by the regulation would not be
getting any return on his property, nor would he be permitted
to use his property for any purpose.
Q

Supposing he was allowed to use it as open

No, because thcit would not be
And we do not contend that if the

appellant in this case had been able to establish that his
property as restricted was not economically viable, that he
would not be entitled to relief.
Q

they come and sit in the sunshine, they could pay a little
fee.

And he would raise enough to pay his taxes and maybe a

one percent, profit»
MR. KGERNER:

No, that would be insufficient.

The

test is whether or not the property, as restricted, is
economically viable.

It is the same test that has been

applied by this Court in other land-use cases.
Q

And it would not be enough for the landowner

to say, "I may be able to make a profit here the way it is,
but I couId make two or three times as much if you permitted
another use"?
MR. KGERNER:

That is correct, that the test is not

has been no taking in this case.

There

The appellant has not had

any out-of-pocket expense incurred.

What he has lost is the

potential to develop his property in the highest and best use.
Q

Do you not think that is a valuable right?

MR. KGERNER:

Yes, but it must be balanced against

the validity of the land-use regulation.
Q

Which is for the benefit of whom?

MR. KGERNER:

The entire community of which the

appellant is a part.
Q

But you do not think that the entire community

should bear the cost of the benefits for the entire community?

35
MR. KOERNER:

What I am saying is that the entire

community should pay the appellant if the restriction denies him
the right to earn a reasonable rate of return.

The problem

here is that everybody is trying to analogize this case to
zoning.

But it is a different type of land-use regulation,

the promotion of which has the same effect on the community
as does zoning, and that is to make the community more attrac­
tive.
Q

When you say reasonable rate of return, you

sound like it is a public utility.
MR. KOERNER:

No, it has traditionally been—we have

not quantified it except to the extent that it has been sug­
gested, that six percent would be reasonable.

But we never

got to a point in this litigation because there was a total
failure of proof.

The appellant was unable to show that he

could not make a profit.

That is precisely why we had the

trial in the state court.
Q

Suppose, instead of this being owned by the

Penn Central, this had been a private residence of areat
historic importance-—Commodore Vanderbilt9s house or some
such thing—and the Landmarks Commission wanted to take it.
MR, KOERNER:
Q

Designate it.

What kind of return do you have on a private

residence, to use the measurement that you are suggesting here?
MR. KOERNER:

In that case, the question is whether

36

or not a designation would interfere with the existing use.

To

the extent that the owner wanted to convert the private
residence to a commercial residence, then he would lie entitled
to show whether the property was economically viable.
Q

How about my hypothetical question to Mr. Gribbon

on Saint John's Church over by the Whits House, by Lafayette
Park:

Do you think Saint John’s Church could get the reasonable

market value of the land, less the cost of demolition?
MR. KQSRNER:

No,

if the designation did not inter­

fere with the use of the church as a church.

Since it is a

non-profit association, it would be our position that that
church could be maintained as part of an overall scheme to
preserve landmarks—
Q

Even if they wanted to do what the National

Presbyterian Church did, sell its downtown church for a very
large office building site and move out to the outskirts
where the parishioners could get to
MR. KQERNER:

church more readily?

If there was justification and they

could apply to the Landmarks Commission, and that would be in
a condition that would be considered by the commission.
Q

in fixing value?

MR. KOERNER:

Yes.

That is not involved in this

particular case.
Q

Is the Landmarks Commission qualified to deal

with due process?

37
MR» KOERNER:
0

Mo.

The Landmarks—

Are you not giving it that business?

MR, KOERNER:

No.

What I an saying is that they

have set. up a procedure to determine which properties are
historically significant.
Q

They have set up criteria-—

You say it is not a zoning commission.

MR. KOERNER:

It is like a zoning commission to the

extent that—
Q

But a minute ago you said, "Oh, no," you were

not going to get into the zoning business.

I thought that is

Vihat you said.
MR. KOERNER:
Q

No.

What I said—

Now are you going into zoning?

MR. KOERNER:

No.

What I am saying, that in both

zoning and landmarks you have expert commissions charged with
the responsibility of developing a comprehensive land-use
scheme, the purpose of the scheme to benefit the community.
What I am saying is that with respect to—
0.

And l.assume that that commission knows how to

operate a railroad terminal?
MR. KOERNER:

No.

The commission determines whether

the railroad terminal fits under the criteria before it, that
is, whether it is architecturally and historically significant.
Cnee it is designated, if i: imposes a hardship—that is, if
it denies the appellant a reasonable rate of return or makes--

38

Q

Who makes that determination?

MR. KQERNER:

The cot rt in this case made that

determination after a lengthy trial.
Q

I am talking about the commission by itself.

Do they make that determination?
MR. KOERNER:
Q

There is a procedure within—

I understood that two or three times Penn

Central went there, trying to work this out.
MR. KOERNER;
Q

No.

Am I right?

Penn Central-—

They did not go to it?

MR. KOERNER;

No,

They had applied to the commission

for the right to knock down Grand Central Terminal and put up
an office building.

The question was whether or not that

application was appropriate for the purpose of effectuating
the chapter, the statute.

And the Landmarks Commission

properly determined that it would not be appropriate.

Penn

Central did not choose to litigate that issue in a court
proceeding,

Indeed., they have not chosen to litigate the

Timewise, they could do it on a building that

was 80 years old?
MR. KOERNER:

Yes, that is correct.

But the built-in

safeguard is that if the owner of the subject property is
unhappy with the desicmation, he can bring a special proceeding
in the Supreme Court and challenge the designation on the
basis of arbitrariness and capriciousness.

One of the

factors in considering whether there has been a deprivation of
clue process-—
Q

I assume that is true of all state commissions.

MR. KOERNER:
Q

That is correct.

So, it is nothing new, especially for this

commission.
MR. KOERNER:

That is precisely our point, that this

is a land-use regulation that has the same effect as any other
land-use regulation.
Q

What if in that proceeding the court decides

that the commission was absolutely ricrht, no one can dispute

40
that this is a historical landmark; is that the end of it?
MR. KOERNER:
designation is proper.

No, because all that says is that the

property economically unviable is the type of issue that was

standard do they use?

Whether or not the property as

restricted is being precluded of all reasonable beneficial use.
I want to point out that-—
0

You mean not of all economic use but some

profitable—MR. KOERNER:

That is correct.

But what they do

determine is what this Court has constantly reiterated, that
when the police power is properly exercised—and., by the way,
tiers is no dispute that this is a proper subject for the
ecercise of the police power--that the highest and maximum use
is not a necessary goal, that it is presumed that that goal
can be withdrawn when you exercise the police power.

That is

a necessary iy-product,
Q

Did they set a percentage of return on initial

investment like a public utility?
MR., KOERNER;

No,

they did not do that because in

t.iis particular case there was such a failure of proof they
did not have to quantify it.

41
Q

You say as this case comes to us, we must judge

it on the basis that Grand Central in its present use is
profitable?
MR. KOERNER:

Must be.

And that, Your Honor, is the

essence of this case, and that the appellant has ignored the
lengthy trial and the two findings of the appellate court.
Q

Mr. Koerner, Grand Central is still used by the

railroads for passenger service.
MR. KOERNER;
Q

That is correct.

Let us assume that the Interstate Commerce

Commission allo-wed the station to be closed for rail service
on the ground that not enough people use it for that purpose
and assume further that no other use of the building in its
present condition is deemed feasible.
MR. KOERNER:
Q

Right.

What would your position be with respect to that

situation?
MR. KOERNER:

Fanri Central would be entitled to

relief because the propertfts restricted was not economically
viable.
Q

Is that clear from, the New York law?

MR. KOERNER:

Yes, it is.

Yes.

And I again want to

emphasize the attempt by the appellant to ignore the substantial
factual data presented during the trial.
Q

Is there a specific section of the New York law

«

42
that deals with that situation?
MR. KOERNER:

In this particular case it came under

the guise of a challenge to the application as a deprivation of
due process.

To answer your question, it was framed in response

to a due process issue raised in court.

With respect to other

challenges internally through the administrative process, we
allow for an application for a certificate of appropriateness.
That is, even to the extent of demolishing the landmark parcel
if it is not economically viable.
Q

That is not in the statute—

MR. KOERNER:
Q

No, it is in the statute.

It is?

MR. KOERNER:

But Penn Central was a tax-exempt

property, and the statute did not have this exception applicable
to a tax-exempt property.

So, Penn Central sued in court, and

it attempted to prove in court what they could not prove
before the commission.
Q

In any event-—

MR. KOERNER:
Q

It is the same test.

—similar to the question that my Brother Powell-

if the company at any time in the future, next year or the year
after that, any time it can prove that the situation has
changed and that the property is no longer economically
viable, it will get relief.
MR. KOERNER:

That is precisely the answer.

That is

43
right»
Q

What again is the definition of being econom­

ically viable?
MR. KOERNER:
in this case.

It was not required to be quantified

But it has traditionally meant that on his

investment, he would be able to earn approximately a six
percent-—
Q

Like a public utility.

MR. KOERNER:
Q

Correct.

Supposing that the New York Central Railroad

is applying to the Railroad Rate Commission in New York for
an intrastate fare change and the commission decides that you
can make six percent, which we consider a reasonable rate,
without a spur track of three miles, which you presently own.
Sc, we are just going to take that three-mile spur track
away from you.

You will still make six percent on the total

investment you have.
MR, KOERNER;

Do you think you could do that?
No, because I do not see the strength

of the public purpose in. that particular case.
Q

Supposing they want the spur track as a railroad

museum to show how the 20fch century used to look.
MR. KOERNER:

Then again the answer to Your Honor's

question is that in your application, you are singling out
that particular railroad and restricting its development of its
property.

The entire concept of this scheme is that we are not

44
singling out Penn Central.

We are treating it like every othe

landmark within the City of New York.

Indeed* before a designation is completed,

that designation has to be approved by the City Planning
Commission, which must determine whether it is consistent
with the zoning plan and the master plan and whether or not
any urban renewal development might interfere.
Q

Mr. Koerner, eculd 1 return for a moment to

Justice Powell's question about economic viability of a
demolition or something like that?
MR. KOERNER;

Yes.

As I understood

the statute, the statutory

test of whether to grant a certificate of appropriateness
does not say anything at all about economic viability.

MR. KOERNER;

There are two bases for certificate

With respect to Penn Central, because of

t:ie tax-exempt property, you are correct, that they could not
have gotten a certificate of appropriateness administratively
because the economic viability question is not allowed since
they were tax exempt.

With respect to other commercial

properties, a certificate of appropriateness can be granted.

that the property was not economically viable,

MR. KOERNER;

That is correct.

issue in this case because Penr Central had the opportunity to
establish under the very same test and failed.
Q

Mr. Koarnerf I citi a little confused about, your

references to tax exemption.
MR. KGERNER:

What specifically is tax exempted?

The railroad does not have to pay full

city real estate, taxes on the terminal.

There is an exemption

under the railroad law for that portion of the terminal that is
used for railroad purposes so that they only pay approximately
one-third the assessed valuation.
Q

Would the theory be that they are taxed in other

ways or—
MR. KOERNER:

It was intended to encourage them to

keep up the railroad system.
Q

Does it make any difference to the constitutional

issues in this case whether they were totally tax exempt or paid
tie full tax that everyone else pays?
MR.. KOERNER:
Q

No.

So. in this respect they are in the same posture

as Saint John's Church?
MR. KOERNER:

That is correct, with the exception that

here though you can equate their business with whether or not
they can make a reasonable rate of return,

and one thing

wo have left out—my time is running out, but I want to
emphasize one other factor that is quite important.

Wa have

concentrated on the restriction of Grand Central Terminal and

47
whether that restriction imposes on them an extraordinary
burden not present when other land-use regulation impacts on
a parcel.

What we have left out and the appellant has not

commented on are the air rights.

We have never contended that,

the transfer development rights were equal in value to what the
t

person lost.

But that is not the test.

The test is whether

the transfer development rights constituted a valuable asset
to the appellant, that when added to his return on the railroad,
which he was unable to establish, whether that salsfied even
the appellant's test of fairness.

And I want to briefly

mention the evidence that was upheld by the two appellate
courts.
Q

Mr. Koerner, before you do that, let me just

understand your theory.

If there is no taking here, you would

not even have to give them the-—
MR. KOERNER?
Q

That is correct.

Then why do we have to consider?

MR. KOERNER?

Because the air rights are part of the

comprehensive scheme and an attempt to at least "recognise that
we are going to try to do everything we can-Q

Maybe you have been more generous than the

Constitution compels you to be.

Why does that have any

r elevance at all to what we have to decide?

Q

But nobody is defending his rationale.

MR. KOERNER:

No.

[Laughter]

To the extent that he relied on the air rights, it
was appropriate to consider the air rights in the context of
the whole package to determine exactly whether we have been fair,,
Q
been fair?

What difference does it make whether you have
I do not understand your angle.

MR. KOERNER:

Because the fairness concept, advocated

by the the appellant, goes to the concept of due process in
determining value.

Our plan contemplates giving the indiv'dual

designee this.
Q

But your legal position is you do not have to be

fair.
MR. KOERNER:
Q

No, that is not our legal position.

Your position, as I understand it, is there can

be a taking sometimes under this—MR. KOERNER:

That is correct.

But there has not been

i:i this particular case.
Q

That is right.

MR. KOERNER:

And that the facts and circumstances of

this particular case show there had not. been.

I will only take

one; more minute.
With respect to the air rights, the testimony at trial
showed that the proposed builder, UPG, had offered Penn Central
$1.8 million a year for the rig!it to develop air rights over

49
the Biltrnore Hotel, an eligible receiving site under the transfer
development, rule.

Penn Central’s representative testified that

3.8 was insufficient because it wanted five million.
the five million as follows.

It was guaranteed three million if

it developed the air rights above the terminal.
its profit

It computed

from the Biltrnore was two million.

In addition,
So, to get the

same deal that it would have had with respect to building
over Grand Central Terminal, it concluded that it had to receive
five million.
I urge that, this is not the issue before the Court.
The issue is not whether or not Penn Central was entitled to the
highest and best use, the five million.

The issue is whether or

not the $3.8 million return, by using the Biltrnore site,
together with their failure to establish that the property as
restricted cannot earn a reasonable rate of return, is so
uifair as to really in all effects totally emasculate the land

Let me ask just one more question.

I know you

But if the transfer rights are

of equal value, or substantial equal value, could we not hold
that there was a taking and then on retrial they find that there
was just compensation?
MR. KOERNER:
Q

Wo.

You could go ahead with your program without

any interference.
MR. KOERNER:

No, because 1 do not. think the transfer

rights were of equivalent value.

Argument

Mrs. Wald.

of mrs. patricia m. wald

ON BESIALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MRS. WALD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The United States has a vital interest in these pro­
ceedings today.

Congress and the Executive have declared in

many statutes that it is a national policy that, quote, "his­
torical and. cultural foundations of the nation should be

preserved as a living part of our community life and development:
in order to give our people a sense of orientation."
The Federal Government is deeply involved in historica:!
preservation in many ways , and I will allude to them only
briefly.

Number one, it designates and preserves historic

landmarks on its own public land.

Two, it sometimes utilizes

the power of eminent domain to acquire sites of national
historic significance.

Number three, since 1966, it maintains

a National Registry of Historic Buildings

which have local,

state, city, and national significance, and now contains 15,000
such buildings.
Fourth, it provides financial aid to states and cities
so that they can survey their historic preservation problems,
formulate plans, and embark on preservation projects to preserve
their fcreasures.
And, fifth, all federal agencies, pursuant to the
1966 act and to an Executive order, who license projects or
spend money on projects in any state, must take account of the
need to preserve historic sites which are registered or which
are eligible for registration.
Finally, there are several very specific enactments,
including the National Environmental Protection Act, which

-

requires NEPA impact statements to assess the impact of
historic sites that might be affected by proposed projects.
Q

Mrs. Wald, may I just interrupt because it goes

52

to what you are reciting now?
MRS. WALD:
O

Yes.

Has the United States ever imposed a regulation

on private use of private property for historic purposes
without compensating the owner?
MRS. WALD:
Q

I do not believe it has directly done so.

So, it has never done anything comparable to

what we have before us?
MRS. WALD:

Not to my knowledge.

But may I add that i

does provide subsidization to local groups who embark upon some
%

of their projects, pursuant to laws like the New York City
landmark law which use a regulatory framework for preservation-Q

Is it fair to say that the federal policy has

always been that where there is a public benefit, the public
shall pay?
MRS. WALD:

I believe that that is an overstatement,

for the following reason.

Naturally the Federal Government has

relied primarily upon state and local governments and their
police power and their particular historic preservation laws
to bring about the preservation of buildings except where those
biildings are on public land.
However, we do have several instances, not for
historic preservation but for other uses, which raise a similar
question where the Federal Government through its regulatory
powers does in fact impose restrictions upon land use which it

53
does not compensate for by eminent domain.

In the area of

historic preservation, to xay knowledge, you are correct.
Justice Stevens, but we do not do it directly,
Q

Suppose a farmer up near Manassas is suddenly

informed that the records now discover that an important part of
the Battle of Manassas was fought on his farm and, therefore,
they will let him graze his cows and raise some grain but that
ha cannot sell it.

It is just going to be preserved for the

benefit of the whole people,

Eo you mean to suggest that they

do not have to pay him the going rate per acre for that farm?
MRS, WALD:

If we are referring now, as I believe you

are, to the national government—
Q

Yes,

MRS, WALD:

---taking such action, then right now the

national government would either have to do it through eminent
domain or through a state or a local government which had
jurisdiction.

We do not have sny statutes on the books, to my

knowledge, which allow us to have a national historic preserva­
tion regulatory framework such as the states and cities.

That

is not to say, Your Honor, and certainly we do not have the
question before us today, that it would not be possible for
Congress to enact, such—
Q

Yes.

The Chief Justice’s question was a

constitutional question because that is what we have in this
case, not whether or not you happen to have at the moment a

54
federal statute.
MRS. WALD:

That is right.

It is always very

hazardous to pass on constitutional questions ahead of time.
Q

That is what we have to do in this case.

[Laughter]
MRS. WALD:

You are passing on a statute of course that

is on the books in New York City.

If the Federal Government,

pursuant to a federal jurisdiction, passed such a statute, I
believe that it is possible it would be constitutional.
Q

Without compensation?

MRS. WALD:

Without compensation in the sense that it

vould be subject to the same test which we s;uggest constitu­
tionally applies to state and local government.
eo

If it became

onerous to the landholder, if he could not take any beneficial

uses out of his property, then it would become a taking, and it
would be unconstitutional.
Q

The beneficial uses that my farmer friend up at

Manassas has in mind is to leave it to his children or to sell
it, as the case may be.
in some places now.

And he can get $1,500 an acre for it

Are you suggesting the United States

Government or any government could take that property without
paying him the going rate?
MRS. WALD:
Mr. Chief Justice.

I am not suggesting that they take it,
I am suggesting that a valid historical

landmark statute could allow them to restrict its usage so that

55
a particular historic framework, a particular historic use,
V70uld not be violated.

Q

If he had had an offer to sell it to the super­

market, Landmark Supermarket, would that be the price?
The Grand Central Supermarket.

[Laughter]

Would that be the

price he would have to be paid?
MRS. WALD:

I air, sorry, I air* not sure I understand

your question, Justice Marshal'..
Q

I am putting just one little point into the

Chief Justice’s plot.
hogs there.

Now they have got the cattle and the

The Grand Central Supermarket has come to him,

and they want to build a huge Xandmall there, and they will
give him $2,500 an acre.
MRS. WALD:

Is that the price?

Is that the price you suggest that the

government would have to pay?
Q

Yes.

MRS. WALD:

Yes.
I believe that the Federal Government

could indeed enact a statute which would not require them to
pay the price you suggest, the going rate on the market for the
land, simply because they had restricted uses so as to prevent
him from selling it to the supermarket.
Q

I want to get beck to the hypothetical that I

gave Mr. Gribbon and see what your answer is.

The National

Presbyterian Church, which is surely an historic place on
Connecticut Avenue.

Out in front of the building was the

statute of John Witherspoon, one of the signers of the
Declaration, I think.

And they contracted to sell it for three

or four million dollars.

Suppose after they contracted to sell

it in order to build a new church further out and had this
three or four million dollar contract, the District of Columbia
had said, "No, that is going to be a landmark.
it."

You cannot sell

How you have got the going market value fixed by a

contract, an arm's length contract, with the, I think, National
Broadcasters Association to put the building up there.

Do you

suggest the District of Columbia, under any statute, could have
taken that property without paying them for it?
MRS. WALD?

I do suggest that the District of

Columbia could have passed a regulation which required, after
designation, through a reasonable mechanism of that church as
an historical site, that indeed

either that site must be

maintained, the church must be maintained, or if it were sold,
tie successor must maintain it in the church form.

And I

believe that a somewhat similar case—
Q

You would not say that if it were sold for $10

or whatever the buyer would pay and then he just closed down
the church.

You could not make him operate the church.

You

would not suggest that, would you?
MRS. WALD:
Q

Ho, 1 would not suggest—

And the city hers would indicate that if they

ceased operating as a church, iwould no longer be appropriate

57
to restrict the use without compensation.
MRS. WALD:

I would suggest that since the property

was originally—-its original use, its present use at the time
it was designated, was as a church—-that indeed nobody can be
made obviously to operate a church if they do not want to.

But

I think what can be done is to restrict other uses of the
property.
Q

In the Grand Central case, are you differing

with your colleague that if Penn Central just shut the terminal
down, that it would still be required to leave the building as
it is?
MRS. WALD:

Certainly I believe that the statute is

•valid and under the statute, if it wished to shut down the
station, to cease operating, tc demolish the-—
Q

They cease opere.ting and then they go in before

the commission and say, "We are not making a nickel on this.
Unless we can do something witr it, we cannot even pay cur
tares on it, reduced as they are."

I thought your colleague

indicated that then they could tear it down or at least if they
were going to have to leave it standing, they would have to be
aid for it.
MRS. WALD:

I believe that the courts—-although it is

not in the statute in Granc Central's case—but I believe that
thr courts, the Kew York courts, in that situation, if they did
not want to operate it at all, would indeed permit them to

58
cease operating it»

But I am not sure that it would permit them

to go ahead and make another use of the property.
Q

The point is , ir the event hypothesized by my

Brother White, would the Constitution then require that compensa
tion be paid?
MRS. WALD:

1 do not believe that the Constitution

requires compensation be paid simply because they decided they
did not want to operate it anymore as a railroad station.

I

believe that they would be—before a taking arid compensation
would be required, under existing law they would be required
to find some beneficial use, tc attempt to find some beneficial
use that did not violate the nature of the preservation law.
And I believe in fact that is what most of the cases this Court
has held in the past would suggest.
For instance, in the loldblatt case, the case that
candidly the ordinance completely prohibited the use, the
excavation pit use, to which tha property had been put before.
That was completely ruled out.

Yet the Court held that was not

a taking because the plaintiff night well find some other uses
for the property, or there had not been any showing that he
could not.
There have been cases in which—the South Terminal
case in Boston where the EPa simply said in its regulations,
in its transportation plan, "You may not use ^-percentage of
parking space because , if you d5, it will affect the air,"

59

Clean Air Act.

And the Court, there held, first, that that was

not a taking because, even though you could not use those spaces
for parking spaces, for which they had originally been intended,
you had to look around and find some other uses, less valuable-—
Q

Mrs. Wald, is your test then,just applying it to

the historic landmark area, if the landmark designation causes
the property owner to actually lose money on the property, then
at the taking, if he can still make a reasonable return, it is
not taking?

Is that your test?

MRS. WALD:

That is pretty much the test.

it is a test of the past cases here.

I think

I think it is more if

there is a profitable use to the property.

There has been a

taking—-and there have been innumerable takings—
Q

Is it just one penny of profit or a reasonable

MRS. WALD:

Certainly the cases dc not tell us in the

Q

We have to decide.

MRS. WALD:

—they set no set formula as a reasonable

return or a beneficial use.
So, you just say just a marginal profit would not foe
enough.

It has to be a reasonable return.
MRS. WALD:

I would say a reasonable return is a

beneficial use.
Q

If it is a lot less than could be obtained by putting it to some
ether use, is it still reasonable?

Q

Most recently:-"

But you do not think the test is the least

profitable use either?
MRS. WALD:

I certainly believe the Constitution

would require the owner, if he could not use. it for a particu­
lar purpose, to be able to go cut and find the most profitable
ise consistent with the point of the regulation, namely, the
preservation of the landmark.
Q

You mean you art going to make him do something

with it?
MRS. WALD:

No, we are going

to permit him to do

something with it if he wants to.
Q

What if he just wants to board it up?

MRS. WALD:

If he warts to board it up and that does

rot in some way infringe upon the historical preservation aspect,
cf the property, then he could do that.

If the historical

reservation simply says it is a beautiful church to look at
from the outside and we do not care what happens, whether anybody
goes in it or anything else, then he can just leave it stand
there if he wants to.
to run it as a church—

On the other hand, if he wants to continue

61

Q

Who should pay the $10,000 a year insurance

premiums on. it and public liability in the meantime?
MRS. WALD:

Well, the church may be the wrong example.

But the owner continues with all of both the liabilities and
the profits of ownership.

But any owner has certain options

about how to use his property.
Q

What profit have you got on a boarded up

building?
MRS. WALD:

If you boarded it up by your own choice,

then—
Q

No, boarded it up because the government, from

jour point of view, would not let him sell it, not let them
sail it.
MRS. WALD:

In most of these cases, the sale—indeed,

in the case instance here in the New York law, they do not
forbid the sals per se.
which is restricted.

They only forbid the sale for a use

So, indeed, many of the cases in which

the courts have held there is no taking at a reasonable
regulatory use, they point out that it leaves the option with
the owner as to whether or not he wants to sail or lease it or
use it for other purposes.

All of these cases, if I may finish

the one sentence, all of the land-use cases have pointed out
that it is almost inevitable, starting with Justice Holmes
back in the Kohl case, that when the government pursues a
police power for a legitimate end, it will likely end up with

62
a diminution of value of land and the restriction of use.
unless that becomes so onerous

as

And

to move over into a taking”"

and where that line is drawn the courts have over the years said
is very difficult—-that it is a reasonable use of the police
power.

And I think the rule which appellant would suggest,

that any time there is a loss in value of property due to a
reasonably valid regulation, use of the police power, that the
owner must be emopensaced, is indeed a radical, revolutionary
rule which just simply has no foundation in the past cases of
the police power or indeed in the taking cases themselves.
MR. JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Gribbon?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. GRIBBON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. GRIBBON:

If I may briefly, Mr. Chief Justice,

I should like to answer Mr. Justice Marshall's inquiry and make
clear that Penn Central did make an effort with the Landmarks
Commission to obtain a certificate of appropriateness and no
exterior effect.

And in the Landmarks Commission there was never

any attention paid to dollars.
determination.

That was strictly an esthetic

The only time economic loss came into the pic­

ture was when the case went, into court.

And then instead of

inquiring as to whether there was a taking and making a
determination, which is not terribly complex in this case as to
the value of what was taken, the courts went off on this

63
economic inquiry into reasonable return which, as you read the
Court of Appeals' opinion, we were bound to lose»

There was no

way to win under the way the Court of Appeals analyzed this
economic problem,
Q

Mr, Gribbon, what if in passing this ordinance—

was it an ordinance?
MR, GRIBBONi
Q

What was it?
The landmarks law, yes, Your Honor,

What if they had done their homework before they

passed the ordinance and said the following landmarks are hereby
designated right in the ordinance, and they did 30 of them or
40, so that you ware not singled out at all. They thought they
*

had spotted all the landmarks in town.
MR, GRIBBON:

I think if the economic impact on us

was the same ultimately, as it is here, the fact that they were
dasignated in the law rather than designated by the commission
wauld be immaterial.
Q

But you would not be singled out.

Well, singled out—certainly we are

Q

As I heard this argument it is now the issue-—as

I understand your opponent, he concedes that there might be
occasions and circumstances under which the operation of this
ordinance did operate so as to be a taking in the constitu­
tional sense»

And you concede, with respect to the Status of

Liberty or the tree in Brooklyn, that there might be occasions
when it did not so operate.

And the question then is, Doss

MR, GRIBBON s
Q

Yes.

MR. GRIBBON:

Do you agree that v?e have got the case on the

assumption that the station is a sustainable economic opera­

No, I do not think so, Your Honor.

bacause-—
Q

Did you disprove it?

I thought there was the

finding that it was, as they say, economically viable.
MR. GRIBBON:

I say tie Court of Appeals finding to

tiat effect is totally erroneous because it is based on this
concept that we need only earn a return on the privately
contributed ingredients.
Q

That destroys the entire finding.

Let us assume fo? the moment that we accept it,

that it is economically viable, but nevertheless it is

perfectly obvious you could make more if you built a big
building cn it.
MR. GRIBBONs

I still say even if you accept it, the

decision is wrong, and we are entitled to compensation.

I do

not think the fact that what we have left over is atonement
for what has been taken from us.
Q

In your brief at page 17 you cite this Court’s

opinion in Puller where you say that the government in a
condemnation case cannot exclude from consideration of the jury
the value that may be added by the fact that the government
built a post office near the site 80 years ago.

Is that

substantially your argument here.
MR. GRIBBON:

I think chat is a very

things.

Second, his entire property was not

The Court noted that.

But the

'compensation was because he was prevented from doing that.
The Court also said that on expected use of a property is

66
properly to be taken into account in making a

valuation for

O

The expected use, is that what you said?

MR, GRIBBON:
Q

That is what I said, an expected use.

How is that different from the highest and best

MR. GRIBBON:

I am not sure how it is different.

I

think it makes more sense because an expected use is clearly an
element of value.

That is why people buy7 it, for what they

I think the highest and beneficial use is

a

term that has really outlived its usefulness, if it ever had
any, because I think the cases stand for the proposition that
you get compensation for what has been taker., whatever the
value.
Q

Is that term obsolete when a church could show

that it has a contract to sell the church and the site for
$4-1/2 million?

Does that not give some evidence of the

highest and best use?
MR. GRIBBON:

I would put it under ter as of expected

use.
Q

The highest and best use might be to sell it as

a slaughterhouse for $8,000, which the zoning would prevent.
MR. GRIBBON:

The zoning would prohibit, but for a

legitimate use.
Q

The highest and bast use always is restrained

67

by municipal use.
HR. GRIBBON:

The Solicitor General recognizes that a

statute such as this landmarks law creates unusual opportun­
ities for arbitrary action.

And the remedy is not in judicial

review of the landmarks designation.

Those who own property

that is coveted for public use are rarely, if ever, going to
be a majority at the polls or in law-making bodies.

And the

only effective discipline on government acquisition of private
resources is that provided by the pocketbook.

Only if the

elected representatives and their designees are required to
make a cost-benefit analysis and pay through the taxes what
they are going to acquire from private people for public
use is there any protection for private property against everexpanding government acquisition of private resources.
Q

What if you have a regulation put down by OSHA

that puts down a number of safety standards, and the owner
says, "I simply cannot run the business with all these safety
standards"; does that mean he has a claim of talcing or is that
simply a question of a regulation that forces an individual
oic of business like Brandeis's dissent in Mayheinter?
MR.

GRIBBON;

It may be.

If the representatives

have decided that those OSHA requirements are necessary to do
away with hErr, that may be a price that the individual owner
has to pay.

But I suggest

a difference between that when the

government goes out in a resource acquisition capacity, as it

68
.is doing here, as it did in the case- of the Gettysburg
Battlefield many years ago, and where the government did pay
eminent domain for it.
Thank you, Your Honor.

Q

In the Cansby case the air space above a minimum

safe altitude was not deemed compensable, was it?
MR, GRIBBON:

Above--yes, that is right, Your Honor.

It would be interference with the use.

And, as I said, they

could take into account an expected use, and that is actually
what we are doing here, a recognizable expected use of a small
building—

But there it was impact on the use of the land
