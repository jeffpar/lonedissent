Mr, Moorman, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF O'AMES W. MOORMAN, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MOORMAN %

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court s
The Gila National Forest was created by a series of
Presidential proclamations issued between 1899 and 1910 which
reserved certain public lands in New Mexico from entry.

The

in this case is whether under the doctrine of reserve water
rights those reservation proclamations also reserved waters of
the Rio Mimbres for the needs of the Gila National Forest for
in-stream flows for fish and wildlife, for stock watering and
for recreation.
The cat© began before a Special Master appointed by
the State District Court in New Mexico who concluded that the
United States did indeed have such water rights for those pur­
poses.

The State District Court disagreed with the Special

Master at the objection of the State of New Mexico and held
first that the United States did not have a reserve water right
for recreation purposes within the forest? secondly, the State
District Court held that the United States did not have reserved
water rights for stock watering purposes within the national

4
forest and thereby leaving grazing permittees to obtain what­
ever rights they could under state law? thirdly, the State
District Court held that the United States could not have a
reserved water right for in-stream flow in Bio Mimbres for
those or any other purposes? and, fourthly, the District Court
without comment deleted from the Master’s proposed decree a
water right for wildlife,,

Well, how can -the in-flow issue aver be

Because if it just doesn’t

MR, MOORMANs
QUESTION%

Well, ws think —

So how come that issue is in the case?

MR. MOORMANs

Well, we have wondered in this case why

it was challenged by Mew Mexico, but we do believe that *—
QUESTION:

Challenged, the only reason it would be

challenged is that you claimed it.
MR. MOORMANS
QUESTION %

That’s correct.

Well, why would you claim it in this case?

MS. MOORMANs

Becuase we are required, we believe, to

clairs» all of the water rights which we claim for fh© national
forest in this proceeding.
right new

So if we did not claim the water

we would be forever foreclosed from claiming it

later.
QUESTION:

Well, that is a -tough question, but why

would it ever arise hero?

Who could ever possibly interfere

with your in**stream flow?
MR. MOORMAN-:'

A later appropriator upstream in an

in-holding might.
•QUESTION s

So that is what you are really, worried

about?
MR, MOORMANsQUESTION %

Yes, Your Honor.

But you own way to the cres t.

MR. MOORMANs

Well, but of course we are interested

in in-stream flow below the crest.

There are in-holdings in

the forest above the points in th© —

QUESTIONs

Do you mean fee title land?

MR. MOORMAN %
QUESTION?

Yes, Your Honor.

But I thought you said there weren’t any

upsfcreara users.
MR. MOORMAN?

They are not users but there are pri­

vate lands upstream which could be points of diversion.

In

addition to that, someone —
QUESTION %

They could transfer the water elsewhere?

MR. MOORMANS
QUESTION s

That is correct.

Except you would never let thorn do it

across your property? across the national forest.

They would

have to got your permission.
MR, MOORMANs

Well, but of course if we didn’t have

a water right, we would have no basis for denying them a right"
of-way, Your Honor.
QUESTION %

Well, your in-stream flow claim goes

againr t down-stream appropriators who are prior in time to the
national forest proclamation.
MR. MOORMANs

I believe that the in-stream flow. Your

Honor, would be a great benefit to all the down-stream appro­
priators , junior or senior, because it is a non-consumptive use
of water,
QUESTION t

But some of them probably don’t -think so.

MR. MOORMAN*

I doubt that, Your Honor, because I am

sure they want in-stream flows to reach them.

7
QUESTIONS

Well, this goes against upstreamers.

MR, , MOQRMANs

The people who would complain about in-

stream flows generally would be upstream junior appropfiators.
QUESTION s

Yes.

MS. MOORMANS
QUESTION?

Yes.

Straighten me out in my geography.

Does

the Mimbres flow into the Rio Grande?
MR. MOORMAN

%

I t does not.

It flows down into the

desert and it'ends somewhere north of the Mexican border.

It

is not really tributary to any other stream.
QUESTION %

But the Gila flows into the Colorado?

MR. MOORMANj
QUESTION s

The Gila does, yes, Your Honor.

That is on the other side of the divide

then?
MR. MOORMANs

So I understand.

The Supreme Court of New Mexico affirmed the District
Court, holding specifically that the United States does not
have any rights to maintain an in-stream flow in the Rio
Mimbres and in addition specifying that the United States does
not have reserved*rights for the purpose of stock watering and
recreation.
The New Mexico Supreme Court reached this holding be­
cause it concluded that the purposes for which the United
States claimed reserve rights from the Rio Mimbres for the Gila
National Forest were not within the purposes for which a forest

8

could he established under the Organic Administration Act of
1897.

Under that Act, in the New Mexico Court's view, a

national forest can only be established for the two purposes
of supplying timber or supplying water for down-stream appropriators.

The Maw Mexico Court reasoned that the reservation

of land for the Gila National Forest could not have reserved
water rights for stock watering or recreation, as those were
not the purposes of the reservation.
The New Mexico Court also held that the United States
could not reserve an in-stream flow for any purpose.

The

specific present rights which the United States seeks in the
Mimbres are set forth at pages 192 and 193 of the appendix.
There is set forth 91.18 acre-feet of consumptive use mostly
for stock watering.

There are also listed a few rights there

on page 192 and 193 for domestic recreation, which is another
word, for camp ground.

There is one small right listed for a

tenth of an acre-foot for wildlife.

In addition, there are

some rights listed for matters not in contention here for stock
watering and residential, and that would be the ranger's home
or a fire tower.

Also listed are the three non-consumptive

in-flow stream rights of three cubic-feet — of two cubic-feet
per second each.
The Special Master's report also provided that the
United States could have a year to present

additional claims

for the future needs of the forest if the United States chose

9
to do so.

Because the District Courthowever, ruled as a

matter of law that the United Statas could not have most of
the rights it sought here, and because the United States ap­
pealed that ruling, the time never arrived for the United
States to submit any evidence of future needs.

However, if we

prevail here today, Your Honors, we will submit evidence of
some additional consumptive us® but no additional in-stream
flow use.
QUESTIONS

Your in-stream flow claim is bounded on

the downward aide of the river by the boundary of the national
forest?
MR. MOORMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

It would be measured

at three locations.
QUESTION:

But would any of them be below the lower

boundary of the national forest?
MR. MOORMAN;

No, Your Honor.

The governing law of

this case, the doctrine of reserved water rights is not in
dispute.

It rests on a long line of decisions of this Court.

Reserved water rights are often referred to as Winters rights,
after the leading decision of this Court in 1908 in the United
States v. Winters, which first fully enunciated the doctrine.
QUESTIONS

Was it a long line of opinions?

[Laughter]
MR. MOORMAN?

Well, I believe there are at least —

it depends, I guess, on what you think is long, but we have at

10
least 30 years of decisions now, and there are six or seven
Supreme Court opinions on the subjecto
QUESTION:

On the subject of water rights reserved

by implication?
MR, MOORMAN;

Yes, Your Honor,

I think the doctrine

was foreshadowed in the 1899 decision of United States v, Rio
Grande Dam s Irrigation Company, which discussed a number of
the authorities cited by New Mexico here.

In that case, the

Court stated with regard to the water rights of the United
States that in the absence of specific authority from Congress,
a state cannot by its legislation destroy the right of th®
United States as the owner of lands bordering on a stream to
the continued flow of its waters so far at least as may be
necessary for the beneficial uses of government property.

And

I am citing 174 U.S., at 703.
Most recently, in 1976, this Court enunciated the
doctrine in the case .of Cappaert v. United States as follows %
When the federal government withdraws its land from the public
domain and reserves it for a public purpose, the government by
implication reserves, the pertinent water then unappropriated
• •

to the extent needed to accomplish the purposes of the reser­
vation,
f'

QUESTION:

Well, you are not equating the pupfish in

Cappaert with the Gila trout here, are you?
MR. MOORMAN:

X°m sorry, Your Honor, I didn't

II
understand the question.
QUESTIONS

You are not equating the concern for the

pupfish in Cappaert with the Gila trout here, are you?
MR. MOORMAN:

Oh.

In that case, the United States

reserved water for the purpose of preserving the pupfish, a
somewhat limited purpose.

Here the question is what are the

purposes of the Gila National Forest and whether the water
rights which the United States claims falls within those pur­
poses.

It is the position of the United States that the re­

served water rights it seeks for wildlife, for stock grazing,
for recreation and for in-stream flows for those and other
purposes such as fire protection or to provide a continuous
flow of water, do indeed fall within the purposes for which
the Gila National Forest was reserved.
And since there have been some questions on it, I
would like to take up first, if I could, the -™
QUESTION:

Of course, failing that, you can always

resort to eminent domain, can81 you?
MR, MOORMAN %

Well, only if Congress authorises it

and» of course, we have no way of knowing what the ramifica­
tions of that would be, Your Honor.

It would ba hugely expen­

sive at this late date.
QUESTION:

And very controversial, wouldn’t it?

It

has always been controversial as to what would be done with
western land reservations, and the western state Senators and

12
Representatives have always kept the heat on the Department of
the Interior and other executive agencies to make sure that
there was proper consideration for the interests of private
proprietors on those western lands.
MR. M00RMM7:

I think, Mr. Justice, you understand

the politics very well.
QUESTION;

Well,, is that wholly divorced from the

law?
MR. MOORMAN;

Well, I think Congress has never taken

upon itself to give up the reserved water rights, so I think
we must take the law as it stands in that way.

They certainly

have been aware of them for many, many years and it —
QUESTION;

There was also considerable debate, it is

reflected in the briefs and opinions, as to what the purpose
of the national forests wore going to be and how restricted or
how wide open those purposes were going to be, wasn’t there
not?
MR. MOORMAN;

That’s correct, Your Honor.

The Mew Mexico courts held that the ..United S'fates
could not have an in-stream flow in the Rio Mimbres for any
purpose whatsoever.

We consider this both an absurd and a

harsh result because it means that junior appropriators could
take all of the water from the streams and da-water the national
forests so there would be no water available for any purpose.
legitimate or not.

13
Mow, as I read the brief of the State of New Mexico,
they have conceded that this holding goes too far and that the
United States can have an in-stream flow in the national
forest for the appropriate purposes of the national forest.
I further read their position to be that 'they simply differ
with us as to what are the appropriate purposes of the national
forest»

They take a much narrower view than the United States

does, and we believe that this concession of the State of New
Mexico alone requires reversal in this case, and 1 refer the
Court to Footnotes .11 and 15 of the state5 s brief.
The state's concession is well grounded, because it
is clear that the cases have not distinguished between flow
and diversion rights.

I have referred and quoted earlier the

first ease touching on the reserve rights doctrine, the 1899
decision in the Rio Grande Dam & Irrigation Company case,
where the water rights of the United States are referred to as
the continued flow of waters.
Special Master feifkin in his opinion in Arizona v.
California 'stated that one of the purposes of the national
forest was to maintain natural flows, and the Organic Act it­
self states as the second purpose

for which national forests

may bs established as for the purpose of securing favorable
conditions of wetter flows.
QUESTIONS

What did this Court do with Judge Rifkin's

finding or recommendation — I’ve forgotten how you described

it.

14
MR, MOORMANs

This Court issued a decree, Your Honor,

in which it stated, it decreed that the United States had the
right, to divert water from the Gila and San Francisco Rivers
in the Gila. National Forest —• and X am quoting now from the
decree -- "in quantities reasonably necessary to fulfill the
purposes of tha Gila National Forest, with priority dates of
the date of withdrawal for tha forest purposes of each area
of the forest within which the water is used.”
376 U.S. 350»

And that is

How, that tracks almost exactly the language of

the proposed decree of Special Master Rifkin which he attached
to his report.
In his report, Judge Rifkin stated more specifically
what the purposes of the forest were.
QUESTION s

And that was not adopted by this Court,

was it, in'its degree, it was not incorporated?
MR. MOORMAN?

It was not incorporated, but it is

our view that it had to be the predicate for the decree or the
decree did not decree any rights.

It only then stated a rule

of law, if that was not the predicate for the decree.
Wo have argued in our brief, of course, that that
collateral estops New Mexico, which was a party to that case
here.
With respect to all the water rights wo claim, Your
Honor, whether they are in-stream flow rights or consumptive
rights, we argue that the United States is entitled to such

IS
rights as they are all within the purposes of a national
forest under the Organic Act.

The Organic Act* Your Honor*

reads in relevant part as follows* if I mays

"No public

forest reservation shall be established except to improve and
protect the forest within the reservation or for the purpose
of securing favorable conditions of water flows and to furnish
a continuous supply of timber for the use and necessities of
the citizens of the United States.65
In the following paragraph of the Organic Act* in
relevant part* the Congress instructed the Secretary of the
Interior "shall make provisions for the protection against
destruction by fire: and depredations upon the public forest
rand forest reservations."

And a little bit further he was

instructed that to make such rules and regulations and estab­
lish such service as will insure the objects of such reserva­

tions* namely to regulate their occupancy and use and to pre­
serve the forests thereon from destruction.
QUESTION^

Mr. Moorman* where did we get all of these

fancy names of the acts like the Creative Act and the Organic
Act and Multiple-Use Sustained Yield Act?

Is somebody down

in the department charged with responsibility for figuring up

fancy names?
\

MR. MOORMAN ?

They are getting worse* as I read what

is coining out of Congress* Your Honor.
QUESTIONi

So you blame the law-makers» do you?

IS
MR. MOORMAN t

Wall, I wouldne t blame this Court for

that.
Our first argument under the Organic Act, Your Honor,
is that those provisions of the Organic Act which call for the
protection and preservation of the national forests must by
implication have reserved water for the national forests.
First, the Congress stated as its first reason for the estab­
lishment of national forests that they be improved and pro­
tected? and, secondly, Your Honors, the Congress twice gave
clear instructions to the Secretary that he should take actnons
to protect and preserve the forests* at one point referring to
preservation of the forests as one of the objects of the reser­
vation.

Thus wa argue, Your Honors, to the extent that the

Secretary needs water so as to protect -the forests, it must be
reserved or Congress' plan would be thwarted.
For example, the development and placement of stock
water holes is often the only way or the best way tc insure an
even distribution of the stock over the forests.

A failure to

achieve an even distribution of stock can quickly lead to overgrazing, ruined land and erosion.

Thus when the forest ranger

locates a water source for stock, he is not thinking simply of
providing water for a use but he is alas thinking of protecting
the very soil of the forests from erosion.
QUESTION;

Was any of the land reserved in the Gila

National For-sat reserved before the passage of the Organic Act?

17
MR. MOORMANi

No, the first proclamation was on

March 2, 1899, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

And the Organic Act was what, 1897?

MR. MOORMAN:

1897, June 6, 1897.

Now, this principle

of preservation applies equally to something such as a camp
ground, although you might not think so at first.

When a

ranger locates his camp ground with a water diversion, he
thinks not only of servicing campers but he also thinks of
miniraizing the risk of fir© from the careless camper.

By 1©~

eating his diversion at & specific place, he not only attracts
the cancer to a safe location, ha provides a source of water
to put out the fire.

And clearly if protection of the forest

and its resources requires an in-stream flow as opposed to a
diversion, there is nothing special about that.
QUESTION%

Are you justifying the water for campers

under the terms of the Organic Act?
MR. fiOOEMAN:

Yes, indeed.

We believe that the

forests are open for campers, that the use of water is on® of
the tools which the forest ranger must use to protect the
forest from campers, among other things.

He uses it as an in­

centive to guide their camping in certain spots where it is
safe from fire and as a resource to help put out camp fires.
I should point out that the use of the forests by
C€j.jpers and other recreationists is quite large.

In 1976

■-r.Ione, there were 122 million recreation days of use on the

18
national forests,
QUESTION:

What was it in 189?, the year the Organic

Act was -passed?
MR.. MOORMAN %

In 1907, I think we — 1 don' t know

what the figure was in 1897, bat we do know that the area of
the Gila National Forest —» I can speak for the Mimhres — was
visited.

Thera were the Gila Hot Springs, which wero later

taken out of the forest and made into —
QUESTIONs

Well, do you think Congress really re­

served the Gila National Forest as opposed to the various
national parks for the purpose of use by campers?
MR. MOORMAN 3

No doubt about it.

3ut I would like

to draw the distinction between the two.
QUESTIONS

No doubt about what?

MR. MOORMAN:

The fact that I think that Congress

reserved the national forests for campers, Your Honor.
QUESTIONS

You are speaking now as of 1897?

MR. MOORMAN:

Yes, I am.

Congress clearly did not

wish the national forests to fo© treated the way national parks
were, which is to say areas which would not be — where the
resources would not be used in an economic way, such as cutting
timber, range or hunting of deer,

However, it is very clear,

it seems to us, that Congress did intend for the forests to be
used, it made a big thing — there were a lot of references in
the legislative history to the effect that the forests were to

19
be places of use, not places of non-use, and camping by all
sorts of people was something that was don® quite regularly in
those days, not only for the kind of camper we think of today
but campers in connection with grazing and other uses.
Recreational use of the forest was known at that
time.

And/furthermore, I should say that the Forest Service

assumed from the very beginning that this was one of the pur­
poses of the national forests and Congress in fact in 1899,
two days before the first proclamation was issued for this
for .jt, passed a law authorising the Chief of the Forest
Service to lease land in the national forests adjacent to Hot
Springs for the purposes of recreation.
I wish to make on® other argument under the Organic
Act, and that concerns the provision of the Act which refers
tc occupancy and us®.

The statute directs the Secretary to

issue rules and regulations to regulate the occupancy and us®
of the forests.

And we would argue that to the extent that he

rev ids water for that purpose, water is also reserved and it
would work this way, for example, a ranger would oftentimes
go :>nt and examine the range and determine that it is under­
utilized.

slow, hs may prevent over-use by fencing, but often-

tines the only way ho can prevent under-utilisation of the
■/

range is by providing a water source*

in our /View, the extent

of which the 'Forest Service needs water for use and occupancy
to preserve and protect and to promote all of the-uses which

20
Congress contemplated, water is reserved under the reserved
rights doctrine.
Thank you. Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Mr. Simms.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD K, SIMMS, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SIMMS2

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court?
There are two fundamental mistakes in the United
States approach to the reservation of waters in national
forests.

The United States views its powers over western

waters as the rule instead of the exception and the U.S. either
ignoras or hides from the fact that Congress explicitly relin­
quished control of the flow and the use of the waters in our
national forests to the respective states.
Compounding that fundamental legal and historical
misapprehension of the matter, the United States also ignores
the fact that unlike any other federal enclave, unlike any
other federal reservation of lands from the public domain, the
national forests war© designed with respect to water to maxi­
mise water yield to appropriates under stats law;
I would like to make reference to four question, Mr.
•Justice White, about• whether or not there were any private
users upstream,

in the forest there are — in the Rio Mimbres

drainage of the forest, there are 17,000 acres of patented fee

21
land.

There are e number of diversions on some of these lands.

Some of the diversions are being made by other parties to this
adjudication against whom at this point in the litigation 'the
rights of the United States have not vested.
QUESTION z

So the in-stream, flow is; really a live

issue?
MR. SIMMSs
QUESTIONs
MR. SIMMS s

It is a live issue,
In this casa, as a practical matter?
I believe it isand it is also live in

the sense that if the Court were to recognise the minimum instream flow, we would effectively prevent the transfer of any
water rights under state law.

That is just as much & part of

the property right under stats law as is the right to divert.
If w© jump over to the Gila side in the same forest,
you can see its effect on Phelps Dodge Corporation.

Phelps

Dodge spent $125 million buying up water rights, transferring
them to a point above certain forest lands? in total spent
about $425 million creating a smelting plant.

Subsequent to

all of that, the United States, by filing a paper in the
Office of the State Engineer in Mew Mexico, informs Phelps
Dodge that they would now like to claim a minimum in-stream
flow below that point of diversion.
QUESTIONS

I had the feeling

from your brief and

from some of the things you have already said that in a way
you challenge the whole theory of reserved rights.

22
MR. SIMMS:

Ko, we do not challenge the whole theory

of reserved rights.
QUESTION §

You are saying that is just the extent of

it. you are arguing about here?
MR. SIMMS:

That's true.

And unlike the assertion of

the United States that there is no difference between us* there
is a difference.

There is a difference as to the way in which

we apply the doctrine.
QUESTION:

You take the position 1 think in your

brief, don't you, that since the doctrine of reserved rights
is an exception and is contrary to the general law, that
appropriation of water in tha western states is governed by
state law since it is an exception, the implied reservation
should be minimally and narrowly understood?
MR. SIMMS *

Fox* that reason and other reasons, Your

Honor, that we discuss in the brief*
QUESTION:
MR* SIMMS:
QUESTION:

Yon do take that basic position?
Right.
Do you fit in the reserved rights doctrine

in the sense that when the United States has reserved or has
created a national forest, that this is sort of an appropria­
tion of water for beneficial use?

Is that the way it fits in

or not?
MR. SIMMS:

I don't know if I understand your ques­

tion- Mr. Justice White.

23
QUESTION?

Welly I just want to know,, is the r@se.rve

rights doctrine — does it fit in with what you feel is the
way the United States wanted to handle its water or to dispose
■ 1 tie vuter

or is it an exception to the general rule?

ME, SIMMS *

No, nof we think it does fit in.

We

aren’t denying the existence of the reservation doctrine.
What we are asking the Court to do is precisely what it did
in Capp&ert, to look at the authorizing legislation under
which lands night he'withdrawn from the public domain and then
apply the principle of the reservation doctrine.
In1 this situation, forests ware created in large part
to protect the watersheds in order to maximize water yield to
appropriators under state law.

The national legislature, the

Secretary of the Interior repeatedly in his rules and regula»
lions — his rules and regulations right out the door 26 days
after the act was passednoted that control of the flow and
uso of water was left to the individual states.

By its asser­

tion of claims to minimum in-stream flows, it seems that the
Fnit^d States is going quit© beyond what was intended before.
At the same time, the decision of the New Mexico
Suprema Court does- not preclude the assertion of a claim to
minimum in-stream flows provided that claim comes within the
ambit of the purposes of the Organic Administration Act.
such evidence was put on in this cas®.

No

The only evidence that

was put on in this case related to the protection of fish, and

24
we submit that it is patently clear that the legislation and
its history do not permit a reading that would say that fish
purposes were among the purposes for which the lands of the
forests could have been withdrawn.
Your Honors, the United States reply brief, while in
my view says virtually nothing, I think is probably the most
telling brief in this case.

In response to the legislative

history of the Creative Act of 1891, that piece ©f legislation
that authorises the President to withdraw the lands for
national forests, in response to some forty pages of history
relating to the Organic Administration Act of 1897, the Act
which limits the purposes for which lands could be withdrawn
under the 1891 Act, in response to the legislative history of
all of the applicable rights-of-way statutes on into this
century, in response to the history relating to the decisions
of the Secretary of the interior, in response to the decisions
and opinion's of the General Land Office, indeed the United
States Attorney General, in its reply brief the United States
offers no rebuttal, it offers no legal history, it offers no
law.
Instead, what the United Statas trias to do in our
view is to muddy the waters, is to make it a little bit more
difficult to see this case clearly.

The United States explains

that we have somehow ameliorated the effect of the New Mexico
Supreme Court’s decision in our brief, that we have made a

25
concession.

That is not true.

Indeed, subsequent to the decision in the case, the
United States went before one of our state district courts
and put on evidence in support of what it says we just now say
they can do in our brief.

I don't think their understanding

of the decision was any different than ours.

The decision was

rendered the way it was because there was no evidence in the
record for any of thes© other matters.
In the United States brief, it also refers to a
number of appropriations statutes.

This Court has never before

held that reserved water rights; arise out of appropriations of
money.

Reserved water rights arise out of withdrawals of land

from the; public domain.
The United Statas most importantly also argues that
the U.S. never relinquished its rights, that somehow there is
a broad power in the United States that makes these claims
acceptable now, and because of that broad power this Court
should not strictly construe the statutes authorising the
withdrawal of land from the public domain.

I think their in­

terpretation of the law is most definitely wrong.
They make reference to the Rio Grand© case.

In dicta

in the Rio Grande case and subsequently in another case called
Outerias v. Albuquerque Land & Irrigation Company, this Court
oe.M thiss

"Of course, as held in the Rio Grande case, even

a state as respects streams within its borders in the absence

26
of specific authority from Congress cannot by its legislation
destroy the right of the United States as the owner of lands
bordering on a stream to the continued flow of its waters so
far at least as may be necessary for the beneficial uses of
the government property*”
They seem to say that we really don't need the
reservation doctrine,
that just by virtue of that dicta the
r
United States could by fiat say that we now want water in the
west, we arc going to use water for this purpose, therefore
it is ours.

That is not true.

The waters in the west war© severed.

plete.

Plenary contori

It means com­

When the waters ware severed, they wore severed,

In

the. United States view, there is some illogical incomplete
severance.

There is .ho such thing in logic.

It is also clear from a reading of Rid Grande that
that case i'o a case that says the United States may protect
it: rig! .t. to navigability.

That case got back- to the Supreme

Court three years later,.- in 1903.

If the Court •takes a look at

that opinion, it is clear also that that case related only to
navigability and not to non-navi gable waters*
•The important language with respect to non-navigable
waters is .in Justice Sutherland's opinion in 1935, in
Cali£ornia-Oragon Power Company v, Beaver Portland Cement.

He

27
said, "In the absence of federal legislation, the states would
be powerless to affect the riparian rights of the United.
States, but the authority of Congress to vest such power in
the states and that it has done so by the legislation to which
we have referred cannot be doubted."

There is no question

that the severance of water affects the rithts of the United
States, no question whatsoever.

You can't use Rio Grande as

a broad brush to somehow broaden the reservation doctrine.

It

j usfc doesn11 work.
1'our Honors, X think what this case boils down to is
an attempt by the United States to protect commendable environ»
mental values through a scheme of legislation that was designed
to do something else.’-"
Wfe have laid out the history of the applicable legis­
lation. ' If that history is understood, there is no 'way in my
opinion that Your Honors could believe and reverse ths decision
of the flaw Mexico Supreme Court.

It is simply impossible.

X/f this case is decided on the basis of historical
reality, instead of on the basis of the regrets of certain
Justice Department lawyers now, we are confident that the de­
cision of the R m Mexico Supreme Court will he upheld.
Thank you.
