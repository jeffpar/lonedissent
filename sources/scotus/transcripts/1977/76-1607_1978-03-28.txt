MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will continue the

arguments in the Securities and Exchange Commission against
Sloan.
Mr. Sloan, you may continue whenever- you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL H. SLOAN ON
BEHALF OF RESPONDENT (RESUMED)
MR. SLOAN:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I wish to bring the attention of the Court to a

small factual matter which came to my attention yesterday.
You mentioned 36 trading suspension orders, and the source
of this is because on page 122 ©f the Appendix there is a
list of orders and there is a typographical error in that the
SEC when

uw%

copied lujf original petition left out the

December 25, 1975,order.
QUESTIONs

The question I put. Mr. Sloan, was a

purely hypothetical asking whether if 36 consecutive 10-day
orders were entered.
MR. SLOAN:

Yas.

But 1 did discover that there are

36 listed here, and in fact there were 37, because there is
a typographical error in their appendix.
QUESTION?

My hypothetical was deliberately one

less in order to make it a hypothetical.
I®. SLOAN:
that.

OK.

For whatever reason, I did notice

And in the original record I do have the December 25

30

date in my patition which I filed

in

th© Court of Appeals

which has bean transmitted to this Court.
However, on the subject of the record, I also
wish to bring to the attention of this Court the fact that the
SEC has refused to permit the record as it was in the state
it was, in the state it was before the Court of Appeals,to be
transmitted to this Court.

1 mention this in my brief, and

it's now a matter which is pending before the Court of
Appeals because I filed a motion in the Court of Appeals to
require the SEC to certify th© full record to the Court of
♦

•

Appeals and that matter is now pending.
X have also explained what happened in some detail
in a letter which I wrote to the Clerk of this Court, but he
•

'V .

•I . :

has advised rae that he will not distribute it at thi3 late
date.
What essentially happened was that after the Court
of Appeals made its decision,, the Court of Appeals sent the
record back to the SEC, which is its normal practice.

When

this Court granted certiorari, the SEC was directed or requested
to sand the record back to the Court of Appeals so it could
be transmitted to this Court,»

But what it did was it switched

the records so that the record that was sent back to the Court
of Appeals was not the record which th© Court of Appeals had
returned to 'the SEC, and th© Court of Appeals was not apprised
of this fact.

So that the record which this Court has

31
consists of memorandums dealing with trading suspension orders.
I have no objection to this Court reading

these memorandums,

but the fact remains that they were not filed in the Court of
Appeals.

All that was filed in the Court of Appeals was the

certified list.

The record which has not boon transmitted to

this Court concerns fell© record of the administrative proceed­
ings against me which was a part of 'the record in the
consolidated case when these two eases were before the
Court of Appeals.

The SEC says that that record is not

pertinent to the issues involved in this appeal and therefor©
they will not transmit that record to the Court of Appeals for
certification to this Court even though they have been requested
by the clerk of the Court of Appeals to do so.
So right now we have a situation because I happen
to feel that that record is pertinent to the question of
mootness which the sEC has rafted particularly ::ith rcyaxd to
certain points which were discussed yesterday.
QUESTION:

I thought the Court raised tha question

of mootness, Mr. Sloan.
MR. SLOAN:

The SSC has always said that this case

was moot right from the beginning.
QUESTION:

But didn't -the Court ask the partias

to brief the question of mootness?
MR, SLOAN:

Oh, yes, they did.

briefing the question of mootness already.

But tha SEC was

32
Now, this goes to the case of Weinstein v.
\

Bradford, for example, which was discussed yesterday.

It is

true that the trading suspension orders hav® expired.

However,

at the present time there is an order currently outstanding
which is a lifetime bar against me from being associated with
a securities dealer.

I believe that I can show through the

record which the SEC has refused to transmit that this lifetime
bar was based in part on successive trading suspension orders
which the Court of Appeals declared illegal.
QUESTIONs

Was that order before the Court of

Appeals?
MR. SLOANi

Yes, it was, because there war© two

casas before the Court of Appeals.
consolidated both cases.
QUESTION:

Th© Court of Appeals

Th© record is combined.

Why is it th® Court of Appeals didn't

mention it?
Mil. SLOAN:
QUESTION:
MIL SLOAN:

Didn't mention what?
The order you are talking about.
Oh, it's part of th® same decision.

Th© same decision in the Court of Appeals discussed 'two
different cases, but they were consolidated.

This Court when

It granted certiorari only agreed to review the issues
pertaining to ora of the cases, but nevertheless I claim that
fcho record of tooth cases, since it was a consolidated case,
should be hers, and I should be allowed to cite documents in

33
the record of the other case which I think demonstrate that
this cas© is not moot,»
QUESTION?

Is it your contention, then* Mr, Sloan,

that th© SEC rsiiad on u number of factors in issuing its
lifetime bar order against you and one of them was this
10-day order and therefor® it is at least conceivable that,
if this 10-day order were found to be invalid# they might rot
have entered the same lifetime bar order against you?
MR. SLOAN:

Yes.

Sihat my contention is precisely

is that the SEC when they issued successive 10-day suspension
orders deducted from my net capital certain securities which
were in "failed to deliver,,"
in violation of

Then they found me retroactively

t capital rule and on the basis of

findings that I was in violation of the net capital rule, they
then barred me from the securities business.
If those 10-day suspension orders were illegal in
th© first place# I would say they cannot rely on them to make
net capital cl@dust.ions and therefor© the order which barrel
me for life in the sc.cuihtidtoosc.’ rs re.vs.*.re.
QUESTION:

That’s ‘th© tie-in between the 10-day

suspension arid the net capital deduction?
MR. SLOAN:

Because the Securities and Exchange

has a release 10209# which states that if a broker is short a
security which is suspended from trading by the SEC# he is
required to deduct from his net capital the"fails to deliver"

M
in suspended securities, and I in fact was short at the time
that they entered successive suspension orders on a number
of occasions, and they deducted the "’fails to deliver" in
suspended securities.

Therefor©, it seems to me reasonable

'that if those orders were illegal, they cannot rely on then
to bar iee from the securities business.
X haven8t reached that point in this case.
know if this Court affirms the decision.

X don’t

It may be that

there will bo further proceedings and I will lose on that
particular paint.

But it seams to mo that X have the right

to make this showing that they did in fact rely on successive
trading suspension orders to bar m from the securities
business.

QUESTION:
MR. SLOAN:

Can you raopan it?
1 think 1 can go back to the Securities

and Exchange Commission in the first instance and reopen it.
That would be the placo T would go to with that particular ©lain.

36
And that is why 1 feel it is; critical to have the record here
so that the Justices of this Court can look at the record and
s©@ that in fact they did deduct frcra my net capital certain
sums of money based on successive trading suspension orders.
Nowf 1 will point out that because of the continu­
ing policy of the SEC* this case has been going on for a long
time.

The specific orders which the Court of Appeals vacated

were not themselves used by the SEC as a basis* because by the
time this case got in tha court — this is the third suit I
have brought — by the time this case got before the Court; of
Appeals,, it was too late to challenge those suspension orders
because there ir a 60-dny iiritaticn in csetter. 25 fa) of In­

that if you will affirm that decision, it will be clear that
all these orders were illegal

'them to reopen the proceeding.

You do have the east; before you.

Even

though my petition was denied and their petition in the same
case was granted# I don't think the Court's jurisdiction is
limited -- I don't expect the Court to decide anything about
that case# but I don't think the Court’s jurisdiction is
limited to these two specific points the SEC has raised.
QUESTION:

Well, you will assume that I might bs

38

right?
MR. SLOAN:

I will assume you raight ba right.

I

eaid i don't ©xpact this Court to do anything with regard
to that matter.

2 just say that on the issue of mootnass, which

I am briefing and arguing, that I can demonstrat© -that the case
is not moot through the record.

2 don't know what is going to

happen if the Court of Appeals grants my motion,the SEC
transmits the records to the Court of Appeals and it arrives
'here a month from now or so.

It seems to me this is & vary

undesirable situation to b© in.
QUESTION3

May I suggest your time is running.

You

might get on to the merits.
MR. SLOANs

Right.

Now, yesterday the SEC gave three reasons for th«
trading suspension, and they said that this suspension was
this length because there were three diffarant things going on,
and this is the reason why they had to let it go for so long.
On© was market manipulation, two was & change in management,
three was a late 10-K

filing.

I want to address the facts which are in the record
with regard to these three matters.
The change, in management took place at a meeting of
the board of directors of Canadian Javelin Ltd, on March 6,
1976,

At that time a group headed by William Wismer threw

out the Doylo group, threw out tha management of Canadian

Javelin Ltd., fixed Mr» Doyle personally.

This is reflected

in til® March 26 memo which is on page 104-«105 of the Appendix.
■ Th@ 10-K delinquency/ which is another reason
cited by the SEC* occurred on March 31/ 1976, and tills can b©
ss@n from page 110 of the Appendix.
So prior to March 6 there were 32: suspension orders.
Prior to March 31 there were 34 suspension orders.

This means

that the SEC suspended trading for 31 times because of the
market manipulation* for 2 more times because of the change in
management» and for another 3 times because of lateness in a
•fff-K filing.

Ths SEC also referred to a fugitive from justices
yesterday in the argument that they presented.

However* on

March 6* 1976, Mr. Doyle, who was the notorious fugitive from
justice who they are referring to, was thrown out of the
company.

H© was fired personally.

And the SEC claims a basis

'.for suspending trading for that reason.
• •'
s>

On July 30, 1376, after the suspension was lifted,
there was a caurt-ordered special meeting of the stockholders
which I attended in Montreal, which is also discussed in the
f"record, there is a copy of the judge's orders here, holding
a special ©lection, and at that point Doyle got back into
management and threw the Wismer group out.

So now we have a

situation where an individual, a Toronto attorney, became
president of Javelin Ltd.

At that point the SEC 8usp©n^e trading.

■10
•r;H? fef-

„

Three month? later when the fugitive from justice gets back
in control of the company, they do not suspend trading»

I

point this out because I think this illustrates that really
their reason is a fiction»
In addition to that, Mr. Justice Powell yesterday
raised the question of whether a corporation has the right
‘t.

<y;

to come in and ask for a hearing to protest a trading suspension.
Ironically it’s reported in the Wall Street Journal that at the
time of the May 2, 1976, lifting cf the trading suspension,,
management of Canadian Javelin Ltd. petitioned the SEC to
i'viSt r.:-y

. l\:

continue the trading suspension.
„5 •■'••'•' :- 'V

And, incidentally, also the

•

earlier trading suspension which was terminated in January
1975, the management of Canadian Javelin again requested —»
a differunt management -» that the SEC continue the trading
suspension and filed a motion and obtained a stay in the
district court.
This illustrates a point that very often the
corporation itself

wants

the trading suspension even

though it's to the detriment of its own stockholders because
of corporate management, for thair own personal reasons, may
.

....

iy

desire that trading not take place.
Now, in fcha matter of the 1Q-K, this 10-K report
became delinquent on March 31, 1976, as the record state©»
have not known of any case *=— she SEC often suspends trading
bacause of a 10-K delinquency, but they don’t suspend-on the

x

41
day that the 10-H became delinquent, and they don’t, susppend
even two month© later because the trading suspension here was
lifted on May 2.
QUESTION:

challenge the right of the SEC to issue mores than one suspension.

MR. SLOAN:

Yes, that’s correct.

discussion of this.

MR. SLOAN:

No# I do not make that concession,

I realise the amicus does make that concession.

I do not.

Because 1 do not believe that the SEC aan ba allowed#
particularly when they clo not issue reasons for the trading
suspensions.

Therefore# when they say that

— and they haven't said that in this case# but if they said
that# that something completely new and different has arisen#
what would happen is —
*

QUESTION:
MR. SLOAN:

What if it was the same old tiling?
I think if it was the s&mm old thing#

it clearly would ba prohibited by the statute.

And I am saying

even if it was for a different reason# it would also b„
prohibited. When Congress originally passed the provision in
1934# section 19(a) had four provisions# 1# 2# 3» and 4.
Section 19(a)(1)#

(2)# and (3)# all required the SEC to give

notice and the opportunity for a hearing.

Only section 19(a)(4)

allowed the SEC to act. summarily without notice and the
opportunity for hearing.

And both the House and Sanate reports

instated in 1934 that they did not require the SEC to give
•

notice and opportunity for hearing because tills was a summary
power to be exercised in emergency situations.
QUESTION:

That's right.

There have been soma

instances this year in which th© SEC on three separata occasions

QUESTION;

Mr. Sloan, do you concede that th® SEC

would have power under 12 (k) to issue a 10-day suspension of
trading in, let's say, January and then again to issue & 10-day

f;

MR. SLOAN:
QUESTION:

No.

That would be ~

Why not?

What is the difference between

-January and March and January 12 and January 13?
MR. SLOAN;

I think this goes really to a matter of

44

the intent of Congress. Congress did not intend that the S"3C —
particularly since it never issues reasons for restraints,
we don't know if it has a new reason or a different reason,
QUESTION:

Your point is, though, good reasons or

bad, with or without reasons, no matter how great the reason
or how great the public interest, that 12 (k) as a matter of
th© power of the Commission simply does not empower the
Commission cc issue a suspension of trading for longer than
a 10“day period.
i®. SLOAN:

it.

QUESTIONj

That's correct.
That's your basic position as I understand

Am I right?
MR. SLOAN:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
Mr. Sloan, what about the 1975 amendment,

one-year amendment?
MB.. SLOAN:

See, section 12(j) which you are referring

to is actually a renumbering, because it was formerly called
section 19{a)(2).

They moved it over to section 12 Cj}.

The

Commission has had th© power since 1934 to suspend the registra­
tion of a security.

Now when they enacted 12(j) they included

a sentence which in addition to renumbering they include! a
sentence which said it would be illegal for a broker-dealer
to buy or sail or us© iaeans or instrumentalities of interstate
commerce to affect a transaction in a security whose registra­
tion has bean suspended or revoked.

45
So that this maJf.es it clear, although it was clear
already, that the SEC could after notice and a hearing
suspend the registration, which would also suspend the trading
in the security under section 12 (j).

But they have always

had this power since 1934 —
QUESTION;

For on© year.

MB'.o SLOANs

For one year.

Incidentally, 2 would like to mention that in this
case —
QUESTION:

That’s not involved in it.

MR. SLOAN:

They haven5t exercised that power in

section X2 < j > .
QUESTION:

Thatfs what I mean.

MR. SLOAN:

Tney haven’t provided us with a hearing.
;«

I would like to point out that in this particular
case, tiie SEC suspended trading fer 370 days, which, is raorc
than one year.

Therefore, thay actually suspended trading

for more time under section 12(k) without notice and the
•'

A.

opportunity for c, hearing than they war© permitted to 'suspend
with notice and the opportunity for a hearing under section
12 (j).

So what they are saying.is that they can suspend

trading for a longer period of time without notice than they
can with notice, and I am sura that this could-not possibly be
what Congress intended.
Now, also yesterday Mr. Justice Powell asked whether

46
the rollover proceedings are ex parte.

And, of course, the

Commission says that this is not a rubber stamp proceeding,,
the Commission very seriously considers the needs of investors
and this ki id of thing.

But again, although I don't want to

ran into th® same trap that I may have fallen into just a
second ago, I think ‘that the record demonstrates that the
Commission, not only ia it a rubber stamp proceeding, but the
Commission itself plays no part in the decision to suspend.
In the record of this case, the first trading suspen­
sion is dated April 29, 1975.

The memorandum which they have

submitted as the record of this trading suspension is a
memorandum by the staff dated May 2, 1975, three days later.
So that it is clear — this is not a memorandum from the
Commission; this is a memorandum from the staff, and It explains
the reasons for the trading suspension.

Prom this it is

:clear that fcha Commissioners themselves could not have received
■ '-this' memorandum at the time trading was suspended.

But this is really about

It is quite clear that the Secretary of the
Commission is performing an administerial task apparently at
the direction of members of the staff,and the Commissioners
themselves are not involved,
QUESTION:

Mr, Sloan let me ask you what is you::

view of what the Commission's duty was 10 days after the first
order was entered if they were persuaded there was market
manipulation going on* but they didn8t have real solid proof
of it?

What do you say they should have done?
MR, SLOAN:

The market manipulation in this instance

ended on February 12, 1975,

1 had the indictment.

This is

the information that was filed in Canada by the Canadian
authorities.

And the last washed trade that took place, which

is alleged here, the 416 council boys
took place on February 12, IS 75.

trading, the Ia»t owe

And all the trades alleged

here occurred on the Montreal or Vancouver Stock Exchanges.
Now, in a hypothetical situation, if there is a
market manipulation, I would say that a trading suspension
order which halts trading for 10 days is sufficient to bring
to an end any market manipulation, because usually market
manipulators rely on certain things to keep the price up.

They

have the park securities, j' was a broker-dealer for five years
and I somehow have some idea ■•/hat they do when they manipulate
a stock.

And when a trading suspension comes along, they

They have

1£ there is some remedy, m addition to

that the appropriate relief is for them to apply to Congress
for this remedy.

Congress has given them section 12{j), and

it is stated in the Senate Report 94-75 that this was intended
to be exercised when they wanted to suspend trading for a
period of extended duration.
Now they say this is insufficient because many
companies are not registered because they don’t have; as much
as a million dollars in assets and 500 stockholders which Is

49
required by section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act.
So they say many securities are not registered and therefor®
what's going to happen in the case of a security which is not
.registered o

How are we going to stop trading in that?
I think the answer is Congress simply didn't intend

they should be allowed to do this because you must remember*

Your answer to Mr. Justice Stevens is

that under the statute there just isn't any remedy provided
to suspend trading in a security for more than 10 days* even
with a hearing.
MR. SLOAN:

No.

We are talking about securities

How about answering my Brother Stevens'

question, then, what should the SEC have dona here with
respect to a registered security?
MR. SLOAN:

Start a now proceeding?

With respect to a registered proceeding,

they could start with another 12(j) .

With respect to a

■QUESTION:

After notice and hearing.

MR.SLOAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

After notice and hearing.

So at the end of 10 days they should

have gone under 12.
MR. SLOAN:

Right.

That's what they should have

cion© in this case.
By th© way, in this case there was no issue of
Bdsconduct, at least according to the indictment and
according to the SEC5 £ complaint against Canadian — because
the SEC filed a complaint in the Southern District of New York
but the defendants war3 Doyle and his cohorts.
Javelin Ltd. was not named as a detendant.

Canadian

Solely in the

information filed in Canada, Canadian Javelin was not a
defendant.

So there was no issue of misconduct, therefore

section 12(j) could not have been invoked.

They make a big

point of this, but I think the remedy is to go to Congress and
ask for extended powers if that's rhr.t they need.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Your time has expired,

Mr. Sloan.
Mr. Pitt, you have three minutes left.
RriBc T'TAL ARGUMENT OF HARVEY L. PITT ON
)

BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR.. PITT:

Tha only brief points I wish to make

are that, as Mr. Sloan concedas at the end of his submission,
12(j) was inapplicable in the circumstance because the market

51
manipulation which went on was not engaged in by the company
and therefore issue of misconduct was not involved and 12(j)
was inapplicable.

That would have meant there was no remedy

whatsoever.
In addition, the manipulation that we charged was
charged to have begun in the beginning of 1975 and continued
right up to the date of the complaint.

It did not stop in

February 1975 according to the charges in our allegation.
The last point ~
QUESTION:

Mr. Pitt, is Mr. Sloan correct in telling

us that the change in management and the late 10-K filings
occurred in March of 1976 so they really couldn't have
justified the first 25 or 30 suspension orders?
MR. PITT:

We learned about it about that time.

QUESTION:

So you?: principal period o* suspension —

MR. PITT:

MR. PITT:

QUESTION:

Where is that?

MR. PITT:

There is an official Commission minute

record book that is kept in the agency.
QUESTION:

Would that have been for December 25, tco?

MR. PITT:

I don't know if that was — I must

confess I do not know if that was the precise date that that

What would have

happened is that, the order might have been entered on the
25th formally, but the decision to enter that order would have
bisen taken three or four days prior to that.
QUESTION:

I just want to be sure of this.

You

are telling us that the full Commission, every member, acts
on a suspension order and personally signs something.
ME. PITT:

A quorum of the Commission, a minimum of

three of the five members.

If son© members are sick or out

of town they might not participate, but a minimum of three
Commissioners must participate, and their votes are recorded
in an official minute.

QUESTION:

But you said you did see the minute that

said on Christmas Day the Commission —
MR. PITT:

No, your Honor.

The Commission did not

meet on Christmas Day, but the period of -the trading suspension
commenced on Chris femes Day.

The staff recommendation would

have come up three or four days earlier, at which point the
Commission would have met.

The Commission probably took that

action on December 12st or 22nd, to commence on December 25th.
The Commission itself would not meet on Christmas Day.
QUESTION:

Do the minutes record any findings?

MR. PITTs

The minutes indicate that the staff has

Commission has taken action because of public interest and

QUESTION:

Are those minutes available to Mr.

Sloan when he complains about what the SEC has dona?
MR. PITT*

I am simply unaware whether he requested

them in this case of whether they were made available.
QUESTION: What is the policy of the Commission?
MR. PITT:

The policy of the Commission is often

to make its minutes available in court litigation where they

are requested and under the Freedom of Information Act —
QUESTION:

Quit® apart from court litigation,

normally yon can sea a court order without having a litigation.
Is that the policy of the Commission?
MR. PITT:

The Commission's minutes are made

available under the Freedom of Information Act unless they
contain certain matters that might b® exempt, and they are. —
QUESTION:

That implies that they are not mads

available to Mr. Sloan, unless he proceeds under the Freedom of
Information Act.
MR. PITT:

If Mr. Sic an makes a request to tlio

Commission to see Commission minutes and there is no exempt
material in there, he would see the Commission's minutes.

MR. PITT;

.

'

;

*.

In that case we had specific requests from court-appointed
officers to suspend the trading, and the Commission obliged
the trustee in bankruptcy while the reorganisation proceeding
was effected.

Our present policy would not be to repeat that

■kind of activity.
QUESTION:

Mr. Pitt, am I correct that the suspension

order suspends trading in the stock by anyone whether involved

59

in manipulation or not.

If you had to go into court to

proceed against manipulators, you might get an injunction
against manipulation, but could you in court get an injunction
in trading by everyone?
MR. PITT;

No, we could not.

QUESTION;

So really this is a broader remedy in

its coverage than the one you can get in court with notice and
hearing and all the rest, isn't it?
MR. PITT;

This is a broader remedy, and it is

solely a stop gap remedy until we can stop the market forces
that are disrupting art orderly market place.
QUESTION;

Stop gap.

MR. PITT;

Stop gap.

QUESTION;

May I ask one other question.

That is correct.

Sloan correct in saying —* the first:

Is Mr.

suspension, I believe,

was on April 29, and the first memorandum the Commission filed
explaining the reason for the suspension or recommending it is
May 2.

Is that correct?
MR. PITT;

That, is the first memorandum that's in

the record.

I cannot be sure whether there was an earlier

memorandum.

But what often happens in response to that question

is that the staff will come up on an emergency basis orally
and advise the Commission that it has learned of certain facts
and tell the Commission, as in this case, it talked to Royal
Canadian Mounted Police authorities that they suspected a

manipulation and that there was a possible criminal indictment
in Canada, and the Commission would on the basis of that oral
presentation enter a suspension order.

Under the Sunshine

Act as it is now in effect, those discussions would be recorded
and there would be a tape recording to verify it.

Tha,t Act.
