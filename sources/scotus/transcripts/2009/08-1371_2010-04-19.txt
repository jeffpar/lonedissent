ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. McCONNELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

12

If Hastings is correct, a student who does

13

not even believe in the Bible is entitled to demand to

14

lead a Christian Bible study, and if CLS does not

15

promise to allow this, the college will bar them from its

16

forum for speech.

The First Amendment -- under the First

18

Amendment, rights run the opposite way.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But doesn't -- doesn't the

nondiscrimination policy, so that if you comply with

that you automatically comply with everything in the

7

nondiscrimination clause?

8

10

MR. McCONNELL:

It is broader.

It's our

position that either of these justifications for
excluding CLS is unconstitutional.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

Yes, but -- but the latter,

12

the nondiscrimination policy, you assert is -- is not

13

viewpoint neutral, that it has a particular impact upon

14

a religious organization; whereas, the other policy, the

15

all-comers policy, applies to everybody, and that

16

argument is not available to you.

17

MR. McCONNELL:

Justice Scalia, our

18

argument -- there are two policies.

They have invoked

19

both.

MR. McCONNELL:

11

Well, both policies we contend

Let's begin with the all-comers

unconstitutional, we will also need to deal with the

Let's begin with the all-comers policy.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Mr. McConnell, when I

3

read -- when I read the papers that Hastings submitted

4

to the district court at the same time that the joint

5

stipulation was submitted, I saw one reference after

6

another to an allegation that Hastings was applying its

7

policy in a discriminatory manner, that it was not in

8

fact insisting that all registered student organizations

9

admit all applicants.

And when I read their brief in

10

the Ninth Circuit, I saw that point reiterated again and

11

again.
So that led me to believe that what was

12
13

stipulated was not that in fact they had a policy which

14

they enforced under which anybody who applied to any

15

group would be admitted, but that this was what Dean

16

Kane had announced.

17

necessarily the actual policy that was employed.

18

that was the argument it seemed to me that CLS was

19

making; isn't that correct?
MR. McCONNELL:

20
21

That was the stated policy, but not

That's entirely correct,

Justice -- Justice Alito.

That’s --

14

District Judge, here are the facts that we stipulate.

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the latter is the policy.

2

MR. McCONNELL:

Yes, because the policy is I

14

wanted to exclude all black people, all women, all

15

handicapped persons, whatever other form of

16

discrimination a group wants to practice, that a school

has to accept that group and recognize it, give it funds,

MR. McCONNELL:

The stipulation is that they

may not exclude based on status or beliefs.

position that it's all in favor of diversity, not only

MR. McCONNELL:

So --

Which is not the joint

The stipulation is that the purpose of the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Of course, that was not a

Your argument at its most fundamental

level is that religious organizations are different

22

because religion is all about belief.

don't we also have a tradition of separation?

different from that.

6

MR. McCONNELL:

The separation is between

MR. McCONNELL:

The written policy?

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The written policy -- when

20

it forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual

21

orientation was complied with by CLS because it would

22

not discriminate on the basis of orientation, only on

the basis of belief.

23

MR. GARRE:

This -- the

all-comers policy is how it's implemented in this

25

context.

And the written policy applies not only to the

guidance.

debate about what policy is at issue here.

deserved a two-sentence decision in the Ninth Circuit?

4

the wake of the Ninth Circuit's decision in Truth, which

5

had not only garnered a substantial panel decision but

6

had garnered serious consideration on -- on rehearing.

7

So this case, the Ninth Circuit properly concluded, was

8

controlled by the Truth decision.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

So in that respect --

So the answer is yes, this case

10

which is -- before us has produced hundreds and hundreds of

11

pages of amicus briefs, deserved two sentences in the

12

court of appeals?

13

MR. GARRE:

In the -- in the sense that it

14

was backed up by the Truth decision, yes.

But look at

15

the petition for certiorari in this case.

Nowhere did

16

fact that the bylaws may say we want students who are

As I recall, the only evidence in the

This case was litigated based on

JUSTICE ALITO:

Let's explore the

implications of this policy.

Suppose at a particular

campus there is a great deal of anti-Muslim animus.

And there’s a small Muslim group; it has 10 students.

6

If the group is required to accept anybody who applies

7

for membership, and 50 students who hate Muslims show up

8

and they want to take over that group, you say the First

9

Amendment allows that?

10

MR. GARRE:

Justice Alito, that’s the

11

claim, obviously, that the other side is making.

12

with respect, this example has never happened at

It -- yes.

We don't think that

that's the case here.

But if a policy is applied

evenhandedly -- unevenhandedly, in a viewpoint-neutral

way and it burdens religious groups, then there’s

5

common ground that that policy violates the

Constitution.

Of course, we think the policy here is --

JUSTICE ALITO:

If this were an employment

case, and when an employee is denied promotion the

employee said it's for reason A, and then after

wasn't for reason A, it was for reason B because of a

12

policy that we’ve long had, but there’s never --

13

there’s no written documentation of this new policy;

14

and then at a later point in the litigation the employer

15

says, well, it wasn't really either for reason A or

16

reason B; it was for reason C -- do you think that summary

17

judgment could be granted in favor of the employer on

the issue of pretext?
MR. GARRE:

19

I think that that would create a

20

factual issue and that that issue might well be tried,

21

Justice Alito.
And the one thing that is important to keep in

22

mind is that this is a request for injunctive relief and not

MR. GARRE:

It does.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The categories that are

listed there are the categories that under California

law are proscribed bases for discrimination?

20

MR. GARRE:

It does.

And that is an

additional basis for the school's policy.

Look at

California Education Code 66270.

prohibits discrimination in -- in programs and

educational activities by public schools like Hastings.

25

Hastings has an obligation under State law to prohibit

It explicitly

57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

2

reason why we’re here today is because CLS insisted

3

on the right to discriminate, to exclude students on the

4

basis of their sexual orientation.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

The

Well, section 66270 applies

6

to programs conducted by a post-secondary educational

7

institution, and your position is that if -- if a

8

religious group complies with your policies and then it

9

conducts religious services, those religious services

10
11

are conducted by Hastings?
MR. GARRE:

Our position is that the

12

registered student organization program is a program

13

of the university; it’s subsidized by the university;

14

it’s recognized by the university; and that all students

15

should be able to enjoy access to that program.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In your response to

17

Justice Ginsburg concerning California law, is it your

18

position that California law requires religious groups

19

to admit people who do not believe in their religious

20

beliefs and in fact to conduct services of that group?

21

MR. GARRE:

Your Honor, our position is that

22

the provision that we've cited to, 66270, does not carve

23

out an exemption in this program for a religious student

24

organization.

25

Several other points:

My friend twice in

his presentation stated that the all-comers policy is

24

simply their way of implementing the nondiscrimination

25

policy.

But if so, it is so absurdly overbroad as to be

11

What can --

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- how do I -- how do I

evaluate that?
MR. McCONNELL:

12

What you can say is that

13

Healy v. James requires a substantial justification for

14

exclusion of a student group from a registered student

15

activity forum, and this is not a substantial

16

justification; it is a silly justification.
