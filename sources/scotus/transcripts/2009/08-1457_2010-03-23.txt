CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

argument this morning in Case 08-1457, New Process Steel

v. The National Labor Relations Board.

Mr. Richie.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHELDON E. RICHIE

8

10
11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RICHIE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether the

12

National Labor Relations Board can continue to issue

13

adjudicatory decisions when its membership falls to two.

14

The National Labor Relations Act clearly states that at

15

all times, a quorum of the board will be not less than

16

three members.

17

The board's interpretation -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is it your position that

18

all of the actions of the board, including those taken

19

by the regional offices and by the general counsel and

20

by everybody else, is inoperative once -- once the

21

membership falls below three?

22

MR. RICHIE:

No, Justice Scalia,

23

particularly with respect to the general counsel, the

24

statute at 153(d) has a separate enumeration of -- of

25

obligations and powers and authority, so we don't think

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that that fails.

2
3

We also think that, with respect to certain
administrative type functions -­

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it has a separate -­

5

a separate authorization for these three -- three-person

6

adjudicatory panels as well, doesn't it?

7

MR. RICHIE:

It has -- it does,

8

Justice Scalia.

It does have a separate authorization

9

for panels of three or more members.

It does not have,

10

as in this case, a separate authorization for panels of

11

two members.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

Okay.

But that's a

13

different argument from the argument you were starting

14

off with, which, as I understood it, was once the

15

membership of the board falls below the quorum of three,

16

by reason of that, the three -- former three-member

17

panels, of which there are now only two left, cannot

18

act.

Is that your argument?
MR. RICHIE:

19

It is our argument that the -­

20

that once the membership falls below three, that the

21

National Labor -­

22
23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The membership of the

board?

24

MR. RICHIE:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm sorry, Your Honor?
The membership of the

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

board?

2

MR. RICHIE:

When the membership of the

3

board falls below three.

4

the membership of the group falls below three, that the

5

delegee group's authority to make adjudicatory decisions

6

lapses.

7

But we also believe that when

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I understood that argument

8

and I thought that was the only one you were making.

9

But you are making a broader one, that it also happens

10

whenever the -- whenever the board's quorum disappears.
MR. RICHIE:

11

You are correct,

12

Justice Scalia.

13

because of the first sentence of 153(b), which states

14

that the delegations have to be to members of three or

15

more members.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

16
17

We are making that argument.

It's

So the regional offices

can't function, of the NLRB?
MR. RICHIE:

18
19

function.

20

practices complaints.

21

decisions.

Well, we believe they can

They can receive, for example, unfair labor
They can't make adjudicatory

And we think that that is exactly what -­

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

MR. RICHIE:

Can the board pay salaries?

We believe they can, because

24

there is probably a different statute that enumerates

25

that, Justice Scalia, other than this statute with

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

respect to the authority with respect to adjudicatory

2

decisions.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm really reluctant to

4

rely upon this first argument that you are making,

5

because I really don't know what it does to all of the

6

functioning of the board.

7

MR. RICHIE:

Well, one of the --

8

Justice Scalia, one of the things that we think is clear

9

is that the remedy for fixing an undersized board is not

10

for the board to redefine itself and to read the

11

statute, but for Congress or the president to act.

12

there are many ways in which the president and Congress

13

could -- could fix the problem of an undersized board.

And

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

appeals said that the Act does two things.

16

said that the full board can delegate full powers to any

17

three-member group.

18

done here.

19

But here the court of
First, it

That was step one, and that was

And then it says there's this rule that a

20

quorum is three, but then it said:

21

these three-member groups that has been designated,

22

except, and there the quorum is two.

23

statute answer the question that, yes, a quorum is

24

three, except when it's two?

25

MR. RICHIE:

Except as to one of

So why doesn't the

Well, I think there is two

answers to that, Justice Ginsburg.

2

government -- the board takes the position, as they say

3

on page 29 in a footnote to their brief, that when a

4

delegate group possessed of all of the board's power

5

acts, it is acting as the board and not as an agent of

6

the board.

7

One is here the

So first, we would say that the second

8

quorum provision isn't even applicable to this group

9

that was established -- of members Kirsanow, Liebman and

10
11
12
13

Schaumber.

And so we think the three-member quorum -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

I didn't understand that.

Would you -- would you make that argument again?
MR. RICHIE:

Certainly, Justice Scalia.

The

14

government -- I'm sorry, "the government."

The NLRB in

15

its brief in footnote 21 on page 29, as well as in the

16

delegation, the minutes of the delegation in 2007, which

17

are found in our brief in the appendix on -- I think

18

it's pages 4a and 5a.

19

says in the footnote "When the delegee group possessed

20

of all of the board's powers," which is what we have

21

here, "acts, it is acting as the board and not as an

22

agent of the board.

23

become the board, as this group did, now you are subject

24

to that minimum three-member delegee -- three member

25

quorum requirement.

Both say that when -- the NLRB

So our position is that when you

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it's not an agent of

2

the board because the three-member group that has a

3

quorum of two has the full powers of the board.

4

statute doesn't say anything about a three-member group

5

that has a quorum of two being an agent of the board.

6

MR. RICHIE:

So the

It's a -- it's a group that is

7

delegated authority, and therefore, whether it's a full

8

delegation or partial delegation, we believe that the

9

common law principles of agency and principal make that

10
11

delegee group an agent.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But where does the

12

statute make that three-member group with a quorum of

13

two, a quorum of two, an agent?

14

designated to exercise any and all powers?

15

MR. RICHIE:

It says they may be

Justice Ginsburg, it does not

16

say the word "agent" in it.

But the delegation that

17

it's referring to is at common law a principal-agency

18

relationship.

19

delegation occurs that the -- in a normal situation,

20

because you could have a three-member group of four

21

members, a board of four or a board of five, and you

22

could have a group with three members.

23

delegation is made, it's our position and we believe

24

that this is the position that the D.C. Circuit took as

25

well, that that's an agent of the board.

So it's our position that once that

JUSTICE BREYER:

have a very direct answer to this question.

3
4

You should -- you should

Were you finished, because I don't want to
interrupt that train of thought?

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The D.C. Circuit I think

6

was the source of your opening argument because they

7

said when the number drops below three there is no

8

board, and I guess that's what your opening argument was

9

based on.

10

MR. RICHIE:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it did

11

say that.

But it also went on to say that it was

12

applying the rules, the common law rules of principal

13

and agency, and that when the board without three

14

members lost its authority to act, that the delegee

15

group to which the delegation was made also lost

16

authority to act.

17

happened.

18

had four delegate to three, and then two terms expired.

And in this case that's exactly what

We had a three-member board -- we actually

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

Well, just on this same

20

point before Justice Breyer I think moves to another

21

point.

22

and, as Justice Ginsburg has pointed out, except that

23

two members -- in its last phrase it uses the word

24

"quorum" twice:

25

constitute a quorum."

The statute does use the word "quorum" twice

"Except that two members shall
It doesn't say two members may

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

act.

2

MR. RICHIE:

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

Justice Kennedy -­
It says shall constitute a

quorum."

5

MR. RICHIE:

Justice Kennedy, I think we

6

have to start first -- and you are correct, there are

7

two quorum provisions, but "quorum" is not defined

8

differently.

9

that a quorum is the minimum number of members of a body

Quorum -- I think we agree within NLRB

10

necessary to transact business.

We have two different

11

bodies defined in this statute.

We have the board as

12

one body and we have the group as a different body.

13

so when the -- when the exception appears in the

14

statute, we agree again with the D.C. Circuit's

15

interpretation of that as simply defining two different

16

numbers of people necessary to fill out a quorum of

17

these two different bodies that are defined within the

18

statute.
JUSTICE BREYER:

19

And

Can you -- can you -- if

20

you are right, it seems to me you should have a very

21

clear, concise answer to the question that I'm just

22

going to ask you.

23

that there was no delegation, none.

24

members; is that right?

25

a vacancy.

And this is the question:

Imagine

Now we have five

One of them dies.

So there is

Now, can the remaining four exercise the

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

board's power?

2

MR. RICHIE:

Clearly.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Clearly.

Okay.

So what is

4

the difference between the situation I just described

5

and this situation where the Board simply delegated its

6

power to three people and one of them dies?

7

difference?

8

language.

9

What's the

I can't find any difference in the
So what is the difference?
MR. RICHIE:

Justice Breyer, the difference

10

is that in this statute there is a clear statement that

11

at all times the board must have a three-member quorum.

12

In your hypothetical there were still four members.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

MR. RICHIE:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Correct.

The board was still in place.
Except that two members

16

shall constitute a quorum of any group designated

17

pursuant to the first sentence, which says "The board is

18

authorized to delegate to any group of three all of the

19

powers which it may itself exercise. " So, what's the

20

difference?

21

MR. RICHIE:

Well, the difference is that

22

once the -- the difference between the hypothetical and

23

the situation we are in is that there were four members,

24

and the statute -­

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I know that, but I'm

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

asking why does that make a difference?

2

MR. RICHIE:

It makes a difference because

3

the statute requires that at all times the board shall

4

have a quorum of three members, a minimum quorum of

5

three members.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Except.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But isn't that tied to a

8

quorum for the board as a whole to act?

Once it's

9

delegated a responsibility to a three-member board, it's

10

already said, unless it takes another vote, that it's

11

going to let those three people decide.

12

understand the word "delegated" to mean it's given over

13

its power to a subgroup.

14

it needs a quorum to do that.
MR. RICHIE:

15

It has -- I

If it wants to take it back,
That's what I understand.

Well, I think the problem is,

16

Justice Sotomayor, that the delegation to a group of

17

three is indeed a valid delegation.

18

that.

19

what the -- what the board said, because member

20

Kirsanow's term expired in December, about 11 days after

21

the delegation.

22

board when they are delegating to the group, it says in

23

the minutes that they "are continuing to be a two-member

24

quorum of a three-member group," as if member Kirsanow

25

is a phantom .

We don't contest

But what we have here is a phantom group.

And

And if you look at the minutes of the

It's a fiction.

The group ceases to

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

exist and the board -- it's not just that the board

2

falls below three and the board ceases to exist with all

3

delegated powers to this group.

4

exist.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The group ceases to

to Justice Breyer's hypothetical.

8

statute.

9

happens to the fifth.

There's five members

Clearly they can delegate under the

Now there are only four members.

Something

Under your theory, the entity

10

that originally delegated no longer exists and therefore

11

the group, the entity that received the delegation of

12

powers, must cease, must cease to act.

13

MR. RICHIE:

Justice Kennedy, I -­

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If the quorum of three

15

that authorized two to act disappears and that means the

16

principal is no longer there, so the agent can't

17

exercise the authority, why isn't it the same when five

18

become four?

19

MR. RICHIE:

Well, we believe that the

20

reason that it isn't, Justice Kennedy, the same is -­

21

terrible sentence.

22

statute contemplates vacancies on the board and multiple

23

vacancies, so long as they don't go below three.

24

statute -- the vacancy clause in the statute doesn't

25

apply to a group at all.

It's not the same because the

The

So the delegating group in the

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

hypothetical clearly is still in place as the board

2

because it's the board that delegated.

3

still exists.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

And the board

As far as the interests of

5

your client are concerned, is there any functional

6

difference between what happened here and what could

7

happen very routinely even if the board had five

8

members, namely that after the case was assigned to a

9

three-member panel one of the three members of the panel

10

became unable to sit on that case, but the remaining two

11

members were able to reach agreement so the case could

12

be decided?
MR. RICHIE:

13

Justice Alito, the difference

14

is that here there was never a way to reconstitute this

15

board -- I'm sorry, the group -- as three members.

16

you have five or you have four members of the board and

17

a member of a three-member group is unable to perform

18

his or her function -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

Isn't there another

difference?

21

these panels can be appealed to the full board?

they automatically final?

could revise the decision of one of its panels.

than you believe it.

What is the case?

MR. RICHIE:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You've got to tell me more

The adjudication is final.
The adjudication is final.

Of the three-member group.
There is no appeal to the

full board?

8

MR. RICHIE:

That is correct.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then what is the reason --

10

I now see.

Your answer to my question is that the

11

vacancy clause applies to the full board but not to the

12

group.

13

MR. RICHIE:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

answer.

16

that way.

17

your favor.

That's correct, Justice Breyer.
Okay.

Now, got that

And now I see how you could read the statute
So, now I would like -- and that would be in

18

MR. RICHIE:

That's true.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

And -- and, therefore, I

20

would like to know, since you could also read it the

21

other way, why should it be read your way?

22

can think of a lot of reasons why not.

23

that Justice Scalia was raising:

24

to what remains effective, what doesn't, what about the

25

board staff decisions, which are, which aren't.

I mean, I

One is something

It may work havoc as

15
Alderson Reporting Company

I can

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

see a lot of reasons for not doing it.

2
3

But what are your best reasons for reading
that vacancy clause the way you want me to read it?

4

MR. RICHIE:

Justice Breyer, we -- we

5

believe that it is important to have a promote -- to

6

have a robust debate and an expression of -- a potential

7

for expression of dissent.

8

you have two members in a group and -- who have publicly

9

announced that on more than one occasion over the last 2

And what you have here is

10

years plus 3 months when this board has sat with only 2

11

members, that they have sometimes compromised their

12

opinions in the interest of the institutional purposes,

13

basically to keep the doors open.
And so you don't have a full and robust

14
15

debate.

You don't have the potential for an expression

16

of a dissenting view, and that's the -- that's the

17

distinction that we see.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

But the problem is that

19

that exists whether we read your rule or not in the way

20

you want.

21

three-member board could lose a member, a three-member

22

group could lose a member and its acts still be binding,

23

as long as you say there is -- there is three members on

24

the full board.

25

dissent exists any time there is a vacancy.

You have -- you've conceded that a

But this lack of opportunity for

16
Alderson Reporting Company

You just

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

don't like the system.

2

MR. RICHIE:

Justice Sotomayor, if we

3

consented that when there was an absence, a member who

4

dies, retires, is incapacitated, that the two members of

5

a properly constituted three -- three-member group could

6

still function, I certainly did not mean to say that.

7

We do not consent to that or agree with that

8

proposition.

9
10

What -- what somebody -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

You are now

saying that the group always has to be three members?

11

MR. RICHIE:

Yes.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That somebody can't die,

13

leave, recuse themselves from that group without

14

invalidating the actions of that subgroup.

15

statute do you read that limitation when it says a

16

quorum of two is okay to act?
MR. RICHIE:

17

Where in the

So I'm -- I'm a little confused.

MR. RICHIE:

In the statute, the group is

4

defined as -- the board is authorized, and I'm reading

5

from 153(b), Appendix 1a to our brief:

authorized to delegate to any group of three or more

MR. RICHIE:

"The board is

-- "any or all" -- that is

10

where we find it necessary that the group must contain

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

different argument from the one that relies upon the

size of the board, right?

It is, and we think it's an

We think there's multiple -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Even if the board were

18

still properly constituted and had a full five members,

19

if one of the three members to a -- a board should die,

20

it would no longer be a three-member board and could no

21

longer be, as your argument goes, the recipient of the

22

delegation, right?

23

MR. RICHIE:

That's correct, Justice Scalia.

24

But what's happened routinely for -- for 60 years since

25

1947 when Taft-Hartley was passed, is that what the

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

board did was it reconstituted the panels any time a

member died or retired.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There have been

4

situations before where the board dwindled to two

5

members.

6

continued to adjudicate the cases that they can, or when

7

there were prior periods with only two did the board

8

continue to adjudicate?

9

MR. RICHIE:

Is this the first time that the board has

This is the first time, yes.

10

For over -- from 1947 through 19 -- up to 2007, any time

11

the board fell to two members -- as far as we know, any

12

time the board fell to two members, the board

13

reconstituted -- I'm sorry.

14

two members, the board reconstituted the group to a

15

three-member group.
JUSTICE ALITO:

16

Any time a group fell to

There is a well-established

17

practice on the court of appeals that when a three-judge

18

panel for some reason loses one of the members due to a

19

death or resignation or recusal, the panel can continue

20

to decide the case if the remaining two judges can

21

agree.

22

situation is different with the NLRB for some reason?

23

Or do you think that that -- that those decisions on the

24

courts of appeals are unlawful as well?

25

And -- and do you see -- do you think the -- the

MR. RICHIE:

Well, Justice Alito, I think

19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it's a different statute.

2

the court of appeals, which is the delegating body that

3

forms the -- the three-member courts, still is in

4

existence.

5

But we also -- I also think

And if we just -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you are shifting

6

arguments.

You can't keep jumping back and forth

7

between the two arguments.

8

appointing body has to still be fully constituted, or at

9

least have a quorum, and the other one, which I thought

The one is that the

10

Justice Alito was addressing, is the quite separate

11

argument that the recipient of the delegation has to be

12

three.

And when it falls below three it's only two.
And I don't know that you have a response

13
14

to -- to -- to his point, with respect to the latter

15

argument, except -- except that it's a different

16

statute.

MR. RICHIE:

Well, Justice Scalia, it's a

different statute but it's also a very temporary and

19

limited circumstance.

23

Labor Relations Board.

25

You have a panel that was formed

Here you have got a delegation of all

JUSTICE BREYER:

So I would have thought,

but this is only me -- other people don't necessarily go

20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in for this kind of argument.

2

the -- the arguments in your favor, the one that sort of

3

resonated a bit with me was that this is a very

4

Republican Congress in 1947 that passed Taft-Hartley,

5

and one of the things they were really aiming at was to

6

move the board from three to five.

7

that that just doesn't happen.

8
9
10

And this is a way so

But I assume from the briefs filed that
there is no supporting legislative history for that,
what I've just said, so I better wipe it out of my mind.

11

(Laughter.)

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

But in thinking of the -­

If there is no legislative

history, it could be true.

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. RICHIE:

Justice Breyer, the legislative

16

history I think is -- there is no legislative history on

17

what happens when the board falls below two members.

18

But it is clear that from 1935 to 1947, the board was

19

made up of three members, and the statute clearly said

20

under the Wagner Act two members could be a quorum of a

21

three-member board.

22

In 1947 when Taft-Hartley was passed,

23

Congress intentionally increased the quorum and

24

increased the size of the board.

25

have only two members serve at any time as a two-member

If it had intended to

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

board, they would not -- that would be a strange way to

2

do it, in a statute that not only increases the size of

3

the board, but changes the minimum quorum requirement

4

from two to three.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

I was surprised by your

6

answer to -- I was surprised by your answer to one of

7

the earlier questions, because one of your amici says

8

that any member of the board, regardless of whether he

9

or she sits on the panel hearing a case, may request

10

that the case be heard by all five board members.

11

that -- is that not correct?
MR. RICHIE:

12

Is

That is correct, but that's to

13

hear it as opposed to overturn it once the decision is

14

made.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Heard an initial -- an

16

initial decision.

17

is in the court of appeals, right?

18
19
20

But just -- the review of the panel

MR. RICHIE:

That's correct,

Justice Ginsburg.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So you could have

21

initially a panel of five, but that would not be

22

reviewing the panel of three?

23

MR. RICHIE:

That's correct,

24

Justice Ginsburg.

25

would not review the three-member group's decision.

question, whether they -- they can review it before it

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL

18

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. KATYAL:

19
20

and may it please the Court:

21
22

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

We agree that the plain text controls this
case and there are three features to that text.

23

First, section 153(b) permits delegation of

24

any or all of the board's power to three or more

25

members.

Second, that section sets out a general quorum

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

rule of three members.

And third, as Justices Alito --

2

Justices Alito, Kennedy and Ginsburg have pointed out,

3

there is the phrase "except that" in the rule, a special

4

quorum provision that sets up panel quorums at two

5

members.
And in this case, faced with a vacancy

6
7

crisis, the board validly delegated its powers in

8

December 2007 to a three-member panel, and Petitioners

9

have never contested otherwise.

10

Rather, they argue that

when the board dropped it down to two members -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

Just before the third

12

member no longer became -- no longer was a member of the

13

board.

14

MR. KATYAL:

That's true.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So knowing when it gave it

16

to this three member panel that it would shortly become

17

a two-member panel, and that thereby the board would be

18

able to act with only two members instead of with three,

19

which is what the quorum requirement for the board is.

20

I must say that seems to be a very strange

21

procedure when you have a statute that says the board

22

has to -- has to have three for a quorum.

23

board sees, oh, God, we are about to lose our third

24

member, let's set up a three-member panel with this guy

25

who's about to go off.

When the

It will immediately become a

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

two-member panel and then we can act with only two

2

members.

That's wonderful.

3
4

It doesn't seem to you like an evasion of
the whole purpose of the -- of the quorum requirement?

5

MR. KATYAL:

I don't think so.

I think it's

6

precisely what was -- what the text allows, because it's

7

not, Justice Scalia, simply a three-member quorum

8

requirement.

9

"except that."

10

It's a three-member quorum requirement,

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Except -- may I just

11

interrupt a bit, just on the "except" clause at the very

bottom.

MR. KATYAL:

Well, Justice Stevens, the

But there is no group

around at the time they're -- that this case is being

10

decided, that was designated before.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

is focusing on what happens 2 years later.
MR. KATYAL:

And -- and with respect to 2

16

years later, I submit to you that that penultimate

17

sentence in 153(b) is met.

18

pursuant to the first sentence.

19

That is a designated group

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I don't know how you

20

could write the sentence without the "ed" unless you

21

want to say -- to make your point, if the statute had

22

been written the other way, to any group continuously

23

being designated.

24
25

MR. KATYAL:

Sure, I think you could say

something like constitute a -- that two members shall

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

constitute a quorum of any group that continues to meet

2

the requirements of the first sentence thereof, or

3

something like that.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

To read -- you can read the

5

language the way you want, that -- because of the

6

vacancy clause.

7

says "A vacancy shall not impair the right of the

8

remaining members to exercise the power."

9

in the absence of that clause, five to four, they

10

couldn't.

You see, there is a sentence there that

That implies

Okay?
Now, you say that clause applies to the

11
12

remaining members, i.e., to the three.

13

have three.

14

and you have to have three.

15

there's not -- there are not the remaining members, you

16

see.

17
18
19

And now we don't

And since we don't have three, there are -­

MR. KATYAL:
things about that.

Because they're not -­

Right.

So let me say a few

The first is -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

As long as there was

20

another member, you could -- you could do it.

21

without that remaining member, you can't.

22

MR. KATYAL:

But

So the first thing to say about

23

that argument, Justice Breyer, and it's one that

24

Justice Scalia brought up to my friend before -­

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. KATYAL:

2

argument.

3

153(b).

-- it is a totally different

It really does rest on the first sentence of

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

MR. KATYAL:

6

Yes.

And my friend admitted, it's a

totally new, different argument.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MR. KATYAL:

9

Yes.

presented.

Yes.

It's not in the question

It's not before the Court.

But were the

10

Court interested in it, I do think that the language of

11

the quorum provision, "quorum" meaning a number

12

sufficient to transact business, is the most relevant

13

language, and that suggests that two is enough so long

14

as you have that initial delegation to a group of three

15

and then one member drops off.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

Well, don't -- don't you

17

think it is significant that the -- the vacancy clause

18

that you were discussing -- where is it?

19

"A vacancy in the board shall not impair the right of

20

the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of

21

the board."

22

group not impairing the power of the group.

And it says nothing about a vacancy in the

23

MR. KATYAL:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

It's in (b).

The -- the -­
Which -- which buttresses,

it seems to me, the argument that when the group is no

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

longer a group of three the delegation is no longer

2

effective.

3

MR. KATYAL:

I don't think so.

The -- the

4

language is "A vacancy in the board -- in the board

5

shall not impair the powers of the remaining members of

6

the board."

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

MR. KATYAL:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

about the group.

Of the board.

And -­

But it doesn't say that

That's my point.

MR. KATYAL:

11

Of the board.

Well, but by definition,

12

Justice Scalia, the members that had been delegated this

13

power on December 20th are members of the board.

14

they are not -- they are not simply extraneous actors.

15

And so the vacancy clause, I think -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

No.

And

The -- this whole

17

passage distinguishes between the board and the group.

18

I mean, it's -- it doesn't -- it doesn't mean the group

19

when it says "the board" and the board when it says "the

20

group."

21

MR. KATYAL:

Well, I think it -- I don't

22

know that there is a distinction.

I think that there

23

when they say the board, it by definition includes the

24

group, because that is part of the board.

25

extraneous individuals.

Right?
The quorum -- well, except

8

that, Justice Scalia, it says -- it goes on to say that

9

the quorum is actually two.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Let -- let's say the

11

board delegates to a group the authority to act as the

12

board until December 31st, 2010.

13

2010, the group delegates to itself because it's acting

14

as the board the authority to act until December 31,

2011.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

All the powers of

the board until December 31st.
MR. KATYAL:

And then -- then I take it,

yes, they could exercise that delegation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

master in the master -agent relationship?

25

MR. KATYAL:

Under the statute.

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Now, there

Official - Subject to Final Review

may be other problems with it.

So 153(a), which is

2

found in our brief, in our government brief at page 10a,

3

sets out, for example, removal for cause.

4

members of a group were somehow -­

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And if some

No, no; they are

6

just -- you know, they make the distinction that the

board should continue to function.

8

MR. KATYAL:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

Yes.
Even though their

original delegation was limited to 2010 -­

11

MR. KATYAL:

Right.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- they, acting as a

13

board, get to delegate to themselves as the group the

14

authority to go beyond that.

15

MR. KATYAL:

Right.

I suppose that -- I

16

mean, it's not presented here but yes, I suppose that

17

would be permissible.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Now, what if the

19

board, consisting of five members -- let's say three

20

Democrats and two Republicans -- the three Democrats

21

delegate to a group the authority to act as a board.

22

They designate themselves as the members of the group.

23

They have at that point, authorized themselves to act as

24

the board with as little as two members, even though

25

they couldn't have done that as members of the board.

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

MR. KATYAL:

I think that's right,

2

Mr. Chief Justice, and it underscores that the statute

3

itself can't control all of those problems and whether

4

you set the quorum at three or two, even if you have a

5

full board of five, you can have these machinations that

6

are potentially -­

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Even though the

8

whole -- even though the whole purpose of expanding from

9

three to five was to ensure that more than two are

10

required for the board to act?
MR. KATYAL:

11

Well, I think that the purpose,

12

as the legislative history reveals, and it's set out in

13

our brief, was to increase efficiency and to have

14

overlapping panels adjudicating cases.

15

there's a -- there's ways to prevent your situation from

16

happening; that, and they include not just removal for

17

cause, which I think this would be the paradigmatic case

18

if three members of the body were trying to cut out two

members from doing their job.

If you

had one-party government and all of these factors

10

aligning in the way you are suggesting, you would have

11

the possibility that the circuit court's review under

12

If you could limit this to adjudications,

you would say, well, then they can't set major policy

that, particularly since the board has often set rules

So am I right in thinking that we have to

JUSTICE ALITO:

important ways?

Justice Scalia's first question of the argument, I -- I

9

think that it's possible.

I think that there is -- the

10

D.C. Circuit's reasoning is -- potentially could be read

11

so broadly as to say that the entire board goes poof and

12

everything under it, including the salaries.

13

I think if the Court were inclined to -- to

14

write a decision like that, we would try to look to, as

15

you mentioned before, the de facto officer doctrine and

16

the specific language of the delegations to the ALJ's

17

and the specific language to the general counsels, to

18

try to see if there is a way to preserve all of the

19

board's action in this circumstance.

20

Of course, that isn't before the Court at

21

this point, but I understand that the dramatic

22

consequences, potentially dramatic consequences of the
