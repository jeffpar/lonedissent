ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. RICHARD CORDRAY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. CORDRAY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Because this case arises under the

11

deferential standards of the AEDPA statute, Mr. Spisak

12

must show that the Ohio Supreme Court's decision was

13

contrary to Mills v. Maryland or that it unreasonably

14

applied Strickland v. Washington.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why?

I -- I have been

16

trying to figure out why the State court would know in

17

its decisionmaking that Mills commanded a different

18

result when Mills was issued after the State denied its

19

petition for rehearing.

20

MR. CORDRAY:

It's a bit of a conundrum,

21

Your Honor, because Mills was issued after the Ohio

22

Supreme Court's decision here, but before it became

23

final on direct review when cert was denied by this

24

Court in March of 1989.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, finality in that

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

sense is generally looked at in terms of AEDPA statute

2

of limitations.

3

question of whether a State has acted contrary to or

4

unreasonably in light of Supreme Court precedent when

5

the precedent didn't exist at the time it was rendering

6

its decision?

7

Why should the same rule apply to the

How can a court act?

MR. CORDRAY:

I'm perfectly willing, Your

8

Honor, to back it up a step and say Mills was not

9

clearly-established law at the time that the Ohio

10

Supreme Court decided, although the issues were current

11

at the time.

12

But I would go further and say the extension

13

of Mills that the Sixth Circuit's ruling made here is

14

not clearly-established law even today, more than

15

20 years later.

16

Circuits, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, Tenth, have

17

rejected the position the Sixth Circuit took here, and

18

in fact, this case is quite distinct from Mills even if

19

Mills were applicable.

20

I would agree with it that it's kind of tough to impose

21

on the Ohio Supreme Court Mills when -­

22

There is a -- the vast majority of

But I would take your point and

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We don't have to go any

23

further if we simply address the question, at what point

24

in time are we talking about a State court's decision,

25

correct?
4
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. CORDRAY:

Fair enough.

Fair enough.

2

Yes.

But I would say this case is distinct even from

3

Mills, where the Court determined that the jury

4

instructions gave the jury to believe that they could

5

only consider mitigating factors that they had

6

determined unanimously to be present.

7

none of that was done.

8

different, and in fact the jury was only instructed to

9

be unanimous on the ultimate question of whether the

And in this case,

The verdict form was quite

10

aggravators outweighed the mitigators, a common

11

instruction and one that's upheld around the country

12

consistently.

13

Second -­

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

General Cordray, under

15

the charge that was given, what happens if there is a

16

juror who thinks that the aggravating circumstances

17

don't outweigh the mitigating circumstances?

18

Ohio's current instruction that means no death penalty.

19

Under

But under the instruction that was given

20

here, that all 12 must agree on -- on the aggravators

21

outweighing the mitigators, what is the consequence of a

22

failure of the jurors to agree on that question?

23
24
25

MR. CORDRAY:

Even at the time, if the jury

effectively hung -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. CORDRAY:

-- on that question, the

2

consequence would be that the court would then impose

3

some version of a life sentence.

4

The issue is whether the jury was required

5

to be instructed that at the time, whether they were

6

required to be instructed something that might push them

7

away from unanimity.

8

in fact, in Jones v. United States the Court rejected

9

that rule in a ruling that was not dissented to by

This Court has never so held, and

10

anyone on the panel.

11

footnote 20 took no issue with the -- with the notion

12

that the jury did not have to be instructed in ways that

13

would push them away from rendering unanimous verdict on

14

the ultimate question.

15

Your dissent in that case at

Since that time, as a matter of State court

16

practice the Ohio Supreme Court in State v. Brooks did

17

say:

18

they later themselves rejected that that was required by

19

the Eighth Amendment in State v. Davis, and that also

20

has been the consistent holding of most circuits, that

21

that is not required.

22

We are now going to add that instruction.

But

If I could move -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It would be -- under the

23

charge that was given in this case, you say it would be

24

-- then the judge would be obliged to give one of the

25

two life sentences.

It would not be a deadlock

requiring a resentencing hearing.
MR. CORDRAY:

I believe that's the case at

the time, Your Honor.
At the time, the instructions pushed the

5

jury toward unanimity one way or the other.

Do the

6

aggravators outweigh the mitigators or do they not?

7

Since that time, the Ohio Supreme Court as a matter of

8

practice has been willing to go further and instruct the

9

jury, or have the jury be instructed, that if a single

10

one of you feels that the aggravators do not outweigh

11

the mitigators, that will preclude a death sentence.

12

But that has never been constitutionally

13

required by this Court.

It is an extension of Mills v.

14

Maryland that has never been so held by this Court, and

15

in fact is a source of a -- of a significant

16

overwhelming majority of circuits the opposite way.

17

If I could move to the -­

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Isn't your adversary's

19

position -- I'm sure they will speak for themselves, but

20

their position would be that this is a step further than

21

Jones or other cases because if in fact -- what you are

22

tilling us is that if the jury hangs, the court will

23

have to impose a life sentence or some form of it.

24
25

But the jury could believe that they could
-- that it's either death or life, and one holdout juror
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

would say:

2

because those are the only two choices and 11 people

3

want to go for dead -- death and I'm the only holdout, I

4

have to vote for death to make sure that he is

5

restrained in a way that I find acceptable.

6

Well, I don't want to let this guy out;

MR. CORDRAY:

This, as Your Honor notes from

7

your time on the trial court, is the jury dynamic in the

8

jury room.

9

here is whether the Constitution requires an instruction

It is the push towards unanimity.

The issue

10

to be given that would encourage a single juror to hold

11

out and try to avoid reaching a unanimous verdict.

12

Court has never held that that is constitutionally

13

required, and if they did so hold in this case it would

14

be an extension that is a new rule and would not be

15

applicable on AEDPA review here.

16

phase, defense counsel reasonably took the only tack

25

available to him.

His crimes were among the most

He used the sheer depravity of his

Alderson Reporting Company

2

story about his client's mental illness, and he asked

3

the jury to forego the death penalty for Mr. Spisak

4

because he is mentally ill and thus, under the

5

mitigating factor, lacked substantial capacity to

6

appreciate or conform his conduct to the requirements of

7

the law.

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

MR. CORDRAY:

10

General Cordray -­

That is not sufficient -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- in reading that

11

closing argument, it is disjointed.

12

tangents that have nothing to do with the sentence that

13

the defendant is getting.

I mean, it really is quite a

14

stream of consciousness.

And what's remarkable about it

15

is at no point did counsel say, give him a life

16

sentence.

17

either death or life would be acceptable.

18

It goes off on

He said that either one would be acceptable,

MR. CORDRAY:

First of all, I would disagree

19

with that characterization of the closing.

It was not a

20

perfect closing, but it had three identifiable pieces to

21

it.

22

recapitulate the nature of the crimes, something this

23

Court said in Yarborough is an acceptable defense

strategy.

The first was, he -- he did go back and

That's the elephant in the room.

The

crimes.

5

He was

The second piece of the closing -- this is

6

at petition appendix, approximately 339a to 344a, he

7

goes into the mitigating factor of mental illness.

8

had presented three mental health experts in the

9

sentencing phase to demonstrate that his client was

He

10

mentally ill.

11

there was a larger jar of not guilty by reason of

12

insanity that he had not been able to fulfill, even

13

though he had tried at trial, and that evidence had

14

ultimately been struck by the trial court, which found

15

they have not made out a defense of not guilty by reason

16

of insanity.

17

He had made a continued argument that

But he pursued the same theme here in

18

sentencing, presenting evidence and saying:

19

least fulfilled the smaller jar of mental illness,

20

diminished capacity to intend, and because we are a

21

humane society our general assembly has made that a

22

mitigating factor that you should apply here, and you

23

should not execute someone who has a diminished ability

24

to intend.

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

We have at

General Cordray, may I -­

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

may I -- you are basically arguing that he was not -­

2

not deficient in performance.

3

MR. CORDRAY:

That's right.

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Assume I am persuaded that

5

there was deficient performance, for all the reasons

6

your adversary argues, and I am focusing on the

7

prejudice issue.

8

argument that this guy would have gotten the death

9

penalty anyway.

I think you make a very strong

But what if -- what if the deficiency

10

had been even worse?

11

got up and said:

12

really think you ought to give him the death penalty -­

13

just outrageously sided with the prosecutor.

14

mean that we could still find no prejudice?

15

Supposing the defense counsel had

I wish I could make an argument, but I

MR. CORDRAY:

Would that

I think in Cronic the Court

16

said that if there is effectively a structural

17

breakdown -- I mean, if in fact counsel had gotten up

18

and argued solely a prosecution argument and not pivoted

19

at all to mitigating circumstances, perhaps it would be

20

possible to presume prejudice in that situation.

21

not the situation in this case.

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, I -- I understand

23

that.

24

whether Cronic or Strickland controls?

25

That's

But -- so you really are saying the question is

MR. CORDRAY:

That's one of the questions.
11

Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE STEVENS:

2

MR. CORDRAY:

Yes.

Although in our cert petition

3

question 2, we also argue that the Sixth Circuit erred

4

by not deferring to the Ohio Supreme Court's application

5

of Strickland v. Washington.

6

And on the prejudice issue, this is

7

Landrigan.

That is the case this Court decided and then

8

granted, vacated and remanded this case back to the

9

Sixth Circuit.

If you look at the prejudice discussion

10

in Landrigan -- and I would direct attention to the

11

quote near the end where the Court says that the court

12

of appeals panel got it right, and what they said was

13

that the -- the testimony was chilling.

14

Landrigan had repeated -- had committed repeated murders

15

and tried to kill again and again.

16

The person in

The same with Spisak in this case.

He had

17

been unrepentant in the court and in fact had flaunted

18

his menacing behavior, just as Spisak went on for days

19

on the stand expressing his white power views and how he

20

would continue to war if he had the opportunity, if

21

given the chance.

22

In Landrigan this Court approved the court

23

of appeals statement in the end that any further, minor

24

mitigating evidence that could have been presented in

25

And

10

the Ohio Supreme Court's basis for its decision was,

11

whether not competent, incompetence, or lack of

12

prejudice.

13

MR. CORDRAY:

I would say three things, Your

14

Honor.

15

where this Court said that the -- the determination

16

about deficiency and prejudice is doubly deferential

17

through the AEDPA lens.

18

said, to reasonable tactical decisions made in closing

19

argument, but we would be doubly deferential under AEDPA

20

because we have to hold that the Ohio Supreme Court's

21

rejection of the ineffectiveness claim was itself

22

objectively an unreasonable application of Strickland.

23

So that's one.

24
25

First of all, I would agree with Yarborough,

We would defer, as Yarborough

Number two, the Ohio Supreme Court did
reject this claim.

It cited Strickland v. Washington.

It did not go on in detail.

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

3

prong of Strickland it relied on, do we?

4

MR. CORDRAY:

But we don't know which

We don't.

But this is not a

5

case like Rompilla, where the -- where the Court was

6

faced with a court that had held only on one prong and

7

had disclaimed any attempt to review under the other

8

prong.

9

or summary disposition and doesn't specify which prong,

If the court simply gives a summary affirmance

10

I think the Court has to give deference under both

11

prongs, because the alternative would be to give

12

deference under neither prong, which is inconsistent

13

with the -- the AEDPA statement that we have to did

14

defer to an adjudication on the merits by a State court.

15

And so I think that is -- that is fair here.

16

certainly think -­

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But I

So you'd say a State

18

supreme court is entitled to more deference if it

19

doesn't tell us the basis for its decision?

20
21

MR. CORDRAY:

It -- it may seem a little

odd, Your Honor.

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

23

MR. CORDRAY:

Yes.

If they disclaim a prong, then

24

I think it's de novo review, and Rompilla did say that.

25

If they don't disclaim a prong, I think that the Court
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

has to defer because the alternative is it gives no

2

deference to summary dispositions, and -- and that has

3

been the general tenor of courts under AEDPA, is if

4

there is a question you err on the side of giving

deference.

18

But I think it's quite apparent

He at trial attempted to establish a

4

phase by bringing several mental health experts and

5

having them testify on the stand to show that at least

6

they had met the lower standard of mental disease or

7

defect under the Ohio Revised Code.

He renewed his effort at the sentencing

8

He then argued, perhaps not as eloquently as

9

-- as one might, you know, as -- as Justice Jackson once

10

said, you know, in their bed that night, but he argued

11

about:

12

some length about that.

13

and the jury had heard all that and clearly had that in

14

their minds.

15

arguments, in addition to days of presentation on the

16

subject, to say:

17

it is a mitigating factor; the General Assembly made it

18

a mitigating factor and we as a humane people should be

19

proud that we do not execute someone who has substantial

20

deficiency in ability to intend.

21

Yes, these crimes were brutal.

He went on at

-- the jury was going to hold against him and his

defense team their deficiency as counsel, because they

4

had made this effort to get not a -- a not guilty by

6

out.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Have you ever heard or read

8

a defense summation that was more derogatory of the

9

defendant than the summation here?

10

MR. CORDRAY:

I have not read a great number

11

of defense summations, but this was derogatory.

12

frankly, the bed that was made was made by his client,

13

who got on the stand for days on end and spewed his

14

racist propaganda, made it clear that he was not only

15

unrepentant but was triumphant; that one or more of his

16

murders were slick, pretty neat; that he celebrated the

17

killings; that he went out to kill again, that if he had

18

the opportunity now he would again go out to kill again.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

20

MR. CORDRAY:

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

But

But defense counsel -­
That's the context.
-- goes so far as to say:

22

Don't look to him for sympathy because he demands none.

23

But isn't that exactly what he has to appeal for in

24

order not to get a death verdict, sympathy based on -­

25

on mental illness, despite the horrific crimes that this
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

person committed and the things that he said on the

2

stand.

3

MR. CORDRAY:

No, Your Honor.

And I think

4

again counsel in the context of this proceeding judged,

5

perhaps rightly, that it was very unlikely this jury was

6

going to have sympathy for his client.

7

appealed to the jury's own sense of humanity and pride:

8

We have this mitigating factor under the law, we are a

9

civilized people, we do not execute people who have

Instead he

10

substantial diminished ability to intend; and I appeal

11

to you, you jury, even though I can sense that you are

12

not feeling sympathy for my client, do what -- what

13

makes you a humane people, what makes us proud as a

14

people, and do not give the death penalty to a person

15

who is sick, demented, twisted, as my client has shown

16

himself to be here on the stand.

17

I think it's a coherent strategy.

In fact,

18

I don't see easily how he could have done better.

19

as in Landrigan, if he had said, give him sympathy, give

20

him a life sentence, which was the thrust of the entire

21

proceedings, I don't think that that created -- that

22

lack of saying that created any prejudice on this

23

record, which was very thoroughly established, in part

24

by his client 's own testimony.

25

I would also say in Yarborough, on the
18
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

deficiency point, this Court said that focusing in on

2

one particular theme may well be a preferable strategy,

3

and there has to be broad deference given to closing,

4

which is only a part, after all, of the entire

5

sentencing proceeding, in that taking an understated

6

approach that -- that emphasizes the jury's autonomy.

7

In Yarborough, if you remember, the defense

counsel did not actually ask specifically in so many

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL J. BENZA

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

14

MR. BENZA:

Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The Sixth Circuit evaluated performance of

15

trial counsel in this case and found deficient

16

performance for three primary areas.

17

First, counsel presented and argued to the

18

jury nonstatutory aggravating factors as reasons to

19

impose the death sentence on Mr. Spisak.

20

jury is allowed to consider only the statutory

21

aggravator factors, not nonstatutory factors.

22

counsel specifically identified and argued four reasons

23

to execute Mr. Spisak.

In Ohio, the

The

24

He then proceeded to tell the jury what was

25

not mitigating evidence in this case, including factors

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that have long been accepted as mitigating factors like

2

performance in prison, adaptive skills and the issue

3

regarding his family upbringing and childhood.

4

Finally, the lawyer turned to what he argued

5

was the only mitigating evidence that they were going to

6

be arguing, and that was the issue of the client's

7

mental health.

8
9

He then -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You say -- you fault

him for not talking about performance in prison,

10

prospective performance in prison?

MR. BENZA:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That is correct.
It doesn't look like

13

that's going to be a very strong argument.

14

is still talking about people he wants to kill, and you

15

are going to get up there and say he might perform well

in prison?

17

MR. BENZA:

I mean, he

health evidence.

20

testimony of the mental health experts, including

21

Dr. Resnick, who is the court clinic psychiatrist, who

testified that while he has been incarcerated and

illness has resided -- that he has gotten better.

particular people he wanted to kill?

MR. BENZA:

That is correct, it did.

And the jury is

prison?

health experts, that would have been the case.

And this was

But I guess it gets

5

back to the -- the point, we are talking about what a

6

jury would think and isn't it possible.

suggesting, I think, he -- he should grasp any straws

8

that are there, this might help.

9

that that would have a negative effect on the jury?

You are

But isn't it possible
In

10

other words, they see this lawyer telling them this guy

11

is going to do well in prison and the lawyer's

12

credibility is -- is shot.

MR. BENZA:

If there is no evidence to

14

support that, that would be correct.

The problem that

15

this case presents -- and this is what the Sixth Circuit

16

found -- that had the lawyer then said, yes, for all of

17

these reasons they may weigh in favor of death, but here

18

are the reasons why you should consider life, we would

19

have a very case than we have here today.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Benza, do you know of

21

any case where ineffective assistance was found on the

22

basis of a closing argument alone?

24

witnesses to testify to the defendant's mental illness,

25

and that he did play that theme in the closing.

Do you know of any case where the closing,

No.

testimony, and that's what they said.

3

MR. BENZA:

He -- what he should have done

4

is what this Court recognized in Penry v. Lynaugh, is

5

that mental health evidence is a double-edged sword.

The job of the defense lawyer is to explain why the

mental health evidence mitigates the crimes -­

He's not crazy enough to meet the standard of

State court that found it okay.

MR. BENZA:

For whatever reason we had the

We have no

The issue is, however, once the lawyer

Alderson Reporting Company

decided that this was the mitigation strategy that he

2

was going to present, this was the evidence that he had

3

available to argue to him, it is the role of the defense

4

counsel to advocate.

5

So once the lawyer makes the strategic

6

decision, I am going to present the closing argument

focused -- based on mental health mitigating evidence,

8

then the lawyer's job is to stand up and explain to

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I agree with all that

you are saying.

12

is why wasn't this advocacy, when indeed a reasonable

decision as to what constituted advocacy in those really

14

rare circumstances where it was the worst kind of

15

defendant he had ever seen in his life who deserved no

16

sympathy?

What I am saying my hard time is here

MR. BENZA:

As the amici points out, there

is no strategic reason for this closing.

there can be no strategic reason to have provided this

which the defendant takes the stand with a Hitler

How many cases have you had like that?

11

MR. BENZA:

No.

Spisak is the only one like

that.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This was an extraordinary

trial, and it seems to me that the -- that the technique

of that strategy was substandard?

get Mr. Cordray's very succinct explanation, you have to

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

that you have -- the best case that you have, maybe a

case in the courts of appeals or the state supreme

courts, where it is said that the implementation of the

11

strategy was just inept -- totally inept.

12

I mean, is that what your argument is here?

13

MR. BENZA:

Yes, that the application, that

14

the way the lawyer delivered the closing, the themes

15

that he identified, the things that he said, was the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Again, that depends on,

20

trying to be folksy with the jury, obviously.

21
22
23

These are things that are very difficult for
us to assess.
MR. BENZA:

They are very difficult, but

this case doesn't present those nuances.

presents the case where the lawyer stands up at closing

2

have made this worse was Justice Stevens hypothetical of

It's the only thing he didn't say in his

closing that could have possibly made it worse for the

client.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, he actually did

say that.

9

MR. BENZA:

10

Not in those words.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, but, pretty much,

11

he said, no one's going to fault you if you impose the

death sentence.

MR. BENZA:

And we will be proud of you,

whichever you do.

you to execute him as well, did not escape his lips.

16

Only those very words, I would like

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But, I mean, it

17

seems to me that you are imposing a strategic rule, and

18

the counsel obviously made a decision -- or the record

19

may reflect that the type of advocacy that you are

20

telling us he has to have.

21

Here's why you should give this guy

22

sympathy.

Here's why.

Here's -- he's a good guy.

23

mean, there is -- even standing at that podium, there is

24

a different strategy that people sometimes employ, which

25

is sort of the understated -- you know, well, he did

Alderson Reporting Company

I

some terrible things, don't -- I'm not asking for

2

sympathy for these things, but -- you know, we are very

3

proud of the fact that we don't execute -- you know, it

4

seems to me that this disagreement is over different

5

styles of advocacy.

6

And I don't know how to -- particularly in a

7

case where you don't have much to work with, I don't

8

know how to make a judgment that his choice was worse

9

than the other.

10

MR. BENZA:

But that's what we do under

11

Strickland.

12

analysis, that there are multiple ways that various

13

lawyers will try the same case; all of which can be

14

effective.

15

The court recognizes, in Strickland

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You just told me that,

16

under Strickland, under anything, there has been no case

17

in which there has been a decision for the defendant,

18

based on the inadequacy of the closing argument alone.

19

So you are asking us to take a new tact and

20

inviting arguments focused exclusively on the closing

21

argument, to see if it meets the Strickland standard.

22

MR. BENZA:

Yes, but this court has already

23

recognized that the Sixth Amendment applies, the right

24

to counsel applies at closing argument.

25

In Yarborough v. Gentry, at page 5 of this
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Court's opinion, the Court specifically stated that the

2

right to effective assistance extends to closing

So this is not a redevelopment or an

expansion of Strickland.

Why -- why isn't it the

Strickland analysis that you read the charge in the

10

context of the case that was presented at trial, and,

11

here, the case was.

12

The only thing going for the defendant were

13

the witnesses to his mental illness and whether,

14

eloquently or not, that theme was played to the jury.

15

This is a mentally ill man.

16

MR. BENZA:

That's -- that's correct, and

17

that's the theme that defense counsel said he was going

18

to implement at the closing.

lawyer was to adequately and effectively make that

20

closing to the jury.

25

rambling.

I haven't argued these things to juries, and I

I didn't think it was rambling.
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

I thought he was trying to spend a lot of

2

time explaining away to the jury some prosecutorial

3

remark, that you shouldn't pay attention to the expert

4

because you, yourself, the lawyer, didn't talk to them

5

enough.

6

And so you describe that for a couple of

7

pages and why it was irrelevant, and the reason he

8

talked about the -- I thought, the reason he talked

9

about the -- how you will feel when you go out of here,

10

is because he recognizes this is the most sensational

11

case in this community, ever, and all your neighbors are

12

going to congratulate you.

13

But what you are doing here is you are

14

applying a standard, and you are proud to be an

15

American, and that standard, as an American, is a humane

16

standard that requires you to not give the death penalty

17

when the man's insane.

18

Now, I agree that he repeated that 7 or 8 or

19

9 or 10 times, but it was the same point over and over.

20

And how can I -- since there is a lower court that

21

seemed to find this adequate, how can I sit here and say

22

it wasn't?

23

MR. BENZA:

Well, it -- first, as to the

24

question of whether or not the lower court found it

25

adequate, we have no idea, again, what the Ohio Supreme

If we assume that they were then

applying the Lockhart v. Fretwell standard as to the

for prejudice.

Why would we assume that?

Well, because we don't know what

the Supreme Court actually did.

MR. BENZA:

on what basis the lower court took action.

it was a lawful basis.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That's the rule on direct

appeal, of course, not on collateral.

3

MR. BENZA:

That is the rule on direct

4

appeal.

5

The problem that you have in that is, when you try to

6

apply AEDPA to this particular claim, you don't know how

7

the state court, in fact, decided this case.

8
9

It is also the implication of applying AEDPA.

And, therefore, you don't know whether or
not you are going to give the AEDPA deference to the

10

decision that there was no deficient performance, that

11

there was no prejudice.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

How -- how does that work?

13

Certainly, it's a fairly common thing, that the

14

defendant will make -- let's say, 20 arguments, maybe he

15

would even number them.

16

And it's fairly common to find a court of

17

appeals in a state that says, as to argument number 17,

18

and then they characterize it, we reject that argument.

19

MR. BENZA:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

That is true.
Now, that -- that happens

all the time.

22

MR. BENZA:

That is correct.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

And, now, it's very, very

24

common that, in making that argument, there could be

25

some good grounds for rejecting it, and there could be
35
Alderson Reporting Company

some bad grounds for rejecting it.

2

So would we send -- do we send every case

3

like that back, to say, I want to know if you rejected

4

it for a good reason or a bad reason?

5

MR. BENZA:

I would think, no, that you

don't send it back, but what happens -­

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

What we do is we assume

they did it for a bad reason?

9

MR. BENZA:

I would -- I think the issue

10

then would become that, when a state court chooses to

11

summarily deny, without evaluation, an explanation of

12

the merits of the claim, that, when it comes to habeas

13

review, the constraints of AEDPA are lifted.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So the Ohio Supreme

15

Court, faced with 67 issues, would have to write at

16

least a per curiam opinion on each of the 67 to insulate

17

itself against being overturned on federal habeas?

18

MR. BENZA:

Not insulate from overturning,

19

20

of habeas.

Because, I mean, I'm not positive of this one,

opinions and district court opinions would grow by an

5

order of magnitude, because it's very common to see

12

MR. BENZA:

No, this Court has never

13

addressed how to apply 2254(d) to a summary decision.

14

In Knowles v. Mirzayance, the Court noted that this was

15

in fact an issue and reserved that for another day.

16

In Early v. Packer, this Court recognized,

17

though, however, that AEDPA constraints are looking at

18

not just at the outcome of the lower court's -- the

19

State court's decisions, but the reasoning behind it,

20

because if you are going to have an unreasonable

21

application of -- of a binding law from this court, the

22

lower courts have to be able to apply it and explain,

23

how did we apply it?

24

State court would be insulated from Federal habeas

25

review, making the writ available but unavailable.

Otherwise every decision of the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if you're -- if

you're right about that issue on which we haven't had a

given the deference that it is due, and that is that we

going to start doing this for State cases, wouldn't I

MR. BENZA:

that would continue on in habeas review of these claims,

is evaluating the State court decision without, though,

simply saying, well, we're going to -- and this is what

7

happens in the lower courts.

summary decisions in 2254(d) analysis, those circuits

9

that have applied this say, what we will imagine a way

10

in which the State court could have reasonably applied

11

this law to reach this result, and therefore, since that

12

is a reasonable way, because of course we as Article 3

13

judges have reasonably come up with that, it must be

14

reasonable, it's not an unreasonable application, and

15

the writ is denied.

16

When you have these

The problem that we face is when you look at

17

that in comparison to cases like Wiggins and Rompilla

18

where the State courts affirmatively denied applying

19

Federal standards, you get a different level of review.

And so you end up encouraging State courts in these

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If you see these

Mr. Benza, you might want

to use what time is remaining to deal with the other
issue, which we haven't talked about at all.
MR. BENZA:

If I may, if I'm turning -- if

12

there are no further questions on the effect, I will

13

turn to the Mills issue.

14

The -- the question in front of the Sixth

15

Circuit was whether or not the totality of the jury

instructions in this case were such that they violated

Mills' directive that an individual jurist's

determination of a mitigating factor's existence could

19

not be precluded from being considered by the injection

of that -- of those factors by the other 11 jurors.

21

What you have in this particular case is the

22

totality of the jury instructions were such that a

23

reasonable understanding of the instruction was that the

24

jury had to be unanimous as to the understanding and the

25

existence of a mitigating factor before it could even be

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what is your answer to

3

the first question that Justice Sotomayor asked?

4

of you say that -- that the State court's decision was

5

contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of

6

clearly-established Federal laws determined by the

7

Supreme Court of the United States, i.e., Mills v.

8

Maryland, when Mills v. Maryland hadn't been decided.

9

MR. BENZA:

Half

In Terry Williams v. Taylor,

10

this Court recognized in the opinion authored by Justice

11

O'Connor that the issue for contrary to or unreasonable

12

application is going to be governed by the

application of Teague.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Does Teague say anything

about time?
MR. BENZA:

Teague says that the decision

for application of a newly established law or a new

established constitutional rule is predicated on the

13

denial of direct appeal, which in this case would be the

14

cert denied by this Court of the direct appeal of the ­

case, which happened in 1989, a year after the decision

16

in Mills was handed down.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, the Mills

18

opinion has one of those concluding paragraphs at the

19

end that sort of sums everything up, and it says that we

20

conclude there is a substantial probability that

21

reasonable jurors upon receiving the judge's

22

instructions in this case and in attempting to complete

23

the verdict form as instructed may have thought they

24

were precluded from considering any mitigating evidence

25

unless all 12 jurors agreed on the existence of a

MR. BENZA:

That is correct.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Now how is that

clearly established law that your claim is -- is

5

contrary to Mills?

MR. BENZA:

16

MR. CORDRAY:

Okay.

I am simply summarizing a

17

response to Justice Sotomayor's question.

But this

18

Court -- on -- on Teague, in Beard v Banks determined

19

that Mills itself expressed a new rule and expressed

some doubt as to whether that rule itself was even clear

21

until McKoy v. North Carolina was decided in 1990, which

22

was to finality in this case.

The reference to page 326a and the jury

aggravators outweigh mitigators.

This was very

10

different from the jury form in Mills which was itself

11

was somewhat cryptic and -- and later was explained

12

further in McKoy.

13

If I could return then to the

14

ineffectiveness issues.

Counsel argued that there was

15

deficiency on a couple of different grounds.

16

all, that -- that defense counsel should have argued

17

about family background and performance in prison.

family background was uncontested; it was humdrum; there

was nothing special there.

I am not going to foul the record with his specific

his response was to say "Heil, Hitler" and give the Nazi

3

So the notion that we should be referring

4

back to his performance in prison and that somehow would

5

have helped mitigate the jury's consideration of the

6

death sentence to me is -- is fanciful.

7

In terms of the argument that defense

characterization that I don't think is accurate and it's

10

not accurate as a matter of Ohio law.

11

brief we cited State v. Hancock which indicates that the

12

nature and circumstances of crimes are always relevant

13

in determining whether the aggravators outweigh the

14

mitigators, and in fact the main aggravator here was

15

that Mr. Spisak engaged in a course of conduct that

16

involved the purposeful killing of more than one person

17

-- two or more persons, or the attempt to kill two or

18

more persons which he had done here and which certainly

19

was going to be and was, in fact, in fact if you read

20

the prosecutor's closing, the heart and soul of the

21

prosecutor's closing.

22

In our reply

As to whether the mental health presentation

23

was, quote, "not strong enough," obviously it wasn't

strong enough in the end to sway the jury.

The court said that

And then in Yarborough as applied to closing

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What -- what is your

11

answer to your friend's explanation that it's hard to

12

defer when they don't even say anything?

13

MR. CORDRAY:

I think that we have to read

14

the statute.

15

says we defer to what?

16

the State court on the merits.

17

here that this adjudication was on some procedural

18

grounds or default grounds.

19

adjudication.

20

long explained adjudication, but it was an adjudication

21

on the merits and deference should be given.

22

The statute -- the AEDPA statute, 2254
We defer to an adjudication by
There is no suggestion

It was a merits

It wasn't a lengthy, eloquent, you know,

The alternative is that if they don't

23

explain which prong they are using that you defer to

24

nothing, and that seems to be not consistent with what

25

Congress clearly intended under AEDPA, nor is it
55

1

consistent with the language of the statute.

2

The claim was made that the deference only

3

applies when the State court, quote, "has done its job."

4

Under the statute the job is to adjudicate a claim on

5

the merits, not to provide a lengthy discourse in doing

6

so.

7

decisive and was the basis on which this Court GVR'd

8

in -- in Landrigan, this is Landrigan -­

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

10

that one point for a minute.

As to the prejudice point which I think is finally

11

MR. CORDRAY:

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Can we just go back to

Yes, sir.
Would your deference be

13

exactly the same if, instead of listing all 47 claims or

14

so, they simply entered a one-line order saying,

15

"Affirmed"?

16

MR. CORDRAY:

I believe, Your Honor, under

17

the statute, it would be the same, although here they

18

did more than that -- you know, they cited Strickland.

19

We have to assume they applied Strickland.

20

And, as for the prejudice claim, we have

21

findings from the Ohio Supreme Court that, I think, bear

22

on the prejudice claim.

23

309(a) through 311(a) of the appendix -­

24

JUSTICE STEVENS:

25

In its decision -- this is

Let me -- let me go back

to the question.

1

MR. CORDRAY:

Yes, sir.

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do you think they are

3

entitled to more deference because they did cite

4

Strickland if they -- than if they did cite nothing?

5

MR. CORDRAY:

I think that the Ohio Supreme

6

Court is entitled to deference because it adjudicated a

7

claim on the merits, so -­

8
9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So it would be exactly the

same deference whether they say it's Strickland or not.

10

MR. CORDRAY:

I would agree with that.

11

However, if the Court was inclined to make gradation -­

12

this is a gradation beyond simply an unexplained order.

13

Yes.

14

As to prejudice, the Ohio Supreme Court at

15

309(a) through 311(a) itself independently reweighed the

16

aggravating factors against the mitigating factors,

17

which is something the Ohio Supreme Court does under

18

Ohio law.

19

There had been some issues of merger of some

20

of the aggravating circumstances.

On direct appeal,

21

they had dealt with those issues, and then they went

22

back and reweighed, and they found that, on this record,

23

the aggravating factors heavily -- lie heavily and

24

beyond a reasonable doubt to outweigh the mitigating

25

factors.
57

1

That is, in fact, the same kind of

2

determination that the Court would make in trying to

3

determine if there was prejudice here.

4

As to the implementation of the strategy

5

here, it is coherent in understanding what counsel was

6

trying to do.

7

Was it a bit rambling?

Perhaps.

You know, were there -- were there side

8

issues that he tried to take up, which he thought went

9

to his credibility with the jury and the credibility of

10

the mental illness defense with the jury?

11

But the strategy was twofold.

Perhaps.
It was to

12

reference the crimes, make it clear to the jury he

13

understood the nature -- the horrific nature of the

14

crimes, as he thought the jury understood it, and then

15

pivot to the mental illness -- mental disease or defect

16

prong as the mitigator that the -- that the jury should

17

apply in not giving the death penalty in this case.

18

I think the strategy here was coherent.

19

not sure what else defense counsel could have done in

20

this case, where his client had both committed these

21

horrific crimes, undisputed, and then had reveled in

22

them, in his flamboyant testimony from the stand.

I'm

23

In the context of that and given the doubly

24

deferential lens this Court has laid out in Yarborough,

25

I think that there is neither deficiency, nor could
