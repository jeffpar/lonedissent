CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Nager.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GLEN D. NAGER

We’ll hear argument

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. NAGER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
In this case, the Court of Appeals for the

12

Seventh Circuit held that an agreement of the 32 teams

13

of the National Football League was immune from any

14

scrutiny under section 1 of the Sherman Act on the

15

ground that the agreement allegedly fails the

16

plurality of actor requirement of this Court's

17

jurisprudence.

18

The 32 teams of the National Football League

19

are separately owned and controlled profit-making

20

enterprises.

21

well as the Court's more general joint venture

22

jurisprudence, those clubs are entities whose distinct

23

agreements are, indeed, subject to section 1 scrutiny.

24
25

Under this Court's decision in NCAA, as

The fact of the matter is there is a long­
standing consensus, judicial and legislative, that

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

agreements among sports teams about whether and how

2

they will participate in the marketplace is subject to

3

scrutiny under the Sherman Act, section 1.

4

The Court's decision in NCAA is most

5

directly on point.

In that case, the Court held that

6

a policy of the NCAA that restricted the ability of

7

member institutions of the NCAA to sell TV rights

8

violated section 1.

9

decisions of the NCAA were ultimately controlled by

Just as with the NFL, the

10

the vote of its members, and for that reason, the

11

Court held that the NCAA policy was a horizontal

12

restraint, and it --

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But there was no joint

14

venture with respect to the television rights, meaning

15

there was no separate activity, other than the

16

televising of the shows at issue.

17

General is saying there is a joint venture, and it has

18

to do with the licensing of trademarks, with their

19

quality control, et cetera.

Here, the Solicitor

20

Isn't that a substantial difference?

21

MR. NAGER:

No, I don't -- I don't think so,

22

because what we’re -- what we’re asking about here is

23

-- is the question of whether or not the agreement of

24

the teams involves a plurality of actors.

25

in NCAA, the members' institutions -- because they

4
Alderson Reporting Company

And just as

Official

1

controlled the operation of the NCAA and the policy

2

that it was promulgating, there was a plurality of

3

actors.

4

So, too, here, the 32 teams of the National

5

Football League have entered into an agreement and

6

control the use, collectively, of the trademarks and

7

logos of the individual teams.

8

there is concerted activity that is involved.

9

And for that reason,

Justice Sotomayor, the point that you raise

10

might be of -- a point of difference that the NFL

11

could argue in the context of an ancillary restraint

12

analysis, in the context of a rule of reason analysis,

13

but it’s not a point of distinction that they can

14

argue properly in the context of the concerted conduct

15

inquiry.

16

The NCAA case simply applies the consistent

17

teachings of this Court in cases like Sealy, BMI, and

18

Copperweld, that separately owned and controlled

19

entities entering into agreements -- those agreements

20

constitute concerted conduct subject to scrutiny under

21

the antitrust laws.

22

The --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Does that cover

23

everything that the NFLA does?

Because everything is

24

subject to agreement.

25

is everything under the Sherman Act, and then it goes

It's all concerted action.

5

So,

1

to rule of reason analysis?

2

that escape, entirely, antitrust analysis?
MR. NAGER:

3

Or are there some things

Certainly everything in the --

4

that’s challenged in this case, because this involves

5

a restriction on the activities of the venturers

6

themselves.

7

answer your question, Justice Ginsburg, to say that

8

yes, that everything that these 32 separately owned

9

and controlled teams joined together to do by -- in

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

11

Changes in the -- in the

12

rule apply?

They make a change to make it -- give

13

the passer more protection, but there's -- this really

14

hurts certain teams, which mostly run, and so -- rule

15

of reason?
MR. NAGER:

16

Yes, it is concerted activity.

17

I don't think it would be a plausible rule of reason

18

claim.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
litigation system.

Well, how -- you know the

How do we know?

MR. NAGER:

Well, I think we know the

22

following, Justice Kennedy:

That under this Court's

23

rule of reasons jurisprudence, a plaintiff has to be

24

able to plead an identifiable anticompetitive effect

25

in a market in which the defendant plausibly has

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

market power, and the -- the plaintiff also has to be

2

one who can --

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, my -- my

4

hypothetical:

Two or three teams which aren't

5

particularly popular in the league are hurt by the

6

rule change.

And --

7

MR. NAGER:

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

And notice, there’s --

that the owners sit around the room, they are liable

10

for a conspiracy.

11

Triple damages.

12

That --

I mean, this is serious stuff.

I don't -- and my question, really, was the

13

same as Justice Ginsburg’s.

14

where we are sure a rule of reason inquiry will be --

15

would be inappropriate?

16

summary judgment.

17

of section 1 carve-out for joint action, then -- then

18

everything is under the rule of reason.

19

Can you give us a zone

We can take care of it on

Because if you don't have some sort

MR. NAGER:

Well, Justice Kennedy, let me

20

answer your question in two parts.

21

the extent that the Court is looking for a zone, the

22

concerted conduct doctrine is the wrong place to do

23

it, because remember, if something is deemed not to be

24

concerted conduct, it is a per -- then it's per se,

25

not subject to section 1 and per se legal.

7
Alderson Reporting Company

First of all, to

And I

Official

1

think for the Court's jurisprudence over the last

2

30 years, the Court has been trying to get out of per

3

se rules and have a more focused inquiry into what the

4

anticompetitive effects and pro-competitive effects of

5

a particular restraint are. The concerted conduct

6

doctrine would be a very blunt tool to use for that

7

purpose.

8
9

Now, that is not to say -- and I appreciate
your question -- in the NCAA case itself, where

10

conditions of competition and the like were raised,

11

Justice Stevens's opinion for the Court says that in

12

contrast to the TV restraint, these other types of

13

rules and regulations of the sports league are

14

presumptively competitive, pro-competitive,

15

presumptively favorable to consumers, because they are

16

integral and bound up with the creation of the

17

football venture itself.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, let me give you

19

another example that you mention in your brief.

The

20

NFL teams agree among themselves regarding scheduling:

21

They’ll play 16 games a year and they will have a

22

playoff schedule and they won't play any other games.

23

Now, would that be a clear case under the rule of

24

reason?

25

that, for example, the English football leagues

You mention and some of your amici mention

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

operate very differently.

2

MR. NAGER:

Justice Alito, if I -- I may not

3

have gotten all of your question, but let me answer it

4

in two parts.

5

ventures to maximize output.

6

ventures to maximize competition.

7

prohibit people entering into contracts from

8

unreasonably restraining trade.

9

The antitrust laws do not require joint
They don't require joint
They simply

So a mere agreement among the team owners

10

that they would have a 14-game schedule rather than a

11

16-game schedule is not a prima facie showing of an

12

anticompetitive impact, because all it's showing us is

13

what the joint venturers have done with their own

14

output.

15

market-wide reduction in output.

16

question you were saying, in addition --

17

They have -- you haven't alleged a

JUSTICE ALITO:

Now, if by your

Well, what if one of the

18

team wants -- one of the teams wants to play

19

additional games --

20

MR. NAGER:

Well --

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- against a rival team

22

where they will get more money?

23

MR. NAGER:

What I -- what I was going to

24

jump right to is:

If in addition to changing the

25

league schedule, the team owners in concert agreed to

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

prohibit the teams of the National Football League

2

from -- from playing any other games -- doing an

3

exhibition game in Japan, the Redskins and the Giants

4

playing another game -- that might show a market-wide

5

reduction in output.

6

says very specifically that the most important

7

condition of ensuring the competitiveness of joint

8

ventures is ensuring the freedom of the individual

9

venturers to produce output, increase output.

10

And the Court's decision in NCAA

Now, that doesn't mean that a league rule of

11

that type would be unlawful.

12

suggest is if, in addition to changing the schedule of

13

games for the league, they also imposed a restriction

14

on the individual venturers from producing additional

15

games on their own, we might have something that

16

looked more like a plausible rule of restraint --

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All I'm trying to

They couldn't -- they

18

couldn't stop that team from joining another league?

19

Let's assume -- and I -- you know, I don't know enough

20

about football, but let's assume there are two leagues

21

playing.

22

plays on Sunday.

23

couldn't stop their members from joining that other

24

league?

25

-- if you are free to reject it and go to somewhere

One of them plays on Saturday and the other
You’re suggesting that the venture

What's the purpose of being in a venture if

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

else?

2

MR. NAGER:

What I'm saying is, first of

3

all, it would plainly be concerted activity on the

4

part of the team owners because they would have

5

entered into a horizontal restraint on the activity of

6

the venturers.

7

restraint violated the antitrust laws, one would have

8

to go through the following analysis, Justice

9

Sotomayor:

10

Whether or not that horizontal

First, we would ask whether or not that

restriction is an ancillary -- an ancillary restraint.
And an ancillary restraint, starting with

11
12

Judge Taft, later Chief Justice Taft's, opinion in the

13

Addison Pipe case, is:

14

necessary to achieve the efficiency-enhancing purposes

15

of the joint venture and is it no broader than

16

necessary?

Is that restraint reasonably

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

MR. NAGER:

It seems --

And if it is, then we would

19

analyze that restraint by reference not only to its

20

own pro-competitive benefits and anticompetitive

21

effects; we would analyze it by reference to the

22

benefits of the joint venture as a whole.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

Counsel, it seems to

24

me -- your last few answers seem to me to beg the

25

question.

You start out by saying, well, obviously

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it's a horizontal agreement among the teams, and then

2

you explain how you are going to analyze it.
I thought that was the very question before

3
4

us:

Whether these sorts of rules and regulations are

5

horizontal agreements between the teams or whether

6

they are part of a particular -- a single entity’s

7

articulation of rules.

8

MR. NAGER:

9

exactly right, and the real --

10

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, you are

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

begging the question?

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. NAGER:

That you have been

Is that -- that part?

Well, let me try to address

14

Justice Sotomayor's subsequent question in the context

15

of the way you are posing the question,

16

Mr. Chief Justice.

17

The reason it's a horizontal restraint is

18

because these -- under the Court's doctrine,

19

consistent teachings, whether it be Sealy, BMI,

20

Copperweld, these teams are separately owned.

21

separate decision-makers joining together, and they’re

22

making a decision about how they are going to jointly

23

produce something or not produce something.

24

that's what makes it concerted activity under this

25

Court's consistent teachings.

They’re

And

The distinction between

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

unilateral activity under section 1 and concerted

2

activity under section 1 has consistently been the

3

distinction between ownership integration of assets --

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

5

MR. NAGER:

6

Can I --

-- and contract integration of

assets.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Can I interrupt with this

8

question?

9

argue there are multiple actors, but also that their

10

Is it not part of your burden not only to

agreement has an adverse effect on competition?
MR. NAGER:

11

It -- absolutely, as the

12

plaintiff in the case, Justice Stevens, that we do.

13

That is not the ground of decision of the court below.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

14

I understand it isn't, but

15

it is part of your burden to say that this is not a

16

pro-competitive agreement.

17

MR. NAGER:

Absolutely.

I

Well, you at least have to

Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If -- if we find for you

2

and it goes back, then you would -- you would bear

3

that burden.

4

MR. NAGER:

That's correct.

And, in fact,

5

in this case, Justice Stevens, I would point out that

6

the NFL initially moved to dismiss the -- the rule of

7

reason count on the ground that it didn't state a

8

cognizable, plausible rule of reason claim, and the

9

district court judge denied that motion.

10

He found that the complaint alleged a market

11

in which he could not say, as a matter of law, that

12

the NFL defendants did not have market power, and he

13

recognized that the -- that the teams had agreed

14

together to prohibit competition in an aspect of their

15

licensing activity and in an aspect of their

16

merchandising activity.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

How does it work?
But what if he -- what if

19

he further concluded that the agreement had the

20

overall effect of stimulating additional -- it was

21

pro-competitive in that it would equalize the economic

22

strength of the teams and, therefore, made them all

23

better competitors on the playing field?

24

have been a defense?

25

MR. NAGER:

Would that

I'm sorry, Justice Stevens, I'm

14
Alderson Reporting Company

not quite sure.

I thought you were saying if in the

2

response to a motion to dismiss --

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

4

MR. NAGER:

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Right.

-- he had -- had held -He said:

Sure, there’s an

6

agreement here, but the burden is on the plaintiff to

7

show that the agreement has an adverse effect on

8

competition.

9

facts, you've -- there’s revenue sharing here, isn't

And that the -- as I understand the

10

there?

That they -- they all share in the product of

11

the sales of the joint product?

12

MR. NAGER:

Well, let me explain what

13

they've done, and I will then explain why it does have

14

a -- identifiable anticompetitive effects, which

15

certainly satisfy the pleading standards for a rule of

16

reason claim.

17

What the teams did here was they got

18

together and they agreed that they would not

19

themselves individually license their trademarks or

20

logos.

21

market system included the issuance of multiple

22

blanket licenses.

23

those blanket licenses from the market, and they would

24

give it in the exclusive control of Reebok, and they

25

would limit the circumstances in which they competed

in the markets.

I get the point.

5

I'm asking a question.

And I just heard you say that

The Red Sox.

All right.

You want the Red Sox to

compete in selling T-shirts with the Yankees; is that

right?

MR. NAGER:

I understand the -- the point.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

But you’re going to go back

3

and prove that actually there is competition between

4

5

MR. NAGER:
are making.

7
8

Well, I understand the point you

I would also make the point that --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is that what this case is

about?

9

MR. NAGER:

In part.

But you've got to

10

recognize what the competition is for.

11

competition is for fans.

12

is you're right that someone who has lived in New York

13

City for a long time is unlikely to be a Red Sox fan

14

and easily be persuaded to be a Red Sox fan, but the

15

person who is 3 years old can easily be persuaded.

allowances, the 3-year-olds.

18

19

right, but that's what you’re going to have to try --

MR. NAGER:

1

is --

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

4

-- that's just showing that each

team has substantial market power.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

Mr. NAGER:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

And again, they -But I'm trying to look --

8

what I'm trying to get in my mind is what specific

9

restraint you are focusing on.

10

You listed three or four, and one of them is

11

you want, in effect -- I'm joking about it, but it's

12

true -- you are arguing that the Yankees should

13

compete with the Red Sox in selling shirts.

14

Another thing you are complaining about,

15

which is the one I understand less, is that these

16

teams got together and they agreed that they would

17

just have one person sell all this stuff together.

18

And what you think is that they individually should

19

have decided whether to choose that one person, or

20

maybe to choose two people, or three.

you, Justice Kennedy, is that as Justice Scalia says,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Nager, I think you

2

answered my question originally:

3

Because they are separate entities, they agree on

4

everything.

5

there’s nothing that you would take outside, and you

6

put everything under the rule of reason analysis.

7

Yes, everything.

There’s agreement in every case.

MR. NAGER:

That -- that is correct.

So

But

8

that doesn't mean that the rule of reason is some

9

unstructured, indeterminate --

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

One -- one concern in the

11

litigation is, you know, if it doesn't come under the

12

Sherman Act at all, they go home after the case is

13

dismissed on the -- on the pleadings.
But once you say no, it's got to be a rule

14
15

of reason analysis, then you have discovery, which can

16

be costly.

discovery, and the court said:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, could you

6

articulate for me as succinctly as possible the extent

7

to which your position departs from the position of

8

the Solicitor General?

9

MR. NAGER:

The Solicitor General's position

10

is correct insofar as it criticizes the Seventh

11

Circuit's reasoning.

12

The test that the Solicitor General proposes

13

is conceptually and doctrinally unsound, and it will

14

create a lack of clarity where there presently exists

15

clarity in the cases, and it will produce inefficiency

16

and waste in the conduct of litigation that does not

17

presently exist.

18

And I could give --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I would have

19

thought it’s just the transfer of the inefficiency and

20

lack of clarity from the -- the first question to the

21

rule of reason.

22

don't have the same problem.

23

where you want to rest the inefficiency and confusion.

24
25

I mean, I'm not quite sure it -- you

MR. NAGER:
Mr. Chief Justice:

It's just a question of

Well, I understand your point,
That to the extent that rule of

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

reason inquiries are not as refined as they need to

2

be, since the Solicitor General's concerted conduct

3

inquiry includes rule of reason inquiries -- indeed,

4

on its effective merger standard, it says it has to

5

survive a rule of reason analysis or somehow be

6

waived, or you would have to do it as part of the

7

concerted conduct inquiry, so that there is no doubt

8

to the extent that -- that the rule of reason is a

9

continuing project of this Court, we would be

10

transferring some of that project into the concerted

11

conduct inquiry.

12

With all respect, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't

13

think that would be a healthy development in the law.

14

The courts actually understand the concerted conduct

15

doctrine as it presently exists.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I -- I thought

17

the purpose of their submission was to respond to some

18

of the questions we've seen, like scheduling, like

There are some things that it just seems odd to

subject to a rule of reason analysis.

3

to address the issue that you are actually trying to

4

address, rather than call it something else.

5

Right now, we have an antitrust doctrine

that says you've got to have concerted conduct and you

7

have to have an unreasonable restraint of trade.

8

have courts that understand how to apply this Court's

9

cases on concerted conduct.

We

This Court, for

10

understandable reasons, is sensitive to the fact that

11

the rule of reason is not quite as well understood and

12

is an evolutionary doctrine, perfectly well understood

13

by me.

14

There are certain issues this Court has

15

said come up in a rule of reason analysis and, to

16

quote the Court from Cal. Dental, "can be dealt with

17

in the twinkling of an eye"; that is, some claims, as

18

the NCAA Court said, are not going to be serious rule

19

of reason claims and can be dismissed on the

20

pleadings.

21

The Court said that in Twombly as well.

position, that could be the result in this case.

MR. NAGER:

In terms of what this Court --

2

obviously, on my client's behalf, I have to vigorously

state to the Court we think we have a bona fide,

4

serious rule of reason claim -- but, yes, Justice

5

Stevens --

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And one thing I wondered

7

about the record:

There is discussion in the briefs

8

about the fact that the teams share the revenues from

9

these -- these sales.

Is that -- how did that get in

10

the record, the revenue sharing aspect of their -- of

11

the different teams' participation?
MR. NAGER:

12

Well, I -- I didn't handle the

13

case below, so I don't quite know how it got into the

14

record.

15

there is an affidavit in the record that says that the

16

revenues that the NFLP entity receives are distributed

17

to the teams in equal shares, so that that --

18

It is my -- certainly my understanding that

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Would -- wouldn't that --

19

that affidavit support the conclusion that this is

20

basically a pro-competitive agreement because it tends

21

to make competition stronger on the playing field,

22

and, therefore, that's a sufficient defense under the

23

rule of reason, and that's the end of the ball game?

24
25

MR. NAGER:

I -- I think not.

You have to

remember that that agreement to not compete and have

only one entity -JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but you are not just

competing -MR. NAGER:

That’s the very thing the case

challenges.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

But with regard to sales

7

of the paraphernalia and so forth that you have here,

8

you’re not just competing among the members of the

9

league; you’re competing in a market that includes all

10
11

sports paraphernalia.
MR. NAGER:

No, our market was alleged and

12

held not to be legally invalid by the district court,

13

to be NFL-logoed hats and apparel.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That assumes there is no

15

competition between the sales of those logos and the

16

sales of other sports logos.

17

MR. NAGER:

Well, that -- that's correct.

18

And the district court judge held that that was a --

19

based upon this Court's decision in NCAA and the

20

International Boxing case, was a plausible market to

21

allege in which the NFL teams had market power.

22

so it would be a question for the district court

23

managing the case going forward to determine whether

24

or not that was a factually supportable market.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

14

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

15

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY

16
17

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

18

I think that by focusing on a rather mundane

19

aspect of the NFL commissioner's powers, this may help

20

to explain why the United States is not four-square in

21

support of either party's theory in this case.

22

the powers that is vested in the commissioner by the

23

NFL -- by the NFL constitution is the power to incur

24

expenses to carry on the ordinary business of the

25

league, and this includes renting office space, hiring

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Among

Official

1

employees, and procuring supplies.

2

And if the commissioner, pursuant to that

3

delegation of authority, decides from which company

4

he's going to -- to acquire paper for the league's

5

offices or decides what the wage scale for secretaries

6

in the league offices should be, our view is that

7

that's the conduct of a single entity.

8

the commissioner's power to do those things is

9

ultimately derived from the consent of the individual

It may be that

10

teams within the league, but once that consent has

11

been given, once that authority has been centralized,

12

then the commissioner's decision about a paper

point.

Is it better

Or just say, look, it's a joint

If Panagra creates a joint venture, of

23

course they are going to buy things like office space

24

and employees, so it's reasonable by definition.

25

don't even look into it.

We

Those things that are close

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

enough -- take your criteria from 17, page 17, which

2

are excellent criteria in my mind, and you say these

3

are the criteria by which we decide whether those

4

ancillary parts of a joint venture that is itself

5

reasonable are also reasonable.

6

MR. STEWART:

I guess we would say two

7

things:

8

such thing in the law as concerted action that is per

9

se legal or per se reasonable.

10

The first is, up to now there has been no

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no.

We wouldn't say

11

per se.

12

They are reasonable.

13

Because there is a legitimate joint venture, and this

14

is an ancillary part of that legitimate joint venture.

15

We are saying that the justification here:
Why are they reasonable?

People can attack it, but it's going to be

16

no easier to attack than if they tried to attack what

17

you call a single entity.

18

MR. STEWART:

I guess my point is that if,

19

for instance, a disappointed bidder for the paper

20

supply conduct -- contract challenged this as a

21

section 1 violation and said the commissioner's

22

decision to go to Staples rather than Office Depot was

23

unreasonable --

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

MR. STEWART:

I see.

-- because Office Depot was

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

offering a better product at a lower price -- that

2

there are certainly decisions that the commissioner

3

could make with respect to procurement of supplies or

4

the setting of wage levels that would be unreasonable

5

in a business judgment sense, in that they wouldn't

6

effectively carry on the mission of the organization,

7

but they wouldn't be unreasonable in the -- the

8

section 1 sense.

9

And the other thing I would say is that line

10

of argument could have been made in Copperweld; that

11

is, the Court could have concluded that --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Copperweld -- look, your

13

second criteria opens it up to attack in precisely the

14

same way that my use of rule of reason does, because

15

they are going to have to show it doesn't

16

significantly affect actual or potential competition.

17

Therefore, they file their claim; they say they win

18

under the second criteria.

19

as a person filing his claim and saying it's

20

unreasonable.

That’s precisely the same

21

We are only talking terminology, but what

22

worries me about this is the terminology, because I

23

think that the lower courts have taken Copperweld

24

terminology and transferred it to a place where it

25

does, I think, perhaps not belong.

MR. STEWART:

Well -- well, in Dagher, for

2

instance, the Court was dealing with a situation

3

that's in some ways analogous to the one that you have

4

here; that is, a joint venture in which entities that

5

were economic competitors in some aspects of their

6

businesses joined forces with respect to other

7

aspects.

8

resolve these questions, whether section 1 applied,

9

but it said that in pricing its products, Equilon, the

And the Court in Dagher didn't squarely

10

joint venture, was acting as a single firm, a single

11

entity.

12

The other point I would like to make

13

about my -- my paper and employee example is that, in

14

our view, the NFL commissioner, when carrying out

15

those functions on behalf of the league, would be

16

acting as a single entity, even though his power was

17

derived from the consent of the teams. But if the Jets

18

and the Giants agreed among themselves as to what

19

wages they would pay their secretaries or from whom

20

they would buy paper, that would be an entirely

21

different thing.

22

some purposes part of a --

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The fact that those teams are for

May I ask you this

24

question, Mr. Stewart?

Would the antitrust issue

25

before us be any different if instead of giving an

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

exclusive contract to one purveyor of the product, the

2

commissioner had entered into a multitude of different

3

contracts, but specified a minimum price in every one

4

he specified?

5

MR. STEWART:

I think the section -- the

6

question of whether section 1 applied would not be any

7

different; that is, the central section 1 that --

8

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So the fact that this is

an exclusive agreement is kind of a red herring in
this case, isn't it?
MR. STEWART:

11

It -- it may not be a red

12

herring with respect to the ultimate resolution of the

13

case; that is, if the court on -- the lower court, on

14

remand, if the case were remanded, applied rule of

15

reason analysis, the -- the precise nature of the

16

contract might bear on whether the restraint was

17

reasonable, but it wouldn't bear on the question of

18

whether concerted activity was involved; that is,

19

what -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21
22

I don't -- I'm

I didn't mean to interrupt your answer.
MR. STEWART:

I guess my point was, once --

23

once the teams decided that they would -- rather than

24

each negotiating individually, either with a single

25

licensee or with multiple licensees, once they decided

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

they would negotiate as a collective and that any

2

potential licensee had to go to the collective rather

3

than to the individual teams, that's the central

4

section 1 issue.

5

decided, we will give contracts to a multitude of

6

potential bidders, that would not have affected the

7

fact that concerted action was involved.

And if the -- the collective had

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So under your --

following of your paper case, are you saying that if

10

the teams delegated to the commissioner the authority

11

to decide whether we are going to enter -- whether the

12

league is going to enter into one contract on logo

13

products or let each team decide, that would be all

14

right?
MR. STEWART:

15

That would -- that initial

16

delegation of authority would be subject to a

17

section 1 challenge, because that would be concerted

18

action in the same way that the Court in Dagher

19

said --

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, why isn't the

21

decision to order paper from one company rather than

22

another subject to section 1 challenge?

23

MR. STEWART:

Because that -- that occurs

24

after the point at which the commissioner has been

25

vested with that authority.

35
Alderson Reporting Company

1

If somehow a plaintiff wanted to say there

2

was an -- there was illicit concerted action when the

3

power, that would be subject to section 1 review.

seems -- because that would be concerted action.

out the ordinary business of the league.

14

would only apply to the commissioner's running of --

of the league office, not the running of the

analysis?

So, what are the questions you

36
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. STEWART:

I guess under our theory, we

would first ask, as to an entity like this, which is

entities that compete in some respects with --

5

into this case.

6

commissioner.

7

Let's -- let’s not go

Let's -- let's stay with your single

MR. STEWART:

I think we would ask first:

8

Is -- is the commissioner acting as a single entity

9

when he exercises delegated authority in making a

10

business judgment about which supplier to buy paper or

11

what the wages should be?

12

If the answer is yes, then the section 1

13

inquiry is over, then the case is no different from a

14

challenge to the --

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, how does that stop

16

any group of competitors from coming in and saying:

17

Gee, I want to sell my gas; I'm going to let this

18

single commissioner decide how much my gas will sell

19

for, and if he chooses to sell it at the same price to

20

everybody, both gas products, that's okay.

21

get to that?

22

MR. STEWART:

How do you

Well, I think if a single

23

business is deciding whether to buy paper from one

24

supplier or from several, that wouldn't be subject to

25

section 1 review, because the decision of the single

37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

business might affect the welfare of the competitors,

2

but it wouldn't be concerted action.
And our point is that when -- I think the

3
4

way in which our position differs from that of the two

5

parties is that on the one hand, I think it is the

6

logical implication of Petitioner's position that

7

because the commissioner's authority to buy supplies

8

for the league or hire referees for the league is

9

ultimately derived from the consent of the individual

10

teams who are independently owned, the logic of

11

Petitioner's position suggests that that would be

12

subject to section 1 scrutiny.

13

On the other hand, the logic of the NFL's

14

position suggests that because the commissioner can

15

8

Properties was formed, there was venture formation at

9

that point.

10

That's why I

At that point, what was the question?

The

11

question was:

How should the league, how should the

12

venture members, best promote the venture product?

13

And the decision was made to use the licenses of their

14

intellectual property as a promotional tool.
On that issue, the discovery and the record

15
16

below was undisputed.

17

from the NFL Properties' articles of incorporation.

18

There’s testimony from an NFL executive, Mr. Herzog.

19

And the best proof, if there were any question about

20

that, is reflected in the -- the organic documents of

21

NFL Properties, which at the outset said that, if

22

there were any revenues from the licensing activities,

23

they would be donated to charitable and educational

24

causes.

25

There is documentary evidence

Now, you know, Dagher confirmed the general

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

principle, but if the venture is lawfully formed, the

2

venture's decisions about how best to produce and

3

promote its product are venture decisions, not the

4

decisions of the venture members.

5

But Copperweld provides the framework that

6

decides the issue here, and neither Mr. Stewart nor

7

Mr. Nager mention Copperweld, except in passing.

8

Copperweld is the case by which this Court turned the

9

page, if you will, on the formalism of prior cases,

10

including Sealy, which Mr. Nager -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

May -- may I ask you to

12

established a standard that said that what section 1

What decision could the

permissible range of the joint venture activities?

seems to me that if the venture wanted to make sure

all the teams hired secretaries at the same

okay, because it's a joint venture.

8

Are you basing that on economic-related data about the

pros and the cons of -- you know, the economic harms

of stopping them from competing versus the economic

benefits of allowing them to act as a separate -- as a

And what worried -- I thought when I read

15

the opinion, first, of the district court, that he's

16

just following what I think started in the Seventh

17

Circuit, unfortunately, of taking this word "single

18

entity" and throwing around -- throwing it around all

19

over the place and stopping the economic analysis.

20

But then when I read the last paragraphs of

21

his opinion, he seems to be saying, when I go back to

22

the record, which you want me to do, I will discover

23

that there is lots of information showing economic

24

benefit to this venture of promoting together.

25

There's nothing to suggest they could compete, and so

That's not this case.
Well, I wouldn't read --

52

Copperweld is

competing with each other in price.
A joint venture is a situation where it's

debatable whether or not there is that kind of

But that's not the case here.

JUSTICE BREYER:

There is very definitely a

joint venture to build houses, and there isn't a joint

venture obviously in sight to promote.

53
Alderson Reporting Company

1

So they’re saying that there’s such a

2

different activity, the playing of football versus the

3

promotion of a logo, that we ought to go and look

4

under a rule of reason as to whether a joint venture

5

in promoting a logo is justified in terms of

6

competition's harms and economic benefits.

7

MR. LEVY:

Justice Breyer, I agree with you

8

that there is a difference, an important difference,

9

between venture and nonventure activity.

If the NFL

10

clubs were to create a trucking company or, in your

11

example, would go off and build houses, that's not a

12

venture activity.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, it would be if they

14

tried to do it, but, there, they would be attacked on

15

the ground that under the rule of reason, they do not

16

have the justification such that the antitrust law

17

would allow them to do it.

those judgments cabined or inhibited or chilled by --

10

But, here, Judge Moran did what we thought was the --

11

and we continue to think is the most appropriate way

12

to serve the interests of both the Sherman Act and the

13

considerations that this Court has recognized in

14

Twombly and other cases, and that’s to provide an

15

early opportunity for a determination of whether or

16

not the venture -- the venture conduct, the venture

decision that is at issue, is a venture decision of a

18

single entity or whether it is a collective decision

label it “single entity,” as opposed to label it what

7

8

MR. LEVY:

The answer, Your Honor, is

inherent in the rule of reason.

In the modern era,

10

defending a claim like this on the merits involves an

11

investment of tens of millions of dollars, thousands

12

of hours of executive time, hours and hours of court

13

time.

Is this the kind of thing that should be

So, how do I save you the $7 million?

We were able to resolve this case on

62

of reason discovery, and your reference to the

Patriots tractor store drives home a distinction that

3

I think is worth leaving with the Court at this point.

4

This is not a situation, like the situation

5

to which we adverted in our brief, where John Deere

MR. LEVY:

You know, I -- I can bring the

15

basic point that I -- I want to leave you with back to

16

our example that's a little bit closer to home.

17

In 1999 -- 1919, when Judge Covington and

18

Mr. Burling went to join forces, they formed a law

19

firm, a venture.

20

decides on the prices, the rates that Mr. Ludwin and I

21

will -- will decide for our -- will charge for our

22

services.

23

24

that we’ll limit our business to a particular client

25

in a particular industry.

Ninety years later, that venture

Nobody suggests that that decision of the

scrutiny as a violation of the Sherman Act,

4

constitutes a concerted refusal to deal.

5

But if Mr. Ludwin and I leave the -- leave

6

the firm and we set up solo practices and then decide

7

on what our rates are going to be or then decide on

8

what our -- what clients we will serve and not serve,

that is an agreement between independent competitors.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GLEN D. NAGER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

22

MR. NAGER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

23

I'd just like to pick up on a question that

24

Chief Justice Roberts asked me with a point that

25

Justice Breyer made, which is that both the Solicitor

65
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

General's position and the NFL's position are taking

2

rule of reason concepts and trying to push them into

3

the concerted conduct inquiry, which will have the

4

effect, of course, of confusing courts that presently

5

understand the inquiry.

6

about terminology.

7

That's Justice Breyer's point

It also has substantive impact because of

8

the way litigation gets conducted.

As Mr. Levy has

9

said, this case was litigated below at the district

10

court judge's direction only on the concerted conduct

11

question, not on the -- the rule of reason questions.

12

So, American Needle didn't have the opportunity to

13

conduct discovery and make proof about anticompetitive

14

effects and to try to rebut the arguments that the NFL

15

was making about pro-competitive justifications.
The NFL's argument is asking -- they are

16
17

asking for a per se rule of legality for everything

18

that the NFL does that is related to football.

19

21

the -- what's the answer to the hypothetical Mr. Levy

22

ended with, the law firm?
MR. NAGER:

23
24
25

example?

On the -- the partnership

Well, the partnership is -- is as follows:
As -- as to the extent that there’s case law

66
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

on the subject, as with all joint ventures, the case

2

law treats law firm partnerships as joint ventures and

3

subjects them to the rule of reason, and every

4

commentator, whether it be Judge Bork or anyone else,

5

has said:

power so they couldn't possibly have anticompetitive

7

effects on the market, and a rule of reason claim

its partnership rates wouldn't pass -- survive a

motion to dismiss.
With respect to his analogy to Dagher, the

12

difference between the Dagher effects -- of course

13

this Court in Dagher didn't accept the argument that

14

I made on behalf of Texaco and Shell that they should

15

be treated as a single entity if, in fact, their

16

formation was lawful.

17

on the price-fixing issue.

18

This Court only ruled on the -­

But the argument that was made in Dagher was

19

if you had a wholly integrated joint venture, one in

20

which there had been a complete pooling of relevant

21

capital, a complete sharing of profits and losses, and

22

an enforceable non-compete agreement, in those

23

circumstances the -- the owners of that joint venture

24

were not like typical joint venturers; they, in fact,

25

were like the shareholders in a publicly held company
