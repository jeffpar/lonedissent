CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We’ll hear argument

first this morning in Case 08-1402, Berghuis v. Smith.

5

Mr. Restuccia.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF B. ERIC RESTUCCIA

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. RESTUCCIA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

10

This is really a case about the law of

11

habeas corpus for this murder conviction that was

12

obtained in the Michigan courts.

13

The issue was whether the Michigan Supreme

14

Court unreasonably applied clearly established Supreme

15

Court precedent in rejecting Mr. Smith's claim that

16

his jury was not drawn from a fair cross-section of

17

the community.

18

The Michigan Supreme Court did not act

19

unreasonably in concluding that there was no

20

unconstitutional underrepresentation and that there

21

was no systematic exclusion.

22

Duren did not require a different result on either

23

point, and this Court should reverse the Sixth

24

Circuit.

25

This Court's decision in

I think it's important to note that there
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

are two prongs at issue:

The fair and reasonable

2

representation prong and the systematic exclusion

3

prong.

4

the disparities at issue here are relatively small,

5

that the time period at issue runs from -- from April

6

of 1993 to October of 1993, where there was

7

information -- for those 6 months for which the

8

processes at play were measured.

And it’s also significant to understand that

9

And the percentage of African-Americans that

10

appeared in the venires during that time period was --

11

they comprised 6 percent of the venires, where the

12

jury-eligible population was 7.28 percent.

13

so there was a 1.28 percent absolute disparity during

14

this 6-month time period.

15

as an 18 percent comparative disparity.

16

So your --

That can also be measured

Now, if you compare that to the disparities

17

that are issue -- at issue in Duren, they really are a

18

magnitude of difference, that the disparities in Duren

19

involve the exclusion of women in Missouri, where they

20

comprised -- women comprised 54 percent of the

21

population and only 14.5 percent of the venires over

22

an 8-month period of time.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

The -- I don't know if this

24

is relevant or how to use it, but years ago, I took a

25

course in this kind of thing at the Kennedy School.
4
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official

1

was teaching, and they said the only way you could

2

figure out what -- what's what here is you use

3

something called “binomial theorem,” and you have to

4

have, like, urns, and you imagine that there’s an urn

5

with 1,000 balls, and 60 of them are red, and 940 are

6

black, and then you select them at random, and -- and

7

12 at a time.

8

with 12 in each.

9

You know, fill 12 -- fill a hundred

And when we tried to do that, just for the

10

interest of it, I -- I found that you would expect,

11

with these numbers, something like a third to a half

12

of juries would have at least one black person on it.

13

Now, that may be wrong, because I am not a

14

mathematician, but -- but putting that together, it

15

looks as if there is a pretty big disparity.

16

MR. RESTUCCIA:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well -On the other hand, that

18

isn't what they testified to, so I guess you’re going

19

to tell me just ignore it and forget it.

20

MR. RESTUCCIA:

Well, if you’re looking at

21

the Michigan Supreme Court decision, I think it's

22

important to note that it's not just that it would

23

have to be incorrect; it would have to be objectively

24

unreasonable under the AEDPA standard, that what’s at

25

issue here is did the Michigan Supreme Court
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

unreasonably apply --

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, you know, maybe it’s

3

the only way to do it, that the statistician stays

4

with these urns, which I guess they have computer

5

programs for.

6

MR. RESTUCCIA:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well -I -- I don't know, in other

8

words, and maybe I should just -- I hate to write

9

something, like, saying 2 and 2 is 6.

10
11

JUSTICE SCALIA:
here.

12

(Laughter.)

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

you want.

15
16

But we don't have any urns

No.

You can skip it, if

If there's any comment, fine.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think your point was

that Duren was quite different in the numbers --

17

MR. RESTUCCIA:

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.
-- starting out with

19

women 54 percent of the population, and then dwindled

20

to 14.5 percent of the -- of the jurors, available

21

jurors.

22

MR. RESTUCCIA:

Yes, Your Honor.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I guess the point

24

is, just following up, it's not that you’re going to

25

say 2 plus 2 is 6.

I suppose, under AEDPA, all you
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

have to do is say 2 plus 2 is somewhere between 3 and

2

5, right?

3

MR. RESTUCCIA:

Right.

That it’s not

4

unreasonable, and I think the best evidence of the

5

fact that this decision was not unreasonable is I --

6

in the blue brief, I put together a table of what the

7

other circuits have done with comparable statistical

8

disparities.

9

And it runs -- from the First Circuit

10

through the Tenth Circuit, I have seven circuits'

11

worth of opinions, and of course, there really are

12

additional cases, if you examine this.

13

look at the kinds of disparities that have been

14

examined by other courts on --

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And if you

May I interrupt with this

16

question that goes both to what Justice Ginsburg asked

17

and the other?

18

depending -- say it's -- the disparity between a

19

jurisdiction which has only 3 or 4 percent of a

20

minority should be treated similarly to a jurisdiction

21

where they have 30 or 40 percent?

22

Should we treat all areas the same,

MR. RESTUCCIA:

Well, the -- in my view,

23

this Court really didn't provide guidance in Duren

24

about how this should be measured.

25

doesn't specify what kind of measurement tools should
7
Alderson Reporting Company

In fact, Duren

Official

1
2

be used for examining disparity.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

But isn't it perfectly

3

obvious that you’re going to have dramatic differences

4

where you only have a very small percentage, as in --

5

in Grand Rapids, for example, and where you have a

6

major percentage as you did in Duren.

7

MR. RESTUCCIA:

Well, I think that's right.

8

And that's one of the reasons that on direct review

9

the courts are virtually unanimous in rejecting these

10

kinds of small disparities.

11

table on pages 32 and 33, the circuits, on direct

12

review, that were most comparable were the Second

13

Circuit decision in which the percentage of the

14

distinct group in the community was 7.08 percent and

15

in the jury pool it was 5.0 percent --

16

So if you look at the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but I suppose the

17

thrust of Justice Stevens's question was that if you

18

have a very small population that we are concerned

19

with, then the disparity can be very substantial,

20

especially if you use the comparative disparity.

21

MR. RESTUCCIA:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

23
24
25

That's right.

At the --

And I think -- at least, I

was interested in that aspect of his question.
MR. RESTUCCIA:

Well, as kind of the first

matter, it seems like this Court doesn't have to
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

really reach that hard question, insofar as the

2

Michigan Supreme Court's decision is entitled to

3

deference under AEDPA, meaning --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
hour.

6

Yes, but we have a half­

I’d kind of like to know how to -MR. RESTUCCIA:

Okay.

No, I understand.

7

understand.

8

first point.

9

me that the absolute disparity test is the better

I

I just want to make that as kind of a
Now, for the second point, it seems to

10

measure for examining -- examining these questions.

11

And the reason for that is that it objectively

12

captures the number of missing jurors that are part of

13

the venire, whereas the --

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

is 10 percent.

16

here?

But you -- but your test

And if you have a minority, what is it

7 point -- whatever it is.

17

MR. RESTUCCIA:

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7 --

7.28.
It's under 10 percent.

19

That would mean that a district is free to just

20

disregard all the people who are under 10 percent of

21

the population.

22

MR. RESTUCCIA:

The 10 percent test is not

23

really necessarily tied to the absolute disparity.

24

other words, this Court could conclude that the

25

absolute disparity test is the better test without
9
Alderson Reporting Company

In

Official

1

using that 10 percent threshold.

2

the 10 percent threshold is that's really what's

3

happening on the ground in the Federal courts.

4

very hard to find a case in which there’s a --

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The reason I suggest

It's

You would suggest that

6

in a population that has 9 percent of any group,

7

protected group, that if they didn't have one person

8

serve on a jury per year of that group, that that

9

would not -- under an absolute disparity test using

10

the 10 percent figure, that would not give rise to any

11

kind of suspicion?

12

MR. RESTUCCIA:

13

this Court adopted it --

14
15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. RESTUCCIA:

It would not meet the

That's right.

If the Court

--

18
19

Under -- if

Duren's second prong.

16
17

That's right.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Does that make any sense

to you?

20

MR. RESTUCCIA:

It reflects the actual

21

practice of the courts because of the -- if you look

22

at the --

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I don't think that

24

-- that any court has suggested that the complete

25

absence of the protected group in that kind of number
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

wouldn't give rise to a fair representation claim.

2

That's why this Court, the Michigan court, and many

3

others have said that the absolute disparity test just

4

can't be used in every circumstance.

5

MR. RESTUCCIA:

Well, the -- it seems --

6

looking at what the Federal courts have done, they’ve

7

all -- they’ve generally used multiple tests.

8

there are several circuits that have relied on this 10

9

percent threshold, but it's not necessary for the

Now,

10

State to prevail in order for this Court to adopt the

11

10 percent threshold.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't.

The question I

13

have you for you is -- that's what you have been

14

advocating, or at least your brief suggested we

15

should.

16

the hands of the courts to sort of figure out what

17

test is better under what circumstances than us

18

announce a flat rule that would lead to a result like

19

the example that I just used?

20

Wouldn't it be better for to us leave this in

MR. RESTUCCIA:

I -- I understand that

21

point.

The reason that I'm suggesting a threshold

22

also is it corresponds to a practical aspect of the

23

application of these rules.

24

sufficiently small absolute disparity, as a matter of

25

probability, it’s not likely to affect the actual

The -- if you have a

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

composition of the petit jury.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I agree that if a

3

protected group is 1 percent of the population, that

4

it’s not likely that their absence is going to give

5

rise to any flags.

6

MR. RESTUCCIA:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

difference.

I don’t

9

statistically where.

Right.
But I think there is a

-- I just don't know
And we have to leave this in the

10

judgment of the lower courts as to where between 1 and

11

9 or 1 and 10 a difference makes sense.

12

what the courts are saying, is:

13

to determine that.

14

MR. RESTUCCIA:

And that's

We can't use one test

Well -- and one of the

15

concerns I have is I -- for example, I know in Kent

16

County that if you look at the other distinct groups ­

17

- you look at the 1990 census for Kent County, it was

18

comprised of 2 point -- 2.9 percent Latino-Americans,

19

1.1 percent Asian-Americans, and 0.6 percent Native

20

Americans.

21

Now, if you look at the one month that's

22

been placed at issue, in which Mr. Smith is indicating

23

that there was a 35 percent comparative disparity for

24

that one month, if that becomes the threshold, the

25

standard used, which the Sixth Circuit concluded was ­
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

- established a violation of the second prong, then if

2

you think about the practical application that -- for

3

Michigan, for Kent County, if you take your 158 jurors

4

in that jury pool, you’d expect for that one month for

5

there to be four or five Latino-Americans, two Asian-

6

Americans, and one Native American.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. RESTUCCIA:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

What's wrong -What’s missing -- I’m sorry.
Yes.

What's wrong with a

rule?

11

MR. RESTUCCIA:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What's wrong with what?
With a rule?

With picking

13

a number, rather than leaving it up to the courts of

14

appeals or the district courts to use different

15

numbers, different times?

16

of these cases all the time.

17

number?

I don't have to review all
Why don't we pick a

You want 10, right?

18

MR. RESTUCCIA:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

MR. RESTUCCIA:

That what was I -Yes -That has been the practice

21

of the courts below.

That's why I'm -- I'm advocating

22

it.

23

certain point, absolute disparity will have no

24

practical -- for example, in this case, the venire at

25

issue, according to the State trial court, included 60

But it does correspond to this idea that below a

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

prospective jurors, and there were three African-

2

Americans, which would then constitute 5 percent.

3

Now, in order for that percentage to

4

correspond exactly to the jury-eligible population,

5

there would had to have been one or two more African-

6

American jurors as part of that venire.

7

matter of probability, if you have 12 being selected

8

from 60 -- this is kind of your point, Justice Breyer

9

-- that it's not -- it's more likely than not that

Well, as a

10

would have no effect on the actual selection of the

11

petit jury --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't know.

The one

13

thing I learned from the urn business is it never

14

turns out the way you think.

15

(Laughter.)

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

For example, it had the

17

example of, like, the eight:

There are eight out of a

18

hundred, and you run this thing a thousand times, and

19

you’ll discover that there is one black juror on about

20

half the juries, or a third, anyway.

21

than I would have thought intuitively.

22

not have even read the example correctly.

23

why I -- I’m at sea, as soon as you tell me to be a

24

statistician.

25

for Lawyers.

That's much more
And I might
So you see

I even got a book called Statistician
That didn't help me very much.
14
Alderson Reporting Company

1

(Laughter.)

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

That's why Las Vegas makes

a profit, right?

4

(Laughter.)

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it does

6

depend, doesn't it, on the size of the -- the urn?

7

other words, if it's a smaller --

8

(Laughter.)

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In

If it's 10,000 of

10

these balls and you are going to go through it 10,000

11

times, it's more likely that you are going to get a

12

sample that reflects the overall percentage, correct?

13

MR. RESTUCCIA:

I think that's right.

One

14

of the -- one of the reasons, also -- talking about

15

this 10 percent as a rule -- is that if you look

16

through these cases, you’ll see a lot of -- a lot of

17

the courts, on direct review -- and I think -- I'm

18

going to come back to this point, that this, of

19

course, is an AEDPA case, so the question is whether

20

the Michigan Supreme Court acted unreasonably.

21

I think there’s a different standard, that it doesn't

22

have to have gotten it right; it had to have been

23

objectively unreasonable.

24
25

And so

But setting that aside, you’ll find many
cases in which there are disparities of 5 percent and
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

7 percent which have been rejected.

And the reason is

2

you have neutral processes, processes that everyone

3

would agree are reasonable on their face, which result

4

in disparities for distinct groups.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are you -- are you saying

6

that systematic exclusion -- and we are assuming good

7

faith, no intent to discriminate --

8

MR. RESTUCCIA:

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

MR. RESTUCCIA:

No.

I'm making just the --

the opposite point, that under the third --

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

MR. RESTUCCIA:

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

-- that systematic

exclusion is always proven or disproven by statistics?

11
12

Right.

Well -I’m sorry.
And I’ll -- I’ll allow you

to answer, of course, but --

17

MR. RESTUCCIA:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

systematic exclusion?

20

intent to discriminate.

If not, how do we show

22

categorical distinction, meaning women were exempted

exemption.

25

if you had just a disparate impact based on a neutral

Women had an automatic

This Court didn't delineate in Duren that

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

process, that that would be sufficient to give rise to

2

systematic exclusion.

3

the Federal courts have applied it on direct review,

4

that there --

5

And that's really been the way

JUSTICE ALITO:

The statistical issue is

6

very interesting, but I -- I wonder, if we were not

7

looking at this through AEDPA, why we -- why a court

8

should necessarily have to start with the question --

9

with the elements of the prima facie -- with the

10

question of whether there is unconstitutional

11

underrepresentation, when in the end, as I understand

12

Duren, the defendant has to identify some aspect of

13

the jury selection process that has a disproportionate

14

impact on the group involved and is unreasonable?

15

unless that can be done at the outset, why struggle

16

with these statistics?

And

17

Now, here, to illustrate, the aspect of the

18

jury selection process that the Sixth Circuit thought

19

was unreasonable was the prior practice of choosing

20

the jurors first for the district courts, the

21

misdemeanor courts, rather than the circuit courts,

22

the -- the felony courts.

23

it seemed to me, address this in -- in a very

24

thoughtful way, and he said there just isn't any proof

25

that this old system had that effect.

But the -- the trial judge,

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And it's hard for me to see how it could

2

have that effect, unless the -- the number of jurors

3

chosen for the district courts in Grand Rapids was

4

disproportionate to the number chosen for the district

5

courts in the other jurisdictions within the county.

6

So that seems to me to be the end of the case.

7

And why does it make sense to -- to struggle

8

with this rather complicated statistical problem, if

9

at the end of the day, it's going to come down to

10
11

something of that nature?
MR. RESTUCCIA:

I think that may be the

12

easiest way to resolve this case, because under the

13

third prong, the Michigan Supreme Court on the

14

question of jury assignment concluded that Mr. Smith

15

had failed to factually show that there was any

16

underrepresentation that arose from that process.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Didn't the Michigan

18

Supreme Court do essentially what Justice Alito

19

suggested, that they said:

20

of the doubt, go on to the third.

21

We’ll give you the benefit

But on that third, it seems to me there’s

22

nothing that shows us what was the representation in

23

the district before they made the change vis-à-vis the

24

circuit courts, was there?

25

MR. RESTUCCIA:

The -- the information that
18

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Mr. Smith's expert provided is he -- he had -- there

2

are two jury terms that were described, one for 6

3

months, in which this juror assignment to the local

4

courts first occurred, and then 1 year for the

5

following year, in which the jury assignment did not

6

send them to the local courts first.

7

different pools that are being compared.

So you have two

MR. RESTUCCIA:

No.

There’s -- there’s no

logical necessity that sending courts -- because you

6

understand that you have the entire county, and the

county is then broken up into districts?

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. RESTUCCIA:

10
11

Right.
And the districts are the

local courts, and they are misdemeanor courts.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

in the district court than in the -- in the felony

MR. RESTUCCIA:

It all depends on the local

courts and their usage of jurors.

would result in a larger number of African-Americans

7

being present on the circuit court.

that Grand Rapids must have needed proportionately

The -- the

up on non-returns, it may affect distinct groups

that issue has been that the decisions to exempt

The analysis of the Federal courts on

28

to an invitation for jury service is outside the

is -- can result in systematic exclusion, what's going

to happen is that all these neutral processes that

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
If the annual jury call of minorities at the

23

courthouse in Grand Rapids is down by 7.28 percent of

24

the total number of jurors called, that means if it

25

happens in Detroit, that means almost nothing, but if
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it happens in Grand Rapids, that's every minority.

2

The Petitioner's goal is to have this Court enshrine

3

into law a rule that the two situations are exactly

4

the same.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If you had a

6

community with one African-American, your argument

7

would be the same, if that's the disparity?

8

means every -- every minority is left off the jury.

9

MR. LAWRENCE:

That

Well, I think that certainly

10

if you adopt the Petitioner's test for 60 percent of

11

the country, Duren would not apply regarding African-

12

Americans; 90 percent of the country, wouldn't apply

13

to Hispanics; and Duren protections would never apply

14

to Native Americans anywhere.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I guess I'm -- I

16

guess I’m echoing Justice Stevens’s question of

17

whether or not this type of statistical analysis

18

really works when you’re dealing with relatively small

19

numbers.

20

MR. LAWRENCE:

Well, I would make this

21

observation:

That in Duren v. Missouri, on page 366,

22

the Court stated, "His undisputed demonstration that a

23

large discrepancy occurred, not just occasionally, but

24

in every weekly venire for a period of nearly a year,

25

manifestly indicates that the cause of the
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

representation was systematic -- that is, inherent in

2

the particular jury selection process utilized."

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but there you were

4

dealing with an express exemption.

There was an

5

exemption for a woman, and also in the record was that

6

the jury clerk was sending out notices saying:

7

if you do not wish to serve, return the summons to the

8

judge named on the reverse side as quickly as

9

possible.

Women,

And then, further -- systematic -- if the

10

card was not returned, if a card sent to a woman was

11

not returned, it was automatically assumed that she

12

did not wish to serve.

13

There was no follow-up.

So there was all kinds of evidence of

14

systematic problems in Duren that are not present

15

here.

16

MR. LAWRENCE:

Well, first of all, that's

17

completely correct; however, the rule in Duren, the

18

U.S. Supreme Court stated that the numbers alone prove

19

systematic.

20
21
22

Then the Court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Where did the Court say

that?
MR. LAWRENCE:

On page 366.

And then in --

23

the Court went on to say that the State is arguing

24

that there's various neutral, benign reasons for the

25

underrepresentation -33

MR. LAWRENCE:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought Duren

It did.
And the third one was that

7

you had to establish -- after having already

8

established the disparity, you had to establish that

9

there was a selection process which caused the

10

disparity.

11

to proceed to step 3.

12

is assumed that it is the product of the system.

13

And you are telling us that you don't have

MR. LAWRENCE:

Once you show the disparity, it

Well, Justice Scalia, my

14

reading of Duren does indeed include that third test,

15

but the problem is, is that Duren puts the burden of

16

proof on that test on the State.

17

368 to 369 that the State is claiming there were all

18

sorts of neutral, legitimate reasons for the

19

underrepresentation --

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They said at pages

Oh, that was after --

21

that was after showing the systematic factors.

It was

22

the plaintiff's burden -- or the defendant in the

23

case, Duren -- burden to show there was a systematic

24

factor.

25

and how it worked in practice.

That was the automatic exception for a woman
After all of that,

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

then Justice White tells us, the State could still

2

come back and say yes, that's true, but there were

3

other reasons why women didn't show up.

4

were disproportionately elderly, or maybe they were

5

involved with child care.

6

Maybe they

That's what -- that's what Duren said, that

7

the -- showing a systematic factor was the plaintiff's

8

burden, and then the State could justify why the

9

numbers came out that way.

10

MR. LAWRENCE:

Well, we did show a number of

11

systematic factors, but if you look at Duren itself,

12

on page 366 it says, the numbers alone proved it.

13

-- further on 366, they stated that Duren --

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

with the third test?

that statement with the fact that it did set forth a

three -- a three-prong test.

18

MR. LAWRENCE:

Well, I believe that we met

19

the three-prong test, but I feel that it is an error

20

in reading Duren to say anything other than that:

21

22

defendant.

to show that it has a reason, a good reason, for --

5

the aspect of the selection process that has been

identified as causing the disparity.

7

But does it say that it's the State's

obligation to go through every factor that may cause

the disparity and justify every one?

Or is it the

defendant's obligation to point to some aspect of the

selection -- of the -- of the system that causes the

disparity?

13

then the State can show if it -- can try to show that

there's a good reason for it.

Then once the defendant identifies that,

disproportionate number and it is not in the record

MR. LAWRENCE:

Well, I would respectfully

24

disagree with the Court because it is not necessary,

25

in our view, that each specific item that led to

underrepresentation be, itself, something that's

2

unconstitutional, but rather, the collective nature of

3

it, that 15 out of 17 months persistently and

4

repeatedly came up with substantial

5

underrepresentation.

6

percent here.

7

You are talking about 34.8

JUSTICE ALITO:

But that's the only factor

8

that the Sixth Circuit identified as illegitimate, was

9

this -- was this siphoning system.

10

MR. LAWRENCE:

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I feel that -It rejected everything else,

I suppose that we could do it on

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, why is it -- I’m just

18

not clear in my mind.

19

impression, which may be wrong, is you -- you have a

20

thousand people in the room, let's say, and if you let

21

the district courts choose first, people will serve

22

nearer where they live.

23

Why is this siphoning bad?

My

Now -- and so most of them would rather

24

serve nearer where they live.

And the result of that

25

could be, for the reasons that were stated, that then
38
Alderson Reporting Company

1

there are fewer minorities on the more general jurors

2

that draw from a wider area, and I don't know about

3

the merits of that.

4

I mean, I see a negative, and I see a

5

positive.

So is it -- it doesn't seem to me obviously

6

bad, nor is it obviously good.

7

MR. LAWRENCE:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

MR. LAWRENCE:

So what should I do?

Well, the record showed -Right.
-- that the people who were

10

actually showing up for the jury panels at circuit

11

court were very heavily overrepresented in the rural

12

areas of Kent County and heavily underrepresented --

13
14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, but -- but that's

just the explanation of the problem that we're seeing.

15

MR. LAWRENCE:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.

Well, I guess --

The problem we're seeing is

17

that if Grand Rapids has a higher juror utilization

18

rate and they have a higher minority population, then

19

you will end up with the leftover juries having a

20

lower minority population.

21

Now, the explanation for that is that you

22

choose the district judges -- you choose the district

23

jurors first.

24

just a -- I'm not instructed in this area.

25

were just to tell me, what do I think of that, I would

My question to you is:

39

If you

2

say I'm not sure.
I think you have fewer minorities, that's

3

true, but people get to serve closer to home.

4

now, can you enlighten me a little bit about this?

5

MR. LAWRENCE:

Yes.

Now --

Well, first of all,

6

Grand Rapids has several district courts, and the

7

largest one is the district court for the city of

8

Grand Rapids.

9

business of a large city is certainly going to be more

10
11

And as one would predict, the judicial

extensive than the judicial business in rural areas.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Of course.

Of

12

course, but we have to look at this on a proportional

13

basis, right?

14

number of jurors to the pool than -- than the small

15

rural county.

Grand Rapids is also sending a higher

16

MR. LAWRENCE:

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well -Your -- your theory

18

depends upon Grand Rapids drawing not just a

19

proportional number, if it's contributing 30 percent

20

and it draws 30 percent; your theory depends upon

21

Grand Rapids contributing 30 percent to the pool and

22

drawing 40 percent.

23

MR. LAWRENCE:

Well, I guess I would simply

24

say that the court administrator testified and the

25

district judge found that they had substantial
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

underrepresentation that was very noticeable, very

2

visible, a severe problem, and after my client's

3

trial, they -- they concluded that the best way of

4

dealing with this was to end the siphoning process,

5

which they did.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so, what -- what did

7

it result in?

It resulted over a 6-month period and a

8

difference between 18 percent underrepresentation and

9

15 percent.

And your adversary says that's not

10

statistically meaningful difference, that 3 percent,

11

because it only takes a difference of a couple of

12

people to change it from 18 to 15.

13

MR. LAWRENCE:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I -What's -- what's

15

unreasonable about that argument?

16

MR. LAWRENCE:

Well, I have two answers to

was eliminated was the spikes, like we had in my

19

client's month, 34.8, even though the average

20

underrepresentation was only 18.1.

21

The first one being that what -- one thing that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You can't -- you are

22

comparing apples and oranges, because your pre-spike

23

was over a year and your post-spike was over 6 months.

MR. LAWRENCE:

Okay.

Well, in the case of

2

Duren, you’re talking about -- they had a 10-month

3

period that was involved, but as for the numbers being

4

small, I can only refer you to cases that I very much

5

disagree with -- United States v. Sanchez-Lopez, cited

6

in my brief, where Hispanics comprised 5.59 percent of

7

the southern district of Idaho -- and the court

8

basically said:

9

who cares if there are Hispanics on the juries?

10

Since that's less than 10 percent,

same in United States --

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I wouldn't say that,

12

but I still haven't -- I will try again.

13

cases.

14

The

Forget the

As I’m hearing this, all I’m hearing is:

15

Well, if you let the -- if you say that the wider area

16

should choose first, you will get a higher number of

17

minorities, but very tiny number; I mean a very small

18

addition, one or two people.

19

they’re doing it, you'll lose those one or two people,

20

but you will let people serve closer to home.

21

And if you do it the way

So I just think -- as a person, not as a

22

judge -- that's why I am letting you answer it as a

23

judge -- but I mean, I’d say, well, it doesn't sound

like much of a big deal.

25

advantage in this, of the way they are doing it, so,

And -- and I do see an

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

now, you tell me what's -- what's wrong with that?

2

MR. LAWRENCE:

Okay.

Well, first of all,

3

Kent County is not really that big.

4

can drive from the farthest end of the county to

5

downtown Grand Rapids in approximately 20 to 30

6

minutes.

7

I bet members of this Court have a longer commute.

8
9

It's -- anybody

It wouldn't be that difficult to get there.

But, more importantly, the -- the fact that
you're only talking about 25 people out of 2,250

10

people simply means that the problem will be easy for

11

court administrators to solve, if they have an

12

incentive to do it.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How is that?

Don't

14

those people then have to become professional jurors?

15

They have to serve on every jury, or you’re going to

16

have the disproportion that the statistics show.

17

MR. LAWRENCE:

Well, the statistics showed,

18

for example, that African-Americans had a much higher

19

rate of not having an automobile.

20

well, if you have trouble getting a ride, you could

21

tell somebody, come on down anyway; or you can say,

22

that's all right, take the day off.

23

And so if you say,

And if African Americans have a very

24

substantial higher rate of single-parent households,

25

well, then, of course, it's going to be harder to get

that's okay, stay home; or you can say, try to get

3

down here anyway.

And the court -- and if somebody simply
didn't show up, statistics have shown, in the brief --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I stop you there for

7

a moment?

Because one of the things that was in the

8

Duren opinion was that a child care excuse would be

9

okay.

I think Justice White said at the end, now, I'm

10

not touching the typical hardship excuses, and one of

11

them was child care, and that is -- certainly, in the

12

early '70s, was going to disproportionately affect

13

women.

care exemption.

15

You have far fewer women if you give a child

hardship exemptions.

the things that happened is that, if somebody didn't ­

22

nothing wrong with granting excuses for genuine

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Sterling, I don't --

8

you seem to acknowledge that, to make your case, you

9

have to show that Grand Rapids district drew from the

10
11

pool a disproportionate number of people.
Why -- why do you have to prove that?

If

12

Grand Rapids contributes to the pool an inordinate,

13

disproportionate number of the minority -- blacks in

14

this case -- even if Grand Rapids simply took back a

15

proportionate number from the pool, it would still

16

have a disproportionate effect on reducing the number

17

of blacks in the overall pool, wouldn't it?

18

MR. LAWRENCE:

In order to solve this

19

problem, all that Kent County would have to do is to,

20

if you take people to district court, put back the

21

ones that aren't being used.

22

help, but, instead, they take an excess number, like

23

any court does, but the excess people are totally

24

removed from the system.

25

That would certainly

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your answer to

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Justice Scalia's question is -- is no, right?

2

the idea is, if Grand Rapids sends up a pool that’s 30

3

percent minority and if it takes back the same number

4

as everybody else, it's going to get -- the county is

5

going to get the same proportion.

6

It's only when they take back more.

Because

They

7

have the more heavily African-American pool, and they

8

are going to draw from it more than everybody else is

9

drawing from theirs, so there will be fewer African-

10
11
12
13

Americans to go to the county.
MR. LAWRENCE:

That is what's happening, but

I don't believe -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But you have no

14

evidence that Grand Rapids takes back more than its

15

share, proportionally, than anybody else.

16

MR. LAWRENCE:

We know that the -- as soon

there was an 18 percent, on average, comparative

7

difference and, after, 15 percent.

like a big change.

I thought it was agreed that, before,

MR. LAWRENCE:

That doesn't sound

But it's a step in the right

10

direction, and what we want to do is we want to

promote more minority participation on jurors --

12

juries, instead of creating a rule that tells court

13

administrators all over the country, the heat's off,

14

you don't have to do anything.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But a step -- a step in the

16

significant effect.

You were adducing that

22

Whether it's insignificant in the right direction or

23

the wrong direction doesn't matter.

24
25

MR. LAWRENCE:

Well, one element of the

entire system might be insignificant, but you are

underrepresentation.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I still don't -- I don't

Let's assume that Grand Rapids is -- is

entirely black, and its entire delegation that goes to

9

the pool are all black, okay?

And let's assume that

10

those blacks are 10 percent of the -- the totality,

11

and there are no blacks from anywhere else, okay?

12

Then Grand Rapids takes back simply the number of

13

people it -- it took, its set, which would be 10

14

percent, and it takes black -- takes back all of the

15

blacks, who are the Grand Rapids residents.

All of the other districts would thereby

17

have zero percent blacks instead of 10 percent, which

is what they ought to have.

MR. LAWRENCE:

Well, you are certainly

18

correct, and I would simply say that the people of

19

Grand Rapids looked up at the juries; 98 percent of

20

the time they saw nothing but white faces.

21

that Duren requires that the local system do something

22

about it.

23

give them flexibility.

There's a lot of options.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF B. ERIC RESTUCCIA,

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. RESTUCCIA:

I just have two brief

6

points.

7

Court that this is a case under AEDPA review, so that

8

the Michigan Supreme Court has to be not just

9

incorrect; it has to be objectively unreasonable.

10

One is that -- I want to just remind the

And its conclusion, I think probably the

11

easiest analysis here is the conclusion that there was

12

no showing of systemic exclusion, because Mr. Smith

13

failed to show that there was any underrepresentation

14

that arose from the jury assignment process, is

15

probably one of the strongest points, because if you

16

look at the 3 percent comparative disparity, that's

17

less than half of 1 percent absolute disparity.

18

one claims that that’s statistically significant.

19
20

No

So I think whether it's reviewed under
2254(d)(2) or 2254(e)(1), this Court should reverse.

21

Thank you.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

The case is submitted.

24

(Whereupon, at 11:14 a.m., the case in the

25

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
