Mr. Browning.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER G. BROWNING, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BROWNING:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether the word

13

"administrative" as used in the public disclosure bar of

14

the False Claims Act includes State audits and reports

15

or is limited to Federal sources.

16

If this Court were to hold that a relator

17

can simply copy a State report or a State criminal

18

indictment and then proceed with a qui tam action, there

19

will be a proliferation of opportunistic qui tam actions

20

brought under this statute.

21

Such construction of the statute would have

22

a devastating effect upon States, local governments, and

23

the Federal fisc.

24

Much of the work of State government

25

involves cooperative Federal and State programs.
3
Alderson Reporting Company

States

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have been an effective partner in fighting against fraud

2

and abuse with respect to those programs.

3

many States have turned to computerized software to

4

identify irregularities in connection with Medicaid

5

billings.

6

analyzing both its Medicare and its Medicaid databases

7

in order to identify doctors who bill in excess of

8

24 hours in a given day.

9

For example,

California has implemented a process of

Under the decision below, that investigatory

10

work can simply be copied by a qui tam plaintiff and an

11

action brought based upon that public report.

12

result is -

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The

But under your proposal a

14

State that itself is guilty of fraud can, in effect,

15

immunize -- if not immunize itself, at least render the

16

information unusable by conducting a hearing.

17

MR. BROWNING:

Well, Your Honor, the

18

government certainly argues that it would result in

19

State and local governments immunizing themselves from

20

qui tam liability.

21

With respect to States, the Fourth Circuit's

22

decision expressly includes reports of the State

23

government.

24

qui tam provisions, as a result of this Court's decision

25

in Vermont Department of Natural Resources v. United

States, of course, are not liable under the

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

States ex rel. Stevens.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And it's also the

3

original source, if -- if the relator is the original

4

source of the information.

5

MR. BROWNING:

Yes -- yes, Justice Ginsburg,

6

that -- even if there is a State report that a -- that

7

a -- is in the public domain, a local government could

8

still be sued under that document, if -- in spite of

9

that document, by either the United States or a qui tam

10

plaintiff that stands as an original source.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So -

But what about the

12

argument that Congress wanted to, in its most recent

13

provisions, wanted to expand qui tam availability and

14

this would -- if you would -- if you include State and

15

local reports, that will shrink the availability?

16

MR. BROWNING:

Your Honor, there is no

17

question that Congress looked at the pre-1986 public

18

disclosure bar, the provisions that existed between 1943

19

and 1986, and during that time frame an action, a qui

20

tam action, would be barred if it was based upon

21

information that was available to the -- the Federal

22

Government.

23

Congress decided that that cut off too many

24

qui tam actions, and as a result it reached a

25

compromise.

Many members of Congress wanted to totally
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

eliminate the government knowledge bar.

On the other

2

hand, the United States Department of Justice at the

3

time was arguing that the existing bar should remain in

4

effect as a result of abusive and frivolous qui tam

5

actions and their concern with respect to that.

6

compromise was reached in which the bar was completely

7

changed.

8

original source to bring the qui tam action, essentially

9

a relief valve that addressed Congress's concerns with

It was changed to allow for a -- for an

11

Wisconsin v. Dean.

12

So a

It also in the 1986 amendments set out

13

specific sources of information and directly identified

14

the type of public information that a qui tam action can

15

be based upon.

16

sources that might or might not be readily available to

17

the United States Government.

18

reports by a news media.

19

weekly publication of limited circulation does not

20

realistically put the government on notice of a

21

particular fraud.

22

That list, of course, includes many

For example, it includes

A -- an obscure article in a

The same can be true -- said with regard to

23

an action filed in Federal court, a private action

24

between civil litigants based upon diversity

25

jurisdiction.

If that -- if there is a summary judgment
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

motion filed in that case and there are a number of

2

depositions, one of which might indicate fraud, that are

3

filed in that summary judgment motion and the case

4

settles, that -- there will never be -- that summary

5

judgment motion wouldn't be reviewed by the Federal

6

district court judge.

7

that the filing of that document with the Federal court

8

would constitute a public disclosure under the first

9

clause of the public disclosure bar.

10

But still, there is no question

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It would be a -- would it

11

be a civil hearing?

12

a deposition to be a civil hearing?

13

A deposition -- you would consider

MR. BROWNING:

Your Honor, I am referring to

14

a deposition that is actually filed with the court in

15

connection with the summary judgment motion and the case

16

then settles.

17
18
19

Generally, the -- the courts have -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What -- what provision

would it come under?
MR. BROWNING:

Justice Scalia, the phrase

20

"criminal, civil, or administrative hearing."

21

courts have consistently read that word "hearing" as -

22

as including all courts' proceedings, not simply the

23

hearing itself, documents that are filed with the

24

clerk's office -

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The

Documents are -- documents

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

are a hearing?

2

MR. BROWNING:

Your Honor, the -- if

3

Congress had meant to limit that word "hearing" to

4

literally in-person oral arguments or in-person

5

testimony, it -- the result would be that a criminal

6

indictment could be copied by a qui tam plaintiff and an

7

action brought based upon that.

8
9

That, of course, was this Court's decision
in United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess.

The -- it is

10

clear from the congressional history that Congress

11

wanted to change that result by -- so Congress used the

12

word "hearing" that obviously meant more than -- than

13

simply -

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

MR. BROWNING:

16

Meant more than hearing?
Yes, Your Honor, and that's

the part of the problem, is -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's an argument that

18

doesn't go very far with me.

19

hearing.

20

MR. BROWNING:

I mean, "hearing" means

Your Honor, the -- the

21

problem is -- is that Congress really did not speak very

22

clearly at all with respect to the False Claims Act, and

23

so we're -- we're left with this mess of trying to

24

figure out exactly what Congress intended.

25

The phrase 8
Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE ALITO:

In your view, must an

2

administrative report be a report that is generated by

3

some government unit?

4

administration of a university, for example?

5

Could it be a report by the

MR. BROWNING:

Justice Alito, the

6

Petitioners would not read that phrase as -- that

7

broadly.

8

"administrative hearing," that would appear to indicate

9

action by the government.

10

When the Congress has used the word

And, under any of the dictionary definitions

11

of "administration," clearly a State administrative

12

proceeding, a State administrative report, would fall

13

within the scope of the dictionary definition.

14

believe the Court needs to read that language as

15

including private hospitals, private universities.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

We don't

But I'm not sure why.

17

You -- if -- unless "administrative" is informed by the

18

other adjectives in that prepositional phrase, "in a

19

congressional, administrative, or Government Accounting

20

Office," presumably GAO, "report," it -- unless that is

21

the -- you know, unless it's informed by those other

22

references, and that's why it has to be governmental,

23

I'm not sure how you limit "administrative" to

24

governmental reports.

25

MR. BROWNING:

Well, Your Honor, the public
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

disclosure bar uses the phrase "administrative hearing"

2

twice, and it's referring to Black's Law Dictionary.

3

defines "administrative hearing" as, essentially, a

4

hearing conducted by an administrative agency.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

When you say "twice," you

6

mean in the first clause that says "in a criminal,

7

civil, or administrative hearing"?

8
9

MR. BROWNING:

It

Yes, Your Honor.

And then in

the second clause it proceeds to use the phrase

10

"congressional, administrative, Government Accounting

11

Office hearing, audit, investigation, or report."

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there is a redundancy

13

there if the statute means what you say it does; it says

14

"administrative hearing" in both the first clause and

15

the second clause.

16

MR. BROWNING:

Yes, Your Honor, there is a

17

redundancy based upon Petitioner's construction of the

18

statute.

19

about redundancy in the False Claims Act.

20

again it uses the phrase "congressional, administrative,

21

or GAO."

22

But Congress was not particularly concerned
For example,

GAO, of course, is a body that reports to

23

Congress.

Its head is appointed by the President.

24

under any definition GAO would either be congressional

25

or administrative, so there is a redundancy there.
10
Alderson Reporting Company

So

There's also -

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I think there would

3

be a good lawsuit as to whether "congressional report"

includes a GAO report.

5

don't think it's at all as clear as you suggest.

6

I think that's a lawsuit.

MR. BROWNING:

I

Well, Justice Scalia, let me

7

also point out that there is a redundancy in connection

8

with the use of "audit, report, or investigation."

9

Essentially, Congress is using the same word to mean

10

essentially the same thing in that clause as well.

11

But yes, our reading does result in a

12

redundancy in the statute.

13

reads this entire clause as being limited to Federal

proceedings.

17

same phrase as having a different meaning in the same

18

sentence.

19

Of course, the government

They would urge a redundancy in the
But what's more important is this

Yes, Congress has created a redundancy, but

20

that is no more egregious than the fact that it used the

21

phrase "Government Accounting Office" to refer to what

22

was clearly the General Accounting Office.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, well, that argument

24

does not scare the government.

I think the government

25

would like to read "administrative hearing" in the

Alderson Reporting Company

1

first -- in the first phrase as being limited to Federal

2

administrative hearing as well.

3

MR. BROWNING:

Yes, Justice Scalia.

That is

4

their argument today.

5

United States ex rel. Poteet v. Medtronic, the

6

government argued in the Sixth Circuit that a qui tam

7

action should be dismissed based upon a State court

8

complaint.

9

They convinced the Sixth Circuit to accept

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that was on -- on the

12

basis of the first, the first phrase rather than the

13

second?

14
15

MR. BROWNING:

Yes, Your Honor, based upon

the first clause of the statute.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is this particular audit

17

report we are talking about, this is the audit report

18

was done by an independent accountant?

19

MR. BROWNING:

Is that -

Yes, Your Honor.

There are

20

two audit reports -- I'm sorry, there are two reports.

21

The key one is the report that identifies or asserts

22

that this work at issue should have been sent out by

23

For each one, there is a

So if -- since we have to decide it, it

there will be a lot of people, perhaps, who get rewards

18

at the Federal Government's expense who shouldn't have

21

the newspaper.

No question.

That if the

They front-run the government.

But if you are right, then they are going to

23

have to assign people to look at these obscure

24

administrative reports that didn't even get in the

25

So they want to do that, they don't have
13
Alderson Reporting Company

1

people to do it, and they say these people are

2

performing a service of sorts by reading them, the

3

4

it is, balanced.

5

And there

But they are the ones who suffer.

You see,

6

they suffer both ways.

They suffer if people don't tell

7

them; they suffer if in fact too many people are getting

8

unjustified rewards because the money comes from the

9

Federal Government, the 10 percent, 25 percent.

So if

10

they're the ones who suffer, should I not pay special

11

attention to their views as to how the balance works

12

out?

13

MR. BROWNING:

Well, Your Honor, Justice

14

Breyer, first of all, the government hasn't been

15

consistent.

16

Poteet, they have taken the exact opposite position with

17

regard to clause 1 in the first circuit.

18

As we pointed out in United States ex rel.

MR. BROWNING:

Yes.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

So my question wasn't that.

3

My question was, Should I or should I not give them a

4

little expertise weight on the grounds that they are the

5

ones who know it best, that they are the victims?

6

MR. BROWNING:

Well, I would suggest that

7

the weight that should be given is to the partners of

8

the Federal government, States and local governments

9

that are in the trenches administering these programs,

10

that will have tremendous difficulty if there is a rash

11

of qui tam actions that are brought that disrupt ongoing

12

Medicaid and other investigations.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How will that happen?

14

Meaning, how will they know, A, that the investigation

15

is occurring; and second, what can they do under Federal

16

or State law to require the disclose of ongoing

17

investigative materials?

18

I don't know -- mind you, I haven't studied

19

them -- but the ones that I am familiar with never

20

permit the public -- none of the Freedom of Information

21

Act-type legislation, never permit the disclosure of

ongoing investigative material.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, Congress undoubtedly did not intend to

make this 11th-hour change and have some substantive

did prior to that time.

Essentially what the lower

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK T. HURT

6

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

7
8
9

MR. HURT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The decision of the Fourth Circuit is

10

correct because the text of the False Claims Act compels

11

the result, and the purpose -- and also the purposes of

12

the 1986 amendments to the Act.

13

noted, Congress grouped the disclosure sources in

14

paragraph (a) of the public disclosure bar into three

15

distinct categories.

16

"administrative" which is at issue here is sandwiched

17

between the terms "congressional" -

18

As the Fourth Circuit

In CATEGORY 2, the term

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Let's begin at the

19

beginning, and that is with the first phrase with the,

20

what is it, "civil, criminal, administrative hearing."

21

Do you as the government -- do you agree with the

22

government that you have to insert "Federal" there, too?

23

Or does that phrase -

24

MR. HURT:

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

No.
-- include States?

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. HURT:

No, the -- the text of category 2

2

compels the result here, although we do believe that the

3

better view of category 1 is that it is also Federal as

4

well, and the context -- the overall context -

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Suppose -- suppose it

6

isn't?

Suppose the general "civil, criminal,

7

administrative" is read to mean -- include State.

8

shouldn't the second, if it we are picking Latin

9

phrases, be read in pari materia?

10

MR. HURT:

Because each of those categories

11

is distinct, not only grammatically, but as far as

12

function.

13

nature.

14

category is -- is news media and stands on its own.

15

Why

The first category is clearly adjudicative in
The second is non-adjudicative.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the third

Why -- why should we read

16

the second category back to alter the meaning of the

17

first, rather than reading the first phrase forward to

18

alter the meaning of the second?

19

clear when you read this, "in a criminal, civil, or

20

administrative hearing"; there is no limitation to

21

Federal on that.

22

and civil apply to -- to State civil and criminal

23

proceedings, right?

24

"administrative" simply means, obviously means State

25

administrative.

It -- it is absolutely

And you acknowledge that the criminal

So when you read that phrase,

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Now, why shouldn't I read that forward and

2

say, well, since it means State there, it must mean

3

State in the next one, in a congressional,

4

administrative, or GAO report.

5

MR. HURT:

The argument for category 2 is

6

less compelling, we agree.

The argument for category 1

7

is most compelling because these categories are distinct

8

and should be looked at as separate units for that

9

purpose.

You have category 2 as non-adjudicative, and

10

category 1 is adjudicative.

11

distinction there.

12

And so you have -- you have

If you were looking at the three categories

13

and, for instance, you don't say category 3 and say

14

category 3 is nongovernmental, so therefore we should

15

construe category 2 to include private administrative

16

reports.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

The question is, what sense

18

does that make?

I mean -- and I thought you said that

19

the category 1, which is the criminal proceeding, civil

20

or administrative proceeding, I thought you said it does

21

not apply to State proceedings in your view.

22

that was the better view.

23

MR. HURT:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

on that?

You said

Yes.
What's the state of the law

I thought it was virtually -- what is the
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

state of the law?

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You say that just as to

3

administrative.

Don't you acknowledge that the criminal

4

and civil apply to State criminal and civil?

5

MR. HURT:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

MR. HURT:

No, we think the better view is

that the whole category is -

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

MR. HURT:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13
14

You want the whole thing to

be just Federal?

8
9

No.

that.

The whole category?

-- exclusively Federal.
I think you'd have to say

But -- but now, what is the state of law on that?
MR. HURT:

The -- the court of appeals have

15

basically gone the other way, but they have looked at it

16

in a very superficial matter and have not really

17

directly addressed the issue.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

What are we supposed to do?

19

I mean, to me it makes no sense.

We are only talking

20

about things that don't get into the newspapers.

21

and the purpose of the Federal Government's reading of

22

this would be, look, we don't have people to go send

23

around to every -- read every State report.

24

So how to read these differently is a

6

problem for me.

7

But we are back to Justice Scalia's question, which to

8

me is the -- is the question here.

9

And I think that's on your side of it.

MR. HURT:

Well, the False Claims Act in

10

sections, the pertinent sections 3729 and 3730, refers

11

to the Federal Government many times but never with the

12

modifier "Federal."

13

14

They do it through context.

JUSTICE BREYER:

And in

Is there any history, which

15

I pay attention to -- is there any legislative history

16

or anything else that you can point to, to me that's

17

important, showing that that first criminal hearing

18

means just Federal?

19

MR. HURT:

Yes, the -- the legislative

20

history shows throughout -- beginning with the House and

21

Senate bills and going forward that these -- the earlier

22

version shows these were exclusively Federal.

the news media disclosures would be disseminated in

24

general to the general public and would put pressure on

25

the government to take action, and the government would

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

why

There was an explanation

for it in the opposing brief, that Congress in -- what
40
Alderson Reporting Company

was it -- 1986 didn't think that the legislature was

2

generating reports, audits, as distinguished from

4

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well -- well, Your

5

Honor, it is of course a -- a truism, that -- that

6

programs are administered by the executive branch more

7

than the legislative branch, but that is no reason to

8

think that Congress would have meant to exclude, if

9

those State legislatures did conduct a hearing with

10

respect to fraud by the State, exclude that as a public

11

disclosure.

12

State legislative reports is because it didn't include

State reports at all.

The reason that Congress didn't include

It was -

Well that -- that doesn't

follow like the night the day.

It could be, as it was

19

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

20

-- I think that it is more likely as -- as the

development and progress of the clause reflects, that

Congress was focused on what does the government know

whether this clause, the first -- what we call first and

22

References to States in connection with the

They Petitioner referred to the Dean case,

23

and, in fact, that was something that the -- the

24

legislative history refers to, but what was offensive

25

about the decision in the Dean case was that Wisconsin
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

had been the original source of the information, but had

2

been barred because it had provided that information to

3

the government.

4

And, under the government knowledge bar,

5

they had been precluded, so -- so Wisconsin would have

6

been taken care of under the original source provision,

7

but it doesn't reflect a view that States have a

8

particular distinctive role.

9

In fact, as this Court's decision in Cook

10

County reflects, municipalities are treated just like

11

any private corporation for purposes of the act.

12

can be defendants, they could be plaintiffs, qui tam

13

relators, but there is no reason to construe the statute

14

in a way that would allow a local government,

15

technically, to shield itself from qui tam suits by

disclosing the facts that would be the underlying

Do you think that the -

themselves from fraud, they are going to say, okay, we

will disclose it where anybody --a prosecutor could pick

24

it up, but we will take care of the qui tam obligation.

25

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Well, Your Honor, I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

think it's important to note that, in order to be a

2

public disclosure -- the second category at the very

3

least -- all that needs to have happened is that

4

information be disclosed to -- to one additional person.

5

That -- and that makes a lot of sense when

6

we are talking about disclosures of the government --

7

Federal government's own reports because, if the Federal

8

government is already investigating and pursuing the

9

fraud, one other person that finds out about it and then

10

files a qui tam action on the basis of the government's

11

own effort is precisely the situation that Congress

12

sought to preclude.

13

But it doesn't make any senses when we are

14

talking about a disclosure to an individual by a State

15

or local -

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there's lots of

17

disclosures -- there's lots of disclosures in Federal

18

reports that the government isn't pursuing.

19

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, we think that

20

the -- the disclosures -- the allegations in the types

21

of reports, audits, investigations, that are referenced

22

in the clause are the type that would evidence that the

23

government is pursuing them.

24

And -- but where a State -- perhaps a local

25

school board discloses facts that might give rise to an
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

allegation of fraud in a hearing where there was only

2

one or two members of the public in attendance, there is

3

no reason to think that that information is going to be

4

brought to the Federal government's attention.

5

The purpose of the bar is to balance --

6

Congress was seeking to balance two rules.

7

encourage qui tam relators to bring information and

8

bring suit where the information was unlikely to be

9

something that the government -- Federal government was

10

One is to

focusing on.

11

Where the Federal government was able to

12

protect itself and bring this suit on its own, then

13

there's no reason for the Federal government to have to

14

share its recovery.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But why can't it -- why

16

can't it protect itself if these reports are in its

17

19

20

You, yourself, make it very clear that the

22

government -- it isn't keeping track of all of those

23

other sources.

24
25

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, Your Honor,

Petitioners' reference to this audit being in the
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

possession of the government -- it's happenstance that

2

this particular report, the Crisp & Hughes report, was

3

sent to the Federal government official.

4

But the vast majority of State and local

5

governmental investigations, audits, and reports, are

6

not going to be given to the Federal government, and

7

even though they are -- they cite the Single Audit Act,

8

which is only a very narrow subset of audits that States

9

or local governments perform -- do not actually disclose

10
11

the allegations of the fraud.
In order to get to the actual information of

12

the fraud, the -- first of all, it would have to be

13

brought to the attention of the relevant Federal agency.

14

Usually, the cognizant agency is the one that has the

15

most money at stake, but the fraud may have to do with a

16

different Federal program, so it has to be brought to

17

the attention of the program whose interests are

18

actually at stake.

19

They have to go beyond the report that is -

20

that is publicly available in the clearinghouse website,

21

which tells you virtually nothing, to an underlying

22

report which is itself, generally, fairly vague, and all

23

Petitioners say is that the working papers of the

24

auditor are available to the government, not even in the

25

government's possession, they are available to the
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

government if it requests it.

2

The government has to drill down many levels

3

before it necessarily is going to know about that fraud.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Isn't that argument

5

suggesting that the court didn't even need to reach this

6

issue, even assuming that the State administrative

7

reports are included in the bar?

8
9
10

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

No -- no, Your

Honor, I don't think so.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, aren't you arguing

11

that what was in this audit report wasn't sufficient to

12

show the fraud?

13

That's not your argument?

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

No -- again, this

14

report here did have information that was indicative of

15

fraud, and this report -

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In which way?

17

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Excuse me?

Which way?

All it said

19

was that this person wasn't chosen by bidding.

20

aren't there situations in which non-bids are permitted?

21

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

But

There -- there were

22

multiple allegations.

One of the allegations underlying

23

the relator's claim is that the government -- the county

24

certified that certain procedures were followed that

25

would have included a requirement that it be bid out,
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and that it was not.

2

Another was that certain work was paid for

3

or billed for, but wasn't performed or was not performed

4

well, so there were -- there were different allegations,

5

and where that would be disclosed to a single person,

6

that would constitute a public disclosure, at least with

7

respect to Federal -

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, the Attorney

General can always bring suit, right?

I mean, all we

10

are arguing about is whether this information that is in

11

the in the State and local thing could be the basis of a

12

qui tam suit.

13

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But only if we -

If the government finds out

15

about it, the Attorney General could always bring suit,

16

right?

17

And what is at

18

issue here is whether the Federal government is ever

19

going to learn of the fraud.

your comments or your questions about legislative

very little because of the many changes in the Senate

5

was not a conference committee report, so we won't know

6

the nature of the compromise.

7

At most, the legislative history helps us to

8

show what Congress was generally concerned about, and

9

throughout the original committee, the Senate and House

10

report, there is a concern about qui tam actions based

11

upon public information.

that.

against you.

Now, I agree with you about

I think it's the silence, though, that might cut

MR. BROWNING:

Well -

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

And the reason that it's -

17

it's basically silence -- the reason I am thinking that

18

cuts against you is because of this sorting of the

19

context where they are focusing on Federal.

20

And, if everybody is working in that

21

context, then nothing said about State means they are

22

just assuming it's all applying to Federal.

23

Now, what I'm looking for, you might be able

to put your finger on, is something that shows that my

The very change that we are talking about -

5

the -- the change to the public disclosure bar was a

6

result of a push by the National Association of Attorney

7

Generals to actually change the public disclosure bar to

9
10

That is why the public disclosure bar
includes an original source provision.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

To -- to follow up,

12

I think it was a question that Justice Breyer asked

13

earlier.

Do you have any tie-breaker on your side?

14

I mean, if we do decide the arguments are

15

pretty much in equipoise, the suggestion was that the

16

Federal government is both the beneficiary and the loser

17

in the qui tam actions, from the sense they lose a

18

percentage of recovery, and so we ought to let them

19

strike the balance.

20

What argument do you have on your side?

21

MR. BROWNING:

Your Honor, again, that our

22

concern from the perspective of the States -- and it's a

23

concern shared by local governments -- is the reading

24

that Respondents advocate will produce a flood of qui

25

For example, is -- do -- have we

5

MR. BROWNING:

We are -- we are partners -

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Which the Federal

7

government doesn't care about, right?

8

MR. BROWNING:

9

The Federal government has, I

think, taken a very short-sighted view because these

10

sort of qui tam actions will be very disruptive to what

11

the Federal government's partners are actually doing in

12

the trenches in administering these programs.

13

Moreover, the Federal False Claims Act -- it

14

is clear that it is not exclusively Federal.

15

was amended in 1986, Congress changed Section 3732(b),

16

which allowed pendent State claims to be brought, so a

17

State, if there is a Federal false claims action, could

18

intervene to protect the State's portions of the -- the

19

monies that are at issue.

20

When it

Moreover, in Section 3733(l)(7)(A), the

21

civil investigative demand provisions, Congress

22

expressly viewed the word "administrative" to include,

23

not only Federal administrative proceedings, but State

24

administrative proceedings as well.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

So your point here is -- I

54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

will put it in cash terms, is the Federal government,

2

who will pay a lot of qui tam lawyers some percent to go

3

and look through all these State criminal hearings and

4

State reports and all these things that didn't get into

5

the newspaper and to bring cases, so it may be cheaper

6

to pay them then it would be to hire staff to do that.

7

Now, your point is that they get a little

8

over-enthusiastic sometimes, and they can bring actions

9

that maybe not be so well-justified, and the -- the

10

Federal government is going to have to hire people to

11

sort those out anyway, and so would the States in that

12

kind of mess.

13

Is that your point?

14

MR. BROWNING:

Yes.

They will be very
