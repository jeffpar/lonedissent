(10:09 a.m.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Cole.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID D. COLE
ON BEHALF OF HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT, ET AL.
MR. COLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This as-applied challenge asks whether the

13

government can make it a crime for Ralph Fertig and the

14

Humanitarian Law Project to speak in association with

15

the Kurdistan Workers Party.

16

advocate for legal reform in Congress and the UN, to

17

write and distribute articles supportive of Kurdish

18

rights, to inform the Kurds of their international human

19

rights and remedies, and to advise them on peaceful

20

conflict resolution.

21

Kurdistan Workers Party engages in a wide range of

22

lawful activities and that plaintiffs seek to support

23

only lawful ends.

24
25

Specifically, they seek to

It is undisputed that the

The government has a concededly compelling
interest in combatting terrorism, yet it has not even

1

tried to defend these prohibitions under strict

2

scrutiny.

3

proposition that criminalizing plaintiffs' speech is a

4

regulation of conduct, not speech, and therefore can be

5

upheld under O'Brien.

6

Instead, it rests its entire case on the

That view is mistaken for two fundamental

7

reasons.

8

is inapplicable where the government prohibits pure

9

speech --

10
11

First, as this Court has already held, O'Brien

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. COLE:

Some of my clients’ speech?
Some of the speech of your

client.

15

MR. COLE:

I don't think -- I don't think

16

any of it could be prohibited, Your Honor, unless the

17

government can satisfy the stringent scrutiny that this

18

Court applies when Congress seeks to prohibit pure

19

speech.

20
21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. COLE:

I think that certainly all of the

speech that I've just identified, which is the core -JUSTICE STEVENS:

You identified quite a

bit.

1

MR. COLE:

Right.

Yes.

It’s core -- and

2

I think the reason, Your Honor, is it is core political

3

speech on issues of public concern.

4

only lawful, peaceable activities.

5

upheld the criminal prohibition of lawful speech on

6

issues of public concern.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It is advocating
This Court has never

Well, could the

8

government, I assume -- I assume you will say "yes" --

9

could the government forbid any NGO or other

10

organization or person from giving tsunami aid to one of

11

these organizations, from giving them money?

12
13

MR. COLE:
Honor.

14
15

I think money is different, Your

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could they -- could the

government prohibit that?

16

MR. COLE:

I think money is different

17

because it's -- it's conduct, not speech.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Okay.

Let's assume the

19

government could prohibit that.

20

is:

21

the terrorist organization how to get the tsunami aid?

22

Then the next question

Could the government prohibit speech instructing

MR. COLE:

Right.

And I think -- - I think,

23

Your Honor, that the answer is no, for the -- unless the

24

government can meet the higher standard of scrutiny that

25

applies when you’re regulating speech.

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

2

MR. COLE:

3

would necessarily be Brandenburg.

4

order to apply -- to decide this case, Your Honor,

5

all the Court has to find is that when the speech

6

advocates solely lawful, peaceable activities of the

7

sort advocated here, that's not sufficient.

8

specific -- we've suggested a specific intent standard,

9

which is lower than Brandenburg, would be appropriate --

10

Brandenburg?

Well, I don't know whether it

I think for -- in

I think

But -- but if you get

11

tsunami money, that frees up your other assets for

12

terrorist money.

13

teaching how to get that money?

14

So why can't the government forbid

MR. COLE:

Well, again, Your Honor, that --

15

if the government -- if the connection between the

16

speech and the government's concern were sufficiently

17

close, then maybe it could.

18
19
20
21
22

But the problem --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why can't there

be -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Then what's the test?

Is it -- you say it's not Brandenburg?
MR. COLE:

I think the test is whether the

23

-- whether the speech -- when it's speech, I think the

24

test is whether the speech has been provided with

25

specific intent or knowledge that it will further

What if it goes -And that applies --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if it goes to

5

the mere existence of a group?

Let's say you have the

6

Nazi Party, and you are talking about advice or speech on

7

some purely mundane issue.

8

9

hospital, but the government decides that anything that

The Nazis have a hospital,

Can the government make

I'm thinking of something like Regan v.

Well, two answers.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

1

an example that doesn't implicate the particulars of

2

the issue today.

MR. COLE:

So I think -- the

4

reason I ask, Your Honor, is that it may make a

5

difference if we are at war.

14

MR. COLE:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

16

legitimizes it.

17

better.

18

the party, the group, will be legitimized.

19

It's going to make their hospital run

People are going to like their hospital.

MR. COLE:

Right.

So

Well, I think all the

20

Court held in Regan and Zemel was that it is permissible

21

for the government to regulate conduct -- not speech --

22

travel, and economic transactions, not speech.

23

were essentially O'Brien cases.

Those

24

And, in fact, in Regan the Court

25

distinguished a prohibition on travel to Cuba across the
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

board from a prohibition directed at a group, the

2

Communist Party, in the Kent and Aptheker cases, where

3

the Court held that --

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if you can't travel

5

there -- suppose you want to travel there so that you can

6

meet with and discuss lawful activities with people

7

there.

8
9

If you can't get there, you can't speak.
MR. COLE:

That's right, Your Honor.

But

that -- but that's essentially an O'Brien situation.

10

The prohibition is on a conduct, whether it's

11

draft card burning or travel.

12

to engage in that conduct says, I want to do it for

13

speech purposes.

14

a freer hand in regulating conduct than speech, and,

15

therefore, as long as you’re regulating the

16

non-expressive element of the conduct, we'll apply

17

O'Brien.

18
19

22

But the Court says the government has

But what this Court has said is that when -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

2

situation?

3

How would that be different than the Cuba

MR. COLE:

Well, then, if it's -- if it's

4

traveling for the purpose of association, then it would

5

be targeted at association, not at the conduct of

6

travel.

The whole --

7
8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But it's no different

than the Cuba situation.

9

MR. COLE:

No, but the whole point of the

Cuba -- the Cuba travel cases is that -- again, as this

11

Court said, it was an across-the-board ban.

12

apply to different political groups.

It applied to

13

anyone who sought to travel to Cuba.

And it was about

14

travel.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It did not

Well, suppose it's a ban

16

just for travel to meet with terrorist organizations,

17

Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical.

18

MR. COLE:

Right.

Well, then I think -- I

19

think that's -- that’s different from this case, right,

20

because this case -- suppose it's a ban on speech

21

wherever it

22
23
24
25

occurs.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But what about the -- what

about the hypothetical?
MR. COLE:

Right.

Well, with respect to the

hypothetical, I think the question, Your Honor, would be
11

1

whether the government's interest in banning that travel

2

is unrelated to the associational or speech purposes.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's what the Chief

Justice says:

5

inure to the benefit of a terrorist organization, and we

6

have a governmental interest in not allowing that.

7

In any context, support ultimately will

Your Honor, that the government has a compelling interest

in cutting off aid to terrorism.

10

it can do

The question is whether

so by criminalizing pure speech.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it hasn't criminalized

12

speech.

It has criminalized providing aid and

13

assistance to these organizations.

14

assistance that is prohibited is not in the form of

15

speech, but it happens to include speech as well.

16

MR. COLE:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Most of that aid and

Right, but, Justice Scalia -I think that’s quite

18

different from a law that is directed explicitly at

19

speech.

20

MR. COLE:

Well, I don’t -- I think it's not

21

in this -- in this sense, Justice Scalia.

22

statute that banned aid to overthrow the United States

23

Government.

24

assassinate the president; two, you can't provide bombs and

25

weapons to groups attempting to overthrow the government;

And it had three provisions:

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Imagine a

One, you can't

Official

1

three, you can't advocate overthrow of the government.

2

If that were applied to someone for speaking in advocacy,

3

we wouldn't say it's a regulation of speech.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's not the right --

5

that's not the right number three.

6

three is you cannot advise and assist an organization

7

that is seeking to overthrow the government.

8

what is at issue here, not --

9

MR. COLE:

10

The right number

That's

Well, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- not independently promoting

11

the objectives of these terrorist organizations.

12

your clients are free to do that.

13

MR. COLE:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Your --

Well -But when they assist

15

the organization by providing advice, that's a different

16

matter.

17

MR. COLE:

Well, the government says if

18

they -- even if they speak in conjunction with the group,

19

they -- and they’re providing a benefit to the government,

20

that's prohibited.

21
22
23

So, for example --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

When they provide a

benefit, right?
MR. COLE:

So, for example, under that view,

24

the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the L.A. Times,

25

all of which published op-eds by Hamas spokespersons -13
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Hamas is on the list -- thereby providing a benefit to

2

Hamas, working with the Hamas spokesperson, they’re all

3

criminals.

Well, we -- we can cross

5

that bridge when we come to it.

6

MR. COLE:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But -This is an as-applied

8

challenge, and we are talking about the kind of advice

9

and assistance that your clients want to give.

11

MR. COLE:
no --

12
13

Right, and, Your Honor, there's

It is, Your

Honor.

Times, and he's not President Carter, but it's the same

17

sort of support, right?

18

I mean, it’s -- Ralph Fertig is not the New York

President Carter --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, no.

No, no.

I thought

19

that he was -- he wants to meet with the people.

20

New York Times didn't meet with Hamas to tell them how

21

great their editorial was.

MR. COLE:

The

No, but it's not about -- it's

23

not about whether you meet with them.

24

whether you coordinate with them, and they've certainly

25

coordinated with the Hamas spokesperson in editing and
14

It's about

1

accepting and then publishing his editorial.

2

that would be providing a service.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

"coordinating" means, doesn't it?

5

that in the next case.
MR. COLE:

It would --

It depends on what

4

6

That is --

And we can determine

Well, let me -- let me also

7

answer it this way, Justice Scalia:

If you look at the

8

specific speech which our clients seek to engage in, it

9

includes writing and distributing literature in

10

conjunction with the Kurdistan Workers Party in the

11

United States advocating their support.

12

different from the New York Times?

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

How is that

Supposing that -- what you

14

say is you want to engage in political advocacy on

15

behalf of the Kurds.

16

Suppose -- and these are two hypotheticals.

17

one, your clients, let's say, or some other people,

18

know that what the Kurds' hypothetical plan is, is to

19

pretend they're a political advocacy organization,

20

but to go around shooting the people who don't agree

21

with them.

22

knows it.

23

Okay?

That's your words.

All right.
Hypothetical

Case one, the hypothetical defendant

In case two, he doesn't know it, but it's true.
MR. COLE:

Well, I think -- I think if

24

you -- if you specifically intend and know that your aid

25

will further the group in its terrorist activities, then
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it's not protected speech.

2

don't know that and you don't intend that, and in this

3

case --

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

But if you're -- if you

And that goes for all forms of

5

training?

No form of training or expert assistance can

6

be prohibited unless the individual specifically intends

7

to further -- that the training will be used to carry

8

out terrorist activities?

9

MR. COLE:

10

as-applied challenge.

11

training in what international human rights consist of,

12

in how to advocate for international human rights, and

13

how to advocate politically in Congress and other bodies.

14

That's the speech that's at issue here.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, Justice Alito, this is an
So the question simply is whether

Well, just out of curiosity,

16

I thought your position was that no form of training or

17

assistance could be prohibited -- -

JUSTICE ALITO:

Amendment.

No, I was just --- consistent with the First

That's not your position?
MR. COLE:

No.

I think -- I think, again,

22

it depends upon the form of speech.

23

of training that are so closely connected to the -- to

24

the end that Congress seeks to -- legitimately seeks to

25

proscribe, like training in bombmaking or training in
16
Alderson Reporting Company

There may be some forms

Official

1

military exercises.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The end that Congress seeks

3

to proscribe is the existence of these terrorist

4

organizations.

5

that when you aid any of their enterprises you’re

6

aiding the organization.

7

support among -- among the Palestinians by activities

8

that are perfectly lawful, perhaps running hospitals,

9

all sorts of things.

10

MR. COLE:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the theory of the legislation is

Hamas, for example, gained

Right.
But that is what fosters the

12

terrorist organization and enables the terrorist

13

activities.

14

Any assistance you provide to these organizations cannot

15

be separated from assistance to their terrorist

16

activities.

17

Why isn't that a reasonable connection?

MR. COLE:

Right.

Well, Your Honor,

18

that is precisely the argument that the United States

19

made to this Court in Scales.

20

from the government's brief:

21

proscribed even though the activity be expended along

22

lines not otherwise illegal, since active support of any

23

kind aids the organization in achieving its own illegal

24

purposes."

25

And here I’m quoting
"Active membership can be

6

held you've got to distinguish between that aid and

10

lawful speech.

The Court said the same thing in De

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Cole, as I remember,

Scales upheld a conviction, wasn’t --

14

MR. COLE:

It did, Justice Ginsburg, but

15

only because it interpreted the statute to be -- to be

16

limited to specific -- to members -- active membership

17

that is specifically intended to further the illegal

18

ends of the group, precisely -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

But it didn’t -- it was not

20

21

difficult case for me.

2

MR. COLE:

Right.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Then you say:

"Nor does it

4

involve speech advocating or teaching criminal or violent

5

activity."

6
7

But it does involve speech, let's say arguendo,
that is tantamount to material support.

8

MR. COLE:

Well, I -- right, but --

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose the speech is

10

tantamount to material support in that it legitimizes,

encourages, or strengthens the organization.

speaker at the meeting.

19

challenge.

20

Now, what's the

perfectly aligned with this case.

You can't give

tsunami aid, but the question is:

Can you instruct

14

these organizations about how to get tsunami aid?

And then these organizations get tsunami

they also have more money to --

21

to do something, and that something is the kind of thing

22

that the First Amendment protects.

23

GENERAL KAGAN:

I am talking about the

24

is the teaching the foreign terrorist organization how

25

to petition international bodies in order to get various

kinds of support, financial or otherwise, that will

2

strengthen those organizations in everything that they

3

do.

What Congress decided --

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Fine, and if a reasonable

5

person would know that, that it's going to help them,

6

then it is unlawful, if it's going to help them and a

7

reasonable person would think it was going to help them

8

in their unlawful activities.

9

GENERAL KAGAN:

But we're not --

Congress was the reasonable

10

person here.

11

you help a terrorist -- foreign terrorist organization's

legal activities, you’re also helping the foreign

13

terrorist organization's illegal activities.

19

kinds of reasons that Justice Kennedy was suggesting by

20

that hypothetical.

21

What Congress decided was when you help

That's the entire theory behind this

JUSTICE ALITO:

And doesn't that lead to --

22

kind of logically lead to the conclusion that mere

23

membership could be prohibited?

24

someone could be a member of one of these organizations

25

without providing a service to the organization?

Could you explain how

Simply

by lending one's name as a member -- that might be

regarded as a service.

3

5

organization.

6

If you attended a meeting and

GENERAL KAGAN:

I -- I actually don't

7

think -- I mean, Congress clearly did not mean to

8

include that.

9

Congress used make that pretty clear.

And I think that the normal words that
When you think

10

about personnel, when you think about training, when you

11

think about expert advice and assistance, even when you

12

think about service, you -- the notion that I am serving

13

a terrorist organization simply by the act of membership

14

I think would not be correct.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And -Why do you say Congress

16

clearly did not intend that?

17

guessed that you are providing a service or personnel

when you make yourself a member of the organization.

Why do you say Congress clearly did not intend it?

20

GENERAL KAGAN:

You know, I would have

That is certainly not the

21

way the government reads the statute, and that's not the

22

way the government has ever read the statute.

23

indeed, the government, as we discussed in our brief,

24

believes that there are certain kinds of joint

25

activities that would be allowed by the statute.

And,

Now, that's not to say that Congress could

2

not have gone farther.

3

one is regulating dealings with a foreign organization,

4

it's possible that Congress could have gone further.

5

But we understand the statute and -- and I think there's

6

a -- I think, quite reasonably, as providing only

7

material support, a true service, something that will

8

help the foreign organization in whatever it does.

9

In this specific context, where

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, but petitioning the

10

United Nations -- and that's what you are teaching them

11

-- does not, on its face, seem to me to be something

12

that reasonably you would think was going to aid them in

13

their unlawful objectives, but for the realm of ideas.

14

Now --

15

GENERAL KAGAN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

This would be --- and then Congress put a

thing in here which says:

So

And I think you are exactly

right about that.
JUSTICE BREYER:

And is there any evidence that

something like that would, in fact, but for the realm of

ideas, help this organization commit its terrorist acts?

25

GENERAL KAGAN:

Justice Breyer, I believe
42

that the legislative record is quite clear that Congress

2

thought that various kinds of aid given to the legal and

3

legitimate activities of the terrorist organization, in

4

fact, further the aims of the -- in fact, further the

5

illegal and illegitimate goals.

6

Congress made findings about the fungibility

7

of these resources.

Congress said over and over that

the congressional definition of what kind of training

49
Alderson Reporting Company

lower court decisions, it further clarified and defined

2

the word “training” and the word “expert advice and

assistance,” I have to say I think that Congress's own

responsive and responsible, that it really took into

Well, first of all,

20

respect to any kind of facial challenge or with respect

21

to this challenge --

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

what you’re saying, what I just said:

25

terrible stuff, but they are not entitled under the

50
Alderson Reporting Company

Constitution to have a lawyer in the United States who

does legal work like filing amicus briefs.

3

GENERAL KAGAN:

5

representation, whether it's a Sixth Amendment claim or

6

a due process claim that might exist in criminal cases,

7

that might exist in habeas cases, that might exist in

8

civil cases, then the government believes that the

9

statute should be read so as not to include that.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why do these hypotheticals

11

make any difference?

12

We should look to the activities that this organization

wants to conduct, unless -- unless you think that there

The court of appeals specifically said it's not vague

even knowing what they intend to do, it's kind of hard

21

to decide whether that's based on specialized knowledge

or not.

GENERAL KAGAN:

I think it -- it actually is

pretty clear in this case.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It was my understanding that

Are there any prosecutions that are -- that

through peaceful means?
GENERAL KAGAN:

Justice Ginsburg, I think

12

that this is not the typical case.

13

a case that might never have reached this Court, except

14

that it was brought as a declaratory judgment action.

15

For the most part, what the government prosecutes are

16

cases which involve a wide variety of support to foreign

17

terrorist organizations.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

This is, of course,

Specifically, does this

particular man have to be prosecuted?

20

GENERAL KAGAN:

I'm sorry?

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Is this particular

Justice Stevens, I do

JUSTICE STEVENS:

GENERAL KAGAN:

Of course, that's a

8

different thing as to how prosecutorial judgment is used

9

to decide which are the high-priority cases and which

10

are the low-priority cases.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But in essence, this is an

12

action to enjoin a potential prosecution against

13

somebody for making a potential speech?

14

what we are fighting about, I think.

GENERAL KAGAN:

That's really

MR. COLE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

of strict scrutiny.

13

California applied that statute to the words on Mr.

interested in the words on his jacket, we are interested

MR. COLE:

object because there are actually many cases, and FEC v.

again, the notion is somebody who is told you can meet

5

with a group, you can discuss with a group -- in fact,

6

the House report says that you are free to speak with

7

and on behalf of a designated group.

But,

8

But then you have a statute that says, if

9

you advocate in any coordinated way, if you tell them

10

anything that’s derived from specialized knowledge, if

11

you tell them anything of specific skill, you're --

12

you're engaged in a crime and you could go to jail for

13

15 years.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

remains of your case?

24

MR. COLE:

25

If O'Brien applies, what

If O'Brien applies, then I think

the Court would still be applying the scrutiny that
60
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

asks, is there a reasonable fit -- is there a reasonable

2

fit between the specific speech that's at issue here,

3

speech on issues of public concern, advocating only

4

lawful activity, and the -- and that the government

5

legitimately seeks to further, which is stopping support

6

for terrorism?

7

Now --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That analysis of the

8

activities that you are proposing has not been done by

9

the lower courts, correct?

10

MR. COLE:

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

Well, the lower courts struck -They -- they haven't --

they struck it on vagueness grounds, but none --

13

MR. COLE:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Right.

The --- none of the courts

15

either subjected this to strict scrutiny or the

16

reasonable fit --

17

MR. COLE:

No, and, in fact, the government

18

has never even attempted to defend the statute under strict

19

scrutiny, because I think it clearly could not satisfy

20

strict scrutiny.

21

scrutiny is what must be applied here.

22

In addition --

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And under this -- under Cohen, strict

Well, why don't -- why

24

don't we remand it to the lower courts to apply strict

25

scrutiny if we agree with you that O'Brien doesn't apply

2

MR. COLE:

I think it would be appropriate

3

to remand for -- for application of strict scrutiny if

4

you read it that O'Brien doesn't apply.

5

O'Brien also doesn't apply if the statute is

6

not content neutral.

7

all aid; it doesn't even bar all speech.

8

unlimited provision of religious materials, even if they

9

11

So -- so there are -- the -- the lower

12

court, again, found that the statute was vague, that our

13

clients were reasonably chilled, that they had a right

14

to engage in this activity.

15

result either through vagueness, or you can reach it by

16

applying strict scrutiny, or I think because the fit is

17

so poor here, and because -- and the vagueness, in fact,

18

undermines the fit, because people are chilled from

19

engaging even in speech that the government doesn't want

20

I think you can reach that

Mr. Cole, there were

congressional findings that money is fungible first for

2

legitimate means, that it's going to be siphoned off and

3

used for illegitimate means.

4

MR. COLE:

Right.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, why isn't that enough,

6

either under strict scrutiny or a lesser standard,

7

reasonable fit standard, to say that you can't teach

8

these groups how to get money?

9

MR. COLE:

Right.

Well, one -- well, we’re not

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We’re seeking

No, one of your -- one

14

of your stated aims, at least of one of the groups is to

15

teach them how to get aid for tsunami relief.

MR. COLE:

Right.

That -- that claim has

17

been mooted because the LTTE is no longer -- has no role

18

in Sri Lanka.

19

to do with money.

20

So what’s left is solely -- has nothing

Secondly, Congress only made a finding about

21

money.

At the same time that it made a finding that

22

money is fungible, it said this is a statute -- and

23

this is from the House report -- only affects one’s

24

contribution of financial and material resources and

25

does not prohibit speaking in concert with and on behalf

3

that what our clients want to do is -- should be protected.
