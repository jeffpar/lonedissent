Mr. Srinivasan.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. SRINIVASAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
The diversity statute deems a corporation a

12

citizen of, quote, "the State where it has its principal

13

place of business," closed quote.

14

erred in holding that Petitioner Hertz is a citizen of

15

California, even though Hertz is headquartered in New

16

Jersey and conducts over 80 percent of its operations

17

outside the State of California, and even though, under

18

the court's approach, national corporations could

19

regularly be deemed California citizens if they conduct

20

operations in that State that are proportional to the

21

State's population.

22

The Ninth Circuit

The better reading of the statute, in our

23

view, is that it points to the location of the

24

corporation's headquarters, the site from which a

25

corporation directs and controls all the company's
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

operations throughout all of its locations.

And that is

2

particularly the correct reading when the statutory

3

language is considered in light of two considerations.

4

First, the strong preference for simplicity

5

and ease of administration in jurisdictional rules; and

6

second, Congress's purposes in 1958 to preserve

7

diversity jurisdiction for corporations in 48 States and

8

to deny access to diversity jurisdiction only in one

9

State, the State where the corporation had its home or

10
11

principal place of business.
Now, with respect to the ordinary meaning of

12

the statutory text, the critical phrase is "principal

13

place of business."

14

term define the term "principal place of business" as

15

corporate headquarters, and that is fortified by Federal

16

and State laws, which also define the term as "company's

17

headquarters" -

18

And dictionary definitions of that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, the problem

19

with every test is that you can find an exception that

20

makes the application ridiculous.

21

Let's assume that we accept that

22

headquarters or nerve center may have some applicability

23

to a corporation that has a business in a variety of

24

different States.

25

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Sure.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

That's -

your situation is perhaps the most attractive -

3

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Right.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- because whether

5

California has 20 percent and Florida 14 or 15 percent,

6

to me the differences are not terribly substantial.

7

can imagine McDonald's having 1 percent in every part of

8

the world, and how do you choose then?

9

say, then you -- you go back to headquarters.

10

I

California would
But I

don't know why you start there.

11

But let's posit the simpler situation.

12

Headquarters in New Jersey, but everything else is in

13

California.

14

and it depends on how you define "headquarters."

15

they have three corporate executives, that's the entire

16

extent -- or let's say one corporate executive who

17

started the company and who lives in New Jersey, and he

18

flies out to California half the time and runs the

19

business from there but happens to live in New Jersey.

20

Then you would say diversity is still New Jersey,

21

correct?

22

Your test would ignore completely that -

MR. SRINIVASAN:

We would, Your Honor.

If

But

23

let me -- let me start first with accepting Your Honor's

24

premise, that in the situation of a multistate

25

corporation with -- with diverse operations, the
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

principal place of business would be the headquarters.

2

Now, I take your point that there are

3

situations in which the test may not seem so

4

straightforward, but we think even in the -- the

5

hypothetical that Your Honor posits, the better

6

answer -- at least our first submission would be, the

7

better answer is the headquarters would control.

8

that's for a couple of reasons.

9

And

Although, again, the one exception that we

10

would have to our rule is exactly Your Honor's

11

hypothetical, and let me just bracket that.

12

reason we think, first and foremost -

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now, the

But you have not

14

articulated a -- at least to me, a meaningful principle

15

in which to set that exception.

16

somehow to the test and why the test in some situations

17

would have applicability and others may not.

18
19
20

MR. SRINIVASAN:

It has to be tied

Sure.

And let me -- let

me JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because I don't know the

21

difference between one headquarters and two places to do

22

business or three, but I can still see that some

23

factoring has to be done when the places of business are

24

more limited.

25

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I -- well, we think

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

first and foremost that the headquarters' role would

2

apply even in Your Honor's situation, and I will get to

3

that to the exception -- fashioning the exception in

4

just one second -

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But your case doesn't

6

call for that judgment, because you have a multistate

7

corporation, and it -- I assume you would be satisfied

8

with saying that when a corporation has dispersed

9

operations, it doesn't have its business center or its

10

headquarters -- doesn't have its business center

11

dominant in any one State, that it's dispersed, then you

12

take the headquarters, because there's no way to pick

13

among -- choose all the others, and it certainly isn't

14

worth the labor to try to do that.

15

So you could have a rule that says,

16

dispersed across many States, you pick headquarters.

17

And that -- you don't have to urge anything further.

18

MR. SRINIVASAN:

No, absolutely, Justice

19

Ginsburg.

20

of the case in -- in that light.

21

And we would certainly accept the resolution

If the Court were to announce a rule that

22

says, multistate corporations with diverse operations,

23

the principal place of business in that situation is the

24

headquarters, I think Your Honor is correct that

25

certainly we would prevail under that and that would be
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

entirely acceptable to us.

2

But -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, why would we say

3

that?

Just because it wins your case and it solves your

4

problem?

5

abandon your principal argument, which that -- which is

6

that "place" doesn't mean "State."

I mean, it seems to me, to do that, you

7

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Right.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And to talk about the whole

9

State of California as the principal place of doing

10

business -- I mean, if Congress meant that, it would

11

have said, the principal State in which business is

12

done.

13
14
15
16

MR. SRINIVASAN:

That's -- that's correct,

Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

You don't want to throw

away that good argument, do you?

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. SRINIVASAN:

We certainly don't want to

19

throw it away.

20

foremost, we would like to prevail.

21

under the narrow approach -

22

We certainly don't want -- first and

4

and foremost.

We

Let me just put that out there first

5

Now, with respect to -

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Were you done with

7

your -- were you done with your answer to Justice

8

Sotomayor's hypothetical?

9
10

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I don't know that I, in

fact, started the answer, Mr. Chief Justice -

11

(Laughter.)

12

MR. SRINIVASAN:

13

The answer is that even in that situation,

-- with respect.

14

for the reasons that Justice Scalia highlights, we would

15

say that the headquarters controls.

16

-- two principal reasons why.

17

And let me give two

The first is that even if the operations are

18

in one State and the headquarters are in a different

19

State, the headquarters still is where the direction and

20

control comes from.

21

the phrase "principal place of business" in that

22

situation would still direct attention to the

23

headquarters.

24
25

And I think the ordinary meaning of

And the dictionary definitions that we
identified in -- in our brief and every Federal and
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

State law that defines the term "principal place of

2

business" defines it at headquarters -- as headquarters,

3

without any exception for the hypothetical situation

4

that Your Honor posits.

5
6

But the other -

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
headquarters?

7

MR. SRINIVASAN:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9
10

So what constitutes

to live there?

I'm sorry?
How many executives have

What else has to exist there?

And then

what is the default rule if those things don't exist?

11

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Right.

Your Honor, I think

12

-- and that -- that is the sort of different set of

13

questions which is other ambiguities with respect to the

14

definition of a headquarters in certain situations.

15

Now, by and large, the headquarters is

16

relatively straightforward.

17

which are an easy place to look, and if you look at the

18

experience of the Seventh Circuit, which of course has

19

applied the headquarters approach across the board over

20

the course of several decades, I think we can see that

21

that test has been straightforward and it is simple in

22

application, in the main.

23

It's made in public filings

Now, that is not to say that there are not

24

issues about the definition of headquarters at the outer

25

perimeters.

There are.

And I think the place I would
10

1

look first and foremost is:

2

control for the corporation come from?

3

situs at which the headquarters would be found.

4

Where does direction and
That is the

And I would look also to what a corporation

5

itself identifies as headquarters in public filings.

7

Act, corporations have to report their headquarters in

annual reports.

reports for other reasons other than establishing

11

with an air of objectivity about them.

12

would look.

13

That's where I

Now, I would make this other point, though,

14

about the ambiguity that Your Honor points to with

15

respect to the definition of a headquarters.

16

that is not at all an ambiguity that only applies to our

17

test, because under Respondent's test and under the test

18

of every court of appeals, they take into account the

19

headquarters.

20

Now, we would think that that is

21

dispositive.

22

highly relevant, albeit not dispositive.

ambiguities -

Why are the other circuits resistant to the
solution that you are proposing.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, first in a situation

10

with a multistate corporation with dispersed operations,

11

as we point out in footnote 2 of our reply brief, I

12

think the courts of appeal are generally in agreement

13

that the headquarters would control in that situation.

14

Now, with respect to whether you would have

15

an across-the-board headquarters rule, Justice Ginsburg,

16

I think what happened is, the first court to consider

17

this question was the Third Circuit in the Scott case,

18

pretty soon after the statute was enacted in 1958.

19

that court, with respect, didn't wrestle with the

20

ordinary meaning of the statutory terms, and it didn't

21

wrestle with the strong premium on simple and

22

administrable jurisdictional rules.

23

doctrine sort of took on a life of its own, I think.

conflict.

25

what we explain in our brief.

Pre-1958, I think there was a

That's what the treatises said and that's
But there certainly were

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

some courts that adopted a headquarters approach, even

2

in the bankruptcy context.

3

But I think one thing I would caution the

4

Court about is assuming that just because some courts in

5

the bankruptcy context, because of bankruptcy-specific

6

considerations -- and a specific consideration was the

7

felt need to have the assets of the bankrupt estate

8

within the purview of the court so that the court could

9

administer the estate -- that Congress would have wanted

10

to import every judicial application down to every

11

nuanced detail in the bankruptcy context over to the

12

jurisdictional context, where we know that Congress

13

thought that simplicity was a real virtue.

14

And I think, as Your Honor's opinion in

15

Wachovia v. Schmidt a few terms ago points out, there is

16

no reason to assume that Congress would have taken one

17

word in the venue context and applied the exact same

18

meaning to that same word in the jurisdictional context.

19

And here, because of the strong preference -- excuse me

20

-- in favor of simplicity and administrability in

21

jurisdictional rules, that is a particularly poignant

22

reason why the headquarters approach, in our -- in our

23

point of view, should govern in all circumstances.

24

Now -

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In the case -- this is

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

purely hypothetical, but suppose Hertz were to be

2

bankrupt, file a petition in bankruptcy, where -- New

3

Jersey would be the place, on your -- or the assets are

4

dominantly someplace else, so it would be another place?

5

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I think, if -- if

6

what you are asking, Justice Ginsburg, is, where would

7

the principal place of business be under the bankruptcy

8

statute, the majority rule now, under the Fifth Circuit

9

case Commonwealth Oil Refining and the Seventh Circuit

10

case Peachtree, would show that the majority rule now is

11

that the principal place of business would be New

12

Jersey.

13

And one point I would like to get to in that

14

regard is the sort of oddity of saying that the -- the

15

principal place of business of a company like Hertz

16

would be somewhere other than New Jersey.

17

Circuit has a view that the principal place of business

18

of Hertz is California, based on the fact that Hertz

19

conducts 20 percent of its business in California.

20

The Ninth

But it is important to bear in mind that

21

this statute is a zero-sum game.

So that if Hertz is

22

deemed to have its principal place of business in

23

California, such that it is disabled from getting access

24

to diversity jurisdiction in California, the consequence

25

is that Hertz would be enabled to gain diversity
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

jurisdiction in every other State -- and I'm putting to

2

one side Delaware, the State of incorporation -- but it

3

would be enabled to gain access to -- to diversity

4

jurisdiction in every other State.

5

So the consequence would be that if Hertz

6

were sued in a State court action in Park Ridge, New

7

Jersey, the site of its headquarters, Hertz could get

8

Federal court jurisdiction in that jurisdiction on the

9

theory that it's an out-of-State company, it's a

10

California company, because it performs 20 percent of

11

its business in California.

12

Now that -- the oddity of that, in our view,

13

is particularly poignant if one takes into account a

14

company like Wal-Mart.

15

recognized to be an Arkansas corporation because it is

16

headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, but Wal-Mart

17

also, it's undisputed, does substantially more business

18

by any of the measures that the Ninth Circuit considers

19

significant in Texas.

20

has more stores there; it generates more revenues there,

21

by a significant factor well in excess of 50 percent

22

over and above any other State.

23

Wal-Mart is universally

It has more employees there; it

But the consequence of deeming Wal-Mart a

24

Texas corporation based on the amount of business it

25

does in Texas would be not only that Wal-Mart would be
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

disabled from getting Federal court jurisdiction in

2

Texas, but that Wal-Mart would be enabled to get Federal

3

court jurisdiction in Bentonville, Arkansas, on the

4

theory that even in Arkansas, Wal-Mart would be an

5

out-of-State corporation, a Texas corporation, because

6

of the level of business that it conducts in Texas.

7

And we don't think that is the result that

8

Congress would have envisioned in 1958 when it enacted

9

the Principal Place of Business provision.

Instead,

10

what Congress presumably had in mind is that

11

corporations, as a general matter, are identified with

12

the location of their headquarters.

13

So in the Wal-Mart situation, Wal-Mart

14

rightly is universally acknowledged to be an Arkansas

15

corporation because of the presence in that State of its

16

headquarters.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, all you are

18

talking about is not necessarily nerve center, because

19

in reading the examples in your brief, what you are

20

talking about is:

21

the most important, significant, influential contact?

22

Where is the place where they have

Now, the Ninth Circuit has defined that as

23

the place where business is done; you are suggesting

24

that it's the place where the nerve center is.

25

goes back to begging my question:

But it

Why -- just simply

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

their declaring it on a tax form doesn't make it

2

important, influential, or significant contact.

3

has to be something more to the test, and it can't be

4

just what I declare my headquarters to be.

5

be some form of activity in that place.

6

MR. SRINIVASAN:

There

There has to

There does, Your Honor, and

7

we think -- I guess the -- the comparison I would make

8

is to an individual, because an individual can't declare

9

that he or she is a domiciliary of a particular State

10

and have it be so for citizenship purposes.

11

to be something behind that, and so too with

12

corporations.

13
14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There has

That's -- that's the

point.

15

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Exactly, and we -- we share

16

that view.

17

its headquarters are located in a -- in a location where

18

it has a mailbox, for example, and have that be

19

dispositive for citizenship purposes.

20

A corporation couldn't simply declare that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What -

Is there -- is there

21

something to a rule that says headquarters is

22

presumptively the nerve center, but a challenged party,

23

whoever that is, can rebut it?

24
25

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I think certainly it would

be a vast improvement over what the Ninth Circuit has.
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

So I would say that as a starting point, Your Honor.

2

think -- in our view, of course, a principal submission

3

is the headquarters controls in all -- in all

4

situations, and the cost of having, you know, a

5

rebuttable presumption would be:

6

rebut it?

7

What does it take to

That would be question.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I

And I think-

Well, that's the point

8

that I raised, which is that the headquarters is not an

9

important, consequential, or substantial.

10
11

You can rebut

it if you can show that it is a shell headquarters.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

Yes.

And I think in that

12

situation, I guess -- I guess there is two different

13

ways that one could look at that.

14

you could rebut it, but the other is to say that it is

15

not the headquarters.

16

One is to say that

And I guess that's the way that I would look

17

at it, is to say that if the corporation identifies a

18

location at which it in fact doesn't direct and control

19

the operations of the corporation throughout, it

20

wouldn't constitute the headquarters.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, but -

So I guess that's where I

Right.

So that it's always a

rebuttable presumption.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

There is, Your Honor, and

if the other side were able to show that the location

that the party identifies as -- as its headquarters does

11

not, in fact, function as a headquarters, in the sense

12

that suppose there is no executives there, or suppose

13

that the officials that are there in fact don't direct

14

and control the company's operations in other locations.

15

Well, then, that -- that would be a real issue.

16

But there are checks against that, because

17

corporations identify their headquarters in other public

18

filings, and in the main, those headquarters are the

19

locations in -- from which the chief executives direct

20

and control the companies' operations -

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I actually do not know

22

whether public filings define what "headquarters" mean.

23

Is there a -- I know you have said it in your brief, but

24

what I didn't know is whether those public filings

25

define the activity necessary to designate a place as

"headquarters."

2

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, they -- they do in

3

the following sense, Your Honor.

For example, with the

4

10-K report for publicly traded companies, I think the

5

question that is asked is not the location of the

6

headquarters but the location of the principal executive

7

offices.

8

that question the principal executives would be located

9

at that -- at that location.

And so I think, by definition, in answering

Now, if they weren't, we

10

would certainly take Your Honor's point that there could

11

be a back-and-forth about that, but that -

And I was thinking, when you gave the

20

example of Texas, that the idea of diversity is you are

21

not going to get a Federal forum where you are at home.

22

And so one would think, well, if Wal-Mart is doing so

23

much in Texas, it's really no stranger in Texas.

24

shouldn't there be diversity in Texas?

25

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Why

Well, in -- in response to

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the latter point, Your Honor, I think the one thing we

2

do know from 1958 is that Congress didn't think that a

3

corporation should be disabled from getting diversity

4

jurisdiction anywhere where it does a substantial

5

business, because it had that proposal before it, and it

6

rejected it.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8

MR. SRINIVASAN:

9

It rejected it, yes.
It instead chose an

approach whereby a company is disabled from getting

10

diversity jurisdiction in one, and only one,

11

jurisdiction, the jurisdiction in which it has its

12

principal place of business.

13

And I think what Congress had in mind is

14

that corporations, as a general matter, are identified

15

with their headquarters.

16

example, is universally recognized as an Arkansas

17

variety of jurisdictions.

22

substantial business and is a well recognized company,

23

it should be disabled from getting to Federal court.

24

limited it to one jurisdiction.

25

And that is why Wal-Mart, for

It may be that Wal-Mart does substantial

But Congress decidedly didn't

And we think the best reading of the phrase
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

"principal place of business" is the situs of the

2

headquarters in that there were -- with -- with respect

3

to the bankruptcy decisions, Your Honor, there -- there

4

were bankruptcy courts that did have a "headquarters"

5

approach.

6

which I am aware that looked at the meaning of the

7

ordinary language -- we cite the -- the relevant -- the

8

portion of the court's opinion at page 50 of our opening

9

brief in footnote 5.

10

in the Burdick case.

11

And, in fact, the one bankruptcy court of

It is the First Circuit's opinion

And what the First Circuit said was that a

12

corporation's, quote, "principal office," rather than a

13

factory, mill or mine, according to ordinary

14

understanding and speech, constitutes the principal

15

place of business within the meaning of the Bankruptcy

16

Code."

17

And so even before 1958, I think there was

18

definitely a sense out there that the term "principal

19

place of business" does mean headquarters.

20

gets to Your Honor's other question which is:

21

Congress really meant "headquarters," why wouldn't they

22

have used the term "headquarters" instead of "principal

23

place of business"?

24
25

And this
If

And I think our answer to that, with respect
to Your Honor, is that "principal place of business" is
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

an alternative formulation for "headquarters."

2

don't think one can glean too much from the fact that

3

Congress chose "principal place of business" rather than

4

"headquarters" when "principal place of business" in our

5

view is a reference to the headquarters.

6

And so I

And this Court's opinion last term in the

7

Oswell Harlow versus United States case is a good

8

example of that, because there the statute that was at

9

issue used the term "facilitate" rather than the term

10

"aid or abet."

11

argument that because the statute uses the term

12

"facilitate" rather than "aid or abet," that normal

13

principles that accompany aiding and abetting liability

14

shouldn't apply in the statute.

15

in our view reached the contrary conclusion, and it was

16

based on the notion that the term "facilitate,"

17

according to Black's Law Dictionary, means the very same

18

thing as "aid or abet."

19

then you can apply aiding or abetting principles to the

20

term "facilitate."

21

And one could have readily made the

But the Court rightly

And once you cross that bridge,

That's how Black's Law Dictionary

speaks too loudly to the question of JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about her argument

3

that -- that Hertz has this New Jersey headquarters, but

4

its reservation center is in Oklahoma?

5

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Sure, and -- and, again, I

6

would look at the public filings.

7

in the 10-K, for example, Hertz universally identifies

8

its headquarters as Park Ridge, New Jersey.

9

reason is that the chief executive officials are all

Now, there is a large administrative

This Court comes -- this case comes to the

Now, if I could -- if I could turn for one

12

moment to the cost in terms of simplicity and

13

demonstrability of an alternative formulation if the

14

Court were to accommodate a formulation that didn't look

15

to the headquarters, we see three potential categories

16

of costs that are brought about by the -- the proposed

approach of Respondents in what the Ninth Circuit has

established.

19

The first is the one that underlies the

strong preference in favor of simple, demonstrable,

jurisdictional rules.

resources that would be invested at the threshold

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Not all diversity suits

spend in -- in discovery to determine more complex

4

tests.

5

MR. SRINIVASAN:

That's right.

Yes, that's

6

our point, Justice Kennedy, and I think a "headquarters"

7

test is simple and straightforward in that respect, and

8

a "totality of circumstances" approach isn't.

9

is also two additional costs that I would point out

10
11

But there

about a "totality of circumstances" approach.
One is that you can have the very real

12

possibility because of the indeterminacy in that

13

approach that different courts would reach divergent

14

conclusions about the citizenship of the very same

altogether surprising that you would have those sorts of

17

was using a term of art that was imported from the

18

Bankruptcy Code.

19

The first answer is that Congress

In all of the Bankruptcy Code cases prior to

20

1958, the 11 USC 11 cases take an aggregation approach

21

when they look at it State-by-State, so, if we raise

22

principal place of business as a term of art that

23

Congress imported into this statute, then we have to

24

look at an aggregated State-by-State approach.

25

The other answer, I think, is more of a
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

semantic answer, which is how did Congress define the

2

word "place"?

3

that a place can be a building, as Hertz would have, or

4

a place could be a State, as we -- my place of birth,

5

for example, is New York State.

6

Certainly, the English language provides

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

say place of doing business?

8

that they used.

9
10
11

MR. SCHNEIDER:

Why -- why didn't they
That's not the terminology

They didn't, and Congress

was JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That would be more

12

consistent with an aggregation of -- of all of the

13

factors the Ninth Circuit starts with.

14

MR. SCHNEIDER:

Your Honor, Congress chose

15

the phrase "principal place of business" because, to

16

quote the legislative history, there were many cases on

17

the books, and it was an easily understood phrase.

18

I think what Congress intended to do was to

19

not have us end up here, to take a phrase which was

20

known in the case law and to import it -

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, what's very

22

clear from all of the articles I have read in the lower

23

court decisions is that Congress may have thought it was

24

picking a well-defined phrase, but, in fact, it wasn't,

25

that the Courts below are confused about what they were
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

doing before the statute.

2

So I don't know why importing the belief

3

that something was clear into a reality that it's not

4

helps us.

5

MR. SCHNEIDER:

Your Honor, in answer to

6

Justice Scalia's question, I believe it was clear, from

7

all of the case law, that we were talking about place

8

equalling an aggregation of all of the activity in the

9

State.

10

With regard to your question, we have cited

11

in our brief two district court opinions that performed

12

a scholarly review of all of the case law at the time

13

that Congress passed the 1958 amendments.

14

of import is the Inland Rubber case.

15

Particularly

And what the court found in the Inland

16

Rubber case is, while there was two lines of thinking,

17

there was the -- what came to be known as the nerve

18

center line of thinking and what came to be known as the

19

business reality line of thinking.

20

The nerve center test could almost all be

21

explained by the fact that, in those cases, the

22

corporation only had one place of business, there were

23

some outliers, but for the most part, the two judges, in

24

the Gilardi case and in the Inland Rubber case -

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why do you -- why do

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you think that the circuits courts -- the vast majority

2

of them, the third, the first, the second, the fifth,

3

they all start with the proposition that, if a place has

4

far-flung businesses, then the nerve center test should

5

start the inquiry and control it more than in a

6

situation where there are lesser places of business?

7

MR. SCHNEIDER:

Yes.

That's the total

8

activities test, Your Honor, and the total activities

9

test would put initial weight on the nerve center, but

10

if one -- and then, of course, weigh whether or not

11

there is a substantial predominance of all of -- of all

12

of the other factors somewhere in the country, which,

13

frankly, is not a lot different than the Ninth Circuit

14

case -- test.

15
16

The Ninth Circuit simply does it in the
other way.

It asks -

17
18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that's a big

difference.

19

MR. SCHNEIDER:

It asks the same question,

20

whether or not there is a -- a substantial

21

predominance -- finds substantial predominance, not just

22

predominance, but substantial predominance.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- you know, to me,

24

the word "substantial" usually means closer to 50

25

percent.

I'm having a hard time understanding what the
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

appreciable difference is between 20 percent and 14 and

2

the balance being spread over so many other places.

3

What -- that seems very arbitrary in terms

4

of the place that generates the most money.

5

That's the place you are at home.

6

MR. SCHNEIDER:

That's it.

I think, to understand it,

7

one must look at the purpose of diversity.

The real

8

question is, is diversity to be used as a sword by a

9

corporation, such that a corporation can choose its

10

place of diversity jurisdiction, or is it a shield to

11

protect the corporation, a truly foreign corporation,

12

from local bias?

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, but that's what -

14

but that goes back to the point, if we are talking about

15

shields or swords, Congress had before it a provision

16

that would say, anywhere you do business, you are not a

17

foreigner, because you are there.

18

to perceive you as a business -- the local business that

19

is doing business in that location, and Congress

20

rejected that.

21

The people are going

So foreign has to have a meaning that was

22

somewhat different.

And you don't think the corporate

23

headquarters where management is, where the direction

24

for the operation of the business is coming from, is the

25

place that needs the most protection in this system
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

because they are the ones making the decisions, and so

2

aren't they the ones who need to be protected from local

3

bias?

4

MR. SCHNEIDER:

Courts have found that

5

corporations are best known where they have most of

6

their people and their property.

7

employees go out in the community, property is bought

8

and sold in the community, so the local people will know

9

the corporation more where they have their people and

That's because

10

property than, necessarily, where they have the

11

headquarters.

12

Until this case began, I had no idea where

13

Hertz headquarters are.

There is many corporations in

14

the State of California, that I have no idea are

15

headquartered in the State of California.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The problem with your -

17

your approach -- and California is unique in this

18

respect, is -- California is a very large State, lots of

19

business, and you are comparing to the next State that

20

has the next number of employees -- you know, Florida.

21

If I were entertaining your approach, I

22

would think, well, you would compare California against

23

the whole rest of the nation and not pick for a

24

dispersed -- a corporation that is widely dispersed.

25

California is going to be the big winner in
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

this.

2

its State court because so many multi-State

3

corporations, I imagine, would come out, just the way

4

Hertz does.

5

It's going to be able to keep all those cases in

Am I right, that, under your analysis, the

6

one place where, if you say, we don't want Federal

7

courts to be dealing with corporations that are at home

8

in the State, but in the State of New Jersey, under your

9

view of things, a New Jersey citizen could sue Hertz in

10
11

Federal court in New Jersey, right?
MR. SCHNEIDER:

That is correct, Your Honor,

12

unless, of course, Hertz were to change its place of

13

incorporation to New Jersey.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And why do you say,

15

well -- why is it that the Ninth Circuit's method,

16

California versus Florida, instead of California and

17

let's see what the rest of the business is -- is, in the

18

whole United States?

19

MR. SCHNEIDER:

I think the answer, Justice

20

Ginsburg, to that question goes back to how the phrase

21

"principal place of business" was looked at under the

22

Bankruptcy Code, and in the Bankruptcy Code, it was, in

23

fact, a State-by-State analysis, rather than a State

24

versus country analysis.

25

Now, Justice Ginsburg, you asked me, did it
36

mean that all corporations were going to end up being

California corporations?

3

some balancing test for 50 years, and it has not come to

pass that all corporations are California corporations.

13

A -- a corporation that sells mining

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't understand why,

14

somehow, a Californian is more likely to identify with

15

Hertz, simply because there are more Californians and,

16

hence, more Hertz outlets, than a New Jerseyite is

17

likely to identify with Hertz.

18

Per capita, there are probably as many Hertz

19

outlets in New Jersey as there are in California.

enormous State.

therefore, the unfairness of -- of letting that

and California are absolutely the same.

2

MR. SCHNEIDER:

Congress made a decision in

3

rejecting the any place where you are doing business

4

test, that it would not prevent corporations from

5

removing cases in any State where they are doing

6

business.

7

The question in diversity jurisdiction is

8

not whether or not a corporation should be allowed to

9

use the Federal forum to decide if that's the best forum

10

for it, but the question is a different one.

11

be bias in the -- in the State court?

12

Will there

And because Hertz does so much business in

13

California, it's hard to argue that we bias by being in

14

the State court in California.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Remember, this case But they cannot be

16

advised by the State court in New Jersey either.

17

you correctly pointed out that Congress said place of

18

business.

19

do as it did with -- with corporate citizenship, that is

20

you could be a citizenship of as many States as you

21

incorporate in.

22

not just keep it simple and say presumptively it's the

23

business headquarters, in a particular case you could

24

show otherwise.

25

The -

It didn't even do as it did with -- it didn't

But if it's got to be one place, so why

MR. SCHNEIDER:

Congress had two goals,
38

Alderson Reporting Company

Justice Ginsburg.

2

of the system.

3

easily -

4

The first goal was to prevent gaming

The simplest test is also the most

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that would be a phony

5

headquarters.

6

headquarters of Hertz in New Jersey, that that's a sham

7

set-up.

8
9

But nobody is suggesting that -- that the

MR. SCHNEIDER:

But even a -- even a real

headquarters wouldn't prevent gaming of the system.

10

If -- if a corporation truly wanted to stay out of State

11

court in a State where it was doing significant

12

business, even all of their business under Hertz' test,

13

they would only have to actually move their headquarters

14

out of that State.

15
16
17

There is a second reason that Congress
passed the '58 amendment JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is that phenomenon?

I

18

mean, I can see that as a hypothetical, but does it

19

happen in the real world, that a corporation moves its

20

headquarters in order to escape the Federal courts in a

21

particular State?

22

MR. SCHNEIDER:

Because the test is only a

23

Seventh Circuit test, it wouldn't do any good for a

24

corporation -

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it is one of the

39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

factors in other -- in other states as well.

2

of the totality of the circumstances.

3

increase your odds to move your headquarters.

4

MR. SCHNEIDER:
dispositive.

6

sorts of economic reasons.

7

they move because -

9
10

You certainly

It would, but it wouldn't be

5

8

It's part

We do know that corporations move for all
They move for tax reasons,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But why would they move

simply to avoid a Federal court or to gain access to the
Federal court in a particular State?

11

MR. SCHNEIDER:

There is -- as witnessed by

12

congressional findings in the Class Action Fairness Act,

13

there is a perception that State courts in certain

14

States are not good for corporations.

15

that perception is a real perception or whether it's not

16

a real perception isn't before us today.

17

Whether that -

But if a corporation has all of its people

18

and all of its property and is doing all of its business

19

in one of those States, the corporation shouldn't be

20

allowed to game the system by simply moving its

21

headquarters, it's real headquarters out of that State.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But we are not talking

23

about all.

I mean, that would be -- that's why you make

24

it a presumption, the headquarters is a presumption

25

which could be rebutted.

But you are not talking about
40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

all business.

2

there is a sizeable amount of business, simply because

3

it's the size of the State, the population of the State.

4

You are talking about California where

And I would understand your position better

5

if you would say, well, we would measure against the

6

entirety of the United States.

7

to come out the winner much more often than any other

8

State under this test simply because of its size.

9

MR. SCHNEIDER:

But California is going

With respect, Justice

10

Ginsburg, I don't believe that the case law has borne

11

that out.

12

corporations are more often California citizens simply

13

because of the population of California -- that doesn't

14

mean that the study hasn't exist -- doesn't exist.

15

simply haven't read it.

16

Again, I have read no studies that say

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I

We don't worry about

17

private individuals gaming the system, do we, by -- you

18

know, in -- in order to get into or out of Federal

19

court, establishing residence in a different State?

20

don't worry about them gaming the system, do we?

21

MR. SCHNEIDER:

We do, Justice Scalia.

22

There is a fact-intensive test for citizenship for

23

individuals based on their intent to stay in a place.

24
25

We

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Sure.

But -- but you can

have a genuine intent to go somewhere else, and I don't
41
Alderson Reporting Company

1

know that people do it for foreign reasons because they

2

want to get in or out of Federal court.

3

don't worry about that, it seems to me.

4

MR. SCHNEIDER:

You really

I do believe it is less

5

likely that an individual would either have the

6

sophistication or, frankly, the litigation volume to

7

make such a decision?

8
9

But a corporation may, in fact.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I know some rich

individuals that might have the incentive.

10

MR. SCHNEIDER:

I would like to turn, if I

11

may, to the second reason that Congress passed the '58

12

amendment and that was because of the notion of

13

overcrowding of the Federal docket because too many

14

diversity cases -- because there were too many diversity

15

cases because most litigation was happening far away

16

from the facts.

17

Suits involving corporations generally arise

18

where they have a lot of contacts with the public, where

19

there people are and where their property are.

20

allow a corporation to move all of its litigation where

21

the bulk of its people and property are to Federal

22

court, Congress's second goal -

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

24

inject this thought?

25

question.

If we

Mr. Schneider, can I just

It goes back to Justice Kennedy's

I don't think we are concerned about the
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

defendants gaming the system.

2

important concern is plaintiffs sometimes in small

3

communities want to sue somebody, and sometimes they

4

would much rather be in Federal court, because sometimes

5

the judges are better than the local judges, and so

6

forth.

7

want to get into Federal courts.

8
9

I think one other very

So there are a lot of reasons why plaintiffs

And it seems to me it's important to have a
rule that makes it easy for the plaintiff to decide what

10

is the citizenship of the defendant, can I get into

11

Federal court or not.

12

in favor of a very simple rule to benefit plaintiffs.

13

And I see it as a great argument

MR. SCHNEIDER:

The -- again, for 50 years,

14

Justice Stevens, plaintiffs and plaintiffs' lawyers have

15

been able to under the various tests figure out where

16

corporations are citizens.

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But you must acknowledge

18

that it's a lot easier for a plaintiff -- there is some

19

place to get on the internet and say where is their

20

principal place and they get a simple answer.

21

get a question, well, I got to analyze their business

22

all over the country to decide, that's a formidable

23

obstacle for a -- for a plaintiff to overcome.

24
25

MR. SCHNEIDER:

If you

It may or may not be,

depending upon the corporation.

The vast majority of

43

corporations are local corporations, so we are really

just talking about -

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- of an interstate

4

business who are commonly defendants in a lot of

5

lawsuits -- in a personal injury suit, and the question

6

is, can I easily decide what the place of incorporation

7

of that defendant is.

8
9

MR. SCHNEIDER:
Stevens.

That's correct, Justice

And because most of those entities are public

10

corporations, there is a lot of information available in

11

FCC filings, et cetera, as to where they are actually

12

doing business.

13

and figure out whether have I seen a lot of Hertz

The idea that corporations would switch

fundamental reason why.
