ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

We will hear

MR. FISHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

A habeas petition challenging a new State

11

court judgment for the first time cannot be a second or

12

successive petition.

13

complex statutory system that has many interdependent

14

parts.

15

is reproduced at page 2 of the blue brief, of

16

Petitioner's brief.

AEDPA, of course, is a highly

The pivotal language of this case, section 2244,

17

What that section does is it restricts

18

claims that can be brought in, quote, "a second or

19

successive habeas corpus application" under section

20

2254.

21

First, the court needs to decide whether it's dealing

22

with a second or successive petition.

23

is and only if it is, then the Court applies the

24

modified res judicata principles set forth in that

25

section.

So this text establishes a two-step framework.

3
Alderson Reporting Company

And second, if it

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Now, this case involves only the first of

2

those two steps.

3

challenges a new death sentence cannot be a second or

4

successive petition for the very simple reason that it

5

challenges a State court judgment that has no -- never

6

been covered in a habeas petition before.

7

And a petition, as here, that

JUSTICE ALITO:

2244 doesn't make any

8

reference to judgment, 2244(b).

And now you bring in

9

the concept of a judgment by looking at another

10

provision.

11

means a second or successive application with respect to

12

a particular judgment, then I don't see why the

13

important and seemingly common sense point that you make

14

in footnote 8 of your brief can be correct; namely, that

15

when a prisoner such as Petitioner obtains habeas relief

16

from his sentence but not his conviction, any habeas

17

petition after his resentencing that challenged his

18

conviction would be successive.

19

But if "second or successive application"

You suggest that there are two judgments;

20

there is a judgment of sentence and there is a judgment

21

of conviction.

22

that is relevant is the judgment pursuant to which the

23

Petitioner is held in custody.

24

judgment -- that is the sentence.

25

But for habeas purposes, the only thing

And that is the

So I -- I -- if your argument is correct

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that you look to whether there's a second or successive

2

application as to a judgment, then the point you make in

3

footnote 8 just cannot be true.

4

gets sentencing relief, gets resentenced, in the second

5

petition the Petitioner can challenge the conviction.
MR. FISHER:

6

So that if Petitioner

But, Justice Alito, let me make

7

clear how we get to incorporating judgment and then

8

answer your question.

9

word "judgment" is because, again, the language I just

The way that you incorporate the

10

quoted says "an application under section 2244."

11

section 2244 defines -- and this is at the bottom of the

12

page, of page 2 -­

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

14

MR. FISHER:

15

relief from a State court judgment."

And

I understand that.

-- defines it as "seeking

16

Now, you are right that -- that -- that if

17

somebody receives relief only as to their sentence and

18

gets a new death sentence, as in this case, that the

19

judgment he is challenging is new only as to the

20

sentence.

21

Now, there -- the word "judgment" appears in

22

other places in the U.S. Code.

There is two other

23

places I am aware of where this Court had to construe

24

the word "judgment."

25

with respect to this Court's jurisdiction over final

One of them is when this -- is

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

State court judgments.

And in that realm -- this is in

2

Brady v. Maryland in footnote 1 it's laid out.

3

realm, this Court treats the judgment as having two

4

parts that can be final -­

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

In that

Well, if a -- if someone has

6

a -- a judgment of conviction, but is no longer in

7

custody, that -- that person cannot bring habeas

8

petition, isn't that right?

9

MR. FISHER:

10

That's right.

JUSTICE ALITO:

So it -- it is the judgment

11

pursuant to which the person then is held in custody to

12

which the habeas petition goes.
MR. FISHER:

13

That's right.

And in Burton

14

this Court made it very clear that the judgment that

15

he's being held in custody as to is the new judgment

16

that he is challenging.

17

Now, what I'm saying is in the Brady context

18

this Court has treated judgment as having two parts that

19

can be final as to one and not as to the other.

20

other contexts in Burton, for purposes of seeking an

21

appeal or seeking habeas relief, it is treated as

22

inseparable.

23

In

And the common thread between those two

24

circumstances has been what minimizes Federal intrusion

25

on State affairs?

And so in this context that's a very

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

easy answer, because what this Court always assumed, and

2

correctly so, I believe, is that if the only thing that

3

is unconstitutional is somebody's sentence, that's the

4

only thing a Federal court has the power to invalidate.

5

And that's the only thing -­

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if the sentence

7

is -- he is convicted, sentenced to 10 years, and raises

8

an argument, and only an argument, that cuts off 2 years

9

of his sentence.

He says under the statute the maximum

10

is 8 years, and the court says, the judgment is vacated

11

to the extent it goes beyond 8 years.

12

Can he then bring a new challenge to, say,

13

the whole sentence, or cut it off at 4 years, or does

14

that limit his challenge?

15

get to the point that it's not just the conviction, but

16

if it's a period of the sentence that is not subject to

17

challenge the first time?

18

MR. FISHER:

In other words, I'm trying to

Well, I don't know,

19

Mr. Chief Justice, that that question could actually

20

arise in a section 2254 case, where the only thing a

21

Federal court has power to do is to declare one way or

22

the other whether the sentence is constitutional or not

23

and then leave it to the State to decide in further

24

proceedings how to -- how to go forward.

25

In the Federal context in section 2255, the

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

question you suggest might arise, and indeed it has in a

2

few places.

3

have asked themselves in the second habeas petition, the

4

second in time habeas petition, is the -- is the

5

Petitioner challenging something he lost on the first

6

time?

7

successive petition.

And if the answer to that is yes, then it's a

8
9

And the question that the Federal courts

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I don't want to

belabor -­

10

MR. FISHER:

If he's challenging -­

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

I don't want to belabor this

12

point, but once you get beyond the formal argument that

13

you just look to whether it's a new judgment -- if you

14

-- if you take a step beyond that, and if you -- if you

15

don't take a step beyond that, then footnote 8 is wrong.
If you take a step beyond that, then

16
17

there -- then there isn't a textual basis for drawing

18

this distinction between the sentence and the

19

conviction.

20

consistent with the scheme of that; isn't that right?

21

And what you need to ask is what is

MR. FISHER:

No, Justice Alito.

I think

22

there are two textual bases.

The first is the word

23

"judgment" and, as I've described, sometimes this Court

24

treats the judgment as having two parts that can be

25

divided, and sometimes it doesn't.

8
Alderson Reporting Company

I think in this

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

context it ought to treat them as able to be divided.

2

The other place you look is the words "second" -­

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

Before you get

4

beyond that, what you are talking about here is the

5

judgment under which he is being held in custody, right?

6

MR. FISHER:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

divide it, that judgment hasn't changed.

9

MR. FISHER:

10

Correct.
And that -- even if you

Well, certainly it has -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

He is still -- even -- his

11

sentence has been altered and it's sent back for

12

resentencing, but he is still being held in custody

13

under the same judgment.
MR. FISHER:

14

He is being held in custody

15

until he is executed, certainly, under his conviction.

16

But his death sentence -- and in habeas -- in habeas

17

it's always been understood you can challenge not just

18

the fact of your custody, but the terms under which your

19

custody -­

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

MR. FISHER:

That's true.

But -­

So I think the death sentence

22

here is most easily thought of as the terms of the

23

custody, which is a separate thing that he challenged

24

and won on the first time and is challenging again now.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I -- I'm not sure.

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And getting back to Justice Alito's point, if -- if we

2

say that the conviction is separate from the sentence,

3

he can't challenge the conviction without being -­

4

meeting the successive bar, what about the finding of

5

death eligibility?

6

from the sentence just like the earlier conviction?

7

Why -- why can't that be separated

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think that because -­

8

what we're we are really talking about here when we talk

9

about death eligibility is the need to find an

10

aggravating circumstance.

And here that goes only to

11

whether -- his penalty, what his penalty can be.

12

only to whether he can receive the death sentence or

13

not.

So it goes solely to punishment, not to crime.

14

Now, Justice Alito, on -­

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16
17

It's

That followed from the

first conviction.
MR. FISHER:

The first conviction enabled

18

him -- if we put aside for the moment our substantive

19

fight over whether or not the crime itself constitutes

20

an aggravating circumstance, but the conviction itself

21

carries a life sentence unless an aggravating

22

circumstance is found.

23

And so put -- put it this way,

24

Justice Kennedy:

25

habeas relief the first time, Mr. Magwood at that

After the Eleventh Circuit granted

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

moment, in 1986, was subject to a conviction that

2

carried a life sentence.

3

elected to go forward at that point and to seek a new

4

death sentence.

5

that brandnew full-blown sentencing hearing was held -­

6

and the Alabama trial court at Pet App. 103a called this

7

a "complete and new assessment of the evidence and the

8

law" -- when this new hearing was held it had to comport

9

with the Constitution.

10

And it was the State that

And all our position is, is that when

I don't think even the State disputes that

11

all the -- all parts of the Constitution applied in that

12

context.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

MR. FISHER:

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Fisher -­

And so -­
-- you -- you say -- you

16

present this argument that it is a second petition and

17

you say that's the only issue before us and there is no

18

other way that the new proceeding would be cut off under

19

AEDPA.

20

There was in this case, in the first -- when

21

the -- the sentence was set -- set aside, an order by

22

the district judge; and it said:

23

now to bring out all conceivable -- all conceivable

24

claims on pain of forfeiture.

25

Magwood, I want you

Why doesn't that alone -- this is an order

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

by the court:

2

litigation; I want you to bring forward all conceivable

3

claims.

4

of forfeiture.

5

I don't want you to engage in seriatim

And that was an order and it was made on pain
Why isn't that dispositive of this case?

MR. FISHER:

Because that order was entered

6

in one case, and now we have an entirely different case,

7

Justice Ginsburg.

8

under which Mr. Magwood challenged his 1981 judgment.

9

That order was entered in the case

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but what he's

10

bringing up now was a conceivable claim that he could

11

have brought up then.
MR. FISHER:

12

Well, it's not -- it was not

13

claim he could have brought, and this is an important

14

point, Justice Ginsburg.

15

not making, as the State would say, the same claim now

16

as he could have made then.

17

challenging a different judgment by definition makes it

18

a new -­

Under res judicata law, he is

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

The fact that he is

But the issue is the

20

same.

21

penalty because at the time he committed this offense,

22

there had to be, in addition to the eligible offense, at

23

least one aggravator.

24
25

The issue is that he didn't qualify for the death

MR. FISHER:

That's right.

The legal -- the

legal issue that he is raising is one that he could have

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

raised then.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So why doesn't preclusion

3

result from the court's order that says:

4

conceivable claims?

5

MR. FISHER:

Bring up all

Because you can't waive

6

something by failing to raise it in a different case.

7

This is an entirely different case, in the district

8

court -­

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then -- then you get to -­

10

you get to Justice Alito's question, because in fact

11

what we have here is we have piece of paper issued in

12

1981, and on that piece of paper it says:

13

Joe Magwood, are guilty and sentenced to death by

14

electrocution.

15

which was issued in 1986, and that says:

16

ordered and adjudged guilty of the offense of aggravated

17

murder and sentenced to death by electrocution.

18

words are identical.

19

was issued in '86.

20

You, Billy

Then we have another piece of paper
You are

So the

And one was issued in '81 and one

So you are saying since '86 -- this piece of

21

paper in '86 is a new judgment, you can start all over.

22

So then the question comes up, well, if you can start

23

all over in respect to anything, why can't you start all

24

over in respect to everything?

25

that would be a mess, because all the things that were

But you recognize that

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

never challenged here, like those things related to

2

guilt, they could all come up again, too, even though he

3

has never done it.

4

So what is -- what is -- what is your

5

answer?

6

things if it wasn't at issue you can bring up, and

7

others you can't; and once you are down that track, how

8

do we know whether these are on one side or the other?

9

Clearly you are going to start saying some

MR. FISHER:

So let me answer that in

10

practical terms and then get back to Justice Alito by

11

giving a -- giving statutory hook for it.

12

In practical terms, even though the new

13

judgment, which is at Pet. App. 106a, reimposes the

14

conviction, it's not anything new as to that conviction.

15

If it were a new judgment as to that conviction, the

16

State of Alabama would have to have a whole new trial on

17

guilt/innocence, and it didn't.

18
19

JUSTICE BREYER:
respect to the sentence.

20

MR. FISHER:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22
23
24
25

It is something new in

Pardon me?
It is something new in

respect to the sentence.
MR. FISHER:

It is new because of the

brandnew sentence, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Ah!

But it is not new in

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

respect to the words.

They are identical.

MR. FISHER:

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

MR. FISHER:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

reimposed.

7

Well, it's -­
All that happened -­

-- they imposed -­
-- is the sentence was

So why not those things?
Does your concession on the first part,

8

which I agree is necessary, imply a concession on the

9

second part, that it's not new in respect to what might

10

have been brought up before?
MR. FISHER:

11

No, it doesn't.

Look at this

12

Court's decision in Lawlor.

13

opening brief, I believe around page 23, and it's a res

14

judicata case.

15

if somebody does something to somebody, the exact same

16

thing multiple times, you can bring a new case when they

17

do it to you the second time or the third time, and you

18

can make arguments that were never made the first time.

19

There is no waiver, there is no forfeiture, and the

20

reason you can do it is you are challenging a new

21

injury.

22

This is discussed in our

And what the Court held in that case is

So Mr. Magwood under -- even under res

23

judicata law, which this Court has said is stricter than

24

habeas law, even under res judicata law he would have

25

the right to bring this claim as to the sentence because

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it's challenging something new.

2

Now let me get back to the statute, because

3

this is important.

4

our answer is the word -­

5

The other place that we get our -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

The reason

6

Lawlor doesn't work is what you have there is different

7

acts.

8

judgment with respect to the same act.

9

judgment with -- with respect to a different act.

The later judgment is -- is not just a later
It's a later
Here

10

you are saying you want to apply the same rule with

11

respect to a later judgment, redoing the judgment for

12

the same prior act.

13

rule has to apply.

14

And I don't think that the same

MR. FISHER:

With all due respect, I think

15

Lawlor does apply.

One example in that case is an

16

abatable nuisance.

Imagine that smoke goes over and

17

pollutes somebody's property every -- every first day of

18

January every year.

19

that saying it violates certain laws, and they lose.

20

the next year smoke goes over the property again, you

21

can bring a lawsuit for the identical thing.

22

Somebody brings a lawsuit about

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Not the identical thing.

23

The last one was for the smoke that went last year.

24

next one is for the smoke that went this year.

25

MR. FISHER:

If

Fair enough.

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Well, same -­

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

same here.

2

the 1981 judgment sentencing him to death, and this case

3

is about the 1986.

4
5

The first case Mr. Magwood brought was about

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm

talking about the act that is the basis of the lawsuit.

6

MR. FISHER:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

MR. FISHER:

9

The same act of his.

here is not the same act.

But remember, the act -­
It's the very same act.

But all we are talking about
The same act as to the

10

conviction carries over, but this was, as the trial

11

court put it, a complete and new assessment of the

12

evidence.

This second -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

13

Well, I -- I -- I want you

14

to get -- on the assessment of the evidence, I just want

15

to ask -- I probably should know this, and you can get

16

back to Justice Alito's question as well.

17

procedure, at the sentencing hearing both in the first

18

trial and the second, is there evidence about the

19

aggravating and mitigating, or do you just look at the

20

evidence that was proven in the guilt phase?

21

MR. FISHER:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

23
24
25

Under Alabama

Well, the trial judge -­
Is there new witnesses,

et cetera?
MR. FISHER:

As it turns out, the parties

did not put new witnesses on the stand.

17
Alderson Reporting Company

But the trial

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

judge was explicit -- and this is in the -- in the order

2

that's in the back of the appendix -- it was explicit

3

that the parties had the right to do that.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

MR. FISHER:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7
8
9

But then it's -­

They had every right -­
-- not clear to me why

death eligibility wasn't a part of the first conviction.
MR. FISHER:

Because death eligibility

hinges on the finding of an aggravating circumstance.

10

And so that was vacated when the -- when the -- when the

11

State elected to go forward and tried to reimpose a

12

death sentence and the -- reimpose a new death sentence

13

and the trial judge found new -- it turned out to be the

14

same aggravating circumstance, but it found an

15

aggravating circumstance all over again.

16

Imagine, Justice Kennedy, the State if it

17

had wanted to at the second death sentence hearing could

18

have submitted evidence to try to prove a new

19

aggravating circumstance.

20

submitted evidence trying to prove new mitigating

21

circumstances.

22

The defendants could have

Now, Mr. -- Justice Alito, I think it's

23

important to get back to your question for the second

24

actual hook for my argument, and it's the words "second

25

or successive."

It has to -- in some way to make any

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

sense of the statute, you have to say it's second or

2

successive as to something.

3

Now, if you look at McCleskey, which is this

4

Court's most thorough consideration of that concept, it

5

says again and again in that decision what makes it

6

second or successive is that you are asking for the same

7

thing you have been denied before.

8

as -- as -- as it used to be the case, you are filing,

9

in effect, an appeal, endless appeals from the denials

10

You are coming back,

that you have been getting.
We are giving meaning to "second or

11
12

successive" by saying that it's second or successive if

13

you are asking for relief that has been denied before.

14

It is not second or successive if it's the first time

you are challenging something new that the State's

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Fisher -- Mr. Fisher,

But

19

thinking in terms of what AEDPA was attempting to do, we

20

have two claims, one after the other.

21

is one that would take away the death penalty forever,

22

that would be it, because he said the only sentence I

23

can get is life without parole.

The second claim

penalty.

2

had brought the first claim and he is right about that,

3

he's not death eligible.

4

that still leaves him death eligible, and the court has

5

been burdened twice, when easily he could have brought,

6

as the district judge instructed him to do, everything

7

the first time.

So the court has been put upon twice.

MR. FISHER:

Justice Ginsburg, I'm going to

First of all, with -- with respect

10

to the two different claims, given the severity of

11

Mr. Magwood's mental illness, I think there was every

12

reason to expect that prevailing on that claim in the

13

Eleventh Circuit would have put an end to the State's

14

decision to seek the death penalty in this case.

15
16
17

As it turns out, it didn't and the State
went forward.
But also understand that the State's

18

argument here, to the extent you are ordering the claims

19

in sort of a level of importance, would apply even if

20

the opposite were true, even if Mr. Magwood had brought

the -- had brought some other claim the first time and

22

prevailed on it.

Any claim, the State says, that you

2

continue that.
We are giving meaning to that term "second

3

or successive."

4

whatever slight difficulty you have with the word

5

"judgment" and making sense of the words "second or

6

successive" in our case are dwarfed by the interpretive

7

difficulties, in fact the impossibilities, with respect

8

to the State's proposal.

9

It's important to understand that,

The State's proposal -- and it's laid out at

10

page 17 of its brief, at the top of the page, right

11

after the number 1 -- the State's proposed rule -- and I

12

think it's useful to put it next to the statute.

13

State's proposed rule is if a claim could have been or

14

was raised in a prior petition, it is barred by Section

15

2244 (2) or (1).

16

The

Now, the first thing you will notice is that

17

the words "second or successive" appear nowhere in the

19

whatsoever, to those concepts.

20

to do is -- is ask this Court to create a brandnew

21

waiver system, a brandnew waiver system for all second

22

in time petitions.

23

The State gives no definition, no meaning
What the State is trying

And we know -- we know from

24

Martinez-Villareal and Slack and other cases that second

25

in time petitions are not necessarily successive and

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

certainly they ought not to be thought of as successive

2

when they challenge a different judgment or a different

3

conviction or the like.

4

But what the State is asking for is a

5

brandnew waiver system that has never been imposed in

6

any decision from this Court and there have been three

7

decisions from this Court where it would have come up.

8

One is Burton, another is Richmond, which is cited in

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, how -- how does the

11

State's definition at page 17 of the red brief not

12

comport with the whole idea of second or successive?

13

MR. FISHER:

Because the only way to get the

14

idea of second or successive into the State's definition

15

is where it says prior habeas petition.

16

way that a State can even be pretending to give meaning

17

to that would be a second in time petition.

18

So, the only

Now, we know that can't be enough because of

19

Slack and Martinez-Villareal.

But even more than that,

20

we know that can't be enough because it would -- it

21

would prohibit defendants from bringing second habeas

22

petitions even as to things that are novel as to -- a

23

second in time rule would apply section 2244's rules to

a claim could not have been raised in a prior habeas

before you get off whether this is second or successive,

it is second or successive.

it's important because the statute does not use the

State itself concedes in its brief that it's not clear

how its system would apply in the case of somebody who

gets habeas relief and then later wants to seek habeas

relief based on an intervening decision of this Court.

The

Up until now that has been a perfectly easy

21

situation because the new judgment allows a new claim to

be brought, but under the State's rule it's unclear.

The State's rule is any new decision from

rise to a debate as to whether or not that claim was

previously available.

16

Let me tick off a couple of other things

17

before I sit down.

What about a situation the first

18

time where a claim is Teague-barred or procedurally

19

precluded or maybe even the defendant doesn't raise it

20

because under the facts that the first trial went

21

forward, it would have been harmless error.

22

All of those situations would raise very

23

difficult questions as to whether that claim, as the

24

State would put it, was previously available.

25

again, go back to the idea of having a new trial based

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Even,

Official - Subject to Final Review

on new -- based on new facts and new evidence.

2

to figure out whether it's the same claim, a different

3

claim; imagine a claim based on a prosecutor's closing

argument.

5

same script a second time, there is going to be a huge

6

fight over whether it's a new claim, an old claim, a

7

different claim.

Trying

Well, unless the prosecutor reads the exact

And finally, the State's other -- the other
prong of the State's test is about claims that were

10

raised before are now barred.

11

immediately recognizes that that's a huge problem

12

because it would bar defendants from making -- from

13

seeking habeas relief if the State made the same

14

violation the second time around.

15

brand-new due process principle that has never been held

16

to be -- to be in existence by this Court.

17

in the Penry case, where this Court dealt with the Texas

18

situation, where the State court made the same error

19

twice, it went straight to the constitutional claim.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Now, the State

So it invents a

23

MR. FISHER:

If it's the second

Well, it -- well, it shouldn't

24

be barred.

25

should be able to get relief the second time around.

Because it's a new judgment, the defendant

27
Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would be a very strange construction of the habeas

2

statute, and it wouldn't be law of the case because it

3

would be a new case, again, Justice Kennedy.

4

And finally, let me give you the situation

5

of claims the defendant raises but then loses on but is

6

unable to appeal.

7

defendant has many other claims that he loses on in the

8

district court or in the court of appeals.

9

State has a pickle here.

10

Imagine a case like this where the

Now, the

It has to either say that those claims are

11

forever barred from being raised again, even though the

12

defendant was deprived of a full right to appeal because

13

he won on something else and couldn't appeal the losses

14

on the other issues, or the State has to say that those

15

were -- that those were not previously available, those

16

claims were not previously available, in which all of

17

its rhetoric about resurrecting past claims drops away.
Again, a very difficult question that this

ORAL ARGUMENT OF COREY L. MAZE

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

5

MR. MAZE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Even though they rose together, the State

6

has litigated Magwood's mitigating circumstances in

7

Federal court from 1983 to 1986, and now we have been

8

litigating these aggravating circumstances from 1997

9

through today.

That's piecemeal litigation.

That's

10

precisely the reason that AEDPA was passed under 2244(b)

11

and that's precisely what the abuse of the writ doctrine

12

was designed to prevent.

13

And it's based on the principle that this

14

equitable principles that say when you have two parties,

And if I may, I want to go straight to

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Justice Alito's question about conviction versus

2

sentence, and then to Justice Kennedy's about whether or

3

not under Alabama law this is aggravated with something

4

new to the resentencing.

5

As far as judgment -- conviction versus

6

sentence, I had two answers.

Justice Breyer got to the

7

first.

8

would say, says, "I hereby judge you convicted of the

9

underlying offense in the actual guilt phase and the

On page 106, the new judgment, as Mr. Magwood

10

sentence."

So it contains both, if you consider that a

11

new judgment.
But the second point is, if Magwood is

12
13

correct that you can separate a judgment of sentence and

14

conviction, then Burton is wrong.

15

wrong.

16

In Re Taylor, which was the exact same case we put in

18

judgment of conviction; my second petition attacked the

19

judgment of resentence, and because those are two

20

separate judgments, this was my first chance to attack

21

the judgment of sentence.

22

Burton has to be

Because the argument in Burton was -- he cited

He said:

My first petition attacked the

And this Court said:

No, it's one judgment;

23

it's conviction and sentence.

And because your first

24

petition attacked that judgment that contained both,

25

your second petition attacks the same judgment that

30
Alderson Reporting Company

contained both.

2
3

So if Mr. Magwood is right that you can
separate the two, then Burton has to be wrong.

have to do -- it's a dilemma here.

is:

If you'll look at the district

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

court's opinion, its order from the first case -- it's

2

page 228 of the opinion -- it said:

that this case must be remanded to the State court for

4

resentencing on the existence of mitigating

5

circumstances, rather than two.

15

didn't tinker with it.

16

because they vacated the sentencing part.

17

Wait.

But they did tinker with it,

Now, why doesn't that work?

And his

18

argument is, that works much easier for the judges, much

19

easier for everybody, than to try to figure out whether

20

a claim could have or couldn't have been raised, whether

21

a sentence was changed from six years to five years, or

22

who knows what we are going to get into; et cetera.

23

MR. MAZE:

Because it's one of two things.

24

Either you vacated the entire judgment and the

25

conviction and sentence are put back together -- they

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

are -- it is a new judgment altogether.

2

specifically what the constitutional infirmity was that

3

the Court identified in that case.

4

Or you look at

The answer to Justice Kennedy's question is:

5

There are four things under Alabama law at the time of

6

this case that were necessary to have a death sentence.

7

The first was an indictment with an aggravating

8

circumstance.

9

offense.

The second was a conviction of a capital

The third was the State announcing an

10

aggravating circumstance.

11

phase recommendation from the jury that was unanimous.

And the fourth was a penalty

When this case went back, all four of those

12
13

things were carried over from the first trial.

14

didn't do any of those things again.

15

carried over.

16

The only thing new that happened was we added the two

mitigators to the weighing calculus and it was

18

reweighed.

court's opinion in the second case.

20

We

They were all

They are relics from the original trial.

And we know that is true from the district

Mr. Magwood claimed that he could bring a

21

claim against the fact that we didn't re-empanel the

22

penalty phase jury, which, again, is a sentencing claim,

23

and the district court said no, the State court didn't

24

have to re-empanel the jury to give another

25

recommendation, because that wasn't the problem in the

33
Alderson Reporting Company

2

having the two additional mitigators.

3

same rationale, the State's announcement of the

14

is, he is going to kill an entire line of cases, the

15

Kyzer cases, where you can challenge good time credits,

16

parole credits.

17

you are challenging your good time, you can raise that

18

in a 2254 petition.

19

read it as a second or successive application against a

20

judgment -- let's assume that you've lost in your first

21

habeas, so your first petition is now done and you have

22

lost.

23

this Court's precedent, you raised that in a 2254

24

petition, but that petition will be the second petition

25

under the same judgment.

If you remember, in Kyzer, you said if

Now, under Magwood's rule, if you

And he would be barred because

Alderson Reporting Company

the good time credit claims would meet an exception.

2

It's not new facts or law that proves he's innocent, and

3

therefore it is barred.

4

The only way that the circuits have been

5

able to deal with that situation is exactly the way the

6

State's saying here and that Justice Scalia is saying.

7

You ask the question first:

Is this a claim that has

And if it's not a claim that was

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And Mr. Fisher uses the

word "claim" as -- differently.

16

MR. MAZE:

Yes.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

He makes a distinction

between "issue" and "claim."

earlier, but, he says, it's not the same claim.

I have two answers to that, if I

This Court has

2

If you'll look at the question presented,

3

4

5

but now vacated sentence on the same constitutional

6

grounds."

relief and he admits that it's the same grounds he could

8

have gotten relief on the first time, it is the same

10

Now, to the extent he is telling you this is

11

a new injury, that -- the smoke example that Mr. Magwood

12

is talking about, we disagree with that; to the extent

13

that he would be right, the difference is in this case,

14

he asked us to blow the smoke at him a second time.

15

Remember what happened in the first proceeding.

16

didn't challenge the aggravating circumstance, and then

17

when we got to the court of appeals, he asked

18

specifically the Eleventh Circuit to send this case back

19

for resentencing so that the four mitigators could be

20

weighed against the original aggravator.

21

this to go back and to -- asked to have the aggravator

22

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But we just found that to

be successive under the words of the statute?

4

MR. MAZE:

Right.

But in Panetti -- if you

5

remember, in Panetti, he raised a -- he did not raise a

6

Ford claim the first time around, and this Court said

7

yes, if we looked at it only a second in time, this

8

would be barred, but we defined second or successive

9

application under the abuse of the writ doctrine.

And

10

because this was the first time this claim was right you

11

allowed him to do it and called it a first application,

12

and the reason was because he couldn't raise it the

13

first time.

14

Now, back to the point -­

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

16

Justice Scalia's point:

17

I thought your answer to

Suppose it was raised but the

18

MR. MAZE:

Right.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Your test, I take it, is

20

that he must have one full and fair opportunity to

21

litigate the question; that means to raise it, to have

22

it aired, and to have it decided.

23

MR. MAZE:

Absolutely.

The point would be,

24

it's not an abuse of the writ if you raise a claim the

25

first time but don't have the chance to have it

40
Alderson Reporting Company

2

3

then not doing it.

4

You abuse the writ, as this Court has

5

your view is a simple rule, no matter how many judgments

6

there are.

7

MR. MAZE:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

Right.
If this claim could have

been raised and would have been fully adjudicated had it
been, it's barred.

11

MR. MAZE:

Yes.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

But if either it couldn't

13

have been raised, or if it could have been raised and

14

wouldn't have been fully adjudicated or was not fully

15

adjudicated, not barred.

MR. MAZE:

What this Court has done since

22

AEDPA came out on two different occasions, has said the

would give substance in our previous habeas corpus

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
It's very realistic.

these other issues, which may be difficult?

MR. MAZE:

And it does happen.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.

10

assume your point is that he can raise -- he can raise

11

again issues that he raised before; it's no fault of his

12

that the Court didn't reach -­
MR. MAZE:

13

Yes, that's right.

Because he

didn't have the full and fair opportunity to have it

said in Martinez-Villareal.

them all in petition, too.

Now, I want to bring up a point on why this

18

matters to the State.

On page 48 of our red brief, we

19

showed you some statistics about the number of claims

20

the Petitioners bring, but what we didn't cite -- it's

21

on page 51 and 52 of the same study.

22

that after AEDPA, 13 percent of capital habeas petitions

23

nationwide -- and if you take Texas out, it's actually

24

18 percent -- are granted.

4

and this Court said res judicata doesn't apply in

5

Federal habeas proceedings, so that court is wrong.

It went up to this Court

But we understand the problems the courts

6
7

are going to have because there is no res judicata;

8

therefore we are creating this abuse of the writ

further point would be that, you know, Mr. Magwood keeps

21

saying that just because he won, this was different.

the claim itself is that I have did I have fair notice

22

12

with it because second or successive is a jurisdictional

13

question, and if the claim is second or successive, then

14

it's barred and we simply haven't gotten to it.

15

Again, Your Honors, all we are asking you to

16

do is uphold the abuse of the write doctrine for the

same reason the Court adopted it in 1924 all the way

18

through AEDPA, and that is we are going to force

19

petitioners to raise every claim they could the first

time, so we prevent the State, the victim's family and

the Federal court from going through second or third

points, Your Honor.

If I leave you with nothing else, think

about the argument that you just heard that again and

10

abuse of the writ.

Well, there is now a statute that

11

occupies this field, it's section 2254.

12

the writ principles apply only if a petition is second

very beginning of your argument?

about it; there is no anything about it.
Does your rule then mean that that

11
12

petitioner can come back and say, my fine was wrong, my

13

supervised release was wrong, other convictions, other

14

sentences that were consecutive or concurrent are wrong?
MR. FISHER:

15

Probably not.

But let me tell

16

you, Justice Sotomayor, that question can arise only in

17

a Federal situation.

18

which gets to the other important point I wanted to

19

make.

20

It cannot arise under section 2244

The State keeps talking about what the

21

district court said.

Well, when the State -- when this

22

case went to the Eleventh Circuit the first time, the

23

State made it very clear.

24

district court can't remand this to the State courts, it

25

can't micromanage what a State court does.

It complained, it said the

52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

All it can do -- and,

2

Justice Scalia, this is, I think, most clearly put in

3

your Wilkinson concurrence is order the release or not.

4

The Federal court in this case ordered Magwood's release

5

from the death penalty unless the defendant -- unless

6

the State wanted to elect to have a brandnew sentencing

7

proceeding.

8
9

Now, the State elected to do that,
and had every right to do it.

But Magwood also had

10

every right to insist on every constitutional protection

11

in that circumstance.
And if I might finish this

12
13

sentence, Mr. Chief Justice, when he -- we agreed if

14

that Mr. Magwood had not properly preserved this

15

argument the second time around, it would be

16

procedurally defaulted.

17

that argument on remand, it can.
