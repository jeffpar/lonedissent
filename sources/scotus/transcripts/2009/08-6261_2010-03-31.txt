CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

States, ex rel. Watson.

Ms. Frankfurt.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACLYN S. FRANKFURT

7
8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. FRANKFURT:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This case presents the question whether,

11
12

under our Constitution, the power to prosecute criminal

13

contempt in a Federal court rests solely with the

14

sovereign.

15

that a criminal offense may only be prosecuted by the

16

sovereign is a foundational premise of our Constitution.

17

Because Mr. Robertson was prosecuted for criminal

18

contempt in a private right of action, his prosecution

19

was unconstitutional, a nullity in our view, and his

20

convictions must be vacated.

21
22
23

The United States now agrees that the fact

Ms. Watson defends the lower court's ruling
that -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

He didn't make

24

that argument, though.

I mean, his -- as I recall, his

25

only complaint was that he had been promised that -­

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that he wouldn't be -- he wouldn't be prosecuted.

2

that was his only complaint below, wasn't it?
MS. FRANKFURT:

3
4

And

His complaint below was that

he had a plea agreement with the United States.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

MS. FRANKFURT:

Right.
And that the only lawful or

7

constitutional way he could have been prosecuted was in

8

an action brought by the United States; that the local

9

statute didn't authorize a private right of action, and

10

that the Constitution could not -­

11
12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

He made the constitutional

MS. FRANKFURT:

He said below that -- that a

claim below?

13
14

private right of action was neither lawful under the

15

local statutes nor constitutional, and the parties

16

responded that it was; and the lower court held it is

17

authorized by local statute; it's constitutional; in

18

fact, this was a private right of action prosecuted by

19

Ms. Watson on her own behalf and therefore your plea

20

agreement fails.

21

We have never argued, if it was actually her

22

prosecuting, that -- that she was bound by the plea

23

agreement.

24

can't be under the Constitution, it can't be under the

25

local statute.

We argued it can't be her prosecuting, it

And if it's the United States, then we

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

are entitled to the benefit of the plea agreement we had

2

with the United States.

3

The -- Ms. Watson defends the lower court

4

ruling that a private right of criminal action is

5

constitutional, but really has mounted -- excuse me -­

6

mounted very little attack on our constitutional

7

argument that the Constitution contemplates that crimes

8

are public wrongs brought on behalf of sovereigns.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Excuse me.

We have

10

plenty of plea agreements jurisprudence that say if the

11

Southern District of New York prosecutes someone and

12

they sign a plea agreement and say, we're not going to

13

prosecute you for further crimes, we read that to mean

14

that the Southern District of New York won't prosecute

15

you for further crimes.

16

government agency is bound, who has jurisdiction over

17

that criminal activity, that they are equally bound.

18

We don't read it that no other

So why isn't this case the same?

19

Assuming -- that you're making a broad statement, that

20

this has to be brought in the name of the government.

21

Assuming that's correct, does that mean that -- why does

22

that mean that both the U.S. Attorney's Office and the

23

Attorney General's Office, which appear to be two

24

different entities enforcing two different sets of law,

25

why would both be bound?

MS. FRANKFURT:

Well, it's important to

2

clarify, because there is -- there is a lack of -- it is

3

not parallel to the Federal system.

4

and I believe there is a circuit -- that the Second

5

Circuit says when the Southern District signs it's the

6

Southern District only, and the Third, Fourth, Eighth,

7

and Ninth view it differently when something reads as

8

broadly as this, which is the government.

So even assuming -­

Excuse me.

In the

It's not just

the Southern District; it's also what, the State?
MS. FRANKFURT:

12

No.

No, I believe in the

13

Second Circuit they might read something signed by the

14

Southern District as not binding in the Eastern

15

District.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MS. FRANKFURT:

I got you.
But in the District of

18

Columbia, only the United States Attorney prosecutes

19

criminal offenses of the type that occurred here.

20

is a bit of a red herring here from this plea form.

21

This is a plea form that is used in Superior Court both

22

in traffic offenses, which are the type of offenses that

23

the District of Columbia prosecutes, and in criminal

24

offenses.

25

There

And the cross-outs are just to conform the

plea form, so that if you cross out "D.C." it reads

2

"United States v. John Robertson," which is how -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

That did puzzle me.

I was

wondering if there's -- if there's coordinate

crimes that the Attorney General can prosecute for?

Can the -- can the District prosecute for

MS. FRANKFURT:

There is -- there is not

10

There is some -- some

and one goes to one, one goes to the other.
But all the offenses we're talking about

here are United States offenses.

option.

5

That's not in the picture as an

The -- the case -- if it's

6

prosecuted by a sovereign, it's prosecuted by the United

7

States, and the only argument that the Solicitor General

8

is now making is that that wouldn't bind if private

prosecutor representing the United States, as happened

10

in Young.

11

prosecutor in a criminal contempt case signs the plea

12

agreement on behalf of the United States, it's a binding

13

plea agreement and binds the -- the United States.

14

We have a local case that says when a private

So the cross-out on the plea form, I

15

believe, are a bit of a red herring.

16

the caption just makes it read United States v. John

17

Robertson in a felony, which is the only way felonies

18

can be prosecuted.

19

just makes it read the United States Attorney, who is

20

the only one who can sign such a form in a felony case.

21

And it doesn't define a particular prosecuting entity

22

between Federal and State, or between two different

23

Federal jurisdictions that have concurrent jurisdiction

24

over, let's say, mail fraud or something like that.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is this law unique to the

they are trying to get a handle on is domestic violence.

And the prosecutors are busy prosecuting drug crimes and

4

the rest.

5

the abused person to initiate this criminal contempt.

6

Are there other States that have the same procedure?

7

So the District's solution is, we will allow

MS. FRANKFURT:

I -- the -- the same

8

procedure is a question of how that is defined.

If the

9

question is whether there are other States that have a

10

wholly private right of action where the person is

11

construed as bringing it on her own behalf, not on

12

behalf of a sovereign, in a criminal case, we have seen

13

nothing -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

I -- I mean, however you

15

describe it in practical terms, are there other places

16

that say, abused person, you can initiate this and you

17

can have your lawyer present it, whether it's on behalf

18

of the State or -- but just the practical of how you go

19

through the motions; are there other States that allow

20

the victim?

21

MS. FRANKFURT:

Yes, there are other -­

22

there are other States that allow the complainant to

23

either bring it to the attention of the court in the

24

form of a request for an order to show cause and to

25

actually prosecute as a private prosecutor, the way,

let's say, in Young, they would have characterized a

private prosecutor -­

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In criminal cases, because

4

I -- I -- correct me if I am wrong, but my -- my

5

recollection is that orders to show cause for contempt

6

in the civil -- on the civil side occur frequently, and

7

that allows a jail sentence in California I think of 5

8

days -- and this is civil, because it's coercive.

9

you are talking about something different, I take it?

10

MS. FRANKFURT:

I am.

Now,

I am talking about

11

criminal contempt.

12

Columbia before this case came down there -- we had an

13

opinion, based on a local legislature's determination,

14

that said a beneficiary of a civil protection order may

15

initiate a criminal contempt proceeding and may act as

16

private prosecutor the way in -- in Young this Court

17

said as a matter of supervisory authorities they didn't

18

want interested parties.

19

For instance, in the District of

There are jurisdictions, I believe, that

20

allow for interested parties to take that role.

But the

21

role is the role of the lawyer on behalf of the

22

sovereign -- sovereign, whichever sovereign it is, who

23

is the ultimate party -­

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And, of course -­

25

MS. FRANKFURT -- and who can nolle the case.

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- the States don't have

2

the same compulsion that the Federal Government has,

3

which arises from the separation of powers.

4

which -- which means that it is the executive that has

5

the right to prosecute, and States are not bound by such

6

a thing.

7

to prosecute, whereas the only exception we have made

8

from the -- from the chief executive's authority to

9

prosecute is Young, which is a very narrow exception,

And -­

And they can perhaps allow private individuals

10

dealing with the Court's ability to protect itself from

11

contempt of its orders.

12
13
14

And here the court had nothing to do with
the appointment of this private party, right?
MS. FRANKFURT:

That's absolutely true.

In

15

our view to the extent there are any sort of exceptions

16

from procedural rights or the normal process in contempt

17

proceedings, they are narrowly tailored and governed by

18

the doctrine of necessity.

19

Respondent's counsel indicates, well, there are a lot of

20

differences in contempt and just add one to this list,

21

they make no attempt to ground that in the document of

22

necessity, which is really the only thing that -- that

23

justifies any sort of procedural difference in the

24

contempt context.

25

And that -- and so while

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Am I right that the

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

District has been following this procedure for quite

2

some time?
MS. FRANKFURT:

3

Yes.

Well, I guess it

4

depends on what the question what "this procedure" is.

5

The District -­

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, where a private

7

party initiates, the beneficiary of an order of this

8

kind, initiates a contempt proceeding against a person

9

who violates it, and seeks a punishment for it, not just

10

discontinuance.
MS. FRANKFURT:

11

Yes.

The -- the District

12

had a case where it said it believed itself not bound by

13

the supervisory authority of Young and it would allow

14

interested parties to prosecute contempt in the domestic

15

violence context only, not outside the domestic violence

16

context.

17

fashion since that time, which I believe was 1984.

18

it has -- it was not until this case that the issue

19

arose because of the plea agreement to suggest that that

20

person was prosecuting in her own name -­

21

And it has had cases prosecuted in that

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But

It doesn't say to me that

22

the plea agreement goes to the question of whether there

23

is sort of an inherent violation of the Constitution by

24

adopting this procedure at all.

25

MS. FRANKFURT:

I -- I -­

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I have trouble figuring

2

out whether the plea agreement has any relevance to the

3

kind of basic argument you are making.

4

MS. FRANKFURT:

Well, we actually see two

5

arguments, and maybe that's -- that we are making, which

6

may be part of the confusion.

7

If this proceeding really was, as the lower

8

court interpreted, the lower court -- the lower court

9

interpreted the local statute and what occurred and

10

said:

This really was a private right of action brought

11

by Ms. Watson on her own behalf; no government party

12

initiated it, controlled it; and we believe that is

13

constitutional.

14

that's what occurred, then we believe this Court could

15

well say that is unconstitutional.

That's what the lower court said.

If

We -- we defer to the lower court's view of

16
17

what occurred pursuant to the local statute.

This was a

18

private right of action, the lower court told us so, and

19

we don't think that the Constitution can tolerate such a

20

thing.

Well -­
We have another option,

once we say they were wrong on that premise, to send it

back and let them look at the second question, which is

10

whether or not a private party can bring an action in

11

the name of the sovereign.

12

MS. FRANKFURT:

Well, I think that the

13

second way to view it, as -- as I was going to say, is

14

what the Solicitor General of the United States now

15

agrees -- they thought below that it was Constitution,

16

but they now agree that the Constitution cannot tolerate

17

private criminal rights of action.

prosecutor decision was made, it was made on the same

foundational premise as Young, which was let's look and

But to

22

finish my -- my answer to Justice Sotomayor and Justice

23

Stevens as to the second route:

24

the Solicitor General I believe is asking this Court to

25

do is to say it's not constitutional to have such an

If this Court -- what

15
Alderson Reporting Company

sovereign.

4

This Court -- if this Court goes that route,

5

as opposed to deferring to the way the lower court

6

described it, rather says this must have been on behalf

7

of the sovereign, the sovereign was the United States,

8

then the question is whether the plea agreement barred

9

it.

10

The lower court said the plea agreement

11

didn't bar it because it was Ms. Watson's; obviously it

12

didn't bar it.

But if in fact it was on behalf of the United States,

This -- again, I'm trying to see the case in

17

the broad -- in the broader sense.
Supposing there is a civil lawsuit that's

18
19

settled and part of the settlement is a consent decree

20

that would enjoin certain conduct, and the defendant

21

then violates the decree and engages in the prohibited

22

conduct.

23

prosecute for contempt would be the sovereign?

Are you saying that the only person who could

MS. FRANKFURT:

Yes.

Now whether -- whether

2

in some situations a private prosecutor could be

3

appointed -­

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So, no, the question would

5

be whether the lawyer for the -- the party who entered

6

into the settlement could bring a contempt proceeding

7

against the adversary who had violated the settlement.

8
9
10
11

MS. FRANKFURT:

On their own behalf?

don't -- I don't believe so.

I

Not a criminal contempt

proceeding.
We are drawing a fairly rigid distinction

12

between who the lawyer is and who the lawyer represents.

13

In our view, the party in a criminal action has to be

14

the sovereign, the United States.

15

Now in the contempt context there is a

16

limited exception for appointment of private prosecutors

17

when the executive is declining to prosecute and the

18

judiciary needs to vindicate its authority, and if it's

19

referred to the public prosecutor in the Young situation

20

and the public prosecutor has declined but the judiciary

21

still needs to vindicate its authority, it can appoint a

22

private attorney to represent the sovereign.

23

But at root it's the sovereign that is

24

prosecuting, no matter who the lawyer is who is standing

25

in the courtroom.

And the problem in this case was the

20

1

holding of the lower court that said -- that Ms.

2

Watson -- it was her case.

3

her case; the lawyer said I can't control her; she gets

to make all the decisions.

The prosecutor said it was

JUSTICE STEVENS:

What do you think the best

6

authority from this Court for your basic proposition is?

7

What is your strongest case?

8

MS. FRANKFURT:

I think the strongest case

is Gompers v. Buck's Stove.

That says fundamentally -­

10

and I'm not quoting verbatim -- but it says

11

fundamentally erroneous as if a tort action of A -- for

12

15

our lower court said was solely between private parties.

New York, does it -- does bind, do you think, the

What is your view

I know it's not part of this case.

MS. FRANKFURT:

Right.

21
Alderson Reporting Company

My view is this

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Court should go with the Third and Fourth Circuits who

2

have -- expressed -- quite eloquently about the United

3

States not being a bunch of separate fiefdoms, but that

4

when the United States speaks, they speak for the

5

government at large.

6

of some of the cases that were cited, where it says the

7

United States will make a recommendation to the

8

Immigration and Naturalization Service, and then the

9

criminal defendant comes back and says well, the INS is

10
11

That is different than a case -­

down, too.
And people looks at the agreement and say

12

well, no one would have read that to mean that the

13

United States included INS, because they were talking

14

about a recommendation to INS.

15

But when the government has written in, my

16

view is that -- that the Third Circuit and the Fourth

17

Circuit speak eloquently to that.

18

that issue is presented here, given the context on which

19

it arises in D.C. where this is conduct that should only

be prosecuted in D.C. court by the United States.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG

6

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

7
8

MR. LONG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

9

I think it's very important to be clear

10

about what is properly before the Court.

11

out as a case about a plea agreement, and the

12

Petitioner's claim is that his plea agreement with the

13

U.S. Attorney barred his criminal contempt proceeding.

14

He has not made the claim that a private interested

15

party may not bring a criminal contempt proceeding.

16

has said -­

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This started

Yes, but the

18

argument is that because a private interested party

19

can't bring it, the party is bringing it on behalf of

20

the United States and his plea agreement therefore is

21

with the United States.

22

MR. LONG:

He

Well, I mean if I could,

23

Mr. Chief Justice, there are I think several questions

24

in the case, and some are actually no longer in dispute

25

so that will help to simplify a very complicated matter

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

a little bit.

2

One is according to the question presented,

3

whether the criminal contempt proceeding for violating a

4

civil protective order must be brought in the name of

5

the United States, so actually have United States in the

6

caption.

7

is no constitutional requirement that the caption of the

8

case actually say "United States."

9

that answers the question about what does the plea

And I think now all the parties agree, there

So to the extent

10

agreement cover, we don't have a dispute about that.

11

There's no constitutional reason why the court of

12

appeals has to be reversed.

13

So the other part of the question, as it's

14

framed in the question is does it have to be brought

15

pursuant to the power of the United States.

16

language that is in the court of appeals opinion -­

2

MR. LONG:

Yes.

Is the real party in

interest the United States?

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

MR. LONG:

Exactly.

And I agree, that's mostly what

5

we have to talk about this morning, but I'm trying to

6

bracket it with issues that are really not properly in

7

dispute here.

8
9

One is, the caption is not a constitutional
issue.

Another is, as Petitioner has said over and over

10

again, the actual ability of a private, interested

11

party, the question that was left open in Young, under

12

the Constitution, under the Due Process Clause or under

13

separation of powers, is that constitutional for

14

Ms. Watson to even do this, as the representative of the

15

United States or on her own behalf?
They have said over and over again, they are

16
17

not raising that question.

In their reply brief to the

18

court of appeals, they say they in no way challenge

19

that.

20

appeals, they say the assertion that they are

21

challenging it is just wrong.

22

brief to this Court at the cert stage, they say they -­

23

they decline to raise that question.

reply brief here, they say they have not raised the

25

issue left unresolved in Young.

think that issue is really -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3
4

And I

see as that issue?

5

Can you define what you

What's the issue that you think -­

MR. LONG:

That's the issue of whether a

6

private interested party, either on their own behalf or

7

as the representative of the sovereign, can bring a

8

criminal contempt action.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What do you mean?

10

their own -- not on their own behalf.

11

that's a quite different issue.

12

was decided below, whether -­

13

MR. LONG:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Not on

I mean, that -­

That's the issue that

Yes.
-- whether a private

15

interested party can be authorized to bring the suit on

16

behalf of the sovereign.

17
18

MR. LONG:

Yes.

What I'm trying to do is

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I understand, but you -­

narrow down to -­

19
20

you covered two things.

You said whether a private

21

individual can bring it on his own.

22

MR. LONG:

Right.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Or whether a private

24

individual can be appointed to bring it on behalf of the

25

sovereign.

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. LONG:

Yes.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I thought it was

3

only -- only the second of these that you say is out of

4

the case.

You say the first is out of the case, too?

5

MR. LONG:

No.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

MR. LONG:

No.

I think -- I think the -- all

8

they have conceded is that for purposes of this case, we

9

are going to assume that -- well, I may have given you

10

the wrong answer to you -- we are -- they have said over

11

and over again, we assume, that a private interested

12

party can bring a criminal contempt proceeding.

13

we think, given the importance of -­

14
15
16
17
18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And so

As representative of

the sovereign?
MR. LONG:

Well, I -- I think that question

is fairly before the Court.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And nobody doubts --

19

I didn't think it was at issue that the United States,

20

rather than operating through the Assistant U.S.

21

Attorney, can appoint you to handle the prosecution.

22

MR. LONG:

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

don't dispute, right?

25

MR. LONG:

Exactly.

Exactly.
And that's what they

Maybe a different way of making

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

they don't dispute that?

trying to make?

That's the point you were

5

MR. LONG:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

me.

I'm sorry, that's -­

Yes.
Okay.

I'm sorry, repeat it for

I sort of -­

9

MR. LONG:

The point is, they are not

10

disputing, and they've said over and over again they're

11

not disputing that a private, interested individual,

12

like Ms. Watson, the individual in this case, can bring

13

this proceeding.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14
15

Now -­
On whose behalf?

That's

the issue that I'm trying to -­
MR. LONG:

16

And the issue that I think is

17

before the Court is, would that be as a representative

18

of the United States or would that be as a private

19

person?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

Okay.

Are you saying

21

that it's out of the case that if we say it's on behalf

22

of the United States, they are not challenging that they

23

can do that?

24
25

MR. LONG:

Yes.

Yes.

I think they have not

challenged that.

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's so -- so if we

say they can act on behalf of the United States, you -­
MR. LONG:

3

Yes.

And I will say, there is an

4

oddity to this, because in many ways, the bigger

5

question is the question that the Court left open in

6

Young, since that's not been properly raised, not

7

properly decided, by the court below, not properly

8

briefed, it is a little odd to be answering this other

9

question of:

Well, assuming that the private party can

10

do this, would it be in the interest of the United

11

States?

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

So in other words, if, in

13

fact -- you agree or don't agree, I don't know -- but

14

the government says and they say, the government of the

15

United States has here -- and it can, under the

16

Constitution, delegate to a private person the authority

17

to prosecute.

18

MR. LONG:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

Right.
There is a big argument

against that.

21

MR. LONG:

Yes.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

The argument is:

This

23

would be the one person you can't delegate it to because

24

they are very biased.

25

MR. LONG:

Right.

And my -­

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

JUSTICE BREYER:

And that argument, you say,

is not in this case.

3

MR. LONG:

Exactly.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Exactly.

Okay.

So -­

So now we have what

5

is in the case, which is the question of whether,

6

leaving that argument out of it, did they hear or -­

7

MR. LONG:

So let me now address the point

8

that:

Is it a constitutional requirement?

No matter

9

what the legislature says, that any criminal contempt

10

proceeding must be brought in the interest of the

11

sovereign, not in the interest of a private party.

12

may seem like a fairly obvious proposition, but I want

13

to submit it's actually much harder than the Court

14

actually should agree.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

That

I don't know what you mean

16

by "in the interest of"?

17

you mean?

18

it is on behalf of the United States but you say it

19

doesn't have to be in the interest of the United States,

20

is that it?

21

On behalf of?

Is that what

Are you saying -- you acknowledge here that

MR. LONG:

Well, the language that the court

22

of appeals used is in the interest of the United States.

23

Who is the real party in interest?
JUSTICE SCALIA:

24
25

means.

I don't know what that

Are you asserting that this suit has been

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

brought on behalf of the United States by your client?

2

MR. LONG:

No.

I want to make an argument

3

that actually, the D.C. legislature and the D.C. courts

4

are constitutionally permitted to determine that in this

5

specific situation, the interests of the individual

6

actually predominate over the interests of the

7

government and there is not a constitutional problem.

8
9
10

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why is that even relevant?

Why do you even get to that?

Isn't the question what

the parties understood the plea agreement to mean?
MR. LONG:

11

Well, I agree with you completely

12

Justice Alito.

13

you say.

14

of the plea agreement, it does not bar this proceeding.

15

As Justice Stevens said, these have gone on for.

16

The ultimate question is exactly what

And we think under any reasonable construction

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's highly relevant, I

17

think, because I think you would you like to make the

18

argument, which I would like to hear, is that:

19

the United States.

20

to bring the case as a private citizen.

The Constitution permits this woman

21

MR. LONG:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

Forget

Yes.
Now, if you are right about

that, the plea agreement drops out.

24

MR. LONG:

Yes.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Because nobody says made a

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

plea agreement with her.

2

you want to make at some point.

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. LONG:

Because that is the argument

I will make the argument,

5

although if I am wrong, I still think the plea agreement

6

doesn't bar this prosecution.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Here's -­

But, well -- well, with

8

respect, even if the Constitution permits this, if the

9

parties understood the plea agreement to mean that this

10

was going to be barred, then why isn't that the end of

11

the matter?

12

MR. LONG:

Well, it's what a reasonable

13

person would have understood Justice Alito, when the

14

plea agreement says, crosses out District of Columbia,

15

crosses out corporation counsel, and we are now all

16

agreed that Ms. Watson, in her own name, can bring this

17

proceeding under a statute that authorizes it and has

18

for 20 years -­

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

And I suppose the argument

20

could be that the -- that the government has no

21

authority under D.C. law to enter into such an

22

agreement, as well require these two -­

23

MR. LONG:

Well, that's -- now we are

24

getting into statutory issues, Justice Alito.

21
22

Yes, and let me make that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's perfectly okay,

right?
MR. LONG:

23

If -- if that is a constitutional

24

requirement.

It is in Blackstone, we admit that, for

25

crimes in general, but we are talking about contempt.

33
Alderson Reporting Company

But if it's a constitutional requirement, it has got to

2

be in the Constitution someplace.

3

because the Constitution uses words like "crimes."

have the Furies gradually giving way to justice.

MR. LONG:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Boasting.

Then is this

Well -­
Well, before I can answer

6

that question, I would like to know whether the

7

government could appoint the private person.

8

there is a check -- there is a check against the total

9

Furies, it's the government doing it.

After all

Now you say no,

10

the government can't do it, so -- but they can do it on

11

their own.

Maybe -- I don't know.

12

MR. LONG:

Well -­

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

How do I get my -- how do I

14

begin to answer these questions bound together in my

15

mind in some partial way?
MR. LONG:

16

Well, part -- part of the answer

17

is, of course, that the court exercises control.

18

Another part of the answer is that the D.C. legislature,

19

which is exercising delegated legislative authority from

20

Congress, has determined that this is in the public

21

interest.
And you know, the third part of it is that

22
23

we are not granting these private individuals excessive

24

authority.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

But you want to do that.

38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

You see, so there is no control.

You are saying we want

2

the private individuals to have the authority to bring

3

criminal contempt; they are on their own; they decide

4

it.

5

a totally private matter.

The government has nothing to say about this.

6

MR. LONG:

It's

No, but -- but you know, D.C.

7

tried for over a decade to do this with public

8

prosecutors, and there just were not enough resources.

You are looking for a section of the

4

Constitution; I suggest Article II, Section 1, the

5

executive power shall be vested in the President.

6

MR. LONG:

Well, but -­

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And just as the executive

8

power includes the power to expend funds appropriated by

9

Congress, so also the executive power except in the -­

10

in the instance of necessity acknowledged by Young,

11

which I think was wrongly decided anyway -- except in

12

that one narrow instance, the -- the power to prosecute

13

belongs to the executive.
MR. LONG:

14

But -- but Justice Scalia, we are

15

dealing with the District of Columbia.

16

unconstitutional, because private prosecutions were -­

Private prosecutions were common at the time of
You have got to go back a long way before

MR. LONG:

Well, I mean there -- that issue

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is debated in the briefs and I think it was less common

2

in the colonies in the United States than it was in

3

Britain, but certainly wouldn't have been regarded as -­

4

as unconstitutional.

5

But this is -- now we are back to the

6

question that I say really the Court should not decide

7

because it was never properly -- whether this can be

8

done by a private individual at all, even as the

9

representative of the government.

10

should get into that.

11

But if you do -­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

So I don't think you

I'm not sure why -- how

we can avoid it.
MR. LONG:

14

Well, you could wait for a case

15

that presents it -- that properly presents it, where it

16

can be decided -­

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, this case properly

18

presents the argument that a private party can't bring a

19

criminal prosecution on their -- in their own -- perhaps

20

their own name, they can, but on their own, in their own

21

interest.

22

That's what the argument is.

23

It always has to be a government interest.

MR. LONG:

Yes.

And that -- that is

24

something that the Court we think could properly decide.

25

But Justice Breyer, I would -­

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You are saying the

2

answer to that is, no, they can bring a claim in their

3

own name?

4

MR. LONG:

Yes, we -- we are arguing two

5

things.

6

unconstitutional; and they can certainly -- they could

7

certainly bring it as the representative of the

8

government, that is also constitutional.

9

there are two ways -­

10

They can bring it in their own name, that's not

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, no.

And -- and so

But the last

11

question is the one that they are disputing; it can't be

12

in their own interest.

13

MR. LONG:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

Yes, absolutely.
And you are saying it

can.

16

MR. LONG:

Yes.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

MR. LONG:

Answer why.

Because the D.C. Council said

19

they could do it.

So we have a legislature that has

20

said that the interest of a private party here takes

21

precedence, and that is not an unconstitutional

22

determination by the legislature.

23

criminal contempt cases, the Court has said we don't

24

look to whose interest is paramount or what this -- the

25

legislature or what the Court says whose interest is

In this Court's

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

paramount.

2

We recognize that both kinds of contempt,

3

civil and criminal, further the sovereign's interest in

4

vindicating the court's orders and further the private

5

interest in seeing that that order which applies

6

particularly to that party is followed.

7

So you don't look to that at all.

You just

8

look to the nature of the punishment.

9

determinate sentence versus a coercive sentence, then

10

it's criminal.

11

Brady and what sort of due process -­

So that answers all the questions about

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

And if it's a

You might -- you might -­

13

you might say this.

14

here, there are a couple of ways of doing this.

15

you would say is, well, don't worry about this so much.

16

If the answer is no, you can still bring your private

17

prosecution but you have got to get government

18

permission, because you are doing it in the way of the

19

government.

20

To answer your question that is
One way

But if the answer to the question is if you

21

can't do either, they you might say, then why wouldn't

22

you say why well, aren't we back to the Eumenides, and

23

the answer is going to be this is say contempt.

24

Contempt is special.

25

I don't know whether either or both of those

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

ways would work.

2

government has changed its position, of sending this

3

back so some of these things can be worked out?

4

least we would have some opinions that would help us.

5

So what would you think, since the

MR. LONG:

At

Well, you know, I think that

6

would be an unfortunate result in the sense that, you

7

know, the plea agreement in our view doesn't prevent

8

this prosecution on any reasonable interpretation.

9

know, we also think for the reasons I have been trying

10

to spell out that there is no real basis for the Court

11

to hold that it is unconstitutional, only in the

12

criminal contempt setting, for the D.C. legislature to

13

find that the private interest here justifies allowing

14

the private party to bring this action but it's still

15

criminal.

all the due process just as you would as -- if the

sovereign power on behalf of the Article I court, the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Courts don't have the power

7

power of the Court.

8
9

I mean, if you are prosecuting

GENERAL KAGAN:

I -- I don't believe that is

the case, Justice Scalia.

Imagine Respondent

10

essentially doing the same function that an appointed

11

person would do in Young.

12

appointed the person to prosecute contempt.

13

Respondent is essentially doing the same thing, is

14

acting in order to prosecute a contempt on the court and

15

to vindicate the -­

21

power to appoint that prosecutor, but I would think it's

22

extraordinary to say that there's nothing but the

23

court's power in play.

24
25

GENERAL KAGAN:

Surely it was

Now, the court was given the

of the United States.

3

Respondent is no doubt exercising sovereign power and

4

exercising it on behalf of the United States ultimately.

5

The court is created through power
It's an Article I court.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And so

Then why doesn't an

6

agreement by the United States not to prosecute carry

7

the day?

8
9

GENERAL KAGAN:

Yes, so this goes to the

second question, in which I think Respondent is right.

10

And the reason is that when a single U.S. Attorney's

11

Office says that the government will decide to drop a

12

certain set of charges, that U.S. Attorney's Office we

13

believe is -- is speaking for itself, unless there is

14

some indication that it is speaking more widely in such

15

a way that will bind other parts of the government.

GENERAL KAGAN:

Assuming that the U.S.

14

Attorney in the second office has jurisdiction and

15

assuming that the plea agreement does not say anything

16

to suggest that it should be read more broadly, I think

17

the answer is yes.

Well, how do you

There

One is the Second

1

and Seventh Circuit and they take the position that I've

2

taken, which is that the default position is that the

3

contracting party binds only the contracting party and

4

that the plea agreement needs to say something in order

5

to apply more broadly.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It can't do that.

7

If the U.S. attorney in New Jersey has the authority to

8

prosecute this, the U.S. Attorney in New York can't say,

9

oh, and by the way I bind all the other U.S. Attorneys.

10

GENERAL KAGAN:

Well, the U.S. Attorney in

11

New York could -- presumably that U.S. Attorney will

12

know who else might have jurisdiction over the

13

underlying conduct and would go and get an agreement

14

from those other U.S. attorneys.

We actually don't think that

that's right, Justice Stevens.

the U.S. Attorney did not bind the Respondent, but we

to prosecute.

GENERAL KAGAN:

Well, I do think that that's

the situation that we find in Young, where a court

10

appoints a person to prosecute a contempt on behalf of

11

the court.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Not on behalf of the court.

13

On behalf of the government, and that's why Young said

14

you should offer it first to the United States Attorney,

15

and only if he won't bring it, then you can appoint

somebody else to bring it.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

MS. FRANKFURT:

Thank you.

I just want to say in response both to -- to

7

Mr. Long's comments, that a lack record as to what

8

actually occurred or the general comment, about whether

9

or not Ms. Watson was treated as a State actor --

I

10

actually think there is a -- a decent record in this

11

case that what occurred was not a motion to request the

12

court to issue a show cause, but in fact, a -- a motion

13

that requested -- that triggered a ministerial act,

14

which was an act -- which was used as a charging

15

document, which the judge believed she had no

16

discretion, and the Assistant Attorney General, who was

17

representing the Petitioner, believed she had no

18

discretion to control, and Ms. Watson was treated as

19

bringing the action on her own behalf.
That's what the lower court held as a

factual matter, and I think it is quite supported by the

record.

The

25

satisfied that no objectively reasonable person could

understand that Mr. Robertson's plea agreement bound

Ms. Watson and precluded her contempt proceeding against

5

If we accept that, is there any other

MS. FRANKFURT:

If you -- yes.

The issue is

6

whether she could constitutionally bring the case on her

7

own.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

And did you preserve that?

If -- if Mr. -- Mr. Robertson had said, I understand

10

this only means that I am not going to be charged with a

-- a criminal offense by the United States Attorney's

12

Office for the District of Columbia, and it has no

13

application to this civil contempt proceeding.
MS. FRANKFURT:

14

We absolutely raise that

15

because our argument from -- from the very beginning was

16

she can't constitutionally be representing herself in

17

this proceeding.

18

she represents the United States, and if she represents

19

the United States, then our plea agreement bars it

the notion of a private person bringing a criminal

proceeding on the ground that it would be
