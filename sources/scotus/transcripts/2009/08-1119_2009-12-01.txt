ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR.

ON BEHALF OF MILAVETZ, GALLOP &

10

MILAVETZ, P.A., ET AL.

11
12

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

13

Section 526(a)(4) is unconstitutional

14

because it proscribes truthful information about

15

entirely lawful activity, it whipsaws the attorneys who

16

are trying to apply it, it creates an impossible

17

situation for them, and it harms the client.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If it were confined to

19

unlawful activity and narrowly drawn, do you concede

20

that such a statute would be constitutional?

21
22

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Perhaps, Justice Kennedy, but

the real challenge is to actually do that narrowing.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You say "perhaps."

Yes or

24

no?

Can Congress by an appropriately, an appropriately

25

drawn narrow statute, prohibit attorneys from advising,

1

A, criminal conduct in reference to a bankruptcy; or, B,

2

civil conduct -- conduct that is improper under the

3

civil code because it's a fraud on creditors?

4

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Yes, Justice Kennedy, if it

5

were narrowly drawn to apply to criminal activity or

6

fraudulent activity, yes.

7

well-established meanings.

8

This statute, of course, does not do that.

9

Those terms have
We know how to apply them.

Now, the government does not defend the

10

statute as written.

The government seeks to rewrite it,

11

but the manner in which the government seeks to rewrite

12

the statute really doesn't work under the statutory

13

terms.

We do not have that guidance.

14

The government in its brief proposes three

15

different formulations of how it might be narrowed.

16

None of those work, even if we -- we were to accept any

17

of those formulations.

The government simply would trade a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We do

But there's already in

22

the statute an -- a required attestation from the lawyer

23

who signs a bankruptcy petition that the petition does

24

not constitute an abuse.

25

MR. BRUNSTAD:

This is 707(b).
Yes, Justice Ginsburg.
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the words are

2

something like "does not constitute an abuse."

3

apparently it has meaning there.

4

don't we say, well, whatever it means in 707(b), it also

5

means in 5, whatever it is.

6

MR. BRUNSTAD:

So

Why doesn't -- why

Two reasons, Justice

7

Ginsburg.

First, the 707(b) abuse standard is a

8

completely different context.

9

to the access to bankruptcy relief.

It involves gatekeeping

10

The second reason is that Congress -- there

11

is no indication whatsoever, in the legislative history

12

or elsewhere, that Congress intended to import the abuse

13

standard under Section 707 into the 526(a)(4) context.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, again in the

15

hypothetical context, could Congress enforce by a

16

statute what it requires in the attestation clause?

17

MR. BRUNSTAD:

No, Justice Kennedy, because

18

the abuse standard is too nebulous to satisfy, I think,

19

scrutiny under the First Amendment.

20
21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

clause cannot be the basis for sanctioning an attorney.

22

MR. BRUNSTAD:

23

sanctioning an attorney -

24
25

You think the attestation

It can be the basis for

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean, how can that be if

it's too vague.
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Well, I think, Your Honor,

2

that the gateway to the bankruptcy procedures or

3

basically provisions, like section 707 or in the Chapter

4

11 context, basically are equitable inquiry that looks

5

into the totality of the circumstances, whether what the

6

lawyer has done or what the debtor has done -- and

7

really it looks to what the debtor has done -- would be

8

such that it would deny access to bankruptcy relief.

9

Has the debtor engaged in inequitable conduct, engaged

10

in inequitable conduct in some way that would basically

11

shut the door to bankruptcy relief?

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The attestation clause is

13

designed to ensure that the attorney has performed in an

14

ethical and proper way, I take it.

15

MR. BRUNSTAD:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17
18

In a sense.
Isn't that one of its

purposes?
MR. BRUNSTAD:

I think it goes more towards

19

the attorney checking the information that the debtor

20

has basically provided in the petition and elsewhere to

21

make sure that the information that's provided is

22

accurate and that the bankruptcy petition is not being

23

proposed in essence for an abusive purpose.

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I won't take up too much

more of your argument, but it just seems to me odd that
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you can enforce an attestation clause, but not a statute

2

that does the same thing.

3

principle for that.

4

designed to facilitate the bankruptcy process.

5

the government could say the same thing about its

6

statute.

7

I don't understand the

You say it's a gateway and it's

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Well,

Except, I think, Your Honor,

8

that whereas for the purposes of getting into bankruptcy

9

or staying in bankruptcy is one standard that courts

10

apply basically on an equitable basis, that analysis -

11

what Congress did there, it didn't have in mind First

12

Amendment concerns.

13

narrowly tailor the statutory regime so that lawyers

14

basically can understand what they are doing in a way

15

and communicate it to their client.

16
17

It didn't have in mind trying to

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, Congress often

forgets about the First Amendment, but lawyers don't.

18

MR. BRUNSTAD:

19

that's the heart of the problem here.

20

is that when Congress basically -- first of all,

21

Congress didn't import the 707(b) standard into

22

526(a)(4).

23

That's true, Your Honor, and

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The problem here

What are the words in

24

707(b)?

I mean, they are both in the statute.

25

lawyer has to attest to is required by statute.

Alderson Reporting Company

What the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. BRUNSTAD:

That is true, Justice

2

Ginsburg.

3

the legislative history or otherwise, that Congress

4

intended the 707{b} standard to be the standard that

5

governs what the lawyer can tell the client under

6

section 526 (a)(4).

7

But there is no evidence that Congress, in

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But isn't there another

8

problem?

Even if Congress didn't think of the problem,

9

don't we have the duty to construe the statute to avoid

10

constitutional problems if there is any reasonable basis

11

for doing so?

12

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Yes, Justice Stevens, but

13

this statute is not reasonable susceptible to the

14

government's interpretation.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That is an entirely

16

different argument from the fact that Congress didn't

17

think of this problem.

18

MR. BRUNSTAD:

That's correct, Justice

19

Stevens.

But the problem here is that what the

20

government has tried to do is tease out a standard from

21

the "in contemplation of" language in 526(a)(4), and the

22

problem is that -- two problems:

23

contemplation of" language only modifies half the

24

statute, so the "or pay the attorney" prong is not even

25

addressed by the government's construction.

One, the "in

9
Alderson Reporting Company

They kind

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of ignore that.

2

The second problem is that the "in

3

contemplation of" language cannot bear the weight the

4

government would have it bear.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

6

means?

7

bankruptcy" means?

8

What do you think that

What do you think "in contemplation of

MR. BRUNSTAD:

I think it means what the

9

Court said it meant in the Pender case interpreting

10

section 60(d) of the former Bankruptcy Act of 1898.

11

That is, whether bankruptcy is likely or imminent; in

12

contemplation of bankruptcy, taking some action where a

13

bankruptcy case is imminent or likely.

14

Now, it appears -

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, let's say someone goes

16

to the lawyer and they discuss the person's debt

17

situation and the decision is made that a bankruptcy

18

petition is going to be filed at some future date.

19

you think that everything that that person does after

20

that point is done in contemplation of bankruptcy?

21
22
23

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Do

Not necessarily, Justice

Alito?
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well then, why not?

The

24

person drives home in contemplation of bankruptcy, the

25

person has lunch in contemplation of bankruptcy.
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Well, I think that would -

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Doesn't it mean -- "in

3

contemplation of bankruptcy" means because of the

4

expectation of filing a bankruptcy petition later?

5

MR. BRUNSTAD:

I think that that would

6

assume that the filing of the bankruptcy petition looms

7

entirely in the consciousness of the debtor when the

8

debtor does everything.

9

"in contemplation of" clause, which is also used in

But I do -- I do think that the

10

section 529, is a neutral phrase.

"In contemplation of"

11

means nothing more than is the bankruptcy filing likely?

12

It doesn't have any nefarious, it doesn't have any

13

abusive context to it at all.

14

For example, section 329 -

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Wait.

It doesn't mean is

16

it likely.

17

you are doing this is the contemplated bankruptcy.

18

don't see any causal connection in that phrase?

19

"In contemplation of" means that the reason

MR. BRUNSTAD:

You

I do see a causal connection,

20

but there is no element of doing something improper in

21

the language "in contemplation of."

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's true.

That

23

may be true enough.

24

because you are about to file a bankruptcy petition.

25

But -- but the act must be taken

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Yes, Justice Scalia.
11

Alderson Reporting Company

But the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

government relies and hinges its argument on the abusive

2

connotation to the "in contemplation of."

3
4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's a different

question.

5

MR. BRUNSTAD:

That doesn't exist.

So what

6

the government is trying to do is rewrite the statute by

7

importing meaning into a phrase that has never been

8

there and doesn't exist there.

9

Every time we see the "in contemplation of"

10

phrase appearing either under the current law or under a

11

prior law, if there was some element of abuse coupled

12

with it that was separately stated, and of course there

13

is no separate statement here.

14

Now, again I go back to the fact that this

15

-- the practical effect of section 526(a)(4) is to make

16

an impossible situation for attorneys.

17

regimes:

18

rules which say you have to give unfettered candid

19

advice to your client; and this provision which gives

20

As an attorney can you

13

but it's a commercial transaction.

14

15

would the person then protect your right to give

16

unethical advice.

17

MR. BRUNSTAD:

I mean, this is a

19

20

advice about lawful activity.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The problem is that the

We are assuming that

22

it's not read with a limitation with respect to abusive

23

conduct.

24

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Correct.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But just as -

Assuming that is read

13
Alderson Reporting Company

into the statute or is viewed as part of "in

contemplation of bankruptcy," what in the First

3

Amendment would make that be?

4

MR. BRUNSTAD:

6

the term "abusive" which the government wants to

interlineate into the statute is itself inherently

vague, unlike "fraudulent conduct -

The First Amendment would not

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Which doesn't explain

why.

11

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Because "abusive," it's like

12

"seditious utterances."

13

normal person who just looks at it would be able to

14

understand what it means.

15
16

It's not something which a

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You don't understand

what it means as a lawyer?

17

MR. BRUNSTAD:

I have some ideas about what

19

subject to a whole panoply of remedies, some very

Let's accept your point that "abusive" is not

there and the government is reading in out of nowhere.

2

What's -- what's the matter with the statute then?

3

MR. BRUNSTAD:

I'll give you --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It just prohibits giving

5

advice in contemplation of bankruptcy that somebody

6

incur more debt.

7

What's unlawful about that?

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Well, I'll give you -- I'll

8

give you a perfect example.

Suppose the debtor's

9

problem is that he lives in a house that is too

10

expensive for him.

11

financial distress.

12

would logically suggest:

13

incurring debt, the lease obligation.

MR. BRUNSTAD:

It would be, Justice Scalia,

if the debtor comes to you in financial distress, is

19

thinking about filing for bankruptcy, and wants the

20

advice in that context.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If the only reason the

22

lawyer gives the advice is because he knows that this -

23

that this debtor is planning to file bankruptcy, he

says, if you are going to file bankruptcy, you better

sell the house and move to an apartment, then it's no

good.

Now, it may be a stupid law, but I don't see why

2

it's -- why it's unconstitutional.

3
4

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Because it's perfectly

legitimate advice about perfectly lawful activity.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

MR. BRUNSTAD:

So it's a stupid law.
Well, what happens is that

7

basically it interferes with the lawyer's ability

8

through speech to communicate full and candid advice to

9

the client.

10
11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's why

it's a stupid law.

12

MR. BRUNSTAD:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

Exactly.

And ultimately under Now, where is the

prohibition of stupid laws in the Constitution?

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Justice Scalia, I think the

17

problem here is that this stupid law does not pass

18

either strict scrutiny and it is substantially

19

overbroad.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How much of your

21

case depends upon the difficulty of defining what -- if

22

you accept the idea that "in contemplation of" means

23

abusive or fraudulent, how much of your case depends

24

upon the proposition that it's just hard to tell, that

25

it's -- it's a multifactored inquiry and that the lawyer
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

sort of has to stop and think at every turn:

2

could this be construed as recommending abuse, or is

3

this just construed as telling clients what they can and

4

can't do?

5

should you do when it's a gray area?

6

Well,

And in some areas it's a gray area, and what

Is that -- does your case depend upon that,

7

which is, I guess, just an issue with the limiting

8

construction proposed by the Solicitor General?

9

MR. BRUNSTAD:

It doesn't turn on that, but

10

that demonstrates the chilling effect.

11

the statute has been to drive conscientious bankruptcy

12

counsel from the practice.

13

difficult to apply; it's often impossible to apply.

14

whole statute turns on whether the debtor, the client or

15

prospective client, is an assisted person, which depends

16

on the relative wealth of the client, which is something

17

very, very difficult to determine at any particular

18

given point in time.

19

Why?

The effect of

Because it's not just

So the lawyer doesn't know:

The

Am I restricted

20

in my speech under 526(a)(4) because that applies or

21

does 526(a)(4) not apply at all because I am not dealing

22

with an assisted person, such that I am under normal

23

State bar rules which requires me to give unfettered

24

advice?

25

And since that is impossible to know without
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

detailed, careful analysis of the relative wealth of the

2

client, the statute is basically impossible to apply.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, if we assume a

4

proper limited construction -- I know you disagree with

5

that, but if we assume that we can limit the statute

6

properly so that it applies just to unethical conduct,

7

then you can't give that advice to anybody, and the fact

8

that assisted persons is a subclass of that is

9

irrelevant.

10

MR. BRUNSTAD:

That would be true, Justice

11

Kennedy, if in fact we could tease out from the abusive

12

conduct, if people could actually understand what

13

"abusive" meant.

14

proscribe?

15

Does that proscribe -- what does it

It's too vague.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes, but that doesn't go

16

to your other point that there's a problem in

17

determining the class of persons.

18

you can't give it to anybody.

19

class of persons is difficult to understand

20

is irrelevant.

21

MR. BRUNSTAD:

If it's unethical,

And the fact that the

Yes, Justice Kennedy, but

22

that assumes that we can do the narrowing construction,

23

I think as Your Honor points out.

24

fundamental problem because the standard the government

25

would like to impose or interlineate in the statute is

And that, again, is a

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

entirely vague.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You want to -- I mean,

3

your first point is -- and we never get to that question

4

because lawyers shouldn't be under this act at all.

5

They shouldn't be labelled debt relief agencies.

6

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

Our

7

point on the statutory construction piece is that the

8

statute is ambiguous and that to avoid the

9

constitutional questions -- actually, avoid two

10

constitutional questions here, the constitutional

11

question under 526(a)(4) and then a separate

12

constitutional question under 528(a)(4) and (b)(2)(B) -

13
14
15
16
17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's only lawyers who are

protected against vague criminal statutes?
MR. BRUNSTAD:

Certainly not, Justice

Scalia, which is why JUSTICE SCALIA:

So then -- so then there is

18

no reason in particular to take lawyers out of it just

19

to make it constitutional.

20

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Well, our argument there,

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's fine.

If you -- if

4

you are letting that argument stand on its own, that's a

5

fine argument.

6

that, well then, moreover, if it's applied to attorneys,

7

it's unconstitutional, because if it's applied to

8

anybody it's unconstitutional according to your

9

argument.

10

But don't -- don't bring in the fact

MR. BRUNSTAD:

That is also true, Justice

Scalia, because we do make a substantial overbreadth

argument.

The statute is substantially overbroad.

So doesn't the

term "provide legal representation" include a lawyer?

2

MR. BRUNSTAD:

The problem, Justice Breyer,

3

is that I think when Your Honor was quoting from section

4

101(4A), Your Honor took out a whole lot of information

5

that goes between the word "bankruptcy assistance" and

6

"legal representation."

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes; they include other

people besides lawyers.

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Not only that, but I think

that that language is inherently ambiguous.

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Well, not just other people,

but what it looks like, is it looks like what Congress

was getting at was people who provide things like what

attorneys provide.

5

Now, there are a whole host of problems with

6

including attorneys within the definition of "debt

7

relief agency."

8

to the purpose of what Congress seemed to be getting at.

9

It leads to anomalous results.

10

I mean, it's counter -- it's contrary

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It does various things.
How is it any different

11

from including lawyers within the category "debt

collectors," which lawyers objected to in this Court

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

Congress repealed the exclusion, so a clear signal to

4

to signal exactly the opposite of the Heintz case.

5

So we have a very ambiguous legislative

history that seems to give us a contrary signal.

to underscore not only would the constitutional

Yes, Your Honor.

I think

10

it's the same as the Cincinnati case, where in fact

11

there was no obligation that the handbills that were

12

being distributed were any way deceptive or misleading.

13

That's the same situation here.

14
15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The district court I -- I have scoured the

It's not a disputed factual question.
There is no dispute, and the district court

Petitioners' advertising is deceptive or untruthful in

any way.

that Congress was trying to target.

MR. BRUNSTAD:

The problem, Justice

Sotomayor, is that that statement inherently is

5

misleading.

6

lawyers, bankruptcy lawyers or just lawyers in general,

7

8

9

it's misleading.

10

When lawyers -- when clients look for

It conveys no meaningful information.

In fact,

What does that mean?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They don't want to be -

11

lawyers don't want to be called debt collectors either,

12

and in this, the Fair Debt Collection Act, it says

13

that -- that communication must say the communication is

14

from a debt collector, except that formal pleadings are

15

not -- you don't have to identify.

16

that -- that would be a harder thing for a lawyer to do,

17

to identify herself in an advertisement as, I am a debt

18

collector, than I am a debt relief agency.

19

MR. BRUNSTAD:

It seems to me that

Yes, but the debt collection

20

statute doesn't require that in advertising.

It

21

requires that in letters and things like that that go to

22

other parties where you are actually trying to help

23

collect the debt.

24

lawyer is making, for example, and a disclosure that's

25

required.

So it's a communication that the

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

relief agency" conveys no meaningful information to the

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the provision

that says the directors, employees, are not included?

3

MR. JAY:

As I understand Petitioners'

4

argument about that provision, it is that Congress would

5

surely have made an exception for partners as well had

6

it intended to include attorneys.

7

a multi-step chain of reasoning that breaks down at each

8

step.

9

We think that that is

Congress made an exception from the

10

definition of "debt relief agencies" for officers and

employees of the business that is itself a debt relief

agency.

15

Partnerships, of course, have employees as

I suppose an individual who provides the

us anything that would derogate from the plain meaning

commonplace of partnership law.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

The

What he -- what I think his

15

argument is, as I understand it, is if you look at the

16

definition of "bankruptcy assistance," you will see

17

there are seven different things that a person could do

18

and fall within that definition.

19

things are probably provided by the kinds of agencies

20

you see advertised on television, which say:

21

help you with your debts.

22

lawyers.

23

And all of those seven

We will

And they probably aren't

And, so, if you look at the six of the seven

24

things, it's clear that all of those are provided by

25

those television companies.

And the seventh is simply

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

added in, namely the providing legal representation, to

2

be a catch-all to be sure that if one of those companies

3

actually does something that is legal representation,

4

even though they are not lawyers, they are caught, too.

5

So he is saying, read the whole paragraph

6

and then you will see they are after the companies that

7

appear on television and they're not after lawyers.

8

then he says that's the history of the bill, and so

9

forth and so on.

10

And

Okay.

Now, that's the argument, and so it isn't -

11

can't quite be brushed off as quickly, I think, as you

did.

that's the natural reading of that phrase.

11

Petitioners have suggested that this is an attempt to

12

catch the unauthorized practice of law.

13

neither the plain meaning nor the legislative record

14

suggests that people who are not lawyers were actually

accompanying the 1999 version of the bill, which had

And in the House report

That is page 120 of House Report 106-123.
So I think that amply refutes the point

about the drafting history.

9

But in any event, if the Court were to look

10

at legislative history, we think that the provisions of

11

the 2005 House report accompanying the bill that

actually was enacted are the most probative, and we've

assets that would otherwise end up in the hands of the

22

debtors.

23

MR. JAY:

I suppose that, you know, there

24

might be a fact question about whether a particular wink

25

and nod communication between an attorney and client
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

were in fact advice to engage in the transaction, that's

2

prohibited under the Bankruptcy Code, the fraudulent or

3

abusive transaction.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if -- what if

5

the lawyer said:

I can't give you advice in

6

contemplation of bankruptcy, but here's the Solicitor

7

General's brief, read that.

8

(Laughter.)

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And a reasonable -

10

my point is a reasonable person reading the brief would

11

say, well, the reason he can't give me advice is because

12

that might cause me to do something that would defraud

13

the debtors, so I'm going to buy the ticket.

14

MR. JAY:

Well, if -- if that debtor reads

15

our brief, that debtor will also see that there are

16

serious consequences for the debtor himself, which is

17

precisely why Congress passed this statute providing for

18

relief for the debtor against the attorney who provides

19

this unethical or abusive advice.

20

An attorney -- sorry.

A client who incurs

21

additional debt intending to defraud the creditor may

22

not be able to obtain a discharge of that debt and

23

indeed may not be able to obtain a discharge in

24

bankruptcy at all.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Well, that's one of

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the things I'm concerned about your limiting

2

construction, "intending to defraud the debtor."

3

if the person takes a trip to Tahiti every November?

4

They've always done it.

5

defraud the debtor.

6

always done.

7

would be -- that would be okay?

8

MR. JAY:

9

What

They are not intending to

They are just doing what they have

So an attorney that gives that advice,

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think

the Culver case, a -- a disciplinary case that we

10

referred to in our brief, is a good illustration of

11

this.

12

a general matter.

Fraud turns on the defrauder's intent as a -- as

13

And when someone -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if -- so if the

14

lawyer said that, I can't give you advice in

15

contemplation of bankruptcy, but I can tell you that

16

fraud turns on the debtor's intent?

17

MR. JAY:

Well, again, Mr. Chief Justice, I

18

-- I don't think that that would be advice to incur the

19

additional debt.

20

debtor who read our brief or who informed himself with

21

these hints that you're positing the attorney giving, I

22

don't think that the debtor would take the step of -- of

23

incurring the additional debt, precisely because there

24

are consequences for the debtor, and it's -- it's a

25

grave risk.

And I don't think that the -- that a

That's precisely why Congress prohibited 39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

prohibited this form of -

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, but the whole

3

point is that the attorney could be providing advice

4

that would steer the debtor away from doing anything

5

wrong.

6

oh, no, no, no, no; you are trying to tell him it's okay

7

to take the trip to Tahiti.

8

trip to Tahiti so long as your intent is not to defraud

9

the debtor -- correct advice that could be read as

And yet the other -- the government would say,

If he says you can take the

10

telling the debtor not to do anything wrong or could be

11

read as giving the debtor a little, as you say, a wink

12

and a nod and saying, you know, what do you intend to

13

do?

14

not to defraud the debtors.

And he says, oh, I just intend to go on vacation,

15

MR. JAY:

I think, Your Honor, subject to

16

some kind of situations of willful blindness, that the

17

attorney in that situation would not be read by any

18

factfinder to have advised a -- to have advised her

19

client to incur additional debt in contemplation of

20

bankruptcy.

21
22
23

And it is -- it is that that is the
statutory touchstone.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, let's take some of

24

the examples that were in the amicus brief.

25

was the debtor is just told by her doctor that she has a
40
Alderson Reporting Company

One of them

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

serious cancer that needs operation and radiation, and

2

she is at the end of the line on resources.

3

trade tools, which she could sell to get some money, but

4

then she won't be able to carry on her business.

5

she could also borrow money, but incurring that debt -

6

since she's on the brink of the bankruptcy, she's

7

incurring the debt knowing that she's on the brink of

8

bankruptcy.

9

And

Could the lawyer say, you don't have to sell

10

your -- the lawyer could say:

11

That wouldn't be a problem.

12

incur the debt?

13
14

She has her

MR. JAY:

Sell your equipment.
But could the lawyer say,

I think the lawyer under a number

of circumstances could say incur the debt.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Precisely -

Well, take this

16

circumstance.

There is no other -- the person is on a

17

brink of bankruptcy, has no resources, can get money by

18

selling assets or by borrowing.

19

MR. JAY:

Well, if I may, Justice Ginsburg,

20

the hypothetical doesn't state how she's going to borrow

21

the money.

22

equity line of credit and she borrows against that home

23

equity line of credit, it's a secured loan that is not

24

going to be discharged in a Chapter 7 proceeding, I

25

think that that's unobjectionable under our reading of

So for example, if she has an open home

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the statute.

2

not an abuse of the bankruptcy system.

3
4

It's not -- it's not abusive, because it's

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
a home equity loan.

5

Suppose she doesn't have

Suppose she's a renter?

MR. JAY:

Well, the two -- the two scenarios

6

that our view -- that in our view are covered by the

7

statute are taking on debt in an attempt to abuse the

8

bankruptcy system or to defraud the creditor.

9

-- even someone without -- without a home equity loan, a

And even

10

home equity line of credit, can take on additional debt

11

without intending to defraud the creditor simply by -

12

by intending to repay it.

13

And that is illustrated in the Culver case,

14

in which the attorney had advised the client to take on

15

additional debt, to -- indeed, he gave her a credit card

16

application and said, get some more cash advances.

17

she said:

18

And he said:

19

bankruptcy; you won't have to repay a penny of it.

20

the Court of Appeals of Maryland explained that that was

21

unethical advice under the Rule 1.2(d), the model rule

22

that applies in just about every jurisdiction.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

I don't want to take on this additional debt.
Don't worry, I will represent you in
And

You can come up with

24

your own hypotheticals that are a lot easier from your

25

point of view, and Justice Ginsburg has been suggesting
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

some that are much more difficult because they depend on

2

particular facts.

3

to me that a lawyer trying to give correct, legal,

4

ethical advice has got to pause before every sentence

5

and think, oh, is this going to be construed in

6

violation of subsection (a)(4)?

7

MR. JAY:

And under your construction it seems

I don't think so, Mr. Chief

8

Justice, and I'm certainly not attempting to fight

9

Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical.

I'm attempting to

10

illustrate that -- that the aspect of the statute that

11

prohibits advice to defraud creditors, you know, will

12

turn on, among other things, whether there is any intent

13

to repay the debt.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Isn't something in

15

contemplation of bankruptcy done only -- isn't something

16

done in contemplation of bankruptcy only if it is done

17

because of the anticipation of filing a bankruptcy

18

petition?

19

debt in order to obtain life-saving treatment, that is

20

not done in contemplation of bankruptcy; it's not done

21

because of the bankruptcy.

22

an emergency that requires immediate expenditures.

23

So that if -- if a person takes on additional

MR. JAY:

It's done because there is

I think that that's right, Justice

24

Alito, that in that hypothetical there is no -- the mere

25

-- the mere fact that the bankruptcy may be looming,
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

even in the hypothetical, is not the animating cause.

2

And the Court has -

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If indeed "in contemplation

4

of bankruptcy" means, as -- as you argue, that it has to

5

be for the purpose of abusing the Bankruptcy Code -

6

right?

7

arguments irrelevant, because it would be illegal

8

anyway, wouldn't it?

9

MR. JAY:

If that's true, then aren't all these vagueness

10

Well -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So even without this

11

statute, the lawyer would have to worry about -- about

12

whether he's doing something that is unlawful.

13

MR. JAY:

The two prongs of -- of our

14

reading of the statute, that's right, Justice Scalia,

15

are to abuse the Bankruptcy Code or to -- or to defraud

16

creditors.

17

The fraud of course is illegal CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But the point is you

18

don't know.

Of course you can't give advice to do

19

something illegal.

20

the questions have been suggesting that it's hard to

21

know whether it's illegal.

22

on the debtor's intent.

23

and said, can I do this, and it depends on his intent,

24

as a lawyer I would want to say:

25

are doing it.

But I -- I would think that some of

You yourself say it depends

So if a client came in to me

It depends on why you

But if -- but that I think could be
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

construed as being -- giving advice in contemplation of

2

bankruptcy.

3

MR. JAY:

But precisely because, Mr. Chief

4

Justice, the definition of fraud turns on the defendant

5

or the fraudulent actor's intent, that's true under

6

present law, under Rule 1.2(d) which prohibits all

7

attorneys from counseling their clients to commit

8

fraudulent acts.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The lawyer runs that risk

10

anyway, whether this statute applies or not.

11

he has to decide whether what he is doing is a fraud on

12

creditors.

13

MR. JAY:

He has -

Or an abuse of the Bankruptcy

14

Code.

And as Justice Ginsburg pointed out in

15

Mr. Brunstad's argument, that is something that the

16

attorney already must be familiar with under Section

17

707(b) and must certify in filing any Chapter 7

18

bankruptcy that in -- after the attorney's professional

19

investigation, that the granting of relief would not be

20

an abuse of the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

21

Attorneys are -- are making that

22

certification every day when they are filing for Chapter

23

7 bankruptcies.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This is a regulation

of the attorney-client relationship to pursue an
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

unrelated substantive objective.

2

that debtors don't do something and you think, well, the

3

way -- it's not enough to tell debtors, don't do this.

4

You're going to say:

5

lawyers tell them as a way of pursuing an unrelated

6

objective.

7

MR. JAY:

You want to ensure

We are going to regulate what

I don't think it's unrelated,

8

Mr. Chief Justice.

The objective is in many -- in some

9

instances criminal and in other instances it is

10

prohibited by the Bankruptcy Code.

11

that -

And the reason

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the objective

13

is criminal; that doesn't mean it is not being

14

indirectly enforced by interfering with the

15

attorney-client relationship.

16

MR. JAY:

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- or affecting the

18
19

Well, it is certainly -

attorney-client relationship.
MR. JAY:

It is certainly true,

20

Mr. Chief Justice, that the attorney is the

21

sophisticated player here.

22

the repeat player, and it is the attorney who, by being

23

made subject to this statute, is -

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

It is the attorney who is

Yes, it's a good way

to enforce it, to tell people you can't get legal advice
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

about it.
What if a State thinks that there are too

3

many punitive damage awards, that they are out of

4

control, and so it passes a law saying lawyers may not

5

tell their clients that they can get -- they can seek

6

punitive damages?

7
8
9

MR. JAY:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, seeking

punitive damages is not illegal CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, if it's done

10

with the purpose of fraud, it is.

11

I'm really -- I really wasn't -- it really wasn't

12

malicious conduct, I know that, or whatever the standard

13

is for punitive damages, then it's illegal, just like

14

here if you incur debt to defraud your debtors it's

15

illegal, but if you don't it's not.

16

MR. JAY:

If you think, well,

Well, I think that the restriction

17

that you're positing is that advice ever to seek

18

punitive damages is -- is going to be -

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, no, no, no, no.

20

Only if it's -- you know, it says you can't give that

21

advice in contemplation of filing a lawsuit.

22

MR. JAY:

Well, no.

That would, of course,

23

would be outside the bankruptcy context, and we are

24

relying in part here on -- both on the avoidance

25

doctrine and on the meaning that "in contemplation of
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

bankruptcy" has had for a long time.

2

But -- but to answer your question, I think

3

that, if there is actually a tie between -- so that

4

sounds exactly to me like a prohibition saying to the

5

lawyer, don't file complaints for punitive damages that

6

aren't supported just under the normal Rule 11 evidence

7

standard.

8

impermissible attempt to -

9

And I don't think that that is an

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no, no.

It's a

10

difference between filing, because there the lawyer

11

signs the -- signs the complaint.

12

the client.

13

It's giving advice to

And the -- I guess what I would see as the

14

parallel is that it's an objective outside the

15

attorney-client relationship.

16

can't charge more than 50 percent contingent fee or -

17

or whatever -- you know, designed to regulate the

18

client -- protect the client.

It's not like saying, you

19

It's -- it's a totally extraneous objective.

20

MR. JAY:

Well, here, I don't think -- I

21

don't think it's an extraneous objective.

22

misunderstanding how you -- how the Court is meaning

23

extraneous.

24
25

Perhaps I am

The -- here, the advice is the motivating
cause in some of these instances of the -- of the debtor
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

taking the step that's going to lead to actual harm to

2

the debtor.

3

That's why Congress provided that the remedy

4

for a violation of this is either an injunctive action

5

by a government official, the U.S. trustee or by the

6

Court or State attorney general, or actual damages paid

7

to the debtor who has suffered harm from the unethical

8

or abuse of advice given to him or her by the attorney.

9

So I think that saying that -- that it's

10

extraneous to the attorney-client relationship, I think

11

that's not the statute that -- that Congress enacted

12

here.

13

It enacted a statute that protects the

14

client from improper, unethical, abusive, or even

15

criminal -- criminally fraudulent advice by the

16

attorney.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

One thing that lawyers

18

who render services for money want -- is to be sure that

19

they will get paid, and one part of this provision, this

20

526(a)(4), talks about incurring debt to pay an attorney

21

for representing the debtor.

22
23
24
25

So what can a lawyer say safely about the
lawyer's getting paid?
MR. JAY:

Well, I would like to note, if I

may, Justice Ginsburg, that we don't think that that is
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

properly part of this challenge.

2

will be happy to answer the question, but the court of

3

appeals struck down this statute, and it said, nine

4

times, that it was talking about the portion of the

5

statute referring to in contemplation of bankruptcy.

6

I will be happy -- I

And the to pay an attorney provision was not

7

addressed in the Petitioner's brief in the court of

8

appeals or in their brief in opposition to our cert

9

position, so we don't -- we don't think it's properly

10
11

here -- it hasn't been addressed.
But to -- to answer your question, the

12

statute says not -- and this part of the statute is on

13

page 5a of the appendix to our brief -- "to advise an

14

assisted person to incur more debt to pay an attorney or

15

bankruptcy petition preparer."

16

So advising the client -- you know, that the

17

client ought to pay the fee -- you know, here's my bill,

18

my fee is due on day X, that simply doesn't come within

19

the terms of the statute.

20

to pay the attorney.

It's only to incur more debt

21

And the situation that we think Congress is

22

getting at is the circumstance where the attorney wants

23

to be paid up-front, again, like in the Culver case, the

24

attorney wants his client to take out a cash advance

25

from the credit card company, knowing -- and to give
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that money to the attorney to pay his fee, precisely

2

because the debt's going to be -- the unsecured debt to

3

the credit card company is going to be discharged in

4

bankruptcy.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's -- that's the

6

clear case.

7

attorney his or her financial state.

8

9

says, "I need it by Friday."

10

How about the person comes in, shows the
There is no money

The attorney simply gives a bill and

No self-respecting person would believe that

11

the individual is going to pay that bill without

12

borrowing money from somewhere, if you have looked at

13

their financial statement and there is no money to be

14

had.

15

there?

16

Would the attorney have violated the statute

MR. JAY:

I don't think so, Justice

17

Sotomayor, precisely because the attorney -- the

18

attorney still hasn't issued the advice to incur more

19

debt.

20

opportunity -- or the option of not paying the fee and

21

carrying it -- carrying it forward into bankruptcy.

22

I mean, the client, of course, also has the

So, in any event, we don't think that that

23

provision can -- can be the basis for a holding that the

24

other provision about in contemplation of bankruptcy is

25

substantially overbroad, which is what the court of
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

appeals held here.

2
3

If I may, unless the Court has further
questions on -

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Just one.

So,

5

basically, your bottom line is any advice to incur debt

6

to pay an attorney is illegal?

7

MR. JAY:

To incur more debt to pay an

8

attorney, I think -- I think that is the import of the

9

statute, and that's because Congress recognized that

10

there is an incentive for attorneys to put pressure on

11

their clients to -- to favor the attorney as creditor,

12

to, essentially, treat the attorney as a creditor in a

13

better position than other creditors.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Perhaps I am being -

15

not quite understanding you.

16

more debt, that is going to always be additional, if the

17

advice is to incur it.

18

to more that I am missing?

19

MR. JAY:

You are underscoring the

So what meaning are you giving

Well, in some of the examples that

20

have come up in the briefing in this case -- you know, a

21

refinancing transaction, for example -- you know, or a

22

sale -- sale of the house and replacing it with a

23

rental.

24
25

exactly.

We don't think that that is more debt.
JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't how this works

I'm not an expert.

I thought that, when

52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

someone goes bankrupt, that one of the things you ask

2

the bankruptcy judge for is permission to pay for

3

ongoing expenses, and that would include an attorney's

4

fee.

Otherwise, people could never be represented.

5
6

MR. JAY:

It's true that the court can

authorize -

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

incentive here?

9

ordinary procedure.

10

Well, so why is there some

All the attorney has to do is follow

MR. JAY:

Precisely because, Justice Breyer,

11

different standards apply to the -- to payments made to

12

the attorney before the bankruptcy commences and

13

payments made to the attorney after the bankruptcy

14

commences.

15

It's a -- the standard of scrutiny after the

16

bankruptcy commences is a -- is a bit more searching

17

under Section 330.

18

If the Court has no further questions on

19

Section 526, I do want to address Section 528, the -

20

the advertising disclosure requirements.

21

think that, as Justice Sotomayor brought out in her

22

exchange with Mr. Brunstad, there is no evidence in this

23

case pertaining to the particular advertisements that

24

petitioners want to run.

25

And, there, we

They simply say, on pages 38 and 39 of the

2

to continue to advertise.

3

their content.

4

judgment in the district court on the theory that this

5

statute is unconstitutional.

6

There is no allegation about

And they sought and were granted summary

And so to the extent that it's anything

7

other than a facial challenge, it's an as-applied

8

challenge, as applied, essentially, to any attorney or,

9

indeed, anyone who wants to run these advertisements.

10

We think that, as I understand the gravamen

11

of Petitioners' argument, is that the two-sentence

12

suggested text is incorrect, that it's -- that it's

13

misleading because it's wrong.

14

And the basis for that is saying that some

15

people who are debt relief agencies don't help people

16

file for bankruptcy relief under the Bankruptcy Code.

17

That is not correct.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

But isn't it misleading for

19

an attorney to say, I'm a -- I'm a debt relief agency?

20

Nobody is going to know what a debt relief agency is,

21

unless they are familiar with this statute.

22

MR. JAY:

Well -

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

A perspective client looks

24

at that, and they say, well, I don't want a debt relief

25

agency, I want a lawyer.
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. JAY:

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

3

MR. JAY:

4

Well That's misleading.

Four points on that, Justice

Alito.

5

First, the advertisement can and indeed, I'm

6

sure always will, say that the advertiser is a lawyer.

7

Nothing forbids the advertisement from saying that.

8

There is no restriction on what content goes in the ad,

9

only that it include this is disclaimer.

10

Second, the term "debt relief agency" is a

11

new one.

12

because it includes -- it includes attorneys; it

13

includes bankruptcy petition preparers.

14

you know, they had to come up with an amalgamated term

15

We think

But I do want to turn back to why it's not

7

correct to say that a debt relief agency would ever not

8

-- not help people file for bankruptcy relief under the

9

Bankruptcy Code.

That is because, as I understand

10

Petitioners' argument, it's that an assisted person

11

might be a creditor.

That is not correct.

12

The definition of "assisted person" turns on

13

having nonexempt property in excess of a certain amount.

14

Under section 522(l) of the Bankruptcy Code, and indeed

15

under this Court's decision in Owen v. Owen, there is no

16

exempt property until there is a filing for bankruptcy

17

and an assembly of the bankruptcy estate and a filing by

18

the debtor, or someone on the debtor's behalf, filing

19

schedules that specify what property the debtor has and

20

which exemptions the debtor chooses to claim.

23

don't think a creditor could be an assisted person.

Well, first, Justice Sotomayor,
