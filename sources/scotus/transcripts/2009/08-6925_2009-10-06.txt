ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA CALL

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MS. CALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Mr. Johnson's conviction for battery in the

11

State of Florida can be sustained by the slightest

12

contact.

13

violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act.

14

violent felony means one that has as an element the use,

15

attempted use, or threatened use of physical force

16

against the person of another.

17

the same as physical force.

Such a conviction does not qualify as a

18

A

Physical contact is not

Physical force in this context means

19

something more than a mere quantum of physical contact,

20

and it requires violent aggression that is likely to

21

cause physical injury.

22

rules of statutory construction in this Court's

23

precedents.

24

these principles to find that physical force means

25

something more than de minimis contact.

This conclusion is guided by the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that's -- you say

2

that's Federal law.

3

contra what Florida held in the Hearns case, a State had

4

typed a battery statute as a crime of violence?

5

Would it make a difference if,

MS. CALL:

Yes, Your Honor.

If the State

6

statute required that the offender admit the use of

7

force as part of the elements of his prior offense -

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

No, no, no.

the -- it's exactly the statute Florida has.

It's exactly
And

10

somebody has a plea, and we don't know from the record

11

what the conduct was.

12

says, our battery statute for our State law purposes is

13

a crime of violence; therefore, for our State law

14

enhancements the person who pleads guilty to a battery

15

offense will be deemed one who has committed a crime of

16

violence, if that's the State law.

17

MS. CALL:

But the State, unlike Florida,

Then -- no, Your Honor, I'm

18

sorry.

Then the mere fact that the State found that it

19

qualified under its own recidivist statute would not

20

bind the Federal court.

21

binding is the proposition that it found the elements of

22

a battery offense and the -- the ACC looks to those

23

elements to determine whether it is a violent felony.

24

Congress didn't say that it -- the offender had to have

25

conduct that involved the use of physical force, but a

Why we say that Hearns is

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

prior that had as an element the use.

2

So the fact that the State statute may

3

qualify under its State recidivism wouldn't be the same

4

determination that it didn't have as an element the use

5

of force.

6

Here JUSTICE BREYER:

But what -- what -- before

7

we can even get into this, I think we have to decide if

8

those words "striking or touching" describe one crime or

9

two.

And what we said in Chambers is that the nature of

10

the behavior that likely underlies a statutory phrase

11

matters in this respect.

12

different things covered by one statute in James or

13

Chambers, two of them, failing to return from a furlough

14

and failing to return from work in day release, seem to

15

me quite possibly to describe one thing, not two.

16

If you think of the seven

Now, how do we know that striking or

17

touching describes two things?

ever been charged separately.

21

hundreds.

24
25

I couldn't find any
I couldn't

And they looked at

So -- so why do we think it's two crimes,
rather than just one called "striking or touching"?
MS. CALL:

Your Honor, two reasons.

First,

the face of the statute itself has "or," so it doesn't

JUSTICE BREYER:

It does, too, in Chambers.

It's "not returning from furlough or not returning from

4

behavior is the same.

7

separate things.

You know, and I'd -- I would say the
It's not like burglary of a

8

MS. CALL:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

Those are two

Yes.
Here, why do you think they

are two separate things?

11

MS. CALL:

Your Honor, because Hearns, the

12

Florida State Supreme Court decision, described them as

13

three separate offenses and spelled out that this

14

statute could be violated and it said by:

15

touching someone intentionally and against their will;

16

second, by striking; or third, by causing bodily harm.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

First,

If they are separate

18

things, what is the evidence?

19

question.

20

enough to rise under the -- to fall within the Federal

21

statute?

22

no.

23

There is a legal

You say the touching.

Spitting, is that

Suppose I agree with you on that; the answer's

How do I know whether touching as applied in

24

Florida as a separate matter in the mine run of cases,

25

involves spitting or involves something that causes far
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

more serious harm?

2

How do I know?

MS. CALL:

Your Honor, you would apply first

3

the plain language of the statute, and "to touch" means

4

the slightest contact, as the courts have held.

5

pages 41 to 42 we spelled out the offenses of spitting,

6

making slight contact, that justified a battery

7

conviction.

8

else or the legislature wouldn't have included both

9

types of conduct within the battery provision.

10
11

14

"Strike" obviously has to mean something

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This -- this statute is a

misdemeanor statute, isn't it?

12
13

At

MS. CALL:

For a first offense, yes, Your

Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yeah.

And the only reason

15

what happened here was elevated to a felony was that he

16

had a prior offense.

17

MS. CALL:

Yes, Your Honor.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So it's understandable that

19

the slightest touch could -- could constitute a

20

misdemeanor.

21

MS. CALL:

Your Honor, the problem with

22

saying that just because it's a felony, therefore it

23

can't be considered is that the statute first describes

24

the prohibited conduct and says that the conduct is in

25

the first subparagraph, the penalty is in the second.
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

So the very same conduct is necessary for either a

2

felony or a misdemeanor, and essentially no force times

3

two is still zero.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, ACCA uses the words

5

"physical force," and any touching involves some

6

physical force.

7

than the minimum physical force is necessary in order to

8

fall within the Federal statute?

9

MS. CALL:

Now, how do we determine how much more

Your Honor, it is a qualitative

10

line that sentencing judges would have to make, like all

11

of the other difficult decisions that they're called on

12

to make in the sentencing guidelines in these 3553

13

factors.

14

conduct just like the Begay test, that it would be

15

physical force of a kind that is violent and aggressive

16

and likely to cause injury.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

We've asserted as a proposed test that it be

Well, there -- most -- this

18

statute actually, we looked into it and it seems to be

19

used, particularly the touching part, also to cover

20

unwelcome physical, sexual advances.

21

to consider such matters to have involved force of

22

exactly the kind that the Federal statute is aimed at.

23

And there was no striking, but there was in fact use of

24

harmful force, touching.

25

And it's not hard

That was serious.

Now, how do we know which is more normally
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the case when this statute is used in its touching

2

respect?

3

MS. CALL:

Your Honor, the government has

4

cited a footnote of 6,000 convictions, and there is no

5

way to know of those convictions whether they were

6

charged as to touch, to strike, or to cause bodily harm.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But we don't have to know

8

what's more normal anyway, do we?

9

MS. CALL:

10

No, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If -- if any conviction is

11

possible under the element of the crime to touch, when

12

there is simply slight physical force, your argument

13

still stands, right?

14

MS. CALL:

Yes, Your Honor.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

I would say that's

16

certainly wrong under our cases.

17

thought that the reason that burglary, for example, is a

18

violent crime is not because in every instance there is

19

a risk of physical harm, because in the mine run of

20

instances there is a risk of physical harm, and I

21

thought we said that in at least three cases.

22

MS. CALL:

I mean, I would have

Yes, Your Honor, as to looking to

23

both the enumerated offenses and those that fall in the

25

talk about conduct and it does not refer to an ordinary

The first prong of the ACC, though, does not

2

therefore it is directed to looking at a particular

3

Florida State statute rather than a generic battery or

4

how battery might ordinarily -

5

It says an offense that has as an element.

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

I know, but an element -

6

you mean we should interpret "element" in the first part

7

of this in a radically different way than we have

8

interrupted equivalent words in the second part, and we

9

should say that burglary -- in other words, assault

10

or -- or -- in other words, unless in every case of

11

prosecution there is going to be force actually applied

12

or something like that, that it doesn't fall within one?

13

I'm surprised at it.

14

What would be the argument for doing that, which would

15

be totally different than we have handled the other one?

16

MS. CALL:

I mean, I guess it's possible.

Your Honor, the reason why is

17

that Congress was directing in the first prong those

18

crimes that were directed against persons and would be

19

defined by their elements.

20

did list out four enumerated offenses that they thought

21

were committed, A, by career criminals, and, B, that

22

created that substantial risk.

23

does not talk about risk to others.

24

offender's conduct and an elements-based test.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

In the second prong Congress

In the first part it
It's that

If there were a State
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

statute that made it a battery to engage in offensive

2

and unwelcome sexual touching, your argument would be

3

that that would not fall within the first prong of ACCA,

4

because there is not a -- it's not likely to cause a

5

physical injury?

6

MS. CALL:

Yes, Your Honor.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

8

MS. CALL:

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is that right?

Yes, Your Honor.

Because -

If there was a statute that

10

said -- in the old days I'm told people used to throw

11

the contents of chamber pots out the window.

12

were a -- a State statute that said it is a crime to

13

dump the contents of a chamber pot on somebody's head,

14

you would say that's -- that doesn't fall within the

15

first prong of ACCA?

16
17

MS. CALL:

Yes, Your Honor, I would say that

that does not qualify under the first prong.

18
19

If there

JUSTICE ALITO:

Even -- those are classic

batteries -

20

MS. CALL:

Yes, Your Honor.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- and the language of the

22

first prong of ACCA really tracks the language of the

23

common law crime of battery?

MS. CALL:

Your Honor, it does because it

4

5

And we were not arguing that that offender who

So -- so what about an

6

assault?

7

mean, a statute for assault -- I guess you could assault

8

somebody by threatening to throw a marshmallow at them.

9

MS. CALL:

10
11

Yes, Your Honor.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

Now, assault is out

of the statute.

12
13

I guess, using a law school hypothetical, I

MS. CALL:

Your Honor, again, it depends on

each particular statute and its elements.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no.

But I mean, on

15

your definition, as you and Justice Scalia were

16

suggesting, because it is conceivable that you could

17

assault somebody by threatening to throw a marshmallow,

18

that means assault is no longer a crime of violence, and

19

that can't be right.

20

MS. CALL:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

Well, Your Honor -

You don't have to touch somebody for an assault.

23

MS. CALL:

Correct.
You can just threaten

somebody.

Of course it's right.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Assault is not a crime of

violence; it's not a use of force.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Two responses to that, Your

Honor.

11

would violate the categorical approach of saying we're

12

not looking at what each offender might have done in any

13

particular case, but what are the elements that he

14

necessarily admitted.

15

would qualify as a violent felony because the Florida

16

statute defines it as an offer to do violence coupled

17

The first is, looking at the underlying facts

Your Honor, yes, if it has as an

element the use of force.

And that -

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MS. CALL:

But it didn't -

Yes, but under the ACCA, which is

24

one of the phrases that the government elides out of its

25

analysis, it's not simply the actual use of force, but
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

an attempted or threatened use of force.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can I ask you something?

3

In your definition, you appear to hinge it on the fact

4

that the force used has to cause injury of some type,

5

that.

That appears to be the only definition you can

6

give.

But the use of physical force means just the use

7

of force, strong force, violent force, aggressive force,

8

but it doesn't mean that it necessarily has to cause

9

injury.

10

Would my rearing back and slapping you?

In

11

those instances slapping doesn't cause physical injury

12

as that term is defined in the common law, which is an

13

injury of lasting effect.

You may have some redness for

14

a second, but that's all.

Would that qualify as a crime

15

of violence?

16

MS. CALL:

Your Honor, some of these

17

questions will be difficult lines for the court -- a

18

sentencing court to draw.

19

definition that violent felony, the word "violence"

20

encompasses sort of a rough use of force that could lead

21

to injury or is likely to lead to injury, not -

22

We have offered the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, but violence has a

23

broader meaning.

It generally means a strong force or a

24

strong -- physical force generally has some relative

25

degree of -- of impact.

I agree with you, the common
14

definition talks that way.

2

more into it, like physical injury?

3

MS. CALL:

Why should we read something

Your Honor, the Court wouldn't

4

have to, and part of where we drew this from is the

5

Court's language in Begay that indicated that crimes

6

within clause (1) of ACCA are those crimes which are

7

also likely to present a serious risk of potential

8

injury to others.

9
10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Many will, but don't -

serious use of force doesn't necessarily always.

11

MS. CALL:

Yes, Your Honor, and that's why

12

the qualitative line falls somewhere higher than mere

13

contact, which would simply be the standard for Florida

14

battery conviction.

2

another.

3

MS. CALL:

No, Your Honor.

Knowing the

4

added fact of the actual conduct would not answer the

5

question because it is based on the elements.

6

if the prosecutor charged it as to strike, or there was

7

a division -- for example, at page 19 of our reply brief

8

we showed the Fifth Circuit case in Robledo.

9

the exact same Florida statute that is at issue here and

10

said the offender did touch or strike the victim, comma,

11

by striking him with a vehicle.

12

said under the modified categorical approach to look at

13

the charging document and the offender's necessary

14

admission shows that was, in fact, a crime of violence.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

However,

And the Fifth Circuit

Isn't there a separate -- a

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But, besides the

2

misdemeanor battery statute, there are two felony

3

battery statutes in Florida, right?

4

MS. CALL:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6
7

There are.

Two other separate -

And how -- how are they

defined?
MS. CALL:

Your Honor, they add the mens rea

8

of whether or not the battery was intended to cause

9

great bodily harm, permanent disfigurement, or permanent

10

disability; and the other says simply that you committed

11

a battery and did cause -- the higher standards.

12

and, in addition, the misdemeanor battery includes the

13

element of causing bodily harm, and offenders can be

14

charged simply with that provision.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Misdemeanor does?

16

MS. CALL:

Yes, Your Honor.

17

Yes.

But -

The

felony version is to cause great -- great bodily harm.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

MS. CALL:

Right.

And the misdemeanor is to cause

20

bodily harm, which Florida law defines as low as causing

21

a bruise or mark like that.

22

So, if someone were charged with, in State

23

court, a predicate that involved that kind of injury, a

24

prosecutor using his or her discretion could charge

25

under causing bodily harm and -- which showed facts that
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

could support the finding of a violent felony.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What -- what about

3

the government's argument that your interpretation would

4

dramatically limit the reach of this provision of ACCA

5

because of the number of States that define battery in

6

the same way Florida does?

7

MS. CALL:

Your Honor, I think that the

8

government exaggerates the concerns of that because

9

there are statute that both require an admission of the

10

use of force or have that as an alternative that could

11

be prosecuted in the appropriate case.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but Yeah, but it's -

14

it's usually easier just to charge the lowest common

15

denominator, the battery that doesn't necessarily

16

require violent force, and the point -- this was the

17

argument that was accepted in -- in Hayes, that the

18

interpretation, say, advanced by the dissent in that

19

case, would mean that there be a vast number of States

20

that weren't covered.

21
22
23

I mean, presumably, Congress meant to cover
all the States.
MS. CALL:

Yes, Your Honor.

However,

24

because the -- in Hayes, the Court was looking at the

25

"committed by" and whether that was the -- the necessary
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

part of the prior conviction.

2

Here, given the fact that the statute can be

3

charged both in Florida and many other statutes to be

4

included, shows that those cases would -- it would only

5

be a small number of cases that are likely to be

6

affected where -

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You -- you would have to

8

have other States which only have a battery statute that

9

is defined as broadly as this misdemeanor battery

10

statute in Florida.

11

If they have a higher degree of battery,

12

just as Florida does, which is a felony, then, if the -

13

if the prosecutor wants this fellow to be convicted of a

14

violent crime, he -- he could charge him with that -

15

with that higher degree.

16

MS. CALL:

Yes, Your Honor.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Are there any States that

an exception.

That's how we have interpreted 2.

So if we interpret 1 a different way, we are going to

4

take outside the statute the very things that Congress

5

wanted inside; and, if we interpret it the same way, I

6

think we would get to the right result.

7

MS. CALL:

Your Honor, I would have two

8

responses to that.

The first is, in the second prong,

9

Congress used the word "conduct."

And if they had meant

10

conduct to be included in 1 rather than the elemental

11

definition, that would have been a very easy definition.

12

Second, when they talked about the crimes

intended for category 1, they gave the examples of

I certainly

agree that --

JUSTICE BREYER:

You do?

You agree that,

then -- in other words, Section 2 is not about property

crimes that involve force, which is what Congress

15

happened to say nonstop in the legislative history,

which I know isn't read by everyone.

those things that aren't property crimes.

that the legislative history certainly indicates that 1

JUSTICE BREYER:

They wouldn't have to say

codification of common law battery that would include

both touching and more aggressive behavior.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MS. KRUGER:

But all

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The primary definition of violent felony in

11

the Armed Career Criminal Act, as, Justice Alito, you

12

have noted and, Mr. Chief Justice, as you have noted,

13

almost precisely tracks the general definition of the

14

crime of battery; that is, the unlawful application of

15

physical force to the person of another.

Petitioner's primary submission -

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, then why

didn't they say -- why didn't they just say battery, if

19

that's what they meant?

20

clearer than to say physical force against the person.

21

MS. KRUGER:

It's a lot simpler and also

I think it's certainly true,

22

Mr. Chief Justice, that Congress could have defined the

23

category of predicates for the ACCA in that way by

24

listing certain offenses, which would then require the

25

courts to determine what the generic elements of those
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

offenses were, as this Court did with respect to

2

burglary in Taylor.

3

But Congress instead decided to list in its

4

primary definition of violent felony the common element

5

that it thought as a categorical matter indicated a

6

sufficient potential for harm that the crime ought to be

7

singled out as a predicate for ACCA enhancement.

8

that single element was the use of physical force

9

against the person of another.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And

You -- you -- you would

11

have us believe that by "violent felony" in this -- in

12

this statute, Congress meant the threat -- the threat?

is that a threatened use of force is normally considered

25

and normally punished under the criminal law as a crime
27
Alderson Reporting Company

The first

2

noted already in the arguments, it seems awfully

3

unlikely, particularly in light of legislative history

4

of this provision for those Justices who consider such

5

considerations relevant, that Congress meant to exclude

6

the crime of assault.

7

And for the reasons that Justice Breyer has

And again, two responses:

The

14

first is as a practical matter that is not a crime.

criminal threat, there has to be more than simply the

19

There has to -- the defendant has to

But there have been rude

touchings where there is no danger of physical injuries

21

to the person.

22

I understand, for what would be considered a rude

23

touching as opposed to an aggressive use of force that

24

would risk physical injury.

25

There have been prosecutions in Florida,

MS. KRUGER:

That's correct.

There have

4

rude touchings, as a matter of general usage in the

5

common law and in the general definition of battery, do

in fact have as an element the use of physical force.

would pick pocketing be a violent crime if it involves a

Pick pocketing actually doesn't

involve a touching necessarily.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Normally if you -

pocket could get -- could get just the wallet and not

20

touch the person, I'm not sure.

21

MS. KRUGER:

Well, pick pocketing, normally

22

as it is criminalized in most states, does not, in fact,

23

require as an element that the prosecution prove that

24

the -- the defendant touched the victim.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, but you don't prosecute

Well, the clumsy pick pocket

And

6

robbery is precisely the kind of offense that we know

7

that Congress was intending to cover in subsection 1 of

8

the ACCA.

9

it remains, I think, a paradigmatic example of a crime

It was one of the first ACCA predicates, and

10

that has as an element the use of force and is,

therefore, covered under the plain statutory language.

But I think that -

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MS. KRUGER:

thrust of the argument so far has been that if it's

17

possible to commit battery under the common law under

18

the laws of 27 states, including Florida, under Federal

19

law in the way that individual instances doesn't seem to

20

present a serious risk of injury, then it can't possibly

21

be a violent felony.

22

way the Court has interpreted the statute to date that

23

that is simply not the case.

24
25

And I think that we know from the

This Court addressed a very similar argument

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, you see that

2

you don't have the inquiry.

The issue is not whether it

3

causes serious injury or not, the issue is whether the

4

nature of the force used is physical force.

5

you look at the common definition of "physical force" in

6

the dictionary, which your adversaries did very well in

7

their brief, physical force has in its ordinary meaning

8

the use of some strength, of some power, and generally

9

kissing doesn't require that strength or power, touching

And, so, if

10

someone on the shoulder, doesn't.

11

activities are prohibited by this statute if they are

12

unwanted.

13

All of these

So the question is not whether or not they

14

present the risk of physical injury, the issue is

15

whether in all applications or in a substantial number

16

they don't require the use of strength to -- in its

17

application.

18

That's a different question.

MS. KRUGER:

Justice Sotomayor, I think that

19

you are exactly right, that the inquiry that is set out

20

in subsection 1 is simply, does this crime have as an

21

element the use of physical force?

22

Our submission is that every battery under

23

Florida law, under common law and under the laws of 27

24

states and the Federal Government does have an -- as an

element the use of physical force.

5

MS. KRUGER:

Right.

There is some

suggestion in Judge Easterbrook's opinion that that

usage is somehow peculiar to Newtonian physics.

8

fact of the matter is, it is actually a very common

usage in the criminal law.

The

There are a number of

slightest degree.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Suppose we

interpret the statute, the act of the statute as

requiring more force than that, as requiring something

more than spitting.

18

they have made a strong case, that touching is a

separate thing under this statute because that's what

the Florida Supreme Court said, and moreover, there are

prosecutions that seem not to fit within striking.

MS. KRUGER:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

18

think, first of all, it would be a mistake to think that

19

Congress defines the range of ACCA predicate with

20

particular consideration to the ways that hypothetical

21

defendants might -- might commit even quintessentially

22

violent crimes in particular cases.

23

This Court, for example, considered in

24

Taylor v. United States a very similar argument, which

25

was that the statutory reference to burglary ought to be
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

interpreted in a way that would limit it to aggravated

2

burglaries of a certain sort, armed burglaries or

3

burglaries of occupied buildings, in order to make sure

4

that that reference to burglary better fit with

5

Congress's purposes in selecting the worst of the worst.

6

This Court declined that invitation because

7

it decided that Congress's unmodified views of the word

8

"burglary" indicated that Congress meant for that word

9

to take on its ordinary meaning as it was used in the

10

laws of the many states.

11

have recognized that ordinary burglaries can be

12

committed in individual instances in ways that don't

13

seem particularly harmful, by unarmed defenders of

14

unoccupied buildings in remote locations, but that

15

Congress nevertheless made a categorical judgment that

16

burglaries as a whole present sufficient potential for

17

harm that they ought to be covered as ACCA predicates.

18

It said that Congress would

And I think a similar analysis applies here.

19

Congress probably wasn't focused on the least amount of

20

force that it takes to commit the crime of battery, but

21

it was entitled to make a judgment that any battery, any

22

unlawful use of force against another person,

23

categorically presents sufficient potential for harm

24

that -

JUSTICE BREYER:

It might have, but battery

And at that

point, you have to decide, is there an element there of

5

Now, on Justice Scalia's approach, the fact

that there is one conviction for spitting is sufficient

to take it outside the statute.

I think to the extent that, Your Honor, you

are inclined to look to the purposes of this statute,

what Congress would have thought the mind run of cases

reported cases in Florida, we see that the kinds of

crimes that are prosecuted under the touching or

striking prong of that statute are, in fact, quite

harmful.

It's not at all difficult to see why Congress

would have been concerned about these types of crimes,

both because in many instances they involve conduct that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You know, I guess it comes

18

down to whether we think that in -- in B1, Congress was

19

using technical language or Congress was using simply

20

ordinary language, because you are quite right that the

definition of -- of battery covers even the slightest

Congress was using the term in a technical sense, and

2

was not using the term "physical force," "the use of

3

physical force" to mean something more than a mere

4

touching.

5

But that's -- that's basically what we are

6

arguing, isn't it?

7

there, "threatened use of physical" -- "use or

threatened use of physical force," is technical language

common usage.
You -- you would acknowledge that, that in

12

more common usage, no one -- no one would think that if

13

you go over to somebody and point your finger at him on

14

his lapel and say, "Now, you listen to me," that that

15

would be considered the use or threatened use of

16

physical force?

17

MS. KRUGER:

I think it probably is not the

18

way that we ordinarily talk in day-to-day conversation,

19

but it certainly is the way that the law has talked

20

about it for centuries, and I think there is a reason

21

that Congress had in mind the technical definition of

22

battery rather than ordinary parlance, if for no other

23

reason because it tracked so closely the general

24

definition, that technical definition of "battery," when

25

it defines "violent felony" in Subsection 1.

because now that the JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask -- may I ask

this, following up on Justice Scalia's point?

4

any other crimes other than battery that -- that create

5

the same situation where in the first time it is

6

7

felony because it's committed twice?

8

here is conduct that first time is misdemeanor, second

9

time is a felony.

So what we have

Are there any other examples of

10

crimes that fit that category that come within

11

Subparagraph 1?

12

Are there

MS. KRUGER:

I am not sure of the answer to

13

that, Justice Stevens.

I do think that one reason why

14

the misdemeanor versus felony distinction is somewhat

15

unimportant to the interpretation of the "use of

16

physical force" language in this case is that if the

17

same language was deployed first in the "crime of

18

violence" definition of 18 U.S.C. 16, which by its

19

terms, applies to both misdemeanors and felonies, and

20

Congress has of course subsequently used that very same

21

language to define a class of misdemeanor crimes of

22

domestic violence in Section 922(g)(9), we think to the

23

extent that this Court is inclined to interpret the

24

extent of the similar language in the similar statutes

25

in a similar manner, the use of physical force language
39
Alderson Reporting Company

should remain consistent across them.

2

One of the principal vices of Petitioner's

3

arguments is also that it would leave the Federal

4

domestic violence provisions like Section 922(g)(9) with

5

relatively patchwork and haphazard application, which is

6

precisely one of the considerations that motivated this

7

Court's decision just last term in the United States v.

Hayes.

Whether the Court JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there are no

10

provisions that would include domestic violence and the

11

12

MS. KRUGER:

There are -- the range of

13

predicate offenses that can be used for the Section

14

922(g)(9) domestic gun violence prohibition, ordinarily,

15

as this Court recognized in Hayes, encompasses the

16

general assault and battery statutes of the United

17

States.

18

more or less the way that Florida does, to include a

19

range of uses of physical force from the least degree of

20

physical force to very severe beatings, so under

21

Petitioner's reading, it would be impossible to say for

22

sure in more than half of the country that a domestic

23

violence conviction, even a battery conviction that is

just the basis for the court of appeals decision in this

it's not at all unusual for this Court to decide that a

Well So, I mean, I don't know.

Maybe the court of appeals felt -- what they said was,

"if not, then not."

Well, I think it's -- again,

it's difficult to read that piece of loose language in

the Court's opinion as a direct holding, particularly

considering that the court of appeals didn't so much as

cite the language or even the code provision that

relates to the argument.

Poses a risk.

14

MS. KRUGER:

No, I think it would still be

15

consistent with this Court's analysis of subsection (2)

16

in Begay in that battery by touching, if you consider it

17

to be a separate crime, which again I think is a highly

18

contested -

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

And you think drunk driving

20

doesn't present a serious potential risk of physical

21

injury?

22

MS. KRUGER:

No, but what this Court said in

23

Begay was that it doesn't present risks that are similar

24

in degree and kind to the risks that are presented by

25

the enumerated offenses.

And battery, including battery
45

Alderson Reporting Company

risks that are quite similar in degree and kind to the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It is -

Wait, I don't follow

presents a serious risk of potential physical injury.

9

I mean, I understand your argument that

MS. KRUGER:

Well, I think -- first of all,

10

to clear up a misconception, simply because the

11

statutory text covers the slightest touching doesn't

12

mean that it covers only the slightest touching.

13

covers a wide range of degrees of physical force

beginning with the slightest touching and including -

It

Yeah, but your

argument is to try -- is asserting that the slightest

17

physical touching is covered by the statute.

MS. KRUGER:

Right.

And the question before

19

the Court in this case concerns only that question.

20

concerns the proper interpretation of subsection (1).

21

Whether the crime is one that has as an element the use

22

of physical force.

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It

The district court thought

24

that the two were related.

The district court, if it

25

thought a slightest touching was qualified under (1) it
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

was not unreasonable to say that it would also qualify

2

under (2).

3

(1), it seems to me it would follow necessarily that it

4

would also be rejected under (2).

5

But if that argue ment is rejected under

MS. KRUGER:

I'm not entirely sure why that

6

would be true.

7

descriptive matter that most of the crimes that are

8

encompassed by subsection (1) would also qualify under

9

subsection (2).

10

But I do think that it's right as a

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But (2) -- (2) looks to the

11

conduct, it doesn't look to the element of the crime.

12

So you could actually look to the conduct of which the

13

person was convicted, no?

14

MS. KRUGER:

Well, you have to look at the

15

contact that the person was convicted of with respect to

16

the elements of the crime, that is the nature of the

17

category -

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, no, no.

You look to

19

the crime -- under (1), you look to the crime he was

20

convicted of, and if -- if -- if none of its elements

21

require serious physical force, you can say it doesn't

22

qualify under (1), but under (2) if in fact you see the

23

misdemeanor he was convicted of was really whacking

24

somebody really hard, then -- then it could possibly

25

come within -- come under (2).
47
Alderson Reporting Company

MS. KRUGER:

With respect, Justice Scalia, I

2

think that is incorrect.

This Court has made clear that

3

subsection (2) like subsection (1) proceeds by looking

4

at the elements of the offense -

MS. KRUGER:

Just at the elements of the

offense of which the defendant was convicted.

8
9

Just at the elements.

JUSTICE SCALIA:
about 922?

Can I ask you about -

You point to the -- the definition there,

10

the definition in 921.

But that is a definition of the

11

term, misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.

12

the context of defining that term, I'm perfectly willing

13

to believe that the use or attempted use of physical

14

force means even the slightest touching, as -- as

15

battery does.

16

of domestic violence.

And in

You are talking about a misdemeanor crime

17

But what we have before us here is a term -

18

a different term that is being defined and that term is

19

violent felony.

20

that -- that that definition embraces merely the

21

slightest touching.

22

And I find it a lot harder to swallow

MS. KRUGER:

Well, Justice Scalia, I would

23

certainly be inclined to agree with you but it's

24

particularly clear given the text and context of the

25

purposes of section 922(g)(9) that battery ought to be
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

covered by that definition, misdemeanor crime of

2

domestic violence.

3

is also clear under subsection (1) of the ACCA is that

4

the use of force element of the definitional provision

5

is separate from the degree of seriousness with which

6

the State chooses to treat the crime, yet the crime is

7

punished as a felony, and if has as an element the use

8

of physical force, then it qualifies as a violent felony

9

under the ACCA, just as if it is punished as a

But we think that the reason why it

10

misdemeanor, it qualifies as a misdemeanor crime of

11

domestic violence under section 922(g)(9).

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I dare say that Congress in

13

my view probably didn't even contemplate that something

14

which is a misdemeanor could become a violent felony if

15

you did it the second time.

16

MS. KRUGER:

Well -

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Have we ever approved that,

18

by the way, kicking it up to the felony category simply

19

because of recidivism?

20

MS. KRUGER:

Well, the Court in United

21

States v. Rodriguez in analyzing the coordinate

22

provision of the ACCA that covers serious drug offenses

23

said that the felony aspect of that definition is

24

satisfied by a recidivist enhancement.

25

that the conclusion in that case, and it is not disputed
49
Alderson Reporting Company

And we think

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

among the parties, applies with equal force in this case

2

to the proper interpretation of violent felony.

3

But it was certainly true by the time that

4

Congress enacted the ACCA, which the legislative history

5

indicates Congress understood would cover assault

6

crimes, for example, that there were certain kinds of

7

batteries and assaults that, although otherwise may be

8

punished as simple batteries and assaults, as

9

misdemeanors, could be elevated to a felony if for

10

example they were committed against a law enforcement

11

officer.

12

It simply was not unheard of for simple

13

battery to be elevated to a felony under certain

14

circumstances in 1986 Congress enacted the present

15

version of ACCA.

16

Congress -- every indication that we have in both the

17

text, the context, the purpose of the statute and its

18

background suggests that Congress was in fact

19

deliberately tracking the definition of battery when it

20

enacted the primary definition of violent felony in

21

subsection (1).

22

At the end of the day, we think that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, every

23

indication except for the fact that they didn't use the

24

word battery.

25

MS. KRUGER:

Aside from the fact that they
50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

didn't use the word battery.

2

incorporate the general definition of the crime of

3

battery; that is correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

4

Instead they chose to

We think that to the extent that the Court

5

is inclined to restrict the terms of -- that Congress

6

chose to use itself to physical force as only exceeding

7

a certain threshold, to include some batteries and not

8

other batteries, the Court would be setting up a very

9

difficult test for Federal sentencing courts to apply in

10

the real world.

11

Essentially -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

States do it all the time

12

when they have different degrees of battery.

13

Misdemeanor -- felony battery -- they do it all the

14

time.

15

MS. KRUGER:

Well, as the Chief Justice has

16

noted, States don't have quite the same compulsion to

17

sort different factual offenses into different boxes.

18

Prosecutors, as the prosecutor did in this case, can use

19

either of the two alternative prongs of Florida's

20

battery definition to punish what is essentially the

21

same offense, which is the crime of battery, that

22

deserves the same punishment regardless of which prong

23

the prosecutor proceeds under, whether the bodily injury

24

prong or the touching or striking prong.

25

And Petitioner's concession that at least
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Federal sentencing courts could draw distinctions

2

between touches and strikes, may have some resonance in

3

the State of Florida, but has resonance for the rest of

4

the country.

5

don't contain explicit references to striking, but

6

subsume striking within the range of conduct prescribed

7

by their offensive touching prong.

8
9

Most State assault and battery statutes

So it simply wouldn't be possible, in most
cases, for a court to look at the cold record of the

10

underlying State conviction and try to discern exactly

11

how much force was involved in the offense and whether

12

that force satisfied the Petitioner's proposed

13

threshold, whatever it means.

14

At the end of the day, the principal

15

question before the court is one that is, primarily,

16

relevant to the Section 922(g)(9) provision and other

17

federal misdemeanor domestic violence provisions and one

18

that we think, in considering the purposes of those

19

statutes and the very serious dangers that they address,

20

the Court ought to interpret the plain text of the

21

statutes in light of their plain meaning.

that the Eleventh Circuit -- one permissible reading was

that when they indicated that the test was exclusively

3

MS. CALL:

Yes, Your Honor, and the other

4

note I would make is, factually, at page 40 of the joint

7

8

9
10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
MS. CALL:

Thank you.

And, Your Honor, I wanted to note

11

this is not just an academic exercise on noticing what

12

physical force means.

13

Mr. Johnson's prior conviction was a violent felony, it

14

raised his guideline range, from 27 to 33 months, to a

15

mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years.

Absent this one finding of

16

So the danger of including this crime, when

17

the art or criminal act was not designed to include all

18

crimes or all offenders, means that it took all

19

discretion away from the sentencing judge.

20

In ACCA, Congress set a superior high

21

standard requiring three priors on three -- that

22

occurred on three separate occasions, and so looking at

23

this decision, when Mr. Johnson was put inside the box,

24

that tied the judge's hands.

25

If this were not considered a violent
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

felony, the sentencing judge could consider that under

2

the guidelines in the 3553 factors.

3

physical force so broadly is to, in essence, collapse

4

the distinction between those violent offenses that are

5

meant to be included in the Armed Career Criminal Act

6

and those that are not.

7

But to read

Your Honors, I would also note one matter,

8

that physical contact is used in the assault statutes

9

under the Federal Code, so there is a different

10

provision -- a different meaning to physical contact

11

than to physical force, and the physical force, in this

12

definition, is looking at what level and what sort of

13

force Congress intended to require to impose this very

14

high sentencing standard.

15

And this Court had rejected, in Shepard, the

16
