CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We’ll hear argument

next in Case 08-974, Lewis v. The City of Chicago.
Mr. Payton.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN A. PAYTON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. PAYTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
On 11 separate occasions, Chicago used an

12

unlawful cutoff score to determine which applicants it

13

would hire as firefighters.

14

the cutoff score had an adverse impact on qualified

15

black applicants and was not job-related.

16

There’s no dispute that

The only question presented is whether each

17

use of the cutoff score in each of the hiring rounds was

18

a separate violation of Title VII.

19

answer to that question is both the best reading of the

20

statute and the soundest policy.

21

An affirmative

Section 703(k) of Title VII provides that in

22

a disparate impact case, as this case, an unlawful

23

employment practice is established -- those are the

24

words -- "is established" when, quote, "a respondent

25

uses an employment practice that causes disparate impact

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

on the basis of race," close quote.
Section 703(h) states that, quote, "a test,

3

its application, and action upon the results," close

4

quote, are each violations of Title VII if they are,

5

quote, "used to discriminate," close quote.

6
7
8

Section 703(a)(2) prohibits racially
discriminatory classifications.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So under your

9

position, say the City adopts a discriminatory -- takes

10

a -- issues a discriminatory test; people take it; they

11

come out with the results; the City says these -- this

12

is the test we’re going to use, but, you know, we don't

13

have any vacancies.

14

Nobody can sue at that point.

MR. PAYTON:

No, no.

Our position is that

15

in fact there was an additional violation when the

16

classification occurred when the City announced what it

17

intended to do in the future.

That’s also a violation.

18

But if I can make the contrast,

19

Mr. Chief Justice, when the City -- suppose they didn't

20

announce anything at all, and what they did was in all

21

those occasions, the 11 I just described -- they used the

22

unlawful cutoff score and made hiring decisions.

23

Title VII's disparate impact looks at the

24

consequences of decisions like that.

25

consequences, the results of that clearly occur in the

4
Alderson Reporting Company

And those

Official

1

future on those 11 hiring occasions, and then we would

2

clearly have a cause of action on each of those 11 times.
Now, I'll come back and say that Chicago

3
4

announces, before it does any of that, that it intends to

5

do that in the future.

6

independent violation, but that announcement does not

7

change the impact and the consequences that in fact

8

still would happen in the future when they happen.

9

That announcement is an

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There’s an independent

10

violation without an impact?

I mean, it's not the

11

impact provision that you quoted which makes that a

12

violation.

13

it a violation.

It must be some other provision that makes
What other provision is it?

14

MR. PAYTON:

Well, there is an impact.

15

mean when the announcement is made?

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MR. PAYTON:

Right.

When the announcement is

18

made -- let me make two points:

19

we -- you could clearly seek to enjoin Chicago from

20

doing something unlawful in the future --

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MR. PAYTON:

23
24
25

You

First of all, I believe

Sure.

-- as you clearly have a cause

of action at the announcement.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

We know that.

Well, that’s because of

an impending violation.

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. PAYTON:

2

JUTICE SCALIA:

3

Because an impending violation -But you say -- you say it is

an actual violation.

4

MR. PAYTON:

Yes.

And the question whether

5

or not the announcement itself is in violation of the

6

statute, I believe section 703(a)(2) and, actually, all

7

three provisions, make it unlawful to actually have a

8

classification that has the effects I just said, and

9

the effects would simply be in how they were sorting

10

the results.
So I think there is an impact.

11

It's not the

12

same impact that ripples through time.

13

said, if they had not made an announcement it’s clear

14

there are consequences that happen in the future each of

15

those 11 times, there’s an additional violation when

16

they actually use the announcement to say what they

17

intend to do.

18

they do it.

19

And the reason I

They say what they intend to do, and then
Those are two different violations.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, the language of

20

the statute of 703 is to "limit, segregate, or

21

classify."

22

MR. PAYTON:

Yes.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So is it your position

24

that the violation occurs at the classification that’s

25

announced and that every subsequent hiring has limited

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

someone's opportunity so that they -- there’s a

2

violation subsequently under the limit clause as opposed

3

to the classification clause, or it's each event is a

4

classification violation?

5

MR. PAYTON:

It's our position that, in

6

fact, all three of the sections I quoted from are

7

implicated in the actions that Chicago took.

8

Clearly, there’s a classification, but when

9

they actually exclude from actual consideration for any

10

of the jobs on the 11 occasions, that's a limitation.

11

It's clearly a limitation.

12

results, that's an action upon the test results.

13

they use that to make decisions, that's clearly a

14

violation of (k).

15

When they use the test
When

All three provisions are in fact implicated,

16

sometimes in similar ways, sometimes in different ways.

17

All of them have consequences.

18

And the way disparate impact law works is,

19

you have an employment practice -- it's always facially

20

neutral -- that has an adverse impact on the basis of

21

race that causes there to be a disparate impact and

22

consequences.

23

of the disparate impact violation are not complete until

24

we have all of those elements.

25

We look at consequences, and the elements

JUSTICE ALITO:

Your position may -- may follow

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

from the language of Title VII, but you began by saying

2

that it also represents the best policy.

3

if you could explain why that is so.

4

And I wonder

Here, the City of Chicago continued to use

5

this test for quite a number of years after it was

6

administered.

7

gather that someone could still file a disparate impact

8

claim 6 or 7 years after the test was first administered,

9

and quite a few years after it was first used in making

And so as you interpret the statute, I

10

a hiring decision.

11

Congress's evident desire in Title VII to require that an

12

EEOC charge be filed rather promptly after the employment

13

action is taken?

14

And how can that be squared with

MR. PAYTON:

I think the answer is that this

15

is completely consistent with how the statute works, but

16

I'm going to address the policy concern as well.

17

how the statute works is, there’s a violation every

18

time there’s a use.

19

If we looked at disparate treatment, there’s

20

a violation every time there’s an intention to

21

discriminate.

22

discriminate, there would be a new violation.

23

there is a next use, there’s a next violation.

24

that's how that ought to work.

25

But

If there was a future intention to

Chicago should have stopped using the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If it -- if it stopped using

7

it, it might be vulnerable to a Rizzo-type suit from the

8

people who were benefiting.

9

MR. PAYTON:

I actually think that that

10

conflict is not present.

11

decision that responds to something that was unlawful.

12

And I think this Court has always made it clear the

13

standard may be in Ricci, but the law is clearly that if

14

Chicago has reason to believe -- very good reason to

15

believe that it is doing something that is unlawful, it

16

can stop doing something unlawful.

the case here.

18

Chicago can always make a

That’s especially

I thought in Ricci that

19

was New Haven's position, that they thought that the

20

test was unlawful because of the disparate impact.

21

MR. PAYTON:

I understand.

The standard

22

that may apply to Chicago's decision may be different,

23

but let me give you the example in this case.

24
25

Chicago used a cutoff score that the
district court finds and that their expert who designed

the test told them was problematic, to make decisions

2

that has nothing job-related about it at all.

vice versa.

6

picking randomly from that group, both groups combined,

7

and making the decisions on a random draw.

fact, how they made all of the decisions inside of the

9

groups that they used.

10

It's

The group that are qualified are as

They had available to them the option of

That is, in

That’s always available.

Chicago could have done that at any time.
The policy point here, Justice Alito, is

11
12

that -- I'd say the animating purpose behind Title VII is,

13

as this Court has said, the eradication of

14

discrimination from our workplace.

15

be eradicated.

16

this.

17

say, that when they use something that is unlawful, they

18

can be challenged every time they use something that is

19

unlawful.

Chicago should not have continued doing

that last hired is laid off, on the ground that if

2

Chicago had done what it was supposed to do, this person

3

would have had the job long ago and would be higher up

4

on the seniority list?

5
6

MR. PAYTON:

Let me give you two responses

to that.

7

The first answer is that the statute of

8

limitations is 300 days after every use, and it's no

9

longer.

So for whatever it is, if you violate

10

Title VII, the statute of limitations is 300 days.

11

there is a use that goes into the future, it's 300 days

12

after the last use.

13

using that.

14

challenge this.

15

If

Right now, Chicago has stopped

The doors are closed.

No one else can

To your specific question about how would it

16

work if there was a layoff arrangement, the proposed --

17

the remedy order in this case -- it's not in effect

18

because we are where we are -- but the remedy order in

19

this case includes shutting down the use of this, but it

20

also has provisions for seniority to in fact address, I

21

believe, exactly the circumstances you just described,

22

Justice Ginsburg.

23

handled in the remedial order.

24
25

So I believe that is contemplated and

The issue about the policy here, though, is
that if you don't say that a use, in fact, can be

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

challenged, a use of something unlawful can be

2

challenged, what you could end up with here is that

3

Chicago would then take the message that it's okay once

4

they are past the first 300 days, and they could just go

5

on using the discriminatory cutoff score over and over

6

and over again, and that is inconsistent with the

7

overall policy of what Title VII is trying to root out

8

of our economy and in our workplace.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Payton, can I ask this

10

general question?

11

the qualified group who did not make the well-qualified

12

has a cause of action as though he had been refused

13

employment when anyone else is hired?

14

people hired, as I understand.

15

hirings give everybody else in the class a cause of

16

action?

17

Am I correct that each firefighter in

MR. PAYTON:

There were 11

Did each one of those

The group of the black

18

qualified applicants that are in the qualified category,

19

but the qualified category is qualified as the other

20

category -- every time the city made decisions about

21

filling jobs in the fire department, it excluded every

22

single one of those applicants, even though they were

23

qualified.

24
25

So every single one was excluded.
So they all have a cause of action because

they were excluded and that clearly fits very easily

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

within how --

2
3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But surely they couldn't

all recover, because there was only one job available.

4

MR. PAYTON:

No.

That's correct.

That's about

5

what the remedy would be.

So the remedy and -- you know,

6

obviously wouldn't be to give all of them jobs.

7

not the remedy, and that wasn’t the remedy that's

8

sought -- was sought here.

9

from consideration, and that's a violation of Title VII's

That's

But they were all excluded

10

disparate impact prohibition.

11

of action.

So they all have a cause

12

The way the remedy would work --

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

What is -- what is the

14

remedy other than saying change your practice?

15

-- say one person sues and asks for damages, what

16

would the remedy be for a single applicant who was not

17

hired at the time somebody else was hired?
MR. PAYTON:

18

It may be very little.

What is

So if

19

it's a single applicant who sues and not a class -- this

20

is a class.

21

would be to stop using the unlawful cutoff score, okay,

22

and then to figure out what would have happened if that

23

unlawful cutoff score hadn't have occurred, and that

24

would have created a very miniscule chance of ever

25

becoming a firefighter and perhaps turning that into

So if a single applicant sues, the remedy

13
Alderson Reporting Company

some sort of damage award, but it would be miniscule.

2

In the actual event, the award includes some

actual jobs being allocated to the 6,000 members of the

class -- it was 132 -- to be decided upon in some random

5

way that they would be hired.

7

all excluded from consideration in all 11 rounds, in

8

violation of Title VII.

But that's how it would

But they are all clearly injured when they are

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that -- each --

10

each qualified firefighter who did not get a job because

11

the well-qualified one did has a new cause of action, I

12

guess, every time somebody is hired from the -- the

13

well-qualified pool?

14

MR. PAYTON:

Every time --

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In other words,

16

somebody is hired, that constitutes discrimination

17

against the qualified black firefighter who was not

18

hired, and then another -- then somebody else is

19

hired -- each time it's a new cause of action?

20

MR. PAYTON:

They had 11 rounds of hiring --

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

MR. PAYTON:

Yes.

-- that are relevant to this case.

23

There are other rounds afterwards.

They exhaust the first

24

category.

25

of those rounds the unlawful cutoff score is used, that is

But in the 11 rounds of hiring, when in every one

that is the use of something that causes an adverse impact

3

on the basis of race -- and, yes --

4
5

That is a limitation.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You know,

Yes, so they would

have a new cause of action, sure.

6

MR. PAYTON:

That’s a cause of action.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Now, but they -- but

8

if 300 days go from the first round of hiring, they

9

don't -- they cannot sort of piggyback that onto a later

10

cause of action.
MR. PAYTON:

11

Yes, if they sue -- in this

12

case, the EEOC charge was filed after the second round

13

of hiring, and in this case then, therefore, no remedy

14

can take account of the first round of hiring.

15

had sued only on the seventh round of hiring, no remedy

16

could take account of those forgone opportunities.

that would also play out in how the remedial order would

work.

MR. KATYAL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
As the questions I think reveal, I think the

3
4

bottom line question in this case is whether or not

5

under the text of Title VII there was a present

6

violation in each of the 11 rounds of hiring when the

7

City of Chicago relied on its concededly discriminatory

8

test to exclude the plaintiffs from consideration.

9

we think that Title VII has three mutually reinforcing

10

provisions in it, each of which point to the same

11

conclusion.

And

A violation of Title VII occurred in this

12
13

case when Chicago, in each of those 11 rounds, used its

14

hiring practice with -- and caused a disparate impact,

15

thereby limiting the employment opportunities of certain

16

applicants.

17

that ability test in a way that Title VII forbids.

18

took action upon the results of that discriminatory test

19

in a way that arbitrarily excluded qualified applicants

20

from being hired.

21

Chicago gave an ability test and relied on
It

Justice Alito, I think -- in response to your

question, I think our position follows entirely from the

text of the statute.

Court were concerned about the policy consequences, we

We’re not as concerned about the

2

distinguished between disparate treatment and disparate

3

impact litigation.

4

itself, and in particular 703(h), which forbids action

5

upon the results.

6

But it's the language of Title VII

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why would Congress have

7

wanted to allow a question like this to be left open for

8

such an extended period of time?

9

wanted everybody who is potentially affected by it to

Why would it not have

10

understand where things stand at a much earlier point,

11

at some reasonable period of time after all of the

12

information is in the -- in the possession of a

13

potential plaintiff to determine whether there has been

14

a disparate impact and whether that -- that person is

15

going to be adversely affected by it, particularly if at

16

a later point the effect of a remedial decree can be to

17

upset the employment -- the employment status of other

18

people who have been hired in the interim?

19

MR. KATYAL:

I agree that there -- there

20

might be policy arguments against it as well as for it,

21

but here's the way I think we look at it -- and the

22

United States is the nation's largest employer, and we

23

face similar concerns.

24
25

We give certain tests.

But I think what might have been -- what was
probably animating Congress was a fear that if the

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

rule of the City of Chicago were adopted, then an

2

employer who made it 300 days without an EEOC charge

3

being filed, 300 days after the announcement of the test

4

results, would then be able to for all time use that

5

discriminatory test, and it would lock in that period,

6

that test, for as long as 10, 20 years, and Congress

7

could have legitimately worried about if a test made it

8

300 days, an employer essentially had a get-out-of-jail-

9

free card to use for all time.

And I would say that

10

that precise thing appears to have happened in this very

11

case.

12

At Joint Appendix page 54, when the City

13

announced its test results in January of 1996,

14

it said it intended to use this test for only 3

15

years through 1999.

16

the City's own briefs -- this is the court of appeals

17

brief at page 12 -- they admit they made a new decision

18

to continue using this test and the test results for

19

subsequent hiring rounds.

20

indeed that's a decision, I think, many employers would

21

logically make after 3 years, because then they

22

don't have to worry about the possibility of a disparate

23

impact lawsuit.

24
25

Afterwards, 1999 came, the City, in

That was a new decision, and

And since, as this Court said in Ricci, one
of the goals of Title VII is really to encourage

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

voluntary compliance on the part of employers, adopting

2

a rule like the City of Chicago's is really antithetical

3

to that, because then it will essentially lock in for

4

all time that old discriminatory test.

5

I think another reason policy -- another

6

policy reason Congress may have thought about is that a

7

rule that forced people to file within 300 days might be

8

damaging to the EEOC and divisive to employers, because

9

it would say you only have that 300-day period to file,

10

even before all the consequences of the -- of the -- of

11

the employment decision are fully understood.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, actually in -- in

this case, am I correct that -- that 9 years has gone by,

but that's because of the litigation?

15

what, 4 months after the 300-day period ran?

16

MR. KATYAL:

The suit was filed,

The first charge was filed, I

17

believe, 420 days after the January 26th announcement of

18

the test results.

19

was a period of discovery and litigation over business

20

necessity and the like.

21

And, yes, Justice Kennedy, then there

And in this case, the City admitted in other

22

litigation that there was no basis for giving this 89

23

cutoff score, that a person who scored 65 was just as

24

likely to succeed as a firefighter as a person who

25

was -- who had scored 89.

1

Justice Stevens, you had asked about the

2

remedy in the case, and here's how we understand the way

3

remedies work in disparate impact litigation:

4

largely injunctive in nature.

5

preventing future problems.

6

It's

It's mostly about

There is a back pay claim that is available

7

that is statutorily capped at 2 years.

Not everyone in

8

this 6,000-person class could get that full amount of

9

back pay obviously.

Instead, what happened here, there

10

was a remedial phase at trial, and what they did was they

11

decided that -- the experts on both sides admitted that

12

132 people, approximately, would have been hired out of

13

that class, and that provided the appropriate amount of

14

back pay.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17
18

So you get --

Was it -- was it 132 named

people or was it just 132 undifferentiated?
MR. KATYAL:

I think it was 132

19

undifferentiated people, and then I think there --

20

and Mr. Payton can, I think, fully explain how the

21

randomization of awards was allocated.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So everybody gets

23

132 over 6,000 times whatever the number of people who

24

would have been hired?

25

MR. KATYAL:

Right.

And --

20
Alderson Reporting Company

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I mean the pay for

the number of people.
MR. KATYAL:

3

Right.

And, Mr. Chief Justice,

4

to respond to your concern before, that amount of money

5

is not -- you couldn't go back and look to earlier

6

periods of time outside of the statute of limitations,

7

outside of the 300-day period, rather only any

8

subsequent use.

9

couldn't look to the first round of hiring because no

For example, in this case the remedy

10

lawsuit was brought within that first round of hiring.

11

It was brought at the -- it was brought after the second

12

round of hiring.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think you had a

14

footnote in your reply brief that said that if your

15

position prevails there would need to be an adjustment

16

in the relief granted by the district court --

17

MR. KATYAL:

That is --

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

MR. KAYTAL:

-- wasn’t it?

That is correct.

And I think

20

that the Petitioners agree with that as well.

And

21

that's I think a further limit on the way in which this

22

present violation theory operates as a matter of

23

practice.

24

Ledbetter that -- that there must be a present

25

violation, and disparate impact litigation looks quite

Now, this Court has said in cases such as

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

different than disparate treatment litigation in

2

practice, because disparate impact litigation doesn't

3

need that missing element that has been at issue in

4

Ledbetter and Evans and Ricks, of discriminatory intent

5

at that subsequent time of action.

6

Here, in a disparate impact case, all that

7

need be shown by the plaintiff is adverse impact, and

8

that adverse impact happens in each of those 11 rounds

9

of hiring.

Each of the time -- each time the City used

10

its test results and drew a line and said, you under 89,

11

we are not looking at you, that was action upon the

12

results, to use the language of (h)(2).

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that would be clear

14

even though it had not been established much earlier

15

that the test was invalid.

16

using a test that was an invalid test, not declared

17

such; 10 years later, somebody comes up and says:

18

test that is being applied to me is an invalid test.

19
20

MR. KATYAL:

So a city could go along

This

That's exactly correct, Justice

Scalia.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What -- of what use is a

22

statute of limitations that -- that -- that operates

23

that way?

24
25

MR. KATYAL:

Let me say two things:

First

is I think (h)(2) refers to "action upon the results,"

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and that thing happened in 10 years is itself action

2

upon the results, and so I think as a statutory matter

3

the language decides it.

4

Now, with respect to the policy reason, I

5

think the reason is that otherwise Congress had to fear

6

precisely what you’re saying, that an employer 10

7

years from now would use that discriminatory test,

8

because they knew they had made it past the 300-day

9

initial phase of time, and then could use it for all

10

time.

11

concerns about repose work hand in hand with other

12

concerns of Title VII, and in particular incentivizing

13

employers to ensure voluntary compliance with the law of

14

Title VII, and which this Court said in Griggs, the goal

15

of which is to eradicate discrimination from the United

16

States' labor markets.

17

And so the statute of limitations and the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So I suppose the

18

benefit is not that the City knows it's safe -- it can

19

rely on a test and all that -- but knows that it only has

20

to pay 300 days back.

21

MR. KATYAL:

That is -- that is -- that is

22

the benefit of that particular back pay limitation, yes.

23

But in a case like this, where the City knows very well,

24

this test is discriminatory and, indeed, has said so in

25

litigation, I think Congress wanted to incentivize and

23

1

make sure there was an ability for people to sue at each

2

time that discriminatory test was used.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENNA RUTH SOLOMON

7

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

8
9

MS. SOLOMON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

In January 1996, the City adopted and

11

announced an eligibility list for hiring candidates who

12

sat for the firefighters' examination.

13

told that a priority pool had been created, that based

14

on their scores they were not classified in that pool,

15

and that further consideration of candidates would be

16

limited to those who were in the priority pool, at least

17

until everyone in that pool had been called for

18

processing.

19

Petitioners were

The City also publicly admitted that this

20

tiered eligibility list had adverse impact on

21

African-Americans, and Petitioners were aware of this.

22

But Petitioners did not file charges challenging the

23

exam and the cutoff score within 300 days after the

24

tiered eligibility list was adopted and announced.

25

Now they contend that charges can be filed

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to challenge the same exam and the same cutoff score

2

every time the City hired from the priority hiring pool.

3

That position cannot be squared with the statute.

4

Calling other applicants from a hiring pool from which

5

Petitioners had already been excluded did not limit or

6

classify Petitioners in any way.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Suppose there were no

8

list, but each time there was a hiring round the City

9

just took from the top -- from the top score down.

10

There’s no list, but each time the City uses the test

11

results and hires the people with the top scores.

12

MS. SOLOMON:

If I understand correctly,

13

that would be the same case as this, for this reason:

14

A list is used in a couple of different ways.

15

might be used to describe the strict rank ordering that

16

Your Honor is describing, and in that case, once there

17

is that kind of a list, it's the same as this case.

18

A list

What happened in this case after that kind

19

of a list was made, we also drew another line, which was

20

the priority hiring pool.

21
22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
was there’s no list at all.

23

MS. SOLOMON:

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

No, my -- my hypothetical

If -They just go back to the

raw scores, and each time they picked the top people.

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MS. SOLOMON:

So that actually -- if we’re

2

going back to the scores but no announcement has been

3

made ever that we are going to use the scores in a

4

certain way, we agree that every time the city actually

5

consulted the scores, there would be a new claim.

6

that's because --

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But

Well, what is -- what is

8

the list, other than an administratively convenient way

9

to use the scores?

10

MS. SOLOMON:

The list was the device that

11

limited and classified Petitioners in this case, and

12

that's why it's so important.

13

a present cause of action, section (a)(2) -- under

14

section (a)(2), which is the disparate impact provision,

15

Petitioners have to point to something in the charging

16

period that actually limited and classified them.

17

that was the effect of the list, and including the

18

priority hiring pool.

19

Because in order to have

And

In a case where there is no general

20

practice, no announcement, no decision, nothing, but

21

rather every time the City makes hiring, the City

22

undertakes a new decision with new criteria, then it is

23

making a decision at that point; it is engaging in a

24

practice that is then at that time limiting and

25

classifying the Petitioners.

What happened --

compilation of the list and the notice of the list; you sue

13

your position, is it not?

14

The discriminatory practice gets frozen,

MS. SOLOMON:

That's -- that is

That is the function of the

15

operation of the statute of limitations, and of course

16

it's not unique to Title VII.

But this is not exactly a

18

title -- a statute of limitations.

It's a charge filing.

There’s also a 2-year

and when a timely charge is not filed, no recovery can

2

be had for that claim.

3

and over in a series of disparate treatment cases.

And the Court has said that over

4

Now, the defining feature --

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You -- you don't have one

6

case, I think, certainly not from this Court, of

7

disparate impact.

8

disparate treatment cases.

9

All the cases that you cite are

MS. SOLOMON:

The cases are disparate

10

treatment cases, Justice Ginsburg, but the rule should

11

be the same in this case for several reasons: First,

12

those cases reflect that the reason there is not

13

a present violation when the consequences of a prior

14

discriminatory act are felt is because the defining

15

feature of the claim is absent within the charging

16

period.

17

Now, that is a perfectly good rule, no matter

18

whether it's discriminatory treatment or discriminatory

19

impact.

20

disparate impact in the sense defined by the statute,

21

required by the statute, to limit or classify in a way

22

that denies people employment opportunities based on

23

race -- that defining feature was absent within the

24

charging period.

25

And in this case, the defining feature, namely

JUSTICE BREYER:

How is it absent?

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Because

Official

1

the statute says that the established -- the -- it's

2

established -- namely, the unlawful employment practice

3

-- it's established only if, and certainly if, the

4

respondent uses --

5

MS. SOLOMON:

Right.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- a particular employment

7

practice that has a disparate impact.

8

to (a)(2).

9

That refers back

So back in that period, on a certain date, he

10

used that limiting practice, and, therefore, on that

11

particular date, he established the unlawful employment

12

practice by using a test that limited, et cetera.

13

MS. SOLOMON:

I -- I have two responses,

14

Justice Breyer, and the first is that section (k), which

15

is what Your Honor is quoting from, does not describe

16

accrual, and it does not define the underlying violation.

17

It talks about when an -- excuse me, when a violation is

18

established.

19

reliance on those words "uses an employment practice" --

20

it’s a few words plucked out of the middle of section (k).

21

And what's so interesting is that the

You actually can't apply section (k)

22

literally to this case and have anything that approaches

23

anything that makes sense.

24

(k) actually goes on after those words that get

25

highlighted over and over, and it’s -- and it refers to

And that's because section

disparate impact is tried.

And so if you --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

subsection (h) --

an -- "it shall be an unlawful employment practice for

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Justice Breyer's point.

hiring, you are using the test results and saying --

23

each time you do it, you’re saying:

24

off at this limit, and I'm not going to consider someone

25

outside of this limited tier.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MS. SOLOMON:

Well, that's what is actually

2

missing in this case.

The city did not go back to the

3

test results, and it did not -- it did not create --

4

engage in a new decision or a new practice.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But isn't that what

6

"practice and policy" means?

7

you continue forward, you are using a particular

8

practice, a particular policy?

9

MS. SOLOMON:

Meaning that each time, as

Petitioners continued to be

10

ineligible for as long as the list was used in the way

11

that we said at the outset it was going to be used;

12

namely, that the well-qualified pool, the priority

13

hiring pool, would be called first.
The reason they continued to be ineligible

14
15

is because they had been limited and classified as

16

ineligible until the priority pool was hired first.

17

That was the only practice that had adverse impact

18

within -- as required by the statute, meaning limit and

19

classify.
Now, to complete my answer to

21

Justice Breyer -JUSTICE STEVENS:

suggesting the 65 cutoff score was because of the

to measure the cognitive aspects that it was attempting

to measure, and that those related to the training

assessing the options, the City was not sued within --

7

the tiered eligibility list was adopted and announced.

Petitioners were aware that it had adverse impact.

That

How do you -- the problem I

10

have with all of this -- it makes entire sense, except

11

when you read subpart (k), it says “an unlawful

12

employment practice based on disparate impact is

13

established” if “a complaining party demonstrates that a

14

respondent uses a particular employment practice that

15

causes a disparate impact on the basis of race.”

16

MS. SOLOMON:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

Correct.

But you have --

Which is what happened

here.

MS. SOLOMON:

But the fact --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MS. SOLOMON:

They used --

Excuse me, Justice Scalia.

22

The statute goes on, and it describes the later things

23

that happened at trial.

24

literally --

25

So in our view, read

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Where -- where does it go

44
Alderson Reporting Company

1

on?

To say what?

2

MS. SOLOMON:

It goes on to say that the

3

respondent fails to demonstrate that the challenged

4

process is job-related, or subpart (ii), there is

5

an alternative practice with less disparate impact.

6

-- so (k), if (k) is going to be consulted at all, and

7

we do not think that it should be, because section

8

706(e), which has always been thought of as the charging

9

period, talks about an alleged unlawful practice, and

10

So

that's what the person knows at the outset.

11

Section (k) talks about the burden of proof

12

and how you go about proving these at trial, and that's

13

why it uses the word "established."

14

it describes the entirety of what happens at trial.

Read literally, you can pluck a few words out of the --

16

out of one of these provisions and say, aha, they used

17

an employment practice.

18

thing together if you’re going to read it at all, and

19

when you read the whole thing together, you come up with

20

the absurd result that the charging period doesn't run

21

until the district court brings the gavel down and

22

determines that an unlawful practice has been

23

established.

24

those things is that it was used.

One of

things there will not have been -- are things that --

like six or seven that have to do with the test and the

criteria, and then you have one that it was used.
