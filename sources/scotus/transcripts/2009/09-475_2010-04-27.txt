CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We’ll hear

argument this morning in Case 09-475, Monsanto

Company v. Geertson Seed Farms, et al.

6

Mr. Garre.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. GARRE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

Biotech crops have produced enormous

12

benefits for the nation's farmers and consumers.

13

district court in this case issued a broad-based

14

injunction against the planting of a highly beneficial,

15

genetically engineered alfalfa crop.

16

sustaining that injunction, the courts below erred in

17

two fundamental respects.

18

The

In entering and

First, they short-circuited the requisite

19

inquiry into the likelihood of reparable -- irreparable

20

harm, because they reasoned that the agency was going to

21

get into this anyway in the course of preparing its

22

environmental impact statement.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

And --

Mr. Garre, the Respondents

24

argue that we should dismiss the writ here as

25

improvidently granted, and I wonder if you could explain

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

why that isn't the preferred course of conduct.

2

contend that when this was before the Ninth Circuit,

3

your firm could have but did not contest the -- the

4

vacatur of the APHIS deregulation order.

5

that an environmental impact statement is likely to be

6

issued very soon, or fairly soon.

7

General could give us an estimate.

8
9

They

It’s argued

Maybe the Solicitor

If we agree with your argument that the
Ninth Circuit applied the wrong preliminary injunction

10

standard and remand for them to apply the right

11

preliminary injunction standard, the case may be moot by

12

the time they do that.

13

plow into the extremely fact-bound question whether

14

applying what you contend to be the correct preliminary

15

injunction standard of relief would be warranted on this

16

record.

17
18

And the alternative is for us to

In light of all that, why shouldn't we take
their suggestion?

19

MR. GARRE:

The Court shouldn't, Justice

20

Alito.

21

judgment that contains the vacatur and the injunction.

22

And our notice of appeal, which is on page 59 and 61 of

23

the excerpts of record in the Ninth Circuit, makes clear

24

that we explicitly appealed the vacatur as well.

25

First as to the vacatur, we appealed the

And let me explain that a little bit more,

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

but first I want to say as to the environmental impact

2

statement, the government can address that more, but my

3

understanding is that we’re probably about a year away

4

from the environmental impact statement.

5

presents important legal issues concerning the entry of

6

injunctive relief.

7

This case

We think the Court properly granted

8

certiorari and should decide those issues.

We think

9

that, although the record is large, that this Court can

10

decide, as it did in Winter, that as a matter of law

11

this record does not support a finding of irreparable

12

harm.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But Winter didn't involve

14

something -- as I understand, the -- the decision

15

vacated the deregulation order.

16

that.

17

decision in place, then we’re back to the Plant

18

Protection Act, and there’s no authorization for the

19

planting of these crops.

20

challenged the vacation of the deregulation decision, I

21

don't see how there's anything for us to deal with.

22

You are not challenging

Well, it seems to me if there’s no deregulation

MR. GARRE:

So as long as you haven't

We did appeal the vacatur as

23

well as the injunction which is contained as part of the

24

same judgment.

25

We know that the district --

However, you haven't in

3

it originally, but the point is that you didn't seek

4

certiorari on that ground.

5

Didn't you say you weren't challenging the
You keep saying -- I know you appealed

MR. GARRE:

Well, we -- our argument all

6

along, Justice Sotomayor has been that the court, the

7

district court, erred in not adopting the government's

8

proposed judgment.

9

petition appendix, that proposed judgment makes clear

If you look on page 184 of the

10

that it’s intended to replace the district court's

11

judgment, including the vacatur.

12

argument about --

13

So all along the whole

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You agree that those

14

are two different things, then, right?

15

one thing and the injunction is another, right?

16

MR. GARRE:

The vacatur is

They are part and parcel of the

17

same judgment.

It's true, a vacatur is different than

18

an injunction.

But here --

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And under the

20

vacatur, the normal APA remedy is a remand to the agency.

21

In fact, there are some courts that say you can't get

22

anything else.

23

that the burden is on you to get something short of

24

complete remand.

25

get -- establish the injunction.

But whether you can or can't, it's clear

The burden is on your friends to

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

The problem with combining the two, it seems

1
2

to me, is that you are imposing on them the burden to

3

meet the injunction standard simply to get a remand to

4

which they are entitled under the APA.
MR. GARRE:

5

Well, the district court could

6

have vacated the order in its entirety and send it back

7

to the agency.

8

ahead and enjoined the planting of RRA, Roundup Ready

9

alfalfa, but --

It didn't do that.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10
11

that.

12

vacated.

It not only went

But the vacatur does

You can't plant once the deregulation order is

MR. GARRE:

13

The vacatur was in part.

We

14

know that because the district court's judgment allowed

15

the continued planting and harvesting of Roundup Ready

16

alfalfa, the planting before 2007.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But -So you would say

18

that the injunction is limited only to a decision the

19

agency might make to allow partial planting?
MR. GARRE:

20

Well -- and importantly, the district

21

court's judgment -- and it's on page 108 of the petition

22

appendix --

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

MR. GARRE:

25

Right.

-- not only enjoined the planting

of Roundup Ready alfalfa, it enjoined the agency from taking

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

interim measures.

It --

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

MR. GARRE:

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

We -Right.

Why

5

did it do that?

6

sent back to the agency.

7

partially deregulate, it can do it.

8

challenge it under the normal APA procedures.

9

I mean, the way the APA works, this is

MR. GARRE:

10

If the agency wants to
And then you can

And that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's very odd to get

11

an injunction to an agency telling them they can't do

12

something under the APA.

13

MR. GARRE:

Well, I'm not going to disagree

14

with you on that.

It is important that they enjoined

15

the agency from implementing the very proposed measures

16

that we’re now finding -- fighting --

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

MR. GARRE:

19

I’m looking at --

-- in the context of an

injunction.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

I'm looking at page 58a.

21

Maybe that -- you referred to what as the district

22

court's -MR. GARRE:

23
24
25

108a.

It's 108a of the petition

appendix.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Because I thought that

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the only purpose of this injunctive provision was to

2

spare the people who had already purchased seeds,

3

allowing those to be planted until March 30, 2007.

4

MR. GARRE:

Planting was allowed until

5

March 30, 2007, and then that alfalfa could be continued

6

to be harvested; seeds would be harvested and maintained

7

separately.

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And is it your position that

9

that gives you the hook, the entry point, for saying,

10

well, now the district judge didn't just replicate in

11

all respects the universe without the regulation; it had

12

some specific injunctive relief, and it didn't go far

13

enough?

That’s -MR. GARRE:

14

Absolutely.

That in combination

15

with the fact that it actually enjoined the agency from

16

what it could have done, otherwise done, under --

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But whose --

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What authority do

19

you have for the proposition that when a court vacates

20

an administrative order, it has the authority to tailor

21

an injunction rather than simply remand the matter to

22

the agency?

23

MR. GARRE:

Well, I think this Court's

24

decision in Weinberger involved at least an analogous

25

situation, where the court found a statutory violation

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of the Clean Water Act.

2

of a decision, but the court then went on to add an

3

injunction on top of that.

4

violation that arguably prohibited the conduct.

5

It doesn't involve the vacatur

So you had the statutory

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I guess --

6

Weinberger, of course, involved a statute.

I mean, the

7

concern is that the authority to determine how far to go

8

in deregulating or partial deregulating is for the

9

agency to make.

And once there has been a violation of

10

the APA, it goes back to the agency.

11

court did here was assume that responsibility itself.
MR. GARRE:

12

What the district

And we at the outset at the

13

district court stage, if the -- if the district court had

14

done that, that would have been fine.

15

back.

16

measures that we’re now talking about in the context of

17

an injunction.

18

entered the injunction not only as to the sale of RRA,

19

but as to the agency taking --

It could have gone

The agency could have adopted the very proposed

The district court did not do that.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

MR. GARRE:

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It

Well, then --

-- those interim steps.
Mr. Garre, I'm looking at

23

the injunction, and it says that the deregulation decision

24

is vacated and Roundup Ready alfalfa is once again a

25

regulated article.

We could simply say as far as it goes,

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that's all right; anything else is surplusage.

2

to be the judgment that Roundup Ready alfalfa is once again

3

a regulated article, period.

4

MR. GARRE:

We take it

And we know the district court

5

didn't mean that literally, because its own judgment

6

allows the continued planting and harvesting of RRA

7

planted before --

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

MR. GARRE:

10

Well, but I thought --

-- March 2007.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that was just a

11

dispensation to people who had already bought the seeds.

12

That was recognizing that they had incurred an expense,

13

that they were all ready to plant.

14

only exception.

15

article with this one exception.

16

That -- that was the

It goes back to the status of a regulated

MR. GARRE:

Well, if it's a regulated

17

article, then there's no use of it allowed at all unless

18

the agency is granting exceptions.

19

court's grant of that exception was an exercise of

20

its equitable authority in the context of considering

21

Respondents' injunction.

22

So the district

Respondents have litigated this all along as

23

though the injunction provided something in addition to

24

the vacatur, and this Court's cases establish that the

25

injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy that

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

does.

It allows people to go into court to enforce it.

2

It provides an opportunity for contempt sanctions.
If I could just -- if I could address the

3
4

issue of irreparable harm, there are two key things the

5

Court -- we hope the Court will understand in

6

adjudicating the question of irreparable harm.

7

First is you need to separate out hay

8

production and seed production.

There’s absolutely no

9

evidence in this record whatsoever of any

10

cross-pollination from RRA hay fields to another hay

11

field.

12

broad-based to hay production and seed production.

13

at a minimum, we think you have to take seed production

14

out.

But

The next thing is that, when it comes to the

15
16

So the district court's injunction applies

risk of harm --

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

MR. GARRE:

Hay production out.

When alfalfa is grown for hay, for

19

forage, as opposed to grown for seeds which can then be

20

planted.

21

The next thing to know is what we're talking

22

about here is the risk that -- and Roundup Ready alfalfa

23

will appear in a conventional or organic alfalfa field.

24

We're not talking about transforming a single alfalfa

25

plant in the country.

It's the risk that an existing

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

alfalfa plant will produce a seed, which will then

2

produce another alfalfa plant which would be a Roundup

3

Ready alfalfa plant.

4

in this country is going to be harmed by the addition of

5

Roundup Ready alfalfa.

6

So not a single alfalfa plant

The district court found, on page 43 of the

7

petition appendix, that Roundup Ready alfalfa provides no

8

harm the --

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you tell me what's

10

the legal error?

11

one, which was short-circuiting the irreparable harm.

12

This seems more like factual correction which you're

13

getting into.

14

your legal claims?

15

You started by identifying the first

Put it into a legal box for me.

MR. GARRE:

Sure.

What are

There’s three legal

16

arguments we have, Justice Sotomayor.

17

district court short-circuited the whole analysis by

18

assuming up front that, since this was going to go to

19

environmental impact statement, it didn't have to

20

seriously get into the likelihood of irreparable harm.

21

And we think that that’s clear error under this Court's

22

Amoco decision.

23

The first is the

And, in fact, if you look at --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Would you explain,

24

Mr. Garre, why that's so, because I thought that the

25

Federal law is before the agency engages in an action

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that requires an EIS, it has to do the EIS?

2

unit of the Department of Agriculture violated Federal

3

law by deregulating prior to the completion of an EIS.

4

MR. GARRE:

So this

Federal law and the regulation

5

at 40 C.F.R. 1506.1(a) allows action to go forward where

6

there’s not an adverse environmental impact.

7

agency has explained in great detail in declarations

8

that allowing the very limited use of RRA under the

9

restricted conditions of the proposed injunctions would

10

not result in any environmental impact.
If I could reserve the remainder of my time

for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART,

17

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENTS,
SUPPORTING PETITIONERS

18
19
20
21

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I’d like first to address briefly

22

Justice Alito's question about the length of time that

23

the agency anticipates the EIS will take.

24

now anticipates that its best estimate is that the EIS

25

will be ready approximately a year from now.

14
Alderson Reporting Company

The agency

A draft

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

EIS has been submitted for public comment.

2

comment period was extended until early March of 2010.

3

The agency has received on the order of 145,000 public

4

comments.

5

The public

And, so, in addition to parsing through

6

those and seeing which of them need to be responded to,

7

the agency wants to consult with other Federal agencies.

8

And, so this process is going to take longer than APHIS

9

had anticipated at the outset.

10

Now, we said in our brief in opposition that

11

the fact that the EIS process was ongoing was a reason

12

for this Court to deny certiorari.

13

of how good an argument that was at the cert stage, the

14

Court has granted cert, and we think that the Court

15

should decide the case.

16

that the case will become moot before this Court's

17

decision is rendered.

18

I think regardless

There’s no realistic prospect

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you go to the

19

second part of Justice Alito's question, which was the

20

issue of standing, both yours and the Petitioners’.

21

What is it exactly that we’re being asked to review?

22

Obviously, you’re going ahead with the EIS.

23

haven't sought a stay of that.

24

MR. STEWART:

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You

That's correct.
All right.

15
Alderson Reporting Company

So what's the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

basis of the challenge to the injunction?

2

MR. STEWART:

When the district court issued

3

its summary judgment ruling, it asked the parties to

4

propose their own forms of a judgment.

5

have done what the Chief Justice suggested ought to have

6

been done; that is, it might have indicated that the

7

court -- that either it should simply issue a

8

declaratory judgment or that it should vacate the

9

deregulation order, and the matter would have been

10

And APHIS might

remanded to the agency to decide what to do next.

11

And if that had happened, the agency could

12

then have issued an administrative order that embodied

13

the same proposed conditions that were embodied in the

14

injunction.

15

challenged that, and we would have had a new lawsuit.

16

Presumably, the plaintiffs would have

Now, what APHIS tried to do, in essence, was

17

to streamline the process by combining into one steps

18

that could otherwise have been taken separately.

19

proposed an injunction that said the deregulation

20

decision is vacated and replaced by the following

21

protective conditions.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And it

You have the burden

23

to establish your entitlement to those conditions that

24

are short of a remand, correct?

25

MR. STEWART:

I don't think it would have

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

been our burden; that is, if the -- if the order had

2

simply been -- the deregulation order had simply been

3

vacated and remanded to the agency, and the agency had

4

then performed the analysis that’s reflected in the

5

Hoffman declarations and said we are putting in place a

6

complete deregulation --

7
8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Sure, sure.

Agencies can do that.

9

MR. STEWART:

Agencies can do that.

And it --

10

on review of that, it would not have been our burden to

11

establish that those -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

Well, sure, because

13

-- but here the question is whether the court can do

14

that.

15

agency.

16

authority that you can't do that at all, but certainly

17

you’d have the burden to establish that those

18

reliefs short of remand, that you are entitled to that.

19

The court is stepping into the shoes of the
And I would say it's -- I mean, there's

MR. STEWART:

I think in the ordinary

20

course, you’re absolutely correct.

21

case, it's an important principle to us that the court

22

should not usurp the agency's role.

23

And in the usual

Here I think, in fairness to the district

24

court, if the court had issued the injunction we

25

proposed with the protective measures that were

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reflected in the government's proposed judgment, the

2

court would not have been usurping the agency's role,

3

because it would have been adopting the very protective

4

measures that the agency identified as appropriate.

5

we think that the district --

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So

Well, you’re

7

short-circuiting notice and comment or whatever else is

8

required, the reason we send this to an agency, because

9

they are expert and all that.

The agency is acting

10

without the benefit of any input on the partial

11

deregulation.
MR. STEWART:

12

Well, it is certainly acting

13

with the benefit of whatever information it received in

14

the form of public comment in its original environmental

15

assessment for the complete deregulation.

16

addition, the district court, in deciding whether the

17

agency's proposed conditions would have been appropriate

18

could have entertained comments from obviously the

19

Respondents and from anyone else who wanted to

20

intervene.

And in

21

But to go back to Justice Sotomayor's --

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you have -- let's

23

just -- if this had -- if the order had vacated the

24

deregulation and sent it back to you, what would you

25

have -- the agency have had to do to issue temporary

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

regulations consistent with the ones you proposed to the

2

district court?

3

MR. STEWART:

Our view is that, first, that

4

we would not have had to go through public notice and

5

comment, because, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(2), there is an

6

exception for good cause, and here the relatively

7

limited timeframe that we were talking about in our view

8

would have constituted good cause.

9

plaintiffs might have challenged that.

10

Obviously, the

Now, we would have had to perform some sort

11

of environmental analysis to comply with our NEPA

12

obligations in order to feel sufficient confident --

13

confidence that implementation of our proposed measures

14

would not cause significant environmental impacts.

15

wouldn't have had to be an EIS; that is, NEPA provides,

16

in appropriate circumstances --

17

MR. STEWART:

It

I think that's -- it is

23

correct to say that, as a matter of the statute and the

a particular act, decision, and then implement that very

Yes, that's what I

thought.

MR. STEWART:

But our -- our core point here

is that what we were proposing for the interim, that is

allowing continued planting subject to various

7

protective measures, was fundamentally different from

8

the action on which the EIS was being prepared.

9

is --

That

But as far as the court

11

is concerned, it's conceded that NEPA was violated, an

EIS was required.

the deregulation decision.

14

at that point, the court is obliged to say, well, the

15

agency engaged in conduct that was not in accord with

16

law, and so we send it back.

And then the district court vacates

MR. STEWART:

You are correct.

And we are

not asserting the right to implement the deregulation

decision; that is, the decision removing all Federal

20

constraints from the planting and harvesting of RRA.

21

We’re not asserting the right to do that during the

22

pendency of the EIS process.

23

The CEQ regulations speak to this question,

24

and they don't say while an EIS is ongoing, no activity

25

related to the action for which the EIS is being

20

alternatives.

So, what the agency might have done at the

outset was say:

those, they would have had to meet --

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I guess my point is

8

they don't need an injunction.

The thing that’s

9

bothering me is you’ve got two different things, the

vacatur and the injunction.

11

them together, you’re trying to impose the burden on

12

the plaintiffs to meet the injunction standard to get

13

the benefit of the vacatur.
MR. STEWART:

And it seems to me by melding

Well, I think if this had

15

happened through the alternative events -- course of

16

events that I discussed previously; that is, if the

17

matter had been remanded back to the agency and the

18

agency had issued an administrative order that embodied

19

these proposed protective conditions, then the

20

plaintiffs would presumably have either filed a new

21

lawsuit or challenged this within the confines of this

22

suit.

23

that those protective measures were -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

The burden would have been on them to show both

that.

But you short-circuited

Isn't this more akin to you seeking a stay of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

vacating order?

2

MR. STEWART:

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I think -The district court

4

vacated the deregulation.

No one can plant.

You and

5

the Petitioners go into court and say to the court:

6

Stay that deregulation with respect to this kind of

7

planting.

8

so, isn't it your burden to show that you're entitled to

9

whatever it is you seek?

10

MR. STEWART:

Aren't you the one seeking the stay?

And if

Well, all that the court had

11

decided up to the point when we submitted our proposed

12

judgment was that an EIS was needed before the agency

13

could implement complete deregulation.

14

this respect the case is similar to Winter; that is, in

15

Winter in the district court -- the district court

16

initially imposed six restrictive measures on the Navy,

17

and the Navy elected not to challenge four of them but

18

challenged the other two.

19

have asked for, in a sense, vacatur of its proposed

20

action and then announced a new action that consisted of

21

compliance with the four unchallenged restrictive

22

measures and noncompliance with the other two.

23

And I think in

I suppose that the Navy could

From our perspective, rather than

24

short-circuiting the process, as I say, we were trying

25

to streamline it; that is, the court could have sent it

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

back to us, we could have told it what protective

2

measures were appropriate, and then some months later we

3

would have been back in court to review the adequacy of

4

those, particularly because we thought of the -- any

5

injunction as being something that would stay in effect

6

only for the relatively limited period of time while the

7

EIS was being prepared.

8
9

We tried to speed up the process by telling
the court in advance these are the protective measures

10

we think are appropriate without the need for a remand.

11

And the court's fundamental error was in equating what

12

we had proposed with the complete deregulation that was

13

the subject of the lawsuit.

14

agency's declarations explained why the protective

15

measures that were embodied in the government's proposed

16

injunction would have been fully sufficient to prevent

17

irreparable harm to the plaintiffs during the pendency

18

of the EIS.

I think that the -- the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So that's the legal

error you identify?

21

MR. STEWART:

That's the legal error we

22

identify.

We also think that the district court did,

23

without quite using these words, announce a presumption

24

in favor of injunctive relief; that is, the district

25

court said, wrongly in our view, that it couldn't assess

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

the adequacy of the proposed protective measures because

2

that would duplicate the analysis that was going on in

3

the EIS.

We think that was -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

would be okay?

this from going straight back to the agency?

And you would have no basis to prevent

13

that the district court did do in addition to that is to

the district court have entered the government's proposed

the -- the relevant risk that the district court had to

14

certainly one factor which powerfully distinguishes this

you’re not entitled to that, because the vacatur sends

17

it -- should send it back to the agency and they can

18

decide.

19

have the APA challenges available to you.

20

Well,

And if they decide to partially deregulate, you

MR. ROBBINS:

I -- I think,

21

Mr. Chief Justice, there is some considerable force to

22

the point that the injunction in that respect exceeded

23

the scope of the vacatur.

24

that they have standing only to challenge so much of the

25

injunction as exceeds the scope of the vacatur, but

And it may be -- it may be

that's not what they want.

What they want is to do all

2

the planting that the vacatur says they may not.

3

And so I --

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So your argument is

5

that the district court judge made a mistake in mixing

6

up the vacatur and the injunction?

7
8
9
10

MR. ROBBINS:

I would put it slightly

differently.
(Laughter.)
MR. ROBBINS:

I would say that the mistake

11

that was made was in not appreciating, though it was

12

called to his attention by the lawyers I -- by the party

13

I represent, that the vacatur did have this effect.

14

I do think that the injunction was sort of

15

allowed to be litigated.

16

they litigated the injunction.

17

a more demanding injunction --

18

There were many reasons why

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We, for example, wanted

But isn't one of the

19

reasons that they litigated the injunction was that by

20

its terms and because of its issuance the agency on

21

remand could not have adopted some partial measures to

22

allow controlled planting?

23

MR. ROBBINS:

Yes.

That is a reason why my

24

clients sought the injunction.

They sought -- they

25

sought other things in the injunction as well, but --

38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- no, but isn't

2

that -- isn't that the reason that the manufacturers,

3

Monsanto, contested the injunction?

4

because once the injunction is issued, as the

5

government has told us today, they cannot issue some

6

partial regulatory scheme with -- with safeguards.

7

MR. ROBBINS:

They said --

There is -- that’s doubtless

8

one reason why they litigated the injunction, but it is

9

not a reason, Justice Kennedy, that they have standing,

10

because vacating the current injunction will give them

11

nothing that they -- that they -- that isn't already

12

prohibited by the vacatur, except -- and I grant you

13

this -- it will allow them to go back to the agency,

14

seek a partial deregulation, which Mr. Stewart told -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

But that -- but that is

16

substantial.

17

injunction that's now in effect prohibits that.

18

they have standing to challenge that.

19

MR. ROBBINS:

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21
22

It takes time, and the district court
And

Well, I'm not -Or at least that's their

argument.
MR. ROBBINS:

That is their argument, but it

23

isn't right, and here's why:

One of the standing

24

requirements is imminence, that it must be an actual

25

harm or an imminent harm.

Now, here are the things that

39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would have to happen for that scenario to come to pass:

2

It would have to be remanded to the agency.

3

told us this morning there would have to be at least an

4

environmental -- an EA prepared, that may or may not

5

come out in favor of a partial deregulation.

6

would then be --

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Stewart

There

I don't mean to

8

interrupt your answer, but they’ve already done an EA

9

in support of total deregulation, presumably, and they

10

found no adverse -- presumably, that would be a fortiori

11

for partial.
MR. ROBBINS:

12

Well, we don't know.

I heard

13

Mr. Stewart, who speaks for the government, tell us that

14

it would require additional steps.

15

imminence cases, you know, can't -- do not accommodate

16

this many if's.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But this Court's

It seems to me pretty

doggone imminent if the agency has come before the court

2

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, I can -- I can tell you,

3

Your Honor, maybe the best authority I could give you on

4

how imminent this is, how -- whether it really meets this

5

Court's standings tests, here's what Petitioners said

6

about this exact scenario when they were in the court of

7

appeals:

8

of partial deregulation is, quote, "a hypothetical NEPA

9

controversy," end quote, that, quote, "rests upon

They said that the prospect of a future grant

10

contingent future events that may not occur as

11

anticipated or, indeed, may not occur at all."

12

I take that to be the very definition of

13

what is not imminent for purposes of this Court's

14

standing cases.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Could I go back to

16

something you said a while ago, that "likely" does not

17

mean more likely than not?

18

MR. ROBBINS:

Yes.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's -- I thought

20

that would be obvious.

21

to win, that means they are more likely than you.

22

MR. ROBBINS:

If I say your friends are likely

Well, I -- I -- you know, I

23

think the -- the answer is contextual, but in this

24

context, "likely" for purposes of an injunction,

25

Mr. Chief Justice, has I think never been understood to

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

mean more likely than not.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you have -- I --

3

I was surprised that this apparently hasn't been decided

4

over the however many years we’ve had this standard.

5

Is there a case that says "likely" does not mean more

6

likely than not?

7

MR. ROBBINS:

No.

But there are cases -- I

8

mean, the issue has not been addressed by this Court one

9

way or the other.

I would say City of Los Angeles v.

10

Lyons and the Amoco case both used the phrase

11

"sufficiently likely," and the lower courts have

12

understood that to mean sufficiently likely in light of

13

the nature of the harm.
Consider, if we were talking about the

14
15

probability of the contamination of the water supply of

16

New York City, would anybody suppose that the -- if the

17

probability were 10 percent rather than 50.9 percent,

18

that no one could go into court and get an injunction?

19

Neither the private litigants -- you know, put them to

20

one side.

21

injunctive relief would be critically hampered if such

22

an order came about, and --

This is not the end of the world.

The most it does is make it difficult for

MR. ROBBINS:

No, I was --- from poisoned water?

I -- I thought -- I -- it had

suggest that it does not make sense to adopt a “more

2

that from contamination or is it just from -- from

3

consumer choice; i.e., that that's what farmers like

4

because it's easy to grow?

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And what happened with corn?

You -- you -- you said -- gee, I was unaware -- I’ve

7

been eating corn all this time.

The fact is the judge had before him

Now, Justice Ginsburg, it is correct that

the draft EIS says this is coming.

47
Alderson Reporting Company

But I -- I think the upshot is that if that

is the only respect that the injunction exceeds the

limit of the vacatur, I don't understand how the

things that they argue, which is:

Yes.

wrote the opinion for the Court.

Where there are

22

overlapping provisions, or for -- you know, two pieces

23

of law that have overlapping effect, and you challenge

problem.

That's where we are today.

7

Well, it's kind of

artificial to separate the two out.

I mean, it's one

judgment, and they say they’re intertwined.

The

10

injunction is based on the vacatur.

11

challenge the injunction, you can't say, well, they’re

12

not challenging the vacatur.
MR. ROBBINS:

13

And so if they

Well, I -- I'm not sure that

14

it's fair to say that the injunction is based on the

15

vacatur.

16

Chief Justice, that every appeal is from a judgment.

mean, that’s more or less -- excepting unusual

circumstances, that's the only thing you can appeal.

I

But if I were, for example, appealing a

can't get a dismissal in the court of appeals, because I

No.

3

The way we appeal things in this

country is we write sentences in our briefs about -- we

write questions presented; we present questions to this

6

Court.

7

arguments have been smuggled under the tent through the

8

camel's nose in this case, when I look at the questions

9

presented in this case, you’ve got to really squint to

And I will say that, although all manner of

10

find even some of the arguments they have made, much

11

less this one, which they have not made.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but we have to

13

decide -- for you to prevail on that, we have to decide

14

that the injunction does no more than the vacatur.

15

MR. ROBBINS:

No.

I think what we -- I

16

think the question is whether the relief that they are

17

seeking is separately prohibited by the vacatur and

18

whether that excess, which may arguably go beyond the

19

vacatur, is sufficiently imminent to meet this Court's

20

standing cases.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -- so the

22

district judge was wrong.

23

the injunction adds nothing to the vacatur, he should

24

have ended by saying it's vacated.

25

MR. ROBBINS:

He should have -- if you say

I think that was an available

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

option.

2

other things, the -- the parties were arguing about

3

whether the -- the injunction should be broader than the

4

vacatur.

5

government has told us in its brief, to decline to

6

vacate at all.

7

I think the reason he didn't is that, among

And, of course, he had the authority, as the

So it's not as if the remedy phase had no

8

point.

It had a point.

It's was all up for grabs.

9

in the end he issued a judgment with multiple parts,

But

10

only a subset of which Petitioners elected to appeal.

11

That was their choice.

12

it seems to me surpassingly odd to draw this Court into

13

a close reading -- and this goes back to one of the

14

first questions of this morning, from Justice Alito --

15

the question about digging into this, what the district

16

court appropriately called the voluminous record of --

17

of -- of declarations and evidence.

18

just a -- I think a passingly -- a passing strange use

19

of this Court's resources, to dig into those materials,

20

when in point of fact --

21

But now having made that choice,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

have to do that.

23

lower courts did it.

That's an --

We -- we don't necessarily

We just have to decide whether the

24

MR. ROBBINS:

Well --

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, if we concluded

51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that they didn't do it, that would -- that would be enough,

2

wouldn't it?

3

We wouldn't have to do it ourselves.

MR. ROBBINS:

Respectfully, Justice Scalia,

4

I think the only way you can say they didn't do it is

5

by doing it yourself; because they said they did it.

6

look at pages --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They also said stuff which

suggests that they didn't do it.
MR. ROBBINS:

Well, I -- I won't -- and I am

10

not here defending every particular line in some of the

11

opinions, but there is no question that at 69a through

12

71a of the petition appendix, the district court

13

articulated the standard four-part injunction test.

14

court of appeals articulated it as well, said that the

15

evidence was sufficient.

16

there is sufficient evidence to warrant a finding of a

17

likelihood of irreparable harm, reviewable under an

18

abuse of discretion standard.

The

And, indeed, in this record,

Your --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If you're -- if you

20

are right that the injunction does nothing, they don't

21

have standing because of that, we should throw the

22

injunction out.

23

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, I -- I -- I think, given

24

that standing is a threshold question, I don't see how

25

the Court could do that.

I think the Court could say:

things as the Petitioners are demanding from this Court.

MR. ROBBINS:

the government I think has the same vacatur problem, but

13

I don't think that's a burden I have to meet, because

14

under -- I think it's Diamond v. Charles, the -- the

standing has to be by the party that called upon this

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In deciding irreparable

harm, what weight if any should be given to the

proposition that there was an environmental impact

regulation violation, as opposed to just a regular suit

between, say, two farmers over a nuisance?

22

do we give to the fact that -- let's assume -- there’s a --

a violation of the rule requiring an environmental

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That is not alone a

sufficient harm to justify an injunction, is it?
MR. ROBBINS:

3

No.

And no -- no one is

4

claiming that an EIS violation standing alone gives

5

rise to an injunction, but it carries some important

6

weight.

7

notwithstanding the red light, the answer to the

8

question is the fact that they violated the EIS

requirement tells us at a minimum that this was a

significant -- a major Federal program that had a

proposed measures.

it makes clear that the government's opposed measures

5

were intended to replace the deregulation order.

vacatur and the proposed measures are one and the same.

On page 184 of the petition appendix,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So the

I have a real problem if

8

the whole appeal is over whether or not the district

9

court should have accepted the agency's views.

The

10

agency has told us that it has side-stepped going

11

through all of the regular -- all of the administrative

12

steps it was required to.

13

give notice, but it needed to do some form of an EA and

14

get comments and do other things.

15

that.

It may not have needed to

16

MR. GARRE:

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And it didn't do

Well, it -So how can we say that

18

the district court acted improperly, when it's the

19

government who is asking the district court to forgive

20

it from doing something it's legally required to do?

21

MR. GARRE:

The district court at least

22

acted improperly in enjoining the agency from doing that

23

on remand.

24

improperly --

25

And if that's all the Court thinks it did

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, no.

don’t see that argument either in your brief or theirs.

MR. GARRE:

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, it's part -I see only the argument

4

that it erred by not accepting something that the

5

government had no power to do outside of the regulatory

6

scheme.

7

MR. GARRE:

It's -- our view is it's part

8

and parcel of the vacatur order.

The district court

9

looked at this in the context of the injunction and

10

posed those traditional factors in examining the scope

11

of relief.
JUSTICE ALITO:

How do you answer

I'm sorry to interrupt.

How

do you answer Mr. Robbins's imminence argument?
MR. GARRE:

18

In terms of going back for the

19

imminence, we’re operating under this injunction which is

20

unlawful.

this erroneous injunction.

the farmers that are challenging this --

With respect, it's -- it's

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But wouldn't it be the

same problem for the farmers if we had only the

2

deregulation decision vacated?

3

until the agency then gives them permission to do

4

something.

5

MR. GARRE:

They can't do anything

If you go back, the agency

6

could allow those measures to be implemented and that

7

would solve --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that's going to take

time.

10

MR. GARRE:

-- our problem.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I mean, it's going to take

12

time, and you have the EIS on track within a year.

you going to do this other operation in 6 months?

MR. GARRE:

So are

Not necessarily,

15

Justice Ginsburg, but, with respect, we’ve been

16

operating under this erroneous injunction for 3 years.

This Court should say it's erroneous.

There

21

are no instances in this record of any cross-pollination

22

with hay, only a couple of -- a few isolated with

23

respect to seed, and their harm really boils down to the

24

question of their psychological objection to genetically

engineered alfalfa.

That harm is not cognizable under
