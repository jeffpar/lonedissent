ORAL ARGUMENT OF D. KENT SAFRIET

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11

MR. SAFRIET:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

Today we ask this Court to expressly

13

recognize that a State court decision, unpredictable in

14

terms of relevant precedents, which redefines

15

century-old property rights to no longer exist, violates

16

the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.

17

The Florida Supreme Court suddenly and

18

dramatically redefined littoral property rights,

19

converting oceanfront property into oceanview property

20

to avoid the finding of a taking.

21

context of a beach restoration project which could have

22

been accomplished without taking any private property at

23

all.

24

legislative and executive branches cannot violate the

25

Fifth Amendment, we see no reason why the judicial

It did so in the

Given this Court's jurisprudence that a State's

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

branch should be treated any differently.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought your basic

3

position in the litigation in Florida was that the

4

Florida legislation violated the takings protection, and

5

so it's kind of strange to switch your target from the

6

legislature, which enacted this measure, and then say,

7

because the judiciary upheld it, the judiciary somehow

8

is complicit in this violation by the legislature

9

implemented by the administrative offices.

10

MR. SAFRIET:

That is correct, Your Honor.

11

Below, the case was litigated as one of a taking by the

12

legislature when it passed the Act.

13

When it passed the Beach and Shore

14

Preservation Act, it contained a provision within

15

section 161.141, which is a savings clause, that said to

16

the extent the beach restoration cannot be accomplished

17

without taking property rights, the requesting

18

authorities have to use eminent domain proceedings to

19

take those rights.

20

At the First District Court of Appeal, they

21

agreed with us that the littoral rights were being taken

22

by the Act of the legislature and that those had to be

23

compensated for.

24

Court, again, all of the parties were arguing those

25

issues, whether there was a physical taking of these

When we arrived at the Florida Supreme

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

rights or a regulatory taking of these rights by the Act

2

and whether the savings clause would apply.

3

To everybody's shock, the Florida Supreme

4

Court said:

We're going to go back to step one and

5

decide you don't have any littoral rights.

6

legislature didn't eliminate any protected littoral

7

rights that you thought you once had for over a hundred

8

years as the relevant precedents in common law indicate.

9

So it was that decision of the Florida Supreme Court,

The

10

that said you have -- no longer have property, that

11

gives rise to the issue before this Court is, can the

12

Florida Supreme Court redefine those 100-year-old rights

13

to no longer exist?

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Applied in a new

15

situation.

16

involved here with the beach restoration project.

17

-- the precedent did not involve the kind of situation

18

that this case presents.

19

MR. SAFRIET:

It was never the kind of situation

Yes, Your Honor.

There is no

20

precedent with respect to the Beach and Shore

21

Preservation Act as it has ever been applied.

22

concede that.

23

The

We do

However, there are two fundamental

24

principles of Florida law that have existed for more

25

than a hundred years, and those are property that must

2

must remain in contact with the mean high-water line to

3

possess common law littoral rights.

4

is not there, there are no common law littoral rights.

5

Common law littoral rights are constitutionally

6

protected and cannot be taken without due process and

7

just compensation.

8
9
10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If that connection

Well, they're -- they're

eliminated -- at least the right of contact with the
water can be eliminated by an avulsion, right?

11

When there's -- when there's avulsion, even

12

at common law and under Florida law, it -- it can happen

13

that some land between the property owner and -- and the

14

water will be owned by the State.

15
16

MR. SAFRIET:
Under the --

17
18
19

That is correct, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, why wasn't this an

avulsion?
MR. SAFRIET:

Well, because the avulsion in

20

this case, Your Honor, was the hurricanes that the State

21

cites as the reason for the beaches being washed away,

22

and -- and it was --

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, well, well, well.

24

There were -- there were two avulsions.

25

avulsion of its being washed away and the other was the
6
Alderson Reporting Company

One was the

Official

1

-- the rapid replacement of sand.

2

natural, gradual phenomenon.

3

MR. SAFRIET:

That -- that is not a

That is right, Your Honor, but

4

the -- there is no case law in Florida or no principle

5

that says avulsion can occur by artificial means.

6

there is -- the beach restoration, where they placed

7

sand on the beach, is not avulsion.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So

If there’s no case law, it

seems to me you've lost your case.

10

MR. SAFRIET:

No, the case law specifically

11

says that avulsion is a result of natural occurrences,

12

by the action of the wind and the water.

13

avulsion is in Florida and has been -- you know, for at

14

least 50 years, I believe.

15

That's what

It's --

JUSTICE BREYER:

They have a new situation.

16

It's sort of like an avulsion.

17

accretion.

18

about a hundred years -- it seemed to me some dictum in

19

a case called Sand Key, which does say that the upland

20

property owner has the right to touch the water.

21

It's sort of like an

The only precedent of -- you keep talking

So in this case, the Florida Supreme Court

22

says the purpose of that was to make certain that the

23

upland property owner could go to the water.

24

here we have a case that assures he can go to the water,

25

and they have a new situation, which, as I think
7
Alderson Reporting Company

And so

Official

1

Justice Scalia said, looks an awful lot like an

2

avulsion, though of course there are differences.

3

So it sounds like a typical common law

4

situation.

5

old precedent, and they reached the result they did.

6

Now, what's your response to that?

7

argument the other side makes.

8
9

A new situation arises.

MR. SAFRIET:

You try to apply

Because that's the

The response to that, Your

Honor, is the doctrine of avulsion -- as part of the

10

doctrine of avulsion is the doctrine -- or the right to

11

reclaim what was lost by the landowner.

12

avulsion event occurs, the landowner that has lost

13

property has a right under common law to reclaim what

14

they lost.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

So when an

You didn't lose any.

16

It just went out the front door there.

17

here, and the new avulsion comes in and extends it

18

further.

19

the right to touch the water.

20

you in effect have that right because you can walk right

21

over it and get to the water.

22

You didn't lose one inch.

MR. SAFRIET:

The land ended

All you lost was

But the court here says

What -- what was lost in this

23

case, Your Honor, is the right to contact the mean high-

24

water line, and I think there's a distinction between

25

the right to contact the mean high-water line and the

the former issue, contact with the mean high-water line.

to put up a hot dog stand on this new land, would you

17

have the right to tell them they can't?

18
19
20

MR. SAFRIET:

Absolutely not, Your Honor,

and that's the point I was getting to.
JUSTICE BREYER:

You say “absolutely not.”

21

I thought there was a provision in this law that said

22

they cannot put anything on that strip which destroys

23

your right of enjoyment of the upland right.

24

Counsel, before this

legislation, in the seaward side of the land that

MR. SAFRIET:

If somebody wanted to put one

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And someone could have

stood there, a boat could have docked there, assuming

that it -- it was a shallow boat.

15

You had no control over anyone placing

16

anything on the seaside submerged lands that belonged to

17

the State, outside of whatever regulations the State

the case was litigated, was assumed to be located

MR. SAFRIET:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes, Your Honor.
So after this project

13

finishes, that hot water -- that hot dog vendor will be

14

on stateside land, correct?

15

MR. SAFRIET:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That is correct, Your Honor.
No different than what

17

exists today, before the legislation, which is if the

hot dog vendor wanted to sit in a foot of water, it

19

could have?

MR. SAFRIET:

It certainly could sit in a

foot of water.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

All right.

So none of

24

else has been changed.

What you're arguing is that --

12
Alderson Reporting Company

the Florida State Supreme Court described as the

2

contingent future possibility that the high-water mark

3

might change and you could push that hot dog vendor back

That is correct, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, such -- such

boats floating in -- in the water below the mean high­

water mark are available with respect to all littoral

10

properties.

Isn't that right?

11

MR. SAFRIET:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That is right, Your Honor.
But what can't happen with

13

other littoral property is that folks can't come in and

14

lay down beach blankets and occupy that sand, right, so

15

that you have open sand in front of -- in front of your

16

house?

11

MR. SAFRIET:

The foreshore, Your Honor, is

12

typically the land area between the mean high-water line

13

and the low high-water line, and depending on the tide

14

cycles of the day, some of that foreshore is dry, and

15

then at other times --

You don't have people laying their blankets in

2

the water to enjoy that beach.

3

And what we're talking about here is the

4

exclusive right to use the dry sand area that stays dry

5

all of the time in our case, which in our case was a

6

200-foot stretch of beach before this project began, and

7

we had 200 feet of beach, and we had the right to

8

exclude commercial vendors or anybody else from that

9

property.

10

Now what we have after that, according to

11

this project, is another 80 feet to 100 feet of dry sand

12

beach owned by the State where the landowners have no

13

ability to exclude commercial vendors or any other

14

obnoxious uses of that property.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Who owns that land?

I

16

mean, when it was submerged it belonged to the State.

17

And is it your position that the owners in your

18

organization, that they have title to that land that was

19

once owned by the State?

20

MR. SAFRIET:

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

21

It's our position that the State, as a matter of public

22

use under the Takings Clause, can condemn that property

23

and make a public beach in front of a private one.

24

absolutely can do that.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

No, I mean -- I mean,

5

that the landowners own that new 80-foot stretch of

6

beach now, as it currently exists.

7

own to the erosion control line, which is the property

8

boundary that the State created in this case.

9

10

80-foot strip of beach.

11

here is the State to go through eminent domain

12

proceedings to pay us compensation for the loss of

13

littoral rights that they're taking by creating this

14

public strip of beach.

15

And what we're trying to obtain

Now, the State may at the end of the day

16

say, well, we're not going to claim title to that; we're

17

going to reinstate your boundary as the mean high-water

18

line -- that would be 80 feet further out -- and no

19

compensation, in that case, would be due.

20

But --

It would be -- what

21

would your position be, assuming you still have title,

I mean, if

9

10

as it would any other land, absent some type of easement

11

or reservation of our agreement with the landowners that

12

give them greater rights and --

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The State gave you some

14

quid pro quo for this, which is to say this new sand is

15

projected to last 6 years, has to be replaced regularly,

16

because your -- your property is being eroded, which is

17

the reason the State went into this.

18

has given you in exchange is that if and when there is

19

further erosion, you will continue to own up to whatever

Let me ask you this

question on Florida valuation.

15

there's a cause of action for a taking.

16

beachfront area, beachfront home, in which there's a

17

hurricane and there's a loss of the beach and a sudden

18

drop, so that it's now a 60-foot -- a 60-foot drop.

19

State comes in and says the only way we can fix this

20

is to extend the beach and make it a larger beach on

21

what was formerly our submerged land.

22

that.

23

Assume you prevail,
You have a

And it does that

Under -- and it -- and it has the same rule.
Under your view, is the State required to

24

pay you for the loss of your right of contact to the

25

beach, your littoral right, because there's let's say

2

offset that against the enhanced value to your property

3

by reason of the fact that they've saved it from further

4

erosion and have given you a beach where there was none

5

before?

6

MR. SAFRIET:

Are they entitled to

Yes, Your Honor, they are able

7

to offset that, and the -- the statute provides for that

8

offsetting such that in an eminent domain proceedings

9

whatever value the landowners lost as a result of their

10

-- losing their contact with the mean high-water line,

11

that any benefit provided by the additional sand would

12

be offset --

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So the enhancement from

14

the post-project benefit is a credit to the State in the

15

takings action?

16

MR. SAFRIET:

That -- that is according to

17

the statute that was passed, Your Honor.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Did any of these beachfront

19

owners think this was a good deal, that the State has

20

prevented further erosion of their land and, you know,

21

the price they pay for that is that they have this

22

60-foot stretch that -- that the public can use, and

23

that may wash away in 6 years anyway, and if they're

24

lucky the State won't have enough money to put it back?

lost when we lose connection to the mean high-water

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Let me go ahead and address some issues that

have come up about Florida law.

Number one, this idea

3

of artificial avulsion that was discussed earlier, the

4

Bryant v. Peppe case, which cites the Martin -- that was

5

discussed in the Martin case, talks about when the State

6

comes in on its own property and either lowers the water

7

or, in this case, puts sand on the -- on the State side

8

of the property line, that that's an artificial

9

avulsion, the State retains title to its State lands,

10

the upland owner, the private property owner retains

11

ownership of their land.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I suppose it depends

13

on -- or maybe not -- how quickly it all happens.

14

mean, if the State project is such that they add a foot

15

a year, is that an avulsion or accretion?

16

MR. MAKAR:

the line.

whenever the State does it, it's an avulsion?
MR. MAKAR:

If it's on -- if it's on its

property, that's absolutely the case.

I thought

avulsion by definition is a sudden change.

justifiable under Florida law.

I'm saying they point to Sand Key.

Tell me if I'm right, and

19

if I am right, that that is meant to be the answer,

21

MR. MAKAR:

Sure.

What they're citing to is

22

some dicta in Sand Key that had nothing to do with the

23

holding of that case, and if you try to go back and look

24

at the citations to the cases that Sand Key cites for

25

that proposition of contact with the water, none of them
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

have to do with contact with water.

2

Instead, the most important point is to look

3

at Martin v. Busch, which was a case where the State

4

lowered the water in a lake, the upland owners at -- the

5

property line was determined not to have moved, they

6

didn't have any contact with the water any longer, and

7

the submerged sovereignty lands became the State's

8

property.

9

There's no right of contact there.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

It’s --

Sand Key's statement

10

strikes one as -- as correct simply because I think

11

that's -- that's the view of the common law.

12

don't think that's unique or distinctive to Florida.

13

think it would be very strange to have a principle that

14

all the -- all the littoral owner gets is a right to

15

access the water and not the right to be on the water,

16

to have his property on the water.

17

I -- I

I think -- I think in every State,

18

beachfront owners would be astounded to learn that

19

that's the case.

20

So, I -- you know, I thought that Sand Key

21

was just expressing what -- what was the common law.

22

And the notion that -- that the only purpose of the

23

contact with the water is so that you can have access,

24

that is -- is that not silly?

25

MR. MAKAR:

No.

Well, two points here I

I

would like to make.

2

an avulsive event that added sand on the State's

3

property along the beach line, so now we have the

4

property line not changing, it's exactly where it was

5

before, but now we have, say, 75 feet of sand, new sand

6

seaward, over the State's property.

7

property --

9

Number one, let's assume there was

question.

That's the State's

But that's not the

I mean, you just said that, let's assume the

10

-- assuming the property line doesn't change.

11

side is saying the property line is the mean high-water

12

line, and so if you -- whoever adds sand, the State,

13

mother nature, you dumping it -- I guess you can't do

14

that, but whoever adds it, the property line is the mean

15

high-water line.

16

MR. MAKAR:

The other

But -- but -- well -- but under

17

this avulsive event where there is sand added seaward,

18

the contact by the upland owner with the water no longer

19

exists, and that's been on the books in Florida for --

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, but that's

21

because you think the property line is the ECL rather

22

than the MHWL.

23

MR. MAKAR:

I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.

24

What I'm talking about is put the Act aside and just say

25

at common law in Florida.

If the sand is added through
39

avulsive events, the upland owner has no contact with

2

the water any longer.

the Florida Act is so solicitous of protecting the

They certainly have access.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And

You go through

They have a section -Would that person still be

considered a littoral owner?
MR. MAKAR:

That was my second point.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

After there has been the

11

avulsive event that separates him from the ocean by 60

12

feet of State-owned land, would he still be a -- a

13

riparian owner?

14

I thought --

MR. MAKAR:

Absolutely, absolutely.

And

15

that's a major misnomer in this case, is that the upland

16

owner here, even after the beach restoration project,

17

has riparian littoral property.

18

to create a huge beach in front of -- of privately owned

9

I make a list of what they say in effect provides, not

10

perfectly, but provides, roughly, the same kind of

11

protection that the Sand Key statement provided.

12

One, you can go to the water; two, you have

13

a right of ingress and egress, if that's any different

from the first.

11

they have to set out what the width of the berm will be,

MR. MAKAR:

they have no right to contact with the water, and this

5

accretion right is --

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Again, that is what

7

the whole case is about, whether they have a right to

8

contact the water or not.

here that the reason they don't under Florida law is in

the question that was asked of your colleague?

That is,

9

here we have an organization representing several

10

landowners.

11

beachfront owners in these communities -- what their

view is, that they are benefited, that they are harmed?

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

6

--

hypothetical, or a

permanent oceanography museum?

7

MR. MAKAR:

Sure, Justice Kennedy.

We have

8

cases in Florida, for example, where a bridge was built

9

entirely across the view of the -- of the river, and the

10

upland owner in that situation had a total impairment of

their right to view, and that's compensable.

Justice Kennedy, is that if there's a substantial

So on behalf of the

3

State, you concede if any of this list -- these -- the

4

list of good things that the land owner gets, if the

5

legislature next year takes them away, that would be a

6

taking?

7

MR. MAKAR:

Sure, if they took away the --

8

the swath of littoral rights or a substantial portion,

9

that would be highly problematic and likely be a taking.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you think that either

11

all of the time or some of the time a public beach

water would be a substantial impairment of the upland

owner's rights?

No, no, no.

owns the beach, and let me make this analogy.

point.

19

okay because there's a protection against unreasonable

use.

21

what do you call them, port-a-johns and hot dog stands

5

wants to build a nuclear power plant, and they say, you

have to pay us.

7

the State upholds it on the ground there is an implicit

easement under Blackstone to take land for power plants

without paying for it; it's called the power plant

easement.

Now, in such a case, it would be the

judicial taking because their ground is not -- whatever

you normally have, but their ground is you never had

that property right in the first place.

15

Now, how -- if that ever were to happen --

that ever were to happen, wouldn't there have to be a

remedy under the Constitution for it?

On the other hand, if the State came along
once a year, on one day, and added a foot, that would

perceptible because the State would have added a foot of

property.

MR. KNEEDLER:

I -- I think it is

point.

This is not a -- a unique notion in Florida law.

This Court's decision in

Hughes v. Washington, which dealt with accretion,

11

responded to the -- to the point that was -- that was

12

made there and said, well, the -- the littoral property

13

right is vulnerable anyway because the owner of the

14

adjacent submerged lands can always take action on his

15

own lands that could affect what the upland property

16

owner did.

17

And this -- and this Court said, yes, that's

18

right, but we're talking, here, about natural causes.

19

And in -- in Hughes, the Court cited two cases, one in

20

Washington State, for example, where the -- where there

21

was an absolute right to fill the submerged lands even

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF D. KENT SAFRIET

23

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

24

MR. SAFRIET:

Thank you, Your Honor.

25

First, Martin v. Busch does not stand for
61
Alderson Reporting Company

1

the principles that the Respondents suggest they do.

2

The court in Sand Key said, and in -- and in

3

distinguishing the Martin v. Busch case, and I quote,

4

"Our subsequent decisions show there was no intent to

5

change common law principles regarding the right to

6

accretion and relictions in Martin v. Busch."

7

And even if it did stand for that principle,

8

the Martin v. Busch case didn't discuss whether the

9

landowner was entitled to compensation for the severance

10

of their waterfront property as a result of the lowering

11

of the water.

12

What also must be noted here is the State

beach had been put in, then their deed would be

2

changed, wouldn't it?

3

MR. SAFRIET:

Temporarily, Your Honor,

4

because under the doctrine of reclamation, they can

5

reclaim the boundary line that they lost, just as if in

6

a case where the hurricane washes sand away, the

7

landowner, under common law, the doctrine of

8

reclamation, can bring in sand where the water is to

9

reconnect to that mean high-water line that would be

10

underwater following a hurricane.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, how does that work?

12

13

reclamation, they can reclaim the boundary line.

that's by depositing new sand where the water is to

22

reach the mean high-water line, where it was prior to

23

the hurricane.

25

If

They can do that.

Conversely, if sand is washed up as a result
of a hurricane, they can remove the sand to bring the

MR. SAFRIET:

That wouldn't be State -- they

7

reclamation in this case.
