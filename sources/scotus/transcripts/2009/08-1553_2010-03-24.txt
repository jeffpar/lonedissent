ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. BALLENGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

From its enactment in 1906 until very

17

not discuss the Carmack Amendment, this Court agreed

18

unanimously on both reasoning and a result that are

19

flatly inconsistent with Respondents’ arguments here.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought the government

21

told us in this -- in that case that Carmack wasn't in

22

the case because it was either waived or something.

23

the case was considered on the basis of, on the one hand,

24

COGSA and, on the other, the law of 50 States.

25

MR. BALLENGER:

That's correct, Justice.
5

Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official

1

The United States represented to this Court that -- that

2

Carmack was not in the case, either because it was

3

waived or because the traffic was moving under 49 U.S.C.

4

section 10709, which of course is true here as well.

5

Our view has always been that this Court

6

wouldn't have granted certiorari purely on the basis of

7

a waiver.

8

Kirby was that it's very important to foreign trade and

9

to the uniformity of rules on a through shipment.

10

But in any event, this Court's reasoning in

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but uniformity is

11

one thing when you’re talking about 50 States and

12

another when it's just two Federal statutes.

13

MR. BALLENGER:

That's absolutely true, Your

14

Honor.

15

Federal statutes have been construed harmoniously not to

16

overlap in this particular situation.

17

commerce is governed by the Carriage of Goods at Sea

18

Act, and the Carmack Amendment has always governed

19

purely domestic traffic and exports to Canada and

20

Mexico.

5

6

language they used or that boilerplate?

7

I mean, the language that

MR. BALLENGER:

Your Honor, I think that

8

this Court's task, as always, is to read the statute as

9

a whole, which includes that language that Your Honor

10

characterizes as boilerplate and also includes the

11

language that we are here to construe.

13

And you would

So let's look at the -- at the present

argument and your pre-1978 argument?

5

MR. BALLENGER:

They are, Your Honor.

The

6

simplest way to resolve this case is that the present

7

language, even taken on its face, requires a receiving

8

carrier that is a rail carrier.

9

"K" Line is the receiving carrier here.

10

They are not a rail carrier.

11

have long held that merely subcontracting for common

12

carrier service does not make you a common carrier.

13

This Court held that in the American Railway Express

14

case.

15

CSX/Sea-Land matter in 1987, where they held that the

16

ocean carrier Sea-Land was not a rail carrier simply

17

because it subcontracted for inland rail transportation

18

and provided carrier containers to the inland rail

19

carrier.

Carmack draws

"Receiving carrier" has

11

MR. BALLENGER:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Correct.
And so that's what it has

13

to do, is a bill of lading for property it receives.

14

And you are saying "receives" means receives from the

shipper.

16

MR. BALLENGER:

MR. BALLENGER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

It has to mean that, because

23

otherwise, if you read it to mean receives from another

1

well as a connecting or delivering carrier and required

2

to issue its own bill of lading, which would turn the

3

historic purposes of Carmack on its head.

4

The purpose of Carmack was to require the

5

first carrier in the chain to issue a single through

6

bill of lading to the destination that would govern the

7

whole voyage under uniform, consistent liability terms.

8

No one else in the chain is supposed to issue a bill of

9

lading, so there’s only one receiving carrier.

It's

10

the first carrier who deals directly with the shipper.

11

If you look at the venue provision, you can see that the

12

statute uses the term "originating carrier"

13

interchangeably with "receiving carrier," and it

14

provides venue over that carrier only at the point of

15

origin of the shipment.

that Union Pacific was the receiving carrier --

That would make absolutely no

In this circumstance you would say, I suppose,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

I -- I always thought

20

that the purpose of Carmack was to ensure rail

21

responsibility, rail carrier responsibility, so that it

22

was one bill of lading with respect to all railroad

23

connections.

SUPPORTING PETITIONERS
MR. YANG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I’d like to address a few of the

17

questions that have come up already.

Justice Sotomayor,

18

you asked what Supreme Court decision addresses the

19

receiving carrier.

20

address receiving carriers and the nature of the

21

receiving carrier as the initial carrier that receives

22

goods from the shipper.

23

Power Company, 1947, is probably the best, but that

24

traces its way back all the way to the 1910s, Galveston

These cases are largely cited at our brief at

Regarding the geographic scope of Carmack on

the current text, we believe that the current text,

5

which is reproduced in the petition appendix at 69a --

6

if you look at the combination of both the first and the

7

third sentences of Carmack, we believe that that

8

reproduces the historic scope as encompassing only

9

domestic transportation, purely domestic transportation,

10

and transportation to an adjacent foreign country when

11

it's an export.

12

The first sentence requires that the rail

13

carrier be providing transportation or service subject

14

to the jurisdiction of the board and issue a receipt or

15

bill of lading.

16

very beginning, its core purpose, was to allow a shipper

17

to sue the initial carrier.

18

responsible for the entire shipment.

19

carriers were deemed to be agents of the initial carrier,

20

and, therefore, there was an easy defendant for the

21

shipper, who dealt directly with that shipper -- that

22

carrier and received a bill of lading from that carrier

23

to sue.

Both the petition appendices are the

So I'm looking down at -- (a)(2) provides

23

that the jurisdiction of the STB applies only to

24

transportation into the United States when that's

25

between -- you know, part of a larger transit between
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the U.S. and a foreign country or even purely

2

domestically.

3

So, a shipper -- or a carrier that is

4

subject to STB jurisdiction has to be providing this

5

U.S. transportation when it issues the bill of lading.

6

So the -- again, the central purpose was to provide a

7

carrier by which -- against whom the shipper can bring

8

suit in a convenient forum, the person that the shipper

9

dealt with.

And that's now reflected in section -- the

10

forum provision of Carmack, which is subsection (d)(2),

11

it provides that a suit under Carmack may only be

12

brought against the originating rail carrier in the

13

judicial district in which the point of origin is

14

located.

15

that's a U.S. district court or a State court.

Those -- and the prior provision says that

16
17

Carmack itself anchors the transportation
as starting in the United States.

18
19

And then the third sentence explains the
remainder of the historic scope.

20
21
22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The third sentence --

Where -- we’re looking

where, now?
MR. YANG:

This is back to 69(a).

It’s

23

Carmack, third sentence in subsection (b).

It defines

24

the liability under Carmack.

25

under this section is for damage “caused by the receiving

carrier, the delivering carrier, or another rail carrier

2

over whose line or route the property is transited in

3

the United States or from a place in the United States

4

to a place in an adjacent foreign country.”

5

So, what that does is that provides the

6

center for the two bookends.

7

originating carrier, the receiving carrier that receives

8

the goods in the United States, provides the bill of

9

lading to the shipper.

10

The first bookend is the

The second bookend is the delivering

carrier, and in between -- remember Carmack was intended

12

to cover the entire carriage as a unified whole.

13

in-between is transportation in the United States or

14

export transportation from the United States to a point

15

in a foreign country.

16

The

We believe that that text, read as a whole,

17

reflects the historic scope of Carmack that's existed

18

since 1915 when it was extended beyond purely domestic

19

transportation.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But why -- why doesn't the

22

say is true, that should be the delivering rail carrier

“transported” actually applies to the receiving and

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

22

25

MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
It does not take great mental gymnastics to
read the plain language of this statute and resolve it
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the way the Ninth Circuit did in favor of Respondents.

2

The case is controlled by the plain language

3

of several Federal statutes, and they have been adverted

4

to, to some extent.

5

the Court that in 2-1/2 pages of our merits brief,

6

starting at page 26 and going over to page 28, we not

7

only cite the full language in full of the Carmack

8

Amendment and the jurisdictional provision of the STB,

9

but explain how Union Pacific is a delivering carrier

But I would like to point out to

10

within the meaning of the Carmack Amendment; under the

11

plain terms of the statute, they are liable for the

12

loss; the Carmack Amendment applies to their receipt of

13

the property; and the train derailment which was caused

14

by their negligence comes within the plain terms of the

15

Carmack Amendment.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then under that view, I

17

guess that -- that any intermodal transport, China, all

18

the goods coming from China, which tend to move under a

19

single bill of lading, as soon as they get to the United

20

States and go on a train for 50 miles, a new bill of

21

lading must issue?
MR. FREDERICK:

22
23

No.

In fact, this Carmack

Amendment --

24

25

MR. FREDERICK:

Why?
-- explicitly says, quote:

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

"Failure to issue a receipt or bill of lading does not

2

affect the liability of a rail carrier."

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

they don't have to issue --

7

MR. FREDERICK:

Carmack --

All right, so you're saying

They do not have to issue a

separate -JUSTICE BREYER:

Fine.

If they don't have

8

to issue a separate receipt, what we’re talking about

9

is the bill of lading that was issued by the ship.

10

MR. FREDERICK:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's correct.
All right.

Now, if that's

12

correct and if the ship -- the only one that has to do

13

that, it says, is a rail carrier, and a rail carrier is

14

a person providing common carrier rail transport.

15

then that's defined to include intermodal equipment used

16

by or in connection with a railroad.

17

understanding -- which I'm asking you for correction

18

if I don’t -- is that the argument here is the ship is

19

providing intermodal equipment used by or in connection

20

with a railroad.

21

MR. FREDERICK:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

And my

That's correct.
And it's the words "used by

23

or in connection with" that I am focusing on, because to

24

apply those words here seems to me to bring every

25

by people throughout the world are all going to have to

5

apply to meet the terms of the Carmack Amendment, which

6

had the purposes of railroads in the United States, and

7

that's going to be a nightmare.

And it means that the bill of ladings issued

8
9

MR. FREDERICK:

No, it won't,

Justice Breyer.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, first, is it true what

11

I said?

12

contrary to the purpose and a nightmare?

And, second, if it is true why isn't it way

13

MR. FREDERICK:

It is not -- it is true and

14

not true, but for different reasons.

15

take a moment to explain, because I think it is

16

important.

17

And if I could

In 1978, the plain language of the statute

18

defined what the STB's jurisdiction is.

19

dispute that the last part of the jurisdictional

20

provision is the STB jurisdiction when a -- a shipment

21

is in, quote, "between the United States and a place in

22

a foreign country," but the STB only has jurisdiction to

23

the extent the transportation occurs in the United

24

States.

25

They do not

So it is true that imports into the United
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

States are covered by the Carmack Amendment, but only to

2

the extent of the transportation being within the United

3

States.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, but why don't they have to

5

issue a bill of lading?

That's what they say.

So every

6

company, the Finnish company, Chinese, every company,

7

every shipowner, even if he’s never been to the

8

United States -- sad for him, but nonetheless -- every

9

one of those is going to have to issue a bill of

10

lading, whatever meeting whatever requirements are

11

there, and we know at least one requirement you think

12

applies.

13

MR. FREDERICK:

Let me go back -- let me go

6

broad definition, and I would have thought we traced

the -- that section and where it's exempt, because they got

MR. FREDERICK:

The argument, as the ICC has

facilities, like the containers, and -- and the holding

themselves out as a rail carrier in their advertising.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. FREDERICK:

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Correct.
Well, unless we

5

hold, as your friends argue on the other side, that they

6

can opt out under 10709.

7

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, you would need to

8

reach the question of whether or not exempt carriage

9

under 10502 takes away the option of a 10709 contract.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And that's a

11

different question with respect to liability and claims

12

and with respect to venue.

13

MR. FREDERICK:

14

Correct.

And let me address

that, if I might.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Maybe now you could

respond to my question about the distinction under 10502

Yes.

The STB, in an

authoritative determination that is entitled to our

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

deference, has said that when it issues an exemption for

2

certain categories of rail carriage, which it has done

3

with the multimodal shipments, those exemptions remove

4

the possibility of a 10709 contract carriage.

5

And the reason for that is that, in both

6

situations, the rail carrier has to provide an

7

opportunity for Carmack-compliant terms to be given to

8

the shipper.

9

10502(e) says that the carrier must provide

If it's exempt cargo carriage under 10502,

10

Carmack-compliant terms in order to take advantage of

11

the exemption and contract under the exemption.

12

provides contract carriage, but only if the rail carrier

13

provides common carrier tariffs that a cargo interest

14

could ship under.

15

10709

Here, because the transportation is exempt

16

under 105 -- 10205, there is no common carrier tariff

17

that is applicable.

18

there’s no common carrier tariff applicable under

11101, then there cannot be an opportunity for contract

20

carriage.

MR. BALLENGER:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Even Respondents can't really bring

themselves to say that Union Pacific is the receiving

No one is

That is how the statute always worked from 1906

to 1978.

If the receiving carrier was not governed by Carmack,

23

for Canada and Mexico, then Carmack did not apply to

anyone.

to solve.

It would read Carmack

The point of Carmack and of through bills

5
6

under Carmack and COGSA is uniformity of responsibility

7

under consistent terms for the whole voyage in one

8

person.
And the reason is that in order to recover

9
10

from anyone, the shipper has to prove receipt of the

11

goods in good condition by that carrier, and if you

12

break the chain of the through bill, then you would have

13

to prove -- the shippers would have to prove that Union

14

Pacific, for instance, received the property in good

15

order, when as Respondents concede, all that Union

16

Pacific gets is a sealed container.

19

position at the end of the day; it opens the container,

20

there's damage; no one knows where it occurs; and there’s

21

-- there’s no source of law, no source of fact to

22

figure out where the damage occurred.

Respondents raise a lot of questions about

far too late.

This case was decided on a rule 12(b)(3)

8

courts have made clear, sensibly, that if you are

confronted with a forum selection motion to dismiss, you

10

are required to at least come forward with any factual

11

disputes that you think need to be resolved before the

12

district court can grant or deny that motion.

18

transportation “shall issue a receipt” for property it

carrier under the definition.

The definitions of “railroad”
