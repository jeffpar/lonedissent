CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

Beard v. Kindler.

Mr. Eisenberg.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD EISENBERG

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. EISENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Joseph Kindler, after attacking the judicial

12

process by murdering a witness against him, again

13

repudiated that process by breaking out of prison twice

14

and fleeing the country.

15

The court of appeals refused to honor the

16

resulting procedural default on the ground that it was

17

inadequate because discretionary.

18

clarify that the purpose of the adequate State grounds

19

doctrine isn't to strip State courts of their equitable

20

power to excuse procedural defaults, but simply to

21

ensure that they don't discriminate against Federal

22

claims under the guise of procedural ruling.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

This Court should

I didn't understand the

24

Third Circuit rule to equate discretion with inadequacy.

25

I thought their position was -- the assertion was that
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the rule was mandatory; that is, if you are fugitives,

2

you are out forever.

3

But in fact, at the time that Kindler fled,

4

the rule was discretionary, so the mandatory rule hadn't

5

been firmly established.

6

Third Circuit held.

7

inadequacy.

8
9

That's what I thought the

It did not equate discretion with

MR. EISENBERG:

That was the -- the argument

presented, but I think what the Third Circuit held was

10

simply to equate discretion with inadequacy.

11

case, Justice Ginsburg -

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Where is that?

13

do we have to guess about it?

14

find that in its opinion?

15

same -- the same problem.

16

But in any

I mean, why

Where -- where do you

Because I have -- I have the

MR. EISENBERG:

I don't think we really have

17

to guess, Your Honor.

18

the third appendix at the top of page 22, where the

19

Third Circuit is characterizing its prior law in this

20

question:

21

I think, looking, for example, in

"After surveying decisions of the

22

Pennsylvania courts, we concluded that the Pennsylvania

23

courts had discretion to hear an appeal filed by a

24

fugitive who had been returned to custody before an

25

appeal was initiated and dismissed.
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Accordingly, the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

fugitive-forfeiture rule was not firmly established and,

2

therefore, is not an independent and adequate procedural

3

rule."

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the fugitive

5

forfeiture rule that they were talking about was the -

6

the mandatory rule wasn't firmly established.

7

MR. EISENBERG:

Well, I don't think that's a

8

fair reading of this language, in and of itself, Your

9

Honor.

But it really doesn't matter for our position,

10

and that's because the rule that was applied to this

11

defendant was a discretionary rule.

12

The Pennsylvania -- the trial court in this

13

case exercised his discretion not to reinstate

14

post-verdict motions.

15

the trial court and is in the joint appendix at page --

16

I believe it's 69, Your Honor -- states that the

17

question was whether the trial judge abused his

18

discretion in declining to reinstate post-trial motions.

19

When the case that Your Honor's -

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The opinion that was written by

I -- I have a number of

21

problems with the Third Circuit's opinion, but the

22

question presented, it seems to me, is not really the

23

dispositive point of the opinion.

24

question you presented is really that squarely before

25

us.

I don't think the

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. EISENBERG:

Well, Your Honor -

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I don't see a split,

3

either.

I mean, of course, there is going to be some

4

discretion.

5

read the opinion, was concerned that it wasn't firmly

6

established at the time of the waiver.

7

The question is -- the Third Circuit, as I

I have real problems with whether the waiver

8

should even be -- whether the time of the waiver is

9

controlling, but that is not the question you asked us

10
11

to resolve.
MR. EISENBERG:

Your Honor, I think the

12

problem here and the reason that we are at this point is

13

that, whether the test is stated directly as being a per

14

se ban on discretion or whether simply the standard is

15

so high under an interpretation of "firmly established"

16

that allows for virtually no deviation in results by the

17

State courts, the effect is the same.

18

the exercise of discretion by the State courts.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's to drive out

But this wasn't the

20

ruling by the court in analyzing your cases and

21

saying -- you know, in six out of the cases -- six out

22

of the ten cases, discretion was exercised, in four it

23

wasn't, and so it's not firmly established because the

24

numbers are skewed.

25

Justice Ginsburg -- you pointed Justice
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Ginsburg to page 23, and the Court very directly there

2

says, look, we are rejecting the State's argument that

3

the waiver rule was mandatory.

4

MR. EISENBERG:

Justice Sotomayor -

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so it characterized

6

your argument that way, that you were saying the

7

district court had no discretion.

8
9
10
11

MR. EISENBERG:

Justice Sotomayor, the State

didn't argue in Federal court that the State rule was
mandatory.

We were very explicit.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, whether you think

12

you did or didn't, that's how the court described it, so

13

it understood you to be taking a different position.

14
15
16

Are we going to correct it because it
misunderstood you?

Or -

MR. EISENBERG:

The problem is that the

17

Third Circuit did not engage in any inquiry about the

18

nature of the rule that was applied to this defendant,

19

so it was not in any position to say that a different

20

rule was applied to this defendant than the rule that

21

should have been applied.

22

That's the problem with the argument that a

23

new rule was sprung on this defendant.

24

was applied to this defendant was discretion, and the

25

Third Circuit never discusses anything other than that.
7
Alderson Reporting Company

The rule that

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

They reject our argument that the underlying

2

rule was mandatory in that language, but they never

3

discuss what rule was actually applied to this

4

defendant.

5

rule.

6

We think it was clearly a discretionary

But the -- the real question is whether, at

7

the time of the default, the default that occurred by

8

the extraordinary act of escaping, the defendant was not

9

fairly apprised of the consequences of his action.

10

And, really, whether or not the rule -

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You mean that the

12

defendant might not have escaped if he knew that the

13

rule wasn't -

14

MR. EISENBERG:

Well, I think that's the

15

irony of applying this sort of adequacy analysis to this

16

kind of default, but that, I think, is more of a problem

17

for Kindler than for the Commonwealth.

18

This Court has consistently held in its

19

adequacy cases that the litigant must have ample

20

opportunity to comply with the State's procedure.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I don't know why you

22

submit -- why you seem to concede that that applies

23

here.

24

of the waiver if it's an attorney arguing about jury

25

instructions and so forth, but the man escapes when the

I can understand why we want to look at the time

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

door is open or when the window is open, and he doesn't

2

give consideration to these things; and if he does, I

3

think that's quite irrelevant.

4

It seems to me that the waiver point is -

5

is something that shouldn't be conceded.

6

if ten years elapse between the time of the escape and

7

the time the State formulates its rules, that he is

8

bound by those rules when he gets there.

9

argue that.

10

I think that

But you don't

That's not what you presented to us.
MR. EISENBERG:

Well, I think, Your Honor,

11

what we are presenting is that the nature of the State

12

rule here was -- was such that the defendant had

13

reasonable notice of what he was facing by escaping,

14

whether or not it would have affected his subjective

15

decision to escape, and therefore that the State ground

16

can't be thrown out in Federal court on the ground of

17

adequacy.

18

mandatory in 1984 or discretionary doesn't much matter

19

for purposes of putting the defendant on notice that if

20

he escaped, he was going to run into serious trouble

21

trying to appeal at the same time that he was trying to

22

stay in Canada for the rest of his life.

And really, whether the rule was strictly

23

That's what this case is really all about.

24

And yet, the lower courts I think have so misconstrued

25

this Court's adequacy doctrine that they have come to
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the point of saying that even in that situation, the

2

rule is inadequate and can be ignored in Federal court.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What court has said?

As

4

I read the Third Circuit, it says:

5

that is consistently applied in the vast majority of

6

cases; even if State courts are willing to occasionally

7

overlook it and review the merits of a claim, that

8

that's okay.

9
10

MR. EISENBERG:

A procedural rule

Your Honor -

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what other circuit

11

has said that any measure of discretion or even a lot of

12

use of discretion bars deference to the State rule?

13

MR. EISENBERG:

Justice Sotomayor, I think

14

if you look at the amicus brief filed on behalf of 25

15

States, you will see that that there are a great many

16

cases where that's exactly the analysis that the courts

17

have applied, and in many of those cases they have

18

required the parties to place before them dozens and

19

sometimes hundreds of other examples of the operation of

20

a State procedural rule so that the lower Federal court

21

can decide whether that -

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How many of those cases

resulted in the overturning or the grant of habeas MR. EISENBERG:

I think in California, for

example, it's been quite common.

The State's rule for

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

timeliness of post-conviction communications is seldom

2

enforced in Federal court, as we learned from the amicus

3

brief.

4

in those cases where the courts -

In fact, it virtually doesn't exist.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And even

But do we -- what -

6

what does that tell us about us establishing the rule

7

that you propose?

8
9

MR. EISENBERG:

I think what it tells us is

that the lower courts are applying a very different

10

adequacy rule than this Court has been applying.

11

not really asking for some kind of new rule from this

12

Court as compared to your prior line of cases on

13

adequacy.

14
15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We are

But you are asking us to

take away a part of the inquiry.

16

MR. EISENBERG:

Not at all, Your Honor.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Your notice -- your

18

notice and an opportunity to comply doesn't address a

19

repeated statement by us, which is that whatever test is

20

applied has to get to whether the State court is

21

attempting to evade Federal review of constitutional

22

questions.

23

MR. EISENBERG:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

Yes, it does, Your Honor.
All right.

And so your

test does nothing to inform that question, for example,
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the Flowers situation.

2

was more than an adequate opportunity to comply, and yet

3

we said it didn't qualify for deference because it was

4

clearly, given the circumstances of the State

5

application of the rule at issue, an attempt to evade a

6

constitutional right.

7

There was a clear rule, there

MR. EISENBERG:

The question is what those

8

circumstances are, Your Honor.

And in virtually case

9

after case, the circumstances that have been identified

10

by this Court for actually finding a rule inadequate are

11

that the State rule was some kind of bait and switch,

12

that it was a -- to use Justice Holmes' classic

13

formulation, that it was a spring -- a trap that was

14

sprung on the defendant.

15

that the litigant was proceeding, another rule was

16

applied when the case reached appeal.

17

characteristically what has made this Court, not the

18

lower Federal courts, but this Court, hold that rules

19

were actually inadequate.

20

One rule existed at the time

And that is

So in Ford v. Georgia, for example, where

21

the defendant raised a Batson claim after the jury was

22

sworn, because that's what the law was at the time of

23

his trial, when the case reached appeal the appellate -

24

the State appellate court said:

25

rule now; you have to do it before the jury is sworn.

No, no; we have a new

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And they found his claim waived.

2

inadequate.

3

That rule was

In James v. Kentucky, where the defendant

4

asked for an adverse inference charge and he asked for

5

an admonition rather than an instruction, and the State

6

court said, no, no, it was supposed to be an instruction

7

rather than an admonition, that was a reversal of prior

8

State law.

9

There are many cases very much like that

10

where there is a spring set by the State in the sense

11

that a different rule is applied on appeal than was

12

before the litigant at the time that he was trying to

13

comply with the rule.

14

Now, this case obviously is quite far from

15

that, and that's exactly why this case should have been

16

the last sort of case where a rule was found inadequate.

17

The higher the standard that the lower courts apply, the

18

stricter the standard that the lower Federal courts

19

apply to analyze the adequacy of State rules, the less

20

opportunity there will be for discretion on the part of

21

the States.

22

might not be this defendant, will be the vast majority

23

of defendants who would have been more entitled, more

24

deserving of discretion, of leniency from the State

25

courts.

And the loser in that equation, while it

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

The State courts need to be allowed to apply

2

the kind of discretion in their procedural rulings that

3

this Court applies, that the Federal courts are allowed

4

in -- in Federal procedural rulings -- for example,

5

under the plain error rule, even under the Federal

6

fugitive-forfeiture rule.

7

In 1876 this Court said that it's within our

8

discretion to dismiss a case where the defendant is a

9

fugitive, and since then, while there have been a number

10

of decisions from this Court concerning fugitive

11

defendants, none of them have laid out the sort of menu,

12

the sort of standards and substandards and subrules that

13

the defendant is now arguing have to be present in a

14

rule for it to be adequate.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the question that you

16

present -- I mean, you state it forthrightly in your

17

brief, and I'm reading from page 7, you say:

18

of appeals interpreted this Court's precedent to compel

19

a finding of inadequacy for any State procedural rule

20

that permits the State courts to exercise a degree of

21

discretion.

22

you say the court of appeals interpreted this Court's

23

precedent to say:

24
25

Any discretion is inadequate."

"The court

That's what

Discretion, inadequate.

Well, I'm looking first at the petition
appendix page 62, which describes the district court's
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

understanding, which the Third Circuit affirmed.

It

2

says:

3

excusing or disregarding a State procedural rule does

4

not render the rule inadequate to procedurally bar

5

advancing a habeas claim in district court."

"An occasional act of grace by a State court in

6

Well, that's saying, yes, you can have a

7

rule with discretion, not to follow the rule woodenly,

8

and that doesn't make it inadequate.

9

MR. EISENBERG:

Justice Ginsburg, an

10

occasional act of grace, that level of -- of leniency or

11

flexibility that would be allowed by the district

12

court's view of the law, or the Third Circuit's, is

13

simply not appropriate in judging the adequacy of State

14

grounds.

15

It's certainly not the kind of miserly,

16

crabbed review of the exercise of discretion that occurs

17

in Federal procedural rulings like the plain error rule.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, do you want to

19

modify then what you said?

20

appeals said that any -- any degree of discretion means

21

that the rule is inadequate.

22

MR. EISENBERG:

You said that the court of

Justice Ginsburg, we say

23

that because there was no analysis here of what degree

24

of discretion or whether discretion was actually applied

25

by the State court in this case.

That's why, in effect,

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

we say that the Third Circuit's ruling was about the per

2

se exercise of discretion.

3

But even if it wasn't automatically about

4

the exercise of discretion, even if it was merely

5

applying a rule which is so narrow and strict that in

6

practical effect the State courts have little actual

7

discretion to exercise, that's still a problem and it's

8

still inconsistent with the purpose of the adequate

9

State grounds doctrine, which was never intended to

10

allow Federal courts or to require lower Federal courts

11

to engage in the kind of analysis that many of the lower

12

Federal courts are now undertaking.

13

Basically, they -- they are taking out their

14

magnifying glasses and starting to split hairs by

15

looking at every single case, by looking at how those

16

cases compare to each other, by deciding whether there's

17

enough of a standard, is there enough of a precedent,

18

did you tell this little particular little fact to the

19

defendant before.

20

this Court's adequacy doctrine.

21

That sort of analysis is not part of

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But what makes -- makes

22

this particularly puzzling is you are attributing a rule

23

to the Third Circuit that that very circuit in Campbell

24

v. Burris said was not a tool.

25

Burris, the Third Circuit said a State procedural rule

In the -- in Campbell v.

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

can't be, cannot be rendered per se inadequate merely

2

because it allows for some exercise of discretion.

3

MR. EISENBERG:

And I think if the Third

4

Circuit had applied that statement in this case, there

5

might have been a different result and at the very least

6

there would have been additional analysis, because that

7

calls for additional analysis beyond the absolute lack

8

of analysis in this opinion about the nature of the rule

9

that was actually applied to this defendant.

10

Without that sort of analysis, you can't say

11

that the Court is looking at whether this -- this

12

particular exercise of discretion came within the small

13

window that that court would allow to the States.

14

-- that -

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That

Well, it would be really

16

odd, considering that one member of the panel was on

17

both cases, Stapleton, and these cases are in the same

18

year, for at least that judge not to think that what he

19

said in the one case was in no conflict with what he

20

said in the other.

21

MR. EISENBERG:

And yet we have a result,

22

Your Honor, which is explainable only on the ground that

23

the State court rule maintains some power of discretion

24

by the State courts.

25

opinion that explains the result in this case.

There is nothing else in the

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

But I emphasize again that, even if the

2

court had applied a different rule, the rule that it

3

said it was applying in some of the Third Circuit's

4

other panel opinions, we would still be left with a

5

standard which is far narrower than anything that this

6

Court has actually applied in its own decisions.

7

There have been a variety of phrases in the

8

Court's decisions, things like "firmly established,"

9

"strictly followed," "regularly applied."

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But it seems to me that

11

that's not what the Third -- Third Circuit was saying.

12

It was saying that adequacy of the rule is determined by

13

the law in effect at the time of the waiver, and it

14

wasn't well-established.

15

Now, I have real problems with that as an

16

opening premise, but that's not what you asked us to

17

resolve in your petition.

18

MR. EISENBERG:

Well, I don't think that

19

there is an analysis of whether the law was -- was

20

established at the time of the waiver, Your Honor,

21

because what the court says, or at least what the

22

precedents it rely on say, is that at the time of the

23

waiver here, assuming for the moment that that's the

24

relevant inquiry, the rule was discretionary.

25

The question then has to be, was that rule
18
Alderson Reporting Company

applied to the defendant?

2

applied to the defendant, if the difference -

3

If a different rule is

how you say that.

the district court had discretion -- none of the

13

I understood the Third Circuit to be saying

14

that it was those two latter components, which the

15

courts below themselves identified as new questions,

16

that it was resolving, that involve new rules.

17

MR. EISENBERG:

Your Honor -

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's as simply as I

19

thought the issue was.

20

dissuade me and concede your point that what the court

21

was saying, the discretionary application, is what was

22

That is a distinction that Doctor invented from

disagreeing with is the Third Circuit's conclusion of

what the status of Pennsylvania law was?

9

MR. EISENBERG:

Well, that would have been

10

clearer, I think, if we were appealing from the Doctor

11

decision here now rather than from this decision, but I

12

think that there is at the very least a great degree of

13

unclarity in exactly what the -

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, Doctor dealt with

what will the court do with respect to, not post-verdict

to do with post-verdict motions to reinstate and to

MR. EISENBERG:

In fact, not a new question

That's where the

MR. EISENBERG:

I think that's at least

where the disagreement lie -- lay between the

Commonwealth and Kindler below.

14

there's a great -

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

As I say, I think

All right.

Let's assume

16

the Third Circuit, that we take the hypothetical that

17

they were right.

18

How do you still win?

MR. EISENBERG:

Then the question becomes,

19

Your Honor, whether the alleged discrepancy, difference

20

in the State law or -- or degree of unclarity is

21

sufficient to meet this Court's adequacy test.

22

And that's where I think we get back to

23

Federal analogies like the Federal fugitive flight rule.

And I'd like to address that -- that question, and then

Under the Federal fugitive flight rule, many

2

of these kinds of distinctions have never been spelled

3

out.

4

in the late 1800s that it was within our discretion to

5

dismiss.

The courts simply laid out a general rule starting

6

But despite the fact that the Court hasn't

7

basically subdivided the rule with the nit-picking

8

analysis that the Doctor court tried to impose on the

9

Pennsylvania cases, that doesn't make the fugitive

10

forfeiture rule inadequate and therefore inapplicable to

11

defendants.

12

in Ortega-Rodriguez, which overturned an automatic

13

forfeiture rule on -- applied by the Federal Court of

14

Appeals, the Court allowed the district court's

15

discretion to carry out the fugitive-forfeiture rule as

16

they saw fit under the circumstances.

17

Ortega-Rodriguez, despite the fact that no substandards

18

had yet been developed, there was still a Federal

19

fugitive-forfeiture rule -

that that's an excellent example of what I was just

2

saying.

3

forfeiture hadn't yet addressed the subquestion of

4

whether there should be an exception for capital

5

defendants did not render the State rule inadequate.

6

The fact that the general rule of fugitive

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But wasn't there -- wasn't

7

there a general rule that capital defendants always get

8

one shot at their constitutional issues?

9

MR. EISENBERG:

No, Your Honor.

At this

10

time, there was simply a rule that said that in capital

11

cases we will apply a limited form of relaxation of

12

our -- of our rules to address significant questions.

13

When you look at that language, it's almost exactly the

14

same as the Federal plain error rule.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But were there

16

Pennsylvania cases in which they had prevented a capital

17

defendant from raising a Federal constitutional issue

18

for the first time?

19

MR. EISENBERG:

No, Your Honor.

There had

20

only been a few capital cases even decided at the time

21

of the flight here.

22

The point is that the way that the -

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

How about other rules?

So then how can you have a

firmly established rule?
MR. EISENBERG:

I don't think you have a

7

firmly established rule, Your Honor, because you have -

8

the firmly established rule was the preexisting rule

9

requiring preservation of error claims, in the same way

10

that under the Federal plain error rule the rule is you

11

have to preserve your claims.

12

A defendant cannot come along and say:

Hey,

13

in Rule 52(b) it says that if my claim is plain and

14

significant it's not waived, and therefore I have no

15

obligation to ever preserve my claims.

17

you, but it doesn't do away with the underlying rule of

issue preservation.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. LAWRY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

I first want to address what is really at

2

stake here.

3

the adequate State ground doctrine so that Mr. Kindler

4

may be executed with no review by any court of his

5

meritorious claims that his death sentence was

6

unconstitutional.

7

The Commonwealth wants this Court to change

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but that's

8

because he escaped.

He avoided judicial process, and

9

you would have him be in the same position once he's

10

captured and returned and captured and returned as he

11

was before he escaped at all, right?

12

MR. LAWRY:

Well, the question is, was there

13

a firmly established and consistently applied State rule

14

that would result in all of his claims being taken away.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And you think

16

that -- and you don't think -- you think you can argue

17

that a State rule saying, look, if you escape and flee

18

the jurisdiction, you bar -- your claims cannot be

19

adequate and independent?

20

MR. LAWRY:

No, I don't think that, Your

21

Honor.

What -- what -- what this Court has always

22

required and what we are arguing, this Court has always

23

required that a State procedural rule be firmly

24

established and consistently applied in order to take

25

away a litigant's claims.
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And our position and what the Third Circuit

2

below held was that in numerous respects, the -- the

3

rules that the State court applied here were not firmly

4

established or consistently applied.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

MR. LAWRY:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What rules -- I'm -

Well, it's really What is -- what is your

8

position as to what the Third Circuit was saying or

9

holding?

Are you saying, like your adversary, that they

10

were saying because it was discretionary and there were

11

a lot of exceptions to it, it wasn't firmly established?

12

Or were you -- or do you read it as saying, now that you

13

have made it mandatory, that's a new rule -- the waiver

14

mandatory, that's a new rule?

15
16

MR. LAWRY:

what we're saying is that -

17
18

Well -- well, to begin with,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
saying.

It's not what you are

What do you think the Third Circuit said?

19

MR. LAWRY:

What -- what I would suggest the

20

Third Circuit said is that this case is very like

21

Doctor.

22

Doctor involved a defendant who fled pretrial or in the

23

middle of trial, and at that time there was a sort of

24

two-part rule in Pennsylvania for dealing with fugitive

25

forfeiture.

It said Doctor was controlling precedent, and

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

One part was -- and this is in noncapital

2

cases.

One part was if the defendant flees during the

3

appellate process, then the appeal could be dismissed.

4

The other part was if it's any time before that, there

5

is discretion.

6

And -- and so, when Doctor appealed, by the

7

time his appeal was heard, Pennsylvania had changed its

8

rule completely to one in which a flight at any time, at

9

any time at all, was considered a complete forfeiture.

10

And that was -- it was that change from a discretionary

11

rule to a forfeiture rule that the Third Circuit said in

12

Doctor was inadequate.

13

that the same kind of change was inadequate.

And it said again in Kindler

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

MR. LAWRY:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

Third Circuit was identifying?

18

MR. LAWRY:

What was the change -

The change -- that you think the

The change that the Third

19

Circuit identified was from a -- a situation where there

20

was complete discretion -- and really more often than

21

not, even in noncapital cases, the discretion was

22

exercised to hear the issues.

23

one where there is essentially a -- a presumption of -

24

of waiver or forfeiture and some potential way to -

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It changed from that to

Let's assume that a

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

lower court in this case had said:

2

discretion, but we're not going to exercise it because

3

you escaped twice and were away much longer than most

4

fugitives.

5

memories fade, that it's harder for trials that are so

6

distant from the event, that distant from an event.

7

8

You know, we have

There is a presumption that witnesses'

We

Is it your view -- because that's the

9

undertone I'm hearing -- that under firmly established

10

ground that the court would have still ruled that that

11

exercise of discretion was not adequate under -

12
13

MR. LAWRY:

That the Third Circuit would

have said that?

Yeah.

It's a very -- it's a very

I think if -

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Sure, it is.

But what

18

you -- there is a tone to the way you presented this

19

case that says because they chose often to exercise

20

discretion in the past, if they choose not to in any

21

case, it's no longer an independent State ground.

22

That's what -- is that the point you are arguing?

23

MR. LAWRY:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

No.
Because that's the

question presented.

6

more differences in it.

8

exercised discretion sometimes but not others it's still

9

an independent State ground to find forfeiture?

10

MR. LAWRY:

At what point does a lower

There -- there are several

11

things that are important in this kind of situation.

12

One is how -- it's really how is the rule being applied.

13

And if -- if the rule is -- if there is a situation

14

where -- where in the vast majority of cases the rule is

15

being applied to deny review and there are occasional

16

acts of grace, that's one thing.

17

when almost every time the situation comes up review is

18

allowed and then in the occasional exception, without

19

explanation, it's taken away.

20

It's very different

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, following

21

up on that, I'd like your answer to this question:

22

State procedural rule automatically inadequate and,

23

therefore, unenforceable when the State rule is

They say no, you say no.

that the Third Circuit said CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And yet we

nonetheless granted -- granted cert.

17

MR. LAWRY:

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, if some of

19

us -- or I suppose if several of us -- think that that

20

may have been or was what the Third Circuit said, would

21

you have any objection to us vacating the opinion,

22

explaining since you both agree that the rule is not

automatically inadequate, make sure they understand

that, and then they can proceed however they see fit?

MR. LAWRY:

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Insofar as the ongoing

3

rule is concerned, let's assume that as of the time of

4

Doctor, which was a Third Circuit case, 1996, the

5

Pennsylvania rule was then clear, Pennsylvania for the

6

first time having made its rule clear.

7

improper to apply it to this defendant, because he

14

It -- it doesn't affect rational

It doesn't trap an attorney.

MR. LAWRY:

Why can't we

is that -- that Pennsylvania law and what the

There was the -- the discretionary sort of

Then there was a time period when there
Then there was another time

And so that -- that kind of shifting, of

23

turning procedural rules on and off, is the antithesis

24

of consistent application of rules.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that may be, but

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

where -- where do you get that from the opinion of the

2

court of appeals here?

3

the opinion of the court of appeals the proposition that

4

if there is discretion, it's not a firmly established

5

rule.

6

I find it very easy to get from

Where do you get your theory, that they had

7

changed it from a discretionary rule to a mandatory rule

8

at the time that the State court made this ruling?

9

Where do you find that in the opinion of the court of

10

appeals?

11

MR. LAWRY:

Well, I -- I would -- I would

12

acknowledge that it's a bit cryptic, but I think because

13

the Third Circuit in Kindler said that Doctor is what's

14

controlling in its analysis, I think you really have to

15

read it in light of Doctor.

16

that what the Third Circuit was looking at there was a

17

change from a discretionary rule to a mandatory rule.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

And Doctor makes very clear

So they are going to say, I

19

imagine below -- I'm not sure -- say:

20

right, and Doctor talked about the shift from mandatory

21

to discretionary, and the district court -- the State,

22

in Doctor, said that it was a mandatory -- it's

23

mandatory.

24
25

Look, that's

But in this case, the district court said
it's discretionary.

So insofar as there are two rules
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

-- or were at the time, your client got the benefit of

2

the most liberal, and, therefore, insofar as there is a

3

difference, it made no difference.

4

MR. LAWRY:

Well, actually our client didn't

5

get the benefit of a number of things that were clearly

6

established law in Pennsylvania at the time.

7

First off, there was the policy of relaxed

8

waiver that applied to all capital cases and meant

9

merits review of all issues.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And Well, that's -- that's a

11

different issue.

12

what the court of appeals was based on -- decision

13

was -- was not this that you are arguing now, but

14

rather, it was based on the fact that there had been a

15

change in the law from discretionary to mandatory.

16

Now, your -- your assertion is that

I can't find that, frankly, in the opinion,

17

except in its reference to Doctor, so I have got to go

18

back and read Doctor and guess that that's what they

19

meant when they referred to Doctor.

20

But assuming it's true, Justice Breyer says,

21

even if it is true, what difference does it make?

22

Because, even if they had changed from a discretionary

23

to a mandatory, the trial court in the State had not

24

realized that they had changed and gave him the

25

discretionary.
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

So what -- what complaint do you have?

2

MR. LAWRY:

Well, it's not even clear,

3

really, what -- what the trial court was applying, but I

4

think that there are -- there are a number of serious

5

problems with -- with the consistent application in this

6

case.

7

If you want to look for just the most

8

obvious ones, Reginald Lewis, a capital defendant, and

9

Mr. Kindler escaped together, at the same time, the same

10

day, together.

11

merits review, of all of his issues on direct appeal,

12

all of his issues in post-conviction.

13

no review.

14

Mr. Lewis got complete full review,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Kindler got

Right.

And that

15

is -- your objection is that it wasn't fairly applied.

16

Discretion was abused in this case, to borrow from the

17

Federal law.

18

should have treated them the same.

19

They didn't treat them the same.

They

But the question is whether the rule is

20

automatically inadequate if there is discretion.

21

are arguing about how it was applied, which I guess

22

means that it's not automatically inadequate because if

23

they apply it the way you think it should be then it

24

would be adequate.

are arguing about the application -- the exercise of

rule; and that's unfair, right?

You say the one guy, Lewis, got the benefit

MR. LAWRY:

12

That's -- that's part of what

Mr. Kindler asked for relaxed -- in fact,

when the Commonwealth initially moved to dismiss his

post-verdict motions, the Commonwealth said:

there is this relaxed waiver out there, so if you -- if

2

you don't dismiss his post-verdict motions entirely, at

least dismiss the guilt phase and consider his issues

4

with regard to capital sentencing.

5

said that.

6

The Commonwealth

So -- so the -- so there's -- there's no

7

question that -- that, on the PCRA appeal, what the

8

Pennsylvania Supreme Court applied was a mandatory rule.

9

They said it's forfeited, no review whatsoever, and -

10

and that would be the difference -

by us, is that what you're -

MR. LAWRY:

Yes, yes.

JUSTICE BREYER:

How would you fill in this

sentence?

I'm beginning where the Chief Justice did.

Say everybody said:

18

existence of discretion does not make a State ground

19

inadequate, so we send it back for you now.

20

will have some good arguments, I guarantee each side

will have some good arguments, as to whether they were

MR. LAWRY:

JUSTICE BREYER:

And you

Right.
Now, next sentence, which

Alderson Reporting Company

1

maybe would never be written:

2

discretion automatically means it's adequate, for it

3

could be applied inconsistently.

4

This is not to say that

Now, there could be another sentence,

5

because that other sentence would have to go on to the

6

fact that any discretionary rule will never be applied

7

with perfect consistency or anywhere near it.

8

would be true if you give a trial judge the choice in

9

his discretion to waive a -- a time limit ruling.

10

Some will do it with one.

Some will do it

2

supervising lots of trial courts, and you will have

3

different human beings sitting there as judges, and they

will inevitably be inconsistent with each other to some

5

degree.

Have you not noticed that?

6

MR. LAWRY:

7

(Laughter.)

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

Certainly.

So is there anything we can

say that will improve the situation?

That's why I

10

started out by saying maybe the best thing is to say

11

nothing.

12

MR. LAWRY:

Well, the -- the key is really

13

consistent application and -- and looking to see whether

14

the rules are being turned off and on.

15

Like I would -- I would point the Court to

16

Barr v. City of Columbia, which I think is a very good

17

example, where there is maybe five people who make the

18

same objection, and four of them get merits review, and

19

the other person doesn't get merits review.

20

there's some explanation somewhere for that, but this

So it seems to me that the fact that it's a

is still an adequate ground.

MR. LAWRY:

would argue that there -- there is every reason to see a

potential for the State seeking to avoid Federal review.

look at what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court actually

said here, they said Mr. Kindler's case is in the

category like people who affirmatively waive.

that's what they said on direct appeal.

it would be an independent and adequate State rule to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There is a certain irony

12

that the case you're relying on on the merits is Mills,

13

where if he hadn't escaped he would have gone through

14

the whole process before Mills was decided.

15

MR. LAWRY:

Well, but he may well have

16

gotten relief anyway.

He raised -- he actually raised

17

an objection, a Mills-type objection at trial.

18

raised in the post-verdict motions.

It would presumably

19

have been raised on direct appeal.

And -- and if it had

20

been so raised on direct appeal he could have -- and he

21

didn't win on direct appeal, he could have sought

22

post-conviction relief in Pennsylvania based on the fact

23

that Mills came down later, because the Pennsylvania

24

retroactivity rule is that you can get retroactive

25

application of a decision if you -- if you objected.

It was

If

Why do you pick 1984 as the

time of the escape?

Whether it's an adequate or

independent State ground, whether it's been consistently

applied, it seemed to me -- it seems to me you should

look to the time at which the State rule is applied.

18

Now, as of 1984 I suppose there are some

19

notice requirements that you can say due process

20

requires, but I don't know why the adequacy of the State

21

ground, whether it's consistently applied, should be

22

judged on the basis of what was the law in 1984, rather

23

than what was the State law at the time they applied the

rule.
