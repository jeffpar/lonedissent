ORAL ARGUMENT OF MADELEINE C. WANSLEE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MS. WANSLEE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Congress has precisely delineated three

12

types of debt in bankruptcy:

13

dischargeable, those that are dischargeable unless the

14

creditor timely objects, and those debts that are simply

15

not dischargeable.

16

of this third category.

17

is self-executing unless a debtor proves that

18

repayment will cause an undue hardship on the debtor and

19

the debtor's dependents.

20

Bankruptcy Code section 523 to reduce those three types

21

of debt down to two.

22

their student loan debts by mere declaration opens the

23

door to recategorizing every category of

24

non-dischargeable debt, and that includes --

Circuit that bankruptcy judges should not say, now, I am

18

Ninth Circuit said that bankruptcy courts have no

19

business involving themselves in this dispute if the

20

creditor fails to object.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

1
2

we started by saying was vague.
So I asked you for your strongest case.

You

3

said Vallely.

4

it's only four pages.

5

is that there is a statute which says there is

6

bankruptcy jurisdiction over all commercial businesses

7

except for insurance companies and two other categories.

8

This party here is an insurance company, and

9
10
11

I have only looked at it quickly, but
And what that case seems to say

and therefore they can attack it later, because there
was no jurisdiction over an insurance company.
Now, if that's your strongest case, I don't

12

know what the others are going to say, but it seems to

13

me you don't have much precedental support to put this

14

in a category of lacking jurisdiction.

15

MS. WANSLEE:

Your Honor, we are talking

16

about a statutory right here, and the fact that Congress

17

has specifically provided that certain categories of

18

debts, for very important public policy reasons, are

19

carved out from discharge.

20

because it violates the plain language of the statute.

21

Again, even if it's provided for by the plan, the

22

discharge this debtor got under 1328 --

23

And the reason it's void is

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But why -- why should it be

24

void, looking at 1327?

We have a confirmed plan.

25

- you have -- 1328 does include -- except 523(a), as you
16
Alderson Reporting Company

You ­

Official

pointed out.

But 1327 says "Effect of

2

confirmation," and that says, "The provisions of a

3

confirmed plan" -- the provision here is you get 13,000,

4

not 17,000 -- "bind the debtor and each creditor,

5

whether or not the claim of such creditor is provided

6

for by the plan" -- which it wasn't in full here -- "and

7

whether or not such creditor has objected to or has

8

accepted or rejected the plan."

9

That seems to say at the end of the line,

10

you get that final determination confirmed, that's it.

11

That's as final as you come and whatever mistakes were

12

made on the way there, you can't look behind at the

confirmation.

Two responses to that, Mr.

23

Chief Justice.

First, if we are looking just at the

24

language of 1328, which is reproduced at the page 3 of

25

the appendix to the blue brief, it states, as the Chief

Justice notes, that:

"The court shall grant the debtor

2

a discharge" of certain debts.

3

and it says "except any debt" -- now, I can see that

4

that language is subject to a degree of ambiguity.

5

I think even that language is susceptible to being read

6

as a legal limitation on the effect of the discharge

7

order that the provision has just told the court to

8

grant.

There is then a comma,

In other words, the reason that –-

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, then the key

10

distinction you draw in your brief is totally

11

meaningless.

12

is whether the provision is, quote, “framed as a

13

directive” to the bankruptcy court.

14

framed as a directive to the bankruptcy court, and

15

therefore doesn't -- isn't self-executing.

16

But

You say on page 18 that this -- the issue

MR. HEYTENS:

And here it is

Mr. Chief Justice, I think the

17

provision before the comma clearly is framed as a

18

directive to the bankruptcy court.

19

is that the language after the comma is at least capable

20

of being read consistent with --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What I’m suggesting

There are a lot of commas.

What comma are you referring to?
MR. HEYTENS:

Excuse me, Justice Scalia.

am referring to the comma in -- in 1328(a), the last comma

25

right before the (1), "except any debt."

Alderson Reporting Company

1

And the reason that we think that has to be

2

construed as a limitation on the scope of the bankruptcy

3

court's discharge order is twofold.

4

there has been no suggestion whatsoever that there is a

5

different rule for chapter 13 plans, which is covered by

6

1328, than there is for chapter 7 bankruptcies, chapter

7

11 bankruptcies, or chapter 12 bankruptcies.

consequences of saying that 1328 alone is not a

9

limitation, that is the consequence that that would

12

consequence of -- there happen to be -- well, I counted --

including criminal fines, sentences.

15

kinds of things.

16

accepting your argument that anybody who is a creditor

17

in respect to any of those 14 things can come in at any

18

time and announce under Rule 60(b)(4), even if it's 10

19

court made a mistake?

2

understand this is a limitation on the effect of the

covers it in the first place.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I think quite the --

Wait a moment.

What would it

6

be in the case where you have a discharge order and it

Now, are you saying that that

10

later, because he will say that, since it falls in that

category, the judgment is void insofar as this language

covers what I don't want it to cover?

13

MR. HEYTENS:

Well, Justice Breyer, there

14

are three very specific categories of somebodies who

15

can't do that, and Congress has specifically identified

16

those three categories.

17

In 523(c), Congress specifically identified

18

three categories of non-dischargeable debt for which the

19

onus is on the creditor to request a hearing and obtain

20

a determination by the bankruptcy court.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So -- so

2

you’re almost begging the question, because it's

3

possible to argue that if a debt is not dischargeable at

4

all under any circumstance, your argument might have

5

more legs because then the court has no jurisdiction

6

over that property.

That would certainly be the

argument that would be made in future cases, if the

Court were to accept Mr. Espinosa's argument.

clear, the consequences of accepting it and not

14

If the facts of this case were changed by the -- the

be better to get what money's available now rather than

MR. HEYTENS:

Court said, on pages 453 and 454 of Hood, the bankruptcy

8

court still cannot discharge that debt --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But the irony of your

position is it's in the creditor's interest to get what

hoping to get interest later on, and even though that's

the fact, you cannot give relief in this situation.

14

MR. HEYTENS:

Well, Justice Stevens, the

15

creditor certainly does have interests.

16

reason Congress would provide for this regime is that

17

there is an important public interest at stake here,

18

too, which is that the Department of Education is

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL J. MEEHAN

MR. MEEHAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

Last term, in Travelers, this Court held

15

that, if the plain terms of a confirmed 11 plan

16

unambiguously apply to a particular issue, they are

17

entitled to their effect.

18

That is this case, I submit.

Now, the case did go on to acknowledge that

19

there can be some situations in which the finality is

20

not going to be found -- it said subject matter per se

21

is not one of those -- but that if the court's action

22

was so plainly beyond its jurisdiction as to be a

23

manifest abuse of authority -- and this was not

24

necessary to the holding, I suppose, but it was

25

described in kind of where we would be in terms of
29

exceptions -- then perhaps finality would not apply.

to how I’m going to look on this case.
MR. MEEHAN:

I would agree that that is

14

correct, Your Honor.

15

Mr. Heytens said that there are, on average, 1,000

16

chapter 13 plans filed per bankruptcy judge every year.

17

The bankruptcy judges do and are entitled to have

18

creditors make objections.

19

Stevens was right that if a creditor and a debtor wanted

20

to come in and stipulate that there would be a discharge

21

of a portion of the student loan without a finding of

22

undue hardship, then certainly they can do so.

The reason I hesitate is this:

Indeed, I think that Justice

23

I don't --

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

Is it -- is it easy for a

bankruptcy judge to identify a particular debt as a

arrangements.

out this requirement that -- of a hardship showing?

MR. MEEHAN:

If I used the word

"obligation," perhaps I was a little imprecise.

2

put it this way:

have we ever said at any stage of this litigation, that

4

this plan complied with 523(a)(8).

5

Let me

Number one, I am not here to say, nor

That's clear.

Number two, if there had been any objection

6

raised whatsoever at any time, then it would obviously

7

have been wrong for the bankruptcy judge to confirm the

8

plan.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if there’s no

10

objection?

11

and it -- it provides for the discharge of student debt;

12

it covers student debt.

13

The bankruptcy judge sees a chapter 13 plan,

It's labeled "student debt."

Is it improper for the bankruptcy judge to

14

say you can't do this by this mechanism, you have to

15

start an adversary proceeding?

16

MR. MEEHAN:

I do not think it is improper

17

for the bankruptcy judge to act that way, because under

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. MEEHAN:

I didn't hear.

Proper --

I do not think -- I'm sorry.

I

21

do not think it would be improper.

22

24

which says that the bankruptcy court may act sua sponte

me, that it's not improper for him to do it.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I want you

Well, Justice Scalia -And you’re not willing to

6

say that.

You’re willing to say that bankruptcy courts

7

can do that if they like, but, you know, if they have a

8

kid that has a lot of bankruptcy debts, he has a soft

9

heart for student loan debts, he sees this as a student

10

loan debt, all right, let's give this kid a break.

11

he enters -- that's okay?

12

MR. MEEHAN:

And

No, I balance -- I balance your

13

question against Justice Stevens's hypothetical, and

14

only in the circumstance where it is clear either

15

through extensive notice, and I say waiver here, or

16

through an actual stipulation -- only in those

17

circumstances would it be appropriate for a bankruptcy

18

court to confirm a plan.

19

And even then, I submit, under section 105,

20

if the bankruptcy court said I will not do so, the

21

bankruptcy court need not do so, and in fact -- in fact,

22

the bankruptcy judge here, Judge Hollowell, when she

23

denied United relief under Rule 60, said that she as a

bankruptcy judge would not have done so.

despite the fact of no adversary proceeding -- you’re

6

not -- you’re not necessarily willing to say that the

7

bankruptcy court can't do that?

8

10

MR. MEEHAN:

Yes, because -- let me back up

and talk perhaps a little more generally.
I mean, in litigation in general, parties are

11

free to stipulate away or to decide not to litigate an

12

element of a claim.

13

judges would say that's fine.

14

again -- and I don't want to be too repetitious -- but

15

in this instance, the bankruptcy judge does have that

16

extra “well, no,” I read this as being something that's

17

too important for me to let the parties stipulate away.

18

That's the only reason that I don't go completely with

If they, in fact, do that, most

student debt in a chapter 13 petition?

3

I do want

This was clear notice.

Number two, I think the bankruptcy court --

4

excuse me, the Ninth Circuit was not wrong, because in

5

the Ninth Circuit, there was binding precedent, the Pardee

case.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

No, I understand that.

But in

8

the absence of circuit -- controlling circuit precedent,

is it -- can an attorney be sanctioned for attempting to

10

get the discharge of student debt through a chapter 13

petition, knowing, as I assume every bankruptcy attorney

12

knows, that that is not the proper way to attempt to get

discharge of a student debt -- student loan?

JUSTICE BREYER:

But why would it not be a

sanctionable matter under Rule 11?

If -- the lawyer

7

knows that he is supposed to make this special claim to

8

get this kind of discharge -- he knows an ordinary claim

9

won't do it.

He submits a paper that asks for the

10

ordinary discharge, but he has to sign it, and that

11

sign -- that signature, is a -- is a certification that to

12

the best of his knowledge, the claims and other legal

13

contentions are warranted by existing law.

14

So if he signs it knowing that that isn't

15

the way to do it -- indeed, there is not even an

argument for doing it that way, for modifying the law --

17

then why isn't that a sanctionable matter under Rule 11?

18
19

MR. MEEHAN:

I am not here to say absolutely

it is not, Justice Breyer.

20

What I'm saying, I think, is that some of

the bankruptcy courts in some of the circuits have said,

22

at least without invoking Rule 11, that it -- that it is

improper.

--

MR. MEEHAN:

The reason I ask that is I

think the argument on the other side is that it's so

clear in the law that this is not the way to go about it,

10

that you have to make a separate piece of paper saying

11

you have special hardship; that that’s so clear what

Congress wanted, that 40 years later you can come back

and attack it, if they didn't do it.

basically, in my mind, their argument.

But I think a simpler way would be to say if

it's that clear, if it really is that clear, the bar

itself will enforce the rule by not knowingly deviating

creditors whether or not they are listed.

speaking that is correct.

I’m just wondering,

doesn't it happen all the time that creditors are not

not discharged?

to ask you to interpret the statute, whether it's 1328

5

burden on an already overburdened system.

6

MR. MEEHAN:

And

Well, the argument that was

7

made by the Petitioner and its amici on that point, I

8

think, as -- as was pointed out in one of our amicus

9

briefs, overlooks the electronic notice, the

10

instantaneous notice, the fact that under Federal

11

regulations, which, by the way, do also require the

12

guarantee and lenders to do these things and to exercise

13

due diligence before they can get repaid --

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's -- that’s what why

15

it’s a -- this is actually -- the part that is a lack of

16

understanding or a complete understanding on my part, is

17

-- is how Rule 60(b) works, because -- because it does ­

18

- the law does have the three categories -- the three

19

categories that your friend described.

the creditor doesn't object, unless certain things are

filled out, and they weren't.

So the three are there, made an objection.

If at any point the creditor had come in and objected,

time limit on that, and the time limit is “a reasonable

13

time.”

14

to say they didn't file -- if fact they never filed

So

what is -- how is it supposed to work?
MR. MEEHAN:

Well, the crux of it is, is

21

that there are other subparts of Rule 60, of course,

22

as -- as we all know, that give broader potential relief,

23

but they have time limits on them.

24

5

only basis upon which Petitioners sought relief in the

6

bankruptcy court -- and they made that very clear in the

7

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that's not -- their

14

position is that 528(a)(8) -- or 523(a)(8) makes this --

15

it puts it outside the discharge order.

The discharge

16

order does not cover this kind of debt.

It doesn't

determination.

19

So, what they are saying is the discharge

20

discharged other things, but it could not discharge this

21

particular debt, so it's not discharged.

22

MR. MEEHAN:

To be precise, if I may,

23

1328(a) says, "The discharge shall not" and then defines

24

the categories.

25

And as Chief Justice Roberts said --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

niggling at me that I do need an answer to before you sit

5

answer the question that I asked him first.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

MR. MEEHAN:

I'm sorry.

1328 is the operative statute

8

for the discharge of a chapter 13, and it says “shall

9

discharge” except for those categories that are listed.

10

The argument has been made that there is

11

some significance to the 523, which says "does not

12

discharge."

13

that applies only to the subpart (b)’s in 1328, which is

14

discharges even if the plan has not been fully performed

by the debtor.

circumstance.

17

But as -- as the Chief Justice observed,

And the -- and this is not that

So the "does not" language is simply not

18

applicable to our case, because it is not a 1328(b)

19

discharge that we are involved with.

20

And so, Justice Ginsburg, I -- I think your

21

question, again, comes back to an argument of law, of

22

procedure that would be dealt with on any appeal or

23

perhaps on the -- on the more expansive subparts of Rule

24

60 if they had been properly brought.

25

I suppose that

8

that -- that the creditors for student loans could have

the automatic electronic thing where they say, we insist

whether or not there was a hardship hearing in the case.

But that doesn't solve the

So that -- that means they have -- they

14

have -- they have to -- they have to inquire into every

15

case whether or not the proper hearing has been made.

16

MR. MEEHAN:

Well, Justice Kennedy, they

17

have to inquire, in any event, because the Federal

18

regulations require them to, number one, determine that

19

there was a filing; and, number two, even before there is

20

an adversary proceeding, to make its own assessment, the

lender or the guarantee -- the guarantor to make its own

the situation is, to see whether there’s likely an

undue hardship.

12

They don't have to forbear from making an

13

objection to a plan unless they have a basis to

14

determine that there was undue hardship.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, if they had

16

come to the court at the time the discharge order was

17

about to be entered and said we object, there has been

18

no undue hardship found, would the court have been

19

obligated to alter the plan at that point?

21

that the discharge order was being entered, there’s an

objection.

MR. MEEHAN:

Justice Sotomayor, I think that

the result would not change, because at that point we

3

have a long final plan, and we do have -- you know, the

4

issue that is real important that we don't spend a lot

5

of time talking about because it’s sort of ingrained in us

6

is finality.

7

There are chapter 13 --

10

So that's the question.

Is it the plan that’s final or is it the

It's the plan, I submit,

12

happen.

MR. MEEHAN:

It definitely was put aside.

It was not raised.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But -- so, it might have

7

been the stronger due process argument.

But having put

8

that aside, then your belief is that there is no point

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, going back to

2

Justice Kennedy's point, I mean, some people are listed

3

in discharge orders that were never discussed in the

4

plan, or otherwise some people are excluded that should

5

have been included.

6

Those people can't appeal?

MR. MEEHAN:

Well, I am not prepared to say

7

that they cannot.

I certainly, if I were representing

8

them, would try -- try it, but it's just something that

9

I have not seen, and in working up this case, I am not

10

familiar with it, but it may very well be an appealable

11

order.

12

My point is simply that, the bottom line, we

13

have something here that is very final; there are

14

literally billions of dollars of disbursements made by

15

chapter 13 trustees in reliance on the these plans; and

16

it would be very, very upsetting to the bankruptcy

17

jurisdiction, exceedingly upsetting, to make a very broad

18

exception to finality.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MADELEINE C. WANSLEE

22

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

23

MS. WANSLEE:

Briefly, just on this last

24

point, no upset whatsoever to bring this matter back

25

before the bankruptcy court.

Mr. Espinosa is still free

56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to come back to bankruptcy court and argue that he has

2

got an undue hardship.

3

The distributions that are made through a

4

chapter 13 plan are a matter of statutory right, every

5

single adversary -- every single plan that had this

6

illegal plan language could come back and it would not

7

upset anything, nothing would change, no distribution

8

whatsoever.

I think that's an important point.

And to be clear, the chief judge's -- Chief

It just proposed a

14

discharge of a certain amount lesser than the principal

15

plus interest.

MS. WANSLEE:

It had a predicate of

discharge of interest, no predicate of undue hardship.
