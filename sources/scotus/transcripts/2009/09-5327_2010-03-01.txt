CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Scher.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TODD G. SCHER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. SCHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

It is undisputed that Petitioner was not

11

provided notice that the State supreme court had denied

12

his postconviction appeal and had issued its mandate,

13

with the result being that his AEDPA statute of

14

limitations expired.

15

Petitioner immediately prepared a pro se habeas petition

16

and filed it within 24 hours.

17

had taken --

18

The very day he learned this,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Before this, Petitioner

How do -- what in the

19

record shows us that the failure to tell him that by the

20

lawyer was anything other than negligence?

21

record suggests that the lawyer, just as many lawyers

22

do, forgot to call the client, forgot to send him

23

something?

24

negligence?

25

What in the

What shows that this is more than

MR. SCHER:

Well, first of all, we have what
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the Eleventh Circuit characterized Mr. Collins's conduct

2

as, which was gross negligence.

3

is a confluence --

4
5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And what we have here

Well, I'm trying to find

the basis for that finding.

6

MR. SCHER:

We have a repeated pattern.

For

7

example, first of all we have to go back in terms of what

8

happened in State court.

9

assurances to Mr. Holland that he would in fact file his

10

First we have Mr. Collins's

Federal -- or was aware of this --

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

MR. SCHER:

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

But -- but --

I'm sorry.
That's what his intent

was.

15

MR. SCHER:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Correct.
People say I'm going to

17

do something, and they fail to do it often because

18

something else comes up, because something has happened.

19

That doesn't show intentionality in -- the failure to

20

act doesn't necessarily prove that it was intentional.

21

MR. SCHER:

Well -- well, in terms of that

22

what we have here, for example, is Mr. Collins was given

23

two opportunities -- or the record shows that there were

24

two opportunities for Mr. Collins to provide answers to

25

these very questions.

The most significant of those
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

responses was -- was in the Federal district court where

2

the Federal district judge in fact issued a show cause

3

order to Mr. Collins asking him to respond specifically

4

to Mr. Holland's allegations.

5

Collins completely ignored all of Mr. Holland's

6

allegations.

7

to file the petition.

8

fact informed Mr. Holland that he wouldn't -- that he

9

would file the petition.

And in that response Mr.

He never denied that -- being instructed
He never denied that he had in

He never denied any of the

10

allegations with regard to the fact that Mr. Holland

11

wanted that Federal habeas petition filed on time.

12

just went on to address --

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

He

Well, that -- but that's

14

the case in every case where -- where the lawyer is

15

negligent and doesn't do something that -- that should

16

have been done.

17

MR. SCHER:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

Well --

I will take care of your case, and he doesn't do it.

20

MR. SCHER:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22
23

He has assured the client,

Well, here we have -That's all that happened

here.
MR. SCHER:

This -- this goes beyond the

24

case of mere, garden-variety negligence that some of the

25

courts have -- have addressed, because here we have a
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

combination of not only a failure -- we have the failure

2

to notify Mr. Holland that the State supreme court has in

3

fact denied its opinion, despite repeated instructions

4

from Holland to Mr. Collins that he file his petition.

5

Mr. Holland wrote --

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

The facts here -- the facts

7

here are quite extreme, but I am troubled by where you

8

think the line should be drawn.

9

negligence, would that be enough for equitable tolling?

10

MR. SCHER:

If it is just mere

No, courts -- and this Court in

11

Lawrence has held, for example, that mere negligence is

12

not sufficient.

13

suggestive --

14

What we have here certainly is

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well -- the difference

15

between mere negligence and gross negligence -- one of the

16

things I remember most clearly from torts in law school

17

is that that's pretty -- that's an ephemeral

18

distinction.

19

should draw, between mere -- if it's gross negligence,

20

then there's equitable tolling; if it's mere negligence,

21

it's not?

22

But that's the one you one you think we

MR. SCHER:

Well, we know certainly that the

23

floor from -- from cases from this Court and from other

24

courts is this mere or garden-variety negligence.

25

when you get to other factors -6

But

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

2

that be?

3

spends a lot of time trying to find the most competent

4

lawyer he can, and he does.

5

lawyer, who makes one little mistake and it's

6

negligence.

7

Two cases.

Why should -- why should

Two criminal defendants.

One

He finds a highly skilled

The other doesn't care.

He gets a lawyer

8

that's really incompetent, and the lawyer is grossly

9

negligent.

10

Now, you would be penalizing the client who

11

exercised the most diligence under your rule.

12

understand the -- the justice of that.

13

that the first client should be better off, not worse.

14

I don't

It seems to me

Now, maybe this is for your friend on the

15

other side to answer as well, but I'm not sure, even

16

following Justice Alito's initial line of questioning,

17

we can distinguish between gross and mere

18

negligence, that -- that it's even fair that we do so.

19

MR. SCHER:

Well, this Court --

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I didn't mean to interrupt

21

his line of questioning, but it seems to be consistent

22

with it.

23

MR. SCHER:

This and other courts have --

24

have been able to draw that line, and, of course you have

25

to look at the specifics of each particular case,
7
Alderson Reporting Company

1

because not only --

2
3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
the point?

But what's the -- what's

What's the justice in doing that?

4

MR. SCHER:

Well, the way --

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Other than just limit

6

the number of cases in which we are going to set aside

7

convictions?

8
9

MR. SCHER:

Well, in some circumstances,

courts have just said, unfortunately you lose, your

10

attorney didn't commit -- it was just a mere mistake.

11

But what we have here, of course, is not -- we don't

12

have a mere mistake; we have a confluence of these

13

particular factors.

14

points that distinguishes Mr. Holland's case, for

15

example, from Lawrence and from the situation in

16

Coleman, is that Mr. Holland tried to rid himself of Mr.

17

Collins on numerous occasions while this case was in

18

State court.

19

petitioners were not allowed to be free of their

20

lawyers; they accepted those lawyers’ representation --

21

they accepted their representation and the acts and

22

omissions that occurred in Lawrence and in Coleman were

23

attributed to -- to the petitioners in those cases.

24
25

And I think one of the more salient

In Lawrence and in Coleman, the

Here, however, by contrast, Mr. Holland did
everything he could -- he could, to be -- reasonably, to
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

be free of --

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Are you -- are you

3

suggesting that there should be a different standard for

4

those habeas petitioners who are -- whose counsel is

5

appointed for them by the State or by the Federal

6

government, as opposed to just a lawyer they hire?

7

That's what I'm hearing you say.

8
9

MR. SCHER:

No, and I didn't mean to suggest

that --

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So if the

11

standard is going to be the same -- I -- I go back to

12

Justice Alito's question, which is, the Eleventh Circuit

13

is saying negligence/gross negligence, the line is too

14

fine to draw.

15

between negligence, however one defines it, and an

16

intentional, bad faith, dishonest, conflicted

17

malfeasance.

But there is a difference in a line

18

MR. SCHER:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Correct.
All right.

Why isn't

20

that a more workable line, given that you can't have

21

equitable tolling without exceptional circumstances?

22

MR. SCHER:

Correct enough, but I think

23

each -- well, certainly those were some of the

24

individual factors that the Eleventh Circuit discussed

25

when saying gross negligence isn't enough.
9
Alderson Reporting Company

I think in

Official

1

Mr. Holland's case --

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You haven't argued why

3

not, is what I'm saying to you.

4

circumstances has to mean something that really makes

5

something exceptional, why is negligence of any variant

6

exceptional?

7

MR. SCHER:

If exceptional

Because when you look at, for

8

example, in this particular case, when we are talking

9

about an exceptional circumstance, you’re talking

10

about a lot of times -- and courts have done this --

11

is the confluence of what the attorney did or didn't do

12

versus what the petitioner did.

13

So we have, of course -- along the lines of

14

the extraordinary circumstances here, we have

15

Petitioner's diligence.

16

dovetail.

17

say we don't care what the Petitioner did; we don't

18

really care what the lawyer did; anything the lawyer did

19

unless the lawyer was mentally ill or had divided

20

loyalties, then that’s -- those are the only factors that

21

were going to be considered in terms of equitable

22

tolling.

23
24
25

And in some respects they

And I think what the Eleventh Circuit did was

But that is -- that is antithetical to
the very nature of equity.

Here --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We've never held that

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

equitable tolling for anything is available under this

2

statute of limitations here.

3
4
5

MR. SCHER:

That's correct.

This Court,

however -JUSTICE SCALIA:

And why should it be?

It

6

seems to me, this is not like the ordinary statute of

7

limitations, where it says, you know, the statute is five

8

years, and courts make all sorts of necessary exceptions

9

to the five years.

But here you have a statute that --

10

that provides exceptions, for example, “the limitation

11

period shall run from the latest of the date on which

12

the impediment to filing an application created by State

13

action in violation … is removed.” In other words, we’re

14

going to toll it for that particular event.

15

“The date on which the constitutional right

16

asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme

17

Court” -- we’re going to toll it for that.

18

“The date on which the factual predicate of

19

the claim or claims presented could have been discovered

20

through exercise of due diligence.”

21

Many of -- many of the equitable tolling

22

holdings involved precisely that.

23

you couldn't have found out about the violation within

24

the statutory period.

25

We’ll toll it since

But all of these things are handled already
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in 2244(d).

2

right to create some additional exceptions from the --

3

from the 1-year period?

4

Why should we -- why should we assume the

MR. SCHER:

Well, with all due respect, I

5

don't concur with the premise that those four particular

6

subsections of 2244(d) are exceptions or -- or are

7

tolling provisions.

8

that those four, (a), (b), (c) and (d), are --

9
10

Indeed, this Court in Jimenez said

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How many circuits have

said that there is equitable tolling?

11

MR. SCHER:

Eleven circuits -- all of the

12

circuits, and the only circuit that hasn't held that is

13

the D.C. Circuit where it remains an open question.

14

all of the circuits that have addressed --

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So

Then it's a question of

16

what are exceptional circumstances and whether it has to

17

be something deliberate, which is what the -- as I

18

understand it, the Michigan Court of Appeals said --

19

yes, if it was bad faith -- if it was a lie, a

20

deception --

21

MR. SCHER:

Correct.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And, in fact --

So they’re drawing the

23

line between intentional and -- and without intending

24

but just being careless.

25

MR. SCHER:

Correct.

And, certainly here, I

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

think we have what they deemed to be gross negligence,

2

which I think certainly has an element of, let's say, for

3

example, to use the term "recklessness."

4

got six or seven circuits which have addressed this

5

particular issue in terms of this line between mere

6

negligence and -- and something more than that, and those

7

circuits have all -- in the 13 or 14 years since AEDPA

8

has been around, all been able to effectively deal with

9

these particular cases on their particular facts.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, we've

We have a case this

11

afternoon involving an opinion of ours named McNally,

12

which held that there's no such thing as a fraud action

13

for a right to honest services.

14

of appeals had held that there did exist such a right

15

when we held that there didn't in McNally?

16

MR. SCHER:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How many of the courts

I'm not familiar.
Every single court of

18

appeals that had faced it had held that there was such a

19

right.

20

appeals that have found that they have extraordinary

21

power -- judges like to find that they have power -- and

22

that doesn't necessarily make it right.

23
24
25

So the mere fact that you have 11 court of

MR. SCHER:

Well -- and I --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Of course, that also

assumes that McNally was correctly decided -13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

(Laughter.)

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

3

-- and I don’t think it was.

May I ask you another

4

MR. SCHER:

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

question --

Yes.
-- prompted by Justice

6

Kennedy's question?

7

look at the probable merit of the underlying claim in

8

evaluating the issue?

9
10

Have any of the circuits taken a

MR. SCHER:

In this particular case or in

another case?

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, not in this particular

12

case.

13

the client whether it's negligence or gross negligence,

14

and I'm just asking whether in any of the reviews of this

15

issue, that you are familiar with, have they sometimes

16

looked at the probable merit of the claim, and if there

17

was merit, why, you were more disturbed about attorney

18

negligence, whereas if it's a frivolous claim, they

19

wouldn't be.

20

at that at all?

21

But Justice Kennedy says it's equally unjust to

But do you know if any of them take a look

MR. SCHER:

There are certainly some cases

22

that address the tolling and then, of course, address the

23

merits of the petition.

24

that link the two.

25

example -- the Respondent has argued that the floodgates

I don't know that there are any

But, certainly, if you have, for

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

are just going open, but certainly one of the -- one of

2

the ways that a Federal district court can deal with

3

this and has dealt with this in the past 13 years is to

4

look at the petition.

5

something that’s so palpably meritless, you don't even

6

need to get to anything about whether it’s -- just

7

dismiss the petition because, of course, the vast

8

majority of cases that AEDPA addresses in this particular

9

chapter are noncapital cases and are pro se cases.

10

And if the petition raises

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I looked in the brief to

11

see if there was reference to the merits, underlying

12

merits of the case.

13

what the key arguments are, if we ever reach the merits?

Can you just tell me very quickly

14

MR. SCHER:

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

MR. SCHER:

In the Petitioner's case?
Yes.

He had -- well, there were a

17

number of issues that he raised on direct appeal.

18

was issues regarding counsel.

19

the postconviction motion, one of the key issues was he

20

had a what's termed in Florida “a Nixon issue,” which is

21

where counsel conceded some of the elements of the

22

crime.

record.

There

For example, I know in

1

MR. SCHER:

2

But -- but --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Scher, one point that

3

you didn't mention, but you did I thought stress it in

4

your brief, was that counsel here said:

5

deadline had run even before I was engaged, even before

6

I was appointed to represent this man, so there was

7

nothing that I could do for him, because the time had

8

already expired.

9

MR. SCHER:

Oh, the

That's correct,

10

Justice Ginsburg.

11

explanation came up after the fact.

12

significant about that, number one, is that his

13

explanations have been a moving target to a large

14

extent.

15

that information was ever imparted to Mr. Holland while

16

the case was pending.

17

What happened is that that particular
I think what's

But what's even more important is that none of

While Mr. Collins was providing assurances

18

and reassurances to Mr. Holland -- about, don't

19

worry, your State postconviction motion will be filed

20

on time, your Federal rights will be honored, everything

21

will be done, your appeal will be taken, once we are

22

done in the Florida Supreme Court we will go off to the

23

Federal district court -- at no time did Mr. Collins ever

24

say:

25

run, and so we need to start thinking in advance of ways

We've got a big problem here; the statute may have

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to deal with this.

2

For example, if Mr. Collins truly

3

believed that the statute had already run, the day the

4

Florida Supreme Court issued that decision, he should

5

have been in Federal court filing something right away.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could you just tell me in a

7

sentence or two what test you think we should apply for

8

equitable tolling?

9

to be equitable tolling?

10

What is necessary in order for there

MR. SCHER:

Your Honor, I think the -- the

11

test is the test that this Court has applied, which is

12

in Pace and in Lawrence, which is extraordinary

13

circumstances coupled with diligence.

14

those particular -- coupled with diligence, the

15

Petitioner's diligence.

16
17

JUSTICE ALITO:

I think under

What does "extraordinary

circumstances" mean?

18

MR. SCHER:

It's -- it’s a case-by-case type of

19

issue.

It's because it's an equitable remedy.

20

something that’s susceptible to rigid rules, which of

21

course is the problem with the Eleventh Circuit's

22

categorical exclusion of a particular large chunk of

23

misconduct on the part of the attorney.

24

here, where we have extraordinary circumstances, we have

25

lack of notice to the Petitioner that his State court
17
Alderson Reporting Company

It's not

But certainly

Official

1

opinion had been issued, that they had affirmed, that

2

the mandate had come out; and a failure to communicate,

3

wholesale failure to communicate, bordering on, in fact,

4

abandonment --

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

All of that has nothing to

6

do with -- with what caused -- what caused the inability

7

to -- to bring the habeas action.

8

MR. SCHER:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well -All of that is -- is

10

preliminary to that.

11

irresponsible lawyer, but that has nothing to do with

12

the event that -- the simple event, failure to file in

13

that what, 30-day period, which --

14

MR. SCHER:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This may have been a very

Fourteen days.
Fourteen days.

16

me "extraordinary" means unusual.

17

event is a possible?

18

MR. SCHER:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It seems to

So you say any unusual

Well, I think the one -Any unusual event is a

20

possible for a court to say, oh, yes, it says a year,

21

but this is unusual so we will give you a year and a

22

half.

23

MR. SCHER:

Well, I think what we have here

24

is what makes this case I think unusual, and it's the

25

first type of case that this Court has seen, is under
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

these circumstances you have this confluence of events.

2

And I think what makes this case -- what sets this case

3

apart from the other ones that this Court has seen and

4

that certainly other courts have seen is, for example,

5

it's extraordinary -- or it was diligent for Mr. Holland

6

to have asked the Florida Supreme Court on two occasions

7

to rid himself of Collins, and he asked to proceed pro se.

8
9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The client -- this client

was sort of the pesky client, but apparently knew a lot

10

more about AEDPA than most people generally do.

11

AEDPA's not exactly an ordinary term.

12
13
14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean,

And had a lot of time to

devote to it.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And -- and suppose you have a

15

client who is just bewildered.

He doesn't know AEDPA;

16

he doesn't know Federal court.

Why should he be in any

17

worse position than this client?

18

MR. SCHER:

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well -It seems to me it would be

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

the ignorant client, could never have approached this.

2

I don't know why he shouldn't be more protected than

3

your client, which goes back to Justice Alito's question.

4

I'm not sure how we draw this line.

5

MR. SCHER:

I think the problem we have here

6

with Mr. Holland is that the more diligent he was, the

7

more the Respondent and the lower courts have said he

8

should have done.

9

you should have done A, B, and C.

10

And so he did X, Y, and Z; they say

But what I think is -- is significant here

11

is he was stuck with this lawyer.

12

the lawyer.

13

not only can you not fire him, you can't file a pro se

14

motion because you are represented by the lawyer.

15

Mr. Holland hears from the courts is that:

16

to us and we can't speak to you.

17

He tried to get rid of

The State filed motions saying you can't --

So all

You can't speak

So he's stuck.

And then, of course, he's writing to the

18

Florida Supreme Court clerk begging for information, and

19

in fact in footnote 11 of the brief --

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But he never asked -- he

21

wrote to the clerk, but he never asked to be informed

22

when the judgment came down.

23

MR. SCHER:

Well, what we have, Your Honor,

24

is if you look on page 11, in footnote 11, Mr. Holland

25

wrote a letter to the Florida Supreme Court clerk,

It's

What we have here is Petitioner putting the
Florida Supreme Court on explicit notice that he is

10

having a problem with his lawyer, and further -- earlier

11

in that particular letter, he apologizes to the clerk,

12

saying:

13

requests, but if I had a lawyer who was responding to my

14

letters and who was listening to me and who would send

15

me the documentations, I wouldn't have to be bothering

16

you, but this is the situation that I'm in.

17

I'm sorry to pester you with these -- with these

And then, of course, he tries to not only have

18

Mr. Collins substituted, but he asks to go pro se.

19

That's an extraordinary circumstance.

20

even further, more extraordinary is the State coming in

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is this case

4

a lot going on, but if the lawyer just miscalculated the

5

days and was off by one day, this case comes out the

6

other way in your view, right?

7

MR. SCHER:

I think not only under my -- I

8

think, certainly, courts have -- have discussed this, that

9

that's -- that's just an unfortunate mere mistake.

But I

10

think certainly we don't have that under the facts of

18

it's not abandonment of a client in the sense of not

But this lawyer filed a
He missed
But

So it goes back to my beginning question,

21

which is, where is the line drawn between the types of

22

negligence and what the circuit suggested, which is some

23

sort of intentional malfeasance?

24
25

MR. SCHER:

And I didn't mean to suggest --

when I -- when I used the word "abandonment," I'm -- I'm
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

referring to, of course, in terms of abandonment with

2

regard to preserving -- enforcing the assurances that

3

Collins had made with respect to filing the petition.

4

And, of course, he also had told -- that --

5

Mr. Holland that he would inform him of the Florida

6

Supreme Court's decision, because that, of course, is

7

the triggering date.

8
9

We have Mr. Holland, who had already been -you know, asked his lawyer, you know, please file

10

certain issues in my case and please keep me informed.

11

When those two promises and assurances were not kept by

12

the lawyer, Mr. Holland at that point has reason to be

13

concerned that the additional promise, which is, I will

14

file on time, was not going to be honored.

15

And so Mr. Holland embarked on a series of

16

diligent steps in order to get some information, but he

17

didn't know where to turn.

18

example, he writes to the clerk's office of the supreme

19

court.

20

they tell him to send a check.

21

And, then, of course, for

Sometimes they send him information; sometimes

He doesn't know.

He is not getting any

22

consistency, and he's certainly not getting any response

23

from his attorney.

24
25

Then he files these motions in the State
supreme court, which are opposed by the State as
23
Alderson Reporting Company

1

nullities because he is represented by counsel.

2

writes to the Florida Supreme Court saying, can you give

3

me the information about your Web site -- maybe I can have

4

some friends look up this case.

5

knows at this point that there is a problem, and he

6

knows that the triggering date for the filing in the

7

Federal petition is the denial by the Florida Supreme

8

Court and the issuance of the mandate.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

He then

Because, of course, he

Then you are -- you

10

seem, from what you just said, to be relying on a

11

distinction between paid counsel, who is just as

12

careless, and court-appointed counsel, because in the

13

one case the client had picked that attorney, and in the

14

other case, the client was given this attorney by the

15

State.

16

some responsibility when it provides the counsel.

17

So I think you’re suggesting that the State has

be the same if you were not making a distinction between

19

court-appointed and paid counsel.

20

MR. SCHER:

I think the -- the distinction

21

that I was making -- I'm not saying that there's a

22

difference in terms of paid or appointed counsel, but

23

here where you have appointed counsel, I think one of

the extraordinary factors is the State coming in and --

Everything has to be funneled through your lawyer.

5

10

He would have gotten copied with the

5

MR. MAKAR:

I can tell you anecdotally the

6

attorneys that handle these cases in Florida, that the

7

equitable tolling issue comes up with some regularity.

8

I’m aware of three cases just in Jacksonville where I

9

live where the district judge there has had evidentiary

10

hearings and has looked at these equitable tolling issues.

11

In Florida, we have 394 individuals on death

12

row, and those cases are at various stages in the

13

litigation.

14

goes on.

15

So there is a certain amount of that that

As to the noncapital cases, we know that

16

the system is flooded with habeas petitions.

17

most of those are unrepresented.

18

those cases -- a study I saw recently, a 2007 study from

19

Vanderbilt University, that about 20 percent of those

20

cases are dismissed on statute of limitations grounds.

21

I’m inferring from that that there is some equitable

22

tolling action going on there, but the specific amount

23

we’re not sure of.

24

and noncapital area, this is an issue.

25

Obviously,

obviously, we’re asking this Court to use the analysis

2

it has done in other cases to find that there is no

3

equitable tolling whatsoever.

If you’re going to read it in some cases you can do it,

1

then I guess we’re at a discussion of is this one of

2

those cases?

3

MR. MAKAR:

Well, two responses.

Number

4

one, we do not believe that equitable tolling was

5

intended by Congress under this complex statute of

6

limitations for all the reasons set out in our brief.

7
8

JUSTICE BREYER:

So that’s earthquake,

fire, flood, et cetera?

9

MR. MAKAR:

Exactly.

And it relates to the

10

same result, it seems -- to the same result as this Court

11

came to in Beggerly and Brockamp, where the -- if

12

Congress intended that to be the case, that's the case.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if the lawyer lies to

14

the client and the client says my time is running out,

15

have you filed my -- my Federal habeas petition, and the

16

lawyer says, yes, I filed it and here it is, and it has

17

a -- a forged date stamp on it?

18

there?

19

MR. MAKAR:

No equitable tolling

Well, under our position that

20

Congress intended to draw a very clear line, no.

21

the -- if the Court assumes or decides there is some

22

sort of equitable tolling, then that's a different case,

23

and -- and in those situations where there’s something

24

beyond the incompetence of the lawyer.

25

If the Court decides there is equitable tolling or
29
Alderson Reporting Company

If

And that's our rule.

Official

1

assumes it exists, it has to be that the rule that the

2

incompetence of the postconviction counsel cannot be a

3

basis for relief.

4

That's what this Court has essentially said

5

in Lawrence and also in Coleman, and also what Congress

6

inferentially said in -- in 2254(i).

7

So, under those circumstances, here our rule

8

works because you don't get into those gradations of

9

negligence, you know, is it gross negligence?

Well,

10

how gross? And the bottom line here in this particular case,

11

of course -- and the Court has asked these questions

12

here -- is what really happened in this case?

13

had was a Lawrence error, which was --

14

15

It's certainly unusual.

16

is he diligent?

17

All you

Well, why should it matter?

Isn't that what we are after, one,

Answer, yes, he has been diligent.

Two, is it extraordinary?

I would think it

18

was fairly extraordinary that a person writes these letters

to counsel and so forth, then the -- the thing isn't

20

filed.

Is that extraordinary or not?
Whether it was his fault, whether he himself

was kidnapped.

I mean, maybe it wasn't the counsel's

fault.

it fair?

extraordinary?

3

5

counsel -- when their client specifically says to them,

6

6

I don't understand why -- how -- how you can deny the

No, I think that certainly the

11

filing of the motion, I think perhaps it was -- it shouldn't

12

have been stricken the first time, but the court then on the

13

merits denied it the second time.

14

forget who alluded to it -- this has been somewhat of an

15

unusual case from the outset, in that if you look at the

16

three Florida Supreme Court opinions that have been

17

issued in this case, it shows that at the first trial

18

Holland absented himself from the -- absented himself

19

from the trial and he had to watch on circuit --

20

closed-circuit TV because he was being very difficult.

21

And keep in mind -- I

And then in the second trial, we had two

22

Faretta hearings amounting to hundreds of pages in which

23

the Florida Supreme Court then said, well, he wants to

24

represent himself, but he can't conduct himself properly

25

and so forth.

And also there's the issue of his -- his
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

-- there’s a mental issue there as well, that he has

2

raised on appeal as well.

3

So the court -- the Florida courts are sort

4

of put in this difficult posture of saying, we want you

5

to have counsel, we need you to have counsel because we

6

want you to have effective representation, but then

7

throughout the process here it's been a difficult,

8

difficult number of decades, essentially, in this

9

situation.

So I think it's an unfair characterization

10

to say that the Florida courts and also the Office of

11

Attorney General who -- who routinely moves to

12

strike these -- it's not because we're trying to deny

13

anyone's day in court.

14

and they have to speak to the lawyer, and the hybrid

15

representation is impermissible.

It's because you have a lawyer

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So -Can we go back to

just --

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The State -- the State

19

has no responsibility even though it made this

20

appointment?

21

whether it was paid counsel, somebody that the -- that

22

the defendant picked to represent him, and someone that

23

he just had to take because it's what the State gave him?

24
25

So you agree there's no difference,

MR. MAKAR:

Exactly.

And -- and that's the

way the Court's decision in Coleman has allocated the
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

burdens and the risks.

2

okay, if it's a direct appeal where the State is charged

3

with that responsibility, that's one thing; but when

4

it's postconviction, it's shifted.

5

and whole structure is flipped the other way, and you,

6

the Petitioner, bear the burden, and not the State.

7

This is important under AEDPA, because AEDPA --

8
9

I mean, what the Court said was

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The whole paradigm

Under -- on direct appeal,

if counsel conducted himself this way, the State

10

would -- he’d have to get relief because the State

11

would have the burden, but not -- not on collateral?

12

Is that what you're saying?

13

MR. MAKAR:

Sure.

On direct appeal, if the

14

lawyer is deemed to be ineffective, then that would be a

15

constitutional error, and that would be subject to some

16

sort of relief, but it flips in the postconviction

17

stage, as this Court has held in Coleman.

or so forth cannot be a basis for equitable tolling.

hypotheticals where some, you know, very unusual, bizarre

situation comes in that’s external to the

12

attorney-client relationship, perhaps those -- those

13

could be considered.

14

But we believe that the Congress, through its

15

purpose in enacting this statute of limitations, a

16

complex one that has exceptions, that -- that is

17

designed to alleviate the burdens and delays -- its intent

18

was not to allow equitable tolling, because we --

says otherwise, there is equitable tolling.

5

is that you’re confusing the -- or perceive --

24
25

Well --- in its traditional

Most of the cases in equitable tolling, by the way,

MR. MAKAR:

Sure.

What we’re suggesting is

that under the structure of the Brockamp decision, what
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the Court looked at there to determine when there is no

2

equitable tolling intended by Congress, that here

3

likewise there is no equitable tolling, and as the Court

4

held in Brockamp, the fact that there may be unfairness

5

in individual cases was the price Congress was willing

6

to pay, the tradeoff it was willing to allow, to have a

7

habeas system that was functioning.

8
9

Now, assuming that position is rejected by
the Court or the Court assumes equitable tolling, the

10

next question is what should be allowed.

11

it has to be exceptionally narrow.

12

this case -- and this case is all about attorney

13

negligence or attorney gross negligence -- those --

14

those sort of circumstances are not enough.

MR. MAKAR:

Well, we agree with the Eleventh

Circuit standard to the extent it says, you know, that this

sort of attorney negligence, gross negligence, incompetence,

14

is not enough.

15

is we're concerned, based upon our pragmatic day-in,

16

day-out handling of these cases, that when you say

17

dishonesty, well -- or a conflict -- that those concepts

18

can be conflated into things that they are not,

So we are

And as I say, the analysis here of

7

purpose of AEDPA, structure of AEDPA, and the

8

burdens -- as I say, the burdens are important to the

9

State and to the court system.

I was looking at that

10

recent study, the 2007 study, that seemed to suggest

11

that AEDPA is -- basically, when these cases are being

12

filed in Federal district court, it has taken a year and

13

a half to 2, 3 years for them to be resolved, and in

14

this case keep in mind it took 18 months in the district

15

court, 18 months in the Eleventh Circuit, and then

16

further.

17

But that’s allowing the invocation of this

doctrine, not just in this case.

noncapital context as well, that that will somehow put

20

an end to the importance of what Congress enacted.

5

which has left the question open to provide guidance on

6

that issue, and we suggest that either there be no

7

equitable tolling or that, if there is to be equitable

extreme attorney incompetence to miss a deadline?

MR. MAKAR:

Well, I guess the short answer,

of course, is the courts have said no, that's not

We probably

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TODD G. SCHER

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

7

MR. SCHER:

I just have a couple of brief

8

points.

First, to clarify, the Respondent argued that

9

Mr. Holland never asked to proceed pro se in the State

10

court, and that’s just incorrect, and it's flatly

11

contradicted by their brief on page 43, where they

12

write:

any issues Holland desired) or to proceed pro se if

15

substitute counsel could not be appointed."

16

"Holland moved to replace Collins with another

And I think, again, going back to one of

17

the things that Justice Breyer was discussing with

18

Respondent's counsel, was I think that that -- the

19

problem with the Eleventh Circuit's analysis is this

20

categorical exclusion.

21

extraordinary circumstances have to be considered as

22

a -- consider all the circumstances, and so to

23

categorically exclude this one particular area,

we submit, is what the problem is here.

you start saying, well, you can forgive an inequitable case,

4

The lawyer goofed.

Of course, you don't want to penalize the

5

client, but Congress obviously had something more in

6

mind.

7

MR. SCHER:

Well, but certainly -- but the other

8

part of the test for equitable tolling is diligence, and

9

I think, when -- when one looks at the -- at the body of

10

case law that has developed since 1997 on the issue of

11

equitable tolling and AEDPA, the vast majority of these

12

cases are disposed on the fact that the Petitioner is

13

indiligent.

14

Here, of course, the Respondent, if I heard

15

correctly, is now conceding that the Petitioner was

16

diligent.

17

even having to get to the question of exceptional

18

circumstances; for example, just looking to the

19

diligence prong.

20

And so there are certainly other ways to avoid

But here, where you have a failure to

21

notify, you have the failure to heed the instructions from

22

a client, you have the client saying you’ve lied to

23

me, the client telling the State and the Federal courts

all of those factors certainly go to a consideration of

whether equitable tolling should be warranted, and the
