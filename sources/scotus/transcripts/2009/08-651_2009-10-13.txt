ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. KINNAIRD

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KINNAIRD:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Kentucky Supreme Court announced a

11
12

categorical rule so restrictive of the Sixth Amendment

13

that the United States Government disavows it.

14

court held that the Sixth Amendment never provides a

15

remedy to a defendant who pleads guilty to a crime on

16

the false advice of his attorney that he would not be

17

deported as a result.

The

The narrowest ground on which this Court may

18
19

reverse the Kentucky Supreme Court is to hold that

20

misadvice claims are cognizable under the Sixth

21

Amendment.

22

Any advice that a lawyer actually gives to a

23

defendant on whether to plead guilty is advice affecting

24

criminal liability.

25

Amendment competency standards.

Such advice must meet Sixth

Well, other advice

-- for example, advice about whether to take the stand

3

--that can have significant collateral consequences –

4

you know, he might lose his job or lose government

5

contracts based on what he says, is that the sort of

6

advice that would be covered in -- under your position?

7

MR. KINNAIRD:

I think, for misadvice, the

8

test would be whether it's a material misrepresentation

9

that would be material to a reasonable defendant in

10

deciding whether to plead guilty, so it would -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

Only plead guilty?

12

Not, for example, whether it would be material to the

13

defendant in deciding whether or not to take the stand?
MR. KINNAIRD:

14

I think to plead guilty is

15

the key strategic decision that is in the -- in the

16

client's sole duty and prerogative, to make that

17

decision.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why would it be limited to a

19

decision to plead guilty?

20

guilty would have lesser immigration consequences than a

21

guilty verdict after -- after going to trial?

22

you have the same situation there?

23

MR. KINNAIRD:

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. KINNAIRD:

And he goes to trial?
Right.
I think that -- that would

13

only be a Strickland claim if this Court were prepared

14

to rule that going to trial is ever prejudice under

15

Strickland, and there is a circuit split on that.

16

But the concern of the Sixth Amendment --

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

But do you see a difference

18

in principle between the two situations with respect to

19

the issue that is before us here?
MR. KINNAIRD:

I'm not sure that there would

1

you are now talking about a narrow ground, misadvice.

2

But you are also urging that when the lawyer is

3

silent on a matter that he should inform the defendant,

4

that, too, is covered.

5

But whichever way you do it, how do you --

6

you say certainly deportation is a consequence that the

7

defendant should be told about.

8
9

What about -- how do you distinguish that
from, say, you'll lose your driver's license, you'll

10

lose your right to vote?

11

consequences that count and those that don't?

12

MR. KINNAIRD:

How do we distinguish the

Your Honor, the issue here is

13

simply the legal standard that applies to any -- any

14

of these claims, and it would be the same two-part

15

standard under Strickland v. Washington.

16

there is no need to draw lines.

17

So there --

If this Court is troubled by a broad rule

18

and is inclined not to issue a general rule, it may

19

simply recognize deportation as among the few collateral

20

consequences that is so severe and so material in a high

21

number of cases in which it applies that the Strickland

22

claim should be allowed to go forward.

23

And it can leave for another day whether

24

there are other consequences that are too burdensome for

25

the system to recognize.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, we can't leave that

for another day.

3

whether we are opening a Pandora's box here, whether

4

there is any sensible way to restrict it to -- to

5

deportation.

6

I mean, we -- we have to decide

What about advice on whether pleading guilty

7

would -- would cause him to lose custody of his

8

children?

9

That's -- that's pretty serious.
What if pleading guilty will -- will affect

10

whether he can keep his truck, which is his main means

11

of livelihood, or whether -- whether it would be seized

12

by the government as the instrument of his crime?

13

There are so many pieces of advice which

14

involve legal issues that -- that counsel can provide

15

advice on.
MR. KINNAIRD:

Your Honor, I think that is

precisely why we have the contextual inquiry of

and to prove -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If we were in -- if we

3

were in the contract, civil contract situation, and

4

there’s a mistake, the usual rule -- Restatement of

5

Contracts -- is that the -- the question is whether or

6

not it's reasonable to have the party who made the

7

mistake bear the risk.

8
9

Suppose we just had an instruction, Rule 11
-- I recognize this is a State case -- but we had a Rule

10

11 instruction, which said the only thing the court is

11

going to inquire about and the only thing that was of

12

relevance to your plea are criminal consequences.

13

You take the risk of any misadvice, any

14

misunderstanding, with respect to collateral conduct.

15

That's your risk, and it's part of the guilty plea.

16

we said that, would that foreclose this kind of argument

17

in your case?

18

MR. KINNAIRD:

If

No, Your Honor, because the

subjective risk preferences of the defendant as between

JUSTICE ALITO:

Your argument has -- has an

13

appeal because removal is such a harsh consequence,

14

particularly for someone like your client who had been

15

in the United States for a long time.

16

me about it is the situation in which the defendant

17

claims -- you know, let's say 5 years after entering a

18

guilty plea or after the passage of some time – that

19

misadvice was given, and the -- the attorney on the

20

other side is a busy public defender who by that time

21

has handled 500 cases and is unable to remember what, if

22

anything, was said about the immigration consequences of

23

the case; there is nothing in the file.

24

those cases going to be handled?

25

MR. KINNAIRD:

But what troubles

I mean, how are

Well, I think that, Your

1

Honor, that’s no different than any Strickland claim

2

that would be brought in the same time frame.

almost always brought as collateral attacks, and there

are many Federal and State strictures on bringing those

6

claims, including time limits.

7

anything categorically different from the ordinary

8

Strickland claim in your case.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

And there

So I don't think there’s

Well, isn't there -- isn’t

it different in that the ordinary Strickland claim

said anything about removal, and I can't remember the

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, I suppose

4

-- before a guilty plea is accepted, the district court

judge is obligated to go through a colloquy to make sure

MR. KINNAIRD:

No, Your Honor, it would not.

The -- that's a due process inquiry that is implemented

13

by Rule 11 in the Federal courts.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that's -- that's --

15

with due respect, that's ridiculous.

16

enough to be required to be told to the defendant by his

17

counsel, surely it's important enough to be advised to

18

the defendant by the court before the guilty plea is

19

accepted as -- as voluntary, which includes knowing –-

20

knowing the consequences.

draw between what we are going to hold counsel to and

22

what we are going to require the defendant to be advised

23

of by the court.

MR. KINNAIRD:

If it's important

It's a very strange line you

I don't think that's true,

Your Honor, and the reason is that there are all manner

of strategic types of advice that counsel give that are

2

no province of the district court.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

3

MR. KINNAIRD:

14

It would not.

It would be --

15

it would probably be a salutary practice, and in about

16

half the States, there is --

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The -- the judge would not

be exceeding his -- his commission, his authority, to

19

determine just whether this is knowing and voluntary in

the sense of knowing -- knowing the criminal

consequences of -- I mean, in the criminal system

22

itself?

23

MR. KINNAIRD:

No, Your Honor.

My only

24

point is it would not be required under Rule 11 or

25

required under the Due Process Clause.

13
Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But it seems to me a

2

careful district judge would have to do this if you

3

prevail.

4

MR. KINNAIRD:

It -- it would be a

5

beneficial practice, but if the attorneys live up to

6

their obligations to properly apprise the clients, then

7

that is unnecessary, because the Brady voluntariness

8

standard is predicated on an assumption that the

9

defendant has been competently advised by his counsel.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You were about to say

11

that in many States the trial judge does inform a

12

defendant who is an alien of immigration consequences.

13

MR. KINNAIRD:

It's -- it’s a much more

14

limited advisement.

15

you may be subject to immigration consequences.

they don't actually make any determination.

MR. KINNAIRD:

cannot do that by simply focusing on -- in isolation, on

16

consequences under a civil law, but to attach them to a

strategic decision to plead guilty.

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Right.

Mr. Dreeben, we

MR. DREEBEN:

What we think, Justice

defendant.

And that is a task

The court does not go

Defense counsel must.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think when we --

when we decide there's no right to counsel, like on

collateral review, we don't even look at what happened,

10

We don't look and see whether the advice was

ineffective, how bad the lawyer was.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, then, if there

2

is no right to counsel, why do we get into whether there

3

is an affirmative misrepresentation or not?

4

MR. DREEBEN:

Because --

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Just like in a

6

collateral -- habeas context, we don't care whether

7

there’s an affirmative misreputation –-

8

misrepresentation, because there’s no right to counsel

9

in the first place.

10

MR. DREEBEN:

I think it's because the

11

lawyer has an additional duty in the context of advising

12

his client whether to take a guilty plea, and that is

13

the duty to respect that the decision whether to plead

14

guilty belongs to the defendant personally.

15

decision that can be exercised by proxy by the lawyer.

16

And the lawyer's duty to respect that, whatever advice

17

he gives, the defendant must be able to make his own

18

personal decision, imposes a concomitant duty not to

19

interfere with or undermine the defendant's ability to

20

make an intelligent decision with the information he

21

has.

22

It's not a

So if a lawyer chooses, when asked about

23

collateral consequences, as many aliens will do –- will

Alderson Reporting Company

2

lawyer.

3

I am your criminal

And that's perfectly fine.

But if a lawyer

4

goes beyond that and says, don't worry about it; you've

5

been in the country so long; you are not going to get

6

deported -- with the understanding and the backdrop

7

that this is an important factor in whether this

8

defendant is going to decide to take a guilty plea or to

9

go to trial -- then the lawyer has used his professional

10

skills to undermine a personal decision that belongs to

11

the defendant alone.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What -- what about

13

misadvice as to whether he will lose custody of his

14

children, or misadvice as to whether his -- his truck

15

which he owns will be confiscated by the government?

16

MR. DREEBEN:

I would put them, Justice

17

Scalia, all in the same general basket, which is to say,

18

misadvice on a legal matter of importance to the

19

defendant that could skew his decision to plead guilty

20

may be deficient representation under Strickland.

21

think what was --

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Not the defendant,

23

MR. DREEBEN:

7

the children, so it's not a big deal to him.

8
9

MR. DREEBEN:

You

I actually think that would be

quite relevant, because if any misadvice did not cause

10

the defendant to plead guilty because it was irrelevant

11

to him, then the defendant should not be able to get in

12

the door with an ineffective assistance claim.

13

And I also think if the defendant hasn't

14

manifested in some way that the particular collateral

15

consequence is important to that defendant, then the

16

lawyer certainly has no obligation even under

17

professional standards --

The rule right now in 10 Federal circuits

MR. DREEBEN:

the lower courts that have looked at this I think have

that the rules committee for the criminal rules has

7

may want to take into account removal consequences of a

8

criminal conviction.

9

The latter part is a Sixth

And I think it's highly notable

In other words, there are rule-based ways to

10

address some of the concerns that Justice Alito raised

11

without constitutionalizing a new area of collateral

12

consequences that would impose new duties that actually

13

would divert the lawyer from his criminal law function,

14

whereas the misadvice line has not created those

15

problems.

16

And as I started to say earlier, the fact

17

that 10 Federal circuits have said no duty to advise on

18

collateral consequences, while 7 have recognized that

19

misadvice on collateral consequences can provide

20

relief, has not led to a series of difficult Strickland

21

hearings that are unmanageable.

show what he should have to show to establish prejudice:

14

First, that subjectively he would not have pleaded

15

guilty had he been given correct immigration advice;

16

and, second, that a reasonable defendant would have had

17

a basis not to plead guilty, because if the defendant is

18

going to be convicted after a trial in any event, the

19

same collateral consequence is going to ensue.

defendant will not evade the collateral consequences of

removal if the defendant was going to be convicted at a

MR. LONG:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the Court:

2

In Hill v. Lockhart, this Court again

3

focused on voluntariness and said that voluntariness of

4

the plea depends on counsel's advice and whether that

5

counsel advice is in the range of competence of the

6

attorneys in a criminal proceeding.

7

Again, the focus was on voluntary.

And in

8

Brady, this Court described a voluntary plea as "a plea

9

entered by one possessing full knowledge of direct

10

consequences."

Thus, reading the cases together, it

11

would appear that the defendant need to have only

12

knowledge -- full knowledge of direct consequences, and

13

advice of counsel is just a tool to ensure that.

MR. LONG:

Potentially yes, Your Honor.

And

4

And in --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought the point is

5

that -- I thought your point was that –- that Strickland

6

does require professional norms to be observed, but it

7

is professional norms regarding advising a defendant as

8

to the trial consequences of his plea, as to those

9

matters that are involved in the prosecution, and not as

10

to collateral matters.

Isn't that your point?

11

MR. LONG:

Yes, Your Honor.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The --

Those are the only norms

13

that are relevant, what norms oblige counsel to advise a

14

defendant regarding trial matters.

15

MR. LONG:

Correct.

And under Strickland --

16

under the Sixth Amendment, criminal defense attorneys

17

must focus on issues of guilt and innocence and penalty.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18

Well, everyone at the

19

counsel table I assume agrees that the plea has to be

20

voluntary.

21

Number one, it is not coerced or forced.

22

your argument that “voluntary” does not include being

23

fully informed?

24
25

But “voluntary” has various meanings:

MR. LONG:

Would -- isn't

Well then, about important

3

collateral consequences.

Is there -- are there any

4

cases that address this point one way or the other?

5

That is to say, the extent to which “voluntary” includes

6

the component of being informed about major

7

consequences, significant consequences of the plea?

8

I go anywhere to -- to read a discussion of this?

Can

12

Brady, and they uniformly come up with the -- with the

conclusion that no affirmative duty is required.

then jump from that position to the -- to a position

where misadvice somehow changes the inquiry.

to focus again on “voluntary,” where -- meaning full

5

based on ineffective assistance of counsel.

6

staring the Court in the face was this direct versus

8

It didn't consider it relevant to its determination.

4

(Laughter.)

5

-- on immigration law.

And in reliance on

6

that faulty advice, the defendant pleads guilty and finds

7

himself facing removal.

8
9

MR. LONG:

Well, following the logic of this

-- of the circuits and of this Court's guidance in

10

Brady, again, the inquiry for voluntariness is on direct

11

consequences, so it would not rise to a Sixth Amendment

12

claim.

13

Counsel may, nonetheless, be -- I'm not a

14

very -- I’m not a very good counsel in that situation.

15

However, as it was pointed out earlier, sometimes,

16

criminal defendants risk ordinary error with their

17

representation, and in fact, this Court has recognized

18

that in numerous cases.

19

In U.S. v. Ruiz, this Court kind of compiled

20

a group of cases, including Brady, McMann, and Tollett,

21

in which the defendant did, in fact, operate under

22

misapprehensions with regard to things that we most

23

often consider strategic, more direct obligations of the

24

trial.

25

They -- I think it was in Brady -- they

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

misapprehended the quality of the evidence and the

2

penalties and such, and this Court ultimately found

3

that, in all those cases, there is a certain amount of

4

ordinary error that is risked when pleading guilty, that

5

you risk a certain amount -- that your counsel may not

6

have made the best strategic decision.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask this

8

question:

Supposing this wasn't a drug crime -- a

9

sexual abuse of a minor, which would lead to all sorts

10

of restrictions on where the defendant could live and

11

report to as a resident, and the like, would there be –-

12

would that be a collateral consequence or a direct

13

consequence, in the advice on that?
MR. LONG:

14

I believe, Your Honor, that it

15

would be a -- a fine line, that it would technically be

16

a collateral consequence under the classic definition of

17

collateral consequence, that being whether or not it

18

falls under the control or discretion of the sentencing

19

court.

20

The -JUSTICE STEVENS:

Even though the

21

consequence is a -- is something required by the law of

22

the jurisdiction imposing the criminal penalty, it would

23

still be collateral?

24
25

MR. LONG:

The popular definition -- or the

most common definition focuses on whether it falls under

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

the discretion or power of the sentencing court.
In those jurisdictions that have sexual

3

offender registries, it is not a -- something that is

4

discretionary with the court.

5

executive agency that that is enforced, just like

6

parole, also just like your right -- to lose your right

7

to vote -- losing your right to bear arms.

8
9

It is through the

All of those things happen automatically by
action of law, yet they remain collateral because they

10

do not fall under -- with -- under the discretion and

11

power of the sentencing court.

12

If I could remind you all -- I apologize for

13

putting "you all" -- but -- my being from Kentucky is

14

showing a little.

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. LONG:

The modern rules of professional

17

conduct are very, very broad, and there's -- I don't

18

believe that it can be demonstrated that they were

19

actually violated here, even under the alleged conduct.

20

The prevailing norms that the ABA puts forth in its

21

brief or the criminal justice standards are

22

aspirational.

23

They -- they focus more on what --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought you told

24

Justice Breyer that any good lawyer would give this

25

advice to a client?

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. LONG:

I said -- in response to Justice

2

Breyer, in the extreme circumstances, again, it would be

3

my opinion -- not necessarily the opinion of this Court

4

or necessarily it would fall under the Sixth Amendment,

5

but that, if you absolutely knew and that a -- a severe

6

collateral consequence is of great importance, you

7

should explore it.

8
9

The misadvice rule that the U.S. government
kind of puts forth as the hybrid position does -- I

10

do believe creates these collateral consequences as land

11

mines to be avoided.

12

I think it does, in fact, encourage criminal

13

defendants to be -- or criminal defense attorneys to be

14

silent in situations where they would otherwise be

15

more free in offering that advice.

16

And, again, offering the advice does not

17

necessarily raise it to Sixth Amendment purview because,

18

again, there are any number of things that are going to

19

come up in that attorney-client relationship.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We are talking on a

21

highly general level, but what's facing us -- this case,

22

is there are certain crimes -- an increased number of

23

crimes that are classified as aggravated felonies, where

24

the rule is, if you are convicted of an aggravated

25

felony, you are out of the country after you serve your

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

time.

2

There’s nothing mysterious about that.

3

There’s nothing intricate about making that

4

determination.

5

an alien have an obligation, when there is an aggravated

6

felony as the charge, to say this will be the

7

consequence?

8
9

So why wouldn't a lawyer whose client is

MR. LONG:

Well, I think, in this case, we

are focusing on the obligation created by the Sixth

10

Amendment, and the Sixth Amendment obligation refers to

11

the criminal proceeding and the criminal prosecution and

12

then to aid in the defense.

13

Like the -- and we would agree with the

14

Solicitor General there, that the purpose for the

15

criminal attorney in that situation is to counteract the

16

expert of the Commonwealth or the State, is to ensure

17

the fair and just determination of guilt, not to advise

18

on collateral matters such as deportation, child

19

custody, and the like.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

You keep insisting on the

21

collateral, although you recognized that in Hill v.

22

Lockhart, the Court did not draw that line.
MR. LONG:

23

Well, ultimately -- and this

24

Court did not -- didn't draw any line.

25

that point.

It was silent on

And given the -- the way the lower courts

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

have reacted in drawing the direct and collateral line,

2

I think that's kind of where we have to go.
That’s what the rule is of the lower courts

3
4

and it’s the rule that has -- has been applied

5

throughout the nation, and we are testing whether or not

6

that rule makes sense, essentially.

7

And I think, ultimately, there is a

8

potential problem in treating deportation differently

9

than other collateral consequences.

To do so –- I

10

believe, at one point in Mr. Kinnaird's argument, he

11

does make the point that deportation, because it is of

12

such importance or that -- that it should be treated

13

differently.

14

But that is to suggest that it's so

15

important in all situations and it is more important

16

than collateral consequence that may affect citizens.

17

Citizens will lose the right to vote.

18

their right to jury service, perhaps lose custody of

19

their children.

20

They will lose

And there’s no principled reason to really

21

treat deportation differently.

22

it differently because it is viewed as so severe, it's

23

truly then a subjective inquiry as what collateral

24

consequence is severe to this client.

25

If the reason to treat

And it ultimately prefers a class of

49
Alderson Reporting Company

1

citizens -- those who are non-citizens -- over citizens

2

who may have just as much importance placed on

3

collateral consequences they face.

4

Moving real quickly, if I could just touch

5

briefly on the prejudice prong of Strickland.

6

I'm not -- well, I hesitate to say this a little bit,

7

but it's not completely apparent on the record that

8

counsel's performance was, in fact, deficient.

9

First,

He did not misadvise with regard to any

10

direct consequence.

11

misunderstood any of the rights he was waiving, and at

12

least -- and up until his reply brief, he made no bones

13

about the fact that he was guilty.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

MR. KINNAIRD:

Thank you, Your Honor.

6

Three quick points.

In Hill, the Court did

7

expressly hold that Strickland applies to the collateral

8

consequence of parole eligibility, so it is not just

9

for -- for trial consequences.

10

And, secondly, Brady is predicated on an

11

assumption that there is competent advice on the

12

strategic decisions --

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excue me, I'm not sure that

14

parole eligibility could qualify as a collateral

15

consequence.

16

MR. KINNAIRD:

It certainly would under the

17

-- Kentucky’s test, Your Honor, because it depends on

18

such factors as the actual sentence, the prior

19

convictions of the defendant.

20

are known at the plea colloquy --

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Those are not things that

It goes to the sentence.

22

It goes to what the sentence will be, which is certainly

23

part of the trial.

24
25

MR. KINNAIRD:

Well, under Rule 11, at least

prior to the abolition of parole, there was no

51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

advisement in the district courts -- the Federal

2

district courts on that.
The second point is that it is predicated on

3
4

competency, and so the standard is not voluntariness.

5

When you are in the Sixth Amendment, you go to the

6

Strickland standard of incompetency, and then prejudice

7

within the criminal prosecution.

8

is what we have here, the forfeiture of a jury trial

9

right.

And I emphasize that

We are not talking about prejudice outside the

criminal prosecution.
And, finally, while we agree with the
