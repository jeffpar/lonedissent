CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

4

argument first this morning in Case 08-876, Conrad Black

5

et al. v. The United States.

6

Mr. Estrada.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. ESTRADA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

For two decades, courts of appeals

12

confronting Section 1346 have been unanimous on, at

13

most, three points.

14

The first one is that the unvarnished text

15

of the statute is vague, amorphous, open-ended, and

16

essentially, not very helpful.

17

The second one is that a meaningful attempt

18

to construe the statute can take place, if at all, only

19

in light of a body of law that this Court rejected in

20

McNally and Congress likely intended to restore in the

21

act.

22

And the third is that this exercise is

23

fraught with due process and federalism problems and

24

risks the creation of common law crimes, especially in

25

the private sector where the pre-McNally precedent was
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

not well-developed.

2

The principal question in this case is

3

whether a prosecution may be sustained under a 1346

4

theory, under a theory that was not successful before

5

McNally and, in fact, had been affirmatively rejected,

6

even in the heyday of the intangible rights doctrine.

7

Because the answer to that question is "no," all

8

convictions in this case must be reversed.

9

It would be well to start by acknowledging

10

that the root difficulty in this case is that this Court

11

asked Congress to speak clearly, and Congress did not do

12

that.

13

As a result, there is no solution that is

14

really capable of providing an -- an elegant out to the

15

morass that the lower courts have been confronting, but

16

the choices, essentially, fall on three categories.

17

And the first is to return the matter to

18

Congress, either because the statute is vague in all of

19

its applications, both public or private, or as to

20

private conduct, because there are not enough guideposts

21

for judicial decision-making to give meaning to the

22

statute.

23

The second category of choices -

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

You -- you don't ask for

the first, do you?
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. ESTRADA:

Yes, we do.

I mean, we -- we

2

have -- we have written a question that necessarily has

3

that as a predicate, which, under this Court's cases,

4

leave that predicate open to the Court.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We have an -

Are -- are you saying that

6

unless we adopt the limiting instruction that you

7

propose, the statute is then vague?

8

MR. ESTRADA:

9

We have argued that.

It is

also -- you know, just to -- just to finish painting the

10

picture, Justice Kennedy, we have -- we have the trunk

11

of a tree, and that's -- you know, the statute, is it

12

vague or isn't?

13

Then we have the question of whether there

14

is a limiting construction, and Professor Altshuler, for

15

example, has made a case that limiting the statute to

16

bribes and kickbacks is a possibility, as that being,

17

arguably, the only core conduct that Congress could have

18

contemplated.

19

And -- and the third one is to go beyond

20

bribes and -- and kickbacks, and to expand the statute

21

to what Congress likes to call self-dealing or

22

non-disclosure, which is really a wholesale takeover of

23

State commercial law.

24
25

In our view, if the Court is disposed to
reach that far into the third category, it is essential
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that the restrictions that had been recognized before

2

McNally be enforced against -- against the government,

3

but we have briefed the case in the way we have to

4

this -- basically assuming that this tree is not

5

imaginary and actually exists -

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your theory -- your

7

theory that return to the pre-McNally cases would help

8

you is based almost entirely on the D.C. Circuit case -

9

case in Lemire -- Lemire.

10

MR. ESTRADA:

I think that is not a fair

11

statement, Mr. Chief Justice.

12

Circuit's opinion, of course, is indeed very helpful,

13

but it was a -- a distillation of what other courts of

14

appeals have told the government again and again, in

15

Ballard in the Fifth Circuit, in Feldman in the Seventh,

16

in -

17
18

I think the D.C.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The -- the

government tells us it was an outlier.

19

MR. ESTRADA:

Well, it had a different view,

20

as we have pointed out, when they filed the brief in the

21

Carpenter case.

22

isn't can be judged by what the contemporaneous cases

23

were.

24
25

But the fact is, whether it is or it

And Von Barta, Dixon, all cases in the
Second Circuit, Feldman in the Seventh, Ballard, all had
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

indicated that this was a requirement of the theory in

2

intangible rights cases.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, since the -- since the

4

body of pre-McNally lower court cases was hardly

5

completely consistent, do you think this is a workable

6

approach?

7

MR. ESTRADA:

The honest answer is:

I do

8

believe that the statute is vague in all of its -- all

9

of its applications, and I am happy to explain, quickly,

10
11

because of that, why that is.
Obviously, there are obvious problems of

12

notice with the statute.

13

with the statute, as if the notice problems were not

14

enough, is in the second prong of the vagueness

15

doctrine, which is the conferral of discretion to select

16

the defendant on the government, and in particular, the

17

prosecutors.

18

was outlined by Justice Breyer's concurring opinion in

19

the Morales case.

20

The more fundamental problem

And this is a situation not unlike that as

And what he pointed out, pointing to cases

21

like Coates v. City of Cincinnati, was that a statute

22

that essentially confers discretion on the -- on the

23

police and the prosecutors to select the quarry and come

24

up with that appropriate justification to sell to the

25

Court later 7

4

trunk.

5

Let's take just the limiting principle of the

Whether it's in the private or the public

6

sector, why would, offering, there be any discretion or

7

any sense of vagueness about saying:

8

give a bribery?

9
10

MR. ESTRADA:

It's illegal to

I -

JUDGE SOTOMAYOR:

To get a contract, to pass

11

legislation, it's illegal to take a kickback.

12

nothing seemingly vague about that or seemingly

13

troublesome about prosecutorial discretion in those -

14

at least those two situations.

15

self-dealing question.

16

MR. ESTRADA:

There is

We could then go to the

I absolutely agree with the

17

statements that you made, Justice Sotomayor.

It is

18

undoubtedly true that a -- that a statute that

19

proscribes bribery or kickbacks can constitutionally be

20

written, if that is what the statute says.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22

not within your test, as I understand it.

23

there has to be economic harm to the person owed the

24

duty of loyalty.

25

But it's not your -- it's
Your test is,

Now, you could have a bribe or a kickback
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that will line the pockets of the person who takes it,

2

doesn't deceive the person who is giving it, and doesn't

3

harm the company to whom a duty of loyalty is owed.

4

So it seems to me that the bribe and

5

kickback, which I think is heartland McNally, would not

6

be included in yours.

7

or contemplated, to the person owed the duty of loyalty.

8

It must be economic harm, actual

MR. ESTRADA:

I think that is not a fair

9

statement, Justice Ginsburg, because in our economic

10

system, I think it is fairly inferable, and any jury

11

could so find that if you are a supply agent for a

12

corporation and you are taking a bribe of $10,000 to

13

steer the contract to Company X, Company X would be more

14

than happy, and it would be a matter of indifference to

15

Company X to just give a 10K break to your employer.

16

So it is inherent in the economic system in

17

the private sector that if you're talking about bribes

18

and kickbacks, there is an obvious, though perhaps not

19

fully quantifiable, risk of loss to the person to whom

20

the duty is owed.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The problem with the bribe

22

or kickback explanation, unlike -- or you contend,

23

unlike yours, is that there's no basis in the statute

24

for limiting it to that.

25

MR. ESTRADA:

I think, Justice Scalia 9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, we -- we can't find

2

a statute that says, "No person shall commit a bad act."

3

We can't find that to be non-vague as applied to murder.

4

Everybody knows that murder is a bad act.

5

would that law be constitutional?

6

MR. ESTRADA:

Would that -

No, and that was going to be

7

the second part of my answer to Justice Sotomayor, and

8

it is a point that Justice Breyer also made in the

9

Morales case, taking -- taking the example of Coates v.

10

City of Cincinnati where the law basically said, "You

11

shall not engage in annoying conduct."

12

Now, as Justice Breyer pointed out, many of

13

us would agree 100 out of 100 that certain things are

14

definitely annoying.

15

for example, that an assault is annoying does not mean

16

that this statute gives notice that -- that, you know,

17

your conduct is -- is within its written terms -

18

And the fact that you could find,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Let's say you have a

19

bank that is going to be opening up a lot of branches in

20

the State, and one of the directors knows this and knows

21

where they are going to open them.

22

and buys up the real estate where the bank is going to

23

put its -- put its branch, so that he gets the benefit

24

of the -- of the sale.

25

-- that he's going to charge is a fair market price, no

And he goes around

And assume that the price that

10
Alderson Reporting Company

3
4

different than what anybody else would charge.
Now, is that sort of self-dealing covered
under your view of the statute?
MR. ESTRADA:

Well, I think that sort of

5

self-dealing likely would be covered, not under my view

6

of the statute, but under Carpenter, because if you were

7

stealing confidential information from your employer,

8

and the Court in Carpenter did say that confidential

9

information is a -- is a form of property as a matter of

10
11

Federal law CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But he is not

12

stealing -- he is not stealing the confidential

13

information.

14

to know the confidential information.

15

As the director, he has the perfect right

MR. ESTRADA:

But under either view, if you

16

are going to steal the corporate opportunity, that, too,

17

is a form of property, and in fact, the property counts

18

in this very -

Well, I don't know

that I would call it a corporate -- I don't know if I

21

would call it a corporate opportunity.

looking to sell the land; they need to buy it.

23

MR. ESTRADA:

They are not

Precisely, but -- but this is

24

not unlike cases like O'Hagan, or even Carpenter itself,

25

in which, you know, the value of the use of the
11

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

information comes from learning the confidential plans

2

of your employer.

3

said that the information itself could be a form of

4

intangible property.

5

And in those circumstances, Carpenter

native duty violation, which is what we are dealing

here.

mean, under the -- under the kickback -

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

MR. ESTRADA:

Kickback or bribe.

No, it couldn't.

I mean, part

20

of the point I was going to make is that under any of

21

these choices, whether the statute is vague or

22

unapplicable to private conduct, choice one, or whether

23

it is a kickback or bribe, choice two, there would not

24

be a case to send to the jury for the defendants in this

25

case.
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

The only argument comes up if you really

2

want to climb to the thinnest reed of the thinnest

3

branch and say that it could extend to naked

4

non-disclosure of confidential information or use of

5

confidential information in violation of a duty imposed

6

by contract or State law, or maybe even a consent

7

decree, as in Sorich.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Estrada, let -- let me

pursue the notion I -- I floated earlier, that the

10

problem with Professor Altshuler's approach is that

11

there is nothing in the text of the statute that would

12

enable you to limit it to kickbacks and -- and bribes.

13

Is there anything in the text of the statute that makes

14

your proposal any better?

15

I mean, to be sure, it does -- it does make

16

this a kind of fraud, and in the past, fraud did require

17

injury to somebody.

18

namely, fraud that consists of the deprivation of honest

19

services.

20

under the text of the statute, I take to be the fraud.

21

But it defined a new kind of fraud,

That's the fraud.

MR. ESTRADA:

That, in and of itself,

Your Honor, I don't think that

22

I can give an answer that would be fully satisfactory to

23

a pure textualist, that this can be taken out of the

24

words of the statute.

25

As a practical matter, however, if you
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

consider the legislative record, and the avowing hint to

2

restore some part of what McNally had thrown out, then a

3

harder question comes up, and the issue of what that was

4

actually becomes highly relevant.

5

that, even under the textualist view, it is fair to say

6

that Congress went in the private sector from a view of

7

fraud that is -- that was classically property kind to a

8

view of fraud that has nothing to do with property.

9

But I do not think

And the reason for that takes understanding

10

what -- what the problem really was that Congress was

11

trying to fix, and that the intangible rights cases were

12

trying to fix.

13

And it's really one of symmetry.

It has always been the case that mail fraud

14

is a specific intent crime.

15

case, and this is clearly stated in cases like Regent

16

Office Supply and Dixon, from Judge Friendly, that a

17

part of the specific intent to defraud is an intent to

18

harm.

19

harm the victim by obtaining, in a corrupt manner, his

20

property.

21

intended harm to the victim and the expected gain of the

22

defendant, because the gain comes from the victim's

23

pocket.

24
25

And it has always been the

Now, in classic fraud, the defendant intends to

So there is a perfect symmetry between the

The problem of bribes and kickbacks that the
intangible rights cases were trying to deal with is not
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that they were trying to dispense with the harm's

2

requirement to the victim; they were trying to deal with

3

the lack of symmetry where the person given the payoff

4

is not deceived and the harm to the victim is

5

non-quantifiable.

6

say that this statute could then say that the term of

7

art, as the government calls it, that Congress used was

8

intended to cover that situation.

9

And to fix that problem, you could

Now, the proof in the pudding on that comes

10

from a very well-known case.

Let's take, you know, the

11

Holzer case, which was cited extensively by Justice

12

Stevens in his dissent in McNally.

13

was a State court judge who had been taking bribes, and

14

his conviction was affirmed in an opinion by Judge

15

Posner, which he cited in this case again, which

16

appears, I think, at 816 F.2d, and it was just a

17

straight intangible rights affirmment.

18

you know, Judge Holzer did, and he got a GVR in light of

19

McNally.

You may recall it

He sought cert,

And Judge Posner got the case back.

20

Judge Holzer goes back and there is a second

21

opinion, 840 F.2d, and Judge Posner has to conclude that

22

Judge Holzer has to be let go on the mail fraud counts.

23

And the reason he gives is:

24

got lots of money, but he didn't get the money from

25

anybody who was deceived, and all of his victims, which

Look, the judge obviously

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

were the public and the litigants against whom the cases

2

were fixed, those people didn't lose any money, so that

3

under the McNally paradigm, because the money that Judge

4

Holzer got in bribes did not come from the victims, that

5

-- that judge had to be let go.

6
7

And I think that that's part of what
Congress clearly had in mind as was trying to fix.

8
9

Now, I agree with your -- with your apparent
antecedent view and what I call issue one in the case,

10

that the way that Congress did it has been one of not

11

complying with the request that this Court made.

12

not make anything clear in a way that sets forth in the

13

text what it does.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It did

Well, but

15

presumably, the one thing it's odd to suggest Congress

16

did was sort of run 1346 through 1341, when what it was

17

trying to fix was the Court's understanding of what 1341

18

provided.

19

MR. ESTRADA:

There are any -- there are any

20

number of problems with how Congress chose to do this,

21

Mr. Chief Justice.

22

iceberg, because if you look as a textual matter to the

23

first words of Section 1346, you will see that this new

24

amended definition of "scheme to defraud" applies to all

25

of the offenses in Chapter 63 of Title 18.

That is actually the tip of the

16
Alderson Reporting Company

There are 11

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of those.

2

And in addition to mail and wire fraud, at

3

least three of them -- bank fraud, securities fraud, and

4

healthcare fraud -- used the phrase "scheme to defraud."

5

And unless you are prepared to try to save the statute

6

by -- by trying to identify a core of what Congress was

7

trying to do that is squarely anchored in the

8

pre-McNally law, which may or may not be a successful

9

enterprise, you do not have any textual guidance that

10

will tell you whether this theory that the government

11

likes to state at a very high level of generality would

12

not become a deus ex machina in a number of other

13

statutes that we have yet to -- to hear from.

14

is -

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that

What if -- what if I think

16

that even -- I mean, much of your case is directed to

17

the point that you -- you have to narrow it this way to

18

avoid constitutional problems.

19

What if I think you don't avoid

20

constitutional problems?

21

MR. ESTRADA:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Then it Why should -- why should I

23

turn somersaults to -- to come out with the -- with the

24

interpretation that you want?

25

MR. ESTRADA:

You should not.
17

Alderson Reporting Company

And in that

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

event, we fully support -- actually, we support anyway

2

-- the -- the brief that was filed by the Chamber of

3

Commerce and the National Association of Criminal

4

Defense Lawyers, for the proposition that as an

5

essential matter, this statute cannot be saved.

6

I am merely pointing out, Justice Scalia,

7

that for somebody who is not a textualist, that question

8

may not be as clear-cut.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Where -- where in

10

the record do we find your argument that the statute is

11

unconstitutional?

12

MR. ESTRADA:

We made it -- we made it in

13

the district court in a motion to dismiss the

14

indictment, and I don't believe that is part of the

15

joint appendix, but it is Docket Entry 261.

16

And in that same motion, we argued that this

17

statute, if it were to be applied at all, had to be

18

interpreted solely as a matter of Federal law, which

19

oddly enough, is the position that the government has

20

finally now taken in the Weyhrauch case.

21

based on the Jerome case and Cleveland case, which are

22

the cases that the government has finally discovered.

23

And we argued

We argued again in the court of appeals, and

24

we argued expressly that although the Seventh Circuit

25

had -- had previously indicated that it would uphold the
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

constitutionality of the statute against a vagueness

2

challenge, that Judge Easterbrook, writing for the court

3

in Thompson, had left open the possibility that they may

4

yet find a case in which that would be revisited.

5

we expressly argued that this was the case for which

6

Thompson had left the -- the question open.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

And

Now, what about Under the test that you

propose, is the test the same?

Does the statute read

10

the same way, and is the test the same for private and

11

public officials?

12

MR. ESTRADA:

No.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No.
Well, then we -- then if

14

we accept your view, we have to have one subset of

15

definitions for private officials and another for public

It's hard to do that under the statute.
MR. ESTRADA:

That is a problem that is

18

inherent, as I said earlier, in trying to do anything to

19

save the statute.

20

But let me say -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, under the judge's

21

bribery case that we just -- that you discussed earlier,

22

couldn't you take the position that that money the judge

23

took as a bribe really should have been paid to the

24

government?

25

MR. ESTRADA:

Well, oddly enough, that was

2

the Holzer case, and Judge Posner said, Well, that is

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But that would fit your

test, though.

6

MR. ESTRADA:

Well, yes, in a -- in a very

7

formal way.

But -- but if I could say just one word on

8

the question of the public v. Private distinction,

9

Justice Kennedy, because I think it is important, in

10

trying to figure out how one goes about trying to fix

11

what is basically a mess, you have to keep in mind that

12

the courts had accepted the intangible rights theory

13

before McNally, and which Congress presumably and -- or

14

likely was trying to bring back, had -- had not taken

15

the view that they were doing something other than

16

fraud.

17

But they have taken the view that there was

18

a basis in the concept of fraud for distinguishing

19

between the public and the private, even before McNally.

20

And some of this -- this is found in the briefing in

21

McNally and is set forth in Justice Stevens's dissenting

22

opinion, that there was this other statute, Section 371

23

of 18 U.S.C., the conspiracy statute, that uses the

24

phrase "conspiracy to defraud the United States."

25

And on the basis of that statute, before
20

McNally, the courts of appeals have -- have ruled that

2

an intent to interfere with the property rights of the

3

government was not an element of the core meaning of the

4

fraud.

5

a case called Hask v. Henfold, and followed later by a

6

case called Hammerschmidt, this Court had said that in

7

order to be convicted of defrauding the government under

this other statute, no need -- there was no need to show

MR. ESTRADA:

We -- we raised that as a

predicate for our question presented.

And we said this

is vague, but -- but if -- but if you do not accept this

17

proposed restriction that has been accepted by the -- by

18

the courts of appeals, then you would really have to

19

take the -- take the step of actually striking it down.

20

If you are asking whether we tendered it as

a separate question presented, the answer to that is no,

22

Mr. Chief Justice, but under this Court's cases that is

23

not needed.

the particular type of warrant, an anticipatory search

5

warrant, was categorically improper under the Fourth

Amendment.

7

was an antecedent question that was a predicate for a

logical disposition of the actual question in front of

And -- because, as the court explained, it

In doing that -- that, by the way, was a
unanimous opinion by Justice Scalia.
In doing that, you know, the Court cited to

unanimous opinion, this time by Justice Kennedy.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

5

MR. DREEBEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

6

The Petitioner today has sought to present a

question to this Court that he chose not to include in

8

his questions presented, whether the statute is

9

unconstitutionally vague in all of its applications.

10

What he did present in his question

11

presented to this Court is whether there is an element

12

of contemplated economic harm inherent in the concept of

13

fraud in Section 1341, so that any honest services

14

prosecution must show contemplated or foreseeable

15

economic harm in order to be sustained.

granting relief to a Petitioner who chose not to raise

6

the constitutional issue in this Court -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, it's a little -

it's a little odd that you -- you would say that an

9

argument that shows a way the statute can be saved

10

cannot be -- cannot be presented.

11

MR. DREEBEN:

Well -

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean, he's saying the

13

statute could be saved, if at all, if you adopt this -

14

this construction.

15

must be set aside.

16

And if you do, his -- his conviction

MR. DREEBEN:

I think that the Court should

17

reach that issue, the issue whether there is

18

contemplated economic harm as a requirement for the

19

statute, and the government briefed that issue, and I

20

disagree with Petitioner that contemplated economic harm

21

is either an element of the statute or necessary to save

22

its constitutionality.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, on the other hand,

for it, then that's because the statute's there.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, Mr. Dreeben,

MR. DREEBEN:

13

let me outline -

16

And I think that it should, because -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, just -- just so we -

It is not the

He doesn't say that.

He says that if we adopt his interpretation,

22

we can avoid reaching the constitutional question,

23

because whether it's constitutional or not, it at least

24

requires the -- the kind of financial harm that -- that

25

he asserts.

So he is not asserting that if we -- if we
28

accept his position, the statute is constitutional.

2

don't read his brief as saying that, anyway.

3

MR. DREEBEN:

I

That's probably a fair

4

characterization of language in his brief, but it does

5

bear note that he never asked this Court to decide that

6

question.

7

Now, the question that is before the Court,

8

and I think it will illuminate the vagueness concerns

9

that are on the Justice's minds, is:

What does the

10

statute mean?

11

to recognize that when this Court held in McNally that

12

the mail fraud statute did not protect intangible

13

rights, Congress came back in response to this Court's

14

invitation and said:

intangible right of honest services which had assumed

Yes, it does; it protects the

description of the lower courts as massively confused is

22

not correct.

It's not a fair description of the cases.

6

loyalties of an agent or a fiduciary.

7

They refer to the right of honest services,

exaggerating, possibly, but I think every agent has a

duty of loyalty to provide loyal and honest services to

Every worker is an agent of

abstract sense, should have told their employer that,

7

"My niece is going to get $10 million if we go ahead

8

with this contract"?

9
10

MR. DREEBEN:

Let me make two points in

response to that, Mr. Chief Justice.

11

The obligation under 1346 is a Federal

12

obligation.

Congress, by reinstating this body of law,

13

by virtue of 1346, created a Federal obligation that is

14

not dependent on State law.

15

this more in the Weyhrauch case, where that issue is

16

specifically presented, but it should not be understood

17

as a State law obligation.

Second, the core -

source -- and I think that's inherent in the Chief

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Excuse me, may I ask you

to put -- in terms of your brief, you said your

definition of materiality -- you said materiality is

related to but different from what Mr. Estrada is urging

the Court to adopt:

14

can you tell us how materiality is related to economic

15

harm to the victim and how it is different from economic

harm to the victim?

17

economic harm to the victim.

MR. DREEBEN:

So

It is related to it, Justice

18

Ginsburg, in that in a business setting materiality will

19

be in most cases coextensive with economic harm at least

20

if economic harm is conceived as I conceive it, and as

4

There was a very substantial body

And those cases, I think, as Mr. -- the

Chief Justice indicated earlier, contained, but a single

somehow, into the notion of an intent to defraud that he

says was inherent in the mail fraud statute everywhere

then he would have to say that a -- an intangible rights

foresee economic harm in any intangible rights case,

Relatedly, I would like to add, because the

government said that count seven was a theft, that the

16

And if that's what the jury was told, you
cannot really say that count seven is separate.

turned on whether the transactions at issue were, quote,

20

And the jury was further told -

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

services include fiduciary duties under corporate.
