ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. LONG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In this ERISA case, the court of appeals

12

applied a deferential standard of review to the

13

district court's interpretation of the Xerox plan, but

14

not to the plan administrator's interpretation.

15

think the court of appeals got it backwards.

16

We

Under either a deferential standard of

17

review or a de novo standard, the plan administrator's

18

interpretation should prevail.

19

unlike the district court's interpretation, is

20

grounded in the language of the plan.

21

the fundamental actuarial principle of the time value

22

of money, and it avoids conferring windfalls.

That interpretation,

It recognizes

23

In Firestone and Glenn, this Court looked to

24

the language of the plan, which reflects the intent of

25

the plan's sponsor.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

But -- but when the

2

administrator has interpreted the plan incorrectly and

3

the court finds -- the court of appeals finds that he

4

has interpreted it incorrectly, it doesn't have to

5

send it back and say, you know:

6

try something else.

7

and we find that what you should have done is this.

It says:

Give me another bid;
You did it incorrectly,

8

Isn't that what normally happens?

9

MR. LONG:

Well, we think under trust law,

10

which the Court has looked to in Glenn and Firestone,

11

where the plan of the settlor of the trust has

12

assigned the responsibility for making the

13

discretionary determinations to the plan administrator

14

or to the trustee, unless there's been a showing of

15

bad faith or some other reason to think that the

16

discretion will not be exercised honestly and fairly,

17

it -- it is really up to the plan administrator to

18

make that discretionary determination.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So all a court can do in

20

those trust cases is to say:

21

Sam; go back and do it again.

22

MR. LONG:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You've got it wrong,
Right?

Well -And he gets it wrong again,

24

and he goes back to court; the court says:

25

still wrong; go back and do it again.

Sam, it's

MR. LONG:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

Well, we -I can't believe that that's

what the law is.

4

MR. LONG:

We think these situations of

5

the -- of the multiple bites at the apple will be

6

rare.

7

that has not been a problem --

Trust law has had this rule for decades, and

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:
isn't trust law.

Well, the SG says that

The SG says that trust law -- when

10

you make a mistake and you send it back, that the

11

district judge has a choice here, which would make

12

sense.

13

get something out of the trust -- the administrator,

14

listens to him.

The district judge, if he thinks he’s going to

I mean, it sounds like common sense would

15
16

be:

Listen to the administrator, but you don't have

17

to do it.

18

MR. LONG:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20
21

complicated.

Well, I --

He may understand it.

MR. LONG:

I'd -- I'd have a two-part

22

answer, Justice Breyer --

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24
25

Because it's very

So, is she wrong?

You’re

saying if I look at those cases, I’ll find -MR. LONG:

Well, I think, first, it would

5
Alderson Reporting Company

1

be -- it would be quite unusual to say the standard of

2

review is up to the court, that it can be either -JUSTICE BREYER:

3

It's not -- it's not a

4

standard of review.

5

what the word "duplicative" means, okay?

6

and the administrator did his best.

7

what it meant before, which is, like, 14 pages of

8

who-could-understand-it.

9

It's -- he's trying to figure out

MR. LONG:

10

And the --

He says it means

Okay.

Well -- well, but --

JUSTICE BREYER:

And then it turns out that

11

that isn't what it means, and the district judge says:

12

That's affirmed.

13

shot.

14

So now he says:

Give me another

If it were me, I’d listen, but if I thought

15

this isn't really that great, I would try to figure

16

out something else.

17

appeals judge, I’d say it's up to the district court.

And then if I were a court of

MR. LONG:

JUSTICE BREYER:

But -Now, luckily, the SG says

that is the law.

22

MR. LONG:

Well, but Professor Scott, who

23

was the reporter for both the second and the first

24

Restatement --

Yes.

MR. LONG:

with the --

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. LONG:

Says it isn't the law.

The section numbers correlate

5

exactly with the sections of the Restatement for which

6

he was reporter.

7

treatise, which correlates with section 187 of the

8

Restatement Second, the principle is that unless

9

there's been bad faith or some other reason to expect

If you look in section 187 of his

10

that the trustee will not exercise the discretion

11

fairly and honestly -- I mean, there -- and there are

12

examples, illustrations 11 and 12.

13

amount is unreasonably low --

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

If -- if the

What about just that?

He

15

came back, the administrator, I think, the second

16

time, with something that very closely resembled the

17

first time.

18

MR. LONG:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

Well, I think it’s -And what about that for a

reason thinking he’s not in that good of faith?

21

Go ahead.

22

MR. LONG:

I think it’s quite different,

23

with -- with respect, Justice Breyer.

24

reconstructed account methodology really looked to the

25

performance of a hypothetical account, but the -- what

7
Alderson Reporting Company

The -- the

Official

1

we call the plan administrator's interpretation, the

2

interpretation that came up for the first time after

3

the Second Circuit, overruling the district court,

4

said, you know, this plan provision that clearly tells

5

you how to do it is actually invalid --

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

7

MR. LONG:

8

Well, if there’s no --

-- because it wasn't properly

disclosed.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

If there's no bad faith,

10

then how many shots does the plan administrator -- who

11

I don't think is named Sam -- gets to --

12

(Laughter.)

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

14

-- to try to answer this

question?
MR. LONG:

15

Well, we think the standard

16

is that if -- as long as there is discretion to be

17

exercised within the limits that would be set by the

18

court's opinion, absent a showing of bad faith or

19

other reason to think the discretion won't be

20

exercised honestly and fairly, it ought to be left to

21

the plan administrator, because that's what the plan

22

provides.

23

Now, I think --

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

Mr. Long, we’re talking

in the abstract --

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. LONG:

Yes.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- referring to Scott, but

3

-- that this case -- what I took away from the Second

4

Circuit's opinion was the flaw here was not that the

5

method was no good if you had adequate notice; the

6

flaw was the people affected were not told in what is

7

the language of ERISA, in plain, simple language, what

8

their entitlement was.

9

problem, not that this method wasn't perfectly

And that's -- that's the

10

satisfactory if you gave everybody notice.

11

Second Circuit said, you didn't give them notice.

12

Either it said nothing or it was totally ambiguous.

13

MR. LONG:

But the

Yes, and that's right at the

14

heart of the case, and you are quite correct.

The

15

Second Circuit did say there was not adequate notice

16

of the reconstructed account methodology, but it's an

17

important part of our submission that the plan

18

administrator's interpretation on remand is

19

significantly different.
This is the way these offsets are typically

20
21

done.

There’s nothing hypothetical about it.

You

22

take the lump sum that was actually paid to these plan

23

participants.

24

been purchased with that lump sum, using the annuity

25

rates that are put out by the Federal government, by

You look to the annuity that could have

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the PBGC.

2

This is the typical way this offset is

3

performed.

4

the chief actuaries have filed an amicus brief saying

5

this is quite typical, so this --

6

This is -- falls within the safe harbor,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if -- if there were

7

information, but the -- the ERISA provision says that

8

you are supposed to give the summary description of

9

the plan “in a manner calculated to be understood by

10

the average plan participant.”

11

MR. LONG:

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, yes.
And all that the 1989

13

statement said was the amount the employees received

14

may be reduced, if they previously left the company

15

and received a distribution at that time.

16

MR. LONG:

Yes.

And the -- and the Second

17

Circuit did not decide this question of whether the

18

notice of the plan administrator's interpretation was

19

sufficient, and -- but we think there are very strong

20

arguments that it -- that it was.

21

I mean, first of all, it did describe the

22

circumstances in which there could be an offset, which

23

is what the statute and the regulation requires.

24
25

And, second, it is the law in the Second
Circuit, as elsewhere, that in a summary plan

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

description -- which is just that, a summary -- you

2

need not describe in detail every offset and every

3

actuarial adjustment.

4

in ERISA plans.

5

small numbers of participants.

There are many such adjustments

They frequently apply to relatively

6

If it were a requirement of the statute that

7

each of these be described in detail in a summary plan

8

description, you would risk defeating the purpose of

9

the summary plan description and invalidating many

10
11

ERISA plans across the country.
So we would urge the Court, strongly, not to

12

accept this argument that, oh, well, you know, if

13

the -- if the notice of the reconstructed account

14

methodology is inadequate, then it must also be the

15

case that the notice of this different -- I would say

16

“plain vanilla” kind of offset -- typical offset, must

17

also be inadequate.

18

We don't think that is true --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, why -- this is

19

important to me, whether the plan administrator was

20

interpreting the same language when this case was

21

remanded back down.

22

applying the methodology that had been specified in

23

1990, right?

Originally, he was simply

24

MR. LONG:

Yes.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, Your Honor.
And the court said that was

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

no good because you didn't give these people notice of

2

it.

3

since 1990, but since 1980.

4

taken that to be a reasonable interpretation of the

5

very summary language in -- in the plan itself, right?

But that -- he had been applying that test not

6

MR. LONG:

7

at the time that --

8
9

In other words, he had

That is absolutely correct, and

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So when it went back, why

didn't he stick with that and say:

Yes, they didn't

10

have adequate notice of that, but that is still a

11

reasonable interpretation of the original plan, even

12

before we specified that.

13

MR. LONG:

When it went back on remand from

14

the Second Circuit the first time, the plan

15

administrator adopted a -- a new interpretation.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MR. LONG:

18
19

Yes.

That is what I'm calling the

“plain vanilla” -JUSTICE SCALIA:

I understand that.

Why did

20

he do that?

Inasmuch as the first interpretation was

21

not adopted in 1990, but it was adopted under the same

22

language that he is now interpreting in 1980, right?

23

He was applying it between 1980 and 1990.

24

he thought he -- that's what he thought the plan meant

25

in all those years.

12
Alderson Reporting Company

That's what

Official

1

MR. LONG:

Well -- and there was a provision

2

in the plan that specifically told him to do the

3

offset in this way, and the Second Circuit --

8

After 1990.

Well, no.

It was also in the

It --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, I didn't understand.

I

didn't understand it.

9

MR. LONG:

Yes.

A lot of this case started

10

because it got dropped out of the 1989 restatement, by

11

accident, for a period of 3 months, and all of these

12

dire consequences are really flowing from that.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, your -- your brief

14

says:

"The Plan Administrator has consistently

15

applied the reconstructed account methodology since

16

the early '80s."

17

MR. LONG:

Yes, that's correct.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

"Effective April '90"

19

-- "1990, the Plan language requiring this methodology

20

provided as follows."

21

was no such language before that?

So I took that to mean there

22

MR. LONG:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24

requiring it before 1990.

25

MR. LONG:

There -- there was.

Yes.

There was plan language

Yes.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. LONG:

Okay.

Yes, and that's another important

point in this complicated case.

4

period in which this -- what we call the reconstructed

5

account methodology that gave specific instructions

6

about how to do it, so we say it was not at all

7

unreasonable for the plan administrator to follow

8

those specific instructions.

9

I mean, the only

It dropped out in this 1989 restatement for

10

a very short period and then got put back in.

11

that's -- the Second Circuit said, well, then you get

12

into problems with anti-cutback and different types of

13

things, but --

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And

But where is it --

15

what -- what was in the summary plan description on

16

this point between 1980 and 1990, where is that?

17

MR. LONG:

There were a variety of summary

18

plan descriptions, obviously, and I think, in general,

19

Justice Ginsburg, they simply had the statement that

20

your benefit may be reduced, if you have received a

21

prior distribution.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Right.

So there was no

description of this in the summary plan description?
MR. LONG:

That's -- that is correct, during

that period, although, again --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

2

period?

3

-

So is it -- but what

Between 1980 and 1990 or the 3-month period ­

4

MR. LONG:

It was --

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

MR. LONG:

-- you’re talking about?

I think it was really in about

7

1995.

The descriptions got gradually more detailed,

8

as we go into the 1990s, but through the '80s and up

9

into the -- I think until about 1995 or so, there

10

would have been simply a statement that your benefit

11

may be reduced -JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

Okay.

That's -- that's

13

what I thought, and I thought you said no when I asked

14

that question, that this detailed description of the

15

RAM didn't come in until 1990.

16

MR. LONG:

Oh -- well, I'm sorry if I

17

misunderstood you, Justice Scalia.

I was talking

18

about the language of the plan, and we are, after all,

19

talking about benefits due under the terms of the

20

plan.

21

reconstructed account methodology, except for the

22

3-month period.

And the plan did include this specific

23

Now, the summary plan description had a --

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

MR. LONG:

Oh -- oh, I see.

-- had a much -- a much briefer

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

-- but, again --

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

MR. LONG:

I got you.

An additional point on this,

4

Justice Scalia, is -- I mean, this is a claim for

5

benefits due under the terms of the plan, and, you

6

know, there -- there’s actually a circuit split on

7

this.

8

summary plan description wasn't good enough; it didn't

9

contradict the plan, and it told me the circumstances

10

in which the benefits might be reduced, but it didn't

11

tell me how -- and, that's just not good enough.
Often, you have to make some sort of showing

12
13

But if the claim is something like, well, a

of reliance and prejudice, so it's really -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

But you seem to be

15

rearguing the -- I thought that the -- I thought that

16

you had surrendered on -- what is it called?

17

I.

18

had was no good, because it violated the notice

19

provision and it violated the anti-cutback provision.

20

So that's what they call a phantom --

That -- that the Second Circuit said:

21

MR. LONG:

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

23

MR. LONG:

24
25

Frommert

What you

Right.
-- account.

It's out.

They call it phantom accounting.

Right.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It’s out.

16
Alderson Reporting Company

But you seem

Official

1

to now be telling us that was really a wrong decision

2

on the Second Circuit's part, that there was -- that

3

it was perfectly good, that it was described in the

4

plan itself, although not in the summary plan

5

description.

6

MR. LONG:

Well -- well, no, and I -- I

7

mean, what happened is for the plaintiffs in this

8

case, they were hired after the -- rehired after the

9

1989 restatement went into effect, and so that's when

10

this -- when this provision that specifically

11

described the reconstructed account methodology was

12

dropped out, and that's when all the trouble started.

13

The only reason I was mentioning the

14

reconstructed account methodology was trying to

15

address Justice Scalia's question, although I may have

16

confused it further to say that the plan, the terms of

17

the plan, did include this specific provision, so it

18

was not crazy for the plan administrator to be

19

following that.

20

Now, it was struck down by the Second

21

Circuit, invalidated, and the plan administrator is

22

not seeking to challenge that on remand; obviously,

23

they can't.

24
25

But coming up with a

JUSTICE SCALIA:

--

So you claim -- you claim

that what he is interpreting when it comes back to him

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is not the same text that they invalidated --

2
3

MR. LONG:

It's the remaining

--

4
5

Absolutely.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- but rather it's the plan

without this text.

6

MR. LONG:

Absolutely.

It's the remaining

7

plan terms; there is a new interpretive question here,

8

which is:

9

terms, now that the Second Circuit -- unlike the plan

How do we make sense of the remaining plan

10

administrator, unlike the district court -- has held

11

that this provision that specifically addresses this

12

is invalid and can't be used.

13

new interpretive question that came up in litigation.
JUSTICE BREYER:

14

And that is really a

It's -- it struck me if --

15

it's hard.

16

the -- you had this original plan where, basically,

17

you were trying to figure out how much money they took

18

away, and you compared it with what it would have made

19

if you had invested it in certain funds.

20

have a new word, which is called "duplicative"; you

21

can't be duplicative, something like that.

22

I don't necessarily follow it at all, but

So now we

And then the Second Circuit says that new

23

word called “duplicative” for new plans doesn't really

24

pick up this old phantom system; at least, it doesn't

25

give notice.

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Now he sends it back, and the poor district

2

judge, since he thought that was perfectly sensible to

3

say it did pick that up, says:

4

didn't, so I’ll ask the administrator what do you

5

think we do now?

6

great idea; the plain vanilla system.

7

vanilla system happens to be very much like the old

8

system, except in following your own funds, you’re not

9

doing it; you’re following the -- the insurance

Well, I mean, just a couple of

points in response, Justice --

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. LONG:

Right.

I mean, first of all, it's not

22

just the word "duplication" or "non-duplication."

23

Section 9.6, which is on page 32a of the Joint

24

Appendix, says that if there has been a prior

25

distribution, the accrued benefit based on all the

19
Alderson Reporting Company

years of participation --

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MR. LONG:

Right.

-- shall be offset by the accrued

benefit attributable to such distribution.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

Correct, and the

question is:

8

the administrator comes back with a new system, which

9

new system is going to take the judgment of the

MR. LONG:

11

Well, no, Your Honor, the

12

judgment of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation

13

was what -­

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

And then what he's thinking is that's

16

awfully similar.

17

here --

18

All right, fine.

We just substituted different people

MR. LONG:

Well, but -- but, I mean, it's

19

similar in a sense that I think is clearly favorable

20

to the plan --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's similar in a sense,

22

and it's different in a sense.

23

MR. LONG:

I mean, if I could -- this is a

24

floor-offset plan, and the basic concept of the floor­

25

offset plan is to give a kind of an insurance policy,

20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that if the defined contribution plan performs poorly,

2

the defined benefit component of the plan will

3

guarantee that you get a certain minimum benefit.

4

so the way the thing works, if the defined

5

contribution balance is above the defined benefit,

6

then your defined contribution is your benefit.

7

that's good.

8
9

And

And

That means you have exceeded the floor.

And what happened here is -- this whole
thing -- we are calculating the defined benefit, the

10

floor.

That's what we are doing, and we are trying to

11

figure out what sort of offset do you take into

12

account because these people got lump sums; in some

13

cases quite, quite large.

14

Mr. Frommert got almost

So if -- the notion is, if Mr. Frommert had

15
16

continued working for Xerox throughout his career,

17

this money would have continued to grow; it would have

18

increased his defined contribution benefit; and he

19

would have not needed to use his insurance policy.
JUSTICE BREYER:

20

But the -- the more you

21

hypothetically grow it, the less chance they’ll get

22

the floor.

23

MR. LONG:

MR. LONG:

That's true.

And -- and it is a fundamental

principle of pensions, of ERISA, that there is a time

value of money.

whether this is a reasonable interpretation of the

terms of the plan, it is a question of law.

think it is unreasonable -- I mean, certainly, looking

at the plan language, there is plan language that does

speak to this, and then also, I mean, this --

So, that -- that's

what we’re talking about.

15

agrees with us that if you’re talking about the terms

16

of the plan, even if you’re trying to fashion a remedy

17

for a violation of ERISA, that is still a de novo

18

review question, and there would be terrible problems

19

with uniformity of plan interpretation if you said,

oh, well, you know, it's just a discretionary kind of

21

review; let's let every district court interpret this

22

plan in its own fashion.

23

The Solicitor General

says they have never in their entire careers, none of

Well, until the district court

6

said it was a reasonable interpretation of this plan.

And, in fact --

JUSTICE ALITO:

If this is not a

discretionary decision for the district court -- let's

10

assume it's not a discretionary decision for the --

11

for the administrator.

12

also not a discretionary decision for the district

13

court, if what the district court is required to do is

14

to say what the plan means, what would you suggest

15

that the district court should have looked to, when

16

the -- the provision, the -- the plan language that

17

the district court has to look at is very bare bones?

18

MR. LONG:

But if it's -- and if it's

Well, but you -- absolutely you

19

start with the language, and we don't think it is

20

quite that bare bones.

21

the offset is the accrued benefit attributable to the

22

prior distribution, and then section 1.1, which is the

23

definition of "accrued benefit," and that basically

24

says it is the normal retirement benefit payable at

25

normal retirement date at age 65 in an amount computed

The section 9.6, which says

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

in accordance with section 4.3.
And then 4.3 says the monthly benefit which

3

could be purchased with the member's transitional

4

retirement account -- that's the defined contribution

5

account -- as calculated using -- using annuity rates

6

established by the PBGC.

7

So it's not quite that bare-bones.

But then

8

we would also say -- you would look to this notion

9

that the time value of money is an absolutely central

10

concept to pensions, and the notion of people would

11

have use of money for 10 years or 20 years at a

12

zero interest rate -- and indeed, it's -- it's even

13

worse than that because, I mean, ultimately this has

14

to be expressed in the form of an annuity.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, Respondents say that

16

this was a -- sure, it's a -- a benefit to them to

17

be -- to have this offset only by the amount that they

18

received and not take into account the time value of

19

money, but this was an incentive that lured them into

20

accepting employment again with Xerox.

21

MR. LONG:

Well, with -- with respect,

22

Justice Alito, that is absolutely ridiculous.

23

no employer would do that to their current employees.

24

That would treat the current employees like suckers.

Thank you, Mr. Long.

MR. STRIS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
After hearing Mr. Long, I’d like to address
my remarks to two broad areas.
First, I’d like to talk about why the lower

11

courts in this case were not required to defer the

12

legal principle.

13

factual claims he has made, which are belied by the

14

record and directly contradict the findings of the

lower court in this case, I’d like to explain why they

16

didn't defer.

17

And then in light of some of the

Because sitting here, the irony to me is the

18

core focus of his position is that courts have

19

episodic involvement with these very complicated

20

plans, and yet, as I’ll get to in my second point,

21

most of his position is predicated on things that are

22

directly contrary to the court in this case that was

23

on the ground that looked at these issues.

24
25

He wants this Court, which has even less of
an -- a typical and constant involvement with the

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

2

plan, to second-guess the lower court, but -JUSTICE ALITO:

But even if the -- even if

3

no deference was owed to the administrator, could you

4

explain why the task for the district court was not

5

then simply to interpret what the plan means?

6

What puzzles me about -- something that

7

puzzles me about the -- the two decisions by the

8

Second Circuit are (a) why this is remedial; why isn't

9

it just a reinterpretation of the plan; (b) where

10

their -- what do equitable principles have to do with

11

this; and why should it be a discretionary decision

12

for the district court?

That would be the issue.

14

there’s no deference due to the administrator?

What does the plan mean?

Yes.

Isn't that the question, if

difficult question in this case.

back to deference just to make sure we don't lose on

19

that point, where I think we are squarely right.

20

I'm -- I'm glad we

But then I'm going to go

Now to your question.

Here's what happened:

21

Xerox made two arguments in the first round of

22

litigation.

23

argument was that a later plan applied retroactively.

24

They didn't want to apply the '89 plan.

25

This is very important.

Their first

Their second argument -- and this is -- here

are the best places where you can find it:

2

of the petition appendix -- that's the Second Circuit;

3

page 75a and 85a of the petition appendix -- this is

4

where the district court said it.

5

argument was that section 9.6 of the 1989 plan

6

permitted an appreciated offset, something more than

7

just a nominal offset.

and capricious.

20

isn't true, by the way.

But the court said:

Well, if that’s true

22

and if this is going to be windfall, maybe Xerox has

an equitable defense.

principles and say:

Well, since the plan doesn't

And then what happened -- and this is the

6

irony -- is Xerox went back -- and this right out of

7

page 143a of the joint appendix -- they proposed an

8

offset that effectively is an undisclosed $16 million

9

appreciation.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, but I think it's

14

kind of odd to say to the administrator:

want discretion, you should make as many rulings as

16

you can possibly think of because then you’ll get

17

discretion as to each of them.

you don't get any discretion at all on the other

20

provisions.

Look, if you

But if you only do

for efficiency's sake, like you say, we want

4

This is what we think the
I agree with you.

But in a rare case like this one -- where

5

Xerox's main point is:

We screwed up; we left out the

6

provision -- I think the appropriate thing for Xerox

7

to do would have said:

8

take this interpretation, even though we left out the

9

provision; but if not, then this is how we interpret

We think we can rely on it and

10

the plan.

I'm not saying you would -- they would

definitely get deference, but at least there would be

12

an argument that there’s a presumption of competence,

13

that there’s efficiency.

answer to your question:

the common law of trusts, said that once there was a

finding by a court of abuse of discretion, it could

decide to defer.

17

That is why the law, under

I agree with Xerox.

Ordinarily, the courts

18

would defer.

Under ERISA, ordinarily, if there’s

19

factual issues, they send it back.

20

Here, the court said, under these specific

21

facts, under this abuse of discretion, for a host of

22

reasons, not the least of which, Your Honor, is that

23

they are trying to take a fallback position on the

24

exact same issue, which the court expressly found in

25

The court of appeals said the SPDs did not disclose an

appreciation.

22

The -- the court of appeals said that the

23

relevant provision in this plan, the only one that

24

would have applied time value of money was missing,

25

but I argue that the consequence of these things is

that you can’t have a time value of money.

going to get to that in a second.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. STRIS:

So I am

That's a little different.

Now, to the last point you made

5

about it's a different issue.

I think we’re saying

6

the same thing.

7

right, that the task was slightly different.

8

first time, they interpreted what the offset should be

9

under the '89 plan, looking at a few things, and this

This is semantic.

10

time, they said, oh, we were arbitrary, so, now, we

at a few more things.

Why -- why -- as I

understand it -- which big if -- you and I are both

16

working at Xerox, and in year 1 -- and we each have

I stay, and I don't.

Okay?

going to grow somewhat -- as long as it wasn't 2007.

MR. STRIS:

I might spend it,

During my time, it -So, when figuring the

floor, what Xerox does is look to see how much it

5

grew.

later, and they say, you’re up above the floor,

7

good-bye, we will give you this, not the floor, okay.

8
9

They look at the whole thing, now, 10 years

Now, you are in the same position, and you
happen to come back to Xerox, and all they want to do

10

is say, you know, we’d like to assume yours grew, too,

11

I mean, not -- a little, anyway, and the first thing

12

they wanted to do is to say it should have grown the

13

same way we treat our own guys, as it having grown.

14

And the court of appeals says that's wrong

15

because you left the words out, but send it back to

way to grow it; here is how -- we will assume it grew

19

like an insurance company, the most incredibly

20

conservative people in the world, how -- how they

21

would have treated it as growing, if you bought an

22

annuity right then, and that just gives us even a

23

lower number.

MR. STRIS:

JUSTICE BREYER:

think it's either an abuse of discretion or you should

have listened more to the -- to the expert -- should

7

have done something else.

MR. STRIS:

I -- I understand that entirely.

I’d like to say a few things.

All of these points

10

would be very important if we were designing a plan in

the first place.

12

in this case is what parties would bargain to in the

13

first instance, if they had all the information.

15

I'm not suggesting that the result

The question here is Xerox left a provision

out of the plan, and now we have a problem.

I'm

What are

That's how we get to equity.

In fact, I think it would have been

19

appropriate -- if I were litigating the case at that

20

point, I would have argued you can't have an equitable

21

defense, you need to enforce the nominal offset, but

22

that ship has sailed.

23

So we go back on remand, and to -- to

24

Mr. Long's point about how it's standard to have an

25

actuarial offset -- take isclosure away for a

It's not standard to apply the -- the time

value of money to the entire defined contribution

balance.

4

I will not accept that characterization.
Under the principle of duplication, we

5

presented an alternative that used the time value of

money offset, but it applied it to the relevant

principle.

advocated something else.

What's

Isn't it what the lump sum

I don't think so.

This is a

14

defined benefits plan, and -- you know, from a

15

regulatory standpoint, as this case comes to this

16

17

the plan talks about non-duplication.

18

Section 9.6 of

19

force me to say, well, let's make an argument, what

20

are we going to think about non-duplication, we’re

21

trying to say that we’re not going to give you money

22

under this floor -- as you put it, Justice Breyer --

23

of the defined benefits plan, if it duplicates your

24

prior defined benefit payment.

understanding is that most of my clients didn't --

8

didn't have that option.

9

It's not clear from the record, but my

Now, I’d like to get back, just for a

10

second, Justice Alito, to your question, because it

MR. STRIS:

I'm saying that, when the court

8

district court never even considered sending it to the

9

administrator because there would be no reason to do

10

that. They didn't ask for it.

Then I don't understand what

24

the purpose of the remand from the Second Circuit to

25

the district court, after the Second Circuit's first

54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

decision, was.
In other words, you’re saying that they --

3

they found that anything other than an offset for the

4

amount of money that was actually received by the

5

beneficiary upon leaving Xerox would be -- would

6

violate the notice requirements.

7

MR. ROBERTS:

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

9
10

Well, I don't -So that interprets the plan.

There’s nothing left to do, then.
MR. ROBERTS:

I don't know that the -- that

11

the court of appeals actually found that the first

12

time around.

13

consequence of the lack of notice that was in -- in

14

the summary plan description.

15

Our point is that that was the

JUSTICE ALITO:

I understand you to be

16

saying that the concept of any appreciation of that

17

amount based on the time value of money is invalid,

18

because there wasn't proper notice for that.

19

there’s nothing left to do on remand, it seems to me.

20
21
22

So

I don't understand what the purpose of the
remand was.
MR. ROBERTS:

Well, I -- we -- we think in

23

most cases, it would have been an abuse of discretion

24

for the district court in light of the lack of notice

25

in the summary plan description to apply an

55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

appreciated offset.

But the district court also did

2

consider the reasonable expectations of the plan --

3

plan participants, and there might have been other

4

countervailing considerations that could have been

5

advanced by the -- the plan administrator, perhaps,

6

about the financial solvency of the plan or some other

7

matters, but -- but those weren't presented here.

8

The point is that, once the court -- when

9

the court remanded, the first task for the district

10

court on remand was to look at the plan terms because

11

this was a benefit action, determine whether those

12

plan terms addressed how to calculate the offset, but

13

here, the court couldn't rely on the plan terms,

14

really, for two reasons.

15

First, as the district court said, the plan

16

said virtually nothing about how to do it; and,

17

second, the point that I was making before, ERISA

18

prohibited the court from adopting an interpretation

19

that provided for more than the -- an offset greater

20

than the face value.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So, in principle, if -- if

22

we accept your argument, if other retirees who are

23

later rehired bring a lawsuit in another court, you

24

might have a different result because it would be up

25

to the -- up to that court to decide what was -- what

56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

was a proper result, right?

2

MR. ROBERTS:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

In the -That's the consequence of

not deferring to the plan administrator.

5

MR. ROBERTS:

You have --

If the plan -- if the plan

6

terms -- in an ordinary case, if there was an abuse of

7

discretion in interpreting the plan terms, the plan

8

terms would still address the issue.

9

be an additional violation of ERISA's notice

10

There wouldn't

requirement.
This is a unique case, in the sense that,

11
12

here, you’ve got not just an arbitrary -- an

13

unreasonable interpretation of the plan terms, but

14

you've also got the problem of the lack of notice in

15

the summary plan description, and you've also got the

16

problem that the plan terms are really silent on this

17

issue.

18
19
20

They just don't say anything about how to
calculate the offset.
JUSTICE BREYER:

It's a pretty big windfall

21

for people.

You’re working at Xerox, and your plan is

22

about approaching the minimum level -- let's quit and

23

then go invest it, and then come back 3 days before

24

you’re bound to retire, and then you’re going get

25

whatever the plan grew, and you’ll also get your

57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

minimum.

2

MR. ROBERTS:

I don't think it's a windfall,

3

Your Honor, because it depends on what the employees

4

were promised when they were deciding whether to come

5

back.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, why would anyone

7

promise them that kind of a deal?

8

MR. ROBERTS:

9

Well -- first of all, when

you’ve got a defined benefit plan and defined

10

contribution plan, there’s no requirement in ERISA,

11

and employers frequently -- or at least, sometimes,

12

would not offset the defined contribution benefits

13

from the defined benefit plan, and even in a floor­

14

offset arrangement, where they would, an employer

15

could provide less than the full amount --

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

What about -- a bit more

17

serious question -- I mean, that is a serious

18

question, but the more general question, what about

19

something that is analogous to Skidmore deference?

20

MR. ROBERTS:

Oh, God.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

(Laughter.)

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

So you say --

You say -- you take the --

24

the district judge here can take -- takes the

25

administrator's opinion for what it's worth.

58
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. ROBERTS:

Well --

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

He has to listen to it.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Can we go back to the urns?

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, that's essentially --

6

that's essentially the -- the principle that we're --

7

that we're talking about --

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:
principle, I thought.

10
11

MR. ROBERTS:

The court's not required to

apply its use of discretion and -JUSTICE BREYER:

it.

But he does have to read

He has to read it --

14

MR. ROBERTS:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

That is essentially the

-- review again.
Read it, and take it for

what it's worth.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

MR. ROBERTS:

19
20
21

So if --

Well, it's -- I think any

responsible district court would -- would do that.
JUSTICE BREYER:

You don't think they

22

MR. ROBERTS:

They would do that.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

MR. ROBERTS:

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.

Okay.

Of course.
So you disagree with

59
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Mr. Stris.

Do you think the district court should

2

listen to what the plan administrator has to say?
MR. ROBERTS:

3

Well, I think that, in trust

4

law, that -- under the principles of trust law, that

5

Mr. Stris is correct, that the district court has

6

the -- the -- the court would have discretion to

7

formulate the remedy and could direct the trustee --

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
Mr. Roberts, is it a remedy?

Is it -- is it -So that’s -- one thing

10

is you can view this as the district court as

11

substitute interpreter of the plan, or another way you

12

can look at it is to say, the -- the benefit

13

determination was wrong, we reject it, the court

14

rejects it.

15

wrongful determination.

16

in the district court, an interpretation of the plan

17

or a remedy for a wrongful determination?

So, now, there is a remedy for that

MR. ROBERTS:

18

So is this, what’s going on

In a benefits action, the

19

first question is to interpret the plan, but what you

20

have here is a plan that is silent and a plan that --

21

where interpreting the plan to provide for a certain

22

kind of offset, there is inadequate notice in the

23

summary plan description, so there’s a violation of

24

ERISA.

25

So, in this circumstance, not ordinarily,

60
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

whenever there’s a misinterpretation of the plan, but

2

in the circumstances here, it is a remedial decision

3

because the court has to fill the gap in the plan

4

that’s the result of the silence of the plan.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, we interpret gaps in

6

-- in documents all the time.

7

interpreting a document, figuring out what it provides

8

for in a lot of situations that it does not explicitly

9

cover.

10

That's part of

I don't know why that isn't interpreting the

plan.
MR. ROBERTS:

11

When -- the analogy here is

12

to the trust law situation, where trusts -- where --

13

where courts modify the terms of a trust because the

14

terms are illegal or there’s a change of

15

circumstances, like the cy pres doctrine.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

Thank you, counsel.

Thank you.
Mr. Long, you have 4 minutes remaining.

19

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR.

20

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

21

MR. LONG:

The remaining plan terms are not

22

silent.

Section 9.6 says that the offset should be

23

the accrued benefit attributable to the prior lump-sum

24

distribution, and that's an annuity payable at age 65.

25

So there is plan language.

61
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

It's -- it is not completely unambiguous,

2

but the plan is certainly not silent, and the

3

Solicitor General, in its brief on the merits to this

4

Court did -- retracted that suggestion that the plan

5

was silent.

6

On this question of the 1990 amendment and

7

when the -- the reconstructed account methodology that

8

the Second Circuit said was invalid got put back in,

9

pages 66a and 67a of the appendix to the petition

10

shows that that got put back in, in 1990, and not

11

later.

12

On trust law and what trust law shows,

13

obviously, the Court will have to sort it out, but we

14

stand with Professor Scott, with his treatise, which

15

is key, to the Restatement Second, which was in effect

16

when ERISA was adopted.

17

which correlates with section 187 of the Restatement

18

Second, we think supports our approach that, unless

19

there is bad faith or the trustee is acting outside

20

the bounds of discretion -- and the court will get the

21

trustee within the bounds of discretion, but unless

22

there is some reason to think the trustee can't fairly

23

and honestly exercise the discretion, the terms of the

24

trust assign that responsibility to the trustee, and,

25

therefore, the trustee should exercise that

Section 187 of his treatise,

62
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

discretion.
And then, finally, on this question of

3

notice and whether there was adequate notice, not of

4

the reconstructed account methodology, but of the

5

plain vanilla annuity, the ordinary way this is done,

6

we would urge the Court not to accept these

7

representations that, oh, it's just the same question;

8

if the notice for one is inadequate, the notice for

9

the other must also be inadequate.

10

I mean, there’s actually Second Circuit law,

11

the McCarthy against Dun & Bradstreet case, that holds

12

that a summary plan description does not have to

13

completely explain how you do every offset and

14

actuarial adjustment.

15

Many of them apply just to relatively small groups of

16

people, including this one that we’re talking about.

There are so many of them.

17

There are 14,000 --

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But the court of appeals

19

held that this one was inadequate because it did not

20

say that you were going to take into account the time

21

value of money.

22

this one was bad, the same reason would apply to the

23

plain vanilla.

24
25

If that's the reason it held that

MR. LONG:

Well, if the court had actually

held that -- I mean, I would urge you not to read the

63
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

court's opinion that way.

2

that, I think that would be a mistake because there --

3

there are -- you know, it's just so typical that you

4

have actuarial adjustments in pensions and in -- and

5

in general.

6

I mean, I think, if it held

I mean, people don't expect to take out a

7

mortgage on a house for 20 years and pay no interest

8

or buy a bond from the Treasury for 20 years and

9

receive no interest.

So I think, if it's going to be

10

the ordinary, plain vanilla way this is done, the PBGC

11

way, the safe harbor way, it may be sufficient -- may

12

very well be sufficient to simply --

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Long, would you --

14

would you explain your position on the picture we were

15

given of these people who were rehired and -- and they

16

get, periodically, a statement that says, you are

17

going to get 2,000-some-odd dollars; and then, 5 years

18

later, they get a statement that says, no, it's only

19

$5.18, or something like that.

20

MR. LONG:

Right, and -- and those

21

statements, which are non-plan documents, said

22

there -- there may be an adjustment or there will be

23

an adjustment for prior distributions.

24

like Mr. Frommert’s, that's the $5 case, the reason

25

it's $5 is because his entire defined contribution

64
Alderson Reporting Company

And in a case

Official

1

benefit virtually came from that large lump sum.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And not even about why --

3

why it was $5.

4

him the perception he was going to get over 2,000 when

5

it was so much less?

6

It's why did he get notices that gave

MR. LONG:

Well, because those -- those

7

particular forms, which again are not plan documents

8

and he really should show individual reliance and

9

prejudice, didn't do the calculation.

He got another

10

document that did do the calculation, and that's when

11

this started.
