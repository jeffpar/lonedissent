ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. RUSSELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Congress rarely makes ignorance of the law a

12

defense to civil liability, and the Fair Debt Collection

13

Practices Act is no exception to that rule.

14

may seem unfair to hold defendants in some sense

15

strictly liable for legal mistakes in the civil context,

16

the accumulated wisdoms of generations of legal practice

17

has been that attempting to fix that unfairness through

18

a mistake of law defense causes more harm than it

19

prevents.

20

While it

And as a consequence, in light of that

21

subtle understanding, courts should not read a Federal

22

statute to establish a mistake of law defense, unless

23

Congress quite plainly makes that intent to do so clear.

24

And in this case, nothing in the text, structure, or the

25

history of the bona fide error provision of the FDCPA

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

indicates such an intent.

2

I could begin with the -- the text of the

3

statute.

4

provision that the defendant's violation be in good

5

faith, that it have been bona fide.

6

It is not enough under the bona fide error

There is an additional element, that the

7

defendant has to show that the violation was not

8

intentional.

9

is not rendered unintentional simply because the

And in common legal discourse, a violation

10

defendant misunderstood the legal consequences of its

11

actions.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think -- reading

13

"intentional" the way you just articulated is absolutely

14

right, but when you add -- I don't see what work "bona

15

fide error" does in the statute, if "intentional" should

16

be read in this case to mean what you say.

17

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, I think it captures the

18

circumstance in which somebody makes a mistake of fact,

19

but does so and with -- not in good faith.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think -

But you say:

Well,

21

intentional means you meant to send out the document;

22

you meant to serve it; in other words, no specific

23

intent requirement.

24

seems, doesn't make the activity not intentional under

25

the traditional understanding of intentional.

But if -- a bona fide error, it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

MR. RUSSELL:

But I think that's right.

I

2

think both provisions do separate work, and so that if

3

all it took to show that something wasn't intentional is

4

that you didn't mean to violate the law, it would be

5

very difficult to understand what work "bona fide" was

6

doing in that circumstance.

7

And I think Congress included the bona fide

8

requirement in order to capture instances in which

9

people make factual mistakes, but not in good faith.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I really don't think that

11

the -- the word that we're wrestling with here is the -

12

the word "intentional."

13

"violation," because violation -- when it says the

14

violation was intentional or unintentional, does

15

"violation" mean the act that constitutes a violation of

16

the law, or does "violation" mean the -- the fact of

17

violating the law?

18

MR. RUSSELL:

It seems to me it's the word

I think that is the central

19

question here and it is Respondents' best argument.

I

20

think that the word "violation" is best understood to

21

refer to the act.

22

that word in the statutory phrase "knowing violation" in

23

a number of cases, and that's how the courts of appeals

24

have construed the term "intentional" -- or "intentional

25

violation" in the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural

That is how this Court has construed

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

Workers Protection Act, which we cited in our brief.

2

I did mention in our brief that it is a less

3

usual formulation, "intentional violation," and at the

4

time we wrote our briefs we weren't able to find any

5

cases from this Court construing that particular term.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what -- the part that's

7

worrying me most is where the lawyer is the debt

8

collector.

9

has a client of debt collectors, and the clients all

All right?

So he's within the act, and he

10

say:

Please go collect the debt.

And they say:

We

11

want to do this, like in this -- suppose in this case,

12

they say:

13

write a letter to that effect; we won't collect it; now,

14

is that legal?

Tell us if you don't owe it; ask them to

15

And the lawyer looks up everything in sight

16

and says, yes, it's legal.

And then that's what he

17

thinks.

18

asks the FTC and they say, yes, it's legal.

19

is.

20

behold, this Court, surprisingly, holds the opposite.

21

Well, he shouldn't be liable.

22

about that, he can never defend his client.

23

answer is:

24

client, that's what you have to do.

25

meaning of this statute.

All the circuits have said this.

Everybody's told him it's legal.

And then he
So there he

And lo and

And if he has to worry
The only

Whatever the man says who is opposed to your

Alderson Reporting Company

That can't be the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, let me address the

2

hypothetical, to make sure I understand it.

3

talking -- well, first of all, if we are talking about a

4

case in which they've asked the opinion of the FTC, they

5

are entitled to the safe harbor defense, because

6

Congress specifically -

7
8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:
is:

No, no.

If we're

What the FTC said

We won't give you one.
MR. RUSSELL:

Okay.

Well, in that

10

circumstance, I think it's important to distinguish

11

between lawyers who are simply giving advice to debt

12

collector clients -- they're not covered by the act.

13

It's only when the lawyer engages in debt collection

14

activities himself.

15

the lawyer is simply -

16
17
18
19
20
21

And a lot of the time the debt -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Does litigation constitute

debt -- debt collection activity?
MR. RUSSELL:

Yes.

This Court held in

Heintz that litigation can be a form of JUSTICE BREYER:
litigating for a client.

So he is a lawyer

That was my hypothetical.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

24

MR. RUSSELL:

25

In that circumstance -- in

that circumstance, I think yes, the lawyer can be held

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

liable for -- for mistakes.

2

Court -

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

But to the extent this

It's not a mistake.

The

4

point is, in a sense, that any decent lawyer would say

5

that's what the law was; that sometimes lawyers get

6

surprised because courts don't always act the way they

7

think is reasonable.

8
9

MR. RUSSELL:

And when that happens, their

clients are almost never protected from liability,

for

10

-- because they did what their lawyers reasonably told

11

them to.

12
13

And the antitrust JUSTICE BREYER:

Why aren't they in good

faith?

14

MR. RUSSELL:

The lawyer?

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MR. RUSSELL:

Both.

Well, certainly, because there

17

generally is a mistake of law defense.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Ah, but that's in your view

19

of it.

I am saying that the opposite view of it is that

20

your view of it puts lawyers in an impossible position,

21

let alone the client.

22

MR. RUSSELL:

Well -

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

It -- it's not just that

24

it's unfair.

It's worse than unfair.

25

under an obligation to represent his client, and he

Alderson Reporting Company

The lawyer is

2

to this particular plaintiff whose view of the law is

3

totally contrary to every circuit court that's ever

4

decided it.

5

position?

6

Just pay money

Now, how can you put lawyers in that

MR. RUSSELL:

I think the lawyers are not in

7

a terribly different position than is, for example, the

8

executive of a company that has a fiduciary duty to its

9

shareholders to maximize profits and is considering a

10

venture that could violate the antitrust laws.

11

that circumstance, they have to make a calculated

12

judgment, because the antitrust laws don't have a

13

mistake of law defense.

14

civil -

15

And in

And neither does any other

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But you are sort of

16

begging the question there.

17

also don't have a bona fide error defense, and the

18

question is whether that includes a legal mistake

19

defense.

20

MR. RUSSELL:

I mean, the antitrust laws

That's right.

And my -- my

21

point simply is that you shouldn't read that defense as

22

necessarily creating a mistake of law defense simply

23

because you think it's so unfair, because that

24

unfairness is simply common.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

But it -- but it suggests

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

that you would like a -- a sensible interpretation of

2

this that avoids the result I said, if possible.

3

there is a different way of going about it, which is you

4

could say that a bona fide error in respect to a lawyer

5

imposes much higher standards on that lawyer than it

6

does on most -- and it's simply a client -- that before

7

you can call an error bona fide, that lawyer really has

8

to look into it.

9

to have gotten -- and made an effort to get a letter

He has to have asked the FTC.

10

back.

11

the other way, well, where?

12

not bona fide.

And

He has

And if there are one or two circuits that hold

13

And if you don't, you are

Now, that would get to virtually the same

14

place but it would protect the lawyer against true legal

15

surprise.

16

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, I do think that if you

17

disagree with us, that's the better reading than the

18

second.

19

It's not the reading that the Sixth Circuit gave in this

20

case.

21

That's not the reading most courts have given.

But I think there is every reason to think

22

that if Congress was concerned about the especially

23

problematic application of this statute to lawyer

24

conduct and particularly to litigation conduct, it would

25

have expected courts to deal with that in different way,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

and not through the bona fide error defense, which,

2

after all, applies to lawyer who are engaging in the

3

same conduct as lay debt collectors and to nonlawyers

4

alike.

5

this problem.

6

It's a very blunt instrument for dealing with

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

One -- one of the

7

things you have to include on this initial communication

8

is the name of the creditor, right?

9

MR. RUSSELL:

10

Yes.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

So let's say

11

the bank that is the creditor is being sold or taken

12

over.

13

have merged, but, you know, the closing date of the

14

merger is two months later or whatever.

It's just not

15

clear what the name of the creditor is.

So you -- you

16

are not a lawyer, but you are trying to collect the

17

debt, and you go -- you fill in, I --

18

B, and you say:

19

it turns out that it's -- it's B.

20

bona fide error.

21

And, you know, you have heard that, well, they

it's either A or

I think it's A, and you fill it in and
Let's say that's a

Okay?

But if you are sitting there as the debt

22

collector and you say:

I don't know if it's A or B.

23

And you say:

24

the lawyer and the lawyer says:

25

mean, it's -- it's A.

I know; I'll call the lawyer.

You call

Oh, it's -- it's B -- I

And you put down A and it turns

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

out it's wrong, aren't -- you are in a worse position if

2

you ask the lawyer than if you didn't, right?

3

MR. RUSSELL:

No, because in either

4

circumstance it would be a factual error.

5

subject to the bona fide error defense.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It would be

No, it's a -- it's a

7

legal -- the lawyer looks at it and says:

8

know, the merger is not going to close for whatever, but

9

I think it's still this bank.

10

Well, you

And it turns out his

legal analysis of who the creditor is was wrong.

11

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, again, I'm not sure that

12

that's a legal -- but assuming that it is a legal

13

mistake -

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

MR. RUSSELL:

Yes.

-- I think that the client is

16

not -- I mean, if it's a legal mistake, it's a legal

17

mistake for the client as well as the lawyer, and I

18

think either one of them would be in the same position.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But if the client

20

just says:

21

going to make -- I think it's A -- it's a bona fide

22

error, but it's an error -- he gets the benefit of that

23

position.

24

benefit.

25

I'm not going to ask the lawyer; I'm just

But if he asks the lawyer, he doesn't get the

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, under our view, he

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

wouldn't get benefit under either circumstance, because

2

it would be a mistake of law and the statute doesn't

3

cover it.

4

If I could finish my answer -

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Who the -- who the

6

creditor is is necessarily a mistake of law, rather than

7

fact?

8
9

MR. RUSSELL:

No.

That's why I -- I

initially told you I thought it was a mistake of fact,

10

and that would be a mistake of fact for the lawyer or

11

the client.

12

And I think actually, in that scenario CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, is it a

13

mistake of fact if the lawyer does legal research to

14

find it out?

15

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, I don't think -

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

says:

18

the merger, not the announcement.

Well, it depends upon the date of the closing of

19

MR. RUSSELL:

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21
22

He looks and he

Well, if the And it turns out

that's a legal mistake.
MR. RUSSELL:

Then I -- I don't think the

23

defense would apply and I don't think it would apply to

24

the client, either.

25

But I do think that if you are especially

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

concerned about applying the law to lawyers and to

2

litigation, it's much more likely that Congress intended

3

the Court to deal with that in a tailored way by

4

interpreting the substantive provisions of the statute

5

with that particular problem in mind.

6

Knowing that Congress didn't have litigation

7

conduct specifically in mind when it enacted this

8

statute, because at the time lawyers were excluded from

9

the act altogether, and keeping in mind in addition that

10

Congress presumably didn't intend the act to

11

unreasonably interfere with litigation collection

12

methods, and the constitutional aspects -

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

So how -- how do we do

14

that?

15

runs the same risk in antitrust law in a whole other lot

16

of areas.

17

lawyer into it, the lawyer has what he doesn't have in

18

an antitrust case under your reading, which is an

19

incentive to distort the law in order to protect his own

20

pocketbook.

21
22
23

Because you see, you are quite right.

Absolutely right.

The client

But once you bring the

And that is, to me, a big problem.
So you say there is -- there is a -- a way

around that.

And what?

MR. RUSSELL:

And that is to recognize that,

24

as this Court held in Heintz, that Congress didn't

25

intend for every unsuccessful lawsuit to result in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

liability under this statute.

2

to some particular provision of the statute that was

3

violated by what the lawyer did in litigation.

4

Plaintiffs have to point

And for example, the lawyer makes a mistake

5

about the statute of limitations.

6

that that constitutes a violation of the provisions

7

against deceptive practices or unconscionable collection

8

practices -

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Some courts have held

The lawyer writes a letter

10

to the client.

The first thing the lawyer tries to do

11

is to settle the case.

12

the money, and by the way, if you don't owe it, tell me

13

in writing."

"Dear Client:

Please send me

14

Okay?

15

a legal activity.

16

because nobody goes to court anymore.

17

will, if necessary, so he's part of this.

18

That's what the lawyer does.

It's at the heart of practicing law,
And -- though he

Now, how do we get out of this problem that

19

I'm putting?

20

because I think it's a big problem.

21

MR. RUSSELL:

I'm really looking for an answer to that,

Well, typically -- I don't

22

know that that's a uniquely lawyerly activity.

23

collectors do that all the time.

24
25

That's

Lay debt

But to the extent you think that Congress
could not have intended that kind of activity to be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

subject to liability when somebody makes a reasonable

2

legal error, I think it's more likely that Congress

3

intended you to look at what provision of the statute

4

are they saying was violated and construe that provision

5

in a way that is consistent with your expectations about

6

what Congress would have meant, rather than providing -

7

rather than, you know, taking the bona fide error

8

provision to do that work, when the bona fide error

9

provision is much broader and would apply to all kinds

10

of mistakes of law, including having this consequence of

11

basically giving debt collectors the opportunity to take

12

the narrowest possible construction of -- of consumers'

13

rights, as long as the -- the question is unsettled.

14

The other reason to think that Congress

15

wouldn't have intended this to be the solution to that

16

problem is that at the time they wrote the bona fide

17

error defense, lawyers weren't included, so this could

18

not have been Congress' intended solution to that

19

particular problem.

20

And at the time Congress used this language,

21

it was borrowing it from the Truth in Lending Act, where

22

it had an established meaning in the circuit courts as

23

not including the mistake of law defense, and that

24

remained the interpretation of the Fair Debt Collection

25

Practices Act provision as well, for -- for nearly

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

25 years.

2

It wasn't until 2002 that the court of

3

appeals first suggested that it did not extend to legal

4

mistakes.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, if the district

6

court were to say:

7

mistake of law not covered, but I'm not awarding

8

statutory damages because -

9
10

You violated the act; this was a

MR. RUSSELL:

I think they -

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- in this case, just

11

for the reasons here, you did something the Sixth

12

Circuit -- or that the circuit law said was permissible,

13

so you didn't do it -- you did it intentionally because

14

you did the violation of the act, but it was based on a

15

mistake of law.

16

MR. RUSSELL:

I do think that that's a

17

perfectly permissible exercise of discretion.

18

gave the district court discretion with respect to

19

statutory damages, and that's another way of dealing

20

with this problem.

21
22
23
24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Congress

Well, what about

attorneys' fees?
MR. RUSSELL:

No, the attorneys' fees is not

discretionary in that sense.
And so there are other structural reasons,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

though, to think that Congress knew how to make a

2

mistake of law defense clearly and did not do so here.

3

Congress did provide, in effect, a mistake

4

of law defense to civil penalties.

5

provision that applies to this statute, which is at

6

15 U.S.C. 45(m)(1), and that's quoted in relevant part

7

on page 24 of the blue brief, provides for very serious

8

civil penalties for somebody who acts with actual

9

knowledge or knowledge fairly implied that the act was

10

The civil penalties

prohibited.

11

And I think that provision shows two things.

12

One, it shows that Congress knows how to make an

13

express -- how to expressly speak to a defendant's

14

knowledge of the unlawfulness of his conduct.

15

And in addition, it shows that Congress

16

treated knowledge of unlawfulness as an aggravating

17

circumstance, as something deserving of special

18

punishment, rather than, as Respondents would have it,

19

most of the time being a minimum prerequisite for any

20

liability at all.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Congress wrote this

22

statute to -- to have a cottage industry of litigation.

23

These were attorneys -

24
25

MR. RUSSELL:
that.

Well, I -- I would not say

I would say that Congress wrote this statute, in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

19
1

a way, to encourage private enforcement, to be sure.

2

enacted statutory damages and fee shifting because it

3

understood that this was an industry in which there was

4

a particular risk of very aggressive and harmful

5

practices, in part because debt collectors don't rely on

6

the good will of the consumers they deal with in order

7

to prosper.

8

the industry push people to aggressive practices, and

9

Congress wanted this statute to be a counterweight to

10
11

It

And so all of the economic incentives in

that.
And as in many circumstances, Congress

12

enacts statutory language and puts up requirements and

13

holds people to them civilly because the -- the general

14

rule in our legal system is that the risk and the cost

15

of a legal mistake is generally allocated to the

16

lawbreaker in the civil context and not to the people's

whose rights have been violated.

19

differently here.

20

And there is no reason

We were speaking earlier on about the words

21

"intentional violation," and I wanted to bring to the

22

Court's attention the fact that after we filed our

And it's consistent with the way that the

Court has construed the phrase "knowing violation" in a

7

number of contexts, including in -- in the criminal

8

context, where it's much more common for Congress to

9

make a mistake of law a defense to liability.

10

I mentioned before that that kind of history

11

of the development of the statute -- I think it's also

12

worth noting, Justice Breyer, that at the time, Congress

13

withdrew the attorney exemption from the act.

14

the uniform opinion of the courts of appeals at that

15

time and all the district courts that the language of

16

the bona fide error defense did not create a mistake of

law defense.

18

expect that in subjecting the attorneys to that

19

statutory regime, that the bona fide error provision

20

would be the solution to any special problems.

21

It was

And again, Congress had no reason to

22

attentive to this special area of concern.

23

made a tailored adjustment to the statute to make clear

24

that pleadings are not an initial communication

25

triggering the validation notice requirement.

Alderson Reporting Company

In 2006, it

And I

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

think that demonstrates that Congress is -- is on top of

2

this issue, and it stands at the ready to make

3

adjustments that are necessary to make this legal system

4

operate in a way that both makes sense, but nonetheless

5

gives effect to their intent to treat attorney debt

6

collectors on a par with regular debt collectors who are

7

not attorneys.

8

I should also mention, Justice Breyer, to

9

the extent there are some really intractable problems

10

with respect to the act application to attorneys,

11

there -- there is ongoing litigation in the lower courts

12

about the Noerr-Pennington doctrine about how the

13

constitutional implications of regulating in-court

14

activity apply to the Court's interpretation of the

15

statutory provisions.

And again, I think it's more likely that

17

that is the solution Congress would have intended, an

18

interpretive solution -

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, maybe your colleague

So I was giving the example of state

deceptive practice, because there's not a -- all it does

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY

24

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE

25

SUPPORTING PETITIONER

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1

3

MR. JAY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I would like, if I may, to pick up with a

4

point that Mr. Russell made, which is that the FDCPA is

5

of a piece with most civil regulatory statutes, in that

6

it makes knowledge of the law an aggravating factor and

7

subjects violators who know that they are violating a

8

law subject to substantial civil penalties of up to

9

$16,000 per day.

But it doesn't completely excuse

10

violations based on a lack of knowledge of the law.

11

order to be excused, the violation must have resulted

12

from a bona fide error and meet all three elements of

13

the bona fide error defense.

14
15
16

In

We think that two of those elements are not
satisfied by the Respondents' error in this case.
First, legal errors, for the reason Mr.

17

Russell explained, aren't unintentional.

18

asked about whether the phrase "the violation is not

19

intentional" is a signal in that respect.

20

the work that that phrase, "the violation was not

21

intentional," does in this circumstance is to show that

22

the portion of the debt collector's conduct that

23

triggers the violation of the statute, it was -- is what

24

must be unintentional.

25

Justice Scalia

We think that

Let me illustrate that with an example.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

Under the statute, a debt collector who places a call to

2

a debtor at home after 9:00 at night may well violate

3

the statute; likely does violate the statute.

4

must be unintentional for that debt collector to make

5

out the bona fide error defense is not that the

6

telephone call had been -- had been placed

7

unintentionally, but rather that the debt collector

8

didn't have knowledge, for example, because of an error

9

about what time zone the debtor lives in.

10

So what

The -- the debt collector didn't know that

11

the call was being placed after 9:00 at night.

12

an unintentional error, and it is excused under the

13

statute if the debt collector can also show that it

14

maintains procedures reasonably adapted to prevent any

15

such errors.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That is

And your example of that

17

couldn't happen, because if you were calling debtors,

18

you should certainly check what time of evening the call

19

is.

20

second problem, the second -- how could that possibly be

21

careful procedure, if you don't even check to see what

22

time zone the person is in?

23

So you get over the first problem, but then on the

MR. JAY:

Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg,

24

if -- if you check, but due to a keyboarding error, for

25

example, Arizona is entered as Alabama or an error in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

time zone is entered in whatever record is being

2

consulting by the debt collector, that's the kind of

3

factual error, a clerical, bookkeeping type error

4

that -- that Congress had in mind when it created this

5

defense.

6

created this -- this defense in identical terms in a

7

number of other statutes; federal agencies have

8

construed the identical language in a number of other

9

statutes.

And it bears repeating that Congress has

And never has Congress or a federal agency

10

contemplated that one of these defenses would, in fact,

11

encompass legal errors.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you know why when

13

Congress codified that law errors don't count, codified

14

that for the Truth in Lending Act purposes, it didn't

15

make the corresponding change in the others?

16

MR. JAY:

We don't have a specific

17

indication, Justice Ginsburg, why it didn't go back and

18

revise every other statute that -- that already had such

19

a defense.

20

Congress was revising the Truth in Lending Act in a

21

statute called the Truth in Lending Simplification Act,

22

and the -- the statute in which that was passed didn't

23

make any other -- any other changes to non-financial

24

statutes.

25

But I think that the answer is simply that

It didn't reopen the Federal -- Fair Debt

Alderson Reporting Company

In fact, the

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1

relevant portion of the FDCPA, Section 1692k, hasn't

2

been amended in any way since Congress first enacted it

3

in 1977.

4

So we think that the relevance of the 1980

5

amendment to TILA is simply this:

6

consistent pattern by Congress and by the agencies such

7

as the Department of Housing and Urban Development and

8

the Federal Reserve Board that interpret statutes with

9

identical or very similar bona fide error provisions to

It's part of a

that that is not uncommon under any civil statute, that

18

when a court of appeals has precedent on point, that

19

there is always a possibility that that precedent will

20

be reversed.

21

Now, of course, this statute has a very

22

short statute of limitations.

It's one year.

23

there's some possibility that the law will change down

24

the road, that short statute of limitations will prevent

most violations from being reconsidered down the road

MR. JAY:

In the past decade,

Mr. Chief Justice, they have been asked seven times for

adopted in the regulations they are cited in footnote 10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So that's not a very

realistic procedure to rely on, is it?

4

MR. JAY:

Well, the debt collection industry

5

seems to not have asked very many times, Mr. Chief

6

Justice.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And why is that?

8

Because it's a little difficult dealing with the FTC

bureaucracy and getting an answer from them in a

10

reasonable time?

11

MR. JAY:

I submit, Mr. Chief Justice, that

12

first, even if this were relevant to what Congress

13

intended the -- how Congress intended the adviser

14

opinion process to work when it wrote this provision in

15

1977, that the debt collection industry, as we pointed

16

out in our brief -- if you ask the FTC for an adviser

17

opinion, and it sides against the requester, which,

18

incidentally, in none of these four opinions has it ever

19

done -- in each case it sided with the requester -- but

20

if it sides against, then the requester is on notice of

21

the law.

22

mentioned at the outset, the requester is going to be in

23

the category of -- for heightened penalties, because it

will be very difficult to suggest that you don't know

the law.

And the requester is going to be -- as I

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you are saying

2

that the debt collection industry doesn't does ask the

3

FTC, which would be a safe harbor for them, because if

4

they get a bad answer, they may not follow it and then

5

they may be subject to heightened penalties?

6

MR. JAY:

Well, I'm saying,

7

Mr. Chief Justice, that the -- that they would

understandably prefer to ask their own lawyer for an

they are home free under the bona fide error defense.

If you -- if you want an informal
If you want the

We don't think that's at all inconsistent

with what Congress intended, and we do think that

19

Congress intended that this be the primary avenue.

20

if you look at the advisory opinion provision of the

21

Truth in Lending Act, we think that illustrates it.

22

And

At the time Congress enacted the FDCPA, the

23

Truth in Lending Act advisory opinion provision had only

24

been on the books for a couple of years, but it had

25

already filled more than 100 pages of the Code of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

Federal Regulations with advisory opinions.

2

think that that's how Congress intended for the law

3

under this statute to be clarified as well, not in a way

4

that effectively confers qualified immunity on debt

5

collectors whenever there is an ambiguity in the law.

6

And we

We think that that is reinforced as well by

7

a substantive aspect of the statute, which is that

8

Congress recognized -- and this is in particular in the

9

legislative history at page 18 in footnote 9 of our

10

brief -- that the debt collection industry is extremely

11

aggressive and looks for loopholes whenever they exist.

12

So the substantive prohibitions of the

13

statute, especially 1692d, e, and f, are written in such

14

a way that they contain broad, substantive prohibitions

15

that are illustrated by examples, but those examples

16

expressly are illustrative and not exclusive.

17

would not have wanted a debt collector to be able to

18

say:

19

addressed by the statute and has not yet expressly been

20

addressed by any judicial opinion, and to say:

21

that law is not clearly established.

22

Congress

Well, gee, this -- this practice is not expressly

Well,

We think it's -- may I finish the

11

MR. COAKLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The starting point for discerning

congressional intent is the text of the statute.

13

Respondents submit that in a review of the text of this

14

statute, all of the components may be read plainly to

15

include the bona fide error defense, to include legal

16

error, starting with the words that the Court was

17

discussing with Mr. Russell and Mr. Jay, "violation not

intentional," moving on to "violation resulting from a

19

bona fide error," then "the maintenance of procedures

20

reasonably adapted."

The

The Sixth Circuit and the trial court and -

22

have construed this statute in a plain-meaning analysis;

23

that is to say, they start with the plain meaning of

24

each of those words and construe them in their context.

25

They did not find an ambiguity.

They did not find an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

34

absurdity.

2

those components may be squared with a -- with a legal

3

error analysis.

4

They found that each of those -- each of

Petitioner even concedes with respect to the

5

element of "violation not intentional" that our

6

interpretation is, quote, "not linguistically

7

impossible," end quote.

8
9

What -- what Petitioner has done is to avoid
the conventional standards of -- of congressional -- I

10

mean, of statutory interpretation, which is the

11

plain meaning from Lamie, and moving, then, outward if

12

necessary.

13

unrelated statutes such as TILA, then going to the safe

14

harbor, and then pulling the words "violation" and

15

"intentional" out of the first prong, taking them out of

16

context, taking them out of order, and then applying

17

them to this maxim, "ignorance of the law."

18

And they have opted instead for looking at

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Even -

And also saying -- and

19

then this sentence is what I would like to have your

20

response on, that there is no statute -- Federal statute

21

that makes mistake of law a defense.

22

highly extraordinary, and if that's what Congress meant

23

to do, to make something that ordinarily is no defense a

24

defense, we would expect Congress to do so expressly.

25

MR. COAKLEY:

So this would be

Justice Ginsburg, that is

their argument, that it is unprecedented.

But their

2

unprecedented argument gets them nowhere.

That is one

3

of the panoply of arguments that is outside the plain

4

meaning that they go to to say well, this is

5

unprecedented; Congress couldn't have intended this.

6

There are reports that read the TILA bona

7

fide error to mean legal error at one point in time, so

8

it wasn't unprecedented to the extent of that, and what

9

did Congress do with respect to TILA?

In 1980, they

10

didn't like the interpretation that they were getting

11

with respect to legal error from the TILA error, which

12

is a totally different statute, and so they reacted by

13

amending TILA to say no legal error in TILA.

14

They did not correspondingly amend the

15

FDCPA, which shows Congress's intent to distinguish the

16

two statutes.

1986 it went up a level when we added lawyers, and the

11

exemption went out and in 1995 it went up another level

12

when we added litigating lawyers.

13

But most certainly it went back to 1977 and

14

included lay debt collectors, and lay debt collectors

didn't get a "get out of jail free" card here by just

with Mr. Russell, is -- is exemplified by your question.

10

If a lay debt collector calls a lawyer in the 1977 to

11

1986 round and asks a lawyer for an interpretation of

12

this act, and he base -- he relies upon that and acts

13

accordingly, per their interpretation only applying to

14

clerical error, that lay debt collector who relied upon

15

advice of counsel is out of luck if the decision goes

16

against the lay debt collector, because he or she has no

17

error of law as a defense.

18

unfairness go up as the time goes on.

19
20
21

So it goes up, the levels of

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's true of antitrust

defendants, too.
MR. COAKLEY:

But in this, Your Honor, there

22

is a -- there is a bona fide error defense that has been

23

crafted into this statute.

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, I see that.

Is it -

is it -- what do you think of the idea that your

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

38
1

opponent here has suggested that the way to deal with

2

the lawyer's problem that I mentioned is simply read the

3

substantive provisions, so that there is no violation

4

for ordinary legal activity where they have gone and

5

asked the FTC or you know, all the things that are

6

against them?

What you would have to do.

7

That isn't so hard to do as I first thought,

8

because the words that seem to make -- the primary words

9

of what is outlawed are the words "unfair or

10

unconscionable means."

11

know -- I doubt that there are other words in the

12

statute that forbid lawyers from doing anything that

13

really shouldn't be forbidden.

14

call people up in the middle of the night and harass

15

them and so forth.

16

Now I -- I doubt -- you would

I mean, they shouldn't

But -- but you could read unfair and

17

unconscionable means to say that where a lawyer is

18

really hit by surprise, you know, all the circuits were

19

against him, the FTC wouldn't give him an opinion, that

20

he no longer is acting unfairly and unconscionably.

21

What about that?

22

MR. COAKLEY:

Justice Breyer, I don't think

23

that gives credence to the 1977 focus when lawyers were

24

not part of the statute.

25

heightens the unfairness of it once lawyers come in in

Certainly your example

10

antitrust problem, because it is just as much.

11

saw the special problem of putting the lawyer in the

12

impossible situation that you've just described.

13

But I

Now it's with respect to that problem that

14

he offers the cure of reading the words "unconscionable"

15

and what is it?

16

Read those words to exempt the lawyer when he's in the

17

dilemma I discussed, and therefore the lawyer will not

18

have an incentive to -- to skew his advice.

19

"Unconscionable and unfair means."

MR. COAKLEY:

I believe that the lawyer

20

would be just subject to the rigors of the bona fide

21

error defense, the way any other debt collector as

22

defined from 1977 forward would be.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I suppose it would

24

make interpretation of the act a little more difficult.

25

The same practice would be unconscionable in -- not

Alderson Reporting Company

40
1

unconscionable in one circumstance, you would have an

2

opinion saying this is not unconscionable; but yet if

3

somebody else does it, you know, two weeks later, that

4

doesn't have the same -- he says, well, look, it's not

5

unconscionable, but it turns out it is, in his case.

6

And it would have to be -- the opinion would

7

have to clarify the law by saying, this is normally

8

unconscionable but we are going to say it's not here

9

because of this activity that is unlikely to happen.

10

MR. COAKLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, I believe

11

this would be part of the inquiry that a lawyer would be

12

faced in trying to prove the affirmative defense of bona

13

fide error in a legal situation, and that -- that would

14

be part of the good faith analysis, part of the

15

reasonable procedures that he would present to the

if they are wrong, then the lawyer has no bona fide

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Immediately upon being

Mr. Coakley, one of your

10

earlier statements confused me.

11

fact that TILA was amended in 1980 to provide that legal

12

errors are not covered by the TILA defense, and I think

13

you -- I think you describe that as -- as changing the

14

law to -- to provide that -- that legal errors were not

15

covered.

16

You relied upon the

But as I understood the situation, every

17

court of appeals to have construed TILA prior to 1980

18

had held that legal errors were not -- were not

19

included, as -- as your opponent says, they are not

20

included here.

21

affirmation of the judicial interpretation of the

22

language similar to the language here.

23
24
25

So the amendment to TILA was just an

Justice Scalia, there were

cases, although not court of appeals cases that JUSTICE SCALIA:

Every court of appeals to

construe it had held that mistakes of law were not

2

covered.

Is that accurate or not?

3

MR. COAKLEY:

That's correct.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, then -- then your

5

prior statement was very misleading.

6

MR. COAKLEY:

Well, to the extent that there

7

were two different -- two different analyses or

8

interpretations that had emerged before 1980 that led

9

the Congress to -- in 1980, enact or to amend TILA,

10

otherwise, as pointed out in the Herrera case in our

11

brief, if everything was so settled in 1980, why would

12

there be a need to clarify the definition of bona fide

13

error under TILA, and -- and if it was clarified in 1980

14

under the FDCPA, then why didn't they take the step and

15

clarify it in the FDCPA from 1980 to 2010, especially

16

when Congress -

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There is no basis for

18

saying that the amendment was overturning -- changing

19

the prior meaning of TILA.

20

that.

21

opinions, and all the courts of appeals have come out

22

the other way.

23

There is no basis for saying

All you had were just a few district court

MR. COAKLEY:

Your Honor, the -- the

24

Petitioner's position was that the case law was uniform

25

at the time, and our position is the case law was not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

44
1

uniform at the time.

2

opposite approach to the court of appeals decision on -

3

on TILA, and that is what led to Congress reacting in

4

1980 to specifically exclude legal error from the TILA

5

defense and has -- Congress has -

6

There were cases that had taken an

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But why doesn't that just

7

mean that Congress wants to confirm that the judges -

8

the majority of judges who -- who had held that it

9

didn't -- that errors of law were not a defense, that

10

they were right, it's not changing -- changing anything.

11

It's just confirming that the majority view is right.

12

MR. COAKLEY:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, the

13

case law says that the law has to be settled, and as we

14

pointed out in our brief, it was not settled, and the

15

courts, afterwards, have reflected that there was no

16

settlement, and that that's one of the reasons why the

17

error portion of the TILA bona fide error was -- was

18

clarified, as the Petitioner puts it, to say this

19

excludes any interpretations of legal -- of legal -- of

20

the legal interpretations of TILA.

21

And then there was no -- whether you call it

22

a clarification, whether you call it a ratification,

23

whether you call it an amendment, it doesn't matter,

24

Congress didn't then similarly amend the FDCPA to be

25

consistent with their --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, why wouldn't one

2

say, now, Congress has confirmed that the word in the

3

Truth and Lending Act means thus and so, Congress has

4

said that's what those words mean, and then go back to

5

the other statutes and say the same language was used,

6

so it means the same thing, the same thing that Congress

7

has just confirmed?

8
9

MR. COAKLEY:

Justice Ginsburg, I believe

that the -- the words "bona fide error" in the TILA

10

statute were being construed, although not by courts of

11

appeals, to reasonably read the bona fide error

12

encompasses legal error.

13

There was a change -- change -- a

14

clarification, whatever, in 1980, to specifically say,

15

bona fide error does not include legal interpretations

16

of TILA, and that was then never clarified, ratified, or

whatever, nothing was done to the FDCPA at that time,

MR. COAKLEY:

The statute doesn't refer to

10

procedures reasonably adapted.

13

Well, suppose that a lawyer

at a conclusion that is plainly incorrect, does not,

good faith.

understanding of this provision; is that correct?

And if I could follow up to Justice Scalia's
and Justice Ginsburg's query about the -- the -- and

10

Justice Sotomayor's -- about the interpretation of the

11

words "TILA" versus "FDCPA," I think a review of the

12

cases of the Seventh and Tenth Circuits is instructive

13

because the Seventh Circuit was one of the circuits

14

that, under TILA, had -- had interpreted the word to

15

mean clerical error only.

The Tenth Circuit -- and the

Now, today, under interpreting the FDCPA

this -- in this case?

4

differently?

5

Why would it treat them

MR. COAKLEY:

There -- there are

6

differences -- substantial differences, Justice Stevens,

7

in the TILA and in the FDCPA statute, starting with the

8

purposes of the statute, starting with the construction

9

of the statute, one, TILA has a criminal liability, TILA

10

has life lines that the debt collector doesn't have in

11

the FDCPA, TILA dealing -- is dealing with disclosure of

12

financial information, TILA has regulations, as opposed

13

to no regulations -

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I would think all -- which

15

way do these cut?

I mean, the fact that there is

16

criminal liability under TILA would seem to me to cut in

17

precisely the opposite direction.

provide excuses of bona fide errors of law, I would

think.

You would want to

Why -- am I missing something here?

20

MR. COAKLEY:

The -- no, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MR. COAKLEY:

I would think -

It's a -- it's a distinction

between why -- in trying to answer Justice Stevens'

question, it's a distinction why TILA would be

25

interpreted differently by the -- than the FDCPA.

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. COAKLEY:

JUSTICE STEVENS:

6

Justice Scalia expressed.

7

MR. COAKLEY:

Given -- well, given the

8

purpose of TILA, and TILA dealing with computational

errors, regulation C, Truth in Lending, they -- they

10

amend -- they amended TILA -- I mean, I'm sorry.

11

Originally TILA didn't have a bona fide error and then

12

they amended it so as to -- before it was enacted -- so

13

as to cover this area to provide for the computational

14

error.

15

and the like.

16

Because it's so fraught with mathematical errors

That is not the situation in the FDCPA.

And

17

that is precisely the reasoning that is the Seventh and

18

Tenth Circuit have noted, and the case of Frye that we

19

have cited in our brief has noted, as the distinction

20

between these two statutes, and why one could be

21

interpreted this way and the FDCPA could be reasonably

interpreted the other way.

the substance of your answer is that they are just two

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

which they are different would suggest you need the

MR. COAKLEY:

How many have asked?

I don't know how many have

that's the obvious solution to the problem, that -

until you hold they are not -- they are liable for

mistake of law, but anyone can write to the FTC ahead of

11

time and -- and get a safe harbor.

12

It's -- so I don't know what we could do to

I am not disputing that,

What I am basically saying is it

20

really doesn't make any difference, because the truth

21

with respect to the FTC and the safe harbor defense and

22

the FDCPA, that Mr. Jay does not argue that one is

23

superfluous to the other; the Petitioner argues that one

makes the other superfluous -- neither are superfluous

prospective or not?

give to the person who is asking?

22

going to be liable for a bona fide mistake, why would he

23

ever use it?

24
25

The point is what benefit does it

MR. COAKLEY:

If the person is not

Well, there are reasons why a

debt collector may use it if he has time and he needs

1

the prospective letter from the FTC.

2

debt collector's going to go to the bona fide error

3

because it's retrospective, although there is risk with

4

the bona fide error, because it's not the categorical

5

immunity that the safe harbor gives.

6

they're not inconsistent.

7

In -- in reality

And there's -

The safe harbor is not a --a statutory

8

interpretation why you should drive a meaning into the

9

bona fide error provision that is not apparent on its

10

face.

11

I would say in closing that Justice Breyer,

12

your -- your comments earlier are just right.

13

worse -- a reading, the safe harbor, reading the bona

14

fide error provision to exclude legal error is worse

15

than unfair.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

This is

Oh, now I do see -- which

17

is why I asked the question, I asked to get an answer,

18

and the answer now seems to be floating around the FTC

19

idea.

20

just wonder if the -- if the bar in this area, and their

21

clients, if they made an effort, might be able to get

22

the financing for the FTC so they could have enough

23

people to respond quickly to the letter.

It's -- seven letters, that isn't very much.

24

(Laughter.)

25

MR. COAKLEY:

Justice Ginsburg asked the

Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

question about unprecedented.

2

would really be unprecedented here would be for this

3

Court to construe the bona fide error defense so that a

4

lawyer or a debt collector who is giving advice to his

5

client to follow a particular way of action, and the law

6

was unsettled, for that lawyer to be subject to -- to be

7

punished for personal liability.

8

bona fide error clearly under Lamie encompasses -

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

the liability, aren't there?

11

isn't it a $1,000 limit?

12

MR. COAKLEY:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

And we think that the

There are severe limits on
Isn't there a thousand -

Yes, Your Honor.
That's not big bucks for an

attorney, is it?

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. COAKLEY:

17

In -- in truth, what

But let that -- well, maybe

for the prior group that was up here, but I don't -

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. COAKLEY:

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

class action, wasn't it?

22

action?

23

MR. COAKLEY:

It's big in Cleveland.
This isn't -- this is a

It was brought as a class

This is definitely a class

24

action.

This is a class action that wants all of the

25

validation notices that were sent out by this law firm

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

57
1

to -- that included the words "in writing" in it for

2

that period, and further than that, they wanted the

3

financial information from the law firm, the financials

4

because, under the class action provision, it's $500,000

5

or 1% of the net worth of the firm, which is ever less.

6

So the request was made of my client, give

7

me the financials of your law firm, and for some reason,

8

my client did, but this -- the statute was not meant to

9

punish lay debt collectors, including lawyers.

10

The bona fide error defense is the shield,

11

and we ask the court to affirm the judgment of the Sixth

12

Circuit Court of Appeals.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

The case is submitted.
