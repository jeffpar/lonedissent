ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. SADY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SADY:

9
10

Mr. -- Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

The phrase "term of imprisonment" appears

12

three times in the first sentence of the Federal good

13

time statute.

14

15

imposed."

16

time credit, also means the "sentence imposed" when it's

17

used in the phrase "up to 54 days of good time credit

18

towards the service of the sentence."

19

The first two times the parties are in

"Term of imprisonment" means "sentence
The third use, which sets the rate for good

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But it doesn't always mean

20

that.

I think you say somewhere in your brief that it

21

always means that.

22

Because in -- what is it, 3624 -- wait a minute, now.

23

3624(d) says that, "Upon the release of a prisoner on

24

the expiration of his term of imprisonment, the Bureau

25

of Prisons shall give him clothes, money and

It surely does not always mean that.

transportation."

2

Now there the expiration of his term of

3

imprisonment does not mean the -- the assigned term of

4

imprisonment.

5

imprisonment less all the good time credits he has had.

It means the assigned term of

6

MR. SADY:

Exactly.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Unless you think they are

8

supposed to give him his clothes, you know, several

9

months after he leaves.

10

MR. SADY:

Your Honor, that is a perfect use

11

of "term of imprisonment" to mean actual time and any

12

good time credits earned.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MR. SADY:

Right.

And it uses the term "release."

15

"Release" is defined in 3624(a), which says that you are

16

released when you have your actual time served and any

17

good time.

18

The flaw in the Bureau of Prisons system is

19

that they do not give credit towards the term of

20

imprisonment as this statute in 3624(b) dictates.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm not addressing that.

22

All I'm -- look, it -- the text says "upon the release

23

of a prisoner on the expiration of his term of

24

imprisonment."

25

to acknowledge that that is a use of the phrase "term of

My only point is that that -- you have

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

imprisonment" that does not mean the sentence he was

2

given, but rather means the sentence that he served.
MR. SADY:

3

I respectfully disagree because

4

it expires.

A term of imprisonment, a ten-year

5

sentence, expires.

6

that means it has expired, because you also are giving

7

those 54 days of good time credits 10 times.

When you have 311 days 10 times,

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's right.
But why isn't the term of

10

imprisonment most reasonably understood to mean the term

11

that is imposed viewed at the time when it is imposed?

12

So that if someone is sentenced to a term of 360 days, 5

13

years, and begins serving his sentence on January 1st,

14

year 1 of the term imposed ends on December 31st of that

15

year; year 2 of the term imposed begins on January 1st

16

of the following year, and so forth.

17

MR. SADY:

Justice Alito, that would be the

18

end of the time served for 1 year, but for the term of

19

imprisonment, because if we assume at the end of the

20

365 days that person has earned maximum good time

21

credit -­

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

23

MR. SADY:

Right.

That he should receive credit

24

towards the service of the sentence.

25

365th day he should move back on the calendar a

5
Alderson Reporting Company

That means on the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

adjustment for good time and a reset for the next year.

2

That way, if you have a ten-year sentence, you have ten

3

opportunities to -­

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, hang on.

I understand

5

what you are arguing, but I don't understand why the

6

term of imprisonment changes.

7

at the term of the imprisonment on the day when it is

8

imposed and the day when the defendant begins serving

9

the sentence, and you can say:

10

We look at the -- we look

Year one ends at the end

of 2010; year two ends at the end of 2011.
Why do you think that the term -- the phrase

11
12

"term of imprisonment" has to change as -- the

13

understanding of the "term of imprisonment" has to

14

change as the prisoner progresses in serving the

15

sentence?

I totally fail to understand that.
MR. SADY:

16

It doesn't change.

It's still -­

17

the two components of a term of imprisonment are actual

18

time and good time credits.

19

presenting it is the first year of the term of

20

imprisonment is the 311 days of actual service and the

21

54 days -­

22

So the way we are

JUSTICE ALITO:

But you don't know whether

23

that -- you don't know whether that prisoner is going to

24

be eligible for the 54 days until the 365 days are over.

25

MR. SADY:

That's fine.

6
Alderson Reporting Company

We -- if the Bureau

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of Prisons determines that the person should receive up

2

to 54 days at day 365, then they receive credit towards

3

the service of their sentence.

4

back 54 days because they didn't have to serve those

5

days.

That means moving it

And then you reset -­

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I'm not sure where you

7

get that -- I'm not sure where you get that out of the

8

statute.

9

question.

10

But I still don't think you have answered my
I don't want to belabor it too much.
On the day when the prisoner in my

11

hypothetical begins serving his sentence, if you said,

12

When will your first year of imprisonment -- first year

13

of your term of imprisonment end?

14

December 31st, 2010.

15

term of imprisonment end?

16

what you would have to say at that point, because you

17

don't know whether the prisoner will earn any good time

18

credits.

19

year of the term of imprisonment changes as the sentence

20

goes on?

21

You would say

When will the second year of the

That's

So why do you think that the meaning of the

I do -- do not think it changes.

I think that it is adjusted for good time, which is

exactly what Congress intended.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, I'm -- perhaps

3

I can, if you will permit me, rephrase Justice Alito's

4

question in sort of the more simplistic way I looked at

5

it.

6

Why is it that we have to do the calculation

7

that you're talking about, which is start at 311 days

8

and take back days, which makes no sense to me, or their

9

very complicated ten-page number?

10

Why can't they just take 54 days at the end

11

of every year that there is actual service, and that the

12

time served, plus whatever number of days have been

13

earned, you subtract it from the term of imprisonment?

14

So if he was imprisoned for 10 years, he got 540 days

15

for whatever it is.

16

up whatever -- you added up 9 times 54, and you took it

17

away from 10.

18

sense of "beyond the time served" language that's in

19

this provision.

At the end of the 9th year, he made

He serves 9 and that.

MR. SADY:

20

That would make

Justice Sotomayor, we are not

21

asking -- 311 doesn't have to be the magic day of when

22

they determine whether they should receive it.

23

saying, go ahead, assume exactly what they are doing

24

now.

25

We are

Go up to 365 days.
But they do make a determination.

8
Alderson Reporting Company

At that

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

point of making the determination, that's when they go

2

back to 54 days and have to reset.

3

10-year sentence you have 10 blocks that Congress

4

intended to give prisoners to be able to earn 54 days in

5

each of those blocks.

6

That way on a

Now, the way that we were hearing it posited

7

from Justice Alito, if we have the 54 days on top of

8

time served without any adjustment, then we end up with

9

a 419-year first day -- first year, and you can only fit

10
11

8 opportunities to earn the 54 days.
JUSTICE ALITO:

No, not at all.

No.

At the

12

end of -- at the end of 2010, in my hypothetical, you

13

would take the 54 days off the end, just as Justice

14

Sotomayor suggested.

15

MR. SADY:

And the -­

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

And -- but it doesn't mean

17

that the service doesn't -- your -- your argument is

18

predicated on the idea that service of year two begins

19

on the 311th day.

20

MR. SADY:

If there is an adjustment for

21

good time, because "term of imprisonment" is a term of

22

art that doesn't mean time served only.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

It can mean -­

But I don't understand that.

24

I will not belabor it.

I don't understand why the

25

parties have spent so much time sparring over that

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

issue, which seems to me to be totally unnecessary and

2

irrelevant.
MR. SADY:

3

Justice Alito, if I could refer

4

you to 3621(a), 3624(a), and 3624(b), each of those

5

refers -- when they are talking about a term of

6

imprisonment, each refers to it as "less good time."

7

And -- and unless you do that, the reason -­

8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
you take (a), and (a) says:

Well, do you do it if

A prisoner shall be

10

released by the Bureau of Prisons on the date of the

11

expiration of the prisoner's term of imprisonment -- 10

12

years, we are assuming, an imprisonment -- less any time

13

credited towards the service of the prisoner's sentence,

14

as provided in subsection (b).

15

MR. SADY:

Exactly.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So each year that he

17

served, you add up the number of days he has served, the

18

good time credit, and you subtract them from the

19

120 months that you have given him, and you figure out

20

when he's going to get out.

21

forward, the way everyone seems to be doing.
MR. SADY:

22

You work backwards, not

If you do that, you only end up

23

with eight opportunities to -- to have 54 days.

24

why it's the difference between -- I think anybody

25

reading -­

10
Alderson Reporting Company

That's

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that's the way the

2

language is written.

3

opportunity, but it says by its explicit phrase:

4

At the date of the prisoner's -- expiration of the

5

prisoner's term of imprisonment, take that day and

6

subtract from it time credited towards the service of

7

the prisoner's sentence.

8
9

11

So I mean you may want the greater

MR. SADY:
phrase is:

Terms:

We are going to -- the rate

Up to 54 days at the end of each year of the

term of imprisonment.
If there is a 10-year term of imprisonment,

12

that means there's 10 opportunities to earn 54 days.

13

The Bureau of Prisons' math ends up with 470 days,

14

70 days less.

15

not interpret "term of imprisonment" to encompass the

16

possibility of good time.

17

And the reason for that is that they do

21

But the -- actually, the very good idea that Congress

22

had was that you had an incentive at every stage of your

23

term of imprisonment for good behavior.

Then it's 311.

But maybe you

Then it would be a 365-block.

24

Even if you were misbehaving early in your

prison term, at the end you still have the opportunity

It counts

This Court has never found that phrases -­

7

two phrases, uses of "term of imprisonment" in the same

8

sentence, mean different things.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What do you do with -­

10

if -- it's a very short sentence?

11

your view, is a year and a day less 54.

12

MR. SADY:

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

Yes.

MR. SADY:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20
21
22

With 360 -­
Yes.

If -- suppose it's

for -- just -- the whole sentence is 360 days.
MR. SADY:

18
19

But 360 days, what do you

do with that?

15

17

A year and a day, in

If it says 366 days, so that the

year -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, 360.

In other words,

short of a year.
MR. SADY:

Then it -- a 360-day sentence

23

would not be eligible, because we -- the parties are

24

agreed that "term of imprisonment" means a sentence of

25

more than a year.

So it has to be more than 365 days.

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So the person that gets a

2

year and a day serves less than the person that gets

3

less than a year?

4

MR. SADY:

That is correct.

And district

5

courts frequently address that problem.

When you have a

6

relatively short sentence, you say:

7

give us -- instead of an 11-month sentence, could you

8

give us a year and a day sentence, so that you could

9

earn the good time on that?

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Judge, could you

How can you earn the good

11

time?

I mean you only earn the good time if -- if you

12

are a good prisoner for a year.

13

MR. SADY:

That gets us to the -­

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you are going to let him

15

out 54 days before the year, even though he hasn't

16

earned the good time in the year?

17

MR. SADY:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

He has.
What did he do?

How has

he?
MR. SADY:

20

He has because of the last

21

sentence in 3624(b) that says that for the last year or

22

portion of the year, that you go ahead and establish the

23

two-step process.

24

release date, which is a release date with maximum good

25

time.

First, you figure out the projected

Then you make the decision about whether the

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

prisoner should receive that within six weeks of that -­

2

of that projected release date.

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but that still

4

couldn't give him the full 54 days, because there's only

5

42 days in six weeks.

6

MR. SADY:

That's only a measure when you

7

make the determination.

They -- they were recognizing

8

that for the last period of time, or for a year and a

9

day sentence, that you are not going to be able to do

10

the time all the time, but you will, so that's why there

11

is a special mechanism at the end.

12
13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

mechanism can't give the full 54 days.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

16
17

But I'm saying the special

Exactly.
Because they don't make it

until 42 days before the end of the sentence.
MR. SADY:

They make it until 311 days at

18

the end of the sentence, because what they do is they

19

make the -- they figure out what the maximum good time

20

would be, which would be 312 days on a 300 and -- on a

21

year and a day sentence, and they make that

22

determination earlier.

23

They say, okay, you have been good for that

24

period of time.

We recognize that this is going to be a

25

problem, the same problem you would have on a sentence

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of 10 years and 6 months, where you have to prorate the

2

credit, 27 days instead of 54, half, and then figure out

3

the projected release date with 180 days, subtract the

4

27 days, and then make the determination sometime within

5

the 6 weeks up to that last point.

6

So that there is a mechanism for

7

understanding that it is -- that in the last year there

8

is going -- going to be an assumption that if you are

9

behaving all the way up to -- in the full sentence -­

10
11

day 311, you should get the full 54 days.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sure there is

12

something wrong with this predicate to this question,

13

but the -- the statute allows the Bureau to make a

14

determination of good time credit within 15 days after

15

the end of each year of the sentence.

16

MR. SADY:

Yes.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They cannot make

18

that determination within 15 days of the 311 days.

19

so "each year of the sentence" must mean each -- the

20

full year, the 365 days.

21

MR. SADY:

And

Our position is that the Bureau

22

of Prisons can make its determination as it pleases.

23

We -- we are asking the Court to do -- to construe a

24

statute, not write a policy statement.

25

that there are going to be some mechanics of it.

15
Alderson Reporting Company

So we understand
But

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the mechanics in this work very easily with the

2

assurance that they are receiving good time credit

3

against the period of the sentence imposed by the judge.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You treat each year

5

of the sentence as the 311 days if there has been good

6

behavior, no?

7

MR. SADY:

Not necessarily.

We are --

8

I'm -- if the Bureau of Prisons wants to make that

9

determination at day 365, that's fine, as long as they

10

adjust by doing exactly what the statute says:

11

towards the service of the sentence, move it back 40 -­

12

54 days, and then reset.

13

blocks of 365 days.

If you do that, you have 10

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

Credit

I mean you read it.

Well, why do you do have to

15

do that?

It so complicated.

Just

16

reading this, I -- I think the language should say this:

17

10 years, he's got a 10-year sentence.

18

the first year you write the number 54 on a piece of

19

paper if he has done well.

At the end of

20

Suppose he comes in on January 1, okay?

21

January 2, after the first year, you write the word

22

50 -- the number 54.

23

the time you get to the year 8, what you have done is

24

you have got 432 days.

25

And you do that each year.

And by

So then you subtract the 430 days from 10

16
Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

years, and what you get is you are 67 days short of 9

2

years.

3

you do is you take 67 days, subtract that from 365, and

4

you've got 298, and you simply prorate for those 298.

5

And you subtract that, too, so he gets another 10 days

6

or so, or 15 days credit, and that's it.

7

So now you look at the last sentence, and what

And that's following the statute, it seems

8

to me, absolutely literally.

9

make sense, because you don't want to give him credit

10

And it also seems to me to

for time he never serves.
MR. SADY:

11

Justice Breyer, I think it

12

doesn't make sense, because what it does is it creates

13

an 87.2 minimum sentence that is served, and we note

14

that the sentencing table upon which every Federal

15

sentence is predicated is based on 85 percent.

16

being -­

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

That

No, that isn't what the -­

18

if you want to know what the sentencing commission did,

19

I think the best evidence of that is you read the

20

introduction to the guidelines.

21

introduction to the guidelines says is that, roughly

22

speaking, many of the sentences approximate the time

23

actually served before.

And what the

24

Now, what to me that suggests is that the

25

sentencing commission never considered this question.

Alderson Reporting Company

And if there's something more specific than that, that

2

shows they did, I would like to know what it is, because

3

I don't trust memory.

4

MR. SADY:

Your Honor, we are relying very

5

heavily on the supplemental report at -- at page 140 of

6

the joint appendix that says we -- we divide it by .85

in order to calibrate the sentencing table to include

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

Of course, the government

12

contends it's none of the sentencing commission's

13

business.

14

the government's position?

It's up to the Bureau of Prisons.

MR. SADY:

15

Isn't that

That is their position.

And our

16

position is that it's -- administering the statute is

17

the Bureau of Prisons's business, but deciding what the

18

minimum sentence that can -- minimum time that can be

19

served to satisfy a term of imprisonment is a policy

20

decision, and that the policy is properly placed -­

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

But there is nothing in

22

there -- that's not a policy statement; that's not a

23

guideline.

conclusion, I think, is conflicting with what it says in

that all of this was very approximate.

2

how -- how -- a court would be bound by that.
MR. SADY:

3

I don't see

I think that the court could be

4

advised by it in terms of knowing that we are looking at

5

a harsher sentence.

6

-- the sentence that the judge imposed was -- whether it

7

was advisory guidelines or mandatory guidelines, the

8

sentencing table provided the initial baseline.

Everybody is serving more time than

9

And that initial baseline was boosted by 2.2

10

percent, which is not an insignificant amount, and there

11

is a very simple way for the court to construe the

12

statute consistently throughout to conform the two, so

13

that people are not serving 2.2 percent more time in

14

custody than the sentencing table that every judge uses

15

in imposing their sentence.
We are institutionalizing a harsher system

16
17

in a way that doesn't meet the statutory language,

18

because the statutory language says "term of

19

imprisonment."
And if it's term of imprisonment, 10 years

20
21

of a term of imprisonment, I think a reasonable plain

22

meaning is that you have 10 opportunities to earn

23

54 days.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Sady, you -- you said

something about 15 percent or 85 percent is a more

19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

workable system than -- was it 12.9 percent?

2

Do we have any information on, (A), the

3

number of Federal prisoners who get good time and in

4

that universe, the ones who get good time, how many get

5

the full credit and how many get something less than the

6

full 54 days?

7

MR. SADY:

Justice Ginsburg, there are

8

approximately 200,000 prisoners, and of those about

9

195,000 of them are eligible for good time credits.

10

My anecdotal experience is that most

11

prisoners get most of the -- the good time credits, so

12

it's not at all unusual for prisoners to achieve most of

13

that.

14

is a relatively smaller number, at least in my

15

experience, who do not get a lot of it.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

There is some that have minor amounts, and there

Is this right?

I'm -- I'm

17

sorry to ask you this question, but I get lost in the

18

math of this sometimes.

20

know, with the 9 years you go and put it on a piece of

21

paper?

MR. SADY:

Yes, the 419 -­

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

I take it what you want is

24

you, in -- in essence, want him to get credit for

25

54 days for that tenth year?

20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. SADY:

Yes.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

And the argument

3

against that, reading the language and so forth, is,

4

well, look this is an imaginary 10th year.

5

6

released sometime late in year 8.

7

add 54 days?

8

because sentences are awfully long, but -- but why would

9

anybody want to add 54 days in respect to a year that's

10

He is not

He is going to be
And so why should we

I mean maybe it would be a nice thing

never going to be served?
MR. SADY:

11

Each year is served in the -- if

12

you take away the 54 days, if you credit it towards the

13

service of the sentence and do the adjustment and reset

14

that we are asking the Court to do so that you have 10

15

opportunities, then in the last year, you are -- when

16

you are in -- you go to the last sentence that

17

acknowledges that you are going to have to make some

18

arbitrary time that you are going to, say, okay, we are

19

going to decide that you have done well enough that you

20

are going to be able to get the full credit for the last

21

year.

22

But the flaw in the Bureau of Prisons is by

23

having the 54 days and actual time and that that's what

24

happens at the first year, that's a 419-day first year.

25

You can only squeeze 8 of those in.

Excuse me.
Is it day 365, or is it day

311?

13

MR. SADY:

It depends.

And the reason it

14

depends is because the language of the statute says

15

"credit toward the service of prisoner's sentence beyond

16

time served," so if you do it beyond time served and you

17

give him credit towards that sentence -- the Bureau of

18

Prisons is making a determination.

their determination, and we respect that determination,

we then have to go -- from the 365th day, back, because

-- we never considered it

time because the language was different.

25

But now that you had have got this language

now, it's hard to reconcile with that first year.

12

the sentence at the end, as you pointed out about the

proration.

it says -- starts by saying is, if you are serving a

sentence of longer than a year you are eligible for good

time credit.

through that first year.

So when the -- when the statute says, what

On the hypothetical -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There is a premise flaw

there.

And that premise flaw is that you have told us

4

that you don't earn the credit until the end of the

5

year.

6

MR. WALL:

Well -­

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So your answer about

8

this probation is not an answer, because it's -- your

9

premise is not the same.

10

MR. WALL:

That's why for each full year

11

served, so for a 10-year sentence, you are right that

12

you are making a determination at the end of the year

13

for the first 8 years, but when you get to that ninth

14

year, as Justice Breyer pointed out -­

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm not worried about

16

sentences that are more than 2 years.

17

the prisoner who is sentenced to a year and a day.

18

does that proration help that individual, since they are

19

not going to get the good time credit until they've

20

served a year?

21

MR. WALL:

I'm worried about
How

So, the way this works is that

22

for the prisoner sentenced to a year and a day or

23

13 months or 14 months, because they are receiving

24

credit through that first year, their good time credit

25

brings them below a year.

They'll never serve a full

earned back for each year, and you take it off the full

term of imprisonment.

5

The -- you are representing to me that the

6

math that is in your program statement is accomplishing

7

that result?

8

MR. WALL:

Absolutely.

Which is to say when

9

the prisoner gets to his last year, if that's a partial

10

year, he is not going to get the 54 days, he's going to

11

get some portion of the 54 days, based on what part of a

May I just interrupt with

one question?

is, he should never enter the 9th year because he would

19

finish the 10-year sentence in less than 8 years.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

22

Well -­
Or less than 9 years,

rather.
MR. WALL:

23

That's -- that's right.

540

24

wouldn't be quite 2 years, but setting that to the

25

side -­

30

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So how does he -- how does

2

he get his 10th block of good time?

3

get it under your -­

4

MR. WALL:

How does he ever

Well, under the government's view

5

he can only earn good time credit when he is actually

incarcerated.

7

saying -­

8
9
10

And what Petitioners are coming in and

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Right.

I understand.

But

explain to me how -- how he can get more than a year of
good time credit before the 10th year begins?
MR. WALL:

11

Well, so, if you take a 10-year

12

prisoner -- a prisoner with a 10-year sentence, the way

13

it currently works, at the end of the 8th year he has

14

accrued 432 days of good time credit.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

16

MR. WALL:

Right.

Which is more than a year.
So he knocked off his

17

full 10th year and he's knocked off a part of his 9th

So the -- the

Petitioners here, Petitioner Barber, for instance, has

been incarcerated for over 17 years.

7

of his 17 years in prison, he has gotten 54 days of

credit.

I want 54 days for every year of my sentence

11
12

as imposed by the court, not as served by me behind

13

bars, and that's what doesn't track the language of the

14

statute.

15

Justice Alito pointed out, is to read "year" to mean

16

311 days, and it is no answer to say, as Petitioners do,

17

well, you can do the determination whenever.

18

are saying is at the end of a 311-day period, you should

19

determine whether the prisoner gets the credit.

What they

But what the statute says is the

20
21

determination itself has to occur at the end of the

because you haven't made the determination yet.

So you can't fold the 54 days into the year

JUSTICE ALITO:
them to be saying that.

I understood them to be saying

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that the determination could be made at the end of

2

365 days, but if it's determined that the prisoner is

3

entitled to 54 days of credit, then year 1 should be

4

regarded as having begun on the 312th day, rather than

5

the 366th day.

6

MR. WALL:

I think that's right, which first

7

it is inconsistent with the language of the statute,

8

But it also sets up a very odd

On Petitioner's approach, it seems to me,

13

14

example, he says, well, you can do it on the 365th day.

15

Well, if the prisoner's misbehaved on day 340, is that

16

coming out of the first year or out of the second year.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Now, but take the

Well, I think that they

18

would say you won't know when the second year has begun

19

until the full calendar year has been completed.

20

MR. WALL:

And I guess the -- the difficulty

21

with that approach is that it seems to me that once the

22

311-day cycle is finished, you have to start a new

23

311-day cycle on day 312.

The bureau does do it by looking at what

That is the

over these 311-day cycles, and if you -- you know, you

10

For prisoners sentenced subject to the SRA,

11

which was in effect from 1987 to 1994, you are right.

12

And that is the SRA according to your brief.

13

Their credit vests.

That vesting

requirement was eliminated in the PLRA, which governs

prisoner's sentences since 1986.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So for the vast bulk

Mr. Wall, the -- if we

20

consider both methods plausible, the number comes out at

21

15 percent -- 85 percent, 15 percent.

22

workable number, and there are some hints in the

23

legislative history that Congress thought 85 percent,

24

not 87.2 or whatever it is.

25

It's a more

So in choosing between those two methods,

38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

why not take the easier number to work with?
MR. WALL:

Well, two reasons.

I think to

3

the extent that you are suggesting the statute is

4

ambiguous, the Bureau of Prisons is charged by Congress

5

with administering the statute in both Reno v. Koray and

6

Lopez v. Davis.

7

interpretation of other prisoner credit statutes.

8

think the bureau is equally entitled to the same

9

discretion here to interpret this statute.

10

This Court deferred to the bureau's

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We

We -- if we disagree with

11

that, if we disagree that the BOP has authority in this

12

area, then -- as Justice Ginsburg's question, I think,

13

suggests -- does not the Rule of Lenity apply?

14

MR. WALL:

Well, this Court's been clear -­

15

and I -- I can't put it any better than Justice

16

Sotomayor did in her first opinion in Sash -- that this

17

is not a criminal statute.

18

criminal prohibition on conduct nor -­

19
20

It neither imposes a

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
the Granderson case?

21

MR. WALL:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

23

MR. WALL:

24
25

Well, how do you explain

I'm sorry?
The Granderson case.

I'm not familiar with that case,

Justice Kennedy.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I had thought that in that

39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

case, Justice Ginsburg, for this Court, established the

2

proposition that the Rule of Lenity is applicable.

3

know it wasn't cited in the Petitioner's brief, either.

4

That was a parole revocation case.

5

I

But in -- in any event, the -- shouldn't the

6

Rule of Lenity apply?

If the Rule of Lenity is thought

7

of as a notice requirement insofar as giving you warning

8

to what conduct is punishable, that's one thing, but

9

doesn't the Rule of Lenity mean more than that?

It's a

10

check against the power of the State, so that you simply

11

mitigate the -- the power of the State in favor of the

12

individual.

13

Lenity.

14

In a case like this, apply the Rule of

MR. WALL:

I think it's a check against the

15

power of the State when it's penalizing conduct or when

16

it's putting forth a penalty for a criminal prohibition.

17

But in both Koray and Lopez, this Court was considering

18

what prisoner credit statutes meant, other prisoner

19

credit statutes.

20

of those, it deferred to the bureau's interpretation.

21

And in both, it specifically rejected application of the

22

Rule of Lenity.

23

18 U.S.C. 3585 and 3621.

And in both

And I think the notion there is that this

24

statute is not a criminal statute.

25

administrative reward for compliance with institutional

Alderson Reporting Company

It's about an

regulations.

2

prohibition on conduct where the penalty that someone is

3

sentenced to by a court once they have been convicted of

4

a criminal offense -­

5

And that's different from setting forth a

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, the Granderson case

6

is cited in the brief for the National Association Of

7

Criminal Defense Lawyers, and as I read it, it applies

8

to this area and it seems to me that it ought to.

9

I mean, you tell us this is not a criminal

10

statute.

11

the impact and force of the State detaining a person for

12

a criminal act.

13

I -- I certainly think it has -- it has all

MR. WALL:

Well, it is a statute that

14

determines in some sense how long you will be in prison,

15

so I take your point.

16

the penalty applicable to the conduct, but by offering

17

an administrative reward; sort of relieving you of part

18

of the burden of that -- that penalty.

19

But it does so not by extending

And I am not aware of any case -- and I am

20

obviously not familiar with Granderson, but I am not

21

aware of any case from this Court, or indeed any lower

22

court, finding that section 3624 is a criminal statute,

23

as this Court's cases uses the term.

another consideration?

No, but isn't there

It's not the Rule of Lenity, but

41
Alderson Reporting Company

2

it's something else we should take into account.
In the -- in their reply brief, they say it

3

costs about 25 or $26,000 to house a particular

4

prisoner, and the number of prisoners involved is -­

something like $100 million in taxpayers' money is at

issue in this case.

It -- is -- you don't disagree with

MR. WALL:

I'm -- I think the basis for that

is just math that the Petitioners have done.

I don't

have any independent basis for confirming or denying it.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

But in any event, it's

12

clear it's a lot of money.

13

factor that we should be aware of in this case, because,

14

all other things being equal -- assume the statute is

15

totally ambiguous, and if you -- if one -- one -- one

16

version will save the -- the government $100 million a

17

year and the other version will cost it, is that -­

18

isn't that a factor we -- we should take into

19

consideration?

20

MR. WALL:

And -- and is that not a

I think it's a factor that the

21

bureau could, should and has taken into consideration in

22

the developing its interpretation as the agency in

charge of administering the statute.

Let's call that time you are talking about, that

Okay.

21

in.

Now, you are saying don't

And he's saying let's put some

22

Now, the strong -- a strong argument, I

23

think, for his is the following -- think about that

24

first year.

25

54 days, subtract it, everybody seems to agree we get to

That first year we are going to calculate

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the number 311, right?

2

But if you were to apply the last sentence

3

to that first year, the prorating sentence, you wouldn't

4

get 54.

5

like that.

6

Prisons system that it is 54.

7

respect to the first year, they are calculating phantom

8

time, i.e., not the first year, but a person who had a

9

sentence to a year and a day.

You would get like 45 days, or 47 or something
But everybody agrees under the Bureau of
And, therefore, in

If you had a sentence to

10

a year and a day, you agree it's 54 days, and everybody

11

agrees with that, and that includes phantom time.
So he said, well, if you include it for the

12
13

first year, since the statute says nothing about the

14

first year, why not include it for the other years, too?

15

How can you possibly justify phantom time being included

16

in the first year but not in the other years?

17

MR. WALL:

Justice Breyer, I disagree with

18

your premise.

19

eligible for credit, but because that person is accruing

20

credit as he serves, he will never actually get 54 days.

21

By the time he gets to the 319th day, he has accrued

22

47 days of credit, those combine to equal his 366-day

23

sentence.

24
25

Someone sentenced to a year and a day is

JUSTICE BREYER:

So, in other words, they

don't let him out under 311?

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. WALL:

That's -- that's exactly -­

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

In other words, the Bureau

3

of Prisons for a person whose has a sentence of a year

4

and a day does not let him out 54 days short, rather

5

they let him out 47 days short, because they apply the

6

last sentence in the prorating of that sentence?

7
8

MR. WALL:
with Petitioner's view.

9
10

Exactly.

What Petitioner -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is that -- is that what

MR. WALL:

Yes.

happens?

11
12

And that's exactly our difference

Yes.

He is released after

the 319th day.

13

And I think what Petitioners actually want

14

is phantom time even in the first year.

15

saying is fine, he may only serve 311 days, 312 days,

16

319 days, we want the full 54.

17

him out at 319, back him up to 312, we want the phantom

18

week in the first year.

19

What they are

So, instead of letting

And, so, I think the way the bureau

20

interprets it, there is no phantom time in any year.

21

The way the Petitioners interpret it, there is phantom

22

time in every year, no matter the length of the

23

sentence.

As I said I think it creates a gap in

24

coverage.

It rests on this assumption that prisoners

25

are always getting 54 days.

That is just not the case.

45
Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you disagree with your

2

colleague that that is the case most of the time, that

3

most Federal prisoners get good time credit, and of the

4

ones who get credit, most of them get the full 54 days?

5

MR. WALL:

There are no statistics on this,

6

but, yes, Justice Ginsburg, I think the majority of

7

prisoners do earn the full credit, certainly these

8

Petitioners have.

9

15 to 20 percent Federal prisoner who tend to be repeat

10

offenders, and they are often being docked to good time

11

credit.

But I would say that there are, say,

12

So, I think what you will see is that the

13

ones getting 54 days do it consistently, and the ones

14

not getting 54 days, often do that pretty consistently.

15

And, you know, the difficulty on Petitioner's method is

16

that no matter when you want to do that calculation,

17

Petitioners at bottom are saying what you should be

18

looking at is a 311-day period, and you take the

19

311 days served, you take the 54 days of credit, and

20

together they give you a year of the sentence imposed.

21

And not only does that not serve penological

22

interest, as the bureau has found, but it just doesn't

23

track the language of the statute, which says during

24

each year you have got to comply with the regulations.

25

The statute cares not just about your conduct from days

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

1 to 311, but your conduct from day 312 to 365.

2

those days are equal in the statute's eyes.

3

54 days of credit knocked off the back end of your

4

sentence, you have got to behave and comply with the

5

rules for a full year each time you want the credit.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, did they exercise

10

MR. WALL:

As the pen declaration makes

11

clear, and this is at page 154 of the Joint Appendix,

12

when the bureau promulgated its rule in 1997, it did

13

that based on the statutory language and on making a

14

policy choice to accommodate penological interest,

15

ensuring that credit would always be an incentive to

16

good behavior and providing clear notice to inmates of

17

their projected release dates.

18

the government has -­

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, I think -- you know,

We have never given

20

deference, have we, to an affidavit submitted in

21

litigation to explain something that on its face is not

22

explained either in an agency's regulation or in its

23

deference to an affidavit.

25

MR. WALL:

Well, it's giving deference to

48
Alderson Reporting Company

the rule, because the affidavit informs the court that

2

the rule is an exercise of the bureau's discretion.

MR. WALL:

Justice Scalia, I think it is

2

different because that would be broadside in Overton

Park.

4

enough in the agency action itself to enable judicial

review, the right answer is not to set it aside, the

right answer is to send it back to the agency to let the

did.

And what this Court said is if there is not

course here, the agency has already done that.

12

the rare circumstances where we don't need to remand on

MR. WALL:

(Laughter.)

MR. WALL:

I -- I -­

My only point, Justice Scalia,

4

was that whether you get there by deferring to the rule

5

or by deferring to the program statement, as the court

6

of appeals did, every court of appeals to consider it

7

has come out in the same place, which is that by hook or

8

by crook, the bureau has exercised its discretion to

9

answer this question.

10

And I -­

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You say there are 195,000

11

sentences affected by this rule.

12

that cuts.

13

time in -- you know, significantly more time in jail

14

than they should, that's kind of troublesome.

If there are 195,000 people spending more

MR. WALL:

15

I don't know which way

Justice Stevens, I think what I

16

would say is the bureau has been doing it the same way

17

since 1987.

18

times in the last 20 years.

19

the bureau's methods.

Congress has amended this statute five
It has never moved to alter

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the cumulated -­

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Probably they didn't

22

understand it because it's an awfully hard statute to

23

understand.

24

MR. WALL:

Justice Stevens, with all

respect, Justice Breyer got it in the first 5 minutes.

JUSTICE SCALIA:
it!

Even Justice Breyer has got

Whoa!

7

(Laughter.)

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

Well, he's a lot smarter

But what -- what we

were -- what we were saying, is this is 36,000 years of

10

prisoner time, I mean -- 36,000, that is older than

11

Marbury versus Madison.

12

MR. WALL:

Justice Kennedy, that's true.

I

13

think the point is that the language of the statute has

14

remained unchanged, and for the last 20 years the bureau

15

has interpreted that in a reasonable way.

16

is unambiguous, but even if it weren't, at least the

17

bureau's interpretation is reasonable, which is why 11

18

courts of appeals have deferred to it.

19

The language

And so I take your point that they are

20

serving more time than under Petitioner's

21

interpretation, but I don't think that that policy

22

rationale is properly before this Court.

23

before the bureau, which has found that policy

24

consideration outweighed by other penological interests,

25

and I think that's the judgment to which this Court

53
Alderson Reporting Company

It is properly

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

should defer, not its own judgment about how much time

2

these prisoners should -- should be serving.
And I do think it's important in that regard

3
4

that Congress has returned the statute several times.

5

And I take your point that it is complicated, Justice

6

Stevens, but -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You can finish

the -­
MR. WALL:

-- but Congress has made a number

10

of technical amendments and I don't think there is any

11

evidence it did not understand of how this longstanding

12

system works.

Thank you.

Mr. Sady, you have 4 minutes remaining.

Thank you, Mr. Wall.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. SADY

17

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

18

MR. SADY:

Thank you.

19

The -- the idea that there could be time at

20

the end of the sentences is premised on "term of

21

imprisonment" mean "time served," which it cannot mean

22

in the same sentence where it says "beyond time served."

23

If you make the adjustment for good time

24

credit that is earned at the end of the year, it is

25

credit towards the service of the sentence; that means

54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that it's blocks of 365 days, that at the last day of

2

Mr. Barber's sentence if it's properly computed, he

3

would be looking at 365 days.

4

close to the end, if we go to the last statute that says

5

prorate the remaining period of time, the 30 -­

6

remaining 36 days he could earn, and credit it in the

7

last 6 weeks, because they are doing that simply as an

8

administrative technique.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If he behaved well until

Just so -- in your

10

system they do the measurement at the end of the

11

365 days.

12

for that reason, I'm only going to give you 10 days of

13

full time -- of good time credit.

14

MR. SADY:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

He misbehaves on the 340th day.

And they say

Yes.
So now your year starts

at 350?

17

MR. SADY:

355.

Yes.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, they said they are

19

only giving you 10 days of good time credit.

20

the end of -- 355.

21

MR. SADY:

Right.

22

(Laughter.)

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because at

And so the 355 -­

That was pretty bad.

355.

55
Alderson Reporting Company

Now, your year

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

starts again on 355 days -­

2

MR. SADY:

365, and if he behaves very badly

3

he has to go all the way to the end of that 365 and

4

doesn't get any adjustment, but if he -- next year he

5

starts all over again for 365 days, and if he is very

6

good he gets the 54 days.

7

If I could address the question that was

8

raised by Justice Ginsburg on the Rule of Lenity.

I

9

would like to point out that in the -- we have relied on

10

both R.L.C. and in -- on Granderson for your

11

articulation of the Rule of Lenity as it would apply in

12

this case.

13

other -- the statute, the history, the context, and if

14

we cannot -- if we apply the Rule of Lenity, if the

15

government's position cannot be shown to be

16

unambiguously correct, we have at least ambiguity here,

17

and then we go to Chief Justice Marshall's seminal

18

discussion of lenity.

19

Which, if after we're looking at all the

And what he said was that we look at lenity

20

for the proposition -- to back the principle that the

21

power of punishment belongs to the legislative

22

department; and the tenderness of the law for the rights

23

of individuals, both of -­

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the argument -- one

of the arguments is it is not punishment at all.

56
Alderson Reporting Company

This

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

is a reward; this is a reward for good behavior.
MR. SADY:

The Court in -- in Lynce and in

3

Weaver used the term "increase in punishment" when there

4

was no longer available good time credit.

5

that somebody has to serve 87.2 percent of the term of

6

imprisonment imposed by the judge instead of 85 percent,

7

that is imprisonment.

8
9

For -- to say

For Mr. Barber that's over 6 months'
additional time behind bars in a prison.

That's -­

10

that's penal; that is affecting individual liberty, it's

11

the type of liberty that was intended to be covered by

12

the Rule of Lenity; and especially in the situation

13

where the initial sentence was imposed based on a grid

14

that was calibrated assuming 85 percent, he's ending up

15

serving 2.2 percent more time than the sentencing judge,

16

in imposing the sentence.

17

And in actual raw time behind bars in a prison.

So that aspect of punishment.
