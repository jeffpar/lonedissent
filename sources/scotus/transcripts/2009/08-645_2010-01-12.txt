CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We’ll hear argument

Ms. Howe.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF AMY HOWE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MS. HOWE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The Hague Convention exists to ensure that

11

custody disputes are resolved by the courts of the

12

country of habitual residence rather than through

13

abduction.

14

child who is abducted in violation of a right of

15

custody.

16

require that the child reside in the country of

17

habitual residence, thereby rendering international

18

abduction illegal.

It thus generally requires the return of a

So too, a ne exeat right permits a parent to

Ne exeat rights are not only rights of

19
20

custody under the text of the convention, but they

21

also track the convention's vital purpose of ensuring

22

that children are not subject to international

23

abduction.

24
25

Under the convention, Mrs. Abbott cannot
evade the jurisdiction of the Chilean courts by
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

abducting the child to Texas and then asking a Texas

2

State court to nullify the rights granted to Mr.

3

Abbott under Chilean law.

4

the great majority of signatory courts to consider the

5

issue as well as essential authorities in both the

6

United States and Chile.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That’s the sound view of

How many -You would be on

9

absolutely sound ground if this were a convention on

10

the mutual recognition of jurisdiction and judgment,

11

but it's not.

12

deferring to the courts of habitual residence, but

13

this statute is not raised in terms of court

14

jurisdiction.

15

custodial parent.

16

You -- you said the whole question is

It's in terms of the right of a

MS. HOWE:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and

17

Mr. Abbott has a statutory ne exeat right as well.

18

The fact that he also has this right under the order

19

is irrelevant, we believe, because no one is arguing

20

for -- that -- the question is whether or not he has

21

rights of custody under Chilean law, and it’s Chilean

22

law that confers the ne exeat right.

23

The fact that he also has this right under

24

the order is -- is irrelevant for this case.

You’re not relying on the

MS. HOWE:

We are relying just on the

statute.

JUSTICE BREYER:

If that's so, imagine a

6

well-educated American woman marries a man from a

7

foreign country X.

8

says, the man is completely at fault here, a real

9

rotter.

They have a divorce.

The judge

The woman is 100 percent entitled to every

10

possible bit of custody, and the man can see the child

11

twice a year on Christmas Day at 4:00 in the morning.

12

That's it.

13

Now, there's a law like Chile's that says

14

you can't take the child out of the country without

15

the permission of the father too, this person who gets

16

to see the child twice a year.

17

that's custody.

18

woman supposed to do?

And you’re saying that

It’s custody, and -- and what is the

She can't get a decent job worthy of her

19
20

education.

21

she's entitled to the child.

22

between her life and her child.

23

what this -- this convention is aimed at?

24
25

The -- the -- all the courts said that

MS. HOWE:

She has to choose
And -- and is that

It would be a right of custody,

Justice Breyer, that the convention doesn't look to
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

the purpose.

All it looks --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now -- now, of course, what

I'm asking you with my example --

4

MS. HOWE:

Yes.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is why interpret it that

6

way, where all that you have is a rule of law that

7

applies to everybody, even in the case I've tried to

8

imagine, where to say it's a right of custody would

9

ruin the life of the woman, would give the husband

10

something which he should -- certainly shouldn't have

11

in any moral term, it would seem, and she comes back

12

to the United States and is forced to give her child

13

back to whatever this country is.

14

Now, why give that kind of interpretation to this

15

statute, which seems to have a purpose that’s looking

16

after women and children?

17

MS. HOWE:

Certainly.

I have called it X.

The -- the statute

18

that you hypothesize in this case, Justice Breyer,

19

reflects the domestic country's judgment that the

20

child should remain in the country, unless the father

21

agrees to its departure.

22

child's -- why the --

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

We don't look to why the

Well, that's your

24

conclusion.

I'm just trying to get -- to see if there

25

is any humane purpose underlying the interpretation
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that you have advocated, and certainly there are two

2

interpretations here.

3

present us with a different one.

Your opponents will soon

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

isn't there?

7
8

Certainly -- I mean --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

For the woman to go to

the Chilean court?

11

MS. HOWE:

Exactly, Justice Sotomayor.

12

Under Chilean law and presumably under the law that

13

you've hypothesized as well, Justice Breyer, the woman

14

could go to court and ask for permission to leave the

15

country, and that's precisely what Mrs. Abbott could

16

have done in this case.

17

that.

18
19

She just never opted to do

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, suppose you --

suppose you have a --

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MS. HOWE:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

That isn’t my question.

Okay.
I'm trying to get at what

23

the humane purpose would be, given your interpretation

24

of the law in this kind of situation?

25

MS. HOWE:

Well, the right to determine
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

whether your child will remain in the country or go to

2

another country is a very important right, and it's

3

simply that that's the -- if that's the law that the

4

-- that the country has decided to establish, the

5

convention doesn't look to why that is.

6

And the drafters expressly envisioned,

7

Justice Breyer, that there would be cases in which one

8

parent would have physical custody of the child, the

9

other parent would simply have the right to determine

10
11

the child's place of residence.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But what if -- what if

12

you’d have a country in which ne exeat orders are

13

routinely imposed in every custody case?

14

almost like your statutory case here.

15

have to do with custody?

16
17

MS. HOWE:

What does that

Well, that, again, simply

reflects that country's judgment.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

MS. HOWE:

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21

Then it's

It seems -- excuse me,

Yes.
-- but I'll just finish my

own question.

22

MS. HOWE:

Yes.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It seems to me that what

24

you are saying is that, in some countries, there --

25

there is a presumption that there is always custody in
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the party -- in both parties.

2

MS. HOWE:

There may be a presumption.

We

3

have researched, and we don't believe that that’s

4

actually particularly common, Justice Breyer.

5

certainly in many countries, there’s now a presumption

6

of joint custody.

7

But

And so, in all of those cases, under the

8

convention, the left-behind parent would be entitled

9

to the child's return.

And the convention, again,

10

doesn't look to the purpose.

11

there's nothing in the convention, certainly, that

12

requires that there be one category of parents who

13

have rights of custody and are entitled to the return

14

and another category of parents who are not entitled

15

to the return remedy.

16

of mutual trust under the convention and --

17

It doesn't look to --

There's a -- there's a system

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What happens to the woman

18

who, now she has abducted the child to Texas, and she

19

says to the Texas court:

20

going to be beaten by this man who has a history of

21

being a batterer?

22

MS. HOWE:

If you send me back, I am

Two things, please,

23

Justice Ginsburg.

The first is that that could happen

24

in any case, not simply a case involving a ne exeat

25

right, but also a case in which the left-behind parent
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

had joint custody, and so to a -- the second is that

2

the convention -- yes.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You are saying that the

4

court -- the court that’s asked to give effect to the

5

convention is helpless, that it's automatic that if

6

there is a custody right, the court in the state to

7

which the child has been taken must order that the

8

child be returned?

9

MS. HOWE:

No -- no, Justice Ginsburg.

10

Article 13(b) of the convention provides an

11

affirmative defense to -- to return if the court in

12

the country of refuge determines that the child would

13

face either a grave risk of physical or psychological

14

harm or otherwise face an intolerable situation.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

As long as you brought

16

that up, I was just going to ask:

17

prevail in this case, should there be a remand to see

18

if that section applies?

19

MS. HOWE:

Should -- if you

Article 13(b) has not previously

20

been raised in this case, but in any event,

21

regardless, if this Court were to rule in our favor,

22

then the appropriate course would be to remand for

23

resolution of any remaining issues, yes,

24

Justice Kennedy.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The answer you just

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

gave about concern for the protection of the child,

2

that applies only to the child?

3

the case that we have been discussing, if the woman

4

would be subject to whatever persecution or domestic

5

violence, but the child -- you know, there’s no

6

suggestion of any harm targeted to the child, that

7

would not be a case in which they could grant refuge?

8
9
10

MS. HOWE:

13

The -- the statute does -- the

text does apply to the grave risk of physical or
psychological harm to the child, and certainly --

11
12

In other words, in

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

To only -- only to

the child?
MS. HOWE:

Only to the child, although

14

arguably there would be some risk of psychological

15

harm if what the woman's allegation --

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you know -So the woman would

18

be subject to -- if she wanted to remain with the

19

child, there would be no protection.

20

to choose between subjecting herself to violence or

21

being apart from the child?

22

MS. HOWE:

She would have

Well, the courts could also, of

23

course, Chief Justice Roberts, try, you know, to solve

24

the problem through undertakings and placing

25

conditions on the child's return, if the -- if the
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

article 13(b) were not fully able to address the

2

court's concerns.

3

If the court --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That would be

4

consistent with the convention, for the returning

5

state to say, we are returning the child, but only

6

if -- you know, bang, bang, bang?

7

MS. HOWE:

Well, in other contexts, for

8

example in the context of visas, yes.

The Special

9

Commission meetings, when this issue has come up, has

10

specifically urged the court -- or urged courts to

11

consider undertakings and also to consider

12

intergovernmental negotiations in an attempt to ensure

13

both the mother and the child's safe return, yes.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

What’s the law -- what is

15

the law if a mother and a child -- sorry.

16

law if a couple living in a foreign country has a

17

decree of the court, and the decree of the court

18

grants certain visiting rights to the father, and the

19

father, violating those rights, takes the child to a

20

different country.

What’s the

Can the mother get it back?

21

MS. HOWE:

I'm sorry.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Could you --

What’s the normal law where

23

you have a couple -- they’re supposed to leave the

24

child in the country, but it doesn't say that.

25

There’s no ne exeat thing.

They’ve just agreed to
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

certain visiting rights.

2

MS. HOWE:

Yes.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

And in violation of those

4

rights, the father, say, takes the child to another

5

country in violation of the divorce decree of the

6

first country.

If the mother had rights of

custody, then those rights of custody would be

In the United States, for

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm sure there isn't, but

under the law --

5

MS. HOWE:

-- there could be, for example,

6

7

court with an international order and attempt to seek

8

the child's return in that manner, yes.

9

attempt to seek enforcement of the court's order in

You could go to

You would

the United States.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

You would go and take the

12

court's order to a court in the United States and try

13

to enforce it?

14

MS. HOWE:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

Yes.
And the American court

would be under obligation, I guess, to enforce it?

17

MS. HOWE:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

In theory, yes.

Yes.

Well, all right.

So our

19

question here is which of the two mechanisms should we

20

use?

We should use this convention,

24

I'm still worried about my mother in the case that --

25

that you gave me.
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MS. HOWE:

One thing that -- that may give

2

you some comfort, as far as the convention's drafters

3

are concerned, is that this was a scenario that the

4

convention's drafters had in mind from the very

5

beginning of the drafting process.

6

scenarios that they --

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

They had five

I’ve read through that, and

8

I’ll tell you that, on the basis of my reading through

9

all that stuff, my mind is in equipoise.

10
11

I find some

one way, some the other.
I think maybe each side does a little

12

overstating here, but -- but I -- I am in equipoise,

13

having looked at that quickly.

14

the stuff, you can -- but that's why I am trying to

15

get to the underlying humane idea that’s supposed to

16

underlie that, and see if it applies here.

17

MS. HOWE:

Okay.

So I know -- I know

The -- the convention was

18

drafted on the premise that the best interests of

19

children are served by their return to the country of

20

habitual residence, so that the courts in that country

21

can make the decisions.

22

The convention --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ms. Howe, wasn't the --

23

the problem that gave rise to this Abduction

24

Convention just the situation that Justice Breyer

25

brought up?

That is, the parent that has visitation
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

rights snatches the child, takes it to that parent's

2

home country, and then you are relying on only the

3

court order.

4

on the Abduction of Children.

5

That's why we have the Hague Convention

It wasn't for the -- I mean, this -- this

6

case is not the usual case.

The usual case is the

7

noncustodial parent takes the child out of the country

8

where the custodial parent lives.

9

internationally, there was a huge problem of getting

And,

10

the child back, and that's why we have the Hague

11

Convention on Abduction, because courts weren't

12

enforcing foreign court orders.

13

MS. HOWE:

That's right.

They were -- they

14

were not enforcing foreign court orders, and it's

15

true, Justice Ginsburg, as you say, that the sort of

16

prototypical case that was present when they drafted

17

the convention was that one parent, usually the

18

mother, would have sole physical custody and the

19

father would have just visitation, and it was intended

20

to address that problem.

21

But at the time that they drafted the

22

convention, they also had in mind the increasing

23

prevalence of joint custody and included that in the

24

convention.

25

there would be scenarios in which one parent would

And they also recognized, as I said, that

16
Alderson Reporting Company

1

have what we’d consider to be physical custody of the

2

child; the other parent would have other rights, such

3

as the right to determine the child's place of

4

residence.

5

not have physical custody but had other important

6

rights relating to the child, such as the right to

7

determine the child's place of residence, to be --

8
9

And they did intend for the parent who did

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, what is the -- what

is the significance of their breaking down the two

10

categories?

11

other is rights of access.

One is the rights of custody, and the

12

Because I take it that under your view of

13

the Chilean law, given that the noncustodial parent

14

will always have this right to block taking the child

15

out of the country, then there's really no difference

16

between the two categories, because every, say, father

17

with the right of access -- not custody, just access

18

-- would automatically by virtue of the law of Chile

19

have this one custodial right; that is, to block

20

taking the child out of the country.

21

MS. HOWE:

It's true.

But again,

22

Justice Ginsburg, you don't look at why the country

23

attributed those particular rights.

24

whether the parent has those rights.

25

You just look at

And I think it's helpful to think of the
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Chilean system, in effect, as a -- as a form of joint

2

custody, just as some countries have a presumption of

3

what we would regard as joint custody.

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Does your argument really

5

boil down to the claim that this was, in effect, joint

6

custody?

7

It seems to me it clearly was not.
MS. HOWE:

We believe that the Chilean

8

system is analogous to joint custody.

9

presumption that -- but it --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

11

MS. HOWE:

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

There’s a

I’d say it's not, but --

But -But -- but are you arguing

13

that this -- that this case is -- is the equivalent of

14

a joint custody case?

15

MS. HOWE:

No.

We are arguing that the

16

ne exeat right is a right of custody under the text of

17

the convention.

If the Court has no further questions --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, you’re saying -- I

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

7
8

MS. ANDERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

9

The ne exeat provision at issue in this case

10

gave Petitioner the power to prevent exactly the harm

11

that is the Hague Convention's central concern.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you -- do you agree

13

that every case originating in Chile must come out

14

this way, so that there is a return required?

15

MS. ANDERS:

I agree that Chile has by law

16

decided that the ne exeat right should arise

17

automatically in any parent who has visitation rights.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But that seems to me

19

remote from the concept of custody that the convention

20

has in mind.
MS. ANDERS:

21

I don't think so, Justice

22

Kennedy.

I think the convention -- the explanatory

report makes clear that the convention is designed to

24

protect all of the ways in which joint custody can

For instance, in the United States, when two

parents have automatic joint custody rights in the

between the -- what’s before us in this case and the

11

custody shall be joint?

a different case, in your view?

14

MS. ANDERS:

The same -- would that not be

It would not be a different

case, because the convention protects rights of

11

least.

12

Now, but in a situation where he says to

Mr. Smith, nothing, I want to give you nothing -- he

14

thinks this is Frankenstein's monster; he does not

15

want to give him a single thing -- that, on your

16

interpretation of this statute, that doesn't matter.

17

Just because Chile has a general law that says you

18

can't take anybody out of the country without

19

permission, just because of that, even Frankenstein's

20

monster is considered to have custody for the purposes

21

of this, though the human being who looked at this,

called the family law judge, said:

MS. ANDERS:

And that's what's bothering

Well, I think Chile could have

4

made a determination as a matter of its domestic law,

5

that it would be in the child’s interest --

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

I know there are ways out,

7

but why should we include custody to be a situation

8

where the human being who looked at this couple

9

thought that that individual, the husband, should have

10

nothing but visit him occasionally on Christmas?

11

should we interpret the word "custody" in this treaty

12

to include even that situation, which turns the treaty

13

into a general “return the child” no matter what?

14

MS. ANDERS:

Why

Well, I think the convention's

15

fundamental principles actually are in line with your

16

concerns, because what the convention says is that

17

anytime that the child has been abducted in violation

18

of a decision-making right that the -- that one or the

19

other parent has, then the child should be returned.

20

But the return remedy is not a determination

21

that the child should live with the left-behind parent

22

or that he should live out the rest of his life in

23

Chile.

24

the country of habitual residence should decide what

25

should happen with the child going forward.

It's simply a determination that the courts of

22

Official

the fundamental premise in it.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Ms. Anders, that's the

3

point, isn't it?

The purpose of the convention is

4

which court will decide the life of that child,

5

correct?

6

MS. ANDERS:

That's exactly right.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And to avoid, as I

8

understood the convention structure, this flight from

9

court to court and this long, drawn-out process from

10

country to country over who's going to make that

11

choice, correct?

12

MS. ANDERS:

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's right.
And so the idea is,

14

whether it's one custody right -- correct me if I am

15

wrong -- whether it's one custody right or many, which

16

court is going to decide what's in the best interest

17

of that child?

country to decide whether the child has to be

could raise the 13(b) defense or the article 20

What is the standard on the 13(b)

MS. ANDERS:

It says, "A grave risk that the

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Does -- does the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

status of, in this case, women in the country, does

2

that constitute grave risk, or is it an individualized

3

determination?

4

MS. ANDERS:

I think it would generally be

5

an individualized determination.

convention is based on the assumption that wherever --

wherever the parent started out, wherever their

8

custody determinations are being made to begin with,

9

that is the country that should continue in the normal

But I think the

10

situation to determine what should be in the interest

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And that country is

13

going to make a determination in favor of their

14

domestic law and their domestic system.

15

they are not going to say:

17

MS. ANDERS:

Presumably,

We think it's a grave risk

Well, it would be the -- it

18

would be the courts in the country of residence that

19

would be making that determination.

20

question of which court might have a more favorable

determination, that -- that kind of forum-shopping is

22

precisely what the convention was trying to prevent.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I think the

Well, could we interpret

24

the words "great psychological harm" to include, for

25

advanced degree is unable to get work in the country

2

where her child lives and has to live under conditions

3

that are -- that are really -- we would say are fairly

4

primitive because of her inability to find an

5

appropriate employment?

6

great psychological harm, so that the child wouldn't

7

have to go back?

8
9
10
11

MS. ANDERS:

Can you include that under

Well, I -- I presume that you

could, in an individual case, offer evidence that
might include things like -JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, has there ever been

12

-- would you advocate that kind of very broad standard

13

of great psychological -- and what would be your

14

position, or what's the government's position on that?

15

MS. ANDERS:

It’s that the defense would be

16

more narrow than that.

17

convention is based on the idea that -- that the

18

courts of the country of habitual residence can make

19

this determination in the child's best interest, and

20

that they should be the ones to do that -- we

21

shouldn't allow forum-shopping -- and also because the

22

return remedy is not a determination that the child

23

will have to stay in the country for the rest of his

24

life or even that the mother would necessarily have to

25

return with him.

You don't question what

15

the representative of the mother has said in this

16

case, that the emphasis -- when this Hague Convention

17

was before Congress, the emphasis was on the custodial

18

parent -- that is, the person in the situation of the

19

mother here -- that what Congress was told was the

20

urgent problem was the noncustodial parent taking the

21

child away from the custodial parent.

22

the major thing that drove this convention and that's

23

what the State Department told Congress; isn't that

24

so?

25

MS. ANDERS:

That was the --

I believe the State
28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Department's legal analysis stated that the typical

2

case might be one in which a parent with -- with

3

primary physical custody had the child, but the

4

visiting -- the parent with visitation rights took the

5

child to another country.

6

typical case means that it wasn't the only type of

7

case, and as -- as family law has developed over the

8

past 30 years, joint rights of custody have become

9

more and more prevalent, and we, therefore, think that

10

this is a joint right to determine residence under the

11

convention, because it gives the father the right to

12

withhold or grant consent to the child's removal from

the country.

very different and distinct substantive rights.

What Mr. Abbott is seeking in this case is

2

to have the Court define a bright-line rule, saying

3

that in any instance where there is a statute or a

provision which limits the rights of the custodial

5

parent to remove a child outside of -- of the

6

particular jurisdiction, that any time there is a

7

statute or ordinance or order to that effect, that you

confer rights of custody upon an individual who would

otherwise only have rights of access.

But we consider this joint

Under your view, what defines custody under

11

the convention in a way that would justify an American

12

court saying, that's not a custodial right; even

13

though the law of that domestic jurisdiction defines

that and says, that's our terms of joint custody, but

15

we create this kind of joint custody?

MR. HAYS:

In -- in that situation, the --

17

the rights are created under the law of the

jurisdiction, and that -- and that -- in that

instance, it would be a joint custodial right.

Right.

Regardless of

21

what the terms of that right are, so long as the

22

convention doesn't define custodial rights, correct?

It doesn't give them meaning except in one way, the

4

right to determine a place of residence, correct?

5

MR. HAYS:

No, Your Honor.

What happens is

6

the -- the convention contains an understanding of

7

what the parties at the time of the drafting of the

8

convention understood custodial rights to entail.

9

focus of the convention was on maintaining the

10

relationship between the parent that was providing

11

care.

12

The

And so the members of the convention -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now, that's a little

13

tough, because parents provide care in so many

14

different ways.

15

very cognizant of the fact that in different countries

16

that has different meanings?

17

And weren't the convention members

MR. HAYS:

They were.

But they understood

18

that there was a commonly accepted understanding of

19

custody in terms of the party who had care for the

20

child.

And that was -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

That's not the word they

22

used.

the place of residence."

24

greater meaning to the word "care" than that.

25

They used "custody rights including determining

MR. HAYS:

So they didn't give any

The -- the exact definition from
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

article 5 is “rights of custody shall include rights

2

relating to the care of the person of the child,” and

3

then they said, “and in particular, the right to

4

determine the child's place of residence.”

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, suppose there’s a

6

court order that prohibits the -- one of the

7

parents -- the parent with whom the child lives most

8

of the time from moving more than an hour's drive from

9

the prior place of residence, would that be --

10

would -- would the -- the other parent then have

11

custody?

12

MR. HAYS:

No.

Here again, that is -- that

13

is simply a restriction placed upon that parent's

14

right to exercise custody.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

It is -- it is -Suppose the court order says

16

that the -- that the child may not move from the house

17

where the child lives now.

18

MR. HAYS:

Would that be custody?

Again, that is -- that is simply

19

a restriction on that parent's right to exercise

20

their -- their custodial authority.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

22
23

Well, what’s the meaning of

the phrase "determine the place of residence"?
MR. HAYS:

“Determine the place of

24

residence” was -- was placed into the convention

25

because that ordinarily is a right of custody.
33
Alderson Reporting Company

A

Official

1

parent who ordinarily has the care of the child has

2

the child with them.

3

And I would hazard a guess that if you were

4

to ask anyone in this courtroom what their residence

5

was, they would tell you that their residence is 123

6

Maple Street, that it doesn't entail the determination

7

of the actual country --

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

9

Well, okay.

So, if -- it

there’s a court order that says the child shall not

10

move from 123 Maple Street without the consent of both

11

parents, do both parents then have custody?

12

MR. HAYS:

In -- in that instance, there may

13

be a -- a joint right regarding the -- the

14

determination of the residence, which is not what we

15

have in -- which is not what we have in this case.

16

But here again, it is -- it is more in keeping with

17

simply putting a restriction upon the parents who --

18

the parent who has the right of custody, their right

19

to exercise that.

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Hays --

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

JUSTICE ALITO:

Which is more important,

determining the house in which the child is going to

7

MR. HAYS:

For purposes of the convention,

8

determining the house where -- where the child lives,

9

determining the issues relating to the care of the

10

child, because that was what the convention was

11

intended to protect, that relationship, because you

12

were having situations where a parent who had a

13

custodial relationship with the child would have that

14

relationship severed by the other parent taking the

15

child, going to another country, and then seeking a

16

court order.

17

And there is one thing that I think needs to

18

be corrected here.

she did not attempt to obtain a court order that would

20

have stripped Mr. Abbott of his rights.

When Mrs. Abbott went to Texas,

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why would the signatories of

this convention have wanted to regard a parent as

2

having custodial rights if the parent has the right to

3

veto a change of address within a country, but not

4

when the parent has the authority to veto the future

5

nationality and cultural background of the child?

6

MR. HAYS:

They very well may not have

7

intended either of those instances to create a -- a

8

joint right of -- of custody.

9

when the convention was being drafted, joint custodial

10

rights were -- were basically a new concept, and there

11

were -- there was not a lot of experience in the

12

exercise of joint -- of joint custodial rights.

13

At the point in time

The -- the focus of the convention was

relationship would not be severed by someone taking a

a distinct difference drawn between protecting rights

JUSTICE ALITO:

I don't want to belabor

the point too much, but maybe you could just give

3

me an example of a court order that you believe

4

would give a parent the right to determine place of

5

residence and, therefore, would constitute custody

6

within the meaning of the convention.

7

MR. HAYS:

Typically -- typically in -- in

8

Texas, Texas adheres to a position of joint managing

9

conservatorship.

The presumption in Texas is that

10

both parents have equal ability to make decisions

11

regarding their child.

12

routinely enter orders to say both parents get to

13

decide education, both parents get to decide medical

14

issues.

15

And so the courts will

Even in that instance, though, the court

16

will attribute the right to determine the primary

17

residence of the child to one parent or the other, and

18

will impose a -- a restriction on the exercise of that

19

right.

20

and say, you can establish residence only in this

county or -- or contiguous counties.

They will impose a geographical restriction

That’s in the nature, though, of a -- of a

MR. HAYS:

Actually, Your Honor, that --

of what happened in the Beaumont case.

14

Duran v. Beaumont, there are -- there are distinctions

that have not been made by -- by Mr. Abbott.

16

importantly, there was no court order in that case.

father has a custody right, if it jointly says the

father and the mother will decide what State to live

the father and mother will decide what city, same.

Is there any way I can draw a line, in terms

17

of this statute, between the two situations, the one

18

being where the divorce judge actually focused on the

needs and circumstances of a family, the other being

MR. HAYS:

Our position is that this does

not give any sort of affirmative right to the father,

take the common usage of the right to determine, it is

to make an affirmative decision, and --

And as regards the definition of residence,

12

it’s not defined in article 5(a), but it also appears

in article 5(b), which refers to rights of access.

14

refers to the right to take the child to a place other

15

than the child's habitual residence.

16

history on this point makes quite clear that this

17

refers not only to the right to take -- take the child

18

from the home, but to the right to take the child out

19

of the country.

20

It

And the drafting

In the convention context, the word

21

"determine" can't have the decisive, unilateral

22

meaning that Mrs. Abbott would attribute to it.

23

convention contemplates that rights will be held

24

jointly and requires parents to work collaboratively.

25

So in this case, the Abbotts, by virtue of the ne
55
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official

1

exeat right, by virtue of the ne exeat statute, had a

2

shared, enforceable right to determine whether their

3

child would remain in Chile or would move somewhere

4

else.

5

And despite what Mr. Hays has argued and has

6

argued in his brief, it is a substantive right.

The

7

parent who holds the right has the right to ensure

8

that his child remains in the country of habitual

9

residence, which has huge implications for the

10

language and culture in which the child will be

11

raised, and it ensures that the courts of Chile can

12

resolve any disputes relating to the child.

13

certainly not a mere enforcement mechanism for Mr.

14

Abbott's access right.

15

It’s

With regard to the question of whether or

16

not Mr. Abbott needed to have care and control of the

17

child to invoke rights of custody, article 5(a) of the

18

convention is what defines rights of custody.

19

is nothing in the text of that statute that requires

20

the person invoking the convention to have physical

21

care of the child.
JUSTICE BREYER:

22

There

Can we read that exception

23

there to say -- "grave injury" and so forth -- can we

24

read it as in essence saying, look, do what's best for

25

the child?

MS. HOWE:

That -- you could read that as a

2

form of a best interests of the child standard.

3

believe that we would regard it as a little bit

4

narrower and a grave risk of harm to the child or

5

otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.

6

But it is a form of the best interest standard,

7

certainly.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I

May I ask you, do you

9

agree with your opponent, putting aside removing the

10

child from the country, that within Chile itself the

11

custodial parent had the full right to determine the

12

place of residence?

13

MS. HOWE:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We do agree, yes.
I'm sorry, I'm a

15

little taken aback by your answer to Justice Breyer.

16

You think the grave prosecution standard means

17

whatever is the best interest of the child?

18

MS. HOWE:

No, I believe it's a stricter

19

standard than simply the best interests of the child.

20

It's the -- you know, it's a -- I believe it speaks

21

for itself.

22

to the child.

23

It is a grave risk of psychological harm
The convention --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And you agree with

24

what I understood to be the Solicitor General's

25

position, that that’s an individual-specific and not a

culture-specific determination?

2

MS. HOWE:

Yes, we do.

3

Article 13 is simply an affirmative defense

4

to the -- once a judge has found that rights of

5

custody exist and have been breached.

6

certainly nothing in the history of the convention

7

that reflects any intent by the drafters to narrow the

8

meaning of “rights of custody” through article 13.

There’s

And finally, Mr. Hays cannot point to

10

anything other than a single French trial court

11

decision that holds squarely in his favor, and when

12

that trial court decision was raised at the 1993

13

Special Commission meeting, it garnered no support

14

from the delegates.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The case is submitted.
