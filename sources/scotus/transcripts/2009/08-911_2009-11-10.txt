ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICK M. SCHOENFIELD

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. SCHOENFIELD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
In enacting section 1252(a)(2)(B), Congress

12

limited its reduction of judicial review to where the

13

authority for the Attorney General's discretion is

14

specified under subchapter 2 of chapter 12 of Title 8.

15

Congress did not express any intent to

16

remove the courts’ jurisdiction to review discretionary

17

decisions, the authority for which is specified under

18

any other subchapter or in regulations, nor did Congress

19

express any intent to delegate its constitutional

20

responsibility to determine Federal jurisdiction to the

21

Attorney General --

22
23
24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Under what authority

were these regulations issued?
MR. SCHOENFIELD:

The regulation that grants

discretion with regard to motions to reopen comes from a

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

section in subchapter 1, not subchapter 2, of the

2

regulations.

3

Title 8.

And that was authorized by section 1103 of

4

I should say the authorizing statute for

5

the regulation is in subchapter 1, not subchapter 2.

6

And that's --

MR. SCHOENFIELD:

21

section, it would be nice to have it in the materials.

22

I mean, I guess I can send for it, but --

23

MR. SCHOENFIELD:

Sure.

It -- it indicates,

24

on page 18 of the reply brief, that, quote, "Establish

25

such regulations... as he deems necessary for carrying

2

The fact that the statute we are focused on

states that authority must be specified in this

4

subchapter -- being subchapter 2 --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Two.

The -- the key word

6

that is emphasized in this case is it's "under,"

7

instead of "in."

8
9

MR. SCHOENFIELD:

The word used in the --

in the statute is "under," which, of course, has a

10

variety of definitions.

11

statute in context, that the correct definition to apply

12

is "according to" or "within."

13
14

We believe that taking the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It would be clearer if

it had said "in."
MR. SCHOENFIELD:

15

Congress could have said

16

"in," but I think Congress made it clear by using the

17

phrase "authority specified under," so we’re not -- we

18

don't have a situation where, as Congress usually would

19

do, they would say: a regulation under such and such a

20

statute, where Congress uses the word "regulations."

21

There is the -- the term "regulation" is not used in the

22

statute.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If you were to

24

evaluate the validity of the regulation, I suppose,

25

like, an APA case or similar to that, what statutory

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

provision would you look to, to see if the regulation

2

was consistent with that statutory provision?
MR. SCHOENFIELD:

3
4

We would look to section

1103 in subchapter 1.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So it really doesn't matter

6

what "under" means, right?

7

accept the other interpretation of "under," to wit, that

8

it includes regulations pursuant to the subchapter, your

9

point is that this regulation is not even pursuant to

10

I mean, even -- even if you

the subchapter.
MR. SCHOENFIELD:

11

That's absolutely correct,

12

Your Honor.

Although we don't think regulations are

13

included, even if they were, it's not in the subchapter.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I understand.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.

Yes, but -- is that

16

right?

17

insight into the scope of the regulation and how it was

18

a fair interpretation of the authority under which the

19

Attorney General purported to act?

20

Would -- would subchapter 1 give you much

MR. SCHOENFIELD:

I think that in terms of

21

looking at the discretion of the Attorney General,

22

historically, on motions to reopen, there have been --

23

there has been discretion.

24
25

What the regulation did was to codify that
historical authority and to be consistent with what the

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

courts had always done, but I think, in interpreting

2

the scope of Congress's intent to reduce judicial

3

review, we need to be very careful about that,

4

obviously.

5

6

the authority in the subchapter, which we don't.

7

And so, therefore, when it says "as under

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The -- the -- subchapter 2

8

does talk about a special rule on reopening for battered

9

spouses, children, and parents.

10

Is that a statute where

the discretion is committed to the Attorney General?
MR. SCHOENFIELD:

11

No, Your Honor, because

12

subchapter 2 does not say that the Attorney General has

13

discretion to decide motions to reopen.

14

is only found in the regulation.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

That language

The only reference --

So -- so it -- so absent

16

the regulation, you would interpret the statute as

17

saying there is no discretion?
MR. SCHOENFIELD:

18

Absent the regulation, I

19

would interpret the statute as being silent as to the

20

matter.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, that wasn't my

22

question.

Let's say there’s no regulation.

And the

23

statute says, number one, there shall -- so subchapter 2

24

of the statute says, number one, there shall be motions

25

to reopen.

And then there is a special rule for

7
Alderson Reporting Company

1

battered spouses.

2

Now, you would interpret that statute,

3

absent any regulation, as saying this is not within the

4

discretion of the Attorney General?

5

MR. SCHOENFIELD:

I would interpret the

6

statute as not providing for discretion, yes, Your

7

Honor.

It does -- it does not address

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why -- why would it -- I

16

don't -- the big obstacle I find with your position is

17

that it doesn't make any sense.

18

Why would Congress want to exclude review

19

for discretionary judgments by the Attorney General that

20

are recited explicitly to be discretionary in the

21

statute, but provide judicial review for judgments that

22

are just as lawfully discretionary because the Attorney

23

General is given the authority to make them

24

discretionary and has done so?

25

I mean, a discretionary judgment is a

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

discretionary judgment.

2

legitimate one.

3

discretion which is given to the Attorney General under

4

the statute, as opposed to discretion which he has

5

wrongfully assumed, but -- but both -- both exercises of

6

discretion are just as lawful, right, under the statute?

7

One is explicit in the statute, and the other is

8

pursuant to the authority of the Attorney General to

9

make it discretionary.

10
11

Why -- at least if it's a

I can understand why you would say

Why would Congress want the one to be
subject to judicial review and not the other?
MR. SCHOENFIELD:

12

Judicial review of motions

13

to reopen has -- has been the traditional normal process

14

for the court to take.

15

here was saying:

16

going to remove judicial review, but not in all

17

instances.

20

In certain specified instances, we are

And the question is, where did Congress draw

18
19

I think what Congress was doing

the line?

Congress -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, and I'm saying why

21

is it a rational line to say -- I think it's a rational

22

line to say, when lawful discretion is being exercised,

23

since it's a discretionary judgment, you're not entitled

24

to it anyway, and therefore, we won't review it.

25

makes some sense.

10
Alderson Reporting Company

That

Official

1

And I -- but where discretion is lawfully

2

exercised, why would -- why would Congress say, oh, when

3

the discretion is lawfully exercised because the statute

4

says so, we have one approach, but where discretion is

5

lawfully exercised only because the statute allows the

6

Attorney General to prescribe discretion, we will not

7

allow it?

8

to do that.

I don't understand why -- why it would want

9

MR. SCHOENFIELD:

10

several reasons, Your Honor.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

MR. SCHOENFIELD:

Well, let me suggest

Okay.
First, if the Court was to

13

read the statute as allowing a regulation to create

14

discretion and, therefore, to remove judicial review -JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

Well, you -- you don't --

16

you don't contest that the regulation can provide

17

discretion.

18

invalid.

You -- you don't say the regulation is

19

MR. SCHOENFIELD:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

That's correct.
So it is a valid exercise

of discretion, right?

22

MR. SCHOENFIELD:

And courts frequently

23

review decisions for abuse of discretion.

24

to reopen, I would suggest, are particularly important

25

because it creates a safety net for review.

11
Alderson Reporting Company

And motions

It deals

Official

1

with -- like, rule 60(b) of the Federal rules, it deals

2

with potentially new evidence, matters that weren't

3

available to bring initially, and it's important that

4

potential mistakes be reviewed.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I just want to return for

6

a moment to the battered spouse provision.

7

spouse provision specifically says that in the Attorney

8

General's discretion, he may waive the time limit for

9

the 1 year for the battered spouse.

10

The battered

Now, that surely is discretion specified --

11

and I think the word "specified" is important here --

12

specified in subchapter 2.

judicial review as to that.
You would have to agree with that, wouldn't

15
16

So there should be no

you?
MR. SCHOENFIELD:

Yes, as to the -- as to

17

waiving -- as to waiving the -- on the number of

18

motions, yes.

19

On that point, yes.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

All right.

So then the

20

thing that Congress cares about most is something the

21

court can't review.

22

That is counterintuitive.

MR. SCHOENFIELD:

Congress specified some 30

23

instances of discretion to the Attorney General in

24

subchapter 2, and I believe it drew the line there and

25

said, if we did not specify it in subchapter 2, then it

12

1

is reviewable, just as courts have traditionally

2

reviewed these matters.

3

If there --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The ones that have been

4

codified by statute -- those prior to the codification

5

were by regulation.

6

Is that -- is that so?

MR. SCHOENFIELD:

The regulation regarding

7

motions to reopen existed before the statute.

8

could readily have made that part of the statutory

9

scheme if it had chosen to do so, but it did not.

If there are no further questions, I would
like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONER

20

Congress

MS. SAHARSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The statute at issue does not bar judicial

21

review of denials of motions to reopen.

And I would

22

like to go right to one of the questions that was asked

23

by Justice Scalia, which is:

24

of this statute, in terms of what Congress is doing in

25

not allowing judicial review of specifications of

How do you make sense out

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

discretion in regulations, but -- I'm sorry, and

2

allowing judicial review of things that are specified in

3

regulations, but not things that are specified in the

4

subchapter?

5

And I think that the answer to this question

6

comes from the text of the statute, particularly if you

7

compare the two things that are in 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) and

8

(ii), that all of the things that are listed in (i) and

9

that are covered by (ii) are substantive decisions that

10

are made by the Executive in the immigration context as

11

a matter of grace, things that involve whether aliens

12

can stay in the country or not.

13

at the end of the day, that the Executive, in the

14

exercise of its immigration and foreign affairs power,

15

has the authority to decide and that Congress did not

16

want the Federal courts in the business of reviewing.

17

And those are matters,

But what the Federal courts have often

18

reviewed are things where discretion is committed by

19

regulation, and these are procedural matters that

20

relates to whether an alien had a fair shot of getting

21

his claim heard by the agency and by the Federal courts.

22

Things like --

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What about my question

24

with reference to motions to -- to reopen?

specified under subchapter 2.

That's right there in

subchapter 2:

There shall be a motion to reopen.

Now, if you had no regulation upon it,

3

wouldn't you say that would be within the discretion of

the Attorney General?

I would say that the Attorney

General has the discretion to issue regulations with

No, that's not my

Hypothetical, not a real case.

11

MS. SAHARSKY:

Yes.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Just so we can talk about

13

the statute.

14

the one we are most interested in, specifies -- and

15

that's one of the words -- that there shall be a motion

16

to reopen.

17

The statute says there -- subchapter 2,

Now, don't you think that's within the

18

discretion of the Attorney General, absent any

19

regulations?

20

MS. SAHARSKY:

Yes, because the statute --

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

All right.

So absent a

22

regulation, there would be jurisdiction stripping under

23

that provision, right?

24

MS. SAHARSKY:

No.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why?

15

MS. SAHARSKY:

2

are positing, the discretion of the Attorney General is

Under this subchapter, that means that there
needs to be something specific, specified, explicit,
specifically noted in the text of the statute.

11

All right.

But you would

12

give me, or would you, the concession that -- or

13

agreement that the Attorney General's discretion to

14

waive the time limit for battered spouses is committed

15

to him?

21

that the thing Congress cares about so much that it

22

makes a specific provision can't be subject to judicial

23

review.

MS. SAHARSKY:

I think that that is like the

-- the various matters that Congress listed as specified

16
Alderson Reporting Company

1

as discretionary within the text of the relevant

2

subchapter, that it decided that this was a matter of

3

Executive grace that it did not want the Federal courts

4

involved in.

5

But the Federal courts have long reviewed

6

things like denials of motions to reopen, continuance

7

denials, where you have a situation in which the Federal

8

courts wanted to make sure that aliens were getting a

18

that what Congress meant to do here is to take all the

19

procedural decisions, including reopening ones, and

20

Because he gets review of the substance, he should get

MS. SAHARSKY:

If what he's seeking is a

review of an exercise of discretion, then that is not

reviewable, because of the reason that the initial

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, by the way, this

reopening is done by regulation, not done by statute.

That's where I get to the problem.

You are trying to distinguish between

5

whether it's done by regulation or done by statute.

6

I'm trying to distinguish on a very different context.

7

Treat the motion to reopen the same as you treat the

8

initial motion, whether it's done by regulation or

9

whether it's done by statute.

10

MS. SAHARSKY:

And

Right, and what I'm

11

suggesting is that the difference there is between a

12

substantive determination that's a matter of grace and a

13

procedural determination to make sure that an alien gets

14

a fair shot, and it is --

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, I -- I'm

16

sorry, do you want to finish?

Okay.

I -- I find it curious -- and maybe you can

19

illuminate it for me -- that the Justice Department is

20

before us, arguing that the Justice Department can't be

21

trusted without judicial review.

22

(Laughter.)

23

And I find that doubly curious when the

24
25

Justice Department won on the opposite position below.
I mean, are you suggesting that the statute

is so absolutely clear that you could not stand there

Department could be trusted to exercise his discretion,

4

but in fact you are saying:

5

we are not going to defend it because we think the

6

Attorney General needs judicial review to help him stay

7

in line?

8

MS. SAHARSKY:

I know we won on that, but

In the vast majority of

9

cases, of course we believe that the Board can be

10

trusted, and that's why review is for an abuse of

11

discretion, and it has been for many years.

12

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This Court

Yes, but if you take

14

-- if you continued to argue the position you won on

15

before the -- before the Seventh Circuit, it wouldn't be

16

that the standard of review is -- is so deferential that

17

it is okay.

18

It would be there is no review at all.
MS. SAHARSKY:

That's right, but we did not

19

argue to the Seventh Circuit that there was no

20

jurisdiction here.

21

In fact, it has been our position since 2004

22

that the text of this statute, particularly the text,

23

the context, the history, is so clear that we could not

24

reasonably take the alternate position.

25

MS. SAHARSKY:

it directed all of the attorneys in the Office of

6

But this --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Can you give me an idea of

7

how many motions to reopen are brought to the courts for

8

review each year?

9

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, there are approximately

10

between 8 and 10,000 motions to reopen filed by the

11

Board of -- before the Board of Immigration Appeals each

12

year, and about between 15 and 20 percent of those are

13

granted.

14

So if you look at the -- the remaining 80 to

15

85 percent that are denied, the general appeal rate for

16

the courts of appeals is about 30 percent from the Board

17

of Immigration Appeals.

18

appeal rate is about the same for motions to reopen, you

19

could get a number that way.

20

are a substantial number –-

21
22
23

So if you assume that the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So, you know, we -- there

So we are talking about 2

or 3,000 petitions to the court each year?
MS. SAHARSKY:

But the -- the point that we

24

are making is that there are these circumstances that

25

Congress has recognized, and this Court recognized it in

25
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Dada.

The motions to reopen serve several important

2

purposes, and, yes, they are reviewed under a very

3

deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.

4

think in many cases that the Board was doing something

5

wrong and that it needs to be overturned.

6

We do not

But, for example, in the -- in a similar

7

context of continuance denials, say there was an

8

immigration judge who did not allow an alien to seek a

9

continuance in order to get an attorney to bring forth

10

his case before the immigration judge.

would be a question of law in that circumstance.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if you think it's

so bad, the Attorney General doesn't have to do it.

21

do you need a court to tell you that?

22

long served a very important check on the Board's

13

Whenever somebody delegates authority, they retain

MS. SAHARSKY:

That's right.

The Attorney

16

General does police the Board, but the courts of appeals

17

have long done that too, particularly in the context of

18

motions to reopen.

19

This Court, just a couple of years ago in

20

Dada, recognized the important functions that motions to

21

reopen serve and assumed that there would be judicial

22

review of motions to reopen.

23

judicial review of motions to reopen, albeit under the

24

abuse-of-discretion standards, goes back to 1916, and we

25

just didn't see anything in 1996 to suggest that

MS. SAHARSKY:

Before the BIA existed, so

8

back in the 1916 context, there were immigration

9

officers, and you could ask them to reconsider or reopen

10

your case.

In -- I think it was 1940 or 1941, the Board

11

came into being, and the Attorney General quickly

12

enacted regulations that provided for either sua

13

sponte reopening or for the filing of a motion to

14

reopen.

15

the same form until 1996, when they were amended to make

16

discretion explicit in the regulation, and the 1996 is

17

essentially the same form that it’s in today.

18

has -- there has always been an assumption that there

19

can be such a thing as reopening.

And those regulations existed in substantially

So there

And I -- I just want to focus on what

telling.

23

bars to judicial review, and we also know that Congress

24

was codifying for the first time an alien's right to

25

file one motion to reopen.

We know that Congress was focused on enacting

28
Alderson Reporting Company

But Congress just didn't make any effort to

2

make denials of motions to reopen judicially

3

unreviewable, and that's very telling, because there’s

4

any number of ways that Congress could have done that.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

I didn't do the math fast

6

enough in my head when you were answering Justice

7

Kennedy's question, but is he correct that the effect of

8

accepting your argument is about 2,000 additional

9

appeals that -- that the Department of Justice will have

10
11

to brief and the courts of appeals will have to decide?
MS. SAHARSKY:

You know, I -- I haven't done

12

the math on that, either, and I think it requires the

13

assumptions that I set out to Justice --

14
15
16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes.

On the assumptions

that you made, do you know what the -- the result is?
MS. SAHARSKY:

I -- I don't, because we

17

haven't calculated the number of motions throughout, and

18

we only have total numbers in the courts of appeals.

19

But let me say, if you are concerned about

20

the burden on the courts of appeals, every court but the

21

Seventh Circuit that has considered the issue has found

22

that the provision at issue doesn't bar judicial review.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF AMANDA C. LEITER

20

AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING THE JUDGMENT BELOW

21
22
23

MS. LEITER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Congress enacted IIRIRA to reduce the burden

24

that immigration cases imposed, and continue to impose,

25

on the Federal courts.

The plain language of the Act

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

strictly limits Federal court jurisdiction to review the

2

discretionary decisions of immigration officials.

3

fact, as this Court has explained, the theme of the

4

legislation was to protect the Attorney General's

5

discretion from the courts.

6
7

Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) is central to that
theme.

8
9

In

Before I discuss the language and meaning of
the section, I want to make one point very clear.

The

10

section does not preclude judicial review of legal and

11

constitutional claims.

12

preserved by section 1252(a)(2)(D).

13

Both of those are expressly

But that provision came

15

years after.

respect --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

acting as policymakers.

6

be looking to that to define what Congress intended

7

then, when it --

The question is:

8

MS. LEITER:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

With

Why should we

With respect, Your Honor --- stripped jurisdiction

earlier or granted it?
MS. LEITER:

11

I believe this Court always

12

would have understood and Congress understood that its

13

jurisdiction strip would have had an exception for

14

constitutional claims even as of 1996.
In 1988, this Court issued Webster v. Doe,

15
16

finding that section 701(a)(2), which is quite parallel

17

to this provision, recognizes certain claims as

18

committed to agency discretion by law.

19

excuse me -- this Court in 1988 recognized that

20

provision as requiring a constitutional exception.

21

I think Congress, acting in 1996, would have recognized

22

that the same -- very similar language in section

23

1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) would also have a constitutional

24

exception.

25

Congress --

And

I agree with you that there would not have

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

been a legal exception but for the enactment of

2

1252(a)(2)(D).
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

Well, couldn't we look

4

at the fact that when Congress was considering whether

5

to put back into the jurisdiction-stripping statute an

6

exception for constitutional claims, it then knew,

7

because the courts of appeals except for the Seventh,

8

who just recently did it, were routinely taking

9

jurisdiction over motions to reopen?

10

Don't you think that was the time for them

11

to tell us:

Hey, you guys got it wrong; we are going to

12

make motions to reopen statutorily discretionary, so if

13

there’s any doubt about this, let's clear up what our

14

intent is.
MS. LEITER:

15

Well, Justice Sotomayor,

16

certainly had Congress done that, we wouldn't be here.

17

However, it is not true that the courts of appeals as of

18

that date had been uniform in their view that section

19

1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) did not extend to regulations.

20

None had extended it to motions to reopen,

21

but in CDI Services v. Reno in 2002, the Sixth Circuit

22

recognized section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) as extending to

23

regulations.

24

for a visa extension.

25

the -- excuse me -- Eighth Circuit similarly recognized

That was in the context of a -- a petition
And Onyinkwa v. Ashcroft in 2004,

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that.

And then in Yerkovich v. Ashcroft in the same

2

year, the Eighth -- excuse me -- the Tenth Circuit also

3

recognized 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) as extended to regulations.

4

So the confusion plainly existed as of the

5

date of the REAL ID Act.

6

Congress, frankly, in that position, actually to clarify

7

the reverse.

8

point --

9

And I think the burden was on

If Congress wanted to make clear at that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Wait a minute, you’re --

10

you’re arguing from a real negative, because some courts

11

had said that other statutes were covered by the

12

jurisdictional bar.

13

that no court had held that motions to reopen -- that

14

there was no jurisdiction for motions to reopen, that

15

somehow it should have --

16

You’re arguing that they knew

MS. LEITER:

With respect, Your Honor, it is

17

the same statute at section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).

18

were holding exactly what the Seventh Circuit held and

19

what we argue here, which is that section

20

1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) extends two things specified as

21

discretionary in regulations issued under the Act.

22

And they

They had not yet considered the issue with

23

respect to motions to reopen, but with respect to other

24

issues specified as discretionary in regulations, they

25

held that the -- that the Act clearly extended to those

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

issues and stripped the courts of jurisdiction.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But on a motion to

3

reopen, there is -- Seventh Circuit stands alone,

4

doesn't it?

5

MS. LEITER:

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

It does, Your Honor.

Yes.

And how many circuits are

on the other side?

8

MS. LEITER:

I believe there are six.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Was there any -- ever a

10

decision in any of those six circuits that went the way

11

the Seventh Circuit went on the motion to reopen?

12

MS. LEITER:

No, Your Honor.

And that

13

appears to be because the circuits, even the Sixth,

14

Eighth, and Tenth, were persuaded by the existence of

15

the consolidation provision, section 1252(b)(6), but

16

motions to reopen should for some reason be treated

17

differently than other things specified as discretionary

18

in regulations.

19

But their --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

Yes, they seem to treat motions

7

to reopen differently as reviewable, and they have been

8

persuaded to do that by the existence of section

9

1252(b)(6), the consolidation provision.

10

But as I explained earlier --

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Has any of them, since

12

switching to -- or since holding this with respect to

13

motions to reopen, reaffirmed their view with regard to

14

other discretionary judgments?
MS. LEITER:

15

Not that I have found, Your

16

Honor, but nor have they repudiated it.

25

And motions

36
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Do you get any mileage from that, or you

2

seem to rest your argument instead on the regulations?

3

And I think that's almost a weaker argument.

4

MS. LEITER:

Frankly, Your Honor, I do not

5

think that specification of discretion -- with the

6

exception of the battered spouse's provision that you --

7

that you raised earlier, I do not think the

8

specification of discretion with respect to other

9

aspects of motions to reopen is sufficiently clear in

10

the statute to convey discretion.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

11

So you -- you consider --

12

you -- you think it's plausible to have a regime where

13

motions to reopen are not discretionary at all, absent

regulation?

15

That would seem very odd to me.
MS. LEITER:

No, Your Honor.

I think when

16

Congress referred to a specification of discretion in

17

section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), they intended, effectively,

18

to provide a notice requirement.

19

that the Attorney General did under the Immigration Acts

20

prior to the enactment of IIRIRA, after the enactment of

21

IIRIRA, that were understood to be discretionary.

22

There are many things

What the statute calls for is a different

23

category of discretionary decisions:

24

are specified as discretionary to be unreviewable; other

25

things that have long been understood to be

37

Those things that

Official

discretionary remain reviewable.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Do you want to say anything

3

about, apparently, this idiosyncratic thought that I

4

have had?

5

sides are arguing:

6

discretion given by statute or given by regulation, and

7

we draw the line on reviewability there.

8
9

This is -- it’s -- my thought is that both
We just look to see if it's

Now, what we're talking about is a big set
of cases, including frauds and various things where

10

there is some discretion substantively to let the person

11

stay.

12

if it's fraud, et cetera, we don't want review.

13

it's asylum, we want review.

14

basically -- basically?

15

MS. LEITER:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, on that big set of cases, the statute says
But if

Isn't that how it works,

Basically.
Okay.

Fine.

I'm saying

17

instead of looking to see whether it's a rehearing

18

or procedural or reopening matter, period, you look

19

to see whether it has to do with the basic category.

20

If it's something that Congress doesn't want courts

21

to meddle in, that carries over to reopening, which

22

is the same thing; it carries over to rehearing

23

petitions -- they’re all about the same thing.

24

it's something that Congress did want courts to meddle

25

in, like asylum, it carries over to reopening, and it

38
Alderson Reporting Company

And if

Official

1

carries over to rehearing petitions and other such

2

matters.
So Congress has one simple judgment:

3

We

4

want courts to meddle in these affairs substantively or

5

we don't.

6

what you want, unless it’s unconstitutional, that's what

7

we give you.

And our job would be to say, right, if that's

Do you see the way -- I'm just drawing the
line vertically instead of horizontally.

11

to no one else.

Now, to me that makes sense, but apparently
So I would like to be talked out.

12

(Laughter.)

13

MS. LEITER:

With respect, Your Honor, I

14

think that "no one" includes Congress.

15

that -- that that line --

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

(Laughter.)

19

MS. LEITER:

21

I think that

I didn't leave anyone out.

No one is universal.

18

But I agree,

That line might have made sense

had Congress drawn it, but Congress -JUSTICE BREYER:

How do we know they didn't?

22

I mean, there’s such a thing in the law called -- what

23

we think of often -- they often use the word "ancillary"

24

to describe it.

25

with it the application to ancillary matters, the thing

that are bound up in X, even though they don't have a

3

separate sentence because you can't think of everything

4

that describes every matter ancillary to X.

5

normal in law.

6

MS. LEITER:

That's

The words Congress used here,

7

though, are those decisions specified as discretionary

8

kind or --

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, and we would say those

10

decisions specified includes those decisions that are

11

totally wrapped up in the same thing.

12

person tries to escape this by simply making his main

13

argument in a rehearing petition, he can't escape it,

14

because it's really the same thing.

15

MS. LEITER:

16

category of things is unreviewable.

17

with is that the regulation at issue here, regulation

18

1003.2, specifies in no uncertain terms that motions to

19

reopen are discretionary, and therefore, if "specified

20

under" extends to regulations, there is no way in my

21

view not to extend --

22

So that if a

I agree, Your Honor, that that

JUSTICE BREYER:

What I'm struggling

Well, why not?

This is not

23

a matter that is the subject of the special provision.

24

A reopening petition is the same kind of thing,

25

identical to the initial petition, and so something that

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

applies to the initial petition applies to the reopening

2

petition because they are the same kind of animal.

3

you have a -- you know -- I mean, okay.

4

I see the point, no point going further.

5

MS. LEITER:

If

Oh, forget it.

With respect, Your Honor, I

6

think the language Congress used was clear here and

7

extends clearly to decisions -- decisions specified as

8

discretionary under the subchapter.

10
11

the subchapter, but it did not.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Congress could

12

reason why some universe of things that could be

15

MS. LEITER:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, the

16

description of something as discretionary has

17

consequences for the Attorney General, for the

18

administrative process.

19

consequence of stripping the courts of jurisdiction.

20

court -- excuse me -- the Attorney General needs to

21

determine a rule of evidence for motions before it,

22

needs to determine rules of procedure, needs to

23

determine a rule of decision, and so there are -- there

24

are categories of matters where I could imagine Congress

25

saying to itself:

It has only the ancillary

The rule of decision here is really

41
Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official

1

not something with which we need to concern ourselves.

2

It is up to the Attorney General to decide whether this

3

is a discretionary decision or whether this is instead a

4

decision that he or she would like to -- to constrain in

5

some way by having certain specific rules of decision to

6

go by.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, it's -- the

8

question isn't whether the Attorney General or the BIA

9

exercises discretion.

In all of these, the Attorney

10

General exercises discretion.

The question is immunity

11

from court review, and ordinarily that's done by

12

statute.

13

you do, where the decision whether a matter that the

14

agency rules on will be exempt from judicial review is

15

made by the agency itself -- the very agency that makes

16

the decision, rather than by the legislature.

And I do not know of another instance, perhaps

17

MS. LEITER:

I will answer your question

18

first.

19

categories of decisions where even the rules of decision

20

are best left to the agency to determine.

21

category, Congress leaves it open to the agency to

22

decide whether to specify those matters as discretionary

23

or instead to specify more constraining rules of

24

decision.

25

I can imagine Congress believing that there are

And in that

And -- and I'm not

be given discretion to rule on the matter, but the

5

question is:

6

discretion will be immune from judicial review?

7

Congress might well say:

8

within your discretion.

9

delegate to you, too, the matter whether the court will

11

The Attorney General can

MS. LEITER:

Right.

Two things, Your Honor.

12

First, the jurisdictional consequence of the

13

discretionary specification here attached after the

14

Attorney General applied the label.

15

a situation in which the Attorney General was making a

16

determination as to what things should be reviewable.

17

The Attorney General was making a -- a decision as to

18

what rule of decision to apply in motions to reopen, and

19

Congress later attached the jurisdictional significance.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So here this is not

If -- if your

21

interpretation of "under" is right.

22

MS. LEITER:

Well, Congress acted later and

23

may, if our interpretation is correct, have attached the

24

jurisdictional significance at that point, yes.

25

With respect to your question about other

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

examples of situations in which an agency is left to

2

make a determination that has jurisdictional

3

consequences, I have a few examples.

4

Communications Act of 1934.

5

Global Crossing that the agency there could determine

6

that a -- that conduct under the Act was unreasonable.

7

That is an administrative determination under one

section of the Act.

9

another section of the Act of creating a cause of action

10

The first is the

A second example is actually section

12

701(a)(2) of the Administrative Procedure Act which

13

refers to categories of decisions that are committed to

14

agency discretion by law.

15

that is not the broad subset of discretionary decisions

16

but instead that subcategory of discretionary decisions

17

for which there is no law to apply, and many courts

18

recognize that the agencies may create the law to apply

19

in those circumstances.

Courts have understood that

2

a motion to reopen would be committed by law to agency

discretion under 702?

5

or not it's rationally exercised.

MS. LEITER:

Because it seems to me that, you

I do not, Your Honor.

I

7

believe there is law to apply in this circumstance,

25

subsection (e) of the statute; whereas, Romanette (iii)

5

that there was an administrative determination to be

10

That is a determination by

Clearly there, where Congress recognized

the statute to the administrative determination.
I also have three examples, Your Honor, of

11
12

situations in chapter 8 in which Congress actually uses

13

the phrase "specified under," the same phrase at issue

14

here, to refer again through the statute to

15

administrative determinations.

16

unfortunately in the briefs.

17

These are not

8 U.S.C. 1227 -- excuse me.

Let me start

18

with 8 U.S.C. 1375a(a)(4) and (a)(6).

This is a

19

provision that calls for the preparation of a pamphlet

20

on the legal rights of immigrant victims of domestic

21

violence.

22

to be distributed and made available, quote, "in the

23

language as specified under paragraph (4)." Turning to

24

paragraph (4) then, it clearly anticipates an

25

administrative determination, because it says the

Paragraph 1375a(a)(6) calls for the pamphlet

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Secretary of Homeland Security in consultation with the

2

Attorney General and the State Department shall

3

determine at least 14 languages into which the pamphlet

4

is translated.

5

So that's an example of Congress using

6

"specified under" to refer, yes, in the first instance

7

to statutory language, as it does in our provision,

8

specified under subchapter 2, but it is a situation in

9

which the statutory language to which "specified under"

10

refers clearly anticipates some exercise of

11

administrative authority.

12
13
14
15
16
17
18

Here, the exercise of administrative
authority is the specification of languages.
In our example, it is the specification of
procedures for motions to reopen.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask this question

before you finish -- if it is an appropriate time?
What is your response to their argument they

19

raise in the reply brief that this was specified under

20

subchapter 1, rather than subchapter 2?

21

MS. LEITER:

Your Honor, subchapter 1

22

includes the language that grants authority broadly to

23

the Attorney General to issue regulations implementing

24

the chapter, and the language implemented by the motions

25

to reopen regulations exists in subchapter 2.

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

The motion to reopen regulations very

2

clearly implements Section 1229(a), which is in

3

subchapter 2.

4

one would look to determine whether Regulation 1003.2 is

5

a valid regulation, a reasonable interpretation of the

6

statute, and for that, I believe one would have to look

7

at the content of section 1229(a), which is in

8

subchapter 2, so although --

9

And a question asked earlier was where

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Except that the text refers

10

not just to the -- the discretion, it refers -- it says

11

the authority for which is specified under this

12

subchapter and the authority to issue that -- the

13

authority to issue the regulation is under subchapter 1.
MS. LEITER:

14
15

I am

certainly not -JUSTICE SCALIA:

16
17

Yes, Justice Scalia.

No.

You would have to say,

no, Justice Scalia, if you want to win this.

18

(Laughter.)

19

MS. LEITER:

Yes, the phrase includes the

20

word the authority, Justice Scalia, but I don't think it

21

can bear the weight that Petitioner and the government

22

put on it.

23

the authority that is clearly granted in section 1103 to

24

implement the entire chapter.

25

I believe that “authority” there references

But what the section does is to indicate

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

where the specification of discretion must be located,

2

and in this case, it must be located in either the

3

statute or regulations issued under it, and to see

4

that, I think the easiest illustration is to suppose

5

that the statute read:

6

to review any decision specified as discretionary --

7

excuse me -- decision, the authority for which is

8

specified as discretionary in the subchapter or in

9

regulations issued thereunder.

No court shall have jurisdiction

10

If Congress had used belts and suspenders in

11

that way and made itself doubly clear, there would be no

12

question here that the word "authority" was somehow

13

superfluous or misplaced.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Do you have any reason why

15

Congress would have taken great trouble to make certain

16

that courts can review asylum decisions, but Congress

17

would not have wanted a court to review a reopening of

18

an asylum matter, which can be done, after all, only if

19

something new comes up that justifies asylum?

20

For example, a new government comes and

21

takes over a country, and now they are going to

22

murder the person, and that couldn't be considered the

23

first time because the old government was there, and

24

they were just going to torture him, all right?

25

so there's something new here.

50
Alderson Reporting Company

So --

Official

1

Now, why would any human being say, we want

2

to get courts involved in the first decision, but we

3

want to keep them out of the second decision?

4

MS. LEITER:

The -- the best answer I have,

5

Justice Breyer, is that Congress wanted to cut off

6

review at some point, and it was a question of numbers

7

of bites at the apple.

8

that the second --

9

I understand your point, that --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Reopening is not a bite at

10

the apple.

Reopening is a new thing; at least, by and

11

large, and supposed to be -- a change.
MS. LEITER:

12

And that may have been part of

13

Congress's concern, that, of course, by and large, it is

14

supposed to be, but it may not always be used in that

15

way, and, at some point, Congress wanted to draw the

16

line.

17

what Congress did here was to set up a regime under

18

which things that are specified as discretionary are

19

unreviewable.

20

And I note here that Congress did not -- I mean,

But there is some room here for the Attorney

21

General to remove the specification of discretion if

22

that system is unworkable --

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And, of course, if your

24

interpretation produces the anomaly that Justice Breyer

25

just described, the government's interpretation produces

51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the opposite anomaly.

Right?

2

MS. LEITER:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

Certainly, Your Honor.
Exactly, and that's why I

ended up with this unusual --

5

(Laughter.)

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And I suppose it's a

7

large question, if you are talking about, presumably,

8

the unusual cases in which the motion to reopen is -- is

9

justified, that you are talking about 2,000 or

10

3,000 cases, and the question is whether or not those

11

are -- should be reviewed in the executive branch or

12

should be reviewed in the judicial branch.

13

MS. LEITER:

Well, the math that we were

14

given earlier, I believe, does come out to about 2,000

15

appeals per year, but I remind the Court that section

16

1252(a)(2)(D) preserves those that raise questions of

17

law or constitutional questions for review.
So this is a far narrower -- I assume,

18
19

although I do not have the numbers, but I assume a far

20

narrower subset of those decisions that would be

21

rendered unreviewable here, only those for which a

22

discretionary factual determination has been made by the

23

agency.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So we are looking

MS. LEITER:

I -- I don't have the numbers,

2

Your Honor.

3

whether it's a fraction of the haystack or a needle

4

within it, but -- but it is certainly a subset of the --

5

of the category of cases.

6

I don't know what percent.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I am not sure

Do you have other

7

examples where -- “under” is commonly used -- statute

8

and regulations thereunder -- but in the appendix that

9

you have given us, it says, "under regulations."

10

“Under” is always coupled with “regulations,” and you

11

want us to transpose that to a statute that

12

conspicuously does not say, "regulations."

13

MS. LEITER:

Justice Ginsburg, we included

14

the appendix to illustrate how Congress uses the

15

preposition “under,” when it is talking about

16

regulations, so we specifically looked for examples

17

where Congress was talking already about regulations,

18

and the

19

preposition that accompanies that is always “under.”

20

I do have two further -- excuse me.

3

MS. LEITER:

4

other two are section 1227(a)(1)(H), which refers to

Turning to paragraph (5)(A) of section
1182(a), that calls for the Labor Department to

10

determine whether the United States needs immigrant

11

laborers in a particular category.
So, again, it's a use of the phrase

12
13

"specified under" to refer to statutory language, but

14

through the statutory language to what is clearly an

15

anticipated exercise of administrative discretion.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

Mr. Schoenfield, you have 3 minutes

16

Thank you, counsel.

remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICK M. SCHOENFIELD

18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19

MR. SCHOENFIELD:

Section 1252(b)(6)

20

mandates that review of the underlying decision should

21

be consolidated with review of a motion to reopen.

22

think that tells us several things.

23

I

The first and foremost of which is Congress

24

intended there to be review of motions to reopen -- at

25

least some motions to reopen.

To try to go back to

55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Justice Breyer's questions, I think one can extrapolate

2

from the consolidation provision that, if it is

3

impossible to consolidate because there is no review of

4

the underlying decision, you do not get to have a review

5

of those motions to reopen.

6

And that is referenced, I believe, in the

7

government's brief, at footnote 15 -- excuse me -- with

8

some cases cited, where courts have so held.

9

We did not focus on that because that is not

10

Mr. Kucana's issue.

11

Mr. Kucana's issue is the nature of asylum based upon

12

changed country conditions, and those situations are

13

where it may be a matter of life and death, certainly,

14

also a matter of -- of liberty, to be able to bring

15

forward new evidence, which did not exist before, about

16

changed country conditions, and it is not two bites at

17

the apple.

18

which is essential.

19

As the Court has alluded to,

It's the first bite at current conditions,

With regard to the case of Webster v. Doe,

20

that my colleague cited orally, that was an extremely

21

unusual case in which the Court essentially said that it

22

could not -- it did not have any criteria to evaluate

23

the discretion used by the director of the CIA.

24
25

That is certainly not the situation we have
here, where we are dealing with motions to reopen, which

56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

are analogous to rule 60(b) and which are routinely

2

reviewed on abuse-of-discretion standard.
Additionally, let me note that, if you were

3
4

to determine that the statutory language “specified

5

under” is ambiguous that the applicable canons both

6

point us to favoring judicial review -- favoring

7

judicial review and not essentially allowing the

8

Executive to pass a regulation which insulates itself

9

from judicial review.

10

That would be both the clear statement

11

requirement as well as the principle laid down by this

12

Court that, in an ambiguous situation dealing with

13

deportation, ambiguities are to be construed in favor of

14

the alien.

15

If there are no further questions --

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

MR. SCHOENFIELD:

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you, counsel.

Thank you.
Ms. Leiter, you have

19

briefed and argued this case in support of the judgment

20

below, at the invitation of the Court, and have ably

21

discharged that responsibility, for which we are

22

grateful.

23

The case is submitted.

24

(Whereupon, at 11:06 a.m., the case in the

25

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
