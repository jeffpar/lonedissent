Counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK H. COHEN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

10

MR. COHEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Plaintiff's counsel in this case earned a

11

large fee award based on prevailing market hourly rates

12

and a substantial number of hours expended.

13

However, the district court determined that

14

the $6 million lodestar was insufficient to compensate

15

them for the quality of their representation or their

16

results obtained.

17

This Court has previously held that factors,

18

such as novelty and complexity of the issues,

19

contingency, and superior performance cannot be used to

20

increase the lodestar amount because the factors are

21

subsumed within that determination.

22

But because of this Court's indication that,

23

in rare or exceptional circumstances, upward adjustments

24

may be permissible, district courts, such as the one

25

below, have used quality and results to increase
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

lodestar awards, even though the -- the multiplication

2

of the reasonable number of hours expended times the

3

reasonable hourly rate constitutes a fully compensatory

4

fee and serves the purpose of the statute, which is to

5

attract competent counsel without providing a windfall.

6

Now, with respect to quality of

7
8
9
10

representation, that normally involves two factors:
the skill and experience of the attorney, and also the
effort it takes to succeed in the case.
In this case, the lead counsel submitted

11

affidavits indicating that they sought hourly rates that

12

were within the prevailing market rates in the Atlanta

13

market; and, in fact, lead counsel's market rate, the

14

court found, was at the upper end of that market.

15

When the district court determined --

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

Could you

17

repeat what the market was?

18

attorneys or only for attorneys doing this type of work?

19

MR. COHEN:

Was it the market for all

It was the market for attorneys

20

with similar skill or experience doing similar work as

21

these counsel did.

22
23
24
25

So what the court --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What is similar -- what is

similar work?
MR. COHEN:

Similar work would be Federal

court work, where you -- involving class actions, for
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

example.

But the focus is mostly on the skill and

2

experience and reputation of the attorney.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

MR. COHEN:

Okay.

What the court did in this case,

5

though, was, rather than take those hourly rates, which

6

were prevailing, which the record was clear were

7

prevailing, the court determined the quality factor

8

justified an increase because they advanced case

9

expenses, because they were not paid on an ongoing

10

basis, and because their fees were contingent upon the

11

success of the case.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that has nothing to

13

do with the -- with the quality of the representation,

14

does it?

15

MR. COHEN:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, it doesn't, Your Honor.
Why didn't it name those

17

factors as -- as the determinative factors, instead of

18

saying, and therefore they should get more money for

19

quality?

20

MR. COHEN:

Well, for whatever reason, the

21

court determined to use contingency-related factors to

22

increase the fee award based on the quality factor.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

24

they advanced money for experts --

25

MR. COHEN:

Correct.
5

They advanced --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

contingency, which we rejected as a -- as a basis.

3

And what was the third one?

4

MR. COHEN:

5

And the third one was that they

weren't paid on an ongoing basis.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

MR. COHEN:

8
9
10
11

They weren't paid on --

That's right.

But that is not

a rare -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Isn't that -- isn't that

the same as contingency?
MR. COHEN:

Yes, it is, Your Honor, and it's

12

not a rare or exceptional circumstance when you're

13

talking about a fee-shifting statute.

14

The

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Cohen, I thought this

15

judge, Judge Shoob, said:

16

good; I have never seen a better performance.

17

we take him at his word?

18

about the quality of the performance of these lawyers.

19

MR. COHEN:

These lawyers were amazingly
So don't

I mean, he certainly talked

He did say that they exhibited

20

the best skill and professionalism, Justice Ginsburg,

21

that he had seen in his time on the bench.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

23

MR. COHEN:

24
25

Yes.

But I would submit to you that

that is not a reason to enhance the lodestar because -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How about you get a

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

second-year associate whose billing rate for 2 years

2

of experience is $200, and a partner's rate is $500, and

3

a judge says:

4

2-year associate; he did the quality and kind of work of

5

someone far superior in years in skill and experience.

6
7
8
9

This individual didn't perform like a

That would not, under your argument, entitle
the court to give an enhancement?
MR. COHEN:

No, it wouldn't, Your Honor,

because, if that $200-an-hour associate was doing other

10

work for other clients, the bill would be for $200 an

11

hour, regardless of what the result would have been or

12

how good that associate would have been.

13

It's basically --

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Cohen, you said in

15

your brief that, in such a case, the prevailing party

16

could argue that counsel should obtain a higher hourly

17

rate in the litigation than the customary rate he or she

18

charges in other cases, and that's the situation Justice

19

Sotomayor inquired about.

20

But that sounds to me -- you take the

21

second-year associate, pay him at the rate of the top

22

partner because her performance was so outstanding.

23

That’s an enhancement, but it isn't as transparent as

24

the one that Judge Shoob gave.

25

But you -- this suggestion -- maybe you are
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

going to retreat from it -- that it would be appropriate

2

to take the second-year associate and pay at a higher

3

hourly rate than the customary rate for that associate.

4

MR. COHEN:

What I meant by that position in

5

the brief, Your Honor, was that, in presenting

6

affidavits to support the hourly rate of that associate,

7

that associate may present hourly affidavits that the

8

rate was between $200 and $300 per hour, and the judge

9

could determine, because of how good he did, I'm going

10

to give him at the upper end of that market.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

with my hypothetical.

13

second-year associate.

14

lawyer.

15

experience.

16

And --

But you haven't dealt

He didn't perform like a
He performed like a 15-year

The difference is not with respect to skill and
It's with respect to performance.
And so what Justice Ginsburg was asking is,

17

what you are basically saying, the quality of that

18

representation, even though it reflected more than the

19

market one would look at objectively on the basis of the

20

years of experience, that judge can't enhance, even

21

though someone performed far above whatever else the

22

market would consider his or her skills at the moment.

23

MR. COHEN:

Well, remember, Your Honor,

24

that, when the statute was enacted, it was said in the

25

congressional reports that they wanted to compensate for
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the expenditure of time and to reimburse the plaintiff,

2

if you will, for what the plaintiff put out in terms of

3

expenses and fees.

4

Well, if you are -- if you are going to

5

basically treat that second-year associate as a 15-year

6

partner and award him a $500-an-hour rate, what you are

7

actually doing is overcompensating that person for what

8

the expenditure of time was and for what the actual fee

9

they would have charged to their client was.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I suppose the

11

question under the statute is whether it would be a

12

reasonable attorney's fee, and I guess one way to

13

determine that is to ask whether it would be considered

14

reasonable if a law firm that billed a client according

15

to their regular hourly rates came in and said, but

16

we're going to kick it up another -- you know, another

17

$10,000 because this -- this second-year associate, boy,

18

he's a whiz, and he performed like a senior partner.

19

we are going to -- we are billing him at the $500 rate,

20

instead of the $200.

21

a reasonable attorney's fee?

22

Would -- would that be considered

MR. COHEN:

No, it wouldn't --

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24

MR. COHEN:

25

So

I didn’t think so.

-- and no reasonable law firm

would do that, which is why a judge would be beyond his
9

discretion -- or her discretion --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They get

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why can't the judge

determine a reasonable fee in the same way the market
does?

Which is -MR. COHEN:

That's not the -- I'm sorry.

12

That’s not the traditional market, Your Honor.

13

traditional market is the hourly rate that’s envisioned

14

by the lodestar.

15

private fee agreements into fee-shifting statutes.

16

That's what this Court has said.

17
18

The

We don't replicate all possible

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, but the -- but the

Congress didn't use the per-hour lodestar --

19

MR. COHEN:

No.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- as the method.

If

21

that's all it wanted, it could have, and there were

22

suggestions that it consider limiting the -- the award

23

to just a lodestar calculation.

24

was thinking of something broader than just that.

25

MR. COHEN:

So obviously Congress

Well, Congress was -10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That part of the market

anyway.

3

MR. COHEN:

4

Congress also was not thinking of

I'm sorry.

5

replicating all possible private fee arrangements

6

because they also indicated that the -- the amount of

7

the fee should not be dependent on a proportion of the

8

damage award.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, but that's why we

10

have held in our cases that it should be a rare and

11

exceptional circumstance.

12

engaged in is whether the quality of performance can

13

ever constitute that rare exception that would justify a

14

district court saying, you performed greater than what

15

the market would have valued you at before your

16

performance.

17

The difference that we are

That's really what the issue is.
MR. COHEN:

Well, that's -- in answer to

18

your hypothetical, again, in the market where you have

19

an hourly rate for an associate, that’s the hourly rate

20

that that client is going to be billed by that law firm,

21

and they are not going to have a results fee or a bonus

22

fee because that attorney happened to do better.

23

hourly rates --

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The

Counsel, this --

this brilliant second-year associate we are talking
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

about, the way these submissions to the Court are -- the

2

way they're presented, do they carve out her

3

contribution to a particular filing?

4

have looked at them they have something like, you know,

5

draft motion to dismiss, and the associate has 40 hours

6

and the junior partner has 10 hours and the senior

7

partner has 5 hours dedicated to that.

8
9

To the extent I

I mean, if the associate is doing -- in the
hypothetical, is doing work at the partner level, how do

10

you know that the brilliance isn't contributed by the 4

11

hours of the partner rather than the 40 hours of the

12

associate?

13
14

MR. COHEN:

You don't in the traditional way

of billing that you are talking about, Your Honor.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Or, indeed, you don't know

16

that the brilliance of the second-year associate enables

17

the $500-an-hour partner to spend less time on the

18

matter.

19

comes to him, he doesn't have to do much work.

20

Presumably it does.

MR. COHEN:

It's so great when it

Well, that's true, Your Honor.

21

The other thing to point out is that when the

22

submissions are made to the court, they are supposed to

23

be broken down by tasks actually.

24

court considered the submissions not by what lawyer did

25

what task, but how many hours were expended on

And here the district

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

individual tasks.

2

And when the court determined to actually

3

lower the amount because of excessive hours, they looked

4

at tasks and said, for summary judgment, for example,

5

too many hours were expended.

6

doesn't normally look at lawyer doing particular tasks.

7

It looks at tasks being done by the lawyers in general.

8
9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So they -- the court

It is not clear to

me what the district judge should do in making the

10

lodestar calculation when he considers quality of

11

performance.

12

you have already said --

13

of performance, but only within the confines of what is

14

a reasonable rate.

I guess you are saying -- I think maybe
that he can consider quality

15

MR. COHEN:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's correct, Your Honor.
Because the brief for the

17

Respondent said:

18

counting this at the front end, and if you can do that,

19

why not put it in at the back end?

20

problems with that still.

21

outset said:

22

that, so far as the lodestar is concerned, I think a

23

reasonable fee is above the usual hourly rate.

24
25

Well, you know, you are really

And I'm just having

Suppose the judge at the

2

range of the market is for that area.

at the number of hours reasonably expended.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

He's also looking

But -- so that in

5

computing the lodestar rate, he cannot consider quality

7

MR. COHEN:

Quality of performance is built

8

within, I would say subsumed within, the hourly rate and

9

the number of hours expended, as this Court has said in

10

Delaware Valley I.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, then it seems to me

12

you're saying that he does not look to actual quality of

13

performance.

14

reference to that.

He just looks to market rates without
I -- I --

15

MR. COHEN:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but -That's why I'm having --

17

I'm -- I mean, you know, the -- the question presented

18

is -- is just quality of performance and results

19

obtained; that's all we're talking about.

20

MR. COHEN:

Correct.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And --

And I don't see why that

22

can't be considered as part of the lodestar, and if it

23

can be, then I don't see what the argument is about.

24
25

MR. COHEN:

But superior performance is just

the reason that hourly rates are what they are.
14

That's

what this Court said in Pierce v. Underwood.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But not necessarily –But does that -- does that

4

mean that the fee would be the same under the lodestar

6

MR. COHEN:

The -- the lawyer

doesn't get a fee in a fee-shifting statute if he loses.

8
9

Well, no.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But if for some reason, if

-- if you did had some reason to calculate it,

10

theoretically it would be the same fee as if he had

11

lost?

12

MR. COHEN:

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

14

performance really is totally irrelevant.

15

MR. COHEN:

That's correct.

That's correct.

And so the quality of

As it is for the normal lawyer

16

working on a private matter for a client.

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

18

MR. COHEN:

Right.

They get paid an hourly rate and

19

it's win or lose.

20

is to say, well, I need to give them a little extra

21

because their winning this case was dependent upon a

22

contingency, and the factors that he built into that

23

enhancement were contingency-related factors.

24
25

And what the judge tried to do here

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But we are going back to

the judge, who did say that this was the best
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

performance he ever saw.

2

was just contingency.

So I can't credit just that it

3

But, first, you have clarified that what you

4

said in your brief meant only the top range for a lawyer

5

of this, period.

6

one might take it to be.

7

So this is more limited than -- than

In some circuits, like the D.C. Circuit, the

8

rate is set by the number of years that the person is

9

out of law school, and there isn't any flexibility.

I

10

mean, you give the 1-year associate so much, the 5-year

11

associate so much.

12

you take into account quality at all?

13

So how in a system like that could

MR. COHEN:

Well, but in the normal system,

14

Your Honor -- and I would ask to reserve some time for

15

rebuttal -- that that hourly rate that that first-year

16

or second-year associate gets is the rate that they bill

their clients.

they have a special fee arrangement, as -- as Justice

appropriate.

Justice Sotomayor, if I can address your

12

concern about these alternative arrangements that --

13

that occur in -- that are starting to emerge -- at least

14

Respondents suggest in their brief to this Court by

15

citing a few newspaper articles and the proverbial word

16

on the street that these are an emerging trend.

17

First of all, there’s no -- absolutely no

18

evidence in the record in this case that those type of

19

arrangements were available in the relevant market.

20

even if they were, those sort of alternative

21

arrangements are essentially modified contingency

arrangements.

Two responses, Your Honor:

2

First, the problem that you posit about attorneys

3

having -- being deterred by having to absorb, you know,

4

5

or to having absorbed the contingency risks, those are

6

problems created by this Court's precedent in Dague, not

7

before this Court now.

MR. SHAH:

No one in this case has asked the

Court to revisit Dague.

16

But more -- more to the point of your

17

question, the type -- even accepting Respondents'

18

formulation of this enhancement, it would only be

19

available in the rare and exceptional case.

20

reasonable attorney making an ex ante determination to

21

whether to take on a representation would rely on the

22

speculative and remote possibility that the district

23

judge is going to have found this to be one of the best

24

cases he has ever seen in making that calculation.

25

And no

Respondents' own numbers suggest that these

Alderson Reporting Company

1

are granted less than one time -- once a year.

2

suggests that no reasonable attorney would take that

3

into consideration, and it does not, in fact, further

4

the statutory purpose in that event of attracting

5

competent counsel.

6

That

I would like to make one last point, and

7

this is to bring us back to the facts of this case.

I

8

think Respondents' own trial counsel -- the discussion

9

that they give of the lodestar rates used in this case I

10

think is particularly telling.

11

affidavit of Marcia Lowry, who was the lead plaintiff’s

12

trial counsel, and this was submitted during the fee-

13

setting hearing, and the relevant excerpt appears on

14

page 41 of the Joint Appendix.

15

paragraph 25, and here's what she has to say about the

16

rates used by the court:

17

And this is the

And I want to read from

"The standard hourly rates reflected in

18

Exhibit 2" -- and those are the rates used by the

19

district court -- "are fair, reasonable and consistent

20

with the hourly rates in the Atlanta market for the

21

price of legal services of comparable quality rendered

22

in cases demanding similar skill, judgment, and

23

performance."

24
25

Now, the affidavit goes on to say that the
rates are still too low for the other factors that
26

Mr. Cohen discussed -- contingency risk, delayed

payment, expert fees -- but not for attorney

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

Thank you, counsel.

Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Clement.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Let me begin with the colloquy that involved

12

Justices Ginsburg and Justice Kennedy about the rates

13

and whether you can have sort of pre-enhanced rates as

14

part of the lodestar or whether you can only do the

15

enhancement after the fact.

16

At the end of the day, as long as it is

17

established in this case that you can have an

18

enhancement for quality, I suppose that my -- my clients

19

would be satisfied.

20

preexisting law in the Eleventh Circuit and most

21

circuits does not allow for a pre-enhanced rate to be

22

used to calculate the lodestar.

23

completely mechanically, as Justice Ginsburg suggests --

24

dollars from the taxpayers of Georgia and -- and awards

12

But it seems totally standardless, and I see no way of

13

policing it, and I see a great danger that trial judges

14

are going to use this as a way of favoring their

15

favorite nonprofit foundation or their favorite cause or

16

generally do good work.

13

party, but you shouldn't -- you shouldn't be compensated

attorney is the best one I've seen in 28 years.

don't think -- I don't think we should set up a

6

mechanism that induces them to do it.

7

MR. CLEMENT:

This is the worst performance I have seen in
Judges don't do that in our system, and I

Well, two things, Your Honor.

8

I mean, the results obtained is one of the two factors

9

that are at issue in this case.

And I think results

10

obtained can be objective and be a basis for an upward

11

adjustment as well as a downward adjustment.

12

As you heard the lawyer in the earlier case

13

say, you know, in a complaint, it is a wish list.

14

it's a rare case where the attorney gets everything they

15

ask for in the complaint.

16

everything that was asked for in the complaint was

17

obtained.

18

And

This is that rare case where

So that's one factor, Your Honor.

2

doesn't get a multiplier.

3

The results obtained under our theory should

4

be what the law requires, and not different results

5

because you have different lawyers.

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I

7

mean, I defer to you, but I'm not sure that comports

with my experience.

9

I have seen lawyers come into this

10

seen that prominently featured in this Court's opinion,

11

so it does seem to me that sometimes the quality of the

12

performance and the results obtained do depend on the

13

lawyer's performance and are not foreordained just by

14

the four corners of the complaint.

15

And so I think, again --

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but what does

17

a judge say when he said, you have achieved

18

extraordinary results?

would have made a mistake on the law?

One is, less than 10 percent of the total

9

10

top-of-the-market rates.

11

compensated, at sort of $495 and $450 an hour.

12

Only the two lead counsel were

If you want to talk about the -- the Lowry

13

declaration, which is one thing that Mr. Shah brought

14

up, what he quoted from was essentially the conclusion

15

of that, where as part of the existing Eleventh Circuit

16

precedent that looks to prevailing rates in the Atlanta

17

market, there is a recitation that that is the sort of

18

the prevailing rate consistent with the quality.

19

essentially something that the Eleventh Circuit

20

requires you to say.

That’s

21

I think the more relevant part of that

22

declaration is at Joint Appendix at page 35, where

23

Ms. Lowry points out that as a matter of fact these

24

rates in the Atlanta market do nothing to account for

25

the fact that she has to pay New York overhead, and that

percent of the taxpayers hope to see in their lives, and

let me take issue, though, with the hypothetical that

all these lawyers are getting the top, top rate.

14

not -- that's not what is happening, either in this case

15

or in general.

16

That's

And one of the things, if you look out at

17

the circuits, you will see that, because this Court has

18

always said that the lodestar method is a two-step

19

process, the first step, as this Court has repeatedly

20

described it, is an estimate.

21

circuits have some looseness as to how they go about

22

estimating the reasonable hourly rate.

23

Let's take the tippy-tip-top rate and use that to

calculate the rate.

The reason is, if you take that off the

question about whether the Congress that passed the

statute intended for there to be bonuses or enhancements

10

This is not a difficult

Those of you that look to legislative

continue to do that because you are interpreting a word

like “reasonable,” and I think have you to look

somewhere, and the -- and the Senate report provides

guidance.

11

The second thing though is, Justice Scalia,

12

you, in a number of contexts, have pointed out that, if

13

you don't look to legislative history, it's okay to look

14

at how a term was interpreted by courts at the time that

Congress adopted it.

result, which is, in this is case --

at the fact that, in the early 1970s, when this was

MR. CLEMENT:

I suspect that's true, but I

MR. CLEMENT:

because, again, what Congress said it was trying to do

here was not to try to make people indifferent between

whether they became lawyers or not.

11

They were looking at lawyers and they were

trying to determine, we want to essentially make you

indifferent between engaging in civil rights work and

other complex civil litigation, like antitrust, and if

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. CLEMENT:

But not before the lower

courts had adopted the lodestar, and which way does that

I think that cuts very strongly against adopting a rule

that says, the lodestar is not just a guiding principle

but is an absolute ceiling on the award.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

account the excellence of counsel.

guidance, you can look to the early Third Circuit cases

that were decided before Congress passed the statute,

18

and what those Third Circuit cases decided -- there was

19

an en banc case, Lindy II, by Judge Aldisert and a panel

20

opinion in Merola by Judge Garth.

21

And what those decisions did is they said

22

the great thing about having a lodestar with adjustments

23

is that, in the mine run of cases, the rates are going

24

to get quality of performance results about right.

point in your brief that the -- that legal fees are

MR. CLEMENT:

Are they

Well, I think, right now, they

are sort of, at best, staying stagnant and maybe going

down a little bit.

8

to the market in setting rates a bit.

9

I think this Court has always looked

I think the main thing the fact that

10

rates are not going up in sort of an inevitable cycle

11

suggests to me is that this Court has to recognize that

12

the one basis for enhancement that it has already

13

consistently recognized, which is an enhancement for

14

delay, which is not the same thing as contingency.

15

This Court recognized that enhancement for

16

delay was appropriate in the case of Missouri v.

17

Jenkins.

18

account for delay, either through current rates, instead

19

of historical rates, or through an enhancement.

Now, this Court indicated that you can take

20

I think the one thing we know now is you

21

have to be careful about using current rates to take

22

into account for delay because the assumption that that

23

would work was based on this assumption that rates

24

inevitably go up.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
44
Alderson Reporting Company

There is a flip side

1

to the unpopular case situation the S.G. talked about,

which is lawyers and law firms sometimes take on a

3

particular high-profile case to increase their profile,

4

and they would have done it for a lot less.

5

We have lawyers who argue here, who are

6

doing it for free, because it's a big deal to be

recognized as doing something in the Supreme Court.

8

when you use prevailing rates with respect to that type

of work, you are overcompensating them.

your arguments are suggesting that the counter -- that

about -- whether the person's a national attorney with

18

overhead or whether that person's a -- has done better

19

work -- the example I used, a second-year associate,

you a grounded place to make a judgment about the

exercise of a court's discretion.

23

structured, more --

24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

Why isn't that a more

Well, I guess what I would

say, Justice Sotomayor, is that that potentially could
46
Alderson Reporting Company

1

be more structured.

2

which is to say I think -- you know, in some ways, it

3

may be more transparent to say, we are just going to use

4

the Laffey index, or we are going to use the prevailing

5

market rates, and then we are really going to hone in on

6

the issue of quality and exceptional results after the

7

fact.

8

I'm not sure it inherently is,

I think, if the Court wants to suggest that

9

you should take those factors into account in setting

10

the rate -- and the rate should not be just a rigidly

11

calculated rate that comes from an index or comes from

12

the prevailing market -- I think the one thing I would

13

very much want to urge on you is, if you take that

14

route, that you allow a remand for an opportunity for my

15

clients to make that showing to the district court

16

because there’s no question, from the record here, that

17

they were responding to extant law of the Eleventh

Circuit.

standard list enhancements, so one question is when do

5

you enhance? Another is, in this case it was 75 percent.

6

How do you know what's the right multiplier?

7

That -- the concern is you are going to have

8

variations from district judge to district judge in how

9

good the performance was, in what is the appropriate

10

multiplier.

11

this from becoming just random, just rudderless?

12

Are there any handles that would prevent

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, first

13

let me say that I had understood, and perhaps this was

14

wishful thinking, but I had understood that Justice

15

Sotomayor was suggesting the possibility of a broader

16

inquiry at the rate-setting stage, not just a narrow

17

focus sort of within bands.

18

was trying to respond to.

So I just -- that's what I

As to trying to cabin the discretion, let me

19
20

try to offer some thoughts about cabining the

21

discretion, but let me also say that, to paraphrase

22

Justice Scalia, what sauce for the goose is sauce for

23

24

bases for downward departures, and including downward

25

departures all the way to zero in Farrar v. Hobby, and

I mean, this Court has said that there are

48

the Court has not been overly concerned about cabining

2

that discretion.

9

about cabining the discretion.

10

It can take place in the terms of looking

There are a

Now, if this Court wants to cabin the

11

discretion, I think certainly there’s two factors here:

12

There’s the quality of service and there is the

13

exceptional results.

14

would certainly say that you ought not to have a rigid

15

rule, which is essentially what Petitioners are asking

16

for, that would cap you with prevailing market rates.

17

There ought to be some flexibility for that,

18

for the judge to take into account the actual experience

19

that the judge has with the lawyers in the courtroom.

20

The second thing I would say is that I do

As to the quality of service, I

21

think it ought to be fair, if you are going to do this

22

kind of calculation, that you don't base it on something

23

like the Laffey index, and you don't base it on a rule

24

that a national expert can never get a national

25

prevailing rate, but even though they are sitting in New
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

York, they have to get the top rate only in the Atlanta

2

market.

3

account on the compensation side of things.

I think those differences should be taken into

4

And then if at some point, the judge wants

5

to say, and I want to give either this rate or this

6

multiplier for the quality of the performance, then

7

that's something that you can certainly assess.

8
9

As to the exceptional results, I also think
there, too, you can focus on specific factors of the

10

case before you, and you can say things.

11

say, for example in this case, part of the reason the

12

results are exceptional -- I would point to at least three

13

things:

14

take on a case of this breadth and undertaking is really

an exceptional undertaking.

There was still, though, I

3

should say, something on the order of $750,000 in

4

reimbursable expenses that had to be advanced.

5

worth pointing out that one factor that Judge Shoob took

6

into account in giving an enhancement here was the delay

7

in payment.

8

Missouri v. Jenkins, and even if you use current rates,

9

that doesn't do anything to compensate you for the delay

10

It’s

That is a permissible factor under

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

client doesn't mean that they are going to pay or that

15

16

think the rates are set to take into account that over

17

the past year whatever you have a realization rate

18

of -- whatever, 80 percent or 85 percent.

19

I think rates are set with -- based on a law

MR. CLEMENT:

And I

Oh, I was just making a narrow

20

point, Mr. Chief Justice, which is the current rates

21

don't take into account the fact that there was a delay

22

in repayment for reimbursable expenses.

23

expenses were paid out 4 years ago, I mean at the

So that is one thing Judge Shoob thought ought to

Again, that’s one factor that makes this

6

exceptional.

7

entrenched problem that they were dealing with.

8

the foster care child system in Georgia was described as

9

a crisis; by 1996 it had been upgraded to a catastrophe.

10
11

Another factor is that this was an
In 1989

This is a very difficult problem.
The last thing is the scope of the relief,

12

which really is, I think, very broad here and that's what

13

Judge Shoob was recognizing.

14

think in an era of coupon settlements, a judge is

15

entitled to look at a case like this and say this is

16

really a remarkable result that has been achieved here,

17

and the normal rates -- normal prevailing market rates

18

don't compensate for this kind of result.

19

And as I said earlier, I do

So I do think there are things that the

20

Court could point to in this case or in other cases to

21

try to cabin that discretion.

22

discretion is an inherent feature of this statutory

23

regime, and this Court has tolerated a degree of

24

discretion in a variety of contexts including with

25

respect in the area of downward departures.

I do think, though, that

52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I do want to get, before I sit down, this

2

point about getting the incentives right, because one

3

thing that Congress was clearly very concerned about was

4

getting the incentive rights for counsel.

5

accept Petitioner's position that the lodestar is a

6

ceiling and not something that is subject to adjustment

7

up or down, then what you are telling lawyers is the

8

that the maximum amount they can make in a civil rights

9

case is the minimum amount they can make in a different

10

case, where by the way they will get paid every 30 days

11

and their expenses will get reimbursed in real time.

12

Then you are also telling them something

And if you

13

else, which is, that's actually just a starter because

14

there are multiple ways for district courts to cut down

15

on the lodestar amount, either because you spent too

16

much time on this or we didn't like your travel

17

expenditures.

18

hours to be cut down.

19

And so there are multiple ways for those

If you accept Petitioner's rule and there is

20

no way to get those rates bumped up in any

21

circumstances, then you are basically guaranteeing that,

22

as I say, the maximum you can make in a civil rights is

23

the minimum you can make in any other kind of cases.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They say you

Two things, Mr. Chief -So it's the same--

7

it's the same thing that happens when a district court

8

looks at the -- the lodestar and cuts it down.

9

MR. CLEMENT:

Two things, Mr. Chief Justice:

10

One, it's the law of the Eleventh Circuit and I think

11

every circuit that before submitting your fees to the

12

court you are supposed to use billing judgment and take

13

care of some of those things, approximating maybe what

14

your client would do for you.

15

more tellingly, the client may do that to you.

16

client doesn't have the help of your opposing counsel to

17

egg them on and give them suggestions, and that's what a

18

district court does in the context of one of these

19

cases.

20

But, second, and I think
The

So I really think, as a practical matter,

21

you are systematically undercompensating counsel.

23

am not here to reargue the Dague case, but if you want

24

to talk about practicalities, the fact that all of these

25

cases are contingency cases and the rational market for

And I

1

those would be much higher than -- if you are worried

2

about sort of windfalls for plaintiff counsel in

3

these kind of cases, you really can worry about

4

something else, with all due respect, because the

5

combined effect of Dague and Casey makes it very

6

difficult to get sort of comparable compensation.

7

As I say, I am not here to reargue those

8

cases.

I do think, frankly, Dague is distinguishable

9

because there you had the prevailing party language.

10

The other thing about Dague that’s distinguishable that

11

I will say before I sit down is one of this Court's

12

concerns in Dague was creating an asymmetry.

13

had already said that contingency fees could not cap

14

your awards; they didn't want to have an asymmetrical

15

system.

16

for, is a completely asymmetrical system.

17

Hobby says you can reduce downwards based on

18

exceptionally poor results.

19

whatsoever to even adjust a little bit under their rule

20

for exceptional results on the upside.

That's exactly what Petitioners are asking you

Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK H. COHEN
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

2

MR. COHEN:

Than you, Your Honor.

3

I would like to start out with the little

4

joke that Mr. Clement made, is that you get what you pay

5

for.

6

getting paid half my hourly rate in this case means I

7

exert

8

half of what I would do for another client who would pay

9

my full rate?

You do get what you pay for.

No.

Is because I am

Because my professional

10

responsibility is that when I’m hired by a client for

11

an hourly rate, I’m supposed to represent that client

12

zealously within the bounds of the law.

13

So to say that in a case like this that

14

these lawyers would have done a different type of job

15

had they not known there was a possibility of a quality

16

enhancement is an insult, frankly, to Ms. Lowry and her

17

group, because they do this all the time.

18

without getting an enhancement; they never asked for one

19

before.

20

quality enhancement is going to be available even in

21

rare or exceptional circumstances, you are going to have

22

arbitrary results and you are going to have

23

inconsistency which the analytical part of the lodestar

24

guards against.

25

They do it

And, clearly, if this Court determines that a

Second point I would make is that Mr.
56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Clement mentioned about the New York rates and the

2

overhead.

3

court's awarding a quality -- or an enhancement here.

4

That was not part of it at all.

5

That was not the rationale for the district

Getting back to what the court has

6

mentioned:

"The best lawyer I have ever seen."

7

what the purpose of this fee-shifting statute is.

8

to attract competent counsel by awarding them a

9

reasonable fee.

Look at
It's

What attorney is going -- who wouldn't

10

normally take a civil rights case is going to say:

11

Maybe I will take it, because maybe the judge will say

12

I'm the best he's ever seen or one of the best I've ever

13

seen?

14

attract competent counsel.

15

civil rights case because they know if they prevail they

16

are going to get their prevailing market rate, they are

17

going to get all their hours, their reasonable number of

18

hours put in.

19

3-year period.

It's not a rational reason to give out there to

And they got their reasonable rates.

The judge also double-counted for quality

21

because Ms. Lowry got a $495 rate in part because of

22

her, quote, "stellar performance," as the district judge

23

decided.

24

enhancement is impermissible double-counting, as this

25

Court has held in previous cases, including Delaware

So to count that again by giving an

2

Finally, I would say that the district

3

judge's order in this case, if left undisturbed, will

4

create additional applications for enhancements and

5

whether they are granted or not, as Justice O'Connor

6

pointed out in the Delaware Valley II case in her

7

concurrence, it's not the issue of the rarity of the

8

granting of the enhancement.

9

requesting of it.

The issue is the

And the requests are going to come

10

out the wazoo, and district courts are going to be

11

deciding things arbitrarily and on different bases.

12
13

And for those reasons, we would respectfully
urge this Court to reverse.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask this one final

15

question:

16

there’s an absolute ceiling here.

17

We have a question of law before us, whether

Am I justified in assuming that if we could

18

reach the question of whether it was a reasonable

19

enhancement, there’s no argument about that?

20
21
22

MR. COHEN:

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

If you

determine that the enhancement was -JUSTICE STEVENS:

We are assuming for

23

purposes of decision that the enhancement was

24

reasonable, if that was -- if it's ever available,

In other

words, you are making an argument of law.

3

same issue before us.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That is not the question

presented in the cert petition.
MR. COHEN:

Well, no, I understand that.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If I understand it, the

11

question of law presented is that even if the

12

enhancement had only been $1,000 --
