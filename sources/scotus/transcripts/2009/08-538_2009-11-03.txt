ORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG G. GOLDBLATT

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

10

The debtor in this case claimed, in the

11

third column of Schedule C, a $10,718 exempt interest in

12

her kitchen equipment.

13

fully proper.

14

it was unobjectionable.

That claim of exemption was

The trustee did not object to it because

The debtor's position here is that because

15
16

of what she wrote in the fourth column, where she

17

estimated the value of the equipment as the same amount

18

of the exemption, that her claim of exemption itself

19

should be read to say something different from and

20

greater than what it actually says.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Goldblatt, I thought

22

that what she said -- I'm looking at Schedule C,

23

property claimed as exempt.

24

claimed as exempt, "See attached list of business

25

equipment."

She lists, as property

And then we have an inventory going for

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

several handwritten pages of all these items of kitchen

2

equipment.

3

claimed as exempt.

4

And that's what she says is the property

MR. GOLDBLATT:

With respect, Justice

5

Ginsburg, that's incorrect.

6

C, which is in the joint appendix at pages 57 and 58a,

7

the first column is a description of the property, and

8

the third column contains the value of the claimed

9

exemption.

10

If you turn to her Schedule

The property claimed as exempt here is the

11

$10,718 interest in the asset listed in column A.

And

12

the reason that's clear, Your Honor, it's clear from the

13

language of the statute itself because the statutory

14

language of 522(l) provides that the debtor files a list

15

of property that the debtor claims as exempt and that,

16

unless a party in interest objects, the property claimed

17

as exempt is exempt.
522(l) refers to the property claimed as

18
19

exempt under subsection (b), and subsection (b) in turn

20

references subsection (d), which is the basis for the

21

claim of exemption here.
And 522(d), when it describes the exemption,

22
23

says the following:

"The following property may be

24

exempted:

25

exceed $18,450 in property" -- it goes -- and it

One, the debtor's aggregate interest, not to

enumerates a series of exemptions.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But she -- in her

3

inventory, she gives figures, and they add up to the

4

amount that she's claiming, so she evidently thinks that

5

those numbers will cover all of her business equipment.

6

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Justice Ginsburg, it may --

7

that may well be true.

She may -- the debtor here may

8

well have believed that the value of the equipment here

9

was equal to the amount of the exemption.

But no one

10

contends in any serious way that the trustee is required

11

to object to the debtor's valuation of the equipment.

12

After all --

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. -- Mr. Goldblatt,

14

this is -- this is really my concern.

15

wants is her cooking equipment, not the money

16

equivalent.

17

have said:

18

equipment is worth more than the value that I put down,

19

I'll cut out the coffee maker, I'll cut out the

20

microwave; but what I want is the equipment, not the

21

dollar -- dollars for it.

22

It seems what she

And if the trustee had objected, she could
Well, if they think that this cooking

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Your Honor, the debtor here

23

may well have wanted the equipment.

24

is, did she make a claim on her schedule that the

25

equipment was itself exempt in kind?

5

I'm entitled to here is a $10,718 interest in my

6

equipment.

7

turns out that I'm wrong and it's worth more, I don't

8

want any more than the Bankruptcy Code gives me.

9

They can write, "I
Here, take --

Look, all I want is the
I understand that all

I think my equipment is worth that.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If it

Well, that would be

10

a remarkable coincidence if her equipment happened to be

11

worth exactly what Congress said she could exempt, which

12

is a very odd way of reading what she's put in the

13

schedule.

14

MR. GOLDBLATT:

We -- Mr. Chief Justice, we

15

think the most natural way to read what she has said in

16

the schedule is that she's claiming exactly what she

17

says, which is that she is claiming a $10,718 interest

18

in the property.

19

To get to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I would have thought

20

the most natural way of reading it is that she's

21

claiming the equipment because she thinks that's the

22

value of the equipment.

23

MR. GOLDBLATT:

If she wanted to claim the

24

equipment itself as exempt, there were a number of ways

25

that one could do that.

She could say:

6
Alderson Reporting Company

I claim 100

Official

1

percent interest in the equipment; I claim an in-kind

2

interest.

3

there is no suggestion that has been made by anyone that

4

she has any entitlement to an in-kind exemption in the

5

equipment.

6

Here it would be odd to read that, because

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Where would she say that,

7

100 percent interest in the equipment?

8

that in -- in column 3?

9
10

MR. GOLDBLATT:

In either column -- yes, in

column 3.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

11
12

Would she say

Column 3 says "Value of

claimed exemption."

13

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Debtors can certainly list

14

in the schedule.

15

claim an interest in the property itself.

16

because --

17

They can list an asterisk and say:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Here the --

Well, I mean, you say that.

18

But, boy, I wouldn't read -- I wouldn't read the -- I

19

wouldn't read the -- the chart that way.

MR. GOLDBLATT:

-- which is exactly what the

trustee proposes to give her.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Right.
That claim of exemption was

5

proper.

In response to Justice Ginsburg's fair

6

question, which is what -- what is a debtor to do here

7

if she wants equipment itself, the debtor is surely

8

entitled, Justice Ginsburg, to -- if the trustee seeks

9

to sell the equipment at auction, to participate in that

10

auction and to credit-bid her exemption.

11

one disputes that.

12

come to the auction and say, look, I'm bidding my

13

exemption, and that will buy me as much of my equipment

14

as it will buy me, the debtor is fully entitled to do

15

that.

16

And no -- no

So if the -- if the debtor wants to

And in that -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then you're going through

17

all the administrative expenses of having an auction

18

where if the trustee had tipped her off, it would be

19

like amending your pleading.

20

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Well, in fairness, in this

21

case itself, the trustee happened to come to the section

22

341 meeting and say:

23

for the estate.

24
25

I believe that there's value here

I think there's value in excess of --

want my cooking equipment.

2

MR. GOLDBLATT:

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

That's right, but –It was very clear that

that's what the debtor wanted.

5

MR. GOLDBLATT:

And it was equally clear

6

that the trustee took the position that she was entitled

7

to the exemption that Congress permits and no more than

8

that.

And the debtor didn't say --

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The question is whether

10

-- the question is whether the trustee had to make an

11

objection, when it seemed really as clear as could be

12

that what she was seeking was to keep her equipment, not

13

to get the -- some monetary equivalent for it.
MR. GOLDBLATT:

14

With respect, Justice

15

Ginsburg, imagine you had a debtor who -- who came into

16

court and said:

17

something equal to the amount that is permissible, that

18

I may permissibly claim as exempt, but I don't mean to

19

make an improper in-kind exemption.

creditors.

All I want is what I'm entitled to by

That debtor would have no alternative way to
express that but to do exactly what this debtor did

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

here.

2

-- is to read it to have this debtor be expressing an

3

intention that is consistent with law and not one that

4

is improper.

5

this debtor is entitled to keep more than a $10,718

6

interest, and under the ordinary presumption that you

7

presume parties --

8
9

And we think the most plausible way to read it is

There is -- there is no basis under which

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, then she has -- on

your reading, her claim is improper because she's

10

claiming more than she's entitled to.

11

improper, then the trustee has an obligation to object

12

to it.

13

MR. GOLDBLATT:

If her claim is

Justice Ginsburg, it's only

14

improper if it's read to mean something different from

15

what it says.

16

claim an exempt interest of $10,718 in the equipment,

17

and I believe the equipment is worth that amount.

18

question is, should that be read to be making an

19

improper claim that the equipment itself is exempt in

20

kind, a claim that would be -- would be clearly

21

improper, or --

22

What she said here in the schedule is:

JUSTICE ALITO:

The

When I look at that number,

23

I -- and maybe I don't understand this, so maybe you or

24

your adversary can clarify it for me.

25

at that number, it seems to me there are two ways to

3

That I want the value of my equipment, and it just so

happens to total exactly to the dollar the amount that

5

I'm entitled to by law.

6

two possible readings of that?

8

I want the

Am I correct that those are the

MR. GOLDBLATT:

That's -- that's certainly

-- we think that that's right.

9
10

One is that she is saying:

JUSTICE ALITO:

And the question is which of

those is the more plausible reading?
MR. GOLDBLATT:

11

Right, and we -- we think

12

that -- that for a number of reasons, the more plausible

13

reading is to say:

me.

15

proposition you wouldn't presume someone to be making a

16

claim for which there would be no legal basis.

17

any --

All I want is what the law permits

The -- the principal reason is that as a general

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

And in

Except that the -- that the

19

last column does -- it’s very clearly entitled "Current

20

market value of property" without deducting exemptions.

21

There's no way to read that last figure of 10,718 except

22

as her assessment of the market value of her cooking

23

equipment.

24
25

MR. GOLDBLATT:

That's exactly right,

Justice Scalia, but the critical point is that there is

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

no requirement that any trustee come in and object to a

2

valuation if the valuation is improper.

3

Imagine she had –-

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can you -- can you --

5

that was -- what you've just said, no requirement that

6

the trustee object to valuation, one of the briefs --

7

it may have been wrong, but it's the NACBA brief at page

8

27 -- said "Challenges to valuation are the most common

9

types of objections to exemptions."

10

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Let me -- let me explain

11

this for a moment, if I may.

12

had listed the value at $15,000 and her exempt interest

13

as 10,718.

14

would surely be entitled to sell the asset.

15

themselves acknowledges that on page 30 of the

16

Respondent's brief.

17

the equipment would obtain would be whatever a willing

18

buyer and willing seller would pay.

19

$15,000, it could be $30,000, it could be $130,000.

20

the fact that the actual value of what -- what a buyer

21

would pay for it was different from the debtor's

22

valuation would be of no moment.

23

trustee was able to obtain for the asset --

Justice Breyer.

5

6

MR. GOLDBLATT:

So we're never going

That's exactly right.

But

7

-- but the point here is that there is no requirement

8

that the -- when a debtor files an individual

9

bankruptcy case, on Schedule B the debtor lists the

10

valuation, their estimated valuation of all of their

11

assets.

12

Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Rules, or anywhere else

13

that a trustee go through and say whether they agree or

14

disagree with the debtor's positive valuation.

15

what a trustee does is they liquidate the asset, they

16

generate the value that is there, and they distribute

17

that value to creditors.

18

There is absolutely no requirement in the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Instead,

Well, they don't always

19

liquidate the asset, if they -- if they elect -- if

20

everybody agrees that they get the asset itself, they

21

don't have to sell it.

22

MR. GOLDBLATT:

That's exactly right.

The

23

trustee may determine to abandon an asset to the debtor

24

if there's no --

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What -- what -- what you

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

are doing there, you -- you argue that ambiguities are

2

construed against the person that made the form.

3

think that's a little harsh when the trustee is a repeat

4

player and knows -- and knows the rules.

5

MR. GOLDBLATT:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I

Well –On the other hand, I think

7

what you have going for you is that the trustee is going

8

to always be at risk that the asset is worth more than

9

what's listed and is going to have to take steps to

10

value it in every -- every case.
In this case, it's -- it's clear that she –-

11

she knew that the Honda was worth more.

She was only

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

And -- and if you take

17

that together with -- and -- and the kitchen equipment

18

comes next, and she -- and the value is the same in each

19

column.

20

full value.

21

So that indicates that she was claiming the

MR. GOLDBLATT:

With -- with respect to

22

the -- the automobile, there's -- there’s a claim of

23

exemption and the rest is subject to a security

24

interest.

25

debtor wants to -- to put to -- to the issue and say,

Here -- I mean, the critical point is if a

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

listen, I really want to keep the equipment itself, I

2

don't think there's any value here for the estate, there

3

is a statutory mechanism to address that.

4

554(b) says quite clearly that if -- if a party in

5

interest believes that there is an asset as to which

6

there is inconsequential value, they can seek an order

7

compelling the bankruptcy -- compelling the trustee to

8

abandon that asset to the debtor.

9

Section

So there is -- I mean, Justice Ginsburg's

10

question -- there is a mechanism for addressing the

11

concern that Your Honor has with a debtor who wants a

12

determination that they keep a particular asset, but --

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

My concern is keeping it

14

simple, giving fair notice to people.

debtor is claiming all of the -- that particular

19

property.

trustee when he has to object, and the end of the

21

matter.

22

She's got the
A

It says when the two columns have the

That's a nice, simple rule.

MR. GOLDBLATT:

It tells the

With respect, Justice

23

Ginsburg, a -- a simpler rule would be that if a

24

debtor wants to say, I have an in-kind exemption in an

25

asset, the debtor should say that.

15
Alderson Reporting Company

They should use a

Official

1

term that is understood to mean that.

2
3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it's not in kind in

the sense that she keeps the asset no matter what.

4

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Well, that's exactly what

5

the debtor is contending here.

6

is saying that this -- this said even if I'm wrong

7

about the value --

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

She -- the debtor here

She is contending that

she would like to keep her cooking equipment and she was

10

entitled to notice before it's going to be sold at an

11

auction.

12

MR. GOLDBLATT:

With respect, Justice

13

Ginsburg, that's not right.

14

the 341 meeting that the trustee intended to sell it.

15

Her claim is that even -- even if he can get more value

16

than she said it was worth, she keeps all of that value,

17

regardless of what it's worth, because -- because her

18

schedule told us unequivocally that she got to keep it

19

regardless of its actual value.

20

Here the debtor was told at

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then -- then her claim is

21

wrong, her claim is objectionable, and the trustee

22

should have made an objection.

23

MR. GOLDBLATT:

But the best reading of her

24

schedule is not to make such a claim, but rather to read

25

her schedule to -- to mean what it says, which is that

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

she claimed to have a $10,718 exemption in the property,

2

and insofar as the property is worth more than that,

3

that that's -- that -- that is a question of valuation,

4

which isn't the subject of an obligation to raise an

5

objection.

6

Also, to the point of simplicity, Justice

7

Ginsburg, if I may, the -- the virtue of the rule

8

that we urge here is that -- that it does provide for

9

simplicity.

10

A debtor can clearly put the trustee on

notice.
The consequence of the debtor's rule would

11
12

be to require trustees, whenever schedules happen to use

13

the same number, to come in and file pro forma

14

objections.

15

reason as a matter of bankruptcy policy or statutory

16

construction to simply require more paperwork to get to

17

the same result.

18

And it doesn't seem that there is any

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Has that happened in the

19

two circuits that apply a rule similar to this, the

20

Sixth and the Third?

21

MR. GOLDBLATT:

What I understand, Justice

22

Sotomayor, is that that -- the answer to that is yes and

23

that in the Third Circuit following this decision that

24

trustees are filing those kinds of pro forma objections.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL

6

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

7

AS AMICUS CURIAE,

8

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. WALL:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The government is not saying that it's a

11
12

coincidence that these numbers in the third and fourth

13

columns are the same.

14

debtor will often estimate what she believes to be the

15

market value of her property and then divvy up a wild

16

card across items in hope -- hopes of keeping them.

17

It is a common practice.

A

The government's and Petitioner's only point

18

is that where a debtor does that, as Respondent did

19

here, she's still claiming the fixed exemption of what

20

she believes to be the market value.

21

Now, I take your concern, Justice Ginsburg,

22

this might be unfair to debtors who wouldn't be

23

tipped off.

24

came to the creditors’ meeting and said:

25

your exemption as limited, and I think the property is

That is not true here, where the trustee

worth about $7,000 more, and I intend to sell it.

2

And at that point, a debtor who really

3

believed that her schedule claimed full value would, it

4

seems to me, have said:

5

She didn't do that.

6

30-day period had run when the trustee moved to sell

7

the property.

8
9

You're misreading my schedule.

She didn't do that until after the

Now, she --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What she did do, she

That unsettles me so much that I'm going to

10

withdraw from this bankruptcy proceeding; beyond

11

anything, I want to keep that -- that property.
MR. WALL:

12

That's right.

But she -- but

13

she -- she did walk in.

She didn't say:

14

misreading my schedule.

She said:

15

sell the property if indeed it's worth more than the

16

exemption I've claimed, and so I want to dismiss my

17

bankruptcy.

18

Chapter 7.

19

The Bankruptcy Court found that she had not shown cause,

20

and the debtor didn't appeal that determination, which

21

is not before this Court.

I don't want you to

Which she doesn't have a right to do under
She has to show cause under section 707(a).

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22

You're

But the -- but the

23

Bankruptcy Court did that simultaneously with saying:

24

And I'm going to deny the trustee's motion to have an

25

auction.

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. WALL:

That's right.

And on remand, it

2

would certainly be open to her to attempt to convince

3

the Bankruptcy Court again that she had shown cause

4

under 707 to dismiss.

5

I think the government's point is that there

6

is a process for sale.

So even beyond the facts of this

7

case, when the trustee wants to sell property, he has to

8

give 20 days' notice to the debtors and the creditors

9

under section 363 of the code and Rule 2002.

So if the

10

trustee here had not even said anything at the

11

creditors’ meeting but had moved to sell, he would have

12

had to give notice to the debtor, who at that point

13

could always amend her schedules under Rule 1009.
If she had any exemption left to claim, she

14
15

could walk in and say:

16

and I'm going to increase my exemption, because I

17

underestimated the property value.

18

didn't and couldn't do that here is because she had

19

maxed out her wild card.

20

remand --

21
22

I'm going to amend my schedule,

The reason she

But it's -- indeed, even on

What she could have done

is trimmed some items from the list.
MR. WALL:

23

And she still could on remand.

24

Even on remand, she could walk in and amend her schedule

25

and say:

I'm going to itemize exactly the equipment

22
Alderson Reporting Company

1

that I want to keep with my wild card.

And I'm going to

2

say which of my kitchen equipment I want to keep with my

3

$10,225, and which I don't.

4

So, it's not that -- there's nothing about

5

Petitioner's approach that denies the debtor the fresh

6

start to which she is entitled under the code.

7

she can always claim right up to the legal limits.

the statute and the rules say is if you have an

That's all we're interested

MR. WALL:

Well, it says the list of

2

property claimed as exempt.

3

nearly the first 100 years after they set up the system

4

in 1898, on Schedule C and its predecessors the debtor

5

put down the location and present use of property.

6

no one thought that the location was part of the claim

7

of exemption, such that if the trustee believed the

8

property was in one place than another, he had to

9

object.

10

So, for instance, for

But

The idea was we'll provide some useful

11

information to the trustee beyond the claim of

12

exemption, so that if he wants to file a turnover

13

complaint to get the property into the estate, he knows

14

where it's located.

15

But it just isn't true, as a historical or

16

logical matter, that everything that shows up on

17

Schedule C is part of the claimed exemption.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is it also true –-

19

tell me about this:

One of my concerns is that the

20

trustees simply don't have time in every case to have a

21

creditors’ meeting and go through every asset.

22

If they did, then Justice Breyer's

23

suggestion, where they'd sit down and talk about all

24

this stuff, would be -- would be fine.

25

wrong in making that empirical assumption?

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Am I right or
I mean, I

1

just don't know.

2

MR. WALL:

I think that's entirely fair.

3

They do have to have a creditors’ meeting, so they do

4

have to -- you know, within 20 to 40 days of the filing

5

of the petition.

6

Respondent's approach as a practical matter is the world

7

will look no different; it will just have a lot more

8

litigation.

9

But I think what will happen on

Whenever the numbers in columns 3 and 4

10

match up, the trustee will file a pro forma objection or

11

extension request.

is at risk that it might be worth $400,000 or whatever.
MR. WALL:

Exactly.

And I think the reason

17

that it's odd to set up that kind of presumption is

18

because you're basically presuming that the debtor is

19

acting to claim an exemption in kind to which he is not

20

entitled under the code.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

down if she thinks this is what the property is worth,

MR. WALL:

Well, the debtor would do

exactly what she did here, and if the trustee went to

come in and amend her schedules and say --

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

through -- I think as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, you

have to go through a long process if you're going to

seems like a waste of money and time.

10

MR. WALL:

Well, if the debtor actually

11

wanted to claim, say, full value or 100 percent of value

12

-- there are debtors that commonly do that.

faith, depending on the rule we -- we adopt, but she

else, do you think this is worth more than she's

that particular asset, an unliquidated lawsuit.

When

2

we're talking about tangible property such as cooking

equipment, where you can figure out -- you look at the

pot and you have an idea of what it's worth, you are

5

required to state that amount.

6

Now, I think, Justice Kennedy, a good rule

7

of decision is -- or a good principle of decision here

8

is that the exemptions are part of the fresh start in

9

bankruptcy, and we construe exceptions to that fresh

10

start against creditors, against the trustee.
JUSTICE BREYER:

11

Do you have any sense of

12

how it works in practice?

13

Justice Kennedy's question, because the government says

14

in practice what's been happening is that in most

15

places, trustees don't -- they don't object to these

16

kinds of valuations problems, and now suddenly when the

17

rule has changed in some circuit, they do object as a

matter of form, which is unnecessary paperwork.

I'm a little worried by

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Justice Breyer, under the

rules, the trustee has the burden of objecting if the

2

trustee has any basis for objection, including

3

valuation, and -- but the trustee has to have a good

4

faith reason for objecting, and how that is determined

5

is the trustee looks at the schedules, asks questions at

6

the meeting of creditors, a section 341 meeting, and

then if the trustee has any objection at all, present

it.

Now, under your rule,

11

the trustee has 30 days to get this good faith basis.

12

Does that mean that he or she has to get a valuation on

everything that's listed at full value, that that is

14

really the burden we're talking about?
It's not the burden of filing a piece of

paper that says I want an a exemption, or even one that

says I have an objection.

that objection and how much effort goes to that

If someone's claiming only the exempt amount, then I'll

whether the valuation is right or not, but I won't

Your rule would require something else.

objection.
MR. BRUNSTAD:

But they’d have to do

22

MR. BRUNSTAD:

In a situation where the

debtor claims the property as exempt, yes, and here's

24

why, Justice Kennedy:

25

Because the trustee again can --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If -- if he claims the

2

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Well, if the debtor claims

3

the whole property is exempt, then it's not property of

4

the estate unless the trustee interposes a timely and

5

successful objection, because section 362 of the

6

Bankruptcy Code, which authorizes sales, only

7

specifically authorizes sales of property of the estate;

8

and if someone claims property as exempt, if no

objection is interposed under 522(l), then the property

claimed as -- is exempt.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

11

My question was –- I

thought I understood your remark to say anytime there’s

13

a sale, there has to be a valuation or an appraisal

14

before the sale.
MR. BRUNSTAD:

If, in fact, the debtor

16

claims the property as exempt, that's correct.

the debtor concedes, the trustee can sell it.

fact that it’s -- that there's going to be a sale may

23

indicate that your premise is not true most of the time.
MR. BRUNSTAD:

24
25

here's why:

No, Justice Kennedy, and

because the statute, for example, points

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that the court is going to determine in the first

2

instance whether the objection claim is valid, if there

3

is in fact an objection.

4

section 522(a) says value is determined as of the date

5

the debtor files for bankruptcy.

6

How do we know this?

Because

We do not have sales to determine whether,

7

in fact, the property is what it's worth.

We determine

8

whether the -- that the claim of exemption is valid.

9

First, there's a judicial determination of value.

It's

10

geared towards the date of the petition date.

11

Because Congress understood that debtors want this

12

property, not just a check from the trustee.

13

and parcel of their fresh start.

14

explained in Rousey and in Owen, that the fresh start

15

policy embraces the exemption.

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Yes.

The facts of this case

are exactly that, Justice Ginsburg.

In the ordinary situation, it will happen a

And so it appears to me that most of the courts are

saying to us:

It depends on the circumstances.

We don't want a default rule, because we

have to see what has happened and see what has happened

2

between the parties to determine in one situation rather

3

than another what the intent was.

4

It's not an irrational rule.

Why shouldn't

5

we be considering that as an alternative?

Because once

6

we make an announcement like the one that you're

7

proposing, it is an inducement to undervalue your

8

property, for a debtor, because -- in the hopes that an

9

overly worked trustee won't have either the time or

10

opportunity or wherewithal to understand that the value

11

is off and that they're going to lose something that the

12

estate is entitled to.

13

MR. BRUNSTAD:

I can see that, Justice

14

Sotomayor, but I think that here are much worse

15

incentives with the trustee's rule, and much worse

16

problems, much greater harm to the statutory scheme.

17

Now, Your Honor's question about these court

comparable circuit court opinions and situations very

analogous to this one, where the circuit courts have

during the process.

17

And if the debtor has not made it clear that

18

they're seeking the full value of the property, as

19

happened here, there was a conversation that the value

20

was off, the debtor did not tell the trustee that she

21

was claiming the full amount of the property.

It basically says to the trustee, you

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No.

What it says is, if

8

you're engaged in good faith negotiation over a value or

9

over the claimed exemption, you should -- both sides

10

should be open about it.
MR. BRUNSTAD:

11

Yes, but, Justice Sotomayor,

12

it is the filing of the objection that triggers the

13

negotiation, and this is key.

14

quite key because the practice is that, if the trustee

15

exempts to the -- exempts -- sorry -- objects to the

16

valuation, then there is a court hearing, and the court

17

will resolve the objection if the parties can't

18

negotiate it afterwards.

19

And if you look --

2

MR. BRUNSTAD:

But if there is no objection,

3

then is no involvement of the court, and the

4

conversation stops.

5

objection is because the trustee has the burden of

6

coming forward and demonstrating that the debtor's

7

valuation is wrong.

8

the trustee is now saying, oh, I just need to sell, I

9

don't have to object, the trustee is evading his burden

11

And the reason why you have the

of proof.
By just simply saying, I'm authorized to

12

sell, I am going to sell, as long as it is not the

13

debtor who doesn't object.

14

inverts the burden of proof.

15

The trustee's proposal

It's now under the trustee's proposal, when

16

the trustee files a motion to sell, the debtor has to

17

come forward and object and now say, wait, I have a

18

valuable exemption here.

19

What -- what the trustee then has done is

20

simply said, I don't have to comply with my burden of

21

proof that's set by the rule and the statute.

22

all, section 522(l) puts the burden on the trustee, as

23

well, to object.

that -- we need that finality.

And, again, we need

The trustee would basically have, under his

3
4

proposal, an ability to file a motion to sell a year

5

later, 2 years later, 4 years later, by reopening a

6

case that's been closed, if the trustee thought that.

7

Our whole point about finality, which was a

8

key principle animating the decision below and also this

9

Court's decision in Taylor, where the Court made the

10

observation that, although these deadlines may yield, in

11

some situations, unwelcome results, they serve very

12

important finality interests.

13
14

The debtor needs to know, is this my
property?

Can I use it?
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

But this debtor did know

16

at the creditors’ meeting -- she certainly knew that the

17

trustee was claiming the property was worth more than

18

what she listed it as being worth.

19

She could have, at that point -- so she had

20

the notice of what he was thinking.

21

that point, said, I will remove as many items as

22

necessary to bring me safely within the limit.

23

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Ginsburg.

She could have, at

Instead she said, this -- the trustee wants

motion to sell all of it.

He's filing -- he filed a

The trustee did not give her an opportunity

3
4

to do that allocation, which she would have had if the

5

trustee had filed an objection.

6

In responding to the objection, she could

7

have said, well, I'm only going to allocate something,

8

because the objection would have been under the

9

exemption rules; whereas, the trustee, when the trustee

10

filed the motion to sell, it was under 363, which is the

11

motion to sell rules, where the debtor would then have

12

had to come forward and object to the motion for some

13

reason, but, again, you don't have that allocation

14

option under section 363.
And, again, the trustee puts the cart before

15
16

the horse.

17

is property of the estate, and under section 522, if, in

18

fact, the debtor claims property as exempt, if there is

19

no exemption -- no objection, it is exempt, and,

20

therefore, it's not property of the estate.

21

means exempt from property of the estate.

22

cannot sell.

23

The trustee cannot sell property, unless it

“Exempt”
A trustee

Congress set up this regime purposefully, to

24

have judicial determinations of exemptions right away,

25

and that, again, is triggered by an objection being

Alderson Reporting Company

1

filed.

That way, we know, at the beginning of the case,

2

does the debtor have the property?

3

she continue?

4

Or is this something the trustee is going to be able to

5

sell?

6

Can she use it?

Can

Third parties -- can they rely on that?

Now, it's important also because the

7

practice, in bankruptcy, as reflected in the Collier

8

forms, is that the bankruptcy court can make a judicial

9

determination.

Say, for example, the bankruptcy court

10

here had said:

I think there is some merit to the

11

trustee's objection; the property is worth $12,000.

12

The practice, as reflected in the sample form, is for

13

the court then to say to the debtor:

14

want to keep this property, give the trustee a check for

15

the difference between what you're entitled to claim and

16

what I'm establishing the value to be.

17

Debtor, if you

18

exemption is filed, and we're under section 522

21

That can't happen if we're under section

So, again, the trustee's rule eliminates

22

that established practice and that established option in

23

favor of the debtor.

24

25

rules, under Rule 1009, to reallocate her -- her

2

sacrificed some other area or something and taken --

3

taken her additional exemption availability somewhere

4

and applied it.

5

All those options are foreclosed, where the

6

trustee doesn't file an objection and the trustee moves

7

to sell instead.

there are no further questions?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG G. GOLDBLATT

14

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

15

MR. GOLDBLATT:

16

Thank you.

I have two

17

points, one practical and one about what the forms here

18

mean.

19

liquidating and selling the -- the assets of the

20

estates is the work that is done throughout

21

bankruptcy case.

First, as a practical matter, the task of

22

Mr. Brunstad's suggestion that,

23

historically, that there was -- the deadline applied to

24

the work of liquidating the estate is simply incorrect.

25

And, in response to Justice Breyer's

58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

question, you asked, where do I turn to find out how

2

hard it is to simply extend the deadline?

3

that question, with respect to the 341 meeting, is page

4

7-7 of the U.S. Trustees’ Manual, which says, quite

5

clearly, that such extensions should be granted only

6

under exceptional circumstances, and the trustee should

7

not continue the 341 meeting when the debtor appears at

8

that meeting.

9

The answer to

So that we have a real practical problem

10

of basically undermining Congress's judgment about

11

giving the trustee adequate time to liquidate the assets

12

for the benefit of creditors.

13

With respect to what these schedules mean

14

and whether the debtor was claiming an in-kind

15

exemption, Chief Justice Roberts, you had it right when

16

you said -- you know, when the debtor files what the

17

value of the property is worth is unclear, the debtor

18

doesn't know, when they file, what this will obtain at

19

auction.

20

The debtor is giving an estimate.

The

21

question is whether one should read these forms to say,

22

if it turns out that my estimate is wrong, I want that

23

anyway, or if the -- or if you should read these forms

24

to say, if it turns out that my estimate is wrong, all I

25

want is what Congress gave me.

59
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And we think that one shouldn't lightly

2

impute to the debtor a claim to be making an improper

3

and unlawful claim to keep the thing itself, when

4

Congress quite clearly gave the debtor a monetary

5

interest.

6

And, finally, with respect to the question

7

of allocation, the debtor can, at any time, Justice

8

Ginsburg, reallocate, including after the motion to

9

sell, their schedules.

10

a matter of course.

Rule 1009 says you can amend as

So there is still the opportunity to

11

give the debtor exactly what Congress intended.
