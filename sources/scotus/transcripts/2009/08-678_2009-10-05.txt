Mr. Allen.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RANDALL L. ALLEN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. ALLEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

For well over a century this Court has

12

recognized the importance of the attorney-client

13

privilege.

14

clearly states that the seal of secrecy upon

15

communications between client and attorney is founded

16

upon the necessity, in the interest of justice, that the

17

aid and advice of persons having knowledge and skill in

18

the practice of law provide that advice in a manner that

19

is safely and readily available and, importantly, free

20

from the consequences or apprehension of disclosure.

21

In Hunt v. Blackburn in 1888, the Court

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Allen, except for the

22

fact that you and I are lawyers, do you really think

23

that the -- that confidentiality right is any more

24

important to the proper functioning of society than,

25

let's say, the protection of trade secrets?
3
Alderson Reporting Company

So that in

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

a case of discovery where the defendant says, if I

2

produce this I would be giving up a trade secret and

3

it's not necessary for the case, and the judge says no,

4

turn it over -- would there be in your view a right to

5

interlocutory appeal in that case?

6

then why here?

7

MR. ALLEN:

And if not there,

Justice Scalia, there are -

8

there are several answers to the question.

9

start, first, with the -- the issue of the importance of

10

-- of the attorney-client privilege as a key and central

11

element of the administration of justice that this Court

12

has recognized, not just with Hunt, but in a number of

13

cases since.

14

Let me

But the question I think also goes more to

15

prong three of Cohen, which is the reviewability

16

standard.

17

information, once that information is disclosed to your

18

adversary, it is disclosed to the last person on earth

19

you might want to see it.

20

In the context of attorney-client privileged

It is a suit between another company who is a

23

MR. ALLEN:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

The same thing with a trade

Well And the Judge says, turn

over your trade secret, the formula for Cocoa-Cola, and
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you say no.

No interlocutory appeal, right?

2

MR. ALLEN:

I think with trade secrets -

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Or do you say there should

4

be an interlocutory appeal there?

5

MR. ALLEN:

Your Honor, we do not argue

6

that -- here, that there should be an interlocutory

7

appeal for trade secrets.

8

resolution to the trade secret question is present in

9

most cases of commercial litigation, where the court

I think the practical

10

would provide a protective order limiting access to the

11

trade secret; in other words, limiting access to

12

counsel.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But what if the court

14

doesn't, as Justice Scalia has posited?

15

could do the same thing, depending on the secret being

16

disclosed.

17

mechanisms.

18

The court here

It could set up any number of protective

The issue is broader than that, which is:

19

Why is the public policy of anti-disclosure any more

20

important in the attorney-client privilege than in the

21

trade secret context?

22

MR. ALLEN:

Yes, Justice Sotomayor.

But,

23

with regard to the attorney-client privilege, first on

24

the issue of the protective order, the protective order

25

cannot limit the adversary's counsel from seeing the
5

2

information.
As I said earlier, I think that's the last

3

person in the world you would want to see.

4

limit access to trade secrets to counsel, who could make

5

no use of the Coca-Cola formula or -- or Colonel

6

Sanders' chicken recipe, but -- but the -

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

MR. ALLEN:

Ah.

You could

Are you sure?

But -- but the answer to the -

9

the importance question, I think, has to return to the

10

central and important role that the privilege plays in

11

the administration of justice.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But isn't the role -

13

the central role -- role, is to encourage the frank and

14

open communication between client and attorney?

15

the purpose of the rule, isn't it?

16

MR. ALLEN:

17
18

That's

It -- it is the purpose of the

rule, at least in part, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

If that is

19

the purpose, the very existence of exceptions infringes

20

that purpose.

21

are placing some sort of limitation to the frank and

22

open discussion that you are permitting, so the damage

23

is already done.

25

The minute you create an exception, you

the purpose -- or help the purpose in any meaningful

way.

2

attorney-client disclosure is not going to stop people

3

from talking to lawyers if they really need to and they

4

are staying within the rules.

5

The fact that an erroneous decision on

MR. ALLEN:

Your Honor, I --

don't think we

6

are here to suggest that it would stop people from

7

talking to their lawyers.

8

incremental erosion of the rule is going to lessen the

9

value of the privilege.

10

I think the point is that the

At this -

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well -- but that's what

11

I'm trying to figure out, because you are positing that

12

erroneous decisions on disclosures are being made

13

routinely by the lower courts.

14

Assuming, as I do, that there are some

15

erroneous disclosures, but that that's not necessarily

16

the majority, why is there an incremental erosion

17

significant enough to overcome our interests in the

18

finality rule?

19

MR. ALLEN:

Your Honor, I don't think we

20

suggest that -- that erroneous orders on privilege are

21

occurring routinely.

22

occurred in this case and that they happened in other

23

cases.

24
25

Certainly, we have suggested they

But I think the more direct answer to your
question goes to the Court's holding in Upjohn.
7
Alderson Reporting Company

One of

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the things that Upjohn points out is that what is

2

necessary -- and I think the Court makes a similar

3

observation in Swidler & Berlin, that one of the things

4

that's necessary for the privilege to have effect is

5

predictability.

6

If -- if there is no predictability, then

7

you fall back to the apprehension or the worry of

8

disclosure that is observed in Hunt.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

10

predictability.

11

there is already that limitation.

12

Maybe it can be waived.

13

Let's talk about

Once you make an exception for waiver,
It's not absolute.

Secondly, you have to worry about a district

14

court finding it to have been waived, even though it

15

really wasn't.

That's another point of doubt.

16

And, thirdly, you have to worry about the

17

Supreme Court affirming a district court that wrongly

18

found it to have been waived because we give, you know,

19

weight to the fact-finding of the -- of the district

20

court.

21

Once you -- once you factor in all of those

22

uncertainties, you are not talking about a -- you know,

23

about a fail-safe privilege at all.

24

doubts, and I'm not sure the doubts are increased

25

enormously, by simply saying a district court may make a
8
Alderson Reporting Company

There are those

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

mistake without -- without your being able to go up to

2

the court of appeals on that mistake.

3

MR. ALLEN:

Your Honor, I don't disagree

4

that -- that the rule we search for will not still have

5

problems with the protection of the attorney-client

6

privilege, but I do disagree that it will not

7

significantly improve the quality of the rules that

8

counsel are -- are designed -- or counsel are -- are

9

instructed to follow.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Allen, you used a

11

term before, and I think you were right in using it -

12

you said, "interlocutory review," but

13

Cohen v. Beneficial is a narrow exception and it -- the

14

theory is, it is a final judgment.

15

interlocutory.

16

It's not

And, nowadays, the courts have 1292(b).

17

They can certify a question, if they think it's

18

sufficiently important and they need an answer, without

19

pretending that it's a final judgment in the case.

20

So, given 1292(b), shouldn't we be

21

particularly reluctant to extend Cohen v. Beneficial to

22

include a case of a privilege that maybe was wrongfully

23

denied?

24
25

MR. ALLEN:
believe that you do.

No, Justice Ginsburg.

I don't

I used the term "interlocutory"
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

only to refer to the fact that the appeal would take

2

place while the case-in-chief proceeds.

3
4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that's what 1292(b)

was meant to deal with.

5

MR. ALLEN:

I don't think 1292 would -

6

would obtain, in this instance, and I think the -- the

7

judge in the district court made this observation

8

himself, although he did not expound on his reasoning.

9

It would appear that the reasoning would be

10

that this -- that a decision in this case is not likely

11

to materially advance the ultimate determination of the

12

litigation, so, therefore, I think 1292(b) would not be

13

applicable in the ordinary case to a -- to a ruling

14

finding waiver of the attorney-client privilege.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why do you think that

16

your -- that this privilege -- or is it -- more

17

important than any other privilege?

18

Scalia's question and your answer convinced me that you

19

can protect this the same as you can any other trade

20

secret -- any trade secret.

21

I mean, Justice

Of course, you do disclose it to the

22

opposing party, but that is also true of any breach of

23

any privilege, so husband-wife, priest-penitent,

24

psychiatrist and patient.

25

privileged.

I take all of those are

Do we allow collateral appeals there?
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. ALLEN:

No, Your Honor, you have not.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, if we don't allow

3

collateral appeals with the husband and wife, with the

4

priest and -- and someone in -- you know, confession or

5

something, I don't -- with a priest, or with a

6

psychiatrist who is dealing with a patient, why would we

7

allow collateral appeal here?

8
9
10
11

MR. ALLEN:

Your Honor, first of all, I

don't think the issue of those other privileges has, to
the best of my knowledge, come before this Court.
JUSTICE BREYER:

But then if we grant your

12

collateral appeal, don't we have to, perhaps, equally

13

grant it in every situation, where a judge arguably

14

makes an erroneous ruling on a question of privilege?

15

MR. ALLEN:

I don't believe you do, Your

16

Honor, and let me say, first of all, the -- the instance

17

that Your Honor points to, where the information would

18

be disclosed to the other party, it's not the other

19

party in this instance, that -

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. ALLEN:

It's the lawyer.

-- that you are worried about in

22

first instance.

It is, in fact, the counsel.

23

and, second of all, I think the importance criteria

24

as -- as previously defined in this Court's cases, is a

25

measure of the importance of the interest that will be
11
Alderson Reporting Company

And -

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

lost if appeal is not available now.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

So it's -- in your opinion,

3

it's more important to protect the lawyers, who talk to

4

clients, from erroneous rulings, than protect the priest

5

or protect the wife or husband or protect the

6

psychiatrist who is dealing with a patient?

7

Now, that's hard for me to see why.

I mean,

8

I think lawyers are very important, but it's a little

9

hard to see why they are more important than these other

10
11
12
13

people.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What is the use --

I'm -- I'm sorry if I cut you off.
But what is the use by the adversary lawyer

14

that you are worried about?

That the lawyer is going to

15

used information against your client, correct?

16

MR. ALLEN:

Correct, Your Honor.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So there is a remedy.

18

After final judgment, if the information was disclosed

19

erroneously, the court sets aside the judgment, sends it

20

back, and says, you can't use it in the future and so

21

make your case without it.

22

MR. ALLEN:

Your Honor, that -- I apologize.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why isn't that an

24

effective remedy for the harm that you are claiming

25

exists in the disclosure?
12
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. ALLEN:

That is the analysis that the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You have to a right to

12

don't permit that to be interlocutorily appealed.

13

MR. ALLEN:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15
16

That's Why is this any greater

in terms of the harm that your client suffers?
MR. ALLEN:

That is correct, Your Honor, but

17

in the attorney-client privilege cases, this Court did

18

not find that collateral order jurisdiction did not

19

obtain because of the fact that the attorney-client

20

privilege or the attorney-client -- excuse me -

21

disqualification cases were not important.

22

ruling was premised upon the fact that that order was

23

sufficiently reviewable under prong three of Cohen.

24

it's not -- the decisions were not based on Cohen -

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The Court's

I understand what the

13
Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

court below did.

2

about the importance of this privilege and why it's

3

critical that it be subject to interlocutory appeal as

4

opposed to the final judgment ruling.

5

I'm just following up on your point

MR. ALLEN:

Justice Sotomayor, the -- the

6

importance in this instance is -- is measured against

7

the societal importance or the societal need for

8

non-piecemeal application of the final judgment rule.

9

So when you measure the attorney-client privilege and

10

the role that it plays in the administration of justice

11

in ensuring observance with laws against a rule of

12

efficiency, in this instance in our view, the

13

attorney-client privilege weighs heavier in that

14

consideration.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's not -- it's not a

16

rule of efficiency.

17

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

Otherwise, once you get into -- once it's a fact-bound

3

question, you are really eroding the final judgment

4

rule.

5

MR. ALLEN:

I understand your question,

6

Justice Ginsburg.

7

that the Court would need to consider are sufficiently

8

narrow that it should not trouble the final judgment

9

rule and sufficiently collateral -

10

I think in this instance, the facts

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you are carving out

11

an area, attorney-client privilege, as opposed to the

12

kind of situation Cohen v. Beneficial dealt with.

13

Here's a rule that a State has.

14

security for costs before you go ahead with a class

15

action.

16

18

for costs.

19

You have to put up

The answer to that is either yes or no, that it

You just have a class action, you need security

Maybe this particular case doesn't involve

20

many facts, but there will be attorney-client privileges

21

cases, waiver cases that surely do.

22

that category, attorney-client privilege, and equate it

23

to what was the kind of question at issue in Cohen.

24
25

MR. ALLEN:

So we can't take

I agree, Justice Ginsburg that

that was the kind of narrow issue that was at issue
15
Alderson Reporting Company

in -- in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial.

2

has considered much more factually intensive cases in

3

the context of qualified immunity or maybe as a better

4

example, the context of the double jeopardy claim such

5

as in Abney.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But this Court

Because those are cases

7

that say your right is not to be tried, your right is

8

not to be exposed to trial at all.

9

MR. ALLEN:

That is correct, Your Honor.

My

10

only point is that the appellate courts are perfectly

11

capable and able to consider the facts that are at issue

12

in those cases, and it does not unduly burden the

13

appellate process in the context of those type of cases.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask two yes or no

15

questions?

One, did you, in fact, ask for a 1292(b)

16

right to appeal, make an interlocutory appeal?

17

MR. ALLEN:

No, Your Honor, we did not.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And the second question

19

is, would your rule apply if the decision had gone the

20

other way?

21

would the other -- would the person seeking discovery

22

have the same right to appeal that you asked for here?

23

If they had denied access to the documents,

MR. ALLEN:

No, Your Honor, the -- the party

24

losing the claim would not have the same right to

25

appeal.
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE STEVENS:

2

MR. ALLEN:

Why not?

I think access to information in

3

the course of discovery does not trigger the same

4

important interest that orders compelling discovery of

5

attorney-client would trigger?

6

they would in any way satisfy that test.

7

in fact, the question presented as designed even by

8

Respondent does not capture orders that deny the

9

disclosure of attorney-client privilege information.

10

So I don't think that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And I think,

Some time ago

11

Justice Breyer asked the question of why is this

12

different than the other privileges, and I would like

13

your answer to that.

14

MR. ALLEN:

Justice Breyer, I think that the

15

answer to that question has to focus on the role that

16

the privilege plays in the administration of justice,

17

and it's why I went, in response to Justice Sotomayor's

18

question, why I went to the balancing between the

19

interest of the attorney-client privilege versus the

20

interest of a more rigorous application of the final

21

judgment rule.

22

So -- so, while I think it is instructive to

23

compare the privilege to other privileges that the Court

24

may in the future confront, I think the proper analysis

25

is to balance that, that rigorous application of the
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

final judgment rule, to the attorney-client privilege.

2

And I think in that instance it resolves more quickly.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Allen, one of the

4

purposes, one of the -- the underpinnings of

5

Cohen v. Beneficial is that this kind of question is not

6

going to come up very often, but attorney-client

7

privilege, once you say that that's open to -

8

everything stops while you go to the court of appeals to

9

get that.

And if you -- and if we hold the way you want

10

us to, then a lawyer will be obligated every time she

11

thinks that she has a valid claim to the privilege or

12

that it hasn't been waived, she would be obligated to

13

take an appeal which you are urging would be an appeal

14

of right.

15

MR. ALLEN:

Justice Ginsburg, I don't

16

believe that the attorney would be obligated to take the

17

appeal.

18

we've laid out in our brief with regard to what has

19

actually occurred -- we wonder how many appeals might

20

take place.

21

because we have the experience in the Third and the

22

Ninth and the D.C. Circuits that tell us that in the

23

11 years since Ford was decided by Judge Becker in the

24

Third Circuit, the opinion by Judge Becker in the Third

25

Circuit, that there have been only 11 such cases brought

And I believe that the -- that the facts that

We know how many appeals might take place,

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

up on appeal.

So, we have some experience to tell us

2

what will actually happen.

3

But I don't believe it requires that the

4

attorney as a matter of obligation take that appeal.

5

The Court, I believe, dealt with this same issue in the

6

Behrens v. Pelletier case, which is a qualified immunity

7

case, where the Court wondered whether or not there were

8

going to be an increase, a significant increase in

9

the -- the appeals that arose out of -- out of the

10

Court's holding.

11

conclusion that could be reached -- and I believe the

Easterbrook in the Able case in the Seventh Circuit -

that the only conclusion that could be drawn is that

there was forebearance by the lawyers in taking appeals

16

that they otherwise had the opportunity to take.

think there is no reason to conclude that there would be

waiver, crime or fraud, scope of the privilege,

because the public interest is the same in all cases

wanting us to limit this rule only to the waiver cases?

Correct, Your Honor.

We have

question presented having to do with only waiver cases.

Your Honor Otherwise, how do we

distinguish or make a difference in your analysis?

10

MR. ALLEN:

I think it's certainly -- it

11

certainly should be assumed that if this Court rules in

12

our favor, it must conclude that the attorney-client

13

privilege is important.

14

If it concludes that the -

16

outweighs the finality rule.

17

thing for you.

18

No one is doubting its

The issue is whether or that importance

MR. ALLEN:

That's a very different

I -- I agree.

But -- but in

19

order to get to -- to the position we advocate, the

20

Court must pass that threshold and establish importance.

21

If the Court reaches that conclusion it is certainly

22

likely that the importance test in other existence-of

23

privilege cases, for example, would obtain.

24
25

I -- I don't think that compels the
conclusion that any case addressing privilege must

therefore be permitted collateral order jurisdiction.

2

For example, I believe you recited the crime fraud

3

exception in your question.

4

exception might present a difficulty with prong two of

5

the Cohen analysis, which has to do with the

6

separability of the issue on appeal for merit.

7

may well be that in crime fraud cases there is not

8

sufficient separability of the issue from the merits and

9

therefore collateral order jurisdiction would not

10

Certainly crime fraud

So it

obtain.

11

As I mentioned earlier, I think we are in

12

agreement that orders that deny the disclosure of

13

information would not be immediately appealable.

14

there are -- there are a number of instances that this

15

Court might find in what I'll call general privilege

16

cases that might not obtain, and it's the course that

17

the Court has taken in other sort of general areas of

18

law.

19

cases, the Court started off in Firestone finding that

20

orders denying disqualification did not satisfy

21

collateral order jurisdiction and it limited its

22

holdings to -- to that instance.

23

So

For example, in the attorney disqualification

of those cases.

5

So the Court has

We suggest that approach in this case.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there any sensible

line between an invocation of the privilege, denied, and

7

a holding that the privilege has been waived?

8

your reply brief you -- you draw some kind of a

9

distinction between waiver of the privilege and the

10

existence of the privilege.

11

MR. ALLEN:

I know in

I didn't follow it.

Other than the examples that I

12

--- that I just gave, Your Honor, I don't think there is

13

a principled difference between the finding of

14

importance, and that is -- that is clearly a threshold

15

issue.

16

the issues ultimately boil down to.

17

As Court said in Will, it's the -- the -- what

So with regard to that issue I -- I agree,

18

but with regard to crime fraud exception or instances

19

when no disclosure is ordered, another example that I

20

think the Respondent points to in their brief is

21

instances of inadvertent disclosure.

22

inadvertent disclosure would not trigger the -- the

prejudice element necessary because the -- if you will,

the cat is in fact already out of the bag at that point.

Mr. Chief Justice,

may it please the Court:
Before 1997, no circuit held that there was

appeal as of right for privilege or waiver, and most of

2

the circuits continue that approach.

approach because attorney-client privilege cases do not

fit the parameters of the Cohen appealability and there

5

are alternative responses that are available on the

6

remedial side.

7

factor of importance which has just been discussed here,

8

this Court has over the 60 years of some 30 opinions

9

refined the importance test and moved it away from the

That is the right

In terms of the Cohen factors, the

10

questions of place, shape of litigation, dynamics of

11

litigation, to a very narrow set of cases in which a

12

government is typically a party or a government

13

official, and there is a very significant either

14

constitutional or statutory question principally of

15

immunity from suit.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will get to that,

17

I think, when the government lawyer gets up.

18

that distinction make sense to you?

19

MS. RESNIK:

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21
22

But does

I think the Government lawyers

get the privilege, private lawyers don't?
MS. RESNIK:

As I understand the

23

government's position here, it's that ordinary lawyers

24

don't get the privilege in ordinary litigation.

government is here to speak to the question of State

3

it's important that we understand from the presence of

4

them that this is a rule that is appropriate for lawyers

5

on all sides of the fence, because the immediate

6

availability of appeal as a right stops in the tracks.

7

The case was decided at the district court in October of

2007 and, holding aside these proceedings, it was August

9

of 2008 when the Eleventh Circuit rejected the mandamus

And I think

and the appeal.
So the wisdom of the final judgment rule is

12

precisely because the cost and delay, particularly in

13

the area of discovery and evidentiary privileges, is so

14

significant given that there are so many of these.

15

one of the important -

adversary system which we've determined to be central to

maintaining the rule of law.

20

privileges, priest-penitent, other evidentiary

21

privileges, because it is the privilege that allows

22

lawyers to protect the interests in those other cases.

23

And it just seems to me that -- that to allow a single

24

ruling by a district court judge to undermine the

25

privilege is going to affect people.

This is not like the other

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

What -- I mean, the statement of the lawyer

2

could be, look, you are going to lose this case, and you

3

are saying the district court can require the disclosure

4

of that without allowing at least a quick trip to the

5

court of appeals to check it out.

6

MS. RESNIK:

Well, there are remedies -

7

there are two directions for an answer.

One is that in

8

all the courts of appeal of the three circuits that have

9

this rule, work product as well as attorney-client

10

privilege is available on appeal in the Third Circuit.

11

Trade secrets is available, although the Third Circuit

12

has raised questions given Will v. Hallock and

13

Cunningham about whether or not this remains a viable

14

position, but trade secrets is available.

15

Psychotherapists is appealable, spouse is appealable,

16

and nontestifying experts as well.

17
18
19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Which is the -

That is in the Third

Circuit.
MS. RESNIK:

Well, the Third, the Ninth and

20

the D.C. together are the three that have opened up the

21

door, and they have found -- the experience of those

22

appellate judges has not found that it is easy to make

23

the distinction among these, and as a consequence there

24

is appeal as of right to this entire cluster of cases.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Allen has told us

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that there are very few cases, in fact 11 cases in I

2

don't know how many years, in the Third Circuit.

3

MS. RESNIK:

Well, I take to be -- the

4

cheerful news is that by and large everyone is getting

5

it right at the trial level.

6

question -- first of all, one question would be how to

7

count the cases of whether there's these other appeals

8

as well.

9

But we are looking at the

But more importantly, both the law professor

10

and judge amici in our brief asked to look at the

11

pipeline, and there are two levels of the pipeline, or

12

three.

13

look at the numbers of instances when trial judges write

14

opinions, magistrate and district judges, which is only

15

the tip of that iceberg.

16

One is that in the district courts we try to

As best we can tell, somewhere between 10

17

and 30 times a month in Westlaw reports one can find a

18

conclusion either upholding or denying disclosure.

19

Moreover it's sequential -

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

which they do, right?

22

the statistics don't mean much.

23

MS. RESNIK:

Well, it matters

If they are denying disclosure

We found about half the cases,

24

and the law professors amici and judges amici found

25

about 104, in which in which disclosure was required, in
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

the six-month period.

2

at the trial level that exists in terms of the pipeline.

3

If we go just to the case that is before you, the

4

Federal district judge reserved question on a second

5

attorney-client privilege question because issuing a

6

protective order on the deposition, there is a related

7

case here and he precluded the lawyers from

8

participating in it.

9

So there is a significant number

JUSTICE ALITO:

I was on the Third Circuit

10

for eight years under this regime.

11

to me that the sky was falling.

12

remember any cases, any appeals involving this issue,

13

and we had lots of cases of a variety of kinds.

14

maybe there's -- I don't want to be a witness in this,

15

but you know, convince me that the sky really will fall

16

if we were to adopt this.

17

MS. RESNIK:

And it didn't seem

In fact I can't

So

I am not going to convince you

18

that the sky is going to fall, but I am going to suggest

19

that the Cohen rule does not apply to these cases not

20

only because the sky isn't going to fall.

21

question is there will be more cases for sure and there

22

will be more people with comparable privileges knocking

23

at the appellate doors, and they'll be sorting, so that

24

goes to the county.

25

and you said no to as well as the cases you said yes to.

The empirical

Do we count the cases that knocked

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

The other case is that the Cohen rule

2

requires a particular kind of importance and a

3

particular kind of severability.

4

trial judge said, in fairness, there has been a waiver

5

because you've injected new issues in the case.

6

order to get to the in fairness waiver injection, you

7

have to know the facts of the case and weigh the waiver

8

against the other facts in the case.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

In this case, the

In

So the Eleventh Circuit was

10

wrong on that issue?

Didn't they hold that this was -

11

this was separate from the merits?

12

MS. RESNIK:

In our view, every one of

13

the -- this case fails the test on all four -- three to

14

four of the Cohen prongs, which is separability and

15

conclusiveness or -- or distinct ideas, potentially,

16

importance, and remediability.

17

embeddedness here is typical of cases, CrimeStar was an

predicates are here.

5

Therefore, in this very case, if the rule were

Ms. Resnick, can you go

14

including in the Cohen case.

15

Because it's not just freedom from

MS. RESNIK:

We

Well, Cohen involved the major

question of the application of the Erie principle in

17

1949 involving a state -- the right of security for

18

expenses.

19

20

litigant, during the pendency of the case, going to be

economically secure or free, or drugged or not drugged,

as distinct qualities which are all framed in either

State law or Constitutional premises.

the course of the 60 years, the category is not neat.

25

But the turning point is in 1978 with the Coopers

Alderson Reporting Company

If we look over

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

opinion which says death knell, which says strategic

2

interactions, the shape of class actions, is not

3

available for appeal as a right.

4

In 1994, one might have thought of the

5

digital case that a contract not to continue by -- just

6

settle would have been within the set, but the Court

7

said, no, that kind of private contractual interest is

8

not sufficient.

9

And in 2006, in the Will case, the court

10

narrowed it again by saying the res judicata sequence is

11

insufficient.

12

have come down to basically qualified immunity or

13

Constitutionally-freighted -- structural or almost

14

abstract, not interpersonal dynamics of the litigation,

15

including contractual relationships or evidentiary

16

privileges.

17

So in the last decade the Cohen cases

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But are you suggesting

18

that -- that Cohen itself wouldn't come out the same way

19

today if the question of security for costs, whether

20

State or Federal, hadn't been settled?

21

MS. RESNIK:

Well, Cohen predates this -

22

the Congress's creation of 1292(b), which you mentioned

23

earlier, Justice Ginsburg.

24

is, when Cohen was initially decided it opened a window,

25

but in the relationship between Court and Congress, the

And so what it is looking at

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

judicial conference went to the Congress and said, We

2

need a broader window, and Congress adopted verbatim in

3

1958 the 1292(b) criteria which, clearly, Cohen would

4

have been eligible for or potentially eligible for, and

5

there are attorney-client privilege cases that do go off

6

under 1292(b).

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But it is a bit of a

8

hurdle, isn't it, since you do have to satisfy the

9

materially advanced -- the litigation and those other

10

criteria?

11

MS. RESNIK:

There are a few selective

12

waiver cases.

13

but you are completely right that it is a hurdle but we

14

have alternatives here as well.

15

-- once the Federal Court Study Committee suggested we

16

needed more appeal rights after the Coopers case,

17

Congress responded by authorizing the Court through its

18

rulemaking to provide interlocutory orders as final, and

19

23(f) is the next example, which also provides the

20

mechanism.

21

There are a few of these that come up,

As the example of the

routes.

The remedial prong of Cohen is amply responded

to here, because first, internal to the case, there

could be protective orders and limited disclosure.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Cohen opens the

Are you -- are you arguing

13

that the collateral order door is closed now?

14

that nobody else is going to get through that door?

15

MS. RESNIK:

That -

I can't forecast future cases,

16

except to say that this Court has repeatedly in the last

17

decade narrowed the door substantially.

18

it has come in relationship to the door opening through

19

the other mechanisms, Congressional carve-ups like the

20

Classified Informations Procedure Act, the Congressional

21

carve-up in Catha, and each of those isn't a wide-open

22

door, but either discretionary or timeframed or limited.

23

And of course, that goes to the problem that an

24

interlocutory appeal really is interlocutory and stops

25

everything, whereas the 23(f) rule says after the court

That's why 23(f) moderates that rule,

Further, I wanted to come back to the

question of state law.

turns on the question of state law as a predicate, and

18

the D.C. Circuit rule is that it's when there's an

19

adverse privilege ruling that you get appeal as a right.

20

It's -- that's the D.C. circuit's rule for -- and

21

indeed, it had several of these, not very many, but a

22

few of these cases.

23

I know of no one of the Erie

So then 502 has just come with the workings

24

of the judicial conference and the Congress together,

25

and the lawyers, to shape a rule that is very protective
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of inadvertent waiver, protective about its sequential

2

impacts as well, and articulating and Federalizing that

3

area of law, as well as providing under 502(a) for -- if

4

you waive in the course of a Federal proceeding, 502

5

organizes the way a district court should think about

6

it.

7

If there were appeal as a right of waiver

8

right now, after this case, then all those 502 cases

9

could come directly, whereas instead a few might get

10

here or not by 1292(b).

11

there needed to be a wholesale reworking because of the

12

vulnerability of the system, then the Court and

13

committee working with the lawyers can draft together

14

some revision.

15

And again, if it looked like

But the -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The usual way that

16

the district court, after denying the recognition of the

17

privilege, insists that people proceed is, they want the

18

lawyer to go to jail.

19

you can appeal contempt.

20

mentioned, they want these things to move on and they

21

tend not to think that their rulings are in error, and

22

the lawyers are frequently confronted with an extremely

23

difficult choice, of violating what they think is their

24

ethical obligation or going to jail.

25

MS. RESNIK:

The district judges, as you've

provision that is available.

4

we've found -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And it is a route.

And how -- how is it -

6

unless the judge cooperates, it has to be criminal

contempt.

8

says, I'm not going to hold you, and -

9

It wouldn't be civil contempt.

MS. RESNIK:

But

The judge

What -- we have found that many

10

courts of appeals have responded, precisely because of

11

either the draconian nature of criminal contempt or the

12

possibility that it won't issue, by looking at some of

13

these cases, in the extraordinary instance, through

14

mandamus and there are at least a dozen mandamus -

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But mandamus is supposed

16

-- not supposed to be a run about the final judgment

17

rule, and if -- and if Cohen v. Beneficial is available,

18

then mandamus would not lie, right?

19

MS. RESNIK:

That is directly -- that is

20

exactly correct, yes.

It is that the appeal of these

21

unappealing groups is because the final judgment rule

22

says even if there is an error and even if it's a very

23

important error, absent this very narrow category of

24

cases that are final through our gloss on Cohen, the

basic plan is you wait till the end.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

3

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

4

AS AMICUS CURIAE,

5

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

7

please the Court.

In the last 15 years, this Court, in

8

applying the principles of Cohen, has repeatedly

9

stressed that a necessary requirement is that the order

10

involved and the issues implicated be important and,

11

particularly, that the issues be so important as to

12

outweigh the values served by the important and usual

13

rule of a final judgment requirement.

14

In our view, the denial of an assertion of

15

attorney-client privilege in an individual case does not

16

rise to that level and to the -

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, except when

18

the government is the one raising it.

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

We do not -- we -- to be

20

clear, we are not asserting that an -- that an assertion

21

of attorney-client privilege by the government is -- is

22

immediately -

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, but, in the

24

government context, what would be in the private

25

context, an attorney-client privilege, is redressed as a
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

different type of governmental privilege.

2

When you give advice to a government agency,

3

you don't call that the attorney-client privilege.

4

call it a governmental privilege, a deliberative

privilege, all these other things.

MR. KNEEDLER:

It's the attorney-client

Let me also stress, we are

11

not arguing that a denial of the assertion of the

12

deliberative process privilege is immediately

13

appealable.

14

Our -- the -- the submission that we make in

15

the latter part of our brief, and that we urge the Court

16

not to foreclose here, is the Presidential

17

communications privilege, which applies to

18

communications involving the President or his top

19

advisors.

20

And we also say that the State secrets

21

privilege raises similar concerns.

functions of constitutional significance.

make the same claim about -- about the general

24

government privilege for deliberative process.

25

We do not

So you are saying

that you -- government lawyers cannot seek an

2

interlocutory appeal of any privilege claimed, other

3

than Presidential communications and State secrets?

13

interests of the highest order.

There are

We trust that a court

we will appeal your case, but we think you have got a

19

really bad case, you are likely to lose; and you

20

assert -- the only privilege you can assert is the

21

attorney-client privilege, and, if a district judge

22

says, that's not covered, for one reason or another,

23

you -- you don't get an interlocutory appeal?

24
25

MR. KNEEDLER:

Are you telling me, when

No.

Not -- we don't get an

interlocutory appeal under -- under 1291.
43
Alderson Reporting Company

No.

We are

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

not arguing for that -- for that position.

And, for the

2

two particular privileges that -- that we have

3

identified in our -- in our brief, it is possible that

4

1292(b) certification would be granted by the -- by the

5

Court, but it is also possible that it would not.

6

And I -- I would like to -- I would like to

7

identify -- and I think Justice Sotomayor asked about -

8

about a test for importance, and the Court, in its

9

recent decision in Will, tried to summarize what -- what

10

it has been driving at over the last 15 years on this

11

importance prong and whether the importance outweighs

12

the -- the final judgment values.

13

And what the Court said there is that there

14

has -- that the denial of an immediate appeal has to

15

undermine -- let me -- let me quote -- "has to undermine

16

some particular value of high order."

17

And then the Court identified the things

18

that have fallen into that category.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You don't think that

the attorney-client privileges rises to the level of who

gets to -- who has to put up security for costs that was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

an issue in Cohen?

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

We -- I think the -- I do

3

not.

And I think the problem is that the denial of

4

attorney-client privilege is tied up with discovery of

5

the sort that happens every day in Federal Court.

6

bound up with -- with discovery plans, that -

7

objections on relevance, materiality, various -- various

8

privileges.

9

It's

One of the important values served by the

10

final judgment rule is that the conduct of -- of

11

district court proceedings like that is committed to the

12

judgment and discretion of the district court, and if a

13

disappointed litigant could automatically run to the

14

court of appeals that undermines the ability of the

15

district court judge to manage the day-to-day -

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We are not talking

17

about -- I guess what, perhaps, the case comes down to

18

is, if you think the attorney-client privilege is like

19

every other evidentiary privilege that you have just

20

listed, relevance, materiality, all those sorts of

21

things, or if you think the attorney-client privilege is

22

different, even more important than who has to post

23

security for costs, because it is central to the rule of

24

law, because it is central to how the adversary system

25

functions.
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think the more precise

2

question, Mr. Chief Justice, is whether the -- the

3

question is whether the denial of an attorney-client

4

privilege threatens to -- so substantially undermine the

5

values of the privilege to warrant an immediate appeal,

6

and I think, as has been pointed out by several of the

7

Justices here, there are -- there are exceptions to the

8

privilege, which -- which will -- might undermine the

9

confidence people might have in it.

There are

10

uncertainties at trial.

11

determinations that would be subject to clearly

12

erroneous review on appeal.

13

why issues like this are committed to the district

14

court's discretion and reviewed on final judgment when

15

you can find out whether the error actually made a

16

difference on a particular case.

17

These are often fact-based

The very sorts of reasons

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But the review -- I

18

follow your answer but the review on final judgment is

19

meaningless.

20

I mean, the cat is out of the bag.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, it's not entirely

21

meaningless.

It can -- if the evidence was used in the

22

trial and had -- had a substantial impact you can have a

23

reversal of the judgment, and -- and the -- the injury

24

can be mitigated by saying that the -- that the evidence

25

cannot be -- cannot be used in the retrial.
46
Alderson Reporting Company

That is

1

not -

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The injury to the

3

party, but not the injury to the attorney-client

4

privilege.

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, again, the -- the

6

question is -- the attorney/client privilege is not for

7

competence in its own right but to encourage frank

8

communications in order to promote litigation in the

9

function of lawyers.

And the question is whether the

10

denial of a privilege in a particular case will so

11

undermine that privilege as a general matter to warrant

12

an immediate appeal.

13

no.

14

individual litigant we think is not a sufficient basis,

15

because the other cases that I mentioned, and that the

16

Court identified in Will are situations where the injury

17

transcends the particular case.

18

And we think the answer is clearly

And also the loss of the privilege to the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Kneedler, I think I

19

have this right, but correct me if I am wrong.

20

thought in Cohen v. Beneficial, it wasn't just a

21

question that we would like to get this legal question

22

settled, but, in fact, for many plaintiffs if security

23

for costs was something that the Plaintiff has to put up

24

up front, that would be the end of the lawsuit.

25

would be the practical end of the lawsuit.
47
Alderson Reporting Company

I

It

Unlike in an

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

attorney-client privilege, the suit goes on.

2

So Cohen v. Beneficial wasn't simply that

3

this was an important question unsettled under Erie, it

4

is the practical reality that plaintiffs who had to put

5

up security costs would be out of -

MR. KNEEDLER:

That's -- that's a very

important -- that's a very important point.

JUSTICE ALITO:

And I think

Well, Mr. Kneedler, is true

10

that true, that the case goes on?

11

the civil cases that get through discovery, only a tiny

12

percentage ever come to an appealable final judgment?

13

The vast, vast majority of these things are settled, are

14

they not?

think that supports the point for not having immediate

What I -- what I -- what I was suggesting is

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Putting aside the

22

question of whether the attorney-client privilege has a

good pedigree in public law, my experience has been that

litigants on one side frequently request and demand in

discovery material that they know is covered by the

Alderson Reporting Company

attorney-client privilege, one, precisely because that's

where the good stuff is; and two, because it gives them

But, again, as for privileges generally,

19

that -- that harm is immediate and broad on behalf of

13

MR. ALLEN:

Has that ever happened?

I am unaware that it has -- it

has ever happened, Your Honor, and I hope it doesn't.

But the -- but point is that the district court

16

maintains that power and authority to run -- to run its

17

courtroom.

18

The United States cites Will for the

19

proposition that -- that the collateral order doctrine

20

is designed to impact some particular value of high

21

order, and it recites from Will a number of those

22

particular values of high order, including qualified

23

immunity.

24

a -- a doctrine of common law origin, much like the

25

attorney-client privilege, the -- the doctrine in

As this Court recognized in -- in Harlow,

2

affect the efficient operation of government.

The design of the attorney-client privilege

4

is intended to have the same impact on the efficient and

5

effective operation of the administration of justice.

6

If I could go back, Justice Breyer, to the

7

question that you raised with regard to other privilege.

8

I would suggest that a holding in this case in our favor

9

would have no impact on the Court's later determination

10

of privileges of husband, wife, spousal privileges, or

11

of priest and penitent type privileges.

12

that the better course would be to examine a case that

13

develops the importance or the impact of those

14

privileges, but certainly with regard, for example, to

15

spousal immunity or spousal privilege, the way that the

16

States recognize them -- I believe that all 50 States

17

recognize spousal privilege -- is varied.
