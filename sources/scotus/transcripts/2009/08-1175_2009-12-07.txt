ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH W. JACQUOT

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

We will hear

MR. JACQUOT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

As courts have recognized, Miranda warnings

11

protect Fifth Amendment rights and promote voluntary

12

confessions, confessions important to seeking truth,

13

solving crimes, and securing justice.

14

Supreme Court erred in two ways to suppress a voluntary

15

confession relied upon for Kevin Powell's conviction.

Yet the Florida

First, the Florida court misapplied the

16
17

analysis.

18

reasonably conveyed standard for the right to an

19

attorney, the court strictly parsed the warning, seeking

20

certain words in a certain order.

21

Rather than evaluating the warning under a

Second, the court incorrectly found the

22

warning to be misleading.

The court ignored the

23

totality of the warning.

24

order in which the rights were given, and furthermore,

25

the court applied a hypertechnical analysis of the

The court overemphasized the

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

warning's language.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you agree that it --

3

suppose we accept your position and the case is

4

remanded.

5

that's very nice, but we have a Florida Constitution

6

with a counterpart to the Fifth Amendment, so we're just

7

going to have the same opinion, but we are putting it

8

under -- squarely under the Florida Constitution.

9
10

The Florida Supreme Court could say:

Well,

They could do that?
MR. JACQUOT:

Your Honor, the Florida court

11

theoretically could, but the Florida court would have to

12

do that on State grounds, and in this case, they relied

13

on Federal grounds to reach this decision.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15
16

Yes, that's what I meant.

They could do it on State grounds.
MR. JACQUOT:

Theoretically.

But this Court

17

found in Evans v. Arizona that just because of the

18

theoretical possibility that a court could write its

19

opinion differently on State grounds, this Court still

20

had jurisdiction because the original opinion rested on

21

Federal grounds.

22
23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

JUSTICE SCALIA:
term?

There’s a retention election when?

7
8

How -- how long is their

MR. JACQUOT:

Correct.

There is a retention

election every 4 years.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Every 4 years.

And they'd

10

have to run for their retention election on the ticket

11

that "We've expanded Miranda for Florida purposes,"

12

right?

13
14
15

MR. JACQUOT:

Well, Your Honor, they are

elected.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Has the -- has the Florida

16

Supreme Court ever explicitly interpreted -- what is it?

17

Article I, section 8, of the Florida Constitution more

18

expansively than -- and explicitly so -- and explicitly

19

so, than Miranda?

20

MR. JACQUOT:

No, Your Honor.

The Florida

21

Supreme Court has said that the possibility is there,

22

but in its decisions it has found -- particularly in

23

the case before you --

24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:
case, didn't they?

Well, they did it in this

Under your view, they –- their

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

ruling goes beyond Miranda, and they said that the

2

Florida Constitution requires this result.

3

MR. JACQUOT:

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

5

No, Justice -So they did do it in this

very case.

6

MR. JACQUOT:

No, Justice Stevens.

7

court specifically relied on Federal law.

8

it wrong.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

the Florida Constitution, did it not?

11

MR. JACQUOT:

13

It just got

But it also cited the --

10

12

The

It cited the Florida

Constitution -JUSTICE STEVENS:

And did it not also say

14

that this was a violation of the Federal -- I mean, of

15

the Florida Constitution?

16

MR. JACQUOT:

Yes, Your Honor, it mentioned

17

the Florida Constitution.

However, in those same

18

sentences, it interwove Federal law.

19

Under the Florida Constitution and according to Miranda.

20

And this Court in Michigan v. Long has found that

21

opinions that interweave State and Federal law are

22

appropriate for this Court's jurisdiction.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It would say:

One of your amici -- one

24

of the amici suggested that the Florida courts cannot

25

read the Florida Constitution more expansively than the

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Federal requirements.

2

proposition?

Are you rejecting that

MR. JACQUOT:

3

We do indeed, Your Honor.

The

4

Florida court in Powell read the warning to -- in line

5

with Miranda.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And it's a different

7

question.

8

Constitution and Florida case law says that they can't

9

read the Florida Constitution more broadly than it is

10

One of the amici suggests that the Florida

read under Federal law.
MR. JACQUOT:

11

Well, Your Honor, the past

12

cases have said that the Florida court could, but they

13

haven't.

14

And in this case they particularly did not.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So this could be a

15

first, if we were to start from the proposition that

16

Justice Ginsburg did?

17

MR. JACQUOT:

Well, Your Honor, under

18

Michigan v. Long the test is to look at the clear face

19

of the opinion, to look for a plain statement that this

20

case relied on adequate -- adequate and independent

21

State grounds, and that is not there.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do -- do you see a

23

conflict between the language of our decisions where we

24

often say that Miranda rights have to be clear and those

25

decisions that say that whatever is said has to

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

reasonably convey the essence of the Miranda warnings?

2

Is there a difference between those two

3

statements, and which of our cases or statements would

4

control?

5

MR. JACQUOT:

Your Honor, in Miranda the

6

Court did use the terms "clearly inform."

7

Court has gone on in Prysock to use the term "adequately

8

inform" and Duckworth uses the word "reasonably convey."

9

So, yes, although the rights are consistent from Miranda

10

However, this

on -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

So you would suggest

12

that if something is not clear and it's ambiguous, that

13

that's enough?

14

reasonable and clarity?

15

certain way; otherwise an ambiguous warning --

Or -- or is there a difference between

MR. JACQUOT:

16

That has to be read in a

No, Your Honor, I would say

17

that this Court has said that clarity is judged by

18

whether the warnings reasonably convey the rights under

19

Miranda; that's the standard.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Did Miranda itself -- I

21

mean, it set out the four requirements, but there was a

22

charge -- I mean there was a warning involved, am I not

23

right?

24

has been improved considerably, but there was an FBI

25

warning cited in Miranda itself, was there not?

Well, didn't they cite the then-FBI warning?

8

MR. JACQUOT:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and

2

that warning conveyed only the right to attorney.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It

It also said you have a

right to keep silent.

6

MR. JACQUOT:

Correct.

But on the right to

8

suspect has the ability to consult counsel.

9

go into the specific -- detail, the explicit nature of

It did not

10

spelling out the terms "present" and the terms "during"

11

that the Florida Supreme Court required.

12

real issue here before the Court, is whether the Florida

13

Supreme Court applied a standard that is significantly

14

different than the standard that this Court has

15

required.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It told them:

And that's the

You are

17

entitled to confer with counsel before answering

18

questions, right?

19

MR. JACQUOT:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

the warning given -- given in this case?

22

entitled to consult counsel before answering questions?

23

MR. JACQUOT:

What warning, Justice Scalia?
Wasn't that -- wasn't that
You are

Yes, the warning in this case

24

said you have the right to talk to a lawyer before

25

answering any of our questions.

And, furthermore --

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

2

to make sure; you've said two different things.

3

"any of our questions," right?

4

MR. JACQUOT:

Now, "any" –- just
It says

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the

5

warning said, "You have the right to talk to a lawyer

6

before answering any of our questions."

7

warning went on to say, "You have the right to use this

8

right at any time during this interview."

9
10
11

And then the

We would argue that this expresses all the
rights required under Miranda.
JUSTICE BREYER:

What about the right in

12

Miranda that says -- in Miranda -- "We hold an

13

individual held for interrogation must be clearly

14

informed that he has the right to consult with the

15

lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during

16

interrogation."

17

Okay?

Where does it say that?

Interpret it any

18

way you want.

19

In a grand jury, he can go consult with a lawyer, but he

20

doesn't have the lawyer with him.

21

tell him that?

22
23

You know, we are used to grand juries.

MR. JACQUOT:

So, where does it

Well, Your Honor, the standard

being “reasonably convey” --

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

MR. JACQUOT:

Yes.

-- the warning lays out that

10

1

you have the right --

2
3

JUSTICE BREYER:

point to the words that tell him that.

4

MR. JACQUOT:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

I'm just asking you to

The right to talk to a lawyer.
Don't have you a right to

talk to a lawyer at a grand jury?

7

MR. JACQUOT:

Yes, but a -- Your Honor, a

8

grand jury operates very differently than a criminal

9

interrogation.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, correct.

And so

11

aren't you supposed to tell this person, that unlike a

12

grand jury, you have a right to have the lawyer with you

13

during interrogation?

14

said in passing in Miranda.

15

about it.

16

warning you have the right to have the lawyer with you

17

during the interrogation?

18

I mean, it isn't as if that was
They wrote eight paragraphs

And I just wonder, where does it say in this

MR. JACQUOT:

Well, Justice Breyer, I would

19

have three responses to that.

20

FBI warning did not use the terms "present," did not use

21

the terms "with you," and --

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

First, under Miranda the

It doesn't use the word

23

"present," Miranda?

It says right here:

24

it says -- "not just prior to questioning, but also to

25

have counsel present during any questioning."

11
Alderson Reporting Company

"We hold" --

That's

Official

1

what Miranda says.

And then Miranda, after discussing

2

it for five pages, goes on to use the words I just said.

3

You have to tell him he has the right to have counsel

4

with him.

So it does use the word "present."

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It -- it used it in

6

determining -- in -- in stating the obligation of the

7

State, but it didn't use those words in setting out the

8

warning that the FBI then gave.

9

MR. JACQUOT:

10

Correct.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It said, this is what --

11

States, this is what your obligation is, what you must

12

say to the defendant is.

13

is the same way.

14

of a lawyer.

15

-- but what it said had to be communicated was not the

16

-- the full range.

17

was, to the help of a lawyer.

18

It said:

And I think the Florida court
You are entitled to the help

Then it spells it out in that opinion, but

Just you're entitled, I think it

So there’s -- there’s a confusion, I

19

think, between what Miranda spells out and many other

20

cases spell out as the State’s obligation, what the

21

State must do, and the statement that must be made to

22

the defendant to communicate that.

23

MR. JACQUOT:

Justice Ginsburg, let me be

24

very clear and answer Justice Breyer with the three

25

points I began.

Miranda requires that law enforcement

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

effectively communicate the fact that you can access

2

your right to an attorney present and during an

3

interrogation.

4

approvingly cited the FBI warning that only had the

5

terms -- the generalized warning:

6

However, in the Miranda opinion they

Consult with counsel.

Furthermore, the ability to talk to your

7

lawyer, which is at issue in this warning, is the first

8

natural step to getting your attorney.

9

And, third, as this Court has held in

10

Minnick, that it’s the representation that matters in

11

custodial interrogations --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, what FBI are we

13

talking about?

Because the FBI advice of rights says:

14

"You have the right to have a lawyer with you during

15

questioning."

16

the fact, "We hold that an individual must be clearly

17

informed."

Were they -- and -- and I was taken by

And so, is there some other case that

18
19

says -- or some other FBI statement that they give

20

people that doesn't use the words "with you," that says

21

you don't have to say "with you during," or doesn't have

22

to say "present during"?

23

said that?

24
25

MR. JACQUOT:
warning does have that.

Was there some other case that

Your Honor, the current FBI
However, there have been

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

several cases in the circuits that have held generalized

2

warnings to be sufficient, warnings that say only the

3

right to an attorney.

4

And one of the issues --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The -- the warning that

5

Justice Breyer has just referred to -- that’s long after

6

Miranda itself, and it was not the warning that the FBI

7

gave at the time of Miranda.

8

MR. JACQUOT:

Correct, Your Honor.

And --

9

and that is the issue, is what is, first, the standard

10

that courts must currently apply in terms of whether a

11

warning reasonably conveys.

12

analysis that the Florida court applied.

13

That is not the standard of

And secondly, when evaluating that warning,

14

the -- the Florida court incorrectly finds that this

15

warning was misleading.

Now --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

I have a difficulty in

17

terms of this argument about burdening law enforcement.

18

This is a preprinted form that the police made up,

19

correct?

20

MR. JACQUOT:

Correct.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what's the added

22

burden by making the form absolutely and abundantly

23

clear or conforming the form to the statements in

24

Miranda?

25

to print the form anyway.

What's the cost to the State?

They’re going

They are telling their

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

officers to read from the form anyway.

2

cost?
MR. JACQUOT:

3

What's the added

Your Honor, there are three

4

reasons why the Florida Supreme Court's explicit

5

standard is problematic.

6

applies to written warnings as to verbal warnings.

7

you’ve had situations where you have a law enforcement

8

officer who doesn't have his card in the field; there’s

9

a verbal error; there’s an inconsistency in

First, the same standard
So

10

translations.

If a suspect is asking questions trying

11

to get clarity, the law enforcement officer is going

12

outside of the card to provide that clarity.

13

situations that may not meet the explicit express advice

14

standard of the Court.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

Those are

Well, there is a

16

question about how much the subjective intent of the

17

questioner should be involved in this process or not.

18

There are cases where it appears the plurality of

19

our Court has said it should always be an objective

20

standard, and others where certain members have

21

expressed a question about subjective.
But if we are dealing with a printed form,

22
23

why wouldn't the intent of the entity at issue be placed

24

in question?

25

could have chosen to be explicit, but instead they chose

Meaning, you could have -- the police here

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to be -- to obfuscate a little bit and be less explicit.

2

Shouldn't we assume that that’s an intent to deceive or

3

perhaps to confuse?

4

MR. JACQUOT:

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

5

The Tampa Police, in having this warning drafted, is

6

attempting to reasonably convey the warning, and there

7

is good public policy reasons why.

8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But why?

The -- the

easy solution is to do what 90 percent of the

10

jurisdictions are doing:

11

MR. JACQUOT:

Copy Miranda.
Well, Your Honor, we would

12

claim that this warning falls within the 97 percent

13

cited by amici because it has the word "during" in the

14

warning.

The Florida court ignored the totality of the

15

warning.

It chose to place the order of the warning's

16

rights in a way that this Court in Prysock and Duckworth

17

has found is not the proper analysis.

18

Furthermore, this court used a

19

hypertechnical approach.

It took the words "before

20

answering any of our questions," turned that into an

21

exclusive statement to say, "only before questioning"

22

and then, as a result of that, attempted to discount the

23

last sentence of the warning.

24

parsing, that's the kind of precise formulation, that's

25

the kind of construing warnings like a will or defining

That's the kind of

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

terms like an easement that this Court has rejected.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the danger

3

that Tampa, if you should prevail, will go back to the

4

old way?

5

form was adequate is one thing.

6

form that the -- like the one the FBI currently uses.

7

If you prevail, then Tampa can go back to what it had

8

before?

9

Now, it has a clearer form -- whether this

MR. JACQUOT:

But now, it has the

Your Honor, you are correct,

10

in that Tampa has a new form now that does have the

11

words "present" and "during" in a different formulation.

12

However, there’s no indication that they

13

would go back to the other form, for several reasons.

14

One, law enforcement has an incentive to have Miranda

15

rights properly given because they desire there to be

16

confessions and for those confessions to be admissible.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, once we say this is

18

properly given, my goodness, here's -- here's an

19

instruction approved specifically by this Court.

20

mean, I think they should use that, don't you?

21

I mean, the other one they are going to have

22

to guess about, but this one is approved in a case

23

involving Florida by this Court.

24

attractive to use that one.

25

I

MR. JACQUOT:

You are arguing that it's perfectly okay, so why

So when a litigation

Let me -- let me ask you

20

one question.

Isn't it the case that this particular

21

warning is used in one judicial district, and the

22

warning that was approved in Traylor was used in the

23

rest of the State?

24

Florida

And so there is an interest -- the

throughout the State.

2

one standard warning in one judicial district, and the

3

other districts may continue to use the one they have

4

used in the past.

5

And if you prevail, there may be

Isn't that right?

MR. JACQUOT:

Well, Justice Stevens, it is

6

not true that every jurisdiction in Florida uses this

7

same warning.

8
9
10

There are varieties of warnings.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That's true, but if you --

if they all followed the Florida Supreme Court in this
case, then they all would use the same warning?
MR. JACQUOT:

11

Well, Justice Stevens, if they

12

were all following the Florida Supreme Court here, they

13

would have to explicitly state certain terms in their

14

warning.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

already.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID O'NEIL

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

13

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

14
15
16

MR. O'NEIL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
I’d like to go directly to Justice

17

Ginsburg's question about what would happen if this

18

Court affirmed the warnings in this case, and I think

19

Respondent's amici make the argument that it will

20

somehow promote a race to the bottom.

21

And I think that history and experience are

22

the best answer to that question.

Respondent's amici,

23

who have carefully studied this issue, have found that

24

some police officers have attempted to evade Miranda by

25

interrogation techniques, but there is no indication

20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that police have tried to accomplish that purpose by

2

changing the language of the warnings, and that is not

3

because they couldn't do so.

4

Duckworth and Prysock have been on the books, and have

5

made clear that no standard formulation of the warnings

6

is necessary and that variant warnings will be upheld.

7

And if it were true --

8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

For the last 20 years,

Except that Justice

Scalia just pointed out, if we approve the language of

10

this, then -- of this particular warning, it becomes the

11

new sort of floor.
And if we make it the new floor, it --

12
13

doesn't it provide an incentive for police departments

14

to move away from the explicit warnings that say “during

15

and” -- “before and during” interrogations; now we're

16

saying -- you know, generalize them more.

17

MR. O'NEIL:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, Justice -Aren't we encouraging

that?
MR. O'NEIL:

Justice Sotomayor, I have two

21

responses to that:

22

the warning in Duckworth, which said, we have no way of

23

providing you an attorney, but one will be provided if

24

and when you go to court.

25

The first is that this Court upheld

Now, if you -- if it were true that police

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

were looking for every way to get around the warnings

2

and if changing the warnings were an effective way to do

3

that, we should have seen every jurisdiction adopt those

4

warnings.

5

In fact, of the 900 warnings that are

6

included in the survey that Respondent relies heavily

7

on, only 5 have that formulation.

8

circuit courts have held --

Duckworth?

Do you know?
MR. O'NEIL:

11

Second, four

I don't -- it doesn't indicate

12

when they were adopted, but I think it's fair to say

13

that, if police did have that incentive, that we would

14

have seen at least some jurisdictions adopt that

15

warning.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. O'NEIL:

They can, and we think that’s

unlikely, and if the concern here is that it will

4

destroy the uniformity that the Federal government

5

thinks is a good thing as a matter of policy, we think

6

that that concern is simply not warranted.

7

do agree that these warnings adequately convey the

8

substance --

9
10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Excuse me.

But, yes, we

You think lack

of uniformity is a good idea?
MR. O'NEIL:

11

No, we think that affirming

12

these warnings will not disrupt the uniformity that

13

seems to be in place around the country, and -- for

14

exactly the reason that I said, Justice Kennedy, because

15

Justice Sotomayor mentioned general right to counsel

16

warnings, that if we upheld a general right to counsel

17

warning, that jurisdictions would begin to drop the more

18

specific language that’s contained, for example, in the

19

FBI form.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20
21

that?

22

FBI form?

The

Where -- where is that set forth?
MR. O'NEIL:

I don't believe the FBI form is

24

set out in full.

It's on pages 383 and 384 of Miranda,

25

and the description of the court's discussion is on page

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

29 of our brief.

2

And I think, Justice Sotomayor, it’s

3

significant that four circuit courts have upheld general

4

right to counsel warnings of the kind that were in the

5

FBI warnings in 1966.

6

those jurisdictions have not abandoned the more specific

7

language that is contained in the FBI formulation.

In

What -- how do we deal

10

with the fact that, if the purpose of Miranda is to give

11

clear warnings, and your adversary says -- not your

12

adversary -- your co-counsel -- Petitioner's counsel

13

says that means -- "clear" means does it reasonably

14

convey?
We've got a split of circuit courts and

15

State courts on whether this reasonably conveys or not.

17

Shouldn't that be enough of an ambiguity for us to

18

conclude it can't reasonably convey, if there's this

19

many courts holding that it doesn't?

20

MR. O'NEIL:

No, Justice Sotomayor.

This is

21

not like a qualified immunity inquiry, where grounds for

22

debate among reasonable jurists would invalidate the

23

warning.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Are you calling the

Florida State Supreme Court majority unreasonable

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

jurists?

2

MR. O'NEIL:

No, I think -- I think the

3

problem with a standard that permits of no ambiguity is

4

that, as Florida just said, this standard will apply,

5

not just to printed forms -- and it is easy enough to

6

create a printed form in advance that includes more

7

specific language -- but it will also apply to

8

inadvertent departures from the standard forms as a

9

result of mistake.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What happens now is that

11

we are dealing with the exception rather than the rule,

12

and -- but this was the rule, meaning this was the form

13

that they were reading.

14

ambiguity in it, sufficient for at least one court to

15

say it wasn't sufficiently clear, it wasn't explicit

16

enough, should we worry about the exception as an

17

exception?

18

MR. O'NEIL:

And if it has some significant

Well, I think -- I think the

19

exception is -- needs to be captured within the rule

20

that this Court adopts as -- as the standard.

21

I -- I also think that it -- it is -- it's

22

simply not the case that if this Court, as I said,

23

adopts a standard that permits a less explicit, less

24

precise warning than the FBI wants --

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. O'Neil, isn't one of

the problems here that Florida had two different printed

wiser generally to have the same form used throughout

It is.

16

it is wiser to do that, and the Federal law enforcement

17

agencies do that because it avoids --

requires it, right?
MR. O'NEIL:

not require the precise words of Miranda.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

says the Constitution requires this warning, and if the

24

warning must be in a standard form that everybody uses,

the Constitution must require a standard form that

MR. O'NEIL:

I just want to know where in this

Justice Breyer, there is no

reason to think that a suspect who hears that he can

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

talk to an attorney before answering any questions and

2

during this interview would infer the unstated

3

restriction that he can talk to an attorney but only by

phone or only remotely --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Really?

I guess anybody

6

who has had prior experience with the law, as this man

7

might have done, might be familiar with a grand jury

8

proceeding.

9

MR. O'NEIL:

But for the same reason we

10

don't ask whether the suspect has sufficient knowledge

11

to supplement the information he needs.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

you:

No, no, no.

But I tell

Here's your right to talk to a lawyer before

17

can assert that right whenever you want, to talk to him

before questioning.

19

MR. O'NEIL:

Well --

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

And my question is, how

21

does that tell him he has a right to have a lawyer with

22

him during questioning, that the questioning he has a

23

right to have take place from beginning to end in the

24

presence of a lawyer, a matter that the Miranda Court

25

repeated three times in the summary and wrote eight

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

full paragraphs about why that was important?

2

MR. O'NEIL:

Well, first, as Justice

3

Ginsburg noted, Miranda went out of its way to -- to

4

specifically approve an FBI warning that said, quote --

5
6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Where does it say it

approves that?

7

MR. O'NEIL:

It said this pattern of

8

warnings is consistent with the decision that we

9

announced today.

And I think --

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MR. O’NEIL: -- it couldn’t have been

12

clearer.

13
14

It wasn't though, actually.

JUSTICE BREYER:
consistent with it.

That's interesting.

MR. O'NEIL:

15

It isn't -- it isn't

Well, that argument was made by

16

Justice Clark in dissent, and the Court did not agree

17

with that.

18

thought that --

19
20

And I think it is clear that the Court

JUSTICE BREYER:

They didn't say anything

about during.

21

MR. O'NEIL:

Well, no, they didn't.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

So anyway -- then they

23

don't need to mention “during” at all because if that's

24

right, the FBI warning at that time, J. Edgar Hoover's

25

letter or whatever it was, just talked about telling

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you, you have a right to counsel.

2

anything about “during.”
MR. O'NEIL:

3

It doesn't say

Well, I think that's exactly

4

the point, that you don't assume that a suspect is only

5

capable of understanding --

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

So then you think that, in

7

fact, going by that warning, that there is no

8

constitutional right to have them say a word about

9

during.

10
11

This would be okay if they said nothing at all

about it.
MR. O'NEIL:

I think a -- a -- advice of the

12

right to counsel or, as the Court put it in a different

13

place in the Miranda opinion, the right to obtain the

14

services of an attorney of his choice, that would be

15

constitutionally adequate.

16

not use those warnings because they create a list -- a

17

risk of litigation.

18

The Federal Government does

We think that's the correct reading of

19

Miranda, but that, of course, is not guarantee that

20

other courts would read it that way.

21

years after Miranda, the Fifth Circuit had gone the

22

other way and decided that, in fact, a right to counsel

23

warning is not sufficient.

24
25

And, indeed, 2

But, Justice Breyer, I think that the answer
to how these warnings convey presence is that a suspect

30
Alderson Reporting Company

is not going to draw the highly counterintuitive

2

assumption that if he is told that he can have an

substantively or otherwise different than the FBI

18

warnings that some believe were approved in Miranda.

19

Are these equivalent?

20

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

I don't -- I believe

21

that -- that requiring the presence of counsel during

22

the interrogation goes a little bit -- a lot further.

23

And it -- it is not equivalent to the FBI.

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't disagree with

you, but that wasn't my question.

My question was, did

Not at issue because it

It wasn't.
But that was reviewed

and approved in Miranda, did it give that -MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

No, it did not.

And that

why -- and that's why I don't believe the Court in

10

Miranda ever said we -- it's consistent with, but they

11

never said, we approve.

12

adopting that language.

13

They never said, we are

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is -- is there since

14

then -- I mean, as I read it now I see that, as I said,

15

it seems very clear that they intend you to have to say

16

that the counsel has to be -- is present with you.

17

Present, okay?

18

is consistent, don't say that.

Now the FBI warnings, which they did say

No, they don't.
They don't.
They do not.
Okay.

Now, since the time

23

of Miranda, has this Court ever talked about that?

24

there been any lower court or have there been -- has the

25

practice of the departments to any great extent been

38

such that they stopped talking, or did not talk, or

never spoke about a right to have a counsel with you

4

5

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

They

It wasn't --

No, the case law has

6

always referred to both, both by this Court and then --

7

and then the circuit courts.

8

And the --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This Court said in Miranda

JUSTICE BREYER:

This Court has referred

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

13

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

9

--

10
11

to “during.”

Has -- has -- in many

14

opinions, it talked about before interrogation and

15

during interrogation the right to have counsel present.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But I must say I -- this is

17

–- this is angels dancing on the head of a pin.

You

18

want us to believe that your client, who decided to

19

talk, even though he was told he could consult an

20

attorney before any question was asked, and he could

21

consult an attorney at any time during the interview,

22

and he went ahead and -- and confessed -- you are

23

saying, oh, if he had only known.

24

could have an attorney present during the interview,

25

well, that would have been a different kettle of fish

Oh, if I knew that I

39

and I would never have confessed.

2
3

I mean, doesn't that seem to you quite
fantastic?

4

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

No, Your Honor,

5

especially not with a reasonable suspect that's being

6

questioned.

7

There -- there -- we are not talking

8

about reasonable lawyers or reasonable justices; we are

9

talking about --

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, how about the

11

reasonable defendant in this very case?

Powell's lawyer

12

questioned him and asked him:

13

have an attorney present during your questioning by the

14

detectives?"

"You waived the right to

15

Answer:

"Yes."

16

This is at appendix page 80.

So,

17

apparently, counsel understood the warning to have

18

conveyed the right to have an attorney present during

19

questioning by the -- by the detectives.

20

understood that?

Counsel

21

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

No, counsel --

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Did she ever --

23

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

-- never -- never asked

24

him did you knowingly waive; did you intelligently

25

waive?

She was trying to set up the fact that the

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

client had waived his rights before he made a statement

2

in order to get to his -- his argument that his

3

statements were coerced.

4

But she was never giving up the argument

5

that she had made previously to that -- that testimony

6

that -- that the waiver was knowing and intelligent.

7

She just had already lost that argument in front of the

8

judge, and now she was addressing the jury.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Was she asking her client

10

a legal question?

11

attorney present during your questioning by detectives,

12

is that what you are telling the jury?

13

You waived the right to have an

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

Yes.

Well, he did waive

14

his rights, but he didn't knowingly and intelligently

15

waive his rights, and he did sign the form.

16

that was the next question:

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Because

Did you sign the form?
Do you think that the

18

average person hearing this warning would envision the

19

sort of procedure that occurs before a grand jury?

20

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

22
23

I don't --

That's what it would be

taken to mean?
MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

I -- I don't think most

24

-- most people have been in front of a grand jury, so I

25

don't envision that they would have that kind

41
Alderson Reporting Company

1

of reaction.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But do --

3

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

I think they would focus

4

on the “before.”

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you think that a

6

suspect would think, now, I'm in this custodial room,

7

they want me to stay put, that they’re going to have me

8

hopping in and out of the room to talk to my lawyer?

9

Wouldn't the assumption be, I'm stuck in this room, they

10

are holding me here, and if I have a right to talk to a

11

lawyer, it's got to be there and not my walking in and

12

out of the holding room.

13

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

And a right -- but they

14

never told him that he’d have the ability to talk to a

15

lawyer during the interrogation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

Is there -- is there

17

any -- I'm not sure this is pertinent -- but is there

18

any malevolent reason Tampa police would adopt this

FBI uses.

21

just say you have a right to an attorney before

22

answering any questions and then later say you can

23

exercise this right any time, maybe we'll be able to

24

trick some people who don't think they can actually have

25

the lawyer there.

I mean, someone says, well, here's what the
And they say, well, I tell you what, if we

In other words was this just --

1

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

It's -- it's hard for us

2

to be able to delve into the minds of the Tampa Police

3

Department and the people who create these forms.

4

However, in the Thompson case, which is before you in

5

the briefs, in 1984, they had it right.

6

have the right to talk to an attorney beforehand and to

7

the presence of an attorney during interrogation.

8

was in a death case, and there was something wrong with

9

the right to free counsel.

10

They said you

This

They either didn't give it

to them or not.
So why they went and changed the part to the

11
12

right to an attorney before -- before the questioning,

13

and then during questioning, we don't know.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14
15

So -- and you can't

think of any bad reason they might have done it.
MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

16

Well, Professor Leo

17

could, and there is a memo he attaches at the end of his

18

appendix in the amicus brief, but I -- I would just say

19

that it doesn't really matter what the motives are, and

20

that it all depends on how the defendant or the person

21

in custody is -- is perceiving these warnings and

22

whether he's getting the information he or she needs to

23

be --

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What do you do with the

-- the Court’s decisions in Prysock and Duckworth that

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

dealt with the right to appointed counsel and the

2

suspect was not explicitly told that he had a right to

3

appointed counsel at the pre-arraignment stage.

4

something about a court would give you --

5

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

Right.

It said

The -- the

6

language in those cases had something to do with -- you

7

know, the idea being that, it was almost

8

informational -- too much information, additional

9

information as to when you’re going to get your

10

counsel.

But the four core -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

You wouldn't have to have

12

any additional information; you just tell them, you have

13

a right to have a -- have counsel now.

14

fewer words.

15

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

That would be

Well, they -- in Prysock

16

it was a matter of the order, but in Duckworth it was,

17

we can't get one for you at this moment kind of thing.

18

And no State is obligated -- or agency -- to provide

19

counsel on demand.

20
21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Didn't one of them say

"court," and the suspect was not in court at the time?

22

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

Was not in court?

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.

24
25

That the court will

appoint counsel for you.
MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

2

did tell them that if you’re going -- if you’re going to

3

be questioned, you have the right to counsel with you at

4

that time.

5

we had to wait, they couldn't question him until he had

6

his attorney with him.

7

But -- but they did -- but they

And that was the important thing.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Even if

If this warning is read the

8

way we might -- lawyers might read a statute or a

9

contract or something like that, then I don't know why

10

saying, "You have the right to remain silent," isn't

11

potentially misleading.

12

remain silent.

13

is nothing in there that says you have the right to

14

resume your silence.

It says you have the right to

But once you break your silence, there

15

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

17

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

No.

Would you agree with that?
Except for that -- that

18

catch-all phrase that they used at the bottom, which is

19

you have the right to use any of these at any time.

20
21
22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think that is

defective, too?
MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

Well, I think that it --

23

it's probably okay as far as reinforcing the right to

24

remain silent and informing him that any of your answers

25

can be used against you, but I don't think it salvages a

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

right that's not there, which is the right to presence

2

during interrogation.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

So once you break your --

4

you have the right to remain silent, but once you break

5

that right, the fact that you have that right to use

6

that right to remain silent in the future doesn't mean

7

you can stop answering questions.

8
9

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

Well, the -- the

catch-all phrase might inform them that they could stop,

10

but, clearly, if they had the right to presence of

11

counsel with them, that might --

12
13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We could write that down.

It could be the next case.

14

(Laughter.)

15

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

Right.

And I do -- I

16

also contest the language that the opposing counsel uses

17

that says that we have somehow locked in everybody with

18

-- with what the -- what the decision below said.

19

The decision below held that, and I quote at

20

541, "We hold that Powell should have been clearly

21

informed of his right to the presence of counsel during

22

the custodial interrogation."

23

It's not so -- so written in stone that -- it's not

24

explicit language.

25

It's not magic language.

There’s -- there’s -- this language follows

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what this -- this Court has said.

2

language, the clearly informed language.

3

locking everyone into these exact words down the line.

4

And there are hundreds of ways that this could be said.

5

So -- and then the court noted that the catch-all phrase

6

did not effectively convey to Mr. Powell his rights to

7

presence before and during and that the last sentence

8

could not effectively convey a right that he was never

9

told he had.

10

The reasonable
It isn't

As far as whether or not this case should

11

even be here, even though the Florida Constitution and

12

the Florida court has gone along the same road, traveled

13

a parallel road with this Court, and it hasn't seen a

14

need to deviate, they -- they may see a need to deviate

15

here, should this Court disagree with what --

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, they are -- they

17

are free to do that.

18

consider it risky, but if we say that the charge was

19

good enough, the Florida court could say, but it's not

20

good enough under our Constitution.

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

Correct.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- the Florida Supreme

6

Court must have referred to its constitutional

7

provision, Article I, section 9, at least five times.

8
9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And in each time, it said

that it was by extension from Miranda.

It always linked

10

it, and that was the question that was presented in the

11

State court --

12

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

Right.

And the --

-- that it certified.
It's almost like Miranda

15

is being used as a generic concept for warnings -- you

16

know, we’re complying with Miranda --

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's the whole reason we

18

have jurisdiction, so that Miranda will not be confused,

19

and so that it won't be a hazard on the landscape when

20

people say "Miranda" and they mean something else.

21

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Right, but -- you know -And it's not at all clear

6

You can't go lower than

It's -- maybe in some

Not necessarily in this one, because Long

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

Well, in -- in Traylor,

7

which is the court that -- it’s the case that the -- the

8

Florida Supreme Court and the decision below relied

9

heavily upon, they said that we are the ceiling and the

10
11

court is the bottom, and -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you have no case in

12

which the Florida Supreme Court has explicitly said that

13

we have a warning that is more strict, more rigorous

14

than what Miranda requires?

15

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

You have no case?
No, and they -- they

16

didn't feel like they had to -- to deviate, because they

17

felt like their definition of presence of counsel, which

18

was the right to consult with an attorney before and the

19

right to have counsel present during the interrogation,

20

was consistent with the holdings in Miranda.

21

didn't feel the need to deviate.

22
23
24
25

So they

But they did say that that is our definition
as we set forth in -- in Traylor, and that is -JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm curious:

When this

goes back to them, do you think they can deviate?

49
Alderson Reporting Company

They

Official

1

were answering a certified question, which was simply

2

whether this -- this warning complied with Miranda.

3

That was the only certified question.

4

So when it goes back, I assume they, having

5

said no, will now have to say yes.

6

say:

7

Miranda, we think it violates the State Constitution?

Oh, and by the way, even though it doesn't violate

8

10

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

Court mandates -JUSTICE SCALIA:

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

Can they go on and

Well, but that --- if they provide more

protections.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that wasn't the

15

question asked of them.

The only question asked of them

16

was whether it complied with Miranda.

17

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Right.

And they --

That's really not --

19

that's really not quite accurate, because they used the

20

term "Miranda warnings" generically --

21

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Generically, and --- as opposed to a

23

category of warnings which are required by both the

24

Federal Constitution and the State constitution, and

25

they said it violated the State constitution.

50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

Yes, they did.

And they

2

did -- they did say we have our standard under Traylor,

3

that we defined the right to the presence of counsel or

4

to the help of counsel as requiring presence during, as

5

--

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, except the words

7

that it quoted from the lower court opinion -- that is,

8

we are talking about the -- the Fifth Amendment, and by

9

extension, Article I, section 9.

10

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, if -- if -That's not in the question

So that seems to me to

indicate that it’s incorporating, not going further.

13

15

Right.

No.

No, that's not in

the question.
But there is a way to -- you know, they

repeated all along the way, Article I, section 9.

passing.

are the same.
MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

3

Well -- and, again, I

4

would say that they -- they agree that we are traveling

5

along the same road, but they have -- they have -- they

6

are stressing the fact that they have set a line in the

7

sand as far as what they're interpreting the right to

8

presence --

9
10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think -Well, the question asked:

11

Does the failure to provide express advice of the right

12

to the presence of counsel during questioning vitiate

13

Miranda warnings?

14

Okay?

That's the question.

They have a

15

footnote after Miranda, which reads, “Miranda v.

16

Arizona, 384 U.S. 436.”

17

question is whether this warning violated Miranda.

18

I take that to mean that the

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

And, of course, if they

19

did violate the baseline, the minimum standard set forth

20

in Miranda --

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

23

Right.
-- then it would be

unconstitutional.

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

Absolutely.
So -- which is why

52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Traylor and the Florida constitution kept making --

2

because they didn't have to really get to what the

3

bottom or the baseline or the minimum standard was, as

4

long as Florida had set forth a standard.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's true, but --

6

but if they -- if they felt the authority to go beyond

7

Miranda, wouldn't they have had to say no to this

8

question, if we find that way, and then go on to say:

9

But it does violate our own?

And that's beyond the

10

question that they -- that they -- that was certified to

11

them.
MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

12

And I believe the idea

13

that they didn't think it was deviating from the Miranda

14

case.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

Right.

I --

But if this Court finds

17

that it does, then they -- they will probably -- and I

18

feel confident that they would fall back on the

19

constitution -- of the Florida constitution.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But they did say over and

21

over again -- one was the certified question; another

22

was the issue before the court is whether the failure

23

to provide express advice of the right to the presence

24

of counsel during custodial interrogation violates the

25

principles espoused in Miranda, with the citation.

53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I mean, they said many, many times that the

2

question was -- what did Miranda mean was the issue, not

3

what -- what did Florida's extension of Miranda.

4

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

Well, they do have a

5

section in looking at, you know, other circuit courts in

6

the Federal system, and all -- what our Florida courts

7

are doing, and -- which is when they get into the

8

concept of -- well, they start out talking about Traylor

9

and our constitution at the beginning, and they -- they

10

repeat it at the end because they believe it is

11

consistent with.

They believe it is following along.

But they never say that -- that our

12
13

constitution isn't insignificant or that it's not

14

important.

15

need to cite Traylor.

If they did, they wouldn't have felt the

that it was clear -- you know, whether or not Mr. Powell

was clearly informed.

9

So no matter which standard you use, as far

10

as functionally equivalent or whatever, I believe that

11

this falls within the four corners of that.
The obligation -- let's see, I'm looking to

12
13

see what other cases -- general cases.
They -- the opposition cites to the

14
15

fact that there’s this great conflict going on among the

16

circuits.

17

whatever those cases were deciding, I don't believe they

18

would have approved of this language.

19

I don't believe that such a conflict is –-

This language, because of the "before"

20

limiting language and excluding the "presence during"

21

language, became misleading.

22

cases that like -- just the plain language, you have the

23

right to the presence of counsel, they -- they are not

24

inconsistent with -- with what Florida has required.

25

They -- they would not disagree that there --

And the -- the general

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, you said that the

2

average person wouldn't take this warning to mean --

3

to -- wouldn't envision a procedure like the grand jury

4

procedure.

5

think?

6

What does it mislead the average person to

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

That he -- that once

7

questioning starts, that he -- he has no right to

8

consult with a lawyer anymore, and it certainly

9

doesn't -- and tell him that he has the right to the

10

presence of an attorney with him in an interrogation

11

room, where the coercion takes on a highly new meaning.
I mean the coercive practices that are --

12
13
14

that are -JUSTICE ALITO:

But the latter part of that

15

is the grand jury question.

16

an attorney, but you don't have the right to have an

17

attorney present.

18

You have a right to consult

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

I don't -- I don't

19

believe -- any -- any of the normal reasonable suspects

20

are -- would probably be even aware of what the grand

21

jury proceeding was about.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

So then your argument

23

is that this -- that what -- what a normal -- an average

24

person would take this to mean is that you -- you can

25

talk an -- to an attorney before starting to answer

56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

questions, but not once the questioning begins.

2

what you take it to mean?
MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

3

That's

Correct, and I'm not the

4

only one.

5

majority on the second -- the majority of the second

6

district judges in Powell and seven judges on the second

7

district level, who all found that to be the case, and

8

we’re talking someone who doesn't have that level of

9

intelligence.

There were five supreme court justices, a

And he may have had a prior record -- he did
have a prior record, but that doesn't mean -JUSTICE ALITO:

12

Well, all of those people

13

are lawyers, and lawyers are known to read legal

14

documents very precisely.

15

them very differently.
MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

Sometimes, a little

knowledge is a dangerous thing.

20

(Laughter.)

21

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

22

And I do believe that, if this Court were to

Yes.

23

reverse, that would set a new floor for these forms and

24

that there would be the danger of the fact that -- I

25

mean, if -- if the Tampa public -- police department is

57

1

always changing its forms -- which they have shown to be

2

the case -- they have changed these forms in the past --

3

why wouldn't other agencies decide to change their forms

4

and make things more --

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You -- you think

6

it's a good thing, though, that they changed their forms

7

to track the FBI form after -- after this litigation

8

started.

9

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:

I -- I -- yes.

I do

10

believe that, when they changed the form to comply with

11

the decision below and with what's going on in 97

12

percent -- or 96 percent of the jurisdictions -- it

13

doesn't have to be exact language; it just has to be

14

there.

15

beautifully.

16

Then -- then the -- then the system runs

I can't tell you the last time I had a

17

Miranda warning case, and I have been doing this for

18

almost 30 years.

There is no litigation when it's done
correctly, and it's mostly done correctly.

Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH W. JACQUOT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. JACQUOT:

Mr. Chief Justice, let me make

2

three brief points, after responding to a question that

3

Justice Stevens asked.

4

In terms of independent and adequate State

5

grounds, in our brief, we relied on the Florida court

6

citing Miranda, the case, not Miranda, as the

7

phraseology, that the Florida Supreme Court interwove

8

the Federal law based on Miranda, the case itself, and

9

there is no plain statement to the otherwise.

10

Three quick points:

There is no

11

manipulation behind this warning.

This warning is the

12

result of litigation in Thompson v. State.

13

1991 decision by the Florida Supreme Court.

That was a

The -- the Tampa police had changed its

14
15

warning.

16

warning is simpler, with 79 words.

The previous warning

17

had arcane and redundant language.

This language is

18

more straightforward.

19

The previous warning had 148 words.

This

Those are the reasons behind the change in

20

the warning, not any kind of inference, as amici makes,

21

towards manipulation.

22
23

Second, what Respondent is asking for is
exactly what this Court chose not to do in Prysock.

24

It told the --

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
