CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

this morning in Case 12­9012, Robers v. United States.

Mr. Green.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY T. GREEN

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GREEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
With respect to property crimes, Section

11

3663A of the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act requires

12

an offset against a restitution order when any part of

13

the property is returned to the victim.

14

concerns secured loans for the purchase of real estate.

15

Pursuant to those loans, the lenders took a property

16

interest in the subject real estate, namely, the right

17

to foreclose and take title in the event of default.

18

When the lenders foreclosed and took title, that

19

represented a fully realized return of their preexisting

20

property right.

21

This case

Section 3663A further requires that that

22

property be valued as of the date of its return and not

23

at some later date when the lender sells to a third

24

party.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

When you said fully

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

returned, it wouldn't be fully returned if the debt was

2

greater than the value of the property.

3

MR. GREEN:

The property would be fully

4

returned and the property right that ­­ that is the ­­

5

the right to foreclose is returned upon the default,

6

Your Honor.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, let me just make it

8

clear.

9

loan ­­ fraudulently obtained loan, and the property is

If ­­ if the loan is for $300,000, fraudulent

10

foreclosed upon, and it's worth at the time $200,000, is

11

it your position that the property's been fully returned

12

and that there is no liability for the difference?

13
14

MR. GREEN:

No.

No, Justice Kennedy, that's

not our position.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

MR. GREEN:

Okay.
Our position is only that the

17

property has to be valued at the time that the

18

foreclosure or sheriff's auction takes place because

19

that ­­

21
22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And one more ­­ one more

question.
Under Wisconsin law, when there's a

23

foreclosure, is there some automatic valuation ordered

24

by the court or is there an appraiser that automatically

25

is ­­ is appointed or do we just decide value based on

4

the bids at the ultimate sheriff's sale?

2
3

MR. GREEN:

There is ­­ there is not any

required appraisal, Your Honor.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

MR. GREEN:

Okay.
But frequently, our

6

understanding is that lenders who credit bid for those

7

properties will, in fact, conduct an appraisal because

8

they want to know how much they should credit bid for

9

the property.

Whether it's ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, I have two

related questions.

12

The first is, what your client got was

17

wants him to pay it.

18

19

impracticality comes in.

20

He can pay it on a

So I don't know why we're in

Answer that.

But then, secondly, it's not clear to me

21

that we're thinking about this right.

22

no dispute that a loss to the victim is the amount that

23

the victim is spending to sell the property and recoup

24

the money, and you don't seem to be taking issue with

25

that.

5
Alderson Reporting Company

There seems to be

MR. GREEN:

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No.
And 36 ­­ 3663(2)

appears to be the return of the property at sentencing

4

or sometime thereafter.

5

MR. GREEN:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's right.
So it doesn't seem to be

7

controlling earlier return of property, and yet we're

8

sort of stuck in that model that somehow it has to be an

9

either/or.

The earlier date of return or on the date of

10

sentencing.

But shouldn't it be ­­ and this follows up

11

on Justice Kennedy's question ­­ shouldn't it be at the

12

time the investor can reasonably secure something from

13

the return of that property, the date of sale?

14

If we're letting them recoup the expenses of

15

sale, why don't we just simply recognize the value on

16

that date?

17

inadequately decides to hold on to it or ­­ or with no

18

reasonableness holds on to it or gives it away to their

19

mother or sells it to somebody for a nominal fee, then

20

it should be the date at which they got rid of it or the

21

day ­­ or the value of the date ­­ on the date of return

22

or something like that, or the date that they should

23

have done something with the property.

5

that's because of the risks and ­­ and maybe the

lot more on the date of sentencing, then defense counsel

11

might be able to come in and say to ­­ to the court,

12

look, the foreclosure amount was X.

Shortly thereafter,

13

the property got sold for twice X.

That indicates, Your

14

Honor, that the value as of the date of foreclosure

15

might actually have been higher, and Your Honor should

16

use, instead of the credit bid amount that the debtor

17

paid for the property, a higher amount.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, how do you arrive

at the foreclosure amount?

We would say potentially not,

The point is we don't know, and the point

14
Alderson Reporting Company

1

is Mr. Robers can't foresee it.

2

to causation issues, I wanted to address Justice

3

Breyer's point about the bat, because the Government's

4

theory of the interpretation of 3663A doesn't allow for

5

that.

6

Money is money is money.

That's what they ­­ that's

7

what they keep repeating.

They do not allow for a

8

situation in which a defendant, prior to sentencing,

9

offers up some good or property ­­

10

But before we go there

Their theory is it has to be strict identity.

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, it doesn't, you just

11

say ­­ look, "in the case of an offense resulting in the

12

loss of property."

13

that's this case.

14

$100,000, okay?

15

the judge says, defendant, return 100.

16

My poor victim lost $100,000.

So

Return the property, i.e., return the
That's simple.

100 is impossible, say because he's broke, then what are

18

you supposed to do?

19

of the property, which is 100,000 on the date of loss or

20

pay the 100,000 on the date of sentencing.

21

I'm sorry.

22

100,000, then what you have to do is pay the 100,000 or

23

pay the 100,000.

Then pay the greater of the value

That makes no sense.

Now, wait.

If you can't pay the

I'm sorry.

24

That's why I say that reading it that way to

25

me doesn't make much sense, and therefore, I think this

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is a case of A; it is a case where he's simply ordered

2

return the 100,000, and there is implicit in that you

don't have to return more than she ­­ than you took, and

4

you already gave her the bat.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, Mr. Green, here's one

2

way of looking at this case.

3

is the wrong way of looking at it.

4

that the bank sells the ­­ the property within a

5

reasonable period of time or as quickly as one could

6

reasonably expect.

7

which party bears the risk that there is going to be a

8

significant deterioration in the real estate market

9

between the time of foreclosure and the time of sale?

10

Maybe you'll tell me this

So one way of looking at this is

Now, your answer to that is that the ­­ that

11

the victim should bear that risk?

12

Why would Congress want that?

13

But let's assume

MR. GREEN:

Why should that be?

Because the victim had complete

14

control and dominion over the property once the victim

15

foreclosed on the property.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

But real estate isn't

17

completely liquid, and so it takes some time to sell it.

18

So between the time when the foreclosure occurs and the

19

time when the victim is able to sell the property and

20

get money, there ­­ there is a deterioration in the real

21

estate market.

22

MR. GREEN:

Why should the victim bear that risk?
Because the victim has complete

23

dominion and control, Your Honor.

24

wouldn't say, for example, even under the Government's

25

theory, if it were a baseball card collection and

18
Alderson Reporting Company

And ­­ and we

Official

1

somebody had returned part of the baseball card

2

collection, we wouldn't say that the ­­ that the

3

defendant is responsible for what the ­­ the owner of

4

the baseball card collection does with it after it gets

5

returned by the victim ­­ or by the defendant.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's a completely

7

formalistic answer.

8

what the person who perpetrated the fraud returns is a

9

truckload of tomatoes.

Suppose that the ­­ what the ­­

Very valuable.

It's worth

MR. GREEN:

Well, frequently, the ­­ the

2

issue is, why should a fraudfeasor actually get the

3

benefit of ­­ of a decline in the real estate market,

4

and the answer is because it's not ­­ the fraudfeasor

5

doesn't proximately cause what third parties do with a

6

part of the property that the fraudfeasor returns once

7

the fraudfeasor has returned that property.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you agree that if the

real property is returned and that everybody agrees that

10

on the day the property is returned, the value is less

11

than the loan amount, that the victim is entitled to the

12

difference between that value and the loan amount?

13

MR. GREEN:

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes, we do.
Then we are under B and

15

then we are talking about money and not the mortgaged

16

property.

18
19

MR. GREEN:

Well, we're still talking about

property, because as I said at the outset ­­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Money is property.

We're

20

still talking about the value of the loan valued in

21

terms of money and not of the real property, right?

22

Otherwise, your concession that the victim is entitled

23

to the difference can't work.

24

MR. GREEN:

Well, it would work, Your Honor,

because we do have to put a monetary value on the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The victim is entitled to

5

of the property at the time that it's returned, correct?

Thank you, Counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. HARRINGTON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
I'd like to start with what I think at least

19

is some common ground between the Government and

20

Mr. Robers.

21

fraudulently deprives a victim of a car and then gives

22

the victim a crate of pineapples or tomatoes or an

23

elephant, he's not entitled to an offset, because what

24

the victim lost was a car and the car is not the same as

25

pineapples or an elephant.

And that is that if a defendant

3

same.

What the victims lost in this case was

What they got back was houses, which is not the

4

Now, Petitioner says it is the same.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What happens if they

6

decide to give the house to ­­ the banker, to his mother

7

or grandmother?

8
9
10
11

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, then that would ­­

that would bring in the principles of proximate cause
under the MVRA.

So if I can just say ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, no, it doesn't bring

12

into principles.

13

property that had a value at some point ­­

You ­­ you have to give ­­ they took a

14

MS. HARRINGTON:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They ­­
­­ perhaps through the

16

entire period.

17

determine the value of that house?

18

What date does the judge use to

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, so, in that case,

19

Justice Sotomayor, no part of the property that was lost

20

by the lenders would have been returned to the lenders.

21

And so instead there would be some other property that

22

was returned, which is the houses, and then they would

23

have made an independent choice, which is not the choice

24

that the vast, vast majority of banks make, to do

25

something other ­­ to do something with the house other

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

than to sell it.

2

And so in that case, the district court

3

would have to use its discretion to value what had come

4

back to the lenders.

5

to do it would be to value it at the time that they

6

disposed of it.

And ­­ and probably the best way

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

MS. HARRINGTON:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So you ­­
But that's not ­­
You're ­­ you're ­­ yes,

10

the judge would use his or her discretion and decide

11

what would have been a reasonable value at that ­­ of

12

that house at a time when the lender should have sold

13

it.

14

MS. HARRINGTON:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But ­­
Not when they received

16

it, not when the sentencing happened, not after the

17

sentencing.

18

MS. HARRINGTON:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Right.
But on the day the court

20

decides whether a reasonable investor who's taken back

21

the property should have converted it to cash.

22

MS. HARRINGTON:

But I think it's very

23

important to note that that situation would not fall

24

under 3663A(b)(1)(B)(ii).

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, it's under ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

Exactly.

different thing.
MS. HARRINGTON:

Right.

That's a different

5

thing, because no part of the property that was lost in

6

that situation was returned.

7
8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's ­­ that's my

point exactly.
MS. HARRINGTON:

Right.

But what we're

10

talking about here is that ­­ is a situation in which

11

some part of the property that was lost was returned to

12

the victim.

13

property that was returned to the victim?

14

part of the money that they lost.

15

was the house.

16

houses.

17

they had ­­ they had no interest in having the houses.

18

And so when they got the houses back, no part of the

19

property was returned to them.

20

was returned to ­­

And the question is:

We say it was

Mr. Robers says it

But the victims didn't ever own the

They never intended to own the houses.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

They ­­

No part of the property

Ms. Harrington, your whole

argument really rests on that statutory language.

23

MS. HARRINGTON:

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

Well, what was the

Yes.
And one of the questions

that came up in the last half hour is, is that the right

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

section of the statute.

2

that the only thing involved here is money, that's all

3

that's involved here, why aren't we under A, rather than

4

B?

5
6
7

Now, in your view, which is

MS. HARRINGTON:

Because Mr. Robers doesn't

have the money that he took from the victim, and so ­­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.

But usually when you

8

don't have money, I mean, say ­­ let's just say I'm a

9

fraud victim, and I get an order of restitution for

10

$100,000, and the fraudster doesn't have the $100,000.

11

He only has $50,000.

12

So the court says:

Well, now you have to

13

pay the $50,000 and we're going to put you on a schedule

14

of payments, and you are going to pay the other 50 over

15

the next year or two years, whatever.

16

MS. HARRINGTON:

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

18
19

Yes.
Would you think that that's

under B?
MS. HARRINGTON:

So our view is that 3663A

20

governs the calculation of the loss to the victims, and

21

3664 governs how the defendant pays back a restitution

22

award.

23

is that the court would order the defendant to return

24

the part of the property he took that he still has, the

25

$50,000, and then under 3664A, he would put him on a

And so in your hypothetical, what would happen

28
Alderson Reporting Company

payment schedule to pay back the rest.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So you think that my

3

hypothetical ­­ let me ­­ I'm just ­­ I'm sorry for ­­

4

is under B, not under A?

5
6

MS. HARRINGTON:
yes.

7

I do think it's under B,

I don't mean to ­­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

So any time I don't have

8

enough money to make the victim whole, it's under B, not

9

A?

10

MS. HARRINGTON:

Yes.

And you would get an

11

offset for the amount of the money that you returned to

12

the lender.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I don't ­­ I guess ­­

14

gosh, I don't know.

15

it was under A for pretty much the same reason that

16

Justice Breyer said.

17

to be under B.

18

know, if ­­ if ­­ if return of the cash is impossible,

19

pay the cash under B.

20

that's not a sensible statutory command.

21

But I would have just thought that

It just doesn't make sense for it

I mean, essentially you are saying, you

That ­­ that just doesn't ­­

MS. HARRINGTON:

It ­­ well, it does make

22

sense if you ­­ if you remember that 3663A is about the

23

calculation of the loss at the time of sentencing.

24

so it's not about, you know, how ­­ how much of a loss

25

you are going to have once the restitution order has

29
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

been paid off, because at that point, the victim will

2

have no loss.

3

They will have been paid.

What you are trying to calculate is what was

4

the loss that we're ­­ that we're going to order the

5

restitution for.

6

defendant ­­ defendant still has part of the property

7

that he took, then the court says:

JUSTICE BREYER:

If the

MS. HARRINGTON:

If you want to

What I'm saying is that the

18

property that was lost is the property that was lost.

19

If the property that was lost is a crate of tomatoes and

you don't have it, and you can't give it back, something

that ­­ once under 3664, the district court structures

20

the way you pay a restitution order, that ultimately you

21

will be paying $100 a month for 182 years, which is what

22

this guy is going to be doing, which is to say that

23

money is never going to get back to the lenders.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If

It doesn't matter

Well, what do you think

happens in an A case where let's ­­ let's ­­ in a

32
Alderson Reporting Company

mortgage case, so there's a home, but this ­­ this

2

person also has cash and repays the full amount in cash.

3

And now the bank has the full amount in cash, but also

4

has this home.

5

is the defendant entitled to an offset?

6

And then the bank sells the home.

MS. HARRINGTON:

Is ­­

The defendant is entitled.

7

If the ­­ if the defendant pays back the full amount of

8

the cash that it took and the lenders have taken title

9

to the house, then the lenders have no loss because the

10

full amount of the property has been returned to the

11

defendant.

12
13

Under our view ­­ and let me just say, this
situation really never arises.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I know.

But if it did

15

arise, because I'm trying to figure out ­­ it seems to

16

me that there has to be an implicit offset in A as well.

17

MS. HARRINGTON:

So, no, I think the way

18

that would ­­ I think it would come in under 3664.

19

under 3664, district courts have discretion to fashion a

20

restitution order that fits the circumstances of the

21

case.

JUSTICE ALITO:

And

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Fine.

It seemed redundant, not

22

MS. HARRINGTON:

I don't ­­ I don't ­­

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

The same problem is there.

24

You go to 3664, and what happened was it says in 3664:

25

Enter a restitution order, judge.

34
Alderson Reporting Company

And when you do that,

Official

1

provide for a lump­sum payment or partial payments or at

2

specified intervals, in­kind payments, a combination of

3

payments.

4

It gives a judge a lot of discretion.

So I imagine the judge, if he'd already

5

given her back 20,000, would say:

6

her $80,000 more.

Now, defendant, pay

7

MS. HARRINGTON:

Yes.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, the problem here is,

9

instead of giving her the $20,000, he gave her an

10

in­kind payment.

11

in this case a house.

12

MS. HARRINGTON:

Right.

20

point out, and the judge could ­­ what happens if she

21

won't sell the house?

22

the house, I'm not selling.

Since that's so, I would have thought ­­ you have a

That's the end

Unless, of course, it was an unreasonable,

She says:

I love the bat, I love

JUSTICE BREYER:

­­ or you ­­ or let it

35
Alderson Reporting Company

befall on you what help befalls.

2

to do is value the house if she still won't sell it.

And then what you have

3

MS. HARRINGTON:

Yes, he would ­­

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

And you have to value the

5
6

bat if she still won't sell it.
MS. HARRINGTON:

Do I have that right?

Yes, but you would value

7

the bat or the house as a replacement of property under

8

Subsection 3664(f)(4), not as a return of the property

9

that was lost.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

It was not a return.

11

MS. HARRINGTON:

Right, because it's not the

12

property ­­

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

they're try to get rid of.

15

MS. HARRINGTON:

Right, but ­­

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

I see.

17

MS. HARRINGTON:

But under Section 3664, you

It's in­kind property

18

are allowed to make an in­kind payment with return of

19

property or replacement of property.

20

is return of the property that was lost; replacement is

21

giving some other kind of property different from what

22

was lost.

23

Return of property

But under Section ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

easy if the property is returned on the date of

Alderson Reporting Company

It's

2

Because then the judge could basically figure out what's

3

a reasonable time, the date of sentence or within the 90

4

days, the day they sold the property.

5
6

MS. HARRINGTON:

It's easy when they sell

­­ which is part of the

property they lost.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But ­­ but the question

11

becomes what happens when the house is done before ­­

given over not as a part of sentencing, but

13

independently.

14

MS. HARRINGTON:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So the next thing ­­

16

why I don't think any of these provisions really answer

that question.

MS. HARRINGTON:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But ­­
And so why don't we go

20

back to the basics?

21

you agree with this ­­ why should the victim suffer the

22

loss attendant to selling property that decreases in

23

value because during the time that they were teeing it

24

up for sale, the market dropped, and you say the victim

25

shouldn't.

Why should the victim ­­ I think

MS. HARRINGTON:

What's the value

It's the date that

It's ­­ right, but that's

because that's when they got back part of the property

10

they lost, because the property they lost was money.

11

When they got the house, no part of the property that

12

they lost was returned to them until they got the money

13

back.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now, Justice Breyer

asked you what happens if on some day, they did

something unreasonable.

They gave it to a grandmother.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

involved in the fraudulent acquisition of ­­ of many,

14

many more houses than these two houses.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So that ­­ but did

jointly and severally liable for the losses from these

21

two houses.

23

Mr. Robers asked the court to do that; the court decided

24

not to do that; he hasn't appealed that part of the

25

decision to this Court, and so that's sort of dropped

Now, the Section 3664(h) allows a district

But that is an option under the MVRA.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think I understand now

3

better than I did what his argument is.

4

you want to go from A, because there are all kinds of

5

property that could be taken, not just money.

I see now why

6

MS. HARRINGTON:

Right.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

And they say now A is out

8

of it because he wasn't able to return it, so we're in

9

B.

And I was saying well, B requires the same thing;

10

and you say that's right.

11

you say but that's how it works for other property,

12

anyway.

13

So what's the point?

Well,

Now, when we get to B, we get that last

14

phrase, and they want to make like doubly sure that ­­

15

that if in fact some of the property had already been

16

gone back, it's going to count; and he's saying, well,

it did go back.

And then what do we do?

And the answer is

Now, have I got that

Alderson Reporting Company

1

right?

2

MS. HARRINGTON:

You've gotten that right.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Thank you.

4

MS. HARRINGTON:

And I just want to add the

5

element that the reason that you do that is when the

6

house goes back to the victim, no part of the property

7

they lost has been returned to them.

8

important to recognize that in almost all of these

9

mortgage fraud cases, the bank forecloses on the

10
11
12

property long before sentencing.
JUSTICE BREYER:

And I think it's

In this case ­­

Oh, I'm not sure you'd say

no part of the property they lost has been returned.

13

MS. HARRINGTON:

When they get ­­

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

What's been happening is

15
16
17

they've got some in­kind return.
MS. HARRINGTON:

They've gotten different

property.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's true.

19

MS. HARRINGTON:

But under Section 3663, it

20

uses the phrase "the property" after it has declared

21

that the property is the property that was lost.

22

when you get a house back and you've lost money, no part

23

of the property you've lost has been returned.

24
25

And so

And, again, if I can just say that in these
mortgage fraud cases, the banks have foreclosed and sold

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the houses generally long before sentencing; in this

2

case, even before the defendant was charged with any

3

crime.

4

restitution when they're taking title to the houses and

5

selling them.

6

these houses into money, because that's what we lost,

7

and we want to maximize our return on the houses.

8
9

And banks ­­ so banks aren't thinking about

What they're thinking is, we want to turn

And they're not thinking of restitution as
some sort of insurance against their needing to be

10

responsible in selling the houses, because as in this

11

case, most defendants don't have the resources to pay a

12

restitution award.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

And when they sell and they

14

get much more money than they otherwise thought from the

15

house, that extra amount also counts, then, in the

16

defendant's favor?

17

MS. HARRINGTON:

Absolutely.

Under our

18

view, the defendant gets the benefit of that, and the

19

victim would not be overcompensated.

20

wouldn't get any benefit of that and the victim would

21

get double recovery.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23

get the benefit of that?

24

to go get the excess?

25

MS. HARRINGTON:

Under his view, he

Well, how does the defendant
What would the defendants do

Well, again, usually the

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

house has sold long before sentencing.

2

value of the property has gone up between the time of

3

foreclosure and the time of the subsequent sale, then

4

the offset amount is, again, the amount that the bank

5

gets when they sell the house.

6

an amount larger than the value of the house at the

7

foreclosure and the defendant gets a larger offset.

8
9

12

And so that's ­­ that's

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You would agree

that ­­

10
11

And so if the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Over the ­­ the total amount

lost?
MS. HARRINGTON:

If it's over the total

13

amount lost, then the victim's loss is zero as a result

14

of the defendant's fraud, and so he doesn't have to pay

15

any restitution award.

16

keep the extra amount of the money in the same way that

17

happens in any foreclosure proceeding when there's no

18

fraud involved.

19

Now, the victim would get to

If a bank forecloses ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You would ­­ you

20

would ­­ you would agree that a different rule applies

21

if there is some unreasonable delay in disposing of the

22

property?

23

MS. HARRINGTON:

Yes.

And in our view,

24

that's a proximate cause question, because then the

25

victim's net losses wouldn't be caused by the

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

defendant's fraud.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And what do you do

3

in the case of some dramatic development between the

4

return of the house as opposed to the ­­ the property

5

and its ­­ and its sale?

6
7
8
9

MS. HARRINGTON:

It depends what sort of

dramatic development you mean.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you know,

something is discovered with respect to the property

10

that nobody knew about.

11

hazardous chemical zone and the property is ­­ is

12

worthless.

13

I don't mean to prejudge the case.

It's ­­ suddenly, it's a

While when it was returned ­­ not returned;

14

MS. HARRINGTON:

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The bank got it.
When the bank got

16

it, it was worth $200,000, but all of a sudden it's, you

17

know, Love Canal or something, and it's worth nothing.

18

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, it's not our view ­­

19

you know, the house is only worth what someone is

20

willing to pay for it in an arm's­length transaction.

21

And so if there's something about the house that you

22

just didn't know when the bank got the house, then that

23

really wouldn't be the value of the house.

24

the house is what you can sell it for, and if there's

25

something that's ­­

45
Alderson Reporting Company

The value of

Official

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, no.

But my

2

point is, is it the value you could sell it for before

3

this discovery of an extraordinary condition, or is it

4

the value afterward?

5

MS. HARRINGTON:

I think in that case, it

6

would probably be whatever the money that the bank can

7

get for the house.

8

of event, like if ­­ you know, if there's an earthquake

9

in the middle of the country that destroys the house,

10

then I think that would be ­­ that would be sort of a

11

classic example of something that would break the chain

12

of proximate cause.

13

But if there's some other type of ­­

And so what would happen in that case

14

usually is the bank would get paid by its insurance

15

company, compensated for the loss of the house, and you

16

would sort of value the house at the time that it was ­­

17

it was destroyed after the bank acquired it.

18

the insurance company in that case wouldn't be entitled

19

to any restitution from the defendant, because it

20

wouldn't be the defendant's actions that caused the

21

destruction of the house.

22

And then

What he's saying is that just the fact that

23

the ­­ that the housing market went down is an

24

intervening nonforeseeable event that breaks the chain

25

of causation.

Under our view, that's absolutely not

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

correct.

2

injected the health of the housing market into the

3

ultimate determination of the victim's net losses.

4

­­ his design was that he would take money from the

5

banks and promise to pay it back.

6

to pay it back, in fact never made a single payment.

7

That necessarily and foreseeably triggered the

8

foreclosure, which caused the banks to own the houses

9

and then caused them to put them on the market and sell.

10

The very nature of the defendant's scheme

He

He had no intention

It's absolutely foreseeable that it takes

11

banks a certain amount of time to sell the houses,

12

absolutely foreseeable that the value of the houses will

13

fluctuate over time.

14

what the houses would have been worth on a particular

15

date in the future to be able to say that it was

16

foreseeable that the value would change.

17

No one has to be able to predict

And the MVRA allocates any risk from a

18

change in property to a defendant, not to the victim.

19

And that's consistent with our view.

20

If there are no further questions, I can

21

rest ­­ I guess I would just like to end by reiterating

22

our main point, which is that the text of the statute is

23

very clear in this case, and what it focuses on is how

24

much of the property that was lost has been returned to

25

the victim before sentencing.

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

When the property that was lost was a car,

2

you don't get an offset for returning pineapples.

3

the property that was lost was money, you don't get an

4

offset for returning the house.

5

almost all mortgage fraud cases, the banks were able to

6

get back some of the property they lost when they sold

7

the houses, and so there's no valuation question here.

8

It's not a question of how much of the property that was

9

lost did the banks get back.

When

But in this case, as in

10

The district court knew 100 percent for sure

11

because the houses were sold before Mr. Robers was even

12

charged with a crime.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, what if they

14

get ­­ they get the house and as soon as they get it,

15

there are ten offers at $500,000 or more, and the amount

16

of the restitution is, you know, $300,000 or whatever.

17

But the bank says, you know, I think the market is going

18

to go even higher, so I'm not going to sell it right

19

away, I'm going to wait, not an unreasonable length of

20

time, but I'm going to wait.

21

craters.

22

get what they were able to sell it for?

23

And then the market

I mean, is the same rule then, that they only

MS. HARRINGTON:

24

bank ­­ what the bank did was commercially reasonable.

25

If the bank ­­

48
Alderson Reporting Company

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I know banks like to

2

get rid of property as soon as possible, but, you know,

3

they make decisions at some point, let's wait before we

4

sell this.

5

Is that commercially reasonable?

MS. HARRINGTON:

I mean, it's hard to know.

6

You know, you wouldn't want to ­­ we wouldn't want to

7

judge that with 100 percent perfect hindsight, right?

8

You'd want to say ­­ if you were in the bank's shoes at

9

the time it made the decision, was that a commercially

10

reasonable decision, and you know, that's a decision

11

that would have to be made in those kind of cases.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, why should the

13

defendant here subsidize the banks playing the market?

14

That's what you are saying.

15

MS. HARRINGTON:

No, what I'm saying is ­­

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The bank is playing the

17

market.

18

now, but, yeah, it may go up.

19

you know, he's paying for the bank's roll of the dice.

20

It says, yeah, we could sell it for so much

MS. HARRINGTON:

And you're saying that,

So if there really ­­ if

21

there really is evidence that the bank is sort of really

22

rolling the dice, then that might be a harder question.

23

Generally, what the bank wants is to turn the house into

24

money because the bank is not in the business of owning

25

houses.

It's in the business of having money.

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And again, the banks don't have in their

2

mind that they're going to get a restitution payment

3

when they take the houses.

4

that they're going to take a loss.

5

foreclose on a house, it's a bad mortgage, generally

6

they are going to get back less for the house than what

7

they got for the mortgage, and if that happens they

8

consider it a loss, and I think any business person

9

would consider that a loss.

10

What they have in mind is
If they've had to

And it's perfectly foreseeable that it's

11

going to take the bank a certain amount of time to turn

12

the house into cash.

13

sentencing, it's really an easy case to apply Section

14

3663A because you absolutely know for sure how much of

15

the lost property has been returned to the victim and

16

it's the amount of the money they got for the sale, or

17

for the property.

18

But when that's happened before

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But if I could just be clear

19

about what you're saying, you're saying it's not the

20

sale price when the sale is for a nominal amount; is

21

that right?

22

MS. HARRINGTON:

23

unreasonable?

And so if that's right and

5

both of those things sound right, but why doesn't that

6

kind of explode your statutory argument, because then

7

it's not any part of the property that's returned.

8
9

MS. HARRINGTON:

Because the other parts of

JUSTICE BREYER:

You're saying because

the housing market goes up, and so more often than not

MS. HARRINGTON:

the other formulation, wouldn't you?

Yes, and I think there is a

presumption that banks are going to act in a

16

commercially reasonable way because they have no

17

expectation of getting any money back through the

18

restitution process.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If the sale ­­ if at the

20

time of sentencing, the house has not yet been sold, but

21

there's no ­­ there's good reason for the delay, because

22

for example, there are no bids at an earlier time, could

23

the judge defer the restitution order until the house is

24

sold?

25

MS. HARRINGTON:

So as Justice Breyer

55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

suggested, under our view, the court ­­ the district

2

court's first resort would be to say ­­ to push off the

3

determination of the restitution amount for 90 days

4

under 3664(d)(5), and give the ­­ give the bank a little

5

more time to sell the house, because in that case, a

6

determination ­­ you wouldn't be able to ascertain the

7

net losses of the victim.

8

If ­­ if a bank still couldn't sell the

9

house, then I think under this Court's decision in

10

Dolan, what the court could do is say:

11

to order restitution; the restitution will be for the

12

full amount of the mortgages, the money that was lost

13

minus whatever amount of money the banks get back when

14

they sell the houses.

15

Yes, I'm going

And if the bank has not been able to sell

16

the house at that point, it's really to everyone's

17

benefit to give them the chance to do it, because if no

18

one wants to buy the house and you force the district

19

court to value the house at that point, it's going to

20

give it a really low value and that doesn't help the

21

defendant, it doesn't really help the bank ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What does the defendant

do if they act unreasonably after that order?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY T. GREEN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GREEN:

It's important, Justice

12

Sotomayor and Justice Kennedy, to understand that

13

defendants have no compulsory process in this

14

restitution­ordering scheme.

15

So that if there is a delay, Justice

16

Ginsburg, in the ultimate sale of the property or maybe

17

it's for a nominal amount or maybe it's for a discounted

18

amount, the defendant has no way to try and look behind

19

that transaction.

20

can't ­­ they could call a witness, but it would only be

21

if it was a friendly witness.

22

They can't issue a subpoena.

And here, Benjamin Robers sits with a

23

$219,000 restitution order for which he is jointly and

24

severally liable, as my colleague said 182 years it

25

takes to pay off, and there is no way for his attorney,

57
Alderson Reporting Company

2

challenge them.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why not?

Why not just say,

5

6

dollar, and they only want to subtract a dollar, the

MR. GREEN:

I would

­­ an in­kind payment, and

11

they were wrong to sell it.

And it was worth 100,000,

12

that was totally crooked, their selling it.

13

therefore, I want you to say, fine, perfectly right

14

subtract $1 under (ii) ­­ (ii), but subtract 99,000 more

15

because of the in­kind payment that was made.

16

Would you say that?

MR. GREEN:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. GREEN:

No.

And

And a ­­ and a ­­
Why?

Because, Your Honor, in an

20

obvious case like that, the defendant would have the

21

ability to ­­ to point to the facts and circumstances

22

and say, you know, that ­­ that, it doesn't appear, to

23

be an arm's­length transaction, Your Honor, and that

24

would be obvious evidence.

25

But much more sophisticated things are going

58
Alderson Reporting Company

1

on here, Justice Breyer.

2

we take a look at the Inlet Shore Drive property, it

3

sells for $166,000, which appears to be quite a bit

4

lower than its value when the bank got ahold of that

5

property for nothing ­­ for no reason that Mr. Robers

6

had control over.

7

This is a situation where if

If that property had been burning down,

8

Justice Alito, he would not have been able to go in and

9

throw a bucket of water on it because that would have

10

been trespassing.

11

that property.

He had no dominion or control over

12

So in a situation where ­­

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but the only

14

reason he would have been trespassing is because, in

15

fact, he did not live in the house as he promised the

16

bank he would when the bank gave him the money.

17

MR. GREEN:

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

Right.
So why shouldn't he

bear the responsibility for that consequence?

20

MR. GREEN:

Because of the bank's dominion,

21

because of the situations we've been talking about here

22

where the bank holds on to the property unreasonably too

23

long, right into the teeth of a great recession ­­

fundamental one.
