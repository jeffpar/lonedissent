ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HELLMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Congress expressly prohibited what the

12

bankruptcy court did here.

13

Code, Congress specified that a debtor's exempt

14

property, his homestead, his pension, his wedding ring,

15

is not liable for the payment of, quote, "any

16

administrative expense."

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

up your ­­ your thing?

19

That's good.

20

Under Section 522(k) of the

MR. HELLMAN:

Excuse me.

Will you crank

I can't you hear well enough.

Congress, in Section 522(k),

21

specified specifically that a debtor's exempt property

22

is not liable for any administrative expense.

23

The bankruptcy court was not free to

24

override that express and specific prohibition in the

25

name of equity, a point that has been clear for at least

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

80 years, since this Court's case in Ginsberg & Sons,

2

and said Congress made the judgment that debtors and

3

their dependents, even dishonest debtors, ought not be

4

deprived of their exempt property such that they would

5

emerge from bankruptcy as wards of the State.

6

Instead, Congress authorized other serious

7

punishments for debtor misconduct.

8

punishment that the Code forbids must be addressed to

9

Congress and not the supposed equitable discretion of

the bankruptcy court.

11

Now, if I could, I'd like to ­­

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

I am somewhat taken aback by

13

your constant reference ­­ your repeated references to

14

"wards of the State."

What we're talking about is whether your

16

client gets $75,000.

MR. HELLMAN:

Do you think everybody who doesn't

This is his last $75,000, Your

Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes.

Well, do you ­­ do you

21

know what the ­­ the median net worth of a household in

22

the United States is?

23

25

MR. HELLMAN:

It's ­­ it's about ­­ I'm not

sure what the median net worth ­­

It's less than $70,000.

the question here is not whether he's going to be a ward

of the State.

above the median in his assets.

4

The question is whether he's going to be

MR. HELLMAN:

Well, I think what's going on

5

here, Your Honor, is actually a federalism principle.

6

Congress recognized, in 522, that States, in effect,

7

would be the ones who would have to take care of those

8

who do not have a home, do not have tools of trade, do

9

not have a pension.

10

And so what 522 does is it says that the

11

State authorizes you an exemption, and you claim it, and

12

it becomes exempt, then you get to keep it through the

13

bankruptcy law, because otherwise, in effect, it is the

14

State that ends up being required to house or support

15

or ­­ or help those and their dependents who are

16

deprived of, essentially, their last dollar, which is

17

what is exactly the case here.

18

Here every penny ­­ all of Mr. Law's

19

creditors in this case have been paid off.

20

has already received approximately $280,000.

21

talking about literally, literally, the last $75,000,

22

and all of it, that would be going to the trustee.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The trustee
We're just

I don't follow that,

MR. HELLMAN:

But now the ­­ the

trustee, who is obliged to try to find what assets he or

6

she can, spends a huge amount of money in order to ­­ to

7

prove that this claim of a second mortgage was false.

And ­­ and there should be ­­ so what
happens then, on your theory, that all that money was

Nobody pays the

Is that ­­

MR. HELLMAN:

Well, the first 280,000 have

14

been satisfied, and the trustee was not obligated by any

15

law to pursue the administration of the estate in a way

16

that would be cost­ineffective.

17

But our point here is that Congress had made

18

the determination ­­ we could have ­­ there could be a

19

policy discussion, of course, about whether exempt

20

property ought to be allowed to go to the administrative

21

costs of the estate or to prepetition creditors in

22

situations in which the ­­ a court finds litigation

23

misconduct.

24

But that is not the judgment Congress made.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

do any more work, the only way I'm going to get paid is

out of the $75,000.

7

I'm going to be working free.

8

What should he do?

9

MR. HELLMAN:

Suppose the trustee has a meter

I better stop because, otherwise,

Well, the trustee, in that

10

situation ­­ and the trustee handbook, pages 4­3, 4­4 of

11

the trustee handbook that the United States Office of

12

Trustee puts out, notes that administrators on the

13

estate ought to assess whether or not pursuing a claim

14

will be an effective ­­ will yield an effective return

15

for the estate.

16

And, again, Congress, made the judgment

17

that, when a debtor lies to a court, he loses his

22

And I think the Ginsberg case is quite on

23

point here because the facts of that case were striking

even today.

25

There, in Ginsberg, the debtor was a

A creditor went to the

Why?

Because the Bankruptcy Code specified the

adverted to the general equitable powers of the

13

bankruptcy court, which are codified then, as now, in

And this Court said, no, the specific

16

that the equitable provision, the general equity cannot

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Your position is that the

3

trustee can take no action to make the estate whole in

4

the event of, say, Justice Alito's type of hypothetical,

5

the bank ­­ the estate bankruptcy trustee spends

6

$125,000 in legal fees to bring property back to the

7

estate that had been concealed by wrongful conduct of

8

the debtor and the debtor still gets $75,000 of that?

9

There’s nothing the bankruptcy trustee can do to make

10
11

that bankruptcy estate whole?
MR. HELLMAN:

Of course, as was the case

12

here, there was a denial of discharge, the classic and

13

serious penalty for debtors who engage in misconduct

14

before a bankruptcy court. Now what that means in almost

15

every case is that there will be debts owed to

16

pre­petition creditors that remain unpaid.

17

It's essentially the bankruptcy death

18

penalty in the sense that it makes the debtor liable for

19

the rest of his days until those debts are paid off.

20

That's a very serious punishment.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is It? Now what about the house?

22

house was still exempt because if they levy on the

23

house, you go back to bankruptcy and it's still exempt.

24

So there's nothing you can do to make the trustee ­­ the

25

estate whole.

MR. HELLMAN:

Two points, Your Honor.

One,

2

the question to where you want to draw the line about

3

deterring debtor misconduct and leaving debtors without,

4

literally, their last dollar coming out of bankruptcy is

5

an important question, but a policy question, and one

6

where Congress has spoken with an expressed prohibition.

7

Now, there are other sanctions, not ­­ none

8

of which were levied here or sought to be levied here,

9

Rule 11 and the like, that might serve to provide an

10

additional source of funds, but not from exempt

11

property, because Congress has walled that off.

12

looks ­­

13
14

JUSTICE BREYER:

If one

The same thing is true of

certain retirement funds.

15

MR. HELLMAN:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, Your Honor.
So if, in fact, the person

17

has $4 million in this special retirement fund account

18

and he's behaved in the most extraordinarily dishonest

19

way, the trustee has no power to impose a sanction on

20

those funds, even if he'll earn a big income, he's lied

21

nonstop, etcetera.

22

MR. HELLMAN:

Congress has amended

23

Section 522 already eight times since 1978, about once

24

every 4­1/2 years, if my math is correct, to fine­tune

25

the extent to which debtors can claim exemptions.

12
Alderson Reporting Company

As

Official

1

the Court is aware, in 2005 for example, the ­­ Congress

2

limited the extent to which a debtor could claim an

3

exemption in his homestead, I suppose precisely for

4

analogous reasoning to what Your Honor suggests.

5

It's still nonetheless perfectly clear from

6

Section 522(k) that Congress has not created or allowed

7

some sort of free­floating equitable discretion for

8

bankruptcy courts to reach a different result in cases.

9

And again I would like to point the Court to Section

10

522(c) as well, which is the companion provision to the

11

administrative expenses provision.

12

As the Court, of course, is aware, debtors

13

often have debts arising from all sorts of improper

14

conduct, willful and malicious injury, criminal

15

restitution awards, fraud, embezzlement, there is a

16

whole list of these things in Section 523 and the Code

17

makes these debts non­dischargeable, inherent per se

18

non­dischargeable, meaning that when you go through

19

bankruptcy you’re not going to be able to escape paying

20

these debts once the bankruptcy is over.

21

However, in Section 522(c)(1) of the code

22

Congress picked out just two, just two of those

23

categories of debts, alimony and certain tax liability,

24

of these non­dischargeable debts that could be satisfied

25

from exempt property.

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

The debtor who has a wrongful death

2

judgment, the debtor who has a fraud judgment, the

3

debtor who has a criminal restitution award, all of

4

those debts are non­dischargeable, they stay with the

5

debtor until they're paid, but they are expressly not

6

paid from exempt property.

7

That is a quintessential policy judgment of

8

Congress's to decide where to draw the line between

9

deterring, not making bankruptcy a haven for those who

10

seek to avoid their misconduct or engage in misconduct,

11

but at the same time recognizing that taking someone's

24

Code work is that absent any sort of special award

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

debtor is not liable for his administrative expenses

2

once the bankruptcy case closes, even if there has been

3

a denial of discharge.

4

Congress has determined that, although a

5

debtor will be on the hook for the debts that he brought

6

into bankruptcy, he will not be on the hook for debts

7

arising from the administrative expenses going forward,

8

because I think Congress understood that those expenses

might be out of the debtor's control and that a debtor

ought not leave bankruptcy in a worse condition ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Hellman, (k) of

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

course talks about exempt property.

2

MR. HELLMAN:

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.
Is there a possibility of

4

reading the statute such that the exemption just never

5

comes into effect?

6

MR. HELLMAN:

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If you look at 522(l) ­­
Yes.
­­ (l) says, "unless a party

8

in interest objects, the property claimed as exempt is

9

exempt."

Now, that suggests that if the party in

10

interest does object, there's a question about whether

11

the party claimed as exempt is exempt.

12

So ­­ so why isn't it a permissible reading

13

of the statute to essentially say the court gets to

14

decide whether this is exempt property such that (k)

15

comes into effect, and in deciding whether it's exempt

16

property, it can take into account the Petitioner's

17

abuse of process?

18

MR. HELLMAN:

Two points.

Of course, no

objection was ever lodged within the time period that

20

rule ­­

22
23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

I completely agree

with that, but suppose one were.
MR. HELLMAN:

That objection ­­ that

24

objection would not be well founded because it is

25

undisputed that Petitioner is entitled to his homestead

22
Alderson Reporting Company

exemption under California law.

2

this is his home, he's lived there for the requisite

3

amount of time, he has the equity, all of that.

California law says

apply to this case either, put some limits on a debtor's

7

his homestead exemption; if money is poured into the

8

home before declaring bankruptcy, Congress cut back on

9

that a little bit.

10
11

And I suppose you could have an

objection on that basis.
But this was not a case in which the

12

Petitioner lost his exemption because he wasn't entitled

13

to it.

14

the court observes this is the exemption to which he's

15

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

To the contrary, at page 69a of the appendix,

24
25

The creditor could not have objected to the
exemption on that basis?

23
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. HELLMAN:

The objection was proper.

So

2

the answer to your question is yes, no objection ­­ no

3

objection would have been proper in that situation

4

because ­­

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

6

MR. HELLMAN:

And why is that?
Because Section 522, the way

7

it works is that the question is are you entitled to the

8

exemption under State law.

9

I believe, asks you to look at.

That's what Section 522(b),
And then there's a

10

question of is an objection going to be interposed

11

within the period provided by Section 522(l).

12

Congress, of course, is free to create other

13

limitations on a debtor's ability to claim exemptions.

14

And as I said, they have done that in Section 522(o),

15

Section 522(p), Section 522(q), which deals

16

specifically, by the way, with situations in which the

17

very filing of the bankruptcy case is a ­­ is an abuse

18

of the code.

19

And in that case, in Section 522(q),

20

Congress ultimately decided that for debtors whose

21

22

the case shows that it's an abuse of the code, Congress

23

decided in those cases that a debtor should not lose all

24

Absolutely, you're right, Justice

word about in my friend's argument on the other side,

5

MR. KATYAL:

No, because I think in order to

2

understand what the prohibition was, you have to ­­ you

3

have to look to 105(a); that is, what 105(a) does is it

4

says, in general, you have this power.

5

522(k), I think it speaks of the general case in which

6

there isn't this type of excessive bad faith, fraud on

7

the court.

8

And indeed,

And so absolutely, I think in general, just

9

as in Marrama itself, there's general language which

10

says administrative expenses normally aren't liable.

11

But in the atypical case, to use Marrama's words, a case

12

like this in which the only way the code would work and

13

functionally work is to incentivize trustees to try and

14

uncover the fraud.

Your Honor, I think that's what

7

And yet, he can keep the $75,000.

MR. KATYAL:

Why should ­­

For two reasons,

8

Justice Breyer, because Section 105(a), as well as the

9

inherent power of the Court deal with specifically this

10

type of situation, abuse of process, fraud on the Court

11

itself, not any type of prepetition conduct or anything

like that.

13

language in 522(q), which we were talking about earlier,

14

is only about that prepetition conduct.

15

It doesn't have ­­ so absolutely.

It's targeted to this.

And, of course, the

Congress

18

engaged in bad faith, fraud on the Court, whatever,

you're still entitled to your exemption.

That's not

To the contrary, and this picks up on

the creditor and, I guess, any other party could not

that?

6

MR. KATYAL:

I don't.

Do you agree with

There are other provisions in the Code which say if an

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT
MS. HARRINGTON:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

6

I'd like to start, if I could, by taking a

7

little bit of a step back to note that outside of the

8

bankruptcy system, an individual who runs up more debts

9

than they can satisfy with their collective assets has

10

no right to wipe out those debts while retaining some of

11

their property in the face of unpaid assets.

Those duties include the

Alderson Reporting Company

1

duty to turn over property to the estate, to the

2

trustee, and the duty to cooperate with the trustee

3

throughout the case.

4

Now, Mr. Law flouted all of those

5

obligations, making it impossible to carry out the

6

provisions of those parts of the Code without

7

surcharging him in some way.

8

Section 704 imposes duties on the trustee.

9

Those duties include the duty to investigate the

financial affairs of a debtor and the duty to collect

the property of the debtor, reduce it to money and give

that money to creditors.

cost on the exercise of those duties.

17

discretion to try to offset some of those costs by

18

imposing a surcharge on what would have otherwise been

19

exempt property of the debtor.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Harrington, you clearly

21

have the facts on your side.

22

you have the law.

23

Justice Breyer said, "Property that the debtor exempts

under this section is not liable for payment of any

administrative expense."

The question is whether

their exempt property used to pay administrative

But as I've said, 521 and 704 express

Congress's policy judgments about what debtors are

supposed to do and what trustees are supposed to do.

And Section 105 give ­­ gives Bankruptcy Courts

19

conduct in the litigation.

20

So that's bad

I think that is an implicit exception to

21

most of the general rules that are laid out in the

22

Bankruptcy Code.

23

In this case, it's really impossible for the

24

Court to have carried out all of the provisions of the

25

Code, but that's directly because of the debtor's

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

behavior in this case, Petitioner's behavior.

And so

What is the ­­ you

justify this unusual authority?

21

It's fairly

Is that, as a general rule, sufficient to

MS. HARRINGTON:

I think if they do it in

22

such a way that then they spend the assets ­­ so the way

23

this issue usually comes up, the way it's come up in

24

most of the courts of appeals is that a debtor tries to

25

hide a nonexempt asset and then wastes the asset in some

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

way, usually by spending it, and then when it's

2

discovered, this is how it came up in the Malley case in

3

the First Circuit, then the Bankruptcy Court surcharges

4

the exempt property to sort of compensate the estate for

5

the wasted nonexempt property.

6

And so I think that ­­ that's certainly, in

7

our view, an appropriate exercise of authority under

8

Section 105, because there, the debtor is trying to ­­

money than he would be entitled to, but he has more

money during the bankruptcy and he spends that money ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, then it ­­

13

then it becomes a not very unusual exercise of

14

authority.

15

concealment of nonexempt assets is a fairly ­­ I don't

16

want to say it happens all the time ­­ but it's a fairly

17

common situation.

18

It becomes pretty common since the

MS. HARRINGTON:

I don't think it happens

19

terribly often, and when it does happen it isn't very

20

often that the debtor spends the money that he's

21

concealing.

22

so if it's discovered that he has hidden an asset that

23

he should have turned over, then the Bankruptcy Court

24

can merely order him to turn over the money, to turn

over whatever the asset was.

He's usually trying to keep the money.

But if the creditor had been the one who ran

up the attorneys' fees, he could certainly be paid under

4

the court's inherent authority, as in Chambers v. NASCO,

5

has to do.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ms. Harrington, at the

10

cert stage in this case, the Government suggested the

11

distinction between two situations:

12

the debtor to remove property from the estate, leaving

13

the creditors unsatisfied.

14

One, an action by

And that's where you say this power of

15

exemption can be taken away.

16

was where the creditors are paid in full and only the

17

trustee's litigation expenses are at issue.

18

dropping that distinction?

19

MS. HARRINGTON:

And then the other side

Are you

No, Justice Ginsburg, I

20

think ­­ I think the distinction we were trying to make

21

was more what I was discussing with the Chief Justice,

22

which is when a debtor wastes nonexempt assets and can't

23

turn them over, nonexempt property, can't turn it over to the

24

estate, and so then is forced to turn over exempt

25

property so that the surcharge doesn't pay attorneys'

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

fees; it just compensates the estate, and by extension

2

the creditors, for property that should have been turned

3

over.

4

Our suggestion was that this case, you could

5

decide the case on a narrow grounds and it wouldn't

6

necessarily resolve the issue in those other cases,

7

because in this case the sanction was to pay attorneys'

8

fees, which under a court's traditional inherent

9

authority, a court can order one party to pay another

10

party's attorneys' fees when it's in response to

11

extraordinary bad faith litigation conduct.

12

Now, even in Chambers v. NASCO, it's true

13

that the Court was divided in that case, but it was

14

mostly divided about whether the bad faith in that case

15

was in the litigation or before the litigation.

16

there is really no doubt that all of the bad faith

17

conduct in this case is in the litigation.

18

really a very traditional exercise of the court's

19

inherent authority to sanction that type of behavior

20

through attorneys' fees.

21

Here,

And that's

I think it's important to note also in this

22

case that the available remedies really are insufficient

23

to deal with this debtor's misconduct.

24

dismissal, discharge, and Rule 11 sanctions.

dismissal wouldn't do anything to punish him because his

denied a discharge of his debts, but then after that the

10

And so all the

It's also not clear that Rule 11 would be

11

sufficient to fully compensate the Trustee for the

12

expenses that have been incurred, because Rule 11

13

sanctions generally aren't available for matters on

14

appeal.

15

And as the record reveals, much of the

16

expenses that were incurred in this place ­­ in this

17

case resulted from the debtor's more than a dozen

18

appeals to the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel and to the

19

court of appeals.
