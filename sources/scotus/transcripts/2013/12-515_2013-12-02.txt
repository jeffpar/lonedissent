Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community.

Mr. Bursch.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BURSCH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
After Bay Mills' concession on the first

12

question presented, the only issue is whether Bay Mills

13

enjoys blanket immunity from suit when it engages in

14

illegal, off­reservation, commercial conduct.

15

answer is no, for at least two reasons.

16

And the

First, it makes no sense that Congress

17

intended States to have a Federal injunctive remedy for

18

illegal gaming on reservation, but no injunctive remedy

19

if that gaming takes place on land that is subject to

20

the State's exclusive jurisdiction.

21

Second, a tribe should not have greater

22

immunity than foreign nations.

23

if France opened up an illegal business in Michigan,

24

casino or otherwise, it would have no blanket immunity.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There's no dispute that,

Counsel, before you go

3
Alderson Reporting Company

1

on, could you address the jurisdiction question for me?

2

I'm not sure why you're here.

3

I see was entered on behalf of Little ­­ Little

4

Traverse's and not on behalf of the State.

The only injunction that

5

But ­­ and so, the counts that you're

6

arguing about were added after the injunction was

7

issued.

8

someone else's injunction?

9

How do you have jurisdiction to act ­­ to argue

MR. BURSCH:

That's not quite correct,

10

Justice Sotomayor.

11

two separate lawsuits.

12

then the other tribe was a plaintiff in the separate

13

case.

14

motion for injunction was filed, Michigan joined in that

15

motion, filed a brief supporting it, and everyone

16

proceeded under the assumption that both the tribe and

17

the State were asking for the injunction.

Originally, this case was filed as
Michigan was a plaintiff, and

Those cases were consolidated, and then when the

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

what the district court said.

20

explicitly said in its order granting the injunction

21

that the State hadn't filed an injunction, hadn't

22

intervened, and had only filed supporting papers in

23

support of Little Traverse's case.

24
25

That, in fact, is not
The district court

I'm a little ­­ I'm very, very confused as I
look at what the district court said.

4
Alderson Reporting Company

It explicitly

said you weren't part of the order.
MR. BURSCH:

Well, again, they were

3

consolidated cases.

injunction ­­

5

We were supporting the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I think "consolidated"

6

can have two meanings and ­­ and ­­ to be heard together

7

or to be joined together.

8

court understood that this was going to be joined

9

together.

10

I don't think the district

Why did it say what it did?

MR. BURSCH:

Well, I think it was

11

everybody's understanding that these were joined

12

together because the parties were pursuing the exact

13

same issues.

14

Sixth Circuit, there was no question in the Sixth

15

Circuit's mind ­­

16

And so then, once this went up to the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why didn’t you file an

17

injunction ­­ why does your brief say that you filed it

18

only in support of Little Traverse and not on your own

19

behalf?

20

MR. BURSCH:

Because, once the cases were

21

consolidated ­­ and at that point, we were even using

22

the same docket entries, there was already a motion on

23

file, so there was no need to have a second motion.

24

was clear to everyone that the State of Michigan and the

25

tribe were both pursuing that injunctive relief

5
Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official

1

together.

2

treated it.

3

And that's exactly the way the Sixth Circuit

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'll ask ­­ I'll ask

4

your opposition, but I don't see why the district court

5

would have made the point it did, if it believed that it

6

was dealing with both of you as parties.

7

MR. BURSCH:

Well, everyone has proceeded up

8

the chain, including in the Sixth Circuit opinion, on

9

the assumption that it was consolidated, that Michigan

10

was requesting an injunction and, in fact, that kind of

11

a procedural objection has never been raised by anybody,

12

certainly not at the petition stage.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, but we have to ­­ we

14

have to, if we're not sure, raise any jurisdictional

15

issue.

16

MR. BURSCH:

Sure.

But I think it was

17

eminently clear to the Sixth Circuit, if you read its

18

opinion ­­

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, it wasn't

20

eminently clear to the district court who entered the

21

order.

22
23
24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is that a

jurisdictional objection or a procedural one?
MR. BURSCH:
objection.

Your Honor, it's a procedural

The only jurisdictional question in this

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

case is whether there's Federal question jurisdiction

2

under 1331, which has been conceded, and the United

3

States agrees to that, and so I'm not going to spend my

4

time on that.

5

the scope of tribal immunity.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Where I would like to spend my time is on

Before you do that, can

7

you tell ­­ tell us why Michigan didn't resort to the

8

dispute resolution means that the compact provided?

9

compact said, if there's a dispute, it'll be decided by

10
11

arbitration.

The

Michigan bypassed that.

MR. BURSCH:

That's correct, Justice

12

Ginsburg, and there were two reasons for that.

13

first is that that provision was only discretionary, as

14

we explain in our reply brief.

15

the compact also makes clear that the tribe did not

16

waive its sovereign immunity for purposes of

17

arbitration.

18

The

But even more important,

So if we had gone to arbitration and

19

prevailed, if the arbitrator had reached the same result

20

as the Federal government did, as to the status of these

21

lands being not Indian lands, then ­­

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm sorry.

Could you

23

explain that?

24

that the whole point of the C&L Enterprises case is to

25

say that when a tribe agrees to arbitration, it has

Because I thought that the purpose ­­

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

waived its sovereign immunity for that purpose in that

2

proceeding.

3

special in this agreement?

4

Are you saying that there was something

MR. BURSCH:

I am, Justice Kagan, and I'm

5

glad you brought up C&L because, there, you had a

6

construction contract where there was invocation of an

7

arbitration remedy and it didn't specifically preserve

8

tribal immunity.

9

Here, we have the exact opposite.

In the

10

same paragraph 7 of the compact where we have the

11

arbitration provision, the tribe and the State agree

12

that, notwithstanding the arbitration provision, both

13

parties' sovereign immunity is not waived and that

14

it's ­­ it's preserved.

15

So, if we took a successful arbitration

16

judgment and then tried to reduce that to a Federal

17

judgment in court, they would have asserted immunity and

18

we would be in the exact same procedural posture that we

19

are right now, talking about the scope of tribal

20

immunity involving illegal off­reservation gaming.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why ­­ why did ­­

22

along the same lines, why did you assert sovereign

23

immunity as a defense when the tribe brought a

24

declaratory judgment action concerning the status of

25

those lands?

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. BURSCH:

Because, again, it wouldn't

2

have done any good for us to stipulate to jurisdiction

3

on the tribe's claim about the status of the lands

4

because simply having a declaratory judgment wouldn't

5

have given us any relief.

6

counterclaim for injunctive relief and the tribe,

7

undoubtedly, would have filed ­­ or
would have
asserted a tribal immunity there as well.

We would have had to file a

immunity, no matter how ­­

issue, I think.

13

judgment, they would have had to stop their gaming

14

activity.

If you had gotten a declaratory

15

MR. BURSCH:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No ­­
But you wouldn't have

17

gotten their property; isn't that what this suit is

18

about, you trying to take over the ­­ the casino?

19

MR. BURSCH:

No, we don't want to take over

20

the casino.

21

subject to Michigan's exclusive jurisdiction.

22

We want to stop illegal gaming on lands,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why not Ex Parte

23

Young?

24

courts that suggest there not might be Ex Parte Young

25

jurisdiction, but those cases are distinguishable.

You point to one or two cases in the lower

9
Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official

1

why not go after just the officials?

2

MR. BURSCH:

Two responses to that, Justice

3

Sotomayor, one, kind of a practical consideration and

4

then one a broader federalism principle that I ­­ that I

5

want to emphasize.

6

Ex Parte Young is an imperfect remedy for lots of

7

reasons, as we express in the brief.

8
9

The narrow practical point is that

It's well settled that you can't get
specific performance on the contract, you can't enforce

10

a State law in Federal court, you can't get money or

11

seize assets in an Ex Parte Young action.

12

why lower courts ­­

13
14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. BURSCH:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

But all you wanted to do

was stop them from doing the gaming casino.

15

17

And that's

Well, it's not clear ­­
You would have gotten

that.
MR. BURSCH:

It's not clear at all to us

19

that we would be able to get that relief, based on the

20

lower court holdings.

21

Now, the bigger sovereignty point is that,

22

if a foreign country, if France or Haiti came in and

23

opened the same casino, the State would have the full

24

panoply of remedies available to it.

25

those remedies because any additional immunity you give

10
Alderson Reporting Company

And it should have

Official

1

to the tribe, when it's engaging in illegal conduct on

2

lands subject to Michigan's exclusive jurisdiction, you

3

are necessarily taking away from the sovereign authority

4

of the State of Michigan.

5

That's a lesser remedy.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's ­­ all that ­­ the

6

enigma that you pointed out ­­ or the anomaly is ­­ is

7

certainly clear.

8

seemed to say that the tribe is immune on reservation,

9

off reservation, commercial activity, government

But what about Kiowa?

This Court

activity, it is immune, blanket immunity.
So how can you prevail without having this
Court modify Kiowa.
MR. BURSCH:

Here's how, Justice Ginsburg:

14

Because Kiowa involved a private party plaintiff.

15

did not involve a sovereign State.

16

stated, repeatedly, that States are different.

17

constitutional sovereigns, and so we aren't treated like

18

ordinary business plaintiffs.

19

It

And this Court has
We are

In that case, the fact that the plaintiff

20

could not enforce his promissory note did not directly

21

implicate a State police power.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Here ­­

What's your best

authority ­­ what's your best case for that proposition?
MR. BURSCH:

For the proposition that States

are different?

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That ­­ that States have a

2

lesser burden when they're faced with a sovereign

3

immunity defense?

4

MR. BURSCH:

I wouldn't say that it's a

5

lesser burden, but I think you need to analyze this as a

6

zero sum gain, that when you're talking about activity

7

taking place on sovereign State land and you're not

8

allowing the State to have its whole panoply of

9

remedies, that you've taken away an attribute of

10

sovereignty that ­­ that would have existed.

11
12
13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What's your best case for

that?
MR. BURSCH:

I would basically just cite all

14

of the cases this Court has decided over the last

15

quarter century involving the ADA, the ADEA, where this

16

Court has consistently recognized that States are

17

different.

18
19

Sovereigns ­­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You know, that's ­­ that's

a big reading assignment.

JUSTICE BREYER:

The question is this:

22

Three situations ­­ I think it's the same question

23

Justice Kennedy was driving at.

25

MR. BURSCH:

One, France opens up a

casino.

MR. BURSCH:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

Two, California opens up a

Yes.
Three, an Indian tribe

opens up a casino, okay?

6

MR. BURSCH:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Correct.
Now, what is it that says

8

that the State where the casino is located can sue

9

France?

What is it that says it can sue California?

10

All ­­ they all object.

11

the Indian tribe?

12

MR. BURSCH:

What is it that says it can sue

Thank you, Justice Breyer.

13

And, Justice Kennedy, hopefully, this will reduce the

14

reading assignment.

15

The case that says we can sue France is

16

Alfred Dunhill, which was this Court's decision that

17

first recognized the commercial distinction for foreign

18

nation immunity.

19
20
21
22

Now ­­

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, was that a statute or

common law?
MR. BURSCH:

That was common law, common law

development in Alfred Dunhill.

23

Now, shortly after that, Congress did enact

24

the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which essentially

25

codified this Court's common law rule, and once that

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

happens, then the common law development ­­

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MR. BURSCH:

Okay.

California?

So California, the case is

4

Nevada v. Hall in which ­­ this case said that a State's

5

sovereign immunity from suit does not extend when it's

6

got actors in another State.

7

acting in California, and the Court held that that actor

8

could be liable for suit in California.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:
law.

MR. BURSCH:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

Okay.

All those are common

Both ­­

11

13

There, Nevada's agent was

All common law.
Then what do you do about

Kiowa?
MR. BURSCH:

Well, that's the thing.

15

or Kiowa did not involve a State as sovereign.

16

involved a private business plaintiff, and it's

17

distinguishable on that basis.

18

Kiowa

It

And if you disagree with me and you think

19

that sovereign States should be treated the same way as

20

private party plaintiffs, then we would ask you to

21

overrule that part of Kiowa which suggested that tribes

22

can engage in illegal commercial conduct on land subject

23

to exclusive State jurisdiction without any ­­

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I think this is what

Justice Kennedy was ­­ was getting at, when he asked you

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

for a case, because what you're saying now is that when

2

the State is the plaintiff ­­

3

MR. BURSCH:

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5
6

Yes.
­­ the sovereign immunity of

the tribe disappears, so ­­
MR. BURSCH:

Well, not disappears.

But

7

it ­­ it disappears when they move off reservation and

8

they're acting in a commercial capacity.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

So what ­­ I guess

10

what's ­­ what's ­­ what's the case that would suggest

11

that, when the plaintiff shifts, the sovereign immunity

12

is ­­ goes away?

13

MR. BURSCH:

This Court's case that would

14

suggest that is the Oklahoma Tax Commission case because

15

that was a case where a State, not exercising a police

16

power, but one of its lesser powers, the power of

17

taxation, was attempting to tax cigarettes that were

18

being sold on Indian trust land by a tribe.

19

And in that case, the Court acknowledged

20

that, even on trust lands ­­ so this isn't on land

21

that's subject to State exclusive jurisdiction, that the

22

State would be able to tax those cigarettes being sold

23

to non­tribal members.

24
25

It's not ­­

JUSTICE BREYER:

You know, but the question

specifically then ­­ I think we're driving at the same

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

thing ­­ is, remember, you just cited to me two cases ­­

2

MR. BURSCH:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

Yes.
­­ one involving France and

one involving California.

5

MR. BURSCH:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
And I had assumed ­­ but

7

maybe I was wrong to assume ­­ that when I read those

8

cases, I will see, although a State can sue France,

9

although Nevada can sue California, a private individual

10

could not.

11

two cases?

Am I going to find that when I read those

12

MR. BURSCH:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well ­­
Now, I think the answer to

14

Justice Kagan is I'm not going to find it.

15

looking for authority, back to Justice Kennedy, that

16

will support your proposition that the State could sue

17

France, Nevada could sue California, but a private

18

individual could not.

19

MR. BURSCH:

So we're

I think the Oklahoma Tax

20

Commission case would be the closest because, even if

21

you had a private individual who was trying to sue a

22

tribe for conduct that was taking place on trust land,

23

they would not be able to do it.

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

What ­­

Now, what you're asking us

to do then, if the answer is what I now think you're

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

saying, is to say it's awfully complicated that,

2

although a State could sue an Indian tribe for something

3

that is outside the reservation, the State ­­ it's so

4

complicated that I'd like some good authority for it,

5

because a private person couldn't, but a State could

6

sue, and it's only in certain places.

7
8
9
10
11

MR. BURSCH:

Well, there ­­ there's lots of

places that you could draw the line in this case.
JUSTICE BREYER:

How about drawing the line

with Kiowa?
MR. BURSCH:

Here's what I'm going to

12

suggest:

13

the dissent, recognized that there were substantial

14

issues with applying tribal immunity on or off

15

reservation in the commercial context.

16

Nine justices in Kiowa, both the majority and

This Court had done away with that for

17

foreign nations in Alfred Dunhill.

18

Congress one more chance in ­­ in Kiowa, but ­­ but left

19

the question open for further common law development.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It decided to give

But once the Congress

21

didn't respond, the majority opinion in Kiowa ­­ I don't

22

know whether it's "Kiowa" or "Kiowa" ­­ said ­­ you

23

know, this is an unfortunate result, but Congress can do

24

something about it.

25

anything about it, and you are asking this Court,

Well, now Congress hasn't done

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

essentially, to modify the ­­ that precedent.

2

MR. BURSCH:

3

you need to modify it.

4

based on the fact that there's a private party plaintiff

5

there.

6

modify it in order to rule in our favor, it's ­­ it's

7

totally within your power.

I am.

I mean, I don't think

I think you could distinguish it

But if you feel otherwise, that you need to

8

As we explained, at length in the context of

9

foreign nation sovereign immunity, it's a body of common

10
11

law that this Court is free to modify as appropriate.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, why is the ­­ why is

12

that important?

13

before us important?

14

an Ex Parte Young action, you could certainly arrest

15

people who are running what you believe is an illegal

16

casino in the State, can't you?

17

Why is the issue that you've brought

MR. BURSCH:

In addition to the possibility of

Well, there are ­­ there are at

18

least two reasons why that is also an imperfect remedy.

19

The most obvious one is that it creates exactly the kind

20

of inter­sovereign conflict that Congress was trying to

21

avoid when it allowed, under IGRA, for States to get

22

injunctions, even for on­reservation conduct.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

But, in addition to that,

24

couldn't you have stopped this before it even started by

25

insisting in the compact that the tribe waive sovereign

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

immunity?

2

MR. BURSCH:

Well, that's ­­ that's a great

3

question, and the answer to that is twofold.

4

when the compact was negotiated back in 1993, this Court

5

had not decided Kiowa.

6

1998.

7

at that time that, if a tribe was engaged in illegal

8

commercial conduct off reservation, that, of course, a

9

State would have the ability ­­

thing Michigan asked for in its proposed amended compact

The issue of

15

I guess the question is:

On non­Indian

lands, you have a thousand ways to stop a casino that

17

you don't want.

sovereign immunity?

Why do you need the abrogation of

MR. BURSCH:

Because we tried to take the

20

least intrusive means necessary to stop the casino, to

21

not go in with the billy clubs and the guns and to

22

arrest tribal members, but to ask for a Federal civil

23

injunction.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I think that all of

our cases suggest that sovereign immunity is quite

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

important to a sovereign's dignity and that it's not

2

say, well ­­ you know, that would be less intrusive than

4

all these other things, bringing Ex Parte Young suits,

5

arresting people, just ­­ you know, conditioning the ­­

6

a license, stopping the casino from operating.

7

But ­­ you know, I suspect that the

And so you can

8

sovereign tribe here would say that, no, it's ­­ it's an

9

affront to their sovereignty to take ­­ to strip them of

10

sovereign immunity, and ­­ and none of these other

11

options that you have are that.

12

MR. BURSCH:

Right.

But, again, arresting

13

the other sovereign's officers is, with all respect, not

14

respectful to the tribe, which is why that's the course

15

we've pursued.

16

not as big as the tribe makes it seem because, in IGRA,

17

Section 2710, we have the ability to get an injunction

18

to stop illegal gaming taking place on reservation.

19

And the change we're asking for here is

And so it's really not that big a leap to

20

say, if they're engaging in illegal gaming off

21

reservation, likewise, there, we should be able to get

22

the least intrusive remedy, the one that is most

23

respectful of the tribe's sovereignty.

24
25

And, frankly, we're kind of surprised that
the United States would take the position that we're

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

better off going in and arresting or suing individual

2

officers because that's not the way sovereigns are

3

supposed to interact.

4

up a casino in Michigan and, rather than seeking a civil

injunction, we tried to arrest the French president and

25

individual, set up an illegal business, whether it's

27
Alderson Reporting Company

If any

1

prostitution, underage drinking, gaming, you name it, we

2

would have the full panoply of State civil and criminal

3

regulatory remedies available to us and could pick the

4

most appropriate one.

5

And, somehow, because this is a tribe, even

6

though they are operating on Michigan's land, where we

7

have exclusive regulatory jurisdiction, somehow, all

8

those remedies are circumscribed to imperfect remedies,

9

like Ex parte Young, which may or may not be successful,

10

or arresting our own citizens, and that's not respecting

11

the constitutional sovereign that Michigan represents in

12

this case.

13

And to get back to a question a number of

14

And the Second Circuit, interpreting Kiowa,

reluctantly concluded that the State did not have

ability to enforce by foreclosing on that property

review Kiowa.

This Court granted cert.

Eventually,

and they were able to go forward and pursue that remedy.

But ­­ you know, whether it's in the tax

context, whether it's the gaming context, whether it's

5

the criminal context ­­ you know, the amici briefs of

Oklahoma and Alabama are replete with the issues that

7

they are having as sovereigns in running up against the

contexts.

MR. KATYAL:

I see.
And I do think the text is the

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

best guide to what Congress wanted, and the text uses

2

"on Indian lands" 24 times.

3

the reason why there's not an absurdity, is twofold:

4

First, Congress, in IGRA, was reacting to this Court's

5

decision in Cabazon the year earlier, which had ousted

6

State court ­­ State regulatory jurisdiction entirely

7

from on­Indian­lands activity, so it changed the game

8

entirely.

9

And the reason for that,

Cabazon did nothing with respect to

10

off­Indian­lands activity. It left entirely intact all

11

the remedies we've been talking about, Justice Alito's

12

remedy about criminal sanctions ­­

13

Could it seize the

Well, it certainly could arrest

the customers, the employees, and so on.

19

we would not operate this casino without a square

ruling.

because we need a square ruling that says this is

on­Indian­lands activity.

And we would like that ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

it ­­ You don't have a square ruling, so I want to make

7

MR. KATYAL:

You think it is all right

You have got no

We think that that's a

8

consequence of tribal immunity, that when you ­­ when

9

they are seeking relief qua tribe, that's a different

10
11
12
13

thing, and that's, I think, a standard principle ­­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You, as a tribe ­­

you, as a tribe, would have no objection to that action?
MR. KATYAL:

Well, Your Honor, I think, if

14

that sort of circumstance unfolded, we might say let's

15

try and figure out a different way to deal with that.

16

First, of course, the most primary way is the compact

17

itself, and many compacts, for example, have arbitration

18

clauses ­­

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I know, you

20

could suggest different ways, and the State could tell

21

you ­­ you know, go fly a kite, we are prosecuting these

22

people.

23

And you'd have no objection to that?

MR. KATYAL:

Absolutely.

We are not here,

24

trying to say that we want to evade the law.

25

ruling ­­ a definitive ruling.

We want a

We believe, very

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

squarely, that this is on­Indian­lands activity.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

What about Ex

3

Parte Young?

4

sovereign immunity in an Ex Parte Young action?

5

Because, in your opposition to the complaint in this

6

case, you raised sovereign immunity as an objection to

7

the Ex Parte Young ­­

8
9

Are you willing to waive the tribe's

MR. KATYAL:

Sure.

Sure.

As part in the

district court, as part of ordinary ­­ as part of

10

ordinary litigation, we said that Ex Parte Young wasn't

11

applicable.

12

opposition says this, our merits brief says this, the

13

United States' brief says this, that Ex Parte Young

14

actions are available against tribes, just as ­­

15

But we do think ­­ and our brief in

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Not just are

16

available; that you would not assert sovereign immunity

17

if they brought an Ex Parte Young action.

18

MR. KATYAL:

Well, Your Honor, we would not

19

assert it to the limits of Ex Parte Young.

20

example, Ex Parte Young doesn't ­­ doesn't permit

21

reaching into the State coffers, and here, Count 5 of

22

the complaint tries to reach into the tribe's coffers.

23

So we do think that that type of Ex Parte Young ­­ that

24

is not permitted by Ex Parte Young, and that would be

25

impermissible.

34
Alderson Reporting Company

So, for

Official

1

If I could return to the second reason why I

2

think what Congress did wasn't ­­ wasn't ­­ you know,

3

creating any sort of anomaly like my friend says, the

4

reason is this:

5

compacts.

6

directly; it requires the tribe to affirmatively buy

7

into the idea of State law applying on the reservation.

8
9

All IGRA did in (A)(ii) is empower

It didn't abrogate immunity by itself

So if we could, just imagine a casino,
Justice Scalia, opened blatantly on a reservation, a

10

casino without a compact that was absolutely illegal.

We will call it "Casino Red."

I thought the statute says

15

that there is Federal court jurisdiction over any cause

16

of action initiated by a State or Indian tribe to enjoin

17

gaming activity that is conducted in violation of the

18

compact.

19
20

MR. KATYAL:

Yeah, on Indian lands, exactly.

And so my example of the casino here would be ­­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

22

MR. KATYAL:

Why couldn't this ­­
If there is no compact,

23

Justice Kennedy, there is no abrogation.

(A)(ii) does is it empowers the tribe and the compact,

and it requires the tribe affirmatively to come in.

35
Alderson Reporting Company

And so what

And

Official

1

that's why, off Indian land, there is standard tribal

2

immunity because the tribe hasn't said anything one way

3

or the other.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And you don't think that

5

1166 abrogates the immunity, which provides that, for

6

purposes of Federal law, all State laws are applicable?

7

MR. KATYAL:

Yeah, not at all, Your Honor.

8

All 1166 does is bring Federal ­­ that's about Federal

9

enforcement, not at all about State enforcement.

I would like to respond, at the outset, to the

only if Congress unequivocally consents in order to

18

allow suits by States.

Puyallup was off

But there's another point that I think ties

24

in with the questions about foreign sovereign immunity.

25

that the State of Alaska could not be sued by an Indian

2

tribe complaining about the distribution of State ­­

3

some State funds in Alaska, which does not have Indian

country.

The Court held that the suit was barred.

In doing so, the Court recognized that the

Eleventh Amendment had originally been understood to bar

suits only by individuals.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you,

Mr. Kneedler.
Mr. Bursch, you have five minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BURSCH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I want to clarify just two things about the

11

Court's precedent and then get back to the remedies

12

issue, which has taken up so much of our time this

13

morning.

14

First, the state of the law, when IGRA was

15

adopted in 1988 ­­ again, that was before Kiowa, I heard

16

my friend on the other side talk about Puyallup and how

17

that was an off­reservation case.

18

understand was that Puyallup was the third in a series

19

of three opinions that this Court issued.

20

that some of the earlier cases involved on­ and

21

off­reservation conduct.

22

And what you need to

And it's true

But as we point out in our reply brief ­­

23

this is at pages 167 to 68 of that opinion ­­ here, the

24

tribe's contention was that the fishing activities on

25

its reservation were immune, and Justice Stevens wrote

60
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that opinion, and then, only a few short years later, in

2

Kiowa, wrote his dissent, where he said we've never

3

before drawn that on/off­reservation distinction.

4

that's what Puyallup says.

5

So

With respect to Alfred Dunhill and the

6

evolution of foreign sovereign immunity as a common law

7

doctrine, four Justices agreed ­­ or signed on to the

8

entire opinion where that discussion was held.

9

One Justice agreed only with parts one and

10

two, but part two, on page 694, draws the commercial

11

line and says the problem here is that the district

12

court found the only evidence of an active state, as

13

opposed to a commercial act, was a statement by counsel

14

that the Cuban government and the intervenors denied

15

liability, and that's not enough.

16

And ­­ and the Court did reference the Tate

17

letter, but that's not why the Court changed the common

18

law of foreign nation sovereign immunity.

19

respectful consideration to the Executive Branch's

20

views, and then it reached its own conclusion about what

21

the common law should say.

It ­­ it gave

22

And, Justice Ginsburg, you are exactly right

23

to say, if it makes sense in the foreign nation context

24

and it makes sense here, apply it to both.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If we modified it to make

61
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

an exception for commercial activities off reservation,

2

could Congress reinstitute sovereign immunity if they

3

wanted?

4

MR. BURSCH:

No question they could.

Just

5

like when this Court in Cabazon said that States didn't

6

have the regulatory authority they thought they did to

7

regulate illegal gaming on reservation, and this Court

8

said ­­ you know, States can't really touch that.

9

Congress immediately jumped in and corrected course.

10

You know, conversely, with Alfred Dunhill,

11

when this Court drew the line at commercial conduct,

12

Congress immediately jumped in.

13

approval on that, and essentially adopted the line ­­

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And it put its stamp of

Well, there seems something

15

sort of strange about that, General, because as I read

16

Kiowa, what it was, was an invitation to Congress.

17

was saying ­­ you know, we have some concerns about

18

this, we're not sure it makes sense, we are dropping a

19

very broad hint that Congress should change it.

20

21

nothing.

MR. BURSCH:

Actually, Justice Kagan, I

think that's the way that the common law works, that the

3

Court does extend invitations to the Legislative And

4

Executive Branches.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Maybe we've learned

something in 15 years, such as the fact that ­­

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

that this did make sense.

Maybe we learned that Congress thought

10

MR. BURSCH:

11

conclusion either way.

12

and the government that somehow this Court lacks the

13

power to define common law tribal immunity, we think,

14

doesn't hold water.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think you could draw the
And the suggestion by the tribe

But I would have thought,

16

General Bursch, that one of the principles behind Indian

17

law in this country goes something like this:

18

can do pretty much whatever it wants with respect to

19

Indian tribes, but we will not likely assume that

20

Congress means to undermine tribal sovereignty.

21

will ­­ we will insist that Congress says that before we

22

put it into effect.

23

Congress

We

And, here, it's not just ­­ I mean, Congress

24

has given every indication that it does not wish to

25

change this, notwithstanding our hints that it should.

63
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. BURSCH:

I respectfully disagree.

And

2

the best evidence of that congressional intent is in

3

IGRA itself, where Congress abrogated immunity, even for

4

on­reservation conduct.

5

Think about what an extraordinary remedy

6

that is, that, even on the reservation, a State would

7

have the ability to go into court and get a Federal

8

injunction, rather than send in police to arrest ­­

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

He's adding one thing,

10

which is, as you've just heard, that the Indian tribes

11

are in the same Eleventh Amendment type position as the

12

Principality of Monaco before the treaty.

13

MR. BURSCH:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right, but ­­
They didn't participate in

15

the convention and the Principality of Monaco was held

16

to be immune, presumably, even from commercial activity.

17

Let Congress change it.

18

that, I think, is their basic argument.

That's what Kiowa says.

And

19

And if it's a wash ­­ I mean, I hate to put

20

it this way because it sounds like a joke, but it isn't

21

meant to be ­­ in this case, if it's a wash, follow the

22

precedent.

23

MR. BURSCH:

I think Alfred Dunhill makes

24

clear that this Court can change the stream of the

25

common law when it comes to ­­ to immunity.

64
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Really quickly on ­­ on these remedies ­­

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Then go back to the

3

beginning question.

4

but the waiver under IGRA is not for damages.

5

for injunctive relief.

6

Why are you asking us to waive sovereign immunity with

7

respect to damages?

8
9

MR. BURSCH:

You have remedies you don't like,
It's only

You have that in Ex Parte Young.

I'll explain why, if I may

answer the question.

With respect to arresting, Ex

10

Parte Young remedies, enforcing the arbitration and

11

having them waive immunity, all these things are unclear

12

whether they're available to us.

13

issued a definitive opinion that said, we have each one

14

of those remedies, that would do great good in this

15

area.

16

And if this Court

But the reason why we think that you should

17

go farther than that is because, if sovereignty means

18

anything, it means allowing people to define what is

19

illegal on their own lands, whether it's prostitution,

20

gaming, or underage drinking, and being able to use the

21

full enforcement power of the sovereign State, civil and

22

criminal, to enforce those laws.
