ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

10

it please the Court:

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

We ask you to resolve this case narrowly by

reaffirming that an arbitrator, rather than a court,

That holding would decide the question

issue.

20

so it says a precondition to that non­existent agreement

21

Its position in this Court is that there is no

25

parties' consent to arbitrate?

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

We do not take that

2

position.

3

governments in NAFTA have done, as the Solicitor

4

point ­­ Solicitor General points out is the language of

5

the U.S./South Korea Bilateral Investment Treaty, unlike

6

this one, we think it would be settled that a Court

7

would resolve the dispute.

8

If a party were to say that, as the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So if the

9

issue is what did the parties ­­ as I see it ­­ what did

10

the parties intend on this question, why isn't the first

11

options Howsam divide the one that we should follow in

12

this setting?

13

we shouldn't follow that.

14

heightened deference to the foreign state, but I'm not

15

sure why because the issue is always about what did the

16

parties intend.

17

The Solicitor General is suggesting that
We should give some sort of

And, if the issue is always about that,

18

don't we look at the text, the custom and practice of

19

the industry, the behavior between the parties?

20

we look at all of the factors we normally look at in

21

deciding whether something goes to a substantive or

22

procedural issue?

If you did decide the question of consent, I

think you would do it in a three­part opinion, and some

20

of the parts are contested, and some aren't.

21

how I would write the opinion:

22

at our decision in Howsam, and it's undisputed here that

23

if this was an ordinary contract case, just between two

24

American companies, then BG Group would win because this

25

looks just like a procedural precondition.

This is

Part one would say look

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

It's like the John Wiley staged grievance

2

procedure, and I don't think the other side argues

3

against that.

4

Then the other side has given you two

5

different arguments for why you wouldn't apply Howsam

6

and why you might have a different analytical framework.

7

The first argument, we could call it part two of the

8

opinion, is the argument of the United States.

9

the United States says is, look, the difference between

10
11

And what

this and Howsam is it's an international case.
And what's different in international cases

12

is that, when you dealt with Howsam, you dealt with a

13

set of expectations between parties agreeing to

14

arbitrate that may not apply in the international

15

context, and so maybe it's different.

16

Now, this ­­ and the reason they say that

17

it's different is that an international case, when it's

18

cited in the United States, is governed by the New York

19

Convention.

20

it's a commercial case, whether it's an international

21

treaty arbitration case, what the rule of judicial

22

review is ­­ and that's what we're looking at here, do

23

the arbitrators finally decide the question, or does a

24

court, on judicial review, decide it?

25

And in a New York Convention case, whether

16

this precondition will be resolved de novo or, instead,

17

it will be resolved deferentially because they don't

19

that the applicable law will be the citeus of the

Convention.

There have been thousands of challenges to

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

I'm not sure that this

7

argument helps you, but it's your argument.

8

arbitration took place in the United States because the

9

parties agreed that's where it would take place, right?

But this

10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Correct.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

So your ­­ your argument is

12

that, by agreeing that the arbitration would take place

13

in the United States, they bought into U.S. arbitration

14

law, no international modification?

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That's correct.

And that is

16

what has been true in every New York Convention case

17

ever decided in the United States and, so far as we are

18

aware, every case decided by every New York Convention

8
Alderson Reporting Company

1

The whole point of these treaties, as I

2

understand it, is to take these disputes out of the

3

courts because of distrust, at least of the courts of

So the government's position has very

Now, Argentina does make the argument that

you've described, and this is the next part of the

21

opinion, if we got past the government's position, which

22

I don't think has any precedent for having a special

23

international rule, we come to Argentina's argument.

24

And Argentina says this:

25

Howsam is that this is a unilateral contract,

Look, the reason this isn't

effectively, and that is, we put our treaty out there,

2

and now, BG Group has to do something in order to create

3

an arbitration agreement in the first place because we

4

don't have an arbitration agreement with them, we haven’t

5

consented to arbitration, then, because of that, call it a

6

precondition, call it whatever you want, because an

7

arbitration agreement hasn't formed, the arbitrators

8

have no power to decide anything, and, therefore, you

9

can't defer to their judgment.

10

We would never expect them to have the power

11

to decide anything Argentina says because there's no

12

arbitration agreement at all.

of the opinion, and it will get to the points you

raised, Justice Alito.

Wait 18 months and then pursue

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

There is a

principle of latches, but there is an equivalent

22

principle of equitable tolling, so it's true that we

23

could go there.

24

25

is.

I do think, ultimately, it's a point in

1

We'll recall, of course, that while we could

2

leave ­­ we could file a claim in the Argentine courts,

the Argentine courts, of course, would have the power to

7

here.

8
9

They couldn't bind us.

They

They wouldn't have to decide

And the question is, if you have a provision
like that, which is, effectively, go wait in the

10

Argentine courts, does anybody seriously think that that

11

determines your consent to arbitrate, when it is that

12

that act, going and sitting, can't have any effect on

the case whatsoever.

14

Do we really ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's not

17

people a period of time to negotiate or discuss before

2

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

(Laughter.)

4

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

We would be.

But, Mr. Chief Justice, my

5

point isn't that it's not important.

6

that it's important; they negotiated for it.

7

is that whether it's important or not doesn't tell you

8

if it's a procedural step or a substantive step, in

9

terms of their agreeing to arbitrate with us.

were to conclude that the court of appeals was right,

13

that it is for the Judicial Branch to decide whether

14

there is an arbitration agreement and duty to arbitrate.

15

Then I were to further conclude that, given Argentina's

16

position, they have waived the judicial requirement and

17

that this arbitration should proceed.

18

that second question because it wasn't raised.

19

Suppose we ­­ or at least I,

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I can't reach

Justice Kennedy, the way you

20

would resolve that issue, I believe, is to get to

21

Argentina's argument that it did not consent to

22

arbitration, that there is no ­­ there is no

23

arbitration agreement in the first place, you would have

24

to go outside the question presented to begin with.

25

Remember, the question presented that you

12
Alderson Reporting Company

1

granted certiorari on, to resolve a very distinct

2

circuit conflict at the urging of the arbitration

3

community was what do we do if we have an arbitration

4

agreement and this is a precondition to arbitration?

5

If you were going to decide the antecedent

6

question, the question before that, is there an

7

arbitration agreement at all, which is my part three, it

8

is the argument that Argentina is raising in this Court,

9

then I think you have to carry it all the way through.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, let me just put

it ­­ I think there is ­­ this is a close case.

there is substantial merit, the United Kingdom court is

13

correct and that the court of appeals here is correct,

will be solved by arbitration?

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

If

Perhaps I can explain why it's there ­­

because it is odd, I will tell you, and I will tell you

22

that, in deciding this question that Argentina is adding

23

to the case, in the context of this local litigation

provision, it is a very strange vehicle to do that.

25

There are only ­­ only 1 percent of bilateral investment

It's a historic remnant.

And it is a remnant of an era of espousal.

8

It used to be the case that, before these treaties, that

9

an investor in BG's position would have to go to the

And when Argentina first created the

But it is absolutely critical that we look at

It's very much, Mr. Chief Justice, like the

John Wiley case, which is structured, one, you will have

22

step one of our grievance process; step two, within five

23

days you have to go to our next step of the grievance

25

It could have stopped, theoretically, at any of those.

If you had given up at step one or two, you would well

2

have been bound by it.

3

But the question you are being asked here,

4

if we could just return to if you are trying to decide

5

this de novo or, instead, defer to the arbitrator's

6

interpretation of whether this litigation provision is

7

binding, is, fundamentally, when Argentina went into

8

this treaty, did it think that the arbitrators were

9

going to resolve the disputes?

10

Right?

Did it expect ­­ it's a question of consent,

11

Justice Sotomayor ­­ did it expect that the answers to

12

these questions would come from the arbitrators or,

13

instead, the courts?

14

And when we are talking about the process

15

for getting it going ­­ Justice Ginsburg talked about

16

the timing, do you have to do this for 18 months, there

17

is another provision here about 3 months, the natural

18

understanding is that there is an arbitration agreement,

19

Argentina knew that it could only get this treaty if

20

there was a guarantee to the investors that they would

21

be able to arbitrate, and so expects the arbitrators to

22

decide this.

23

Imagine Argentina's world, if you will.

24

Argentina's world is that every timing question, whether

25

something has to be filed on blue paper ­­ I have no

procedural step is, instead, a condition on its consent

3

to arbitrate, and that doesn't seem to make any sense at

4

all.

5

Every

There have to be procedural prerequisites.
And Argentina would recharacterize this as,

6

as I said, a unilateral agreement.

7

Argentina says ­­ posts a sign on a pole and says, if

8

you pay me ­­ if you find my dog, I will give you $100.

And so you have to perform an act.

Argentina's sovereignty should make a difference here.

3

And this is kind of the second theme of the brief of the

4

United States.

5

And I would say about that that the Foreign

6

Sovereign Immunities Act, which was discussed, of

7

course, in the last argument, has an express waiver of

8

sovereign immunity for arbitration awards that's

controlled here.

talk about what the treatment of these issues in other

countries is, we are unaware, again, of any country in

the world where the arbitral system of review in the

15

courts changes in the slightest because one party

16

happens to be a signatory to a treaty, and that makes a

ton of sense.

relationship.

The important point I would make is that

8

there is ­­ when the other side points to decisions in

9

which a court reviews de novo a jurisdictional ruling of

10

an arbitral tribunal, none of those decisions are unique

11

in any way to the fact that it was an international

12

arbitration or an international treaty arbitration.

13

Their international rule, the U.K. rule, the

14

rule in lots of other countries, is simply about

15

arbitration.

16

that this case might well be reviewed de novo in the

17

United Kingdom, for example, is that the jurisdictional

18

decision in essentially every arbitration of any kind in

19

the United Kingdom will be reviewed de novo.

the arbitrator decides, but, ultimately, the court can

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That is not the most current

view, Justice Ginsburg.

4

which was the most recent court of appeals decision in

5

France in 2004, the court adopted the

6

procedural­substantive distinction that very much

7

parallels Justice Breyer's opinion in the Howsam case.

8

But, even if it were the case, it's because

One is the one that the arbitrators relied

on, and that is in the arbitration provision 8­4, which

6

is on 10A, it says, "The arbitral tribunal shall decide

7

the dispute in accordance with the provisions of this

8

agreement, the laws of the contracting party involved in

the dispute, including conflict of laws," and, then, at

the end of the sentence, "the applicable principles of

MS. ANDERS:

please the Court:

Thank you, counsel.

20

The government's position in this case is

21

based on the fact that this case involves a bilateral

22

investment treaty in which the states' parties set forth

23

a standing offer to arbitrate in the treaty itself.

24

Because it's the treaty that determines whether there is

25

an arbitration agreement in this case, principles of

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

treaty interpretation have to be used to assess whether

2

there is an agreement.

3

So, therefore, applying the domestic law

4

presumptions that are set forth in Howsam to this type

of investor­state arbitration we think would not be

appropriate.

unless the investor submits the claim to arbitration in

on the state's consent.

States investment treaties and free trade agreements

satisfies certainly procedural conditions.

procedural­type requirements, like notice requirements,

a condition on the United States' consent to arbitrate,

Because you read this

We would look to mandatory

language in the arbitration agreement.
MS. ANDERS:

I think that's right, but the

23

problem with applying Howsam is that it's a presumption

24

that is purely based on the nature of the requirement,

25

so the fact that it is a notice requirement, the fact

34
Alderson Reporting Company

1

that it is a time limit, that that means that it's

2

procedural and, therefore, the arbitrators would decide,

3

unless it is clearly stated ­­

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

consent, what they are looking to are ­­

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

I

Well, there is nothing in

14

the treaty that talks about consent at all, so we have

15

to decide whether some requirement is a consent, is on

16

something which consent is conditioned, or it's just a

17

procedural requirement that would be decided by an

18

arbitrator.

19

Would you not ­­ would you disagree with the

20

proposition that, if something really is trivial, it

21

doesn't seem to accomplish much of anything, it's a

22

historical vestige, it's unlikely to be a condition of

23

consent.

24
25

MS. ANDERS:

I think that one of the things

the Court could look to is the nature of the

35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

requirements, does it serve sovereign functions?

2

think, in doing that analysis, it's important to look to

3

what the state says are the functions that its

4

requirements are serving.

5

But I

So for instance, our notice requirement in

6

our treaties, they serve the purpose of giving us

7

advance notice of particular claims and time to correct

8

problems that may have been caused ­­ you know, that we

9

can correct and, therefore, avoid arbitration to begin

10

with.

11

So I think you would look to the nature of

12

the requirement, the text of the treaty, whether it's

13

mandatory or whether it's expressly conditional.

14

can also look, obviously, to what this Court has called

15

ease of interpretation, so that would be the

16

postratification understanding.

17

You

If this were our treaty, we would bring

18

in ­­ you know, the letter of transmittal that the State

MR. BLACKMAN:

Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

that the treaty partners agreed that only an arbitration

It depends on the issue.

After that, depending on the issue, there

will or will not be judicial review of some kind, and

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, what would

15

happen ­­ what would happen in this case if there was a

16

judge's strike, so none of the courts were operating in

17

Argentina?

18

What would happen then?

MR. BLACKMAN:

Well, all you have to do is

19

actually file.

20

which is an extreme hypothetical, all you need to do is

21

file and wait the 18 months.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

23

No, but the clerk's office

is closed.

MR. BLACKMAN:

No.

But, in this case, what

would happen would be what happened in First Options and

25

2

It would be very imprudent for the defendant in that

case to do nothing and default.

5

So you present the issue to the arbitrators

Thank you, counsel.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS GOLDSTEIN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, I do have

20

a rule that distinguishes the A4 paper, and that rule

21

should be, and we think it does follow from the analysis

22

of Howsam, which is just a thinking about when people

23

make agreements and what they expect is that an

24

arbitration agreement is formed and a party consents to

25

arbitration when they guarantee that the ultimate

56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

decision can be made by an arbitrator and not a court.

2

It's forum selection.

3

decision made by the arbitrator.

4

We're going to have the ultimate

And that rule is applied in the investment

5

treaty context as follows:

6

to arbitration when the investor is guaranteed that

7

their claim can ultimately decide ­­ be decided by a

8

court, and the state can't force it to be ultimately ­­

9

excuse me ­­ by an arbitrator, and the state can't force

10
11

And it is there is consent

it to ultimately be decided by a court.
And I'll show you where that rule, how that

12

line is divided in this treaty.

13

the three conditions at the beginning.

14

paper.

15

a treaty claim, you have to be suing another party to

16

the treaty.

17

And that is, I gave you
Those are not A4

You have to be a U.K. investor, you have to have

And if those aren't true, then there is no

18

arbitration agreement and Argentina has every reason to

19

say I have no idea why these arbitrators are here, this

20

person's from Ecuador, not from the United Kingdom.

21

But on the other things ­­ at that point,

22

once ­­ we are a U.K. investor and we have invested in

23

Argentina, that's the performance that is required, once

24

we did that, then we are protected by Article 8, the

25

dispute resolution provision.

57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1

And you look at Article 8 and you say, okay,

2

does that guarantee that you have the right to

3

ultimately have it decided by the arbitrators?

4

Argentina actually insist that it will be ultimately

5

decided by a court?

6

And it's the former.

Or can

We made clear, I

7

think, and nobody disagrees, that they can't force us to

8

go into court and wait for that ruling, take that ruling

9

in any way, shape, or form.

10

Now, my friend says that, look, this is like

11

a unilateral agreement, and this is like where I say

12

I'll hire you to paint my house, if you post a bond.

13

Well, that is a terrible argument for them because this

14

treaty reads as if he was saying, I'll let you paint my

15

house if you post the bond or I post the bond, because,

16

remember, the thing they want us to perform on,

17

supposedly, is something they can do, too.

18

Whoever heard of unilateral agreement that
was conditioned on either party doing something? There’s nothing they’re
waiting for us ­­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

that.

2

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I see.

I believe the

3

answer, when this was put to them, his answer to your

4

question was, I just don't have to do that.

5

was ­­ and it's a perfectly fine position to take, and

6

that is he's not going to help me win my case.

7

His view

Fine.

But it does describe whether this is a

8

condition on his consent, that he could do it, too, and if

9

he could do it, too, it can't be something that he is

10

waiting for me to perform at all.

11

I would also say that, on this question of

12

whether it has any value, that all that you got,

13

Justice Alito, was that, if I were to pursue the case in

14

the Argentine courts, maybe something would happen, we

15

might learn a little about Argentine law.

16

First thing's first.

I don't have to pursue

17

it.

18

courts were closed, he said, I just have to put the

19

piece of paper down.

20

Remember, his whole point is, when asked if the

So if this were a treaty provision that

21

actually involved litigation, involved exhaustion of

remedies, where we might learn something, that might be

24

25

But this is a waiting period in an

And, remember, as well, these are treaty

59
Alderson Reporting Company

1

claims, and it is perfectly clear and undisputed that

2

the local court, even if it decided the treaty claims,

3

their ruling would not bind the arbitrators.

4

says, well, hey, we might win.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And so he

I'm not so sure you

6

don't have to do anything, you just submit the paper.

7

It says you have to submit it to the decision of the

8

competent tribunal.

9

okay, now, you have to file your brief, and you say, I'm

10

not going to, I'm not sure that you've submitted it to a

11

tribunal for its decision.

12

And if the submission requires,

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I

13

will then say that's a possible argument.

14

figure out who we would ordinary expect to figure that

15

out.

16

This is a treaty provision.

But let's

It's ­­ the

17

experts involved in treaty interpretation are the three

18

neutral arbitrators, who really do this every day.

19

what they do.

20

interpreting treaties.

21

It's

They have enormous expertise in

And so you might say ­­ and it would be a

22

perfectly valid interpretation, well, maybe submitting

23

it to the local court requires some activity.

24

really expect, when the U.K. and Argentina ended this

25

treaty, that it would actually be the Supreme Court of

60
Alderson Reporting Company

But do we

Official

1

the United States that would be deciding that question,

2

or instead, the arbitrators?

3

And if you believe it's the arbitrators,

4

then we win, because it's the kind of procedural

5

question that we put to them purposely.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That seems that

7

you're not totally circular in begging the question.

8

don't know that a sovereign would be anxious to submit

9

its sovereignty to three international law experts.

10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

And, surely, they wouldn't,

11

Mr. Chief Justice, but that's the point of the treaty.

12

Remember, my friend said, look, if it weren't for this

13

treaty, we could never sue them.

14

there's the treaty because, if there wasn't the treaty

15

and we couldn't get relief from them, we would have

16

never invested.

I

That's the reason

And so the whole point of this treaty is to

put these disputes into arbitration.

this treaty ­­ the thing that matters in all the

Argentine court.
