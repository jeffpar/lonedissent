Mr. Schneider.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY G. SCHNEIDER,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER,
APPOINTED BY THIS COURT
MR. SCHNEIDER:

May it please ­­ Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
This is a case about statutory construction.

13

Specifically, under 18 USC 2259, must a victim's ­­

14

victim's losses be proximally caused by a defendant's

15

offense conduct before a sentencing judge can award

16

restitution?

17

losses must be proximately caused.

18

The short answer to the question is all

Eleven courts of appeals and the government

19

agree that this circuit ignored the plain text of the

20

statute and the enumerated enforcement provisions of

21

3664 to craft a restitution scheme where the possession

22

of two images of child pornography resulted in the award

23

of $3.4 million to Doyle Paroline which was strictly ­­

24

jointly and severally liable.

25

In my time before the Court, I wish to

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

address, first, why the Fifth Circuit decision is

2

incorrect, and second, why the government's concept of

3

aggregate causation conflicts with its statutory burden

4

of proof contained in 3664(e).

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, before ­­ before you

6

do that, could you explain why there is an issue of

7

proximate causation here?

Why ­­ why isn't there

8

clearly proximate cause?

Why is it ­­ why does it

9

matter?

10

MR. SCHNEIDER:

Well, I think there has to

11

be ­­ in all restitution cases, the issue is whether or

12

not the person's conduct caused the harm and losses, and

13

harm and losses are two different things.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes.

But why ­­ why isn't

15

the issue here a question of factual causation?

16

losses proximately caused ­­ is proximately caused by

17

the possession of child pornography?

18

MR. SCHNEIDER:

What

That's a fact­intensive

19

question, and that's what the district court has to

20

determine, whether on the facts presented, there are

21

identifiable losses that were caused by the defendant's

22

conduct, and there can be.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It seems you're

24

confusing proximate cause with cause in fact.

25

two legal requirements, but not the same.

4
Alderson Reporting Company

They are

Proximate

2

cause is foreseeability.
There's no argument, I think, that anyone

3

who possesses child pornography knows that the

4

individual depicted is going to feel invaded by that

5

viewing, so there's no issue that the person is hurt.

6

The question is a different one, which is

7

the cause in fact.

8

Alito was talking about.

9

about proximate cause when it's a different concept

10

I think that's what my colleague Sam
So why do you continue to talk

that's at issue?

11

MR. SCHNEIDER:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well ­­
Is her treatment ­­ I

13

think you're arguing that her treatment has to be a

14

"but­for" this possession.

15

MR. SCHNEIDER:

I think they go hand­in­hand

16

because when dealing with proximate cause, would the

17

conduct ­­ is the losses the natural sequence from the

18

conduct and the result?

19

would the losses have occurred, but for the conduct.

And what we're dealing with is

20

And in this situation ­­ in this case, where

21

the damage model was created six months before the

22

notice is received, then you don't have the relationship

23

between the loss and the conduct or the notice of the

24

conduct.

25

And it's a real problem.

But the ­­ the important consideration in

to that question, when we have what seems to be a clear

"The court shall ­­ shall order restitution for any

MR. SCHNEIDER:

Only if ­­ if the losses are

11

the result of the offense because the government's

12

burden of proof is that they must demonstrate, by a

13

preponderance of the evidence, that the losses sustained

by the victim are the result of the offense.

22

there's evidence that ­­ of not ­­ of the victim having

23

knowledge of an individual, and in that case ­­ those

cases, there have been awards of restitution, some of

them 3,000, 5,000, 15,000, 30,000.

10
Alderson Reporting Company

But there's some

knowledge and there's some evidence for a judge to base

It's impossible to tell

Your answer is that, in those cases, the

victim gets nothing.

16

17

that's your answer to Justice Breyer's question.

19

impossible to determine what percentage of the harm is

20

21

child pornography.

MR. SCHNEIDER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

7
8
9
10

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As Justice Breyer indicated, there really

11

are three stark choices before the Court in this case.

12

Paroline's position is that, because of a proximate

13

causation requirement, Amy can obtain nothing in

14

restitution.

15

Amy's position is that, because multiple

16

people have contributed to her single loss, she can

17

obtain the full restitution for all of her losses from

18

every criminal defendant.

19

The government's position is that there is a

20

solution that tort law has developed for providing some

21

restitution for Amy, not the entire restitution that

22

would be owed on account of her entire loss.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

Well, now ­­ not

24

because tort law has developed that, I mean, I frankly

25

don't agree with what you say modern tort law is

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

supposed to allow, and ­­ and Keeton ­­ you know,

2

doesn't really establish that that's what the courts now

3

do.

4

But even without agreeing with that, can't I

5

find that that is the system that this statute intended

6

to impose?

7

of statutory interpretation.

8

what does modern tort law allow, but the question is

9

what, reasonably, could Congress have meant by this

10
11
12
13

I mean, we're dealing here with a question

statute?
MR. DREEBEN:

Scalia.

It dates back to

And this Court applied that section in the

hold that apportionment of the damages was required in a

22

pollution case, where all the pollution had merged into

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But how do you square

your position with the statutory language?

16
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official

1

statutory language requires mandatory restitution order

2

for the, quote, "full amount of the victim's losses."

3

It also forbids courts to ­­ to decline to issue an

4

order, double negative, but it can't ­­ a court can't

5

refuse to issue an order on the ground that the victim

6

has been compensated by any other source.

7

It seems to me that that language, as crazy

8

as it seems, to you or ­­ to you, compels joint and

9

several liability because it's saying any ­­ all losses,

10

full amount of losses, and you can't offset her

11

compensation from any other sources.

12

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Sotomayor, I think

13

that the key to reading the statutory language is that

14

the definition of "victim" refers to a victim of the

15

offense in this case.

16

individual harmed as a result of a commission of a crime

17

under this chapter.

So the term "victim" means the

18

The government's burden of proof in Section

19

3664(e) refers to demonstrating the amount of the loss

20

sustained by a victim as a result of the offense.

22

harm that the ­­

I hope that the Court will

5

read the "as a result of" language to require causation,

6

but to interpret it in light of the way causation has

7

been understood in the unique circumstances that you

8

have here.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you don't deny

10

but­for.

11

that there need not be but­for cause here.

12

I haven't understood your submission to be

MR. DREEBEN:

There's collective, aggregate

13

14

this is not to accept Paroline's position that, even if

15

it ­­ you took me out of the equation, Amy's harm would

16

be very severe.

17

And the way that tort law dealt with

Unquestionably true.

What tort law said is that, if a

18

multiplicity of actors inflict a single harm and one of

19

them comes forward with a reason that, if accepted,

20

would exonerate all of them, then that cannot be a

21

proper test of causation.

22

The proper test is aggregate causation,

cause, and each one of the individuals in that set can

Of course, yes.

Amy have an expert that comes in and testifies, as a

result of their experience, that the psychological harm

caused by knowing that those images are available to

11

on average, whatever, a certain amount of counseling for

13

responsible for that harm, regardless of what else

So that the one individual is

Now, he may say, well, it's kind of unfair

than the aggregate causation issue that you're

19

If you have expert testimony, and there will

20

be expert testimony on the other side, that says it

out, without regard to anything else, that an individual

Mr. Chief Justice, that would

If there's a specific amount

of harm caused and if Amy could find an expert who would

testify to that respect and it would require, say, six

14

counseling sessions, and it would set her back in

15

employment for a year, then I guess a court could, if it

found that credible, conclude that a certain amount of

loss is attributable directly ­­

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you're ­­ you're

Mr. Dreeben, I would

really like you to tell us, concretely, what the

14

government's approach would be; that is, we have all is

15

one position, nothing is another position, and the

16

middle.

17

what I gather from your brief, you say there should be a

18

reasonable formula to arrive at a starting point for

19

further analysis.

20

The government comes down in the middle, and

So I don't know what you propose as a

21

starting point.

22

Court should use for its starting point?

23

What is the reasonable formula that the

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Ginsburg, the courts

24

have approved several different formulas as not being an

25

abuse of discretion.

One camp of courts approves a view

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in which the government submits the number of people who

2

have been ordered to pay restitution to Amy, and that

3

number is then divided into the total harm, measured by

4

monetary means, that Amy has established.

5

provides a starting point.

And that

6

So, for example, in this case, that starting

7

point would be around $18,000, and then courts can

8

adjust that.

9
10
11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How do you get to the

18,000?
MR. DREEBEN:

By considering the number of

12

defendants who have been ordered to pay restitution to

13

Amy because that provides some certainty in the face of,

14

as Justice Alito pointed out, the great difficulty in

15

determining how many people have actually viewed these

16

pictures ­­

18
19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How does that ­­ I'm

sorry.
MR. DREEBEN:

­­ the number of people who

20

have been ordered to pay to restitution represents a

21

judicial finding that, in fact, her picture is involved

22

in that person's offense.

estimate of the total pool of violators.

6

You said that the Chief Justice's question

The alternative that I would

propose in that instance is to look at other similarly

8

situated child pornography victims and take a look at

9

what district courts have been awarding to those victims

average range.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But ­­ you know ­­ I mean,

it struck me, when I read your brief, that it said, I

whether each violation is worth 1,000 or 5,000 or

16

50,000.

MR. DREEBEN:

Not necessarily because, as I

indicated, Mr. Chief Justice, the defendants aren't all

identical.

16

defendants may possess a hundred images.

4

MR. DREEBEN:

may have been predicated on a very early period, where

it was not clear that Amy would be as victimized as she

9

continually re­inflicts the abuse on the victim, so that

she cannot make a fresh start and say it's finally over,

11

I've put this behind me, I can now move on with my life.

The very vice of child

The continuing re­victimization of her is

what justifies and creates the increased harms.

the extent that you can, to help district judges get a

19

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Ginsburg, the ­­ the

formula that I proposed is the one that the government

has been suggesting to district courts around the

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT AMY UNKNOWN
MR. CASSELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

19

Remarkably, this morning, the other parties

20

have taken a statute that promises Amy she will receive

21

restitution for all of her losses and interpreted it to

22

be a statute that has fudge factors, imprecision,

23

estimation, to produce some kind of an award that, in

they prosecuted for this, and those people caused it

15

just as much, and so let's divide it by five.

16

MR. CASSELL:

But, I mean, immediately,

The solution to the point that

17

you're raising, Justice Breyer, is to recognize that

18

Petitioner was a contributing cause to all of Amy's

19

losses.

20

Amy's losses come from a vast, faceless,

21

anonymous crowd of thousands of people scattered around

22

the globe, from Denver to Denmark, who are looking at

23

pictures of her being raped as an eight­year­old girl.

24

And that aggregate group of people all contribute to a

25

loss.

criminally culpable defendants.

And the

fundamental problem with the government's position is

2

that, after four­and­a­half years of litigation, we

5

What the government proposes to do is to

cast district courts adrift, as they have been for the

21

We don't know whether there are going to be

Congress acted against that understanding and said she

And one of the beauties of our approach is

that we estimate, within 2 to 3 years, if you affirm the

piecemeal restitution requests, collecting as little as

Now, certainly, Congress could have drafted

the statute in different ways, but every single word or

codified this Court's opinion in Hughey, in creating a

21

burden of proof on the government to demonstrate that

22

the losses sustained by the victim are the result of the

23

offense and created a number of new mandatory

24

restitution statutes that apply, and that doesn't

25

change.

And Congress, in 1996, apparently codified ­­

So as the reading ­­ the plain reading of

the statute point (59)­­ with the government's burden of proof,

requires that the government demonstrate that, for

4

example, the medical services losses of the victim of

5

child pornography are caused by ­­ are the result of the

6

defendant's offense.

7

by adopting ­­ of 3664(e) and placing it as the

8

enforcement provision of each of the restitution

9

statutes that it created in 1996.

10

And that's what Congress intended

It codified Hughey.

And what the idea of contribution suggests

11

that convicted sex offenders across the country are

12

going to get together and see who pays what to whom.

13

That's not what Congress intended.

14

proceeding that requires a particularized,

individualized sentence based upon criminal conduct.

This is a sentencing

And that's what ­­ what the ­­ what Congress

17

solution is to say, Congress, make each defendant pay

A single judge, like Judge Davis, had one defendant.

He didn't have a defendant in Florida or

Maine or Oregon to see what that person's background

balanced two experts and the methodology that was

challenged and simply said, I find she was a victim, I

find that she was harmed.

But the government didn't meet its statutory

burden of proof in this case, and in many other cases,

15

there is losses proved.

between harm and loss.

And there's a difference

In this case, the district court did exactly

what the government wanted them to do:

evidence, listen to the evidence, look at the defendant
