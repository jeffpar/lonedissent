CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

in Case 12­9490, Navarette v. California.

5

Mr. Kleven.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R. KLEVEN,

7
8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS,
APPOINTED BY THIS COURT

9

MR. KLEVEN:

10

please the Court:

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

In this case, the Court should hold that

12

officers acting on anonymous tips must corroborate the

13

tips' assertions of illegal conduct, as well as the

14

identifying details before making a stop, whether that

15

tip involves erratic driving, illegal gun possession, or

16

any other allegation of misconduct.

17

Now, the State proposes that the reasonable

18

suspicion rule in­­ established in Terry v. Ohio, which

19

courts and law enforcement officials have been applying

20

now for more than 40 years, should be altered so that,

21

now, it applies as a sliding scale where the level of

22

suspicion varies depending on the nature of the crime

23

that an anonymous tipster claims someone has committed.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if the tip ­­ so

if the tip is, is this car is driving by and throwing

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

bombs out the window, okay, every ­­ you know, whatever,

2

500 yards, the police find the car, they have to wait

3

until they see the person actually throw a bomb out the

4

window themselves, before pulling them over?

5

MR. KLEVEN:

Well, Your Honor, in terms of

6

the reasonable suspicion, yes.

7

have is an anonymous tip and there is no ­­ they have no

8

way of corroborating any of the ­­ any of the innocent

9

details, except that they can identify the car, then,

10
11

If there ­­ if all they

yes, under ­­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So your answer is

12

yes, the car is going there, and he's throwing a bomb

13

out, and it goes off, but he has to wait till he sees

14

them throw out another bomb?

15

MR. KLEVEN:

Your Honor, under the

16

Florida­J.L., the Court has said that when they are

17

looking ­­ when all that they are able to corroborate

18

are obvious reasonably observable details, such as that,

19

then there is no basis for the Court to go beyond

20

that ­­ and

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that ­­ that

22

J.L. gave an example of an exception that the report is

23

somebody is carrying a bomb?

24
25

MR. KLEVEN:
Your Honor.

Well, there is that exception,

And in Florida­J.L, it said that it was

4
Alderson Reporting Company

1

not ­­ the Court said that it was not required on the

2

facts of that case to speculate about a situation where

3

such a serious danger ­­

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Throwing bombs doesn't

5

count, but carrying a bomb does, is that it?

6

throwing bombs that they weren't carrying?

7

MR. KLEVEN:

Were they

Your Honor, that would not make

8

a difference.

9

adjusting the reasonable suspicion standard, the Court

10
11

However, in this case, in terms of

should not address that.

The Court has never said ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Excuse me.

I'm sorry.

12

Could I ask you what you mean by an "anonymous tip"?

13

Suppose somebody calls up 911 and gives a name?

14

that make it not an anonymous tip?

15

MR. KLEVEN:

Does

Your Honor, technically, it

16

would not be, but in the circumstances here, I think it

17

should be treated as an anonymous tip because, again,

18

the name could be false when the tip first comes in.

19

it's corroborated in some way, then ­­

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

If

Well, how would you

21

corroborate it?

22

a name and gives an address?

23

necessary?

24

they could stop the vehicle, other than observing the

25

vehicle do something illegal?

Let's say the person calls up and gives
So what would be

What would the police have to do then before

5
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. KLEVEN:

Well again, if all they have is an

2

assertion by the ­­ by the tipster that this is the name

3

and the address, and if the officers can somehow, again,

4

by caller identification or some other method verify

5

that, in fact, that is the person so that, somewhere

6

down the line, that person will be ­­ will be held

7

accountable for a false tip, then it can be treated

8

differently.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, what if you

10

have caller ID.

I mean, you have one of these anonymous

11

flip phones, right?

12

You call up and say, I'm ­­ you know, John Smith, I've

13

seen this, and they look, there's the caller, there's

14

the number.

You can buy them, it's prepaid.

15

Then they can do it.

16

MR. KLEVEN:

No, Your Honor.

That would not­­ If all they

17

have is a number, then they are not going to be able to

18

use that as a basis for ­­

19
20
21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, isn't that all

caller ID gives you?
MR. KLEVEN:

Well, with caller ID, if they

22

are somehow able to verify, not just that this is coming

23

from this phone, but that, in fact, there's a particular

24

person there, if they can identify the location, that

25

sort of thing.

As the ­­ as the tip gets more and more

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

like the known informant in the Adams case, then the court­­

2

officers can take more solace in the fact that that

3

person is going to be able to be held responsible.

4

In Adams, of course, there's a situation

5

where there is a known informant who can be arrested

6

immediately if, in fact, the tip turns out to be false.

7

The problem with so many of these cases, with the 911

8

tape ­­ 911 caller, is that even if ­­ is that there's

9

not going to be any sort of accountability even if they

10

do manage to identify the person in terms of showing the

11

tip is false where the allegation, for example, is

12

weaving.

13

There's no way to prove that that ­­

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

If we transport the standard

15

that applies outside of the vehicle context to this

16

context, what would happen in this situation?

17

calls up and says, this is my name, this is my address

18

and it's ­­ it's not blocked by caller ID, so the 911

19

operator can see that that's the name, that's the

20

address.

21

A person

The person says, this guy ran me off the

22

road.

23

the vehicle for a while.

24

any ­­ they don't see any violation.

25

think, well, this guy must have lied.

The police find the vehicle.

They drive behind

They don't ­­ they don't see

7
Alderson Reporting Company

So then they

Official

1
2

So are they going to prosecute the guy for
calling ­­ calling that in?

3

MR. KLEVEN:

No, Your Honor, because still

4

they wouldn't be able to prosecute them because the fact

5

that the vehicle is now not weaving doesn't show that

6

they were ­­ that it was or was not weaving ­­

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean, your argument goes

8

well beyond.

9

anonymous tips, but it really goes well beyond anonymous

You're saying this has to do with

10

tips.

11

in, and what you're saying is that they really can never

12

stop a vehicle no matter what kind of a tip they get,

13

unless they see the vehicle committing an illegal act.

14

That's the argument.

15

It covers tips where you know exactly who called

MR. KLEVEN:

No, Your Honor.

I'm sorry.

16

No, I don't think it goes that far, Your Honor.

17

as the tip becomes ­­ as the tip contains more detail

18

and as the tipster becomes more accountable for a false

19

tip, again, getting more over toward the Adams v.

20

Kennedy, then, at some point, the anonymous tip would be

21

or that the tip ­­

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

I think

Well, give me an example of a

23

situation in which the police can pull somebody over

24

after receiving a tip without actually seeing the

25

vehicle commit an illegal act?

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. KLEVEN:

I think, Your Honor, in a

2

situation where the caller calls in, says I'm ­­ I've

3

been ­­ this car is driving erratically.

4

then says, I'm following the car.

5

such­and­such a location.

6

something else that's wrong.

The caller

Now, we're at

The vehicle has just done

7

And they continue to follow up to the point

8

where, okay, I can now see the ­­ the patrol car coming

9

up, again, where the tipster is putting his or her

10

credibility on the line and becomes more and more

11

accountable towards the Adams v. Kennedy known

12

informant, then if you add that together under the

13

totality of the circumstances, then you will have a

14

situation probably to do it.

15

I think it's going to be rare, and I think

16

it should be rare because it is so easy ­­ as the Court

17

has indicated, the Court has shown skepticism for

18

anonymous tips because the tipsters are able to harass

19

other people without running any risk of being held

20

accountable.

21

And it should be particularly skeptical in

22

the case of anonymous tips about erratic driving

23

because, with the ubiquitous cell phones, it's so easy

24

for somebody who's on the road, who's been annoyed by

25

somebody else, to just pull out the cell phone and call

9
Alderson Reporting Company

1

in a false tip.

2

And so ­­

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do we have any

4

indication that this is a serious problem?

5

tips?

The false

6

MR. KLEVEN:

7

evidence in the record.

8

concern that led the Court, in J.L., to refuse to adopt

9

the firearm exception, the concern that making it so

Well, there's no empirical
However, it was the same

10

easy for people to subject others to the harassment of

11

a ­­ of a stop and ­­ and potential ­­ potential search

12

concerned the Court enough that it denied ­­ it refused

13

to adopt the firearm exception.

14

And in this case, we have a firearm

15

exception ­­ we have an exception that's being requested

16

that's doctrinally the same as a firearm exception.

17

There is­­ there is no indication in the record that drunk

18

driving on its own, in totality, presents a more serious

19

threat to public safety than ­­ than firearms do.

20

In fact, it ­­

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, is that ­­ is

22

that true?

23

driving versus how many people dry­­die from firearms?

24
25

I mean, how many people die from drunk

MR. KLEVEN:

The most recent ­­ the most

recent statistics show a little more, about 11,000

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

people die from homicides by firearms, and it's usually

2

under 10,000 now that are driving ­­ dying by drunk

3

driving.

4

And in terms of public safety, approximately

5

two­thirds of the people who die as a result of drunk

6

driving are the drunk drivers themselves.

7

the overall threat to public safety is not as great when

8

you're talking about drunk driving as ­­ as with

9

firearms.

10

So, in fact,

And the Court indicated, in J.L., that it

11

was specifically concerned about the serious threat that

12

armed criminals pose to public safety, and, despite that

13

serious threat, they denied ­­ the Court denied the

14

firearms exception.

15

Now, what the ­­ excuse me.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I was just going to

17

say, we have held that the ­­ the standards are loosened

18

in the vehicle context because your expectation of

19

privacy is diminished when you're out on the road

20

driving along in ­­ in a vehicle.

21

pertinence?

22

MR. KLEVEN:

Does that have any

I don't think so in this case,

23

Your Honor, because even though it's diminished as

24

opposed to, for example, in the home, it's ­­ in J.L.,

25

of course, the person was on a public sidewalk; the

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

person was not in the home.

2

And in ­­ in Prouse, the Court talked about

3

the fact that, in modern day times, people ­­ a lot of

4

people will feel more of a sense of security, they'll

5

feel more privacy in a vehicle than they would out on

6

the street.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But in the context in which

8

we've approved sobriety checkpoints, why should we get

9

bent out of shape over this?

10

MR. KLEVEN:

Well, Your Honor, in the

11

sobriety checkpoint case, the Court has looked at the

12

intrusion and found that to be at the very rock bottom

13

in terms of intrusion, the fact that somebody is ­­

14

along with a number of other people, that they have to

15

submit to a brief stop, it has put that on the lowest ­­

16

on the lowest level.

17

And so it's a ­­ the Court has not approved

18

any situation where individual vehicles, as in this

19

case, are pulled over without reasonable suspicion that,

20

in fact, somebody in that vehicle is engaged in ­­ in

21

criminal activity.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but why is that an

23

important line?

24

individual automobile is pulled over?

25

MR. KLEVEN:

Why should we be more concerned when an

Well, because the ­­ the

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

intrusion is greater, Your Honor.

2

Martinez­Fuentes case and the Brignoni­Ponce case, the

3

Court talked about the very minimal intrusion of the

4

checkpoints, as opposed to ­­ and Prouse talks about

5

this also, that there is a serious intrusion when

6

somebody is pulled over.

7

And the

You have the activation of the emergency

8

lights, you have a siren, you're pulled over, possibly,

9

in a neighborhood where ­­ where you're known and people

10

see it, possibly out in the middle of a road in the

11

middle of the night as in the ­­ the Wells case.

12

either circumstance, it is a serious intrusion and one

13

that people are not going to take that lightly.

14

it's ­­ it's a different situation.

And in

So

15

And the Court, again, if they're going to be

16

pulling over individual cars, signaling them out for ­­

17

for stops which could, under the Court's rules, again,

18

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

don't have an absolute rule with respect to requiring

23

independent corroboration of the actual illegal conduct.

5

and look at what failure there is in the logic of the

6

California court below.

7

8

legitimate tipster will tell you what the vehicle looks

9

like and its license plate or enough information so it

Why don't we just stick to our general

It ­­ it looked at the quality

can be identified.
It looked at the caller actually witnessing

12

the event and giving you enough detail to know that it's

13

not a legal conclusion, but an actual event that

14

suggests recklessness, and a corroboration of the ­­ of

15

the details given by the tipster.

And that's

exactly what the court was looking at in Florida J.L.­­v. J.L.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that's just not

21

true in Florida v. J.L. because the individual didn't

22

match the description completely, and there were two or

23

three individuals there, not just one, and so ­­ and

need to reach that question in J.L.

4
5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I understand it, but we're

interested in a hypothetical.

6

MR. KLEVEN:

Right.

Your Honor, I believe

7

that, again, I don't know what particular doctrine the

8

9

the Court could find some ­­ some doctrine that would

10

allow it, in that circumstance, to find it.

But it shouldn't be ­­ it shouldn't be

moving toward the sliding scale element in ­­ that ­­

13

that we're talking about.

JUSTICE BREYER:

What about this:

In J.L.,

see the point.
MR. KLEVEN:

Right.

But the question is,

12

Your Honor, is the person inebriated or not, to take

the ­­ the State's best example.

14

issue, that is a concealed element of criminal behavior,

15

unless the person is actually driving erratically.

16

And that ­­ that

If the person is driving erratically when

17

the officers appear, then there's no Fourth Amendment

18

issue, and it's clear that they have either reasonable

19

suspicion or probable cause to pull over the vehicle.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It seems to me you're

21

willing to accept our allowing ­­ or allowing the police

22

to stop the car with the atom bomb and even allowing the

the Court might decide to address it without even

The Court postulated, in Florida v. J.L., a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

But ­­ that's why I asked

2

you, and I pressed the point a little bit, because in

3

the beginning of your brief, it says that the anonymous

4

tip, what did you say, indicated that a Ford F­150

5

pickup truck had run someone off the road.

6

MR. KLEVEN:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's right.
Now, maybe you do have to be

8

known specially whether the person's drunk or not, but

9

you don't have to have some special knowledge of

10

anything concealed to know if somebody has run somebody

11

off the road.

12
13

MR. KLEVEN:

But, Your Honor, the ­­ the

idea of running off the road is concealed ­­

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Even if the person weren't

15

drunk, I think it's illegal to run someone else off the

16

road.

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. KLEVEN:

19

I'm not disagreeing with Your

Honor.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. KLEVEN:

No.
What I'm saying is that, unless

22

the person is still driving erratically by the time that

23

the officers arrive, then that activity is concealed in

24

the same way that the question of whether J.L. had a gun

25

or not was concealed.

You can't ­­ the officers can't

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

see it, and, therefore, there's no reason to treat this

2

case any differently than the case in J.L.

3

They have to be able to see something like

4

erratic driving or something else, in order to be able

5

to corroborate that.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I assume you would ­­

7

you would also say, to tie it into Justice Breyer's

8

question, you would also say that that tip, "Somebody

9

ran me off the road," would not justify the court ­­ the

10

police in stopping the car, just to make sure that this

11

car was not the one that drove the guy off the road,

12

right?

13

MR. KLEVEN:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's right, Your Honor.
Never mind drunkenness.

15

The tip doesn't say anything about drunkenness.

16

said, this car drove me off the road.

police could not follow that car, pull him over, and ­­

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY M.K. LAURENCE

13

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. LAURENCE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
A police officer may act on an anonymous tip

14

that reports reckless or drunk driving by immediately

15

stopping the vehicle, without waiting to personally

16

observe dangerous driving that could threaten others.

17

An officer can reasonably rely on such a tip

18

because the importance of the governmental interest in

19

protecting the public from the ongoing and immediate

20

threat of drunk driving outweighs the minimal intrusion

21

of a traffic stop.

22

Now, Petitioners argue that ­­ ­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is every reckless

driving drunk driving?
MR. LAURENCE:

Not every reckless driving is

4

drunk driving.

5

reasonable suspicion that the person may be drunk, and

6

that's sufficient for the stop in this case.

7

But a report of reckless driving gives

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How about if somebody

8

just calls and says, X vehicle is driving recklessly,

9

says no more, doesn't describe how, doesn't give you any

10

details as to how they know it.

11

reasonable suspicion?

12

MR. LAURENCE:

Is that enough for

I would say that the term

13

"reckless" is.

14

driving is something that's intimately familiar to the

15

average citizen.

16

and make a report, when they use the language

17

"reckless," that has meaning.

18

that poses an ongoing threat to the public.

19

And the reason I say that is because

And when a citizen is going to call in

MR. LAURENCE:

synonymous, but I would say that one is the indicator of

the other because while you can ­­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
speeding?

Why?

How about

There's plenty of people who speed regularly.

MR. LAURENCE:

I would say a report of

speeding is not sufficient to have reasonable suspicion.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Isn't that reckless

7

behavior?

8

mother, who can't drive above 50, thinks that, when I go

9

51, that I'm speeding and reckless.

10

So how do you know someone who calls ­­ my

MR. LAURENCE:

I would say that, once again,

11

the public has lots of familiarity with driving, and

12

they can recognize the difference between poor driving

13

and reckless driving, or something, or drunk driving.

14

And when people are going to pick up the phone and make

15

that call to 911, they're doing so because they perceive

16

a danger on the roadway.

17

And I think while the statistics are sparse

18

on this, the footnote 2 in the government's brief is

19

particularly helpful in this regard, in that they note

20

that for calls that are made to 911 centers for ­­ that

21

are tracked by the States, between 25 and 50 percent of

22

those calls result in arrests.

23

that the public knows what they see when they make these

24

calls.

25

And what that shows is

This is a far ­­

30
Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And ­­ and between the,

2

what, 50 and 75 percent, they've stopped people without

3

just cause.

4

MR. LAURENCE:

Yes, but we are talking about

5

reasonable suspicion.

6

or probability.

7
8
9

So it doesn't require certainty

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Or they've ­­ they've

troubled people who shouldn't have been troubled.
MR. LAURENCE:

That is correct.

And that is

10

always a possibility in the reasonable suspicion

11

context.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What ­­ what if the

13

call is ­­ you know, I'm driving, this guy just drove by

14

me, I looked over, he didn't have his seatbelt on.

15

mean, can the police pull that guy over?

16

MR. LAURENCE:

I

No, I don't believe that

17

would be sufficient to pull him over because you don't

18

have any governmental ­­ you don't have a threat to

19

public safety in that context.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well yeah, there are laws

21

against driving without a seatbelt because that protects

22

people's lives.

23

MR. LAURENCE:

Certainly, there are laws,

24

and the officer, I guess, would have reasonable

25

suspicion that there is a traffic violation, but I don't

31
Alderson Reporting Company

about the report of the car, report of the location,

5

knowledge is accurate, as opposed to a bare tip when

look to predicted details.

correctly, as long as you can identify the car, you need

MR. LAURENCE:

Maybe

Well, I believe that was

11

something that was indicated in Hensley.

12

looked to the nature of the offense in deciding whether

13

or not the officer had reasonable suspicion at the

14

inception in making that stop for a crime that had

15

occurred two weeks earlier.

This Court

And it didn't ­­ it declined to consider

17

whether or not that would be sufficient for a

into account, in determining whether or not they could

make that stop, that's a recognition that balancing does

21

play some role.

22

But in taking the seriousness of the crime

12

And that's enough to stop them.

MR. LAURENCE:

Well, I would say ­­ I would

13

say that, in this case, it is enough.

14

it's more than just driving irresponsibly.

15

somebody off the road reflects that they're incapable of

safety threat to other people, and when you're dealing

MR. LAURENCE:

Mr. Laurence, if the police had followed this man for

half an hour and seen no other signs of erratic

2

driving and nobody can drunk drive ­­ can drive drunk

3

for half an hour without swerving, without doing

4

something else.

5

So they could still have stopped the car?

6

MR. LAURENCE:

I think there may be a point

7

where the threat to public safety would suggest that the

8

reasonable suspicion is dissipated in that context.

9

so after ­­ after 50 miles ­­

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And

Well, I thought you were

saying as long as somebody had ­­ had given an account

enough to stop him.

17

now.

18

MR. LAURENCE:

It doesn't matter what he's doing

Well, I believe that the

threat to public safety plays a role in the balance.

20

And so if that's dissipated, then at that point, you

21

have ­­ the ­­ the reliability of the tip that you're

relying on is not as significant.

When you have the threat to public safety balanced in

and some driving violations that don't.

9

National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration and

NHTSA, the

10

other organizations, do keep track of what kinds of

11

behavior are associated with drunkenness.

12

And the Court, in this case, of course,

13

looked at the particular behavior and said, is this

14

really a reckless driving behavior, the kind of behavior

15

that poses this imminent danger?

16

that courts would need to draw, but the courts that are

MS. KOVNER:

The reasonableness of the

I think that's true, Your

14

Honor, and we actually think and ­­ you know, we argued

15

in our brief that there is reasonable suspicion here.

16

When an informant gives a basis for knowledge, you have

17

reason to think they are an eyewitness.

18

But the Court has also recognized that there

19

are certain dangers on the roadway that allow

20

intrusions, even when we might not otherwise allow them.

21

So, for instance, in the Sitz case, the Court said drunk

22

that drunk driving is such a great danger that we're

23

going to allow even random stops of vehicles to detect

24

drunk drivers.

are certain driving behaviors that are so dangerous

class of people who are going to have the relevant

19

knowledge is almost exclusively eyewitnesses.

20

also have a few people who have seen the person's car

21

and happen to know what direction they're headed in, but

22

for the most part, we're talking about a very narrow

23

class of individuals that are largely going to be

24

eyewitnesses to this person's driving on the road.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You may

No, I'm talking

about the concern that you want to have the police pull

2

over people that you don't like, where you know

3

somebody's got something bad in the car, and you don't

4

like it, and so you're going to take advantage of the

5

fact that the police don't have to observe anything, and

6

yet, you can still get them to pull over this person.

7

MS. KOVNER:

So somebody who's malicious,

8

who's a prankster, is still going to have this kind of

9

specialized knowledge, and that's not something a

10

malicious prankster is necessarily going to have.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I ­­

Why is that different

12

from the knowledge in J.L., that they were three young

13

men, and they were described, and the caller said, "The

14

one with the gun is the one with the plaid shirt."

15

of that was corroborated by the police, and yet, we held

16

that that was no indication that a crime had been

17

committed.

MS. KOVNER:

All

Your Honor, I think the

19

critical thing that's present here that wasn't present

20

in J.L. is the basis for knowledge.

21

that Justice Breyer read signals, we're talking there

22

about concealed criminal activity, and the Court pointed

out in that case there's nothing in the tip that signals

how the informant knows this person had a gun.

MS. KOVNER:

Your Honor, officers could

7

follow the car, and if they do, they may witness a

8

subsequent dangerous behavior that could justify pulling

9

over the car.

The problem is that the subsequent

10

dangerous behavior they may observe may be the car

11

swerving into another lane and hitting another vehicle.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That is so remote.

I mean,

13

it seems to me you're asking us to adopt a broad rule

14

that is contrary to what we normally do for searches and

15

seizures because, now and then, it would seem, to me,

very rarely, before the police can stop the drunk

driver, he kills somebody.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R. KLEVEN,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS,
APPOINTED BY THIS COURT
MR. KLEVEN:

In this case, we're talking

14

about a single uncorroborated tip of reckless driving.

15

After that single incident, the car ­­ the truck went

16

for approximately 19 miles with no indication of any

17

other problem and then was followed for up to 5 miles by

18

the police officers, again, with no indication of any

19

erratic driving or any other violation that would have

20

been a reason for pulling him over immediately.

21

There's no reason to believe that the driver

22

of this truck presented any kind of danger about being

23

about to lose control, which is the argument that the

24

State is relying on, and the Federal government, and

25

neither one of them came up with any anecdote, even,

59
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

where that actually occurred, much less any statistics

2

that show that that is a serious problem, of people

3

losing control while they're being under surveillance by

4

the police officers.

5

This case is even farther away from the bomb

6

situation than J.L. was.

7

was armed, who could have pulled out a gun and started

8

firing at any moment.

9

there's no indication of any ongoing risk to the public.

10

I don't think ­­ I don't know that there's a good answer

11

to the bomb question.

12

In J.L., you had a person who

Here, you have something where

22

kidnapping situation.

5

6

enough to be on that side of the line.

7

You either have to go all the way, or you

8

have to draw a line, and if you're going to draw a line,

9

I would like to know where the line is.

10

MR. KLEVEN:

Well, Your Honor, except I

there's a line someplace, then, really, I think you need

22

to tell us where the line is.

Your Honor, I think the line is

24

too ­­ too inebriated to be driving properly, and police
