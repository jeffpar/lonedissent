CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

5

McCullen v. Coakley.

6

Mr. Rienzi.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK L. RIENZI

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. RIENZI:

10

please the Court:

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

This Court has held that the public

12

sidewalks are a natural and proper place for free

13

citizens to exchange information and ideas, and for that

14

reason the Court has held that public sidewalks occupy a

15

special position in First Amendment analysis.

16

If the Massachusetts law at issue here makes

17

it a crime to enter onto certain public sidewalks, even

18

for the purpose of peaceful conversation, or

19

leafletting, the law applies at abortion clinics

20

throughout the State on every hour of every day that

21

they are open, regardless of the circumstances.

22

Massachusetts asked this Court to uphold

23

that statute under the time, place, and manner test, but

24

the law fails each aspect of that test.

25

I would like to begin with narrow tailoring.

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

The State says the law is necessary to protect its

2

interests in preventing obstruction and congestion.

3

the law is not narrowly tailored to those interests for

4

three reasons:

5

whether there's any threat of obstruction or congestion

6

at all, even when the sidewalks are entirely open and

7

empty.

8
9

But

First, the law applies regardless of

her counseling early in the morning on Tuesdays and

10

Wednesdays beginning at 7:00 in the morning.

12

counseling.

14

all alone.

15

A statute that makes it illegal for

16

Mrs. McCullen or Mrs. Clark to engage in peaceful,

17

consensual conversation on a public sidewalk for fear of

18

obstruction and congestion is not narrowly tailored.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Rienzi, the problem

20

that the State faced is it doesn't know ­­ and it has a

21

history, there was a considerable history of

22

disturbances and blocking the entrance, and it doesn't

23

know in advance who are the well­behaved people and who

24

are the people who won't behave well.

25

the disturbance occurs, it's too late.

4
Alderson Reporting Company

So ­­ and after

Official

1

So the State is trying to say, We want to

2

make sure that the entrance is not blocked, and the only

3

way we can do that is to have a rule that applies to

4

everyone.

5

who will be well behaved and who will be disruptive.

6

We can't ­­ we can't screen people to know

MR. RIENZI:

So I think the State is simply

7

wrong about that fact for several reasons.

8

many tools that the State either has in its current

9

toolbox or could enact that would deal with that

10
11

There are

concern.
And if I may back up for a second, I think

12

there are really two different interests that the State

13

asserts when it makes that argument, Justice Ginsburg.

14

First, they say that there are actual deliberate bad

15

actors.

16

State claims have deliberately violated the law and

17

blocked the door and interfered with access.

18

All right.

There are some people whom the

And then secondly, the State says there is

19

also some circumstances where there are enough people on

20

the sidewalk that even lawful, consensual conversation

21

might accidentally block a door.

22

actually two quite different interests, but there are

23

tools in the toolbox to deal with both of them.

24
25

I think those are

For example, Section E of this statute makes
it illegal to impede, block, obstruct or even hinder

5
Alderson Reporting Company

1

somebody's access to the clinics.

2

the statute is not challenged here and never has been.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that section of

You know, I should probably

4

ask this of the other side, and I will, but do you

5

happen to know when was the last time that Massachusetts

6

prosecuted somebody for obstructing entrance to an

7

abortion clinic?

8
9

MR. RIENZI:

So I believe the last cite in

the record that I'm aware of is, as of 1997, there was a

10

decision in a previous injunction case against people

11

who had been adjudicated to have broken rules.

12

a 1997 case on that.

13

There is

To my knowledge, they've never brought a

14

case, for example, under the Federal FACE law, which has

15

been in existence for 20 years.

16
17
18
19
20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So there have been laws

against obstruction during this entire period, right?
MR. RIENZI:

There have been laws against

obstruction the entire time.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

And you say that only once,

21

in 1997, that was the last time a prosecution was

22

brought.

23

MR. RIENZI:

And that was an injunction

24

against prior bad actors.

25

prosecution or a Section E prosecution.

That was not a FACE

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You are not taking the

2

position that 1997 was the last time an entrance was

3

obstructed or that the police were called to open access

4

to a clinic?

5

time it happened was 1997?

6
7
8
9
10

Are you taking that position that the last

MR. RIENZI:

I frankly don't ­­ I couldn't

say that I know the last time it happened.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But you do know that in

the record there were more examples?
MR. RIENZI:

I know that in the record there

11

was testimony claiming that that happened.

12

is simply that the State has tools that are deliberately

13

designed to deal with that.

14

My argument

And so the United States ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Rienzi, the State says,

15

of that particular tool, that it's a hard thing to

16

prosecute because you have to show intent, and there is

17

a lot of obstruction and interference that goes on

18

naturally just because there are a lot of people around.

19

So that is an insufficient tool is what the State

20

argues.

21

MR. RIENZI:

Yes.

And so to the extent,

22

what the State is saying ­­ to the extent the State is

23

claiming that there are deliberate bad actors

24

deliberately blocking the door, I don't think that's a

25

very persuasive argument.

There are police on the

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

scene, and if the police say, Get out of the doorway,

2

either the person moves in which case there is not a

3

problem anymore, or they don't, in which case, intent is

4

pretty clear.

5

Amicus United States has prosecuted, I think

6

more than 45 cases and gotten more than 70 convictions

7

under that statute.

8
9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And sometimes there are

those bad actors, but probably more often it's just a

10

function of there are just lots of people, and they,

11

your clients and all of ­­ all of them want to be as

12

close as possible to the site, and that that naturally

13

leads to an interference with normal access.

14

MR. RIENZI:

And so I agree that's the

15

second part of the State's argument.

16

law is narrowly tailored to that concern, in two

17

respects.

18

I don't think this

One, the law applies ­­ you know, the

19

evidence in the case is that the crowds that the State

20

is concerned about happened essentially at one clinic,

21

one day, one time ­­ Saturday mornings in Boston ­­ and

22

when they happen, there are video cameras rolling and

23

police officers present.

24
25

And there is no reason to believe the police
can't simply say, Move out of the doorway.

8

And if

1

someone is in front of the doorway, they certainly

should do that.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Does the record show how

many clinics in the State are covered by the law?
MR. RIENZI:

I believe there are 11 or 12

clinics in the State.

abortion clinics they fall within statutory definitions.

How far do you want to go
Would you want to concede this

10

point that imagine the State has two groups of people

11

12

wrong.

13

to do it.

And the second group feels, We absolutely want

14

And everyone is in a fragile state of mind,

to sort of shout as loud as you could at the other,

And the other says, Please leave

And we are not saying which group is which;

Does the State have the right, in your

21

opinion, to say, It's tough to referee this, we see the

22

potential for real harm on one side or the other, so

23

don't think the concept that ­­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So protestors like the

one we had in the Schneider case at a funeral of a

veteran can go right up to the public sidewalk outside

25

out the leaflets that they did, talking about that

veteran in the ways that they did?

That's okay by you.

So ­­ so, a couple points about

One I think ­­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There was no evidence

5

there that they were ­­ that they were disruptive.

6

were just expressing their First Amendment rights.

7

MR. RIENZI:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

11

They

So I think that that ­­
But there was the

potential for disruption because of the strong
sentiments around that.
MR. RIENZI:

Agreed.

I think a statute that

12

worked the way the one ­­ this one does here, that would

13

make it illegal to even engage in peaceful conversation

14

on sidewalks near a church or near a funeral or near

15

just about anything else, I think clearly is not

16

permitted by the First Amendment.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In Schneider, they were

18

held not so far back that their shouts and protests

19

couldn't be heard.

20

still be heard ­­

Isn't that the case?

JUSTICE BREYER:

Do you see now why I am

2

trying to narrow it?

3

I thought it was pretty important that the demonstrators

4

were behind a hill somewhere and the police restricted

5

where they can go.

6

laws, and I thought that's important, because maybe it

7

would have come out differently.

8

argue that, I could.

9

Because in my case, in Schneider,

Many States have enacted similar

I mean, you could

So I'm trying to narrow it.

I'm trying to

10

see to what extent do I have to look at this particular

11

set of facts, in which case we are into the hearings,

12

et cetera; and to what extent is there a matter of very

13

broad principle here, and any help you can give me on

14

that would be appreciated.

15

MR. RIENZI:

So the matter of very broad

16

principle is that a law that makes it illegal to even

17

engage in consensual conversation, quiet conversation,

18

on a public sidewalk, an act that makes that a criminal

19

act for which Mrs. McCullen can go to prison, I think,

20

is not permissible under the First Amendment.

21

If you compare it to, for example, the

22

Federal military funeral protest law, that law is

23

specifically drawn to acts that disrupt the peace and

24

good order of the funeral, and I think that is

25

different.

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But are you saying that you

2

could not do an act that instead just says, look, it's a

3

little bit too hard to figure out what and what does not

4

disrupt peace and order, so we're just going to say

5

25 feet around a funeral, or 25 feet around any

6

facility, that that's never permissible?

7

MR. RIENZI:

So, generally speaking, I think

8

any law like that runs into a big First Amendment

9

problem of even eliminating peaceful, consensual

10

conversation that doesn't disrupt anything.

11

Court's past First Amendment decisions have said that

12

precision of regulation is required.

13

And this

One difference, if it's a rule around any

14

facility or a rule around all funerals, for example, is

15

that ­­ that there isn't nearly as much distortion of

16

the marketplace of ideas as happens when you do what

17

Massachusetts did here, which is pick ­­

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, for example, I was

19

intrigued by one of the examples that you gave in your

20

own brief, which you said slaughterhouses.

21

say, that there are animal rights activists, and this is

22

easy to imagine, who try to interfere with access in and

23

out of slaughterhouses.

24

that says there's a ton of interference, it's preventing

25

the operation of these facilities, employees can't get

So, let's

And a State passes a regulation

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in, suppliers can't get in, slaughterhouses are leaving

2

the State because of this problem, and so we're just

3

going to set up a zone and let's call it 30 feet,

4

because it's very hard to enforce anything else.

5

I guess my reaction to that hypothetical ­­

6

you ­­ you must have used it for me to say, oh, that's

7

terrible.

8

what's wrong with that?

9

back.

But my reaction, my intuition was kind of
Just have everybody take a step

10

So what is wrong with that?

11

MR. RIENZI:

12

couple of things.

13

require precision of regulation.

14

example, against groups and individuals like Madsen and

15

Schenck, for example, an injunction against groups and

16

individuals who have interfered with access, keeping

17

them back, I think that's perfectly permissible.

18

take no issue with that type of solution.

19

So what's wrong with that is a
One, again, this Court's decisions
So an injunction, for

We

It's the generally applicable statute,

20

right, that's tied to just one particular

21

often­protested event that gives the State enormous

22

power to interfere with the marketplace of ideas.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

one of the examples that

24

is given in one of the amicus briefs in this case, and

25

they ­­ they provide a lot of background, is a State law

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that creates a buffer zone around every fraternal lodge.

2

What would you say about that?

3

MR. RIENZI:

I think it is difficult to

4

imagine the government interest to ­­ well, first, I

5

guess, I don't know the particulars of that law and what

6

it ­­ what it restricts.

7

conversation on public sidewalks anyplace there's a

8

fraternal lodge, I would say that ­­ that should not be

9

permissible under the First Amendment.

If it restricts peaceful

10

I think, generally speaking, the idea of the

11

government picking one particular item and saying, well,

12

around this, suddenly the character of the public forum

13

changes from a place where people can have peaceful,

14

consensual conversations to a place where we will

15

imprison them for doing that, I think that's a dramatic

16

restriction of First Amendment rights.

17

I think if there is a particular group or

18

individual who keeps interfering with the fraternal

19

order, of course, you can get an injunction against that

20

type of behavior, but I don't think the State can say

21

3

are great, but there are people who really want to make

5

one­to­one contact with the truck drivers, with the

6

employees, whoever.

7

And ­­ you

But ­­ but you say ­­ you know, we have to

8

let whatever interference goes on, even if there's a

9

record of ­­ of real obstruction, of real interference

10

with the operation of the facility, in order to allow

11

that to happen.

12

that's pretty hard.

13

And I guess I think that that's ­­

MR. RIENZI:

To be clear, Your Honor, I'm

14

not saying the government has to let it go on.

15

saying the government has tools that are better drawn to

16

it than eliminating even the peaceful, consensual

17

conversation.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm

But suppose ­­ and this is

19

still Justice Kagan's question ­­ suppose it were a

given, assume that those laws just did not work.

Could

Now, this is a hypothetical that I'm sure

MR. RIENZI:

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The laws simply do not ­­

reference to obstruction and blocking entrance, simply

4

do not work.

5

MR. RIENZI:

If the laws simply do not work,

6

I think perhaps the government could come in and make a

7

case that it has a compelling interest and that this is

8

the least restrictive means of doing it.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So that ­­ now, at

10

this point ­­ that was a better way of getting what I

11

was trying to get at.

12

let's look at the narrow part of the case, and let's

13

assume that the Colorado case is right.

14

particular restriction is more a restrictive than

15

Colorado in two important respects, which you've gone

16

into.

17

Just assume that there is ­­

And this

Now, the reason that they did that is they

18

had hearings in Massachusetts, and they discovered that

20

what are we supposed to do?

21

look at ­­ as long as those hearings are ­­ are

22

legitimate hearings and they have good explanation on

23

something like whether the zone is 8 feet and consensual

24

an intent on such matters, particularly when people are,

13

in good faith, they're trying to explain it, and it's

14

another thing to actually stop the congestion and to

15

protect the interests of the woman who wants to have the

abortion, may be in a fragile state of mind, and this

kind of thing could interfere with her health, et

side.

I want you to explain

So the constitutional narrow

last point, Your Honor.

2

that the ­­ the inability to speak with people close to

3

the clinic has a dramatic effect on the Petitioners'

4

ability to reach their audience.

5

to be walking from the same side of the zone that you're

6

standing on, you may have a shot.

7

The evidence in this record is

So if someone happens

Now, the clinic still has the space in front

of the clinic to talk to people, which you don't, but

you may have a shot if you're on the right spot.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And if you know they're

going to the clinic.

12

MR. RIENZI:

And if you can identify the

13

audience early enough.

But, for example, places like

14

Worcester and Springfield, where essentially the only

15

chance to reach the audience is by standing on the

16

public sidewalk and waving a leaflet as they drive

17

through the driveway entrance.

18

If you have to stand 35 feet back and do

19

that, the evidence here shows there's essentially zero

20

chance to reach that audience.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So it is ­­

But isn't that more a

function that they just have a private parking lot?

23

even if this law didn't exist, you actually couldn't

8

MR. RIENZI:

The term is "scope of

Scope of employment within this statute

So the Attorney General says

it's more than just getting to work and leaving work.
It says it's just doing their jobs.
First, I don't believe ­­ I don't believe

12

that they have the authority to do that; in other words,

13

I don't think they could go arrest somebody who happened

14

to speak about abortion when they work for an abortion

15

clinic.

16

They have an absolute statutory defense.

But even if they could limit it to just

17

doing their job, you end up with the problem that the

18

Ninth Circuit sought in the Hoyt case, which is if the

19

clinic is allowed to use that sidewalk, even just to

20

say, "good morning, may I help you into the clinic," and

21

the government says that's a valid use of our public

22

sidewalks, but the State says Mrs. McCullen will go to

23

prison if she goes on that sidewalk and says, "good

24

morning, may I offer you an alternative?"

25

As the Ninth Circuit panel said, that's

26
Alderson Reporting Company

indubitably content­based.
The government doesn't get to decide that

6

If I'm going down that sidewalk

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

the Attorney General's regulation with respect to

8

employees of the clinic in a way made this even more

content­based because there was a prohibition on

discussing the ­­ the abortion procedure?
MR. RIENZI:

I ­­ I agree.

That's one of

12

the reasons that the interpretation is flagrantly

13

unconstitutional.

14

people who work for Planned Parenthood, we won't arrest

15

you when you talk on the sidewalk unless you talk about

abortion, right?

17

arrest you.

MS. MILLER:

Well, again, experience showed

14

that some amount of space around the buffer zones ­­

15

around the facilities needed to be open.

16

simply a question of looking at past experience, at the

17

prior injunctions, for example, Your Honor.

18

So then it was

For example, in Planned Parenthood v. Bell,

19

which is cited at page 2 of our brief, there was

20

actually a 50­foot buffer zone imposed by a district

21

court judge in Massachusetts.

22

Madsen and Schenk, that 36­foot buffer zones were

23

acceptable in ­­ when you were being responsive to that

kind of problem; and we knew that a 15­foot buffer zone

25

would be acceptable if responding to a similar kind of

problem.

2

So at some point or another, the ­­ the

to be created, and it chose 35 feet as a reasonable

response, a reasonable amount of space around the

So I think ­­ I think, for

20

around circuses and conventions is the idea that there

21

is massing of people that prevents the orderly ingress

22

and egress to and from the facilities.

23

What the State was dealing with here was not

24

an isolated incident, but the State had 14, 15 years of

25

history of the massing.

They had tried other things.

Secondly, here, the police officers

19

Well, if you know them all and if they're congregating

21

should go to court and get an injunction and say, stay

22

out of the doors.

23

That's their testimony.

They know them all.

Until they do that, the claim that they have

24
