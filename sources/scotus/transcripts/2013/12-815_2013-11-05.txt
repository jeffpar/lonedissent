ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SIMEONE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The IUB's arguments here would transform

12

Younger abstention from the exception into the rule for

13

State agency adjudications.

14

decisions, even on issues of Federal law, would be

15

subject to challenge only in State court.

16

Virtually, all State agency

There's no basis for that broad rule in this

17

Court's decisions.

18

traditional principle going back to the time of the

19

framing that Federal courts sitting in equity shouldn't

20

intrude on State criminal cases.

21

Younger abstention began with the

This Court's decisions have, of course,

22

expanded Younger slightly beyond criminal cases.

23

24

Younger to civil enforcement actions in aid of State

25

criminal laws.

Alderson Reporting Company

In

In Middlesex County, in Dayton, the Court

2

extended Younger to administrative disciplinary actions.

3

But all of these cases are still coercive civil

4

enforcement actions, where the State's enforcement

5

interests are similar to those in criminal cases.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, one of the

7

problems I have is I don't know how to define

8

"coercive."

9

are plenty of examples in the brief where some courts

The line seems very hard to draw.

There

10

have said this kind of proceeding is coercive and that

11

kind is not.

So ­­

12

MR. SIMEONE:

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes, Your Honor.
­­ is it ­­ is it

14

worthwhile using that distinction at all?

15

be thinking about going back to basic principles and

16

doing something like the Second Circuit does, which is

17

to say it's a sovereign interest, rather than a personal

18

interest?

19

MR. SIMEONE:

Or should we

Your Honor, we've argued that

20

there is no magic to the ­­ to the word "coercive."

21

Coercive is a sort of shorthand that the lower courts

22

have used to mean coercive in the ways that this Court's

23

Younger decisions are coercive.

24
25

So I think the question of how far this
Court has extended Younger is really the heart of this

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

case, as opposed to sort of what is the meaning of the

2

word "coercive."

3

Court started with criminal cases, and it extended that

4

principle somewhat in Huffman and Moore and Trainor.

And I think, as I was saying, the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Those were when most of

them involved State proceedings.
MR. SIMEONE:

Yes.

There's ­­ they're ­­

8

but they're a specific kind of State enforcement action.

9

In each of those cases, this Court held that the State

10

enforcement action was in aid of criminal law.

11

a small extension of the traditional principle that

12

courts sitting in equity don't intrude on State criminal

13

cases.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So it's

But then we went further

in Pennzoil and in New Orleans ­­ well, perhaps not.
MR. SIMEONE:

Yes, the Court went further in

17

a couple of different directions, and I want to try to

18

address them separately, if I may.

The first direction is, really, the Dayton

MR. SIMEONE:

That's exactly right, Your

Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Has the FCC had a

proceeding to resolve it?
MR. SIMEONE:

Yes, although the FCC is

8

surprisingly adept at not resolving the issue in the

9

proceedings that it holds to resolve the issue.

So, in

10

fact, the FCC had a proceeding pending before it at the

11

time that this case was before the IUB, in which Sprint

12

expected that the ­­ that the FCC would resolve this

13

issue.

14

What the FCC did was resolve the issue of

15

what inter­carrier compensation regime applies going

16

forward, but it didn't address these calls that have

17

already occurred.

18

of telecommunications law now.

So this is a sort of strange corner

Going forward, the FCC has applied specific

3

in front of the FCC on this ­­ on this question.

4

MR. SIMEONE:

And the Federal judge

We ­­ we strongly urged the

5

IUB not to address these issues of Federal law.

6

IUB, I think, was frustrated with the FCC, which had not

7

implemented the relevant provisions of Federal law, and

8

the IUB reached out to make decisions on Federal law.

9

And all we're saying in this case is that

10

we ­­ we think that we ought to be able to challenge

11

those decisions that the IUB made as to what's an

12

information service, what's a telecommunications

13

service.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, you could.

The

You

15

could challenge it in the State court or this Court

16

and ­­ eventually, but there's a proceeding going on in

17

the State court, and there's a review ­­ State review

18

attached to that.

19

And you're ­­ you're saying we can cut off

20

this administrative process that ends in State review.

21

We could cut it off and go to the Federal court.

22

MR. SIMEONE:

To be clear, Your Honor, we

23

actually aren't seeking to enjoin any proceeding in the

24

State.

25

were required to by Eighth Circuit law.

We filed the action in State court because we

up more than just this ­­ the question of these ­­ these

6

charges.

7

MR. SIMEONE:

Yes, Your Honor.

This

8

could ­­ this is a situation quite comparable to the

9

England case.

In the England case, the ­­ the Federal

10

court plaintiffs thought that they were required to go

11

to State court with their Federal law issues.

12

And this Court said that they didn't have to

13

14

law issues.

15

Eighth Circuit rule is that, if you don't go to State

We said to the

issues in abeyance for 2 years while the abstention

When ­­ when the

10

Federal abstention issues were decided by the Eighth

11

Circuit, incorrectly, we think, the State court decided

12

to go forward.

13

But our ­­ our argument here is that in a

14

system of concurrent jurisdiction, where we have the

15

right to be in Federal court, to get review of our

Federal law issues, the fact that we were forced by

Eighth Circuit law to go to State court, too, shouldn't

MR. SIMEONE:

don't think it would be Burford because the State

10

doesn't argue that there's a complex regulatory regime

11

here of the sort that's covered by Burford.

12

What we think is that, if this were still

13

before the IUB, that would really take us back to our

14

main argument here in this case.

15

neither the State court proceeding, nor the IUB

16

proceeding, was the kind of civil enforcement action to

17

which this Court has extended Younger.

Our argument is that

18

So even if we'd filed in Federal court at

19

the time that proceeding was still pending before the

20

IUB, we think that Younger still shouldn't apply.

21

here, there's an additional reason why it shouldn't

22

apply.

23

But

We waited for the IUB proceeding to

24

conclude.

25

that Windstream wanted us to pay.

And, by the way, we then paid the invoices

11
Alderson Reporting Company

There's ­­ there's

Official

1

nothing further that we could be obliged to do here.

2

We've already paid.

3

But the ­­ but the additional reason why we

4

think we would ­­ we should prevail here really goes to

5

the issue that this Court reserved in NOPSI.

6

NOPSI, the Court assumed, without deciding, that the

7

agency proceeding and the State court review of the

8

agency proceeding were a unitary proceeding.

9

that those proceedings should only be treated as unitary

So in

We think

10

in situations where the State interests at the two

11

levels are similar.

12

So in Burford, to go back to your question,

13

Your Honor, in Burford, the State appellate court was

14

participating in the regulatory process with the State

15

agency.

16

unitary proceeding.

17

And, of course, this Court treated that as a

In this case, the State court proceeding, as

18

the IUB discusses on pages 33 and 34 of its brief, has

19

nothing to do with the partnership with the ­­ with the

20

agency.

21

place to review the Federal law issues is Federal court.

22

The State's only interest in the State court

23

proceeding here is a State interest in State court

24

review, as opposed to Federal court review, of Federal

25

law issues.

The relevant partnership here ­­ the relevant

That's not the same kind of interest that

12
Alderson Reporting Company

2

it had at the regulatory proceeding level.
So our view here is that issue in NOPSI

3

of ­­ you know, is the State interest, for purposes of

4

Younger, the interest at the agency level, or is there a

5

separate interest when it comes to State judicial review

6

of State agency action and Federal judicial review of

7

State agency action, we think that that should be

8

resolved in our favor.

So that's a ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MR. SIMEONE:

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could I take you back to ­­

13

to the agency proceeding?

So I guess I understood, from

14

your respective briefs, that you say the agency

15

proceeding was not an enforcement proceeding, and the

16

agency says it was an enforcement proceeding because you

17

might have brought it initially, but you tried to get

18

out, and then the agency compelled you to keep on going

19

in its process.

Mr. Simeone?
Yes.

So

When we got to the State agency, Windstream

So they ­­ so that

What the IUB did was it reached out to

10

decide a different set of issues, the underlying

11

question of what inter­carrier compensation regime

12

should apply to ­­ to these calls.

13

So at that point, the IUB's theory, now, is

14

when they reached out to decide these Federal issues

15

under the 1996 Act ­­ you know, what's ­­ what's an

16

information service, what's a telecommunication service,

17

what inter­carrier compensation regime applies here ­­

18

when they reached out to decide those Federal issues

19

they say this case became a civil enforcement

20

proceeding.

21

But this takes me back to my description of

22

Dayton.

23

There was an investigation there.

24

of violations of the Ohio civil rights statute.

Dayton was a civil enforcement proceeding.

That is the kind of civil enforcement

3

proceeding to which this Court has applied Younger.

4

That's the kind of proceeding that's like a criminal

case, that takes us back to that traditional principle

6

that courts ­­ Federal courts sitting in equity don't

But in announcing

Official

1

the kind of inter­carrier compensation regime that ought

2

to apply to these calls, the IUB wasn't conducting an

3

enforcement proceeding against Sprint.

4

An interesting point here, I think, is that

5

the IUB's position makes for something very strange

6

under Ex Parte Young ­­ you know, agencies generally

7

have the choice to proceed either by rulemaking, which

8

they often do, or by adjudication.

9

the exact same rules in either way.

And they can make

10

Under the ­­ under the IUB's theory, if the

11

agency proceeds by rulemaking under Ex Parte Young, you

12

can go to Federal court and get an injunction.

13

agency proceeds by adjudication, making the exact same

14

rules, you can't because you ­­ there is a unitary

15

proceeding up through the State court appeals, and you

16

are stuck with that, and certiori review by this Court,

21

the IUB had in this case.

23

IUB could have said, we'll close that docket, and we're

10

I want to go back to a question that came up

11

earlier about Pennzoil and Juidice and how they fit into

12

13

14

similar.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What do you say about the

3

argument that ­­ that once the IUB decided to go on with

4

this proceeding, you didn't want them to, but they did,

5

that that then became a proceeding for them to enforce

6

the access charge?

7

MR. SIMEONE:

Well, I think, again, Your

8

Honor, that that goes back to the differences between

9

this sort of case and the Dayton case.

In this case,

10

what the IUB really was doing was announcing its

11

understanding of ­­ of these provisions of the Federal

12

act.

13

In ­­ in a case like Dayton, where this

14

Court has applied Younger, the ­­ the commission there

15

was ­­ you know, seeking to penalize wrongdoing by

16

the ­­ by the school.

17

there's a ­­ there's an important difference with

18

respect to that traditional principle that Younger

19

reflects of not interfering with State criminal actions.

And it seems to me that

20

There's a big difference between when the

21

State announces rules that will be broadly applicable

22

throughout the industry, like here, and when the State

23

is actually seeking to punish wrongdoing, as in Dayton

24

or as in Middlesex County.

25

If there are no further questions, I will

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. LYNCH

5

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

6
7

MR. LYNCH:

Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

8

Under Sprint's proposed test, after Sprint

9

chose to invoke the jurisdiction of the Iowa Utilities

10

Board, Windstream could have gone to Federal court at

11

any time to enjoin the board proceedings because, under

12

Sprint's test, the board proceedings were remedial and

13

the ­­ Younger abstention was not applicable to those

14

proceedings.

15

That's true despite the fact that, at that

16

time, when the petition was filed, the board was faced

17

with a compelling State interest; that is, an immediate

18

and direct threat to public health and welfare.

19

If Windstream had been able to go to the

20

Federal court and interrupt the State proceedings at

21

that moment, that very act would unavoidably cast

22

dispersions on the State's ability to resolve the

23

Federal issues here in the context of that important

24

State interest, and that is precisely one of the evils

25

that Younger abstention is directed to.

6

MR. LYNCH:

Well, first of all, let me say

7

that the question of whether it's a unitary proceeding

8

or whether there's a ­­ a fork in the road after the

9

agency has completed its proceedings, that question is

10

not part of the question presented here in this case

MR. LYNCH:

Then what's left of

4

the Colorado River case is what it has always been

5

there, which is when the ­­ there is not an important

6

State interest, Younger abstention does not apply.

7

that is always the touchstone of this analysis.

8

You know, the three Middlesex County

9

factors, the first one's easy, is there a pending State

10

proceeding or not?

11

it isn't.

12

And

That's always ­­ either its there or

That's not a problem.

In much that way, when Sprint chose to come

13

to the Iowa Utilities Board, it could have gone to

14

Federal court instead, I assume.

15

board for relief, even though it says that the issues

16

involved are Federal law.

It chose to come to the

The third factor in Middlesex County, the

18

ability of the courts ­­ the State courts, through a

19

state process, to address the Federal questions, also

20

typically not an issue in this type of proceeding.

21

There is the right of appeal to the State courts, and

22

that is going to provide an adequate remedy.

23

Sprint has not challenged that in this case.

were to take that approach, it would result in a denial

16

of abstention in cases like this one that present

17

exactly the evils, the concerns that were presented in

Younger, in terms of disrespect for the State's ability

19

to resolve Federal questions, the concerns of

20

federalism, the concerns of avoiding duplicative ­­

MR. LYNCH:

is that, if the court were to decide to apply the

the results before the Eighth Circuit should still be

coercive.

23

after Sprint filed its petition with the board,

Does Younger say "before"?
No.

You just said before.

Middlesex ­­
No.

So ­­ so in your view,

it doesn't matter which is brought first, I guess.
MR. LYNCH:

No.

Middlesex County requires

that there be a pending State proceeding.
There is one other argument I'd like to
address ­­
JUSTICE ALITO:

Is it correct that, under

20

Eighth Circuit law, the ­­ the party that wants to bring

21

the Federal lawsuit has to go to State court first?

22

MR. LYNCH:

You mean following the agency

23

proceedings, the unitary proceeding ­­ that is the

24

Eighth Circuit's approach, yes, that once you've gotten

25

on the ­­ the State train, you have to ride that through

37

to the end of the State process.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I thought that ­­ I

3

thought that Sprint was ­­ said that they had to go to

4

State court whether they wanted to or not or else they

5

wouldn't be able to go to Federal court.

6

MR. LYNCH:

I believe Sprint's argument ­­ I

7

don't care ­­ don't want to speak for them, but I

8

believe their argument on that point was, following the

9

board's decision, they feel that the Eighth Circuit law

10

required them to file petitions in both Federal court

11

and to invoke the judicial review process in State

12

district court.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

If Younger only applies

14

to ­­ to State proceedings that are brought first, then

15

I guess we could have a ­­ a criminal defendant, who's

16

not yet one, bring an action in Federal court to say

17

that the law is unconstitutional or something or

18

violates a Federal law.

19

him criminally, and the Federal court couldn't ­­ and

20

the Federal court could enjoin the criminal proceeding.

21

MR. LYNCH:

And then the State prosecutes

That would be the ­­ very much

22

like the case in this Court's decision in Steffel

proceeding in a State court, as long as the criminal

2

proceeding wasn't brought first.

3

Court has said?

4

MR. LYNCH:

Is that what this

As I read it, what this Court

5

has said is that there's no Younger abstention when

6

there's no pending State criminal proceeding.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no.

8

one by the time they get around to it.

So ­­ I'm sorry.

misunderstood.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'll ask you to clarify.

13

You've come up with a couple of rules that strike me as

14

counterintuitive, and so I'm trying to figure that one

15

out.

16

The before or after one doesn't seem to work

17

too well in my mind because it would seem ­­ you know,

18

you couldn't ­­ Federal court couldn't.

19

could enjoin a criminal proceeding that came up later in

20

your view, I guess.

21

MR. LYNCH:

Yes.

I think the Federal court,

22

at least, could answer the Federal question presented.

The last thing I wanted to address is there

2

is a lot of discussion, particularly in some of the

3

amicus briefs, to the effect that the board was acting

4

under Federally delegated authority here under some ­­

5

as some kind of deputized Federal agent.

6

the case at all here.

7

State law authority.

8

That is not

The board was acting under its

Sprint relies, for instance, on the AT&T vs.

9

Iowa Utilities Board case for the proposition that the

10

1996 Telecommunications Act asserted Federal authority

11

to regulate local telecommunications matters.

12

That's true, insofar as it goes, but that

13

case is limited to matters addressed by the '96 Act,

14

which was addressed to create in competition within the

15

local exchange marketplace.

16

What we're talking about in this case is

17

access services by which a long distance carrier, such

18

as Sprint, delivers a long distance call to the local

19

exchange carrier, such as Windstream, for completion to

20

Windstream's customers.

21

practically a monopoly service.

22

That service remains

Sprint has no way to get those calls to

23

Windstream's customers, other than by connecting it to

24

Windstream and letting Windstream ­­ compensating

25

Windstream for carrying those calls to the end.

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Because of that, the Federal

2

Telecommunications Act of '96, in Section 251(g),

3

expressly reserved the tariffed access charge regime and

4

did not affect the State's jurisdiction over intrastate

5

access charges.

6

brief at pages 22 and 23, but claims that the situation

7

is unclear as to what applied between 1996 and 2011.

Sprint acknowledges that in its reply

8

But the fact remains that Sprint paid those

9

intrastate access charges without protest from 1996 to

10

2009, when it made the unilateral decision to change the

11

process and start withholding those payments.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, then why wouldn't

13

you say that Sprint was not the initiator of this State

14

process?

15
16
17

Because Sprint withdrew its complaint, right?

MR. LYNCH:

I missed a few words

there.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Sprint ­­ Sprint withdrew

its complaint.
MR. LYNCH:

Sprint was allowed to withdraw

its complaint.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.

So, at that point,

22

it becomes the board's proceeding.

Thank you counsel.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY J. SIMEONE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SIMEONE:

I hope to be very brief.

But

11

there was a lot of discussion about the problem with the

12

IUB's approach lacking sort of meaningful limits.

13

just want to say a couple words about the Middlesex

14

County test because I don't think that that lack of

15

meaningful limits necessarily follows from ­­ from the

16

Middlesex County test, although I do think some

17

clarification of the test would be ­­ would be helpful.

And I

18

Under Middlesex County, of course, Younger

19

requires an ongoing State judicial proceeding, and it

20

requires an important State interest.

21

to ongoing State judicial proceeding, the IUB

22

understands "judicial" to be any adjudicative

23

proceeding.

24

necessarily consistent with the rest of this Court's

25

cases under ­­ applying Younger.

So with respect

But as we argue in our briefs, that's not

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

"Judicial," we think, means an exercise of

2

the State's judicial enforcement authority.

3

that prong of Middlesex County to an exercise of the

4

State's judicial enforcement authority would help to

5

draw this line.

6

So limiting

A second similar point is with respect to

7

the State interest prong of Middlesex County, we argue,

8

of course, that the relevant State interest is the

9

State's interest in the ongoing State proceeding.

Here

10

the ongoing State proceeding was this ­­ was judicial

11

review of the agency proceeding.

12

So by ­­ by limiting the proceeding that

13

you're looking at to the ongoing State judicial

14

proceeding required by the first prong of Middlesex

15

County, then you're really just looking at the State's

16

interest in State judicial review of Federal law

17

questions, as opposed to Federal court judicial review

18

of ­­ of Federal law questions.

19
20
21
22
23
24
25

And, again, that seems to me to help to ­­
to draw a line.
Unless there are further questions, that was
all I had.
