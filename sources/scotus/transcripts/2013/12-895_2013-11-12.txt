CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Rosemond v. United States.

Mr. Elwood.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. ELWOOD:

10

please the Court:

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

It has long been a bedrock principle of

12

American law that aiding and abetting liability requires

13

proof that an accomplice act with purposeful intent to

14

facilitate or encourage the crime of conviction and that

15

mere knowing assistance is insufficient.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you agree that the jury

17

could find the defendant guilty of the firearms charge

18

under a proper instruction?

19

sufficient evidence so that if a proper instruction were

20

given, there could have been a conviction?

21

MR. ELWOOD:

In other words, was there

Even if the ­­ I think in this

22

particular case, even if the jury had been given a

23

proper instruction, it would have been a difficult

24

charge to make out because the government never really

25

argued facilitation after getting knowledge of the

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

firearm.

2

government never asserted evidence of foreknowledge.

3

There was never evidence of foreknowledge; the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I guess we can get

4

into later to whether or not if you know a firearm is

5

being carried and if you then facilitate the commission

6

of the underlying felony by driving the car,

7

participating in the transaction, whether that's

8

sufficient.

9

But let me ask you this:

Would the

10

instruction that was given, which was at JA 196, would

11

it be okay if Paragraph 1, "The defendant knew his

12

cohort used a firearm," I think there is a real problem

13

with that, because it's retrospective.

14

Would the instruction have been sufficient

15

if the defendant knew his cohort would use or was

16

carrying?

17

Would that change it?

MR. ELWOOD:

Well, I think at least that

18

would have required foreknowledge.

19

still have been problematic because it would only have

20

required knowing facilitation.

21

traditionally, have required intentional facilitation,

22

that is, they intend to further the crime.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But I think it would

And courts,

You do not agree, then,

24

that if you know that there's going ­­ that there's a bank

25

robbery afoot and you're cooperating in that, you're ­­

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you're the wheelman, and you also know that the ­­ you

2

know that the people who are conducting the bank robbery

3

are carrying firearms, you say that there's no criminal

4

liability for the firearms unless you intended them to

5

use the firearms; is that your position?

6

MR. ELWOOD:

It's our position that you

7

could infer from the fact that you're assisting the

8

transaction involving ­­

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

MR. ELWOOD:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, no.
Knowledge is not itself intent.
Justice Scalia can protect ­­ his

12

own question.

13

the jury have to find?

14

they can infer, but the question from Justice Scalia is,

15

you're the ­­ you drive ­­ you drive the car, you know

16

firearms are there and might be used, is that

17

sufficient?

18

But the question is:

I know they can ­­ I know what

And that's his question.

MR. ELWOOD:

I ­­ I think that that would

19

be ­­ that would support a verdict.

20

a verdict.

21

What ­­ what does

That would support

The only question ­­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Now, wait.

It would

22

support a verdict ­­ you're saying it would support a

23

finding of ­­ of intent.

24
25

MR. ELWOOD:

That's correct.

But the

question is whether you don't even have to instruct a

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

jury ­­

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Let's assume there's a lot

3

of evidence that he didn't really want them to use

4

firearms, that there's no way you can say he intended

5

them to use, but he knew that they had firearms.

6

MR. ELWOOD:

And I think that you can

7

conclude from that that his purpose in assuming that

8

he's driving ­­

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

It's my hypothetical.

11

that.

12

man hates firearms.

13

is no way he could have intended them to use firearms.

14

But he knew they had firearms.

15

No.

No, no, you can't.

And you cannot conclude from

There is so much other evidence.

This ­­ this

He does not like firearms.

MR. ELWOOD:

There

You know, I hate to be accused

16

of resisting the hypothetical, because in that ­­ in

17

that case, I don't think it matters whether you have the

18

subjective desire, like you think, boy, I sure wish

19

those firearms weren't involved.

20

point, your goal is to facilitate and make sure that

And the

The question is whether

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

So if you intend a

crime ­­ if you intend a crime and you know that the

8

crime is being conducted with firearms, that's enough.

MR. ELWOOD:

I don't think that that ­­ I

10

think that you have to have the fore ­­ the

11

foreknowledge.

12

hypothesize ­­

13

And I think that there are certainly

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Beforehand.

Before ­­ you

14

know beforehand that the crime is going to be

15

perpetrated with firearms.

16

beforehand, and you facilitate the crime.

17

MR. ELWOOD:

That's all you do.

You know

I think that you ­­ the

18

question is whether ­­ you can't even conceive of the

19

circumstance where knowing ­­ that is, participation ­­

20

purpose to facilitate a transaction and to, you know,

help it succeed and it's at a time when he knows that a

gun will be used and that ­­ I think you can conclude

that that is his purpose.

MR. ELWOOD:

have been used if you didn't drive the ­­ or carried if

hypothetical, could a rational jury say he knew about

5

MR. ELWOOD:

I think that in your case with

the foreknowledge and where he, you know, facilitates,

7

he carries the gun and he carries the person to the

8

offense, I think that that would be a tough slog.

9

case ­­ but ours is a case where there isn't

In a

10

foreknowledge and the government never argued that he

11

knew before the gun ­­ before the gun was fired that it

12

was his associate who was the shooter.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, in my case ­­ and I'll

14

finish.

15

in my case, if the judge had given the instruction, it's

16

enough that he knew about it.

He facilitated the crime

17

when he knew there was a gun.

Would that be error?

18

I want to ask another question about this.

MR. ELWOOD:

But

I think it would be error

19

because you're instructing them on the wrong elements.

20

It might be harmless error.

21

agree here that you have to facilitate the crime of

22

conviction and you have to intend that the gun be used.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But the point ­­ both sides

I don't think it's ever

24

harmless error to not instruct the jury ­­ or to

25

instruct the jury not to find one of the elements of the

12
Alderson Reporting Company

1

crime.

2

he has to instruct the jury to find intent.

3

to the court to say, well, there surely was intent

4

anyway so it's harmless error.

5

intent.

6

If, indeed, intent is necessary, it seems to me

It's not up

13

MR. ELWOOD:

But my point

Excuse me.

But what are

­­ even if it winds up not

making a difference.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I think what we're

16

driving at here, and I think this is the moment you're

17

resisting, but to me, and as you can tell from my

18

colleague's questions, if you know that someone's

19

carrying a gun, and whether you want them to use it or

20

not is irrelevant, if they take it out and use it and

21

you have gone along with them in the crime, you're

22

guilty.

23

Okay?

That ­­ that's what we're driving at.

Assume that I believe that.

Assume that I

24

believe that if you have knowledge of the gun, and that

25

I am participating in the crime with your knowledge of

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that gun, whether the knowledge is secured before the

2

crime starts or during the crime, if I continue to

3

participate in the crime knowing that you have a gun,

4

then that's knowledge of the gun and intent to

5

facilitate.

6

I thought the example that you were relying

7

on here or the issue that got confused in the briefs was

8

whether or not, from the sequence of facts in this case,

9

you can actually discern that intent to facilitate the

10

crime because the alleged shooter, which your client

11

said was someone else, jumped into the car and the car

12

took off before anybody could abandon the crime.

13

what I actually thought this case was about:

14

juncture do you instruct the jury to say that you have

15

to be a participant with knowledge of the crime?

16

That's

At what

But you're saying something different right

17

now.

18

pre­knowledge that the gun will be used.

19

You're almost suggesting that there has to be a

MR. ELWOOD:

No, I don't think ­­ I don't

20

think that there has to be pre­knowledge.

21

this:

22

can know of a gun and be participating in the underlying

23

24

use of the gun.

25

My point is

That there are circumstances I think where you

that.

2

Give me an example.
MR. ELWOOD:

I think a jury could conclude ­­ and I'm not

saying that they couldn't conclude otherwise, but they

could conclude that he didn't facilitate the use or

­­ you come up against

6

the government's argument that you don't have to

7

facilitate every element.

8

MR. ELWOOD:

Right.

But that's the thing.

9

Those are what we think would be the proper instruction,

10

that they just have to be instructed on the facilitation

11

and on the intent.

12
13

I'm surprised to hear you

say that you don't need prior knowledge.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I am too.

knowledge before you facilitate it.

That's all I

2

mean by the absence of prior knowledge.

3

everyone here agrees that you need to have knowledgeable

4

before facilitation.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I mean,

Mr. Elwood, you're

6

dealing with all kinds of hypotheticals.

7

case we had a jury determination that Rosemond was the

8

person ­­ he was convicted of carrying ammunition,

9

right?

But in this

There were two counts of carrying ­­ possession

10

of the ammunition.

11

that if he ­­ he possessed the ammunition, he was the gun

12

carrier?

13

MR. ELWOOD:

And couldn't one infer from that

Two things, Justice Ginsburg.

14

First, the government never raised this below and it

15

wasn't pressed or passed on below, and so I think under

16

Glover v. United States this Court wouldn't ordinarily

17

consider that in the first instance, would leave it for

18

remand.

19

But secondly, I think that it's not clear

20

enough.

21

that the error didn't infect that, too, because the jury

22

was instructed four times that you can possess something

23

through constructive possession, through a confederate.

24

And I think when the jury concludes that he is guilty of

25

a possession offense, which is 924(c) as a possession

I mean, you can't say beyond a reasonable doubt

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

offense, as an aider and abetter, and they marked on the

2

judge's instruction that he used the gun, he carried the

3

gun, that the jury could have believed that they were ­­

4

that he constructively possessed the gun and thereby

5

constructively possessed the ammunition.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What was the evidence

7

that the jury had on whether he possessed the

8

ammunition?

9

MR. ELWOOD:

I think the only evidence of

10

possession was that it was inside the gun that was

11

fired.

12

was the shooter because the two eyewitnesss said that

13

the shooter was someone else, that the shooter was the

14

guy in the backseat, who was Ronald Joseph.

15

MR. ELWOOD:

Yes.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think it's necessary

11

for an aider and abetter to facilitate every element of

a criminal offense?

13

MR. ELWOOD:

We're not saying that.

We are

14

saying that when you ­­ you have to instruct them did he

15

facilitate the actual crime of conviction.

16

the government is doing here, what their instruction

17

does is it conclusively presumes that he facilitated the

18

distinct offense, which this Court has said, the

19

entirely new crime of 924(c), from the fact that they

20

did the underlying offense.

Because what

Their favorite example in the brief is a

22

mail fraud example.

23

because you engage in an act of mail fraud, you could be

convicted of racketeering without any additional actus

reus because that is a predicate crime to RICO.

But under the government's theory,

22
Alderson Reporting Company

that's the thing is we're just saying you can't presume

2

the full offense ­­ facilitation of the full offense

3

from the fact that you just facilitated one element.

JUSTICE ALITO:

So if there were not ­­ if

5

the ­­ the drug offense itself were not illegal, there ­­ there

wasn't a drug offense and then the ­­ the additional

firearm element, it wouldn't be necessary for him ­­ for

8

the defendant to facilitate every element of that

offense.

It's dependent on the fact that there's this

10

other criminal conduct.

11

MR. ELWOOD:

We're just saying that they

have to be ­­ the jury just has to be instructed to ask,

question, essentially.

you suggest, but we still say they should be asked

JUSTICE SCALIA:

thought that the law is pretty clear that if you ­­ if

you facilitate an offense, you do not have to facilitate

3

each element of that offense, so long as you have

knowledge that that element existed.

5

MR. ELWOOD:

6

the jury still has to be asked, did he facilitate the

7

crime.

8

­­ that one of the elements is whether they facilitated

9

the crime.

10

This is ­­ both sides agree that you have to ask

deal.

I don't understand what

He has to use the gun himself?

His ­­ our only position

19

is that they have to ask the jury, did he facilitate the

20

924(c) offense.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No.

I think it would help

22

if you told us what the definition of the crime is.

23

We'll talk about the jury instructions later.

24

Justice Scalia is asking whether or not if you

25

facilitate the drug crime knowing that a weapon is being

2

as a legal matter?

3

Forget the jury instructions.

MR. ELWOOD:

And it's our submission that

4

you have to both facilitate the 924(c) offense and that

5

you have to have the intent that the gun be used or

6

carried during and in relation to the crime.

12

think our ­­ the reason why we think it makes a

13

difference is because it's a different crime.

14

presume from the fact that you did the one crime, that

you must also have facilitated the other.

Aiding and abetting requires an intent to

encourage some action by the principal; two, the

knowledge that the principal intends to commit a crime

person commits the crime, which he knows he intends to

Alderson Reporting Company

1

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's a very

3

fanciful hypothetical, because the one thing the guard

4

is going to know, that if the robber gets caught, he's

5

in great jeopardy of ­­ of being caught himself and

6

convicted.

want it to succeed.

itself to that interpretation.

interpretation and it's wrong and we do not contend that

formulation right above that on page 196 that mirrors

reasonable jurors reading that in conjunction with the

6

MR. BASH:

I can

I think the only way Petitioner

7

fits that instruction into his view of the law is

8

because the driver started out driving the people to the

9

bank, so he says, oh, well, you are satisfying my actus

reus requirement because you actually transported the

guns to the bank.

3

Is that the idea?

MR. BASH:

Yeah.

Take this case.

This is

4

an $800 marijuana deal.

5

that happens all the time without firearms.

6

Elwood says, usually this kind of deal is not done with

7

a firearm; only 5 percent of marijuana offenses have a

8

firearm.

9

It's a small­scale drug deal
As Mr.

Yes, if you are on that kind of small­scale

10

deal and all of a sudden it becomes an armed offense,

11

you do have an obligation to withdraw.

12

I think you might have a duress defense if you felt like

13

if I withdraw I'm going to get shot, or something like

14

that.

Now, of course,

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

16

that's the question:

17

opportunity to withdraw after you see that there's a gun

18

in the offense that you didn't expect to be there?

19

do you think that there has to be a reasonable

20

opportunity to withdraw, or would you say, no, everybody

21

has a reasonable opportunity to withdraw all the time;

22

you can just leave?

23

MR. BASH:

Right.

I mean, I guess

Is there always a reasonable

Two points on that.

And

First, I

24

think a lot of that would come in through the duress

25

defense.

I mean, if you really feel like, oh, my God,

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this guy has a gun and he might shoot me if I withdraw,

2

I think you have a pretty solid duress defense.

3

The other point I would say which is maybe a

4

little tangential to the hypothetical, is there's a

5

traditional doctrine of aiding and abetting law.

6

is at 2.06 of the Model Penal Code.

7

Treatise and the Wharton Treatise, that if you

8

countermand your assistance after you have assisted but

9

before the crime is accomplished or completed ­­ for

This

It's in the LaFave

10

example, if your assistance was only encouraging and you

11

start discouraging, or if you take all actions possible

12

to prevent the crime ­­ for example, you assisted, you

13

have a change of heart, you call the police to prevent

14

the crime, you are not liable for aiding and abetting.

15

And I think that reflects a broader point,

16

which is that the traditional common law contours of

17

aiding and abetting work pretty well with the

18

contemporary purposes and problems that this statute was

19

designed to solve.

20

mix of guns and drugs or guns and violence.

21

see why Mr. Elwood contends that if you assist one side

22

of that equation or the other it is a different result.

23

I think if you assist either side of that equation,

24

knowing that the equation is going to happen, by the

25

principle, that is aiding and abetting.

I mean, this is a statute about the

MR. BASH:

Well, of course, the

12

prosecution's principal theory was that he was the

13

gunman; he brought it along to facilitate his drug deal.

14

But assuming the theory of the facts that the gun was

15

fired after Gonzales absconded with the drugs, I mean, I

16

think one way to think about it is like this:

17

that what had happened is that Gonzales had gotten ten

18

paces, and Petitioner or Joseph had tackled him and

19

immediately snatched the drugs back.

20

Court or courts generally would expect the government to

21

charge two counts of possession with intent to

22

distribute for that brief period in which someone

23

snatches possession away and you get it.

obviously not the issue in this case.

So ­­ so, you have a lesser act and a lesser

person ought to be punished in the exact same way as his

that ­­ that ­­ that gels with the historic law of

MR. ELWOOD:

8

One point that I want to emphasize is a

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

point made by Justice Kagan, which is that traditionally

10

because the actus reus is relatively small for aiding

11

and abetting cases, that is exactly why courts have

12

adopted a standard of purposeful intent.

13

said that because the act of an accomplice tends to be

14

less harmful and tends to be more equivocal than that of

15

the principal, that they ordinarily require purposeful

16

intent.

17

And they have

And as Professor Wayne LaFave said, who

18

obviously doesn't have a stake in the case:

19

has seldom been imposed on the basis of knowing

20

assistance.

21

purposeful intent."

22
23

"Liability

The background rule is that it has to be

JUSTICE BREYER:

What cases should I look up

for that?

24

MR. ELWOOD:

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think ­­
That is to say, I thought

generally in the criminal law a person who commits an

illegal act is liable for the known consequences of that

act.

mean, people use all kinds of terminology, different

5

kinds of terminology, but I thought that's the basic

6

principle.

And the cases you can look at are Nye & Nissen ­­
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well just tell me

where in the brief they are, or whatever's easier.
MR. ELWOOD:

I mean, Nye & Nissen, the ­­

19

Nye & Nissen, which is a case of this Court from 1949,

20

where the Court adopted the standard from the Learned

21

Hand case Peoni, that adopted the purposeful intent standard.

22

And Peoni is obviously a very important case as well.

23

But Hicks.

In Hicks, in 1893 this Court

24

reversed a conviction because the jury instruction did

25

not require proof of intent to encourage the crime.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's language.

I am sure

11

you will find language.

12

the holding of the case is that a person who commits an

13

unlawful event ­­ action with knowledge that the other unlawful

14

action will occur is not liable for it.

anything for us on Rule 30?
MR. ELWOOD:

You know, on Rule 30, I won't

pretend that it was a model of clarity in preserving the

10

error about after­arising intent.

11

there is no contest.

12

of how messed up the jury instructions are.

13

preserve, we say, our objection both with respect to the

14

absence of facilitating the right offense, and the

15

intent to commit the crime as opposed to knowledge that

16

the gun would be used.

And so ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How did you preserve

that objection?
MR. ELWOOD:

With respect to intent, by

20

objecting to their instruction on the basis that it

21

didn't include intentional facilitation of the 924(c)

22

offense.

23

And if there are no further questions, we

24

will rely on our submission.
