ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BIBAS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This Court has never applied laches to

12

constrict a federal statute of limitations, and rejected

13

such a claim just four years ago.

14

these copyright infringement claims for four reasons.

15

Laches cannot bar

First, under the separate accrual rule,

these claims are timely.

18

failure to challenge earlier wrongs to foreclose these

19

later claims before they even arose.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Let's ­­ let's take your

4

second point.

5

that you are ­­ are scot­free within the statute of

6

limitations period.

7

you can't be sued beyond that, right?

What a statute of limitations says is not

It simply is a negative.

The wording of the statute

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So it seems to me there is

11

nothing ­­ if ­­ if we adopted the position of the other

12

side, there's nothing that would cause the statute of

13

limitations to be frustrated.

14

MR. BIBAS:

This is not purely about the

15

text, but about the background principle of equity that

16

laches is.

17

there was no ­­ no timeliness rule.

19

displaced it.

Laches domain was as a gap filler where
Congress has

That's why laches developed in equity to
compensate for the absence of limitations periods.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but it continued to be

23

used in equity, even when there were limitations period,

24

didn’t it?

25

certainly not its only use.

It may have started that way, but that was

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. BIBAS:

Not where there was a binding, a

2

Federal one.

3

borrowed loosely from a State in diversity, Federal

4

courts understood themselves to have flexibility to vary

5

from the State limitation period because it wasn't

6

Federal law.

7

9

Where there was an analogous one that was

JUSTICE SCALIA:
Federal law adopted it.

Well, it was Federal law.

MR. BIBAS:

It was Federal law.
This was in the pre­Erie days,

10

where there was understanding that there was a

11

general Federal common law, an equity, that those cases

12

were decided, that ­­ this court in Holmberg v.

13

Armbrecht understood this almost as a Chevron­type

14

argument.

15

Has Congress spoken to the timeliness issue?

16

If yes, Holmberg says the congressional statute is

17

definitive.

18

delegates the matter to, quote, "judicial implication."

19

If not, Holmberg says, then its silence

And then there's some judicial flexibility

20

on timeliness issues.

21

non­timeliness doctrines can cut claims off within the

22

limitations period, but not the timeliness doctrine of

23

laches.

24
25

There's no question that

JUSTICE ALITO:

Should we see anything in

the particular way this provision is worded?

5
Alderson Reporting Company

It says,

1

"No civil action shall be maintained under the

2

provisions of this title unless it is commenced within 3

3

years after the claim accrued."

4

It doesn't say, "Any civil action may be

5

maintained if it is commenced within 3 years after the

6

claim occurred."

MR. BIBAS:

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

9

Yes, Your Honor.

That's why ­­

So it doesn't ­­ you know,

it says ­­ it says you can't do it, unless it's within

10

three years, but it doesn't say that, if it's within

11

three years, you’re home­free.

MR. BIBAS:

Yes, Your Honor.

That's why I

said it's not strictly a textual argument.

timeliness doctrines are not to cut them short because

those doctrines, such as laches, are where there isn't a

Why, by the way ­­ I mean,

8

I guess the ones that increase the statute of

9

limitations, do they apply, too?

10
11

It doesn't say

anything about them.
MR. BIBAS:

The timeliness doctrines of

12

tolling and the discovery rule are distinguishable.

13

This Court understands that when Congress ­­ tolling and

14

discovery rules developed in order to interpret

15

limitations periods.

16

17

interpret.

18

You cannot have a tolling or

19

It's intertwined with interpreting the word "accrues,"

20

for a discovery rule, or interpreting "3 years."

24

your words, and I fill in, instead of "tolling,"

25

MR. BIBAS:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Tolling has always been used ­­
Yes, yes, yes.

All right.

3

But I mean, now, what you're talking about is custom.

4

You're not talking about language.

MR. BIBAS:

Because the language sounds

10

11

doctrines.

12

14

And why would we apply those and not apply
the shortening ones, too.
MR. BIBAS:

Well, first, briefly,

15

Respondents concede there are no words in this Act that

16

even give a toehold for laches.

17

of the law in 1957 and to this day is that tolling and

18

discovery rules were long background periods for

19

interpreting limitations rules.

troubles me about this case is this:

But they originated in
The tolling rules

What

Did the adoption

from bringing over anything else from equity into law?
Tolling used to exist.

It was brought over

3

into law before the new Rules of Civil Procedure.

4

therefore, you would not be altering any substantive

5

right to continue to apply that tolling rule.

6

And

Your argument here is ­­ is that to apply

7

laches is to alter a substantive right, and therefore,

8

under the ­­ under the Rules Enabling Act is not

9

allowable.

10

My question is this:

Do you think that the

11

Rules Enabling Act prevented courts from doing what they

12

had in the past?

13

means of saying everything that was in equity is now in

14

law, but rather sitting back and thinking ­­ you know,

15

here's another part of equity that should be brought

16

over into law, not because the Act says so, but because

17

we think it ought to be, just as we thought, 50 years

18

ago, the tolling ­­ the ­­ the tolling provision should

19

be brought over into law.

That is, not using the Act as the

that by reason of the Act?
MR. BIBAS:

Yes, not only the words of

23

Section 2072(b) that you may not "enlarge, abridge, or

24

modify any substantive right," but this Court's holding

25

in Grupo Mexicano recognized that the historical limits

1

on equitable remedies are limited to where they were at

2

the times ­­

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But it says, "The rules

4

shall not alter or amend any substantive right."

5

what I'm saying is it isn't the rules that do it.

6

just we have made the independent justification that

7

this ancient rule, which was applied in equity, ought to

8

be applied in law as well.

9

MR. BIBAS:

all areas, is deprived of that right?

19

particular Act, even if we had the option, we shouldn't

20

exercise it?

21

MR. BIBAS:

Can you

Yes, Your Honor.

I think it's

22

very salient that this is the Copyright Act, an Act with

23

detailed statutory safeguards against financial and

24

evidentiary prejudice.

25

is a property right registered with the government with

Moreover, copy ­­ the copyright

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a clear registry that wants clear, simple, predictable,

2

easy­to­apply rules, as the policy of the '76

3

Copyright Act.

4

And this Court's case law, in the trademark

5

context from the late 19th century, says, when we're

6

dealing with a property right that extends into the

7

future, injunctive relief has to remain available to

8

vindicate that property right, unless there is something

9

that rises to the level of a distinct defense, an

10

abandonment or an estoppel.

11

But the ­­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You see, counselor, this

13

is my problem.

14

fundamentally because I don't know that you're entitled

15

to injunctive relief, but you might be entitled to a

16

compulsory license.

17

And ­­ and I sort of disagree with you

And by that, I mean you have ­­ this is the

18

government's position, and maybe I'm arguing for it, the

19

government says you might be entitled to payment for the

20

use of your copyright because it belongs to you and

21

there shouldn't be some adverse possession right that

22

the other side gets.

23

But in terms of injunctive relief, given

24

their reliance on your failure to act for 18 years, they

25

shouldn't be put out of business and told that they

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

can't continue in their business.
And so that's the kind of policy I'm talking

3

about, which is break down the remedies and tell me ­­

4

I'm more moved by the fact that someone could take over

5

your copyright than I am by your injunctive relief

6

argument.

7

MR. BIBAS:

Yes, Your Honor.

You're correct

8

that the Copyright Act has provisions that forbid

9

adverse possession, that require transfers to be in

10

writing, and so the right itself can't be defeated.

11

I agree with your premise.

12

So

Now, as to how that bears on injunctive

13

relief, we do not take the position that an injunction

14

must automatically issue.

15

clearly it mustn't, but one must look at the traditional

16

test for equitable relief.

17

This Court in eBay said very

And one of the factors in that test is

18

prejudice to the defendant, but it must be balanced

against prejudice to the plaintiff and the public

interest.

And that is foreclosed if one uses laches as

Why?

You'd be entitled

24

to money for their infringement.

25

3 years ­­ you only go

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

future, presumably, you can get an order giving you

2

damages for that.

3

MR. BIBAS:

We certainly agree that we're

4

entitled to damages, going forward, but we don't agree

5

that that's exclusive because I ­­ I'd point to the

6

Chief Justice's concurrence in the eBay case.

7

copyright is a property right.

A

It comes with the right to exclude
presumptively.

That right cannot necessarily be fully

10

enforced in all circumstances, but presumptively, it

11

ought to remain on the table to enforce with injunctive

12

relief.

13

Now, you are correct, Respondents have

14

entered into commercial agreements ­­ arrangements for

15

the next two years.

16

sitting in equity to say, let's balance the hardships.

17

The hardships between now and 2015 might look different

18

from the hardships in 2015 until the middle of the 21st

19

Century.

20

It would be reasonable for a court

We might tailor the duration and the scope

21

of injunctive relief to save some damages, some

22

royalties for a few years, but that's not a reason to

23

defeat her right to exclude for the next four decades.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Bibas, I would have

thought that there was something in the copyright

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

context that cuts against you, and that's that, because

2

of this separate accrual rule and the feature of these

3

rolling statutes of limitations combined with very, very

4

lengthy copyrights terms, that essentially a plaintiff

5

cannot bring suit for years ­­ decades ­­ and time the

6

suit in order to maximize her own gain.

7

That strikes me as something that we don't

8

usually see in statute of limitations cases.

9

we don't have very many cases where courts have applied

I mean,

10

laches as against the statute of limitations, but that's

11

because you can't think of many instances in which it

12

would be considered unfair to take the entire statute of

13

limitations to bring a suit.

14

But in this context, you look at something

15

that seems very different.

16

years, given the way the separate accrual work ­­ rule

17

works.

18

MR. BIBAS:

A plaintiff can wait 20

Your Honor, I think your

19

considerations cut in favor of our position.

20

our client brings suit now or 20 years from now, she

21

gets three and only three years' damages.

22

in this case is that creative works are worth the most

23

right after they're released, and so the value of the

24

claim goes down.

13

that.

14

It would radically upend the law to say

And to come back to your point that we don't

15

see laches in these cases, that, again, cuts our

16

direction.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yeah, but the ­­ the

18

mortgagor does ­­ does not invest substantial amounts of

19

money the way MGM did here, on the assumption that,

20

since suit hasn't been brought for 20 years, there's ­­

21

there's no valid claim.

22

in that situation.

23

I mean, that's the difference

You're talking about inducing ­­ or causing

3

and then, when that money starts to pay off, you file

4

suit and ­­ and you get three years' worth of ­­ of

5

their profits.

6

MR. BIBAS:

Under the Copyright Act, they

7

are entitled to deduct all the expenses that are

8

attributable to earning the profits from infringement,

9

so Plaintiffs don't get a dime until Respondents recoup

10

those expenses.

11

Moreover, one who has notice of a registered

12

copyright in the face of protest has no legitimate

13

good­faith expectation and continue to infringe.

14

file a declaratory judgment act, engage in settlement

15

negotiations, or infringe at your peril.

it.

14

today about the text and how it doesn't bar it.

15

We've already had the discussion here at Court

But second, for the reasons that

16

Justice Kagan gave, the copyright situation is unique in

17

that there is this separate accrual rule, which allows a

Yes.
­­ once you have given them

the right to apply laches to an injunction, you have

10

given them precisely nothing because exactly the same

11

thing will happen to them once you bring 15 legal

13

My

specific question is, in the copyright area, as here ­­

I understand the words.

You're giving me legal arguments.

I'll look into that.

But I'm saying, in practice, no one in his

when every penny is going to have to go to the copyright

16

owner ­­ not every penny that they spent, but every

17

penny of profit.

18

Because, every three years, they face a lawsuit.

19

And ­­ and who's going to do it?

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, that's what I'm trying

20

to say is that I don't think that that would be the case

21

if infringement were shown.

22

recognized in the New York versus Cassini case, that in

23

fashioning injunctive relief, it's not just that you

24

give an injunction or you don't give an injunction, it

25

could be the case that, in a situation like this one,

This Court, for example,

for example, the Court could say, I will allow the

work, but I will pay a reasonable royalty, or I will put

So there is some splitting of the difference

that laches can ­­ is a cousin of equitable estoppel and

24

that it's right that equitable estoppel could bar the

claim entirely.

The reason that we are distinguishing

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

between law and equity are two reasons.

2

there is a very long history that laches is unique to

3

the courts of equity, and this Court has recognized it.

First of all,

4

It recognized it in Mack, it recognized in

5

the Oneida case, it recognized it in Merck, it was in

6

the Pomeroy treatise, that this was a classic division

7

that was only in equity, and this Court has continued to

8

recognize it.

9

But the second reason is that it makes sense

10

to look to laches principles in fashioning equitable

11

relief in this context as opposed to the legal relief,

12

because under the Copyright Act, when a person shows, a

13

plaintiff shows infringement, that person is entitled to

14

actual or statutory damages in a certain amount.

15

that is a mechanical calculation that we expect juries

16

to make.

17

But it's not the ­­

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ms. Saharsky, this ­­

20

address for us, and that is your position is damages

21

You're right that there is

5

This Court went on in Holmberg and said, first, a suit

6

in equity may fail though not barred by the act of

7

limitations.

8

and, of course, we win this case under that principle.

9

That's a pretty clear equitable principle,

And what the Court said is if want of due

diligence by the plaintiff may make it unfair to pursue

the defendant, laches, then also fraudulent conduct on

the part of the defendant may make it unfair for the

19

plaintiff to proceed ­­ fraudulent concealment.

20

And then the Court said ­­ and this is the

21

critical point ­­ it cited Bailey v. Glover, which also

22

had the goose­and­gander rule embedded in it.

23

this equitable doctrine is read into every Federal statute

25

nature of tolling, plus laches, that every time the

by saying, Tolling is available, discovery is available,

waiver, abandonment, acquiescence, estoppel, and all of

7

the other equitable doctrines, eight of which are listed

in rule 8 that this Court has determined are available

9

in all civil actions.

10

But he says, laches ­­ which this Court also

11

listed in rule 8, is not available in this civil action.

MR. PERRY:

But do you agree with it?
This Court, Justice Kagan, in

14

the Foster v. Mansfield case in 1892 said ­­ and I

15

quote ­­ after ten years, quote, "There is certainly a

16

presumption of laches, which it is incumbent on the

17

plaintiff to rebut," which is the same concept that the

18

Ninth Circuit articulated, although we submit, did not

19

apply.

20

And the Federal Circuit, in the Akerman

21

case, very carefully explained what this means.

22

Federal Rule of Evidence 301 type presumption, sometimes

23

called a bursting bubble presumption, which says that

24

when the defendant raises this defense, it requires the

25

plaintiff to come forward with the burden of production

38
Alderson Reporting Company

It's a

Official

1

of an excuse or a rationale for the delay, but the

2

burden of persuasion always rests on the defendant

3

because it is an affirmative defense.

4

And the Akerman decision is very clear on

5

this, and to the extent the Ninth Circuit spoke of

6

presumptions, that's exactly what it meant because in no

7

place was an evidentiary presumption applied against

8

her, and, in fact, of course, this was a summary

9

judgment case, so the evidence was undisputed.

10

The

record was irrefutable as to the prejudice.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I guess, partly, that

12

suggests a burden of persuasion, but partly, it suggests

13

just a kind of starting position is that, if there was

14

conduct outside the limitations period, it was

15

prejudicial, and I guess I want to know why that would

16

be.

17

MR. PERRY:

Your Honor, I think it's ­­

18

there's a common sense concept that, if you are within

20

three­year period, after the claim first accrued in

21

presumption that laches doesn't apply.

2

of limitations purposes, it’s another one of the

3

disconnects between these two doctrines. The farther one

4

gets away, it is a reality of the world, as the

5

Government notes in its brief, that the evidentiary

6

prejudice is likely to increase because documents get

7

destroyed, witnesses lose their memory, and so forth.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, one can agree with

that and not think that if conduct happened three years

10

and two days earlier, there is ­­ that the burden of

11

coming forward and the necessity to give a reason flips

12

to the other side.

13

MR. PERRY:

I agree with that, Your Honor.

14

And to be clear, the district court didn't apply any

15

such presumption and didn't put any such burden on

16

Ms. Petrella, so the language in the Ninth Circuit

opinion is irrelevant to when a case was tried in the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHANOS BIBAS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

20

MR. BIBAS:

21

Five points.

Thank you, Your Honor.
First, Justice Sotomayor was

22

entirely right that Holmberg, Russell, Mack, and Merck,

23

just four years ago, make this settled law.

reason Justice Kagan says that we can't see laches in

statutes of limitations ­­ this Court in Klehr carefully

8

distinguished separately accruing discrete wrongs within

9

a limitations period from continuing violations that

10

reach back beyond the limitations period to claim

11

damages beyond that.

12

When my friend says we could have brought

13

this exact same suit in 1991, he is absolutely

14

incorrect.

15

entire statutory penalty for my client would have been

16

no recovery from 1991 until 2005.

The only case that looks remotely close that

3

my friend cites in his brief is the Morgan case.

4

Morgan is completely distinguishable for two reasons.

5

The first is Morgan involved bootstrapping damages from

beyond the limitations period, claiming damages from

One of the pillars of

Since we don't have a limit on damages, we

19

It was not briefed and argued, but there was a mention

20

of it, so Morgan was not within the statute of

21

limitations.

22

That was not the holding.

There was no statute of limitations.

And when this Court interpreted it in
