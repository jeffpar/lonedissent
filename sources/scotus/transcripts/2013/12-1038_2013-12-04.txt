P R O C E E D I N G S
(10:03 a.m.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

this morning in Case 12­1038, United States v. Apel.
Mr. Horwich.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HORWICH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Section 1382 makes it a misdemeanor for a

11

person to reenter a military base after having been

12

ordered not to do so by the commanding officer.

13

the Ninth Circuit here added another requirement for

14

conviction, which is that the defendant must be found in

15

a place that, as a matter of real property law, is

16

within the exclusive possession of the United States.

Now,

17

That requirement isn't anywhere in the text

18

of the statute, no court has ever given an explanation

19

of where it comes from, and Respondent no longer defends

20

that requirement.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it is ­­ it is in the

22

Air Force manual and in a JAG opinion, was the exclusive

23

possession criterion.

24
25

MR. HORWICH:

Well, I think I would say a

couple things about those sources, Justice Ginsburg.

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

First of all, the ­­ they reflect, essentially,

2

conservative legal advice that recognizes that some

3

courts had made a reference to such a requirement.

4

the responsible thing to do if you're in a JAG rendering

5

an opinion on what the right way to structure a lease is

6

or whether a particular place is, in fact, covered by

7

1382 is to confirm that, yes, this would meet the

8

criteria the courts have established.

So

9

But that doesn't ­­ certainly doesn't make

10

it binding on this Court and other courts have held to

11

the contrary.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Has ­­ since this case

13

has been pending quite a while, has the manual changed,

14

has ­­ to ­­ to delete the exclusive possession?

15

MR. HORWICH:

If Your Honor is referring to

16

the ­­ the U.S. Attorneys' manual, no.

17

altered.

18

section of the U.S. Attorneys' manual makes clear that

19

it ­­ it doesn't ­­ it's not intended to create rights,

20

it's not intended to bind the Department of Justice or

21

otherwise modify the meanings of criminal statutes.

22

It's simply a reference guide.

23

It hasn't been

Although I ­­ I would say that the very first

And it is a reference guide that certainly

24

would be accurate in some circuits, we think incorrect,

25

and that's what, of course, this Court is now in a

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

position to resolve the disagreement between the courts

2

on that ­­ on that subject.

3

So what Respondent does argue ­­ because, of

4

course, Respondent isn't even defending that requirement

5

here, is that ­­ and what the case then comes down to, I

6

guess, is that Vandenberg Air Force Base is not a

7

military installation.

8

think all of it is.

9

Now, we think it is.

And we

And the reason for that is that the statute

10

refers comprehensively to a long list of places,

11

reservation, fort, post, arsenal, yard, station,

12

installation, that covers the range of places that are

13

subject to military command.

14

course, a place that's subject to military command.

15

in particular ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And Vandenberg is, of

officer's jurisdiction.

23

are set up is that the civilian leadership in the

24

Department of Defense defines bases, and then the

25

military commanders who are appointed by the president,

What might be thought of, in a

Alderson Reporting Company

then, through appointing subordinate commands, will have

2

units assigned to particular bases, and the commanding

3

officer of the unit will be the commanding officer of

4

the base to which the unit is assigned.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, some military

6

installations are located in very rural areas.

7

suppose you have an installation in such a place and

8

there are buildings and ­­ and facilities that you can

9

see in one part of this territory, but there's a lot of

Now,

10

open ­­ there are a lot of open fields around it.

11

Would ­­ and suppose there's ­­ it's not posted.

12

that still be a military installation if somebody goes

13

on that?

14
15
16

MR. HORWICH:

Would

It ­­ it would, although let

me say a few things about that.
Your description, actually, is pretty apt as

17

to Vandenberg itself.

18

large areas of what you, I think, accurately described

19

as open fields, that are there precisely to serve as

20

a ­­ kind of a buffer zone around these enormous rocket

21

launches.

22

other parts aren't.

23

It's in a rural area.

There are

And some parts of it are particularly posted;

We do think that there would ­­ that a

24

defendant needs to be put on notice in some ­­ in some

25

respect.

We refer to it, I think, inartfully in our

6
Alderson Reporting Company

brief as actually that the defendant would have

2

knowledge.

3

on notice.

4

I think it's more the defendant needs to be

5

geographic place, the place to look, for starters, is a

6

8

marked off as Vandenberg Air Force Base.

9

If you look at a­­ if you go ­­ nowadays, you go on the

But a map, presumably,

10

reflects who owns the property, and you, yourself, say

11

that that's not what's significant.

12

point in your brief to suggest some kind of more

13

functional test, is this property being used for

14

military purposes?

15

to you?

16

And I took your

Am I ­­ am I wrong in ascribing that

MR. HORWICH:

Yes, yes.

We don't ­­ we're

17

not suggesting a functional test.

18

is that the coverage of 1382 should be coextensive with

19

the commander's authority, which is, essentially, as I

20

sort of suggested, in the nature of a jurisdictional

21

test.

22

authority extend to as a matter of military law?

What we're suggesting

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But I'm not sure that I

2

the list of items mentioned in the statute ­­

8

command, doesn't.

9

When I look at

Each of those terms has an operational

It makes no sense, in answer to Justice

10

Alito's question, to say you need notice, unless that

11

facility has a military flavor to it that someone could

12

know about.

13

but you've got a whole green line around it to tell

14

people which sections you are actually considering the

15

camp, and he was found outside of that green area.

16

And you talk about this particular camp,

You've got a public school, a public

17

highway.

18

off of lands that the military is not using in its

19

operations.

20

I'm not quite sure how you can keep a person

MR. HORWICH:

Well, I guess, just to take

21

the last point there, I would disagree with the premise

22

that the military is not using these lands in their

23

operation.

24

there will be ­­ there's a launch tomorrow at

25

Vandenberg, and the other highway that's kind of

indistinguishable from Highway 1, for these purposes, is

2

going to be closed down because it's in the area that's

3

dangerous because it's in the potential impact zone ­­

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, you close down ­­

5

you close down roads for parades.

6

for other public needs.

7

MR. HORWICH:

You close down areas

Certainly.

But I would be

8

clear that the reason that is being closed down is

9

because the commanding officer at Vandenberg has

10

determined that that property, which is owned by the

11

United States, is placed under his ­­ placed under his

12

authority as a commanding officer, is ­­ is ­­ is

13

assigned to the Department of the Air Force for

14

administration, he has determined that his military

15

needs require closing that ­­ that part on that day.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that's confirmed in

17

the terms of the easement, if you look at the easement

18

between the U.S. and the County of Santa Barbara.

19

MR. HORWICH:

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Precisely so, Justice Kennedy.
The ­­ it makes it very

21

clear that the military commander has authority to

22

exercise control over the easement property.

23

MR. HORWICH:

The ­­ precisely so, Justice

24

Kennedy.

25

point here, which is that it would be a very odd result

And I think that gets to the bigger picture

9
Alderson Reporting Company

1

to say that a ­­ that a military commander has to

2

maximally inconvenience the public by shutting a place

3

down at all times in order to preserve the misdemeanor

4

sanction that backs up his authority.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If ­­ if your position is

6

right, then I ­­ I think there would be nothing left of

7

Flowers, because Flowers, the government owned that area

8

as well.

9

this case, the ­­ the property is used as a public

10
11
12
13

Is there anything left ­­ I mean, that ­­ in

highway, and people go back and forth.
In Flowers, it was a street.

So are you

urging that Flowers is essentially overruled?
MR. HORWICH:

No, not at all,

14

Justice Ginsburg.

15

supportive of our position here, on the statutory point,

16

precisely because the Court thought to resolve Flower on

17

the constitutional grounds.

In fact, I think Flowers is

18

And there was no question there that it was

19

covered by 1382, notwithstanding the fact that it is ­­

20

that it could be described as a public street, it was

21

also property that was under the command of the

22

commanding officer at Fort Sam Houston in that ­­ in

23

24

question.

25

And so the Court went to the constitutional

1

interested, about the ­­ the constitutional differences

2

between this case and Flower.

3

strongly imply that coverage of 1382, which the Court

4

would ordinarily address first before reaching the

5

constitutional question, wasn't in doubt there, nor was

6

it in doubt in any of the cases that this Court has

7

decided under 1382, each of which has involved a

8

military installation that is, to some greater or lesser

9

extent, in some places or other, open to the public.

10

So ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

But Flower does ­­ does

doing that?
MR. HORWICH:

So his ­­ the terms of his

20

barment order and the ordinary terms on which barment

21

orders are issued at Vandenberg is that there's an

22

exception carved out for him to traverse along the

easement, which, again, is in the nature of a concession

24

to public convenience, which it seems quite unfair to

25

through Vandenberg's property.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So what happens, for

10

MR. HORWICH:

In the ­­ in the school

12

certain about this, but I believe that the ­­ well,

13

14

the middle school is within the area that is ­­ within

15

the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the United

16

States.

17

It's been ceded to the United States.

So the ­­ the proper response there would

MR. HORWICH:

No.

If ­­ if we're talking

2

about an area that's under the exclusive Federal

3

jurisdiction, the military ­­ the military police or ­­

4

or security forces, as they're now ­­ as they're now

5

called, are not empowered to make arrests in that formal

6

sense.

7

enforcement officers who are empowered to make arrests

8

can then respond.

9

They can ­­ they can detain so that law

So, for example, if you have the more common

10

things, a traffic stop, maybe, on one of the roads off

11

the highway or something like that, they will need to

12

detain and wait for an appropriate ­­ an appropriate law

13

enforcement official to respond.

14

So, again, there is somewhat of a ­­ of a

15

different situation obtains on the highway, because

there ­­ there is authority for the ­­ the county

police, for the county sheriff, for example, to respond.

because, there, the station and the tracks that actually

take a train, if they've been barred, well, yes, they're

4

allowed to travel on the highway that goes there, and

5

they're allowed to wait at the train station and go.

6

And that arrangement, obviously, has been

7

determined by the appropriate officials to be sufficient

8

to protect the ­­ the military's interests.

9

it weren't, I imagine we would see a different

11

I think the larger point here, though, is

12

that, if the commanding officer has the authority to

14

these barments, it seems ­­ across the whole area, which

Precisely so.

reading, because, of course, Respondent's reading turns

on the coverage of what "military installation" means,

18

well, which deals with the ­­ with enforcing

19

regulations, the oddity of his reading is that, if a

20

truck then did drive on the highway bringing the

21

flammable materials, the truck would be in violation of

22

the regulation.

23

5

MR. HORWICH:

No, I understand it to be

6

based on neither of those things.

7

based on a real property analysis, which says, at this

8

point, where Respondent was found, there is an easement,

9

so there is a real property interest that is held by

10

someone other than the United States; therefore, the

11

United States does not exclusively possess it.

16

absurdities ­­ the kind of absurdities that the Ninth

17

Circuit's position seems like it might lead to is that

18

it doesn't seem like it's limited to easements.

19

Respondent, of course, as we know, wasn't using the

20

easement for its purpose, so it's just sort of

21

coincidence he's also on the easement.

But if I might just say one word about the

would defeat on the Ninth Circuit's approach the

JUSTICE ALITO:

the United States and used for a military reservation.

Would there be exclusively Federal criminal

jurisdiction there, or would there not be concurrent

MR. HORWICH:

Well, the way ­­ that's ­­ that's

So the

16

State has ceded to the United States that jurisdiction

17

over ­­ over the base.

18

it's correct, the United States retroceded that

19

jurisdiction back to the State as to the highways, so

But that's really a separate issue from

23

what's presented here because that would control the

24

application of the Assimilative Crimes Act, for example,

25

but this statute ­­ this statute is not ­­ this statute

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is a freestanding Federal statute.

2

And I would say, in the example that you

3

give, I think this ­­ it's worth talking for a moment

4

about the situation, where the United States leases

5

property and places it under military jurisdiction and

6

gives it to a military command.

7

There certainly are such places, and that's

8

why an ownership test isn't quite right.

9

ownership test, Justice Kagan, is sort of right about 95

I think an

10

percent of the time because it's usually true that the

11

United States is going to want to own the places that it

12

puts under military command, but it's not perfect in the

13

leasing context.

14

It's also ­­ it's also problematic in the

15

situation that comes up in some of the courts of appeals

16

cases regarding Coast Guard or naval security zones,

17

which are designated waters adjacent to a base that are

18

appurtenant to the commander's authority over the base,

19

and those aren't kind of owned in ­­ in exactly the same

20

way.

21

But they're, nonetheless, under military

22

command, and the courts of appeals had no difficulty

23

seeing that they're covered.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I ­­ I had thought that,

in your brief, you thought that the ownership test was

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

both underinclusive and overinclusive.

2

MR. HORWICH:

Yes, I think that's correct,

3

too, because there are certainly property that the

4

United States owns ­­ plenty of property ­­ most

5

property that the United States owns isn't under

6

military command.

7

And so it's not just Federal ownership,

8

it's ­­ although I would ­­ I would point out that, with

9

respect to these other statutes that deal with other

10

agencies of the government that ­­ that administer

11

lands, it is generally true ­­ I can't say that it's

12

exclusively ­­ it's true across the board ­­ but it's

13

generally true that there's a statute, something like

14

this one, that corresponds to the regulatory authority

15

of a land management agency.

16

So ­­ and, again, we wouldn't punch holes in

17

the misdemeanor sanctions that back up those other land

18

management agencies' authority, so I don't see why we

19

would punch holes in this statute, either.

MR. HORWICH:

The ­­ speaking outside the

record, it seems like it was probably drawn to guide

3

road crews in the parts of the road they should be

resurfacing because one of the terms of the easements is

5

that California is responsible for maintaining the road.

6

And so ­­ you know, when the California

7

repave it or something, they need to know how ­­ how

on other places of the base in various shades of being

worn down.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Good morning, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
This is a case about the right to peacefully

7

protest on a fully open public road, in a designated

8

protest zone.

9

and, for that matter, the United States itself,

For decades, every lower Federal court,

10

interpreted 18 United States Code Section 1382 to apply

11

only if there's exclusive Federal possession.

12

interpretation would raise grave First Amendment issues.

13

Any other

As Justice Ginsburg pointed out, this case

14

is indistinguishable from this Court's prior holding in

15

Flower v. United States.

Flower involved a street that

16

was on a military base.

you're arguing here.
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Your Honor, there are two

arguments here.

because military installation requires exclusive

possession.

6

One is that 1832 ­­ 1382 does not apply

The second argument ­­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

13

But there's no dispute in Flower that 1382 would apply

14

because it was a street within the military base.

15

But to go to Justice Kennedy's question,

16

this Court in Albertini was very clear that what Flower

17

means is that, when there is a fully open public route,

18

there is a right to use it for speech activities.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, that ­­ that's a

20

First Amendment case.

21

on the argument you make under this statute.

22

to me that the statute should be construed according to

23

normal rules of easements, and the owner of the

24

overburden that easement.

line, that ­­ you know, he just can't be here, and he's

17

excluded, then why don't they have sufficient authority

18

to prevent him from reentering?

19

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

In both of the instances

20

that led to barment orders, he crossed that green line

21

that was on the military base side, and if he does that,

22

then 1382 applies.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

I see.

So ­­

But the ­­ but the

barment order that Mr. Horwich just read to us says that

36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

he can use the road, but that's not ­­ because the road

2

is outside the statute, that's because the government,

3

as a matter of grace, said right in the order, right in

4

the bar order, you can use the road.

5

So there's a sharp difference.

The

6

government says the road is under military control, if

7

the commander so chooses, but we're going to let him use

8

the road.

9

including the road, as including this protest area.

10

The government treats the ­­ the domain as

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Your Honor, there is a

11

difference between the road and the area within the

12

green line.

13

is the reason why the barment orders were permissible is

14

he crossed the green line.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And so what I was saying to Justice Kagan

But you're saying that if he

16

had not crossed the green line, he could not have been

17

excluded?

18

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's correct.
And you're saying that the

20

military cannot exclude any person from any of this area

21

outside the green line?

22

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

That's correct.

1382 only

23

applies to that which is in the exclusive possession of

24

the United States, which is the area in the green line.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So we're back to the real

estate test.

on the ­­ on the exclusive ownership test.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you're defending the

Ninth Circuit's?
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

We're very much

defending ­­
JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, that's what I don't

15

understand.

16

the reason I'm asking this question is the record is not

17

developed.

18

Let me press ­­ at the risk of repetition,

I looked at the Google maps.

It looked to me like this area is sort of a

19

suburban house with a lawn in front of it, and you drive

20

along the street, and you suspect that the street may

21

belong to the city a little way up the lawn; but beyond

22

that, it probably belongs to the homeowner.

23

And when you try to see where does the green

24

line cross that grassy area, you can't easily tell,

25

and ­­ and it may be just a foot or two.

38
Alderson Reporting Company

So it may have

Official

1

been inconceivable that your client didn't cross the

2

green line or maybe he didn't.

3

I don't know.

So, therefore, you're back to a more basic

4

test, and you say, we agree with the Ninth Circuit that,

5

if they do not have exclusive control, the military

6

can't enforce this statute.

7

But what do we do, which was my question,

8

about instances where the military does not have

9

exclusive control, but the reason it doesn't has nothing

10

to do with roads, nothing to do with green lines, it has

11

to do with thousands of other easements that have

12

nothing to do with this case; therefore, I'm pressing

13

you to get a definition of this statute that will serve

14

your ends without getting into all these other kinds of

15

easements.

16

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

And I think the functional

17

approach that Justice Sotomayor suggested is exactly

18

that.

19
20
21

JUSTICE BREYER:

And what is that, in your

understanding?
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

I think, here, it is the

22

area that the United States government has determined by

23

where it's built a fence and drawn the green line, that

24

it has exclusive possession.

Greer, this case emphasized that Fort Dix, even though

15

it was open, still was in the exclusive possession.

saying the government, what, does or does not have

test.

3

That is not a possession

It's a purely functional test.
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

But, Your Honor, Congress

4

didn't, in 1382, say, "all land owned by the military."

5

It used the phrase "military installation," and whenever

6

that phrase has been defined, it always refers to the

7

area that is reserved to be used for military purposes.

8
9

The United States can draw the green line
and build the fence wherever it chooses.

Here, it

10

decided to do so in a particular place, leaving open a

11

fully open public road with a designated protest zone.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

I have the

13

same problem that Justice Breyer has.

14

the military, generally, the land, but they are run by

15

outside contractors, sometimes.

16

they've given up exclusive control of the PX, that they

fail your test?

So does the utility company.

I don't know

19

if it's possible that military bases generate their own

20

utilities, but I presume that, somewhere, they don't,

21

and they have an easement to drive up and read their

22

meters.

23

There may be easements for repairs of

24

certain underground things that ­­ that supply the base.

25

That's not exclusive control, so I'm ­­ or possession.

44
Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

So what ­­ what does your test mean?
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

It is where the United

3

States chooses to exercise exclusive possession.

4

United States, for example, in Greer, said, we are

5

claiming we have exclusive possession over the entire

6

area of Fort Dix, even though there was a public road.

7

If the government wants to say, even as to the PX within

8

Vandenberg, that's within our exclusive possession, they

9

can do so.

The

10

But the government, by granting the easement, by

11

allowing the public road, by creating the designated

12

protest zone, has done something very different than

13

exclusive possession.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So that ­­ that road for

15

the public utility for which there is an easement of

16

travel is not exclusive to the U.S.?

17

travel into the base at any time they want to?

18

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

So anybody can

No, Your Honor, because,

19

in order to come on to that utility easement, you would

20

need the express permission of the base commander.

21

that utility easement would still be an exclusive

22

control, to go to Justice Breyer's question ­­

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So

You need the express

24

permission of the base commander to drive down the road.

It's just that he has given it to ­­ to the public at

Because it's been

ceded by the United States for the convenience of the

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Exactly.

And then the

9

question is, once the United States has ceded the

10

easement, under 1382, can a person be prosecuted?

11

once the United States has ceded that easement, does it

12

violate the First Amendment, in light of this Court's

13

decision in Flower, to prosecute ­­

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And,

I thought you just

15

answered the question from Justice Sotomayor by saying,

16

no, no, the utility easement doesn't work because the

17

military commander has not granted permission to anybody

18

else to use that easement.

19

Here, we have a public road easement, and

20

you said that's different.

21

it's not, because the military commander has given

22

permission to use that easement.

23

what distinguishes the two cases.

24
25

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

And my question was:

No,

Now, I want to know

And this goes to

Justice Kennedy's question, earlier, if we are talking

46

about an easement.

2

3

to it.

4

An easement that is created for a

5

said an easement for a public road includes the right to

6

use it for speech purposes.

7

an easement that exists for purposes of the utility.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That is very different than

It seems to me a First

Amendment argument and not an argument that goes to the

10

scope of Section 1382.

11

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

No, Your Honor, because

12

you need to interpret the statute to avoid the

13

constitutional issues.

14

allow excluding speech on this public road easement in

15

the designated protest zone, then interpreting the

16

statute that way would raise grave First Amendment

17

issues.

9

otherwise, it would raise First Amendment problems.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, you are arguing that

the military cannot grant an easement across a military

12

installation for the purpose of allowing the public to

13

drive from a point, let's say, to the south to a point

14

to the north, without also granting an easement that

would allow people to linger along the road and engage

the sort of determination that's left to the military

commander.

So we are using the Rule of Lenity, relative

8

to interpreting the statute, and that's why we believe

9

that both, in terms of the statute and in terms of the

10

First Amendment, the Ninth Circuit should be affirmed.

11

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH

15
16
17
18

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HORWICH:

Thank you.

Just a couple of

points.
I ­­ I think the colloquy with my friend

19

sort of shows that taking this functional approach to

20

where the statute applies day­to­day, place­to­place, is

21

really just not going to prove workable.

22

to, remember, this is a misdemeanor prosecution.

23

is not something that should entail an extremely

24

extensive subtle inquiry that is going to vary from

25

place­to­place.

54
Alderson Reporting Company

And we have
This

Official

1

And So I think that that shows the wisdom of

2

what the Court said in the Benson case, which we quote

3

at page 15 and 16 of our reply brief, which explains.

4

It says that, "When a tract has been legally reserved

5

for military purposes, courts follow the action of the

6

political department of the government and will not

7

inquire what the actual use is to which any portion of the

8

reserve is temporarily put."

9

As for the Ninth Circuit's approach, which

10

is this sort of real estate based analysis, I think

11

there have been a number of hypotheticals offered that

12

show why that's going to produce some borderline absurd

13

or entirely absurd results.

14

And so that's why we come back to, again,

15

respecting the decision to place ­­ to place the

16

installation under military command and that

17

Section 1382 provides the sanction to enforce the orders

18

entered pursuant to that lawful command.

19

I might say one word about the green line

20

and its ­­ its relevance.

21

sort of the threshold across which 1382 applies or

22

doesn't apply.

23

the green line comes in a prosecution under the first

24

paragraph for violating a regulation.

25

My friend says that it is

The relevance in a 1382 prosecution of

At Joint Appendix 51, there's the

55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

commander's order closing the base, and what it says is,

2

"Pursuant to my authority, Vandenberg Air Force Base is

3

a closed base.

4

authority."

General rule covering the entire command

5

Paragraph 2, "The roadway easements through

6

Vandenberg have limited use as provided," et cetera, et

7

cetera.

8

and is subject to any rules and regulations the

9

installation commander may prescribe," and so forth.

10

"Use and occupation is for these purposes only

So what the green line is, is it's defining

11

the boundary between the closed base ­­ the generally

12

closed base ­­ and the road, which is open.

13

what ensures that someone who is driving on the road is

14

not committing an offense against the commander's

15

regulations, if they are just an ordinary member of the

16

public.

17

So that is

And, of course, if they cross over the line,

18

then they are violating the closed base regulation if

19

they don't have the commander's permission to cross that

20

line.

21

So the ­­ what is different, of course,

22

about Respondent is that he's been barred from the base,

23

so the rules that apply to the general public don't

24

apply to him.

25

second paragraph of Section 1382, is to recognize that

Of course, that's the very purpose of the

56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

commanders can make individualized determinations that

2

the rules that work, generally, for the public don't

3

work for particular people who show themselves to be

4

willing to vandalize government property or disobey the

5

instructions to remain within the areas that they may

6

lawfully be present in.

7
8
9

And, of course, that's the basis for why
Respondent was barred.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

10

question, Mr. Horwich?

11

Amendment area?

12

into being?

13

May I just ask a background
What's the history of this First

What ­­ when did this speech area come

MR. HORWICH:

There ­­ there was a

14

settlement of litigation with the commander in the late

15

1980s.

16

reproduced in the Joint Appendix ­­ which I guess shows

17

a couple things ­­ in which the commander agreed that there

18

would be a place on the base where ­­

19

It's in the ­­ it's reproduced ­­ part of it is

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Was the litigation

20

essentially like this one, basically saying that this

21

was not under military command?

22

MR. HORWICH:

To be honest, I'm not familiar

23

with the particular legal contentions there.

24

think what the settlement does show is that if it's the

25

commander who is authorizing this, the commander remains

57
Alderson Reporting Company

But I

Official

1

in charge of this.

2

And, of course, the current protest policy,

3

which is reproduced in the Joint Appendix, is quite

4

clear that the commander retains authority to ­­ and

5

control the time and place of the protests and, of

6

course, makes it clear that people who are barred can't

7

come back.

8
9

So on that point, with respect to the
constitutional avoidance argument, I think, as the Chief

10

Justice pointed out, it needs to be a serious

11

constitutional doubt.

12

said in Virginia against Hicks puts any of those doubts to

13

rest.

14

And I think what this Court has

The Court said, in that ­­ in that case,

15

that the First Amendment permits, quote, "The punishment

16

of a person who has, pursuant to lawful regulation, been

17

banned from a public park" ­­­ so I think a fortiori a

18

military base ­­ "after vandalizing it and who ignores

19

that ban in order to take part in a political

20

demonstration."

21

The Court has ­­ so the Court I think has

22

already settled this.

23

Thank you.

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
