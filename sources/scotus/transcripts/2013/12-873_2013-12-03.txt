ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN B. LOY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LOY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The standing trust for antitrust adopted by

12

this Court 30 years ago in AGC is the appropriate test

13

to give effect to Congress's intent under the Lanham

14

Act, and this is for three reasons.

15

First, the plain text of the Lanham Act at

16

Section 45 states that the intent of that Act is to

17

protect commercial actors against unfair competition.

18

Competition generally is the focus of both antitrust

19

statutes and the Lanham Act, and any test that this

20

Court adopts should be tied to that statutory intent

21

section.

22

Second, the history in the common law of

23

both antitrust statutes and the Lanham Act are similar.

24

In fact, in the Lanham Act context, the common law was

25

more specific and more direct than it was under the

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

antitrust statutes.

2

And, finally, each of the five ­­

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

The Lanham Act goes well

beyond the common law, doesn't it?

5

MR. LOY:

The ­­ the Lanham Act provides

6

some causes of action that are beyond the common law.

7

We think the prudential standing considerations that

8

were in place at common law or at least should guide the

9

Court in determining what Congress intended to do by

10
11

it ­­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

But that would be a

12

lot stronger if ­­ if you said the Lanham Act merely, as

13

the Sherman Act was supposed to have done, merely

14

adopted the common law.

15

adopt the common law.

16

MR. LOY:

The Lanham Act doesn't merely
It goes well beyond it.

I think there are two components

17

to the common law and ­­ and we'll ­­ and I'll talk now

18

about the most general component, and that are

19

considerations of proximate cause and foreseeability

20

that were in place when the Sherman and Tate Acts were

21

enacted.

22

Those are general propositions that apply

23

to ­­ to any, at least, Federal statutory cause of

24

action and would also apply then to the Lanham Act.

25

the AGC factors address those prudential standing

4
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

requirements about specifically asking about proximate

2

cause factors.

3

The very first question that AGC asks is:

4

Is this the type of injury Congress intended to address?

5

It's a logical question and should be asked

6

appropriately in any Federal statutory cause of action.

7

The second factor ­­

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

Tell me why the answer

to that question doesn't end this case here?

You're

10

disparaging the goods of a person.

11

it's illegal to use that person's products.

12

me that's the essence of the Lanham Act, as it's now

13

written.

14

MR. LOY:

Two points.

You're saying that
It seems to

First, we can talk

15

about the ­­ the alleged false advertisements in this

16

case.

17

was to Lexmark's customers, saying that you're bound by

18

this or use restriction on our cartridges.

19

advertisement does not mention Static Control at all.

The first alleged false advertisement by Lexmark

20

The second alleged false ­­

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22
23
24
25

all?

That

It doesn't mention what at

It doesn't ­­
MR. LOY:

It does not mention Static Control

at all, the Respondent.
The second alleged misrepresentation were

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

letters written to remanufacturers, saying to the

2

remanufacturers, if you remanufacture ­­ remanufacture

3

our cartridges, you will violate our rights, including

4

if you use Static Control's products to do it.

5

Beyond that, though, the question of target

6

is not a test.

7

Court, in the antitrust context, rejected a test for

8

antitrust standing called the target area test.

9

Conte Brothers, the Third Circuit decision that first

It's a conclusion.

And, in AGC, this

In

10

adopted the AGC test in the Lanham Act also did not

11

adopt a target area test.

12

And so, for that reason, we think the

13

factors that AGC lays out are the appropriate factors to

14

determine antitrust standing in any given case.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

I ­­ I assume you would

16

agree that the manufacturer of the cartridges that

17

compete with Lexmark would have standing here.

18

MR. LOY:

And, in fact, in this case, they

19

did have standing.

20

asserted a false advertising claim against Lexmark

21

related to the Prebate program.

22

And one of the remanufacturers

JUSTICE ALITO:

But it's not a very big step

23

from the manufacturer of the cartridge that competes to

24

the manufacturer of the chip, which is really the

25

essential component of ­­ or an essential component of

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the cartridge that competes.

2

MR. LOY:

Well, we ­­ we think it is.

And

3

wherever the Court draws the line on standing, whoever

4

is just on the other side of the line is always going to

5

think that it's too narrow.

6

Our cartridges, for instance, they do have

7

microchips on them.

8

Static Control does not sell cartridges.

9

cartridges also have resin, they have labels, they have

10

We do not sell the microchips.
Those

toner, they come in boxes.

11

If we allow one of many parts suppliers,

12

like Static, in the remanufacturing industry, to have

13

standing ­­

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, then you could ­­

15

you could sue them for infringing on your patent or

16

whatever intellectual property protection you have.

17

here is an entrepreneur that says, we make a product,

18

and Lexmark is disparaging our product.

19

essentially trying to get us out of this line of

20

business.

But

It is

21

Certainly, if you just read the words of the

22

Lanham Act, this is allegedly false advertising, and the

23

false advertiser shall be liable to any person who

24

believes he or she is likely to be damaged by such an

25

act.

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

That ­­ that legislation seems to envision a

2

very broad standing, certainly enough to encompass the

3

person who is ­­ whose product is being disparaged.

4

MR. LOY:

Certainly, the Lanham Act uses the

5

any person language and that language is no different,

6

though, than the any person language appears in the

7

antitrust statutes and in RICO, both instances in which

8

this Court adopted AGC tests to determine standing.

9

The one difference ­­ the one difference is

10

the Lanham Act, unlike the antitrust statutes, at

11

Section 45, specifically states its intent as to protect

12

commercial actors against unfair competition.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Suppose you have the ­­

14

shouldn't a supplier have standing to sue the competitor

15

of the firm to which he supplies, where the alleged

16

liable or slander or whatever it is, is directly about

17

what the supplier supplies?

18

The example, make it clearer.

Suppose that

19

Bailey's sells ice cream sundaes, and the defendant has

20

said the chocolate sauce in Bailey's ice cream sundaes

21

is poisonous.

22

with the defendant because he's an ice cream parlor,

23

but, nonetheless, he is directly affected by the

24

statement that he is suing about.

25

Now, the chocolate sauce does not compete

He is, therefore, different from the other

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

suppliers who might have supplied Bailey's with

2

cushions, heat, electricity.

3

that supplier of chocolate sauce have the standing to

4

bring a claim against the ice cream parlor that

5

competes with Bailey?

6
7

MR. LOY:

That supplier may very well have

standing to bring a State law claim for defamation.

8
9

But shouldn't at least

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why not ­­ why not in this

Lanham Act suit, why shouldn't the chocolate sauce

10

supplier have standing?

11

he has not just lost sales, but the comment is about

12

him.

13

MR. LOY:

He is directly victimized by ­­

We believe to give intent to

14

Section 45, which states that the purpose is unfair

15

competition, standing under the Lanham Act is going to

16

be a narrow, focused inquiry.

17

And if you ­­ using the cartridge example as an

18

example, if a supplier of microchips, who is one of many

19

suppliers in the market for microchips, has standing,

20

then couldn't the person who prints the label that sells

21

to remanufacturers by saying, well, if Lexmark hadn't

22

made these statements to you, you would have refilled

23

more cartridges, and we could have sold more labels.

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, the answer to your

question, if you're asking, is no, because the person

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

who supplies labels is totally ­­ the statement that is

2

sued about has nothing to do with labels.

3

who have nothing to do with the statement wouldn't have

4

standing.

So the people

5

But my ­­ do you remember my question?

6

MR. LOY:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

I do.
All right.

Well, why

8

shouldn't that person who is talked about in the

9

statement have standing?

10

A clear distinction.

Not

every supplier could sue.

11

MR. LOY:

We think Lanham Act does and

12

should have a narrow standing requirement.

13

false advertising context, it would be unusual ­­ Conte

14

Brothers pointed out that there might be situations

15

where a noncompetitor has standing, but that it's going

16

to be an unusual situation.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And in the

18

you think this standing doctrine is all about in a

19

context like this?

21

43.

22

You said before ­­ you said to

Is that what we're trying to do here?
MR. LOY:

I think so.

I think under ­­

23

under any standing analysis or test, one of the

24

questions ought to be, what was Congress' intent?

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, one of the questions.

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Why isn't that the only question that we ought to be

2

concerned with in a case like this?

3

right of action, and it seems to me that the normal

4

thing that we ought to do and do do in most contexts is

5

just say, you know, what's the scope of that right of

6

action?

7

Congress creates a

And ­­ and certainly we could take into

8

account Congress' purposes in interpreting the scope of

9

that right of action.

10

MR. LOY:

But that would be the question.
That should always be a question.

11

I would point out there are only two tests that have

12

been identified that even ask that question in the

13

Lanham Act, and that is the AGC test that we propose and

14

the categorical test that we propose in the alternative,

15

because it categorically requires direct competition.

16

None of the other tests that have been

17

identified ask that question, and it should be

18

asked in every inquiry.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess, if that's the

20

question, the AGC test strikes me as not the answer to

21

that question.

22

Congress' intent, how broad did Congress mean for this

23

cause of action to go, and then sort of devise a

24

five­part test with a lot of things that aren't

25

mentioned in the statute.

I mean, we don't usually say what was

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. LOY:

I think that the ­­ this Court's

2

decision in Holmes, and I believe it was the concurrence

3

by Justice Scalia, identified the proximate cause

4

factors as part of any standing analysis.

5

that's what AGC was getting at when it adopted factors 2

6

through 5, is these are proximate cause type injuries,

7

plus, as AGC noted, we want to make it judicially

8

manageable, which is a legitimate prudential standing

9

concern because one of the prudential background

And I think

10

considerations is whether ­­ the prohibition on

11

litigating generalized grievances.

12

So a test that looks at those proximate

13

cause factors, which are part of, we think, a standing

14

analysis in any statutory scheme, is appropriate, and it

15

ensures that the plaintiff and the defendant are in

16

close proximity to one another.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Except there are two

18

remedies under this statute, injunctive relief and

19

damages.

20

limits the recovery on damages, it doesn't limit

21

injunctive relief issues.

22

And to the extent that proximate cause always

And so the question is, why should we be

23

reading into a statute a limitation against bringing any

24

action based on your proximate cause point when there

25

are other remedies in this statute?

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. LOY:

And just as there are injunctive

2

remedies available in the antitrust statute and in this

3

Court's decision in Cargill, I think, in a footnote, the

4

Court noted that, if all you have is an injunctive

5

request under antitrust statutes, some of those factors

6

may not be relevant.

7

For instance, duplicative damages, risk of

8

apportionment issues would not ­­ Your Honor is

9

correct – be relevant.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But proximate cause?

What

11

about proximate cause?

12

there's no proximate cause analysis when what is at

13

issue is an injunction?

14
15

MR. LOY:

No.

What we were saying is some

of the factors that AGC identifies, such as ­­

appropriate in an injunctive analysis to look at the

proximity of the plaintiff and the defendant.

5

defendant ­­ my product, not someone else's ­­ the

6

result is that I am losing business.

Here is a manufacturer

Why do we need anything more than that under

the Lanham Act, which makes false advertising ­­ gives a

claim for false advertising to somebody who's been hurt

MR. LOY:

Again, there ­­ there very well

12

could be State law remedies available to plaintiffs who

13

do not have standing under the Lanham Act.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I'm not asking about

15

State law remedies.

16

your interpretation seems to stray very far from what

I'm looking at this statute, and

MR. LOY:

We agree they make that

But in the Lanham Act, where we

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Lanham Act is there is prudential standing

2

consideration, and Congress has not expressly negated

3

those.

4

So the question is what test to apply.

We

5

think the Lanham Act is a limited, focused statutory

6

remedy.

7

It's not a Federal tort of deceit.

8

this ­­ of the statute expressly is to protect

9

commercial actors against unfair competition, not

It's not a Federal tort of misrepresentation.
The purpose of

against unfair trade practices.

11

And so to ­­ to use the ­­ or take advantage

12

of the Federal courts in the Lanham Act, which has

13

potential for treble damages and attorneys fees, we

14

think it's a narrow class of plaintiffs.

15

unlike the antitrust context, there's no intent

16

requirement under the Lanham Act.

17

Particularly,

One could be liable for damages under the

18

Lanham Act for an innocent misrepresentation, one that

19

they thought, at the time, was truthful, which would

20

argue, perhaps, for more limited standing than either ­­

21

than even the antitrust statutes because there is an

22

intent element under the antitrust statutes.

23

standing should be more limited in this situation.

24

Again, it's a ­­ it's a narrow, focused

25

statutory remedy.

And so the

And unlike RICO, unlike Sherman,

15
Alderson Reporting Company

2

think guides the courts or should guide the courts on

3

which test to adopt.

11

MR. LOY:

Well, again, on the alleged facts

of this case ­­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.

That's what we

12

have ­­ and we have to deal with the complaint and

13

have to assume that that's true.

14

alleges is that Static was making a product and Lexmark

15

was disparaging it and not by happenstance, but quite

16

deliberately.

17

MR. LOY:

What the complaint

18

characterization of ­­ of their counterclaim.

their ­­ the advertisements here were directed to the

What it first says to the

remanufacturers is that if you remanufacture our

5

6

But merely because one is a target, we do

7

not believe it necessarily translates into standing.

8

did not translate into standing in the AGC case; the

9

union was the target, and this Court, nevertheless,

10

It

denied standing.

11

The Fifth Circuit decision, the Procter &

Gamble decision, which involved Procter & Gamble and

13

Amway; there, the parties were actually competitors.

14

And because of the nature of the statements that ­­ that

15

Procter & Gamble allegedly made about compensation to

16

Amway's distributors and how they get distributors,

17

there, they were actually direct competitors, and

18

standing was not provided, which, again, we think just

19

reinforces that this is a narrow statutory remedy.

But, here, it merely asked the question.

We

2

think AGC provides the answer to that question.

3

zone of interest has been largely used in the APA

4

context, and it's ­­ it's appropriate in ­­ in that

5

context.

6

And the

There's a two­step inquiry under the APA.

First, the APA itself is a procedural act,

7

but, then, you have to go to the underlying substantive

8

statute to determine who a party is ­­ what party is

9

agreeing.

The zone of interest, therefore, has to

10

administer hundreds, if not thousands, of very different

11

federal substantive statutes, and so some flexibility

12

needs to be inherent in ­­ in that test.

13

If such a test were employed, we think, in

14

the Lanham Act, we could lead to over­enforcement, which

15

has its own set of harms.

16

deter companies from putting even truthful information

17

into the marketplace, for fear of facing lawsuits by

18

remote parts suppliers.

19

We don't think you want to

And ­­ and so, in this instance, we think

20

the AGC test itself provides the answer to the question

21

of what is in ­­ in the zone of interest.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what's wrong ­­

23

what's wrong with the tests adopted by three circuits,

24

the reasonable interest test?

25

MR. LOY:

We think it suffers from, in this

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

instance ­­ because, here, we have ­­ we have the Lanham

2

Act.

We can tailor a ­­ a standing test to the Lanham

3

Act.

Reasonable interest suffers, we think, from

4

the same flaws in this context, as would the zone of

5

interest test.

6

It's no more than Article III standing.

7

Anybody that can plead a reasonable interest in the

8

subject matter of the ­­ of the advertisement and a

9

reasonable basis for believing that interest is harmed,

10

then that's no more than Article III standing

11

requirement.

12

And we do, in this case, believe that there

13

is universal recognition that there should be prudential

14

standing requirements in the Lanham Act and provides

15

little guidance to courts below and, therefore, could

16

lead to inconsistent results.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. ­­ Mr. Loy, you said

18

there's universal recognition that there should be

19

prudential standing requirements in the Lanham Act.

20

When should there be prudential standing requirements in

21

a statutory right of action?

22

In other words, Congress passes lots of

23

statutory rights of action.

24

never, never does Congress talk about prudential

25

standing one way or the other.

And let's say that almost

1

Do you think that, every time Congress

2

passes a right of action, the courts are supposed to

3

engage in a kind of free­form inquiry about what kind of

4

prudential standing rule should apply to that particular

5

right of action?

6

MR. LOY:

We think, in any federal statutory

7

cause of action, prudential standing requirements are

8

presumed.

9

Lanham Act clearly does have prudential standing

10
11

Given Section 45 here, we believe that the

requirements.
This Court in Bennett, in looking at the

12

Endangered Species Act, at least the stand­alone

13

citizenry portion of it, I believe determined that

14

Congress eschewed prudential standing requirements there

15

because the ­­ the subject matter of the Act was the

16

environment, something that I think the Court noted

17

everybody has an interest in and ­­ and want to

18

encourage private attorney generals to pursue those

19

causes of action.

20

And, in that situation, there was a right of

21

first refusal for the government to first bring the

22

lawsuit before a private suit could be brought.

23

there are times when prudential standing requirements

24

have been done away with by Congress.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So

And ­­ and you just sort of

20

know them when you see them, or it's a reaction to what

2

are perceived to be very broad statutes or ­­ you know,

3

when ­­ when do we know that we should be off on a

4

prudential standing jag?

5

MR. LOY:

I think ­­ I think that the ­­ the

6

first place you look is at the text of the statute

7

itself.

8

legislative history might speak to intent ­­ and I think

9

Clarke says, let's look at that.

To the extent that there are situations where

In this situation, the 1946 Act and the

11

Senate report that accompanied it said, this is the

12

purpose to ­­ this is the end to which this statute was

13

directed, and it identified fair competition and the

14

prevention of diversion of goodwill from one to the

15

other.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Maybe the answer is

17

when we just can't believe that Congress really meant

18

the literal words of the statute to be interpreted

19

without some limiting principle.

20

says, "any person," and any person surely includes

21

people who purchase printer cartridges.

22

So, here, Congress

So if we don't think that ­­ that Congress

23

really meant for every single person who purchases a

24

printer cartridge to be able to file a claim in Federal

25

court with no amount in controversy requirement, then

21
Alderson Reporting Company

1

that would be a situation where some consideration of

2

prudential standing would have to take place.

3

MR. LOY:

That's correct.

"Any person"

4

language here would allow consumer standing, which is

5

one thing that every circuit that's addressed this issue

6

has agreed upon, that there is no consumer standing

7

under the Lanham Act.

8
9

Again, that's tied to Section 45, which
protects commercial actors ­­

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, there, couldn't that be

11

done just by interpreting the ­­ the language of the

12

statue, in accord with its purposes, because you have a

13

specific purpose provision in the Lanham Act that says,

14

we're ­­ we're trying to get at commercial competition

Mr. Jones.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMESON R. JONES

7
8
9
10

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As some of this questioning indicated, if

11

any party has standing under Section 43(a) of the Lanham

12

Act, it's a party whose goods are misrepresented in

13

false advertising.

14

question, Congress amended the statute in 1988 to ensure

15

a cause of action when a false advertiser misrepresents

16

the goods or commercial services of, quote, "another

17

person," end quote.

18

To remove any doubt about that

This Court's zone of interest analysis shows

19

that parties whose goods are disparaged, either

20

expressly or by necessary implication, must have

21

standing to sue.

22

Lexmark's simply wrong about the idea that

23

the zone of interest analysis in the Lanham Act does not

24

pose limits upon who may sue.

25

with respect to the Bailey's ice cream parlor shows, you

As the hypothetical

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

can look to the subject matter of the false

2

advertisement to see whose goodwill and commercial

3

activities are related to the falsity of the statement.

4

And those who come within the falsity and

5

the subject matter of the advertisement at issue should

6

have standing, while those who may have tangential

7

injuries would not.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How do you ­­ how do you

square that with the statutory provision that the

10

purpose of the law is to prevent unfair competition?

11

Unfair competition, not unfair trade practices.

12

competition.

13

MR. JONES:

Unfair

Where Section 45 says that it is

14

designed to protect those engaged in such commerce from

15

unfair competition, it's referring to what is defined in

16

the operative text as unfair trade practices.

17

competition involves specific measures, use of

18

falsities, that can injure parties who are not

19

necessarily in competition with one another.

Unfair

20

The courts, as a whole, all agree that a

21

competition requirement cannot be inferred into the

22

false association cause of action that is also unfair

23

competition that's part of Section 43(a).

24
25

Section 43(a) goes to commercial activity.
There is unfair competition in the sense that all of the

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

activity under it is commercial and competitive in that

2

sense.

3

plaintiff and a defendant, for the purposes of standing,

4

is inconsistent with the structure of Section 43(a) and

5

the text of the authorizing paragraph.

6

But some narrow form of competition between a

7

case only disparaged the cartridges themselves and not

10

MR. JONES:

Yes, if the statements are about

11

the legality of remanufacturing Lexmark's printer

12

cartridges, all of those statements are about Static

13

Control's products and the legality of using them, the

14

places where those can be lawfully used.

15

Static Control here makes microchips and

16

parts that are specifically designed for the very

17

commercial activity that this false advertising says is

18

illegal.

19

commercial relationships are all very closely and, by

20

necessary implication, talked about in the

21

advertisements.

22

In that sense, Static Control's goodwill and

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that may be true, but

23

I don't understand how you get from the zone of interest

24

to the limiting principle that you are suggesting, which

25

is that the zone of interest includes only those

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

businesses, other than the direct competitor, whose

2

products are targeted by the false statements.

3

MR. JONES:

As Mr. Loy recognized, in the ­­

4

in the legislative history of the Act and in this

5

Court's opinion in Daystar, the Court has said the core

6

principle of the Lanham Act, as a whole, is to protect

7

commercial actors' goodwill and reputation, and that can

8

be seen in the trademark provisions.

9

Section 43(a) itself.

It can be seen in

10

And I think that basic principle means that

11

there is a tie to the subject matter of the false

12

statements, the false association, and that can apply to

13

both prongs of Section 43(a), to where there is a nexus

14

between the subject matter of what's talked about and

15

the person who is injured.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Did you answer his

17

question?

18

of how the disparagement of the ­­ of the composite

19

product is automatically a disparagement of your chip.

20

I'm still left with a lack of understanding

MR. JONES:

The disparagement ­­ the

21

statements about the uses to which Static Control's

22

products may be put are all implicit in all of the false

23

advertisements that are at issue in this case.

24
25

When Lexmark says that remanufacturing our
cartridges is illegal, even if it doesn't mention Static

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Control in one particular advertisement, all of that

2

goes to the subject matter and to whether or not Static

3

Control's products have lawful uses.

4

These are specifically designed for this

5

very commercial activity.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

Well, to change

7

it, suppose the statements don't implicitly ­­ even

8

implicitly target Static Control, but the effect of the

9

statements is to drive Static Control out of business.

10
11

You would say there would be no standing there?
MR. JONES:

It depends upon the context of

12

the case.

13

advertising is not about a product, those products will

14

have multiple different uses, such as commodity products

15

that are supplied, gears and springs, for example, that

16

may have many different uses, the false statements here

17

would not be about those products.

18

In many circumstances where the false

And those manufacturers can sell their gears

19

to many other different uses that require gears.

20

Control's microchips here only work for remanufacturing

21

Lexmark printer cartridges.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

Static

So, in Justice

23

Breyer's hypothetical about the soda fountain that sells

24

ice cream with chocolate sauce and there is a statement

25

that the chocolate sauce is poisonous, if the effect of

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that is to drive out of business a little company that

2

manufactures ice cream that's used there, that company

3

would not have standing?

4

MR. JONES:

I think if it's not being talked

5

about in that case, that company probably would not have

6

standing.

7

that case were about the chocolate sauce shows that ­­

8

why the chocolate maker needs to have standing.

9

maker has different incentives vis­a­vis the person who

10

But the fact that the false advertisements in

That

is operating the Bailey's ice cream store.

11

Bailey's ice cream store could decide the

12

game's not worth the candle, and we're going to stop

13

buying this chocolate, even if all of those

14

advertisements are false.

15

incentives for the key supplier and the person who is

16

actually within direct competition means that, to

17

further the purposes of the Lanham Act, a party whose

18

goods are misrepresented, either expressly or by

19

necessary implication, needs to have standing.

20

And so the different

24

sauce, then Bailey's is out.

25

That would be similar to this

But, if other places also sold this chocolate

MR. JONES:

In the hypothetical that I heard

29
Alderson Reporting Company

1

from Justice Breyer, the statement was, the chocolate

2

sauce that Bailey's uses is ­­ is poisonous.

circumstance, where both Bailey's is mentioned and the

chocolate sauce, then I think Bailey's would have to

5

have standing.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

(Laughter.)

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

11
12
13

How do we tie that in?

I'm

sort of sorry I used that hypothetical because it ­­

8

10

In that

But it nonetheless

illustrates ­­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

I am, too, because I'm sick

of it.
JUSTICE BREYER:

But it illustrates the

14

point.

15

designed to answer, are you the kind of plaintiff that

16

Congress intended, in this statute, to protect against

17

the kind of injury that you say you suffered?

18

goes back to Justice Brandeis, and it goes back to

19

saying, did you suffer a common law injury, or do you

20

fall within the scope as defined?

21

I mean, in my own mind, the standing question is

Now, that

Normally, Congress doesn't think about that,

22

and so courts decide, and we're right in the middle of

23

that decision.

24

a point, that at least the supplier who is mentioned in

25

the defamatory statement by the competitor who bought

So if I think that, basically, you have

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the supplies, at least where he is mentioned explicitly,

2

there should be standing, which means your side would

3

win, I guess.

4

What do I write to tie that in to the three

5

separate kinds of tests that the circuits have talked

6

about?

7

about the reasonable interest test, they talk about the

8

zone of interest test, they talk about some other kind

9

of test.

That's what I can't quite see because they talk

10

How do I tie this into that?

11

MR. JONES:

Justice Breyer, we think,

12

respectfully, that the circuits' tests don't necessarily

13

encompass this situation as well as they could, which is

14

why we suggest that it's best for the Court to step back

15

to first principles of prudential standing, which is the

16

zone of interest analysis ­­

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Has that been applied

18

outside the context of the APA, that is, when the suit

19

is against an agency?

20

MR. JONES:

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22
23

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.
Has it been applied to

private party litigation?
MR. JONES:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

In 2011,

24

this Court's opinion in Thompson v. North American

25

Stainless applied the zone of interest test to a private

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

dispute under Title VII, as to whether or not a party in

2

that suit had a private cause of action when he was the

3

spouse of the person who was retaliated against.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

If that's so ­­ if you go

5

back and you just lift the APA test ­­ because I think

6

Justice Ginsburg is absolutely right, that this is not

7

an APA suit ­­ the word "arguably" was inserted in the

8

normal standing test by ADAPSO, which Justice Douglas

9

wrote.

10

Now, if we take that and simply lift it, the

11

first thing, the person who would get a new lawsuit, I

12

guess, is a consumer, because the consumer could easily

13

say, I didn't buy this product because of the false

14

statement that the competitor of the person I would have

15

bought from made.

16

And, indeed, you could have very big

17

consumers, and they could allege all kinds of injuries.

18

And so, if I simply lift the test, I’d rather worry that I

19

am changing the law quite radically.

20

MR. JONES:

I don't think so, Justice

21

Breyer, because the zone of interest test requires the

22

Court to determine what the purposes behind the statute

23

are.

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

But "arguably."

arguably, in part, to protect consumers?

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Isn't it

1

MR. JONES:

Well, in the ­­ in the Lanham

2

Act, I think the purposes of the Act are to protect

3

those engaged in such commerce from unfair competition,

4

from false statements.

5

you look at the history of it, and it seems fairly clear

6

from the history that it is designed to protect

7

commercial actors.

8

who are arguably within that zone, who arguably assert

9

those interests, should have standing.

And once that is defined ­­ and

Once that is defined, those parties

10

And that "arguably" term places the proper

11

thumb on the scales with respect to what is otherwise

that, generally, it respects the role of the judiciary

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What do you see as the

16

difference between reasonable interest and zone of

17

interest?

18

what the difference is between the two.

19

What do you ­­ I haven't quite understood

MR. JONES:

Justice Sotomayor, I believe the

20

zone of interest test can have some more teeth,

21

perhaps, than the reasonable interest test because it

22

tailors what is the interest protected to the text and

23

history of the particular statute.

24

The reasonable interest test, if properly

25

applied, with all of that in mind, would, I think, be

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

applied in similar ways.

2

has the directive to courts that, each time, rather than

3

thinking what is reasonable in the abstract, to think

4

about what Congress intended to protect as part of any

5

given statute.

6

But the zone of interest test

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose that Lexmark had not

7

made disparaging comments about Static Control, but had

8

simply made false statements about its own product.

9

Suppose it said that, if you use our products ­­ our

10

cartridges, they will emit some sort of vapor in your

11

house that will promote good health.

12
13
14

Who would be within the zone of interest
there?
MR. JONES:

So you would look at the subject

15

matter of that ­­ of that false advertisement, and, as

16

you've expressed it, I don't believe that Static

17

Control's products would be within the subject matter

18

about the vapor of Lexmark's printer cartridges.

19

But if, for example, Lexmark were to say,

20

our printer cartridges produce A quality ­­ A quality

21

print jobs, then ­­ and it's implicitly talking about

22

its toner, Static Control, as a manufacturer of toner,

23

may have standing in that circumstance because, by

24

comparison, by necessary understanding about how the

25

reputations of the parties' products are at play, Static

34
Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

Control might have standing in that instance.

Who would be within the zone

situation?

Only ­­ would other printer cartridge

MR. JONES:

In that situation, I think

7

remanufacturers would and the supplier of toners that is

8

necessarily by comparison talked about in that false

9

advertisement.

10

And, when a party only talks about their own

11

goods, they are necessarily going to be very difficult

12

cases on the margins as to where the ripples of the

13

subject matter of that false advertisement extend.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The question, in your

10

view, is Congress passes this Act; did Congress ­­ in

11

including this right of action, did Congress want this

12

kind of actor to be able to use that right of action?

13

Is that correct?

14

MR. JONES:

Yes, yes.

And, in the 1988

15

amendments that expanded the cause of action to ensure a

16

right of action when a false advertiser misstates

17

another person's goods, that amendment should be

18

dispositive in this case.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, if that's correct, I

20

mean, rather than talking about whether something is

21

arguably within the zone of interests in the way we have

22

to do, in the APA context, because we are dealing with a

23

lot of statutes that don't provide rights of action

What would we say the Lanham Act means?
MR. JONES:

The Lanham Act means that those

10

parties whose goodwill and commercial reputation is

11

necessarily affected by the falsity of the statement

12

have standing to sue, are protected by the Lanham Act

13

and able to stop such false advertisements and able to

14

seek recompense for the damages that are suffered.

15

And at the heart of that are those parties

16

whose goodwill and whose commercial services are

17

expressly misrepresented or implicitly misrepresented by

18

a particular false advertisement because they have a

19

unique interest in vindicating their reputations and

20

making the false advertisements stop.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So what makes this limit

22

a prudential limit?

notion of a prudential limit is there is Article III

I think it's perhaps better

6

But whether it's thought of as prudential

7

standing or whether Static Control falls within "any

8

person" or has "injuries" as meant by the statute, the

9

inquiry is ultimately the same.

Could you tell me how

that would affect a situation that I read about in the

papers, where a company like ­­ not to suggest that they

19

ground to sue in that situation?

Assume that's absolutely true ­­

Who would be ­­ who would have a permissible

MR. JONES:

I think, in that situation, you

would look to Burger King would have a cause of action,

3

probably even Subway, because they are a fast food

4

company that advertises itself as based upon

5

lower­calorie options, would have a standing to sue in

6

that context.

7
8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So fit in

that into your definition of what "standing" is ­­

9

MR. JONES:

10

So ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ how do we not get it

11

to be the local ­­ or maybe you say it's okay ­­ the ­­

12

the local restaurant that has no franchises, that does

13

healthy meals, which is actually true of many

14

restaurants today, particularly in Washington.

15

MR. JONES:

Sure.

So, in each of those

16

contexts, Subway and Burger King can say that their

17

goodwill ­­ their relative standing in the marketplace

18

has been necessarily affected by McDonald's false

19

advertisements on those subjects.

20

And, if you get to looking at pleadings,

21

courts would look to whether or not the allegations that

22

set that forth are plausible and meet that standard,

23

but ­­ and how far out that's going to go is for another

24

day.

courts to say that you do need to allege that sort of

But I do believe it would be permissible for

harm to goodwill or comparative standing in the

2

marketplace for the standing to exist under the Act.

3

Lexmark's requests that the Court import

4

into the Lanham Act rules from the antitrust context

5

should not be countenanced.

6

incorporated the common law itself, as this Court said

7

in Leegin, in ­­ in a way that, when Congress prescribed

8

a very broad set of actions that could not mean what it

9

said, Congress necessarily anticipated that there would

10

be some judicial policymaking and common law rulemaking

11

as to the scope of a cause of action and who can sue

12

under it.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

The antitrust laws

But, now, does that ­­ just

14

thinking of Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical, that

15

suggests that maybe the reasonable interest test is okay

16

because what that's trying to do is ­­ you have

17

McDonald's that's allegedly made the false statement,

18

and then there are a range of people in terms more or

19

less distant in respect to being direct competitors.

20

There is ­­ what you said, Burger King,

21

direct competitor, then there are the health

restaurants.

cut off at some point the plaintiff, who claims to be a

I think we would be happy with that result.

think that it looks ­­ it's perhaps a little bit better

MR. JONES:

And that is precisely why, in

5

our brief, we do believe that it would be better for the

6

Court to step back to that level and talk about the

7

interests in protecting goodwill and commercial actors'

8

standing in the marketplace vis­a­vis the subject matter

9

of the false advertising.

Your zone of interests ­­

Ginsburg.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Your zone of interest, in

15

response to Justice Scalia, would establish another tier

16

of zone of interest.

The ­­ arguably, within the zone

17

And you said, here, you could

18

strike "arguably" and just have it within the zone.

19

MR. JONES:

The Court said, in Bennett v.

20

Spear, that how the zone of interest will apply will

21

depend upon the text and history of the statute, and it

22

will vary somewhat based upon the statutory text and

23

context.

24

Court can look to what Congress meant to protect as

25

that, and I believe that once those interests are

And if, for different types of statutes, the

42
Alderson Reporting Company

defined, the "arguably" language does mean that in a

2

close case parties should have standing because that's

3

generally what ­­ when courts do, when they are

4

interpreting otherwise clear statutory text, I think the

5

deference should be to the words that Congress passed in

6

a close case.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

"Arguably" could refer to

8

factual matters; that is, you ­­ you are within the zone

9

of interest if certain facts are established.

And, if

10

you don't establish those facts, you are not.

That's

11

how I've always understood the "arguably."

12

think it means ­­ you know, "close enough for government

13

work."

14

I don't

It doesn't mean that.

It means you ­­ you are within the zone of

15

interest if, indeed, these facts that you have asserted

16

exist.

17

MR. JONES:

And that understanding of the

18

word, Justice Scalia, would fit with this Court's

19

pleading rules and whether or not somebody has plausibly

20

pled that certain facts that would show that the test is

21

met.

And I think that would make sense in this context.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

1

2

if you kind ­­ you know, we weren't going to be too

3

4

because the way the APA works is it's on top of a lot of

5

federal statutes that have no rights of action

themselves.

7

And the reason we did that, again, is

But this is a very different situation.

12

This is a situation where we have a particular right of

action.

around it, we should just ask how is it sensible to

15

interpret that right of action?

16

And rather than create any kind of buffer zone

MR. JONES:

Two responses to that, Justice

Kagan.

18

you are looking at prudential standing in this Court's

19

doctrines.

20

abrogated limits on suit that courts had erected at the

21

common law, to say that a certain cause of action is not

22

going to be available to a particular plaintiff, I do

23

believe courts need to be careful in applying prudential

24

rules to avoid resurrecting those same policy concerns

25

that had led courts to say that no cause of action

I do believe that may be one way to look at how

In certain contexts, where Congress has

44
Alderson Reporting Company

1

existed in the first place.

2

And so, I think, at least in this context,

3

where you have a brand­new cause of action that did not

4

exist at the common law, that "arguably" language may be

5

more appropriate than with respect to a different

6

statute where there are different issues at stake.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Am I correct to think that

8

your rule is that the only people who have standing

under the Lanham Act are competitors and people whose

rule?

I'm trying to see am I forgetting someone that ­­ that

18

your reading of the cases suggests has been given

20

MR. JONES:

I mean, I'm trying to see ­­

So one example that may clarify

21

this with Justice Alito's question about competition is

22

the Proctor & Gamble case that Mr. Loy talked about.

23

That was a false advertisement that Amway made about the

24

lucrativeness of being an employee of Amway.

25

Proctor & Gamble is a direct competitor, but

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

should not have standing to sue for those false

2

statements because it's not related to Amway's

3

statements about how much they pay to their employees.

4

The subject matter doesn't go to that ­­ that competitor

5

and that competitor's product.

6

And so I think it's better to look at it in

7

terms of where ­­ what the falsity of the statement is

8

and how close or far a particular plaintiff is to that

9

statement, rather than trying to get at it through

10

competition.

11

Does that help, Justice Breyer?

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Am I correct that no

13

circuit has adopted the zone of interest test in the

14

context of the Lanham Act?

15

MR. JONES:

No circuit has adopted it as the

16

test for the Lanham Act.

17

about zone of interest policies, and there are cases

18

that talk about the interests of protecting goodwill and

19

the reputation of companies who are involved in

20

interstate commerce.

21

There are cases that talk

But the other tests that courts have layered

22

on to it, I think, don't necessarily get at the direct

23

question that is really at issue, which is did Congress

24

really intend for these injuries to be the subject of a

25

cause of action.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So what's wrong with

2

the ­­ what is it ­­ AGC, the antitrust standard?

3

it's got five things.

4

that maybe that's more generous to finding standing

5

than ­­ than the reasonable interest.

6

MR. JONES:

So

And Justice Alito just suggested

The experience ­­ Justice

7

Ginsburg, the experience of the courts would show that

8

applying agency actually would be more restrictive, I

9

believe, than a zone of interest analysis.

Two of the

10

factors from the AGC test are facially inconsistent with

11

the Lanham Act.

12

The concerns about the speculativeness of

13

damages, at least as it relates to quantum, and the

14

concern about the complexity and apportionment and

15

duplicative damages cannot be applied here in a statute

16

where Congress explicitly abrogated limits on suit

17

related to certainty of damages.

18

talks about a cause of action to somebody who's likely

19

injured, that shows that those concerns about damages

20

should not be applied.

21

Section 43(a), when it

Similarly, the flexibility and the remedy

22

that can be recovered under the Lanham Act, in terms of

23

disgorgement remedies, injunctive relief, and a party's

factors shouldn't be applied either.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN B. LOY

4
5

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LOY:

I have three short points.

The

6

straightforward question for this Court is what test to

7

apply for Lanham Act.

8

On the facts of this case, we believe that the district

9

court, in analyzing these facts, got it correct when it

10

found that Static did not have standing under that test

11

and when it found that Static was not a target, like the

12

Sixth Circuit actually found that Static was not a

13

target.

14

And we believe AGC is that test.

Second point, through the entire

15

briefing and at, now, oral argument, I ­­ I still have

16

not heard ­­ we have not heard how Static Control is

17

conceptually any different than the union was in AGC.

18

And that just goes to show the target is not always the

19

inquiry.

20

Third point, if this Court ­­

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm sorry.

You used

22

"target" twice.

23

and the other time, you said it was, but it ­­ target

24

isn't a test.

25

MR. LOY:

Once, you said SCC was not a target,

I'm sorry.

What I intended to

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

say, and if I misspoke, I apologize, the district court

2

found that the SCC lacked standing.

3

found that SCC was not a target, although the Sixth

4

Circuit decided that a different test should be used,

5

the Sixth Circuit also found that Static Control was not

6

a target.

7
8
9

The district court

My final point is if this Court ­­ I'm
sorry.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Explain that.

Because,

10

if we accept the allegation of the complaint as true,

11

the allegation is that Static's product was disparaged,

12

that remanufacturers were told, don't use this product

13

because, if you do, you're going to be involved in

14

infringement.

15

MR. LOY:

The ­­ Static Control's

16

counterclaim never alleges target.

17

fact, that the remanufacturers were the ones whose

18

activities we were trying to ­­ to direct.

19

Court were to adopt a zone of interest test, it would be

20

the first time this Court has adopted that test outside

21

the APA or APA­like context.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

23
24
25

And it alleges, in

If this

Well, was Title VII an

APA ­­ when I asked Mr. Jones?
MR. LOY:

If Title ­­ no, it was not an APA,

but the language for standing that the Court analyzed is

50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

party aggrieved.

2

the similarity of that language to ­­ the language in the

3

APA and there ­­ thereby justified using that test in

4

that case with similar statutory language.

5

The Court then looked at

I think opposing counsel said that they ­­

6

that under their zone of interest test, any person whose

7

products or services are expressly or implicitly

8

implicated should have standing under the Lanham Act.

9

We think that goes too far.

10

If there are no further questions.
