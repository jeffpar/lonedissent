ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BURSCH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

The issue in this case is whether a Michigan

12

constitutional provision requiring equal treatment

13

violates equal protection.

14

answer is no.

15

And for two reasons, the

First, unlike the laws at issue in Hunter

16

and Seattle, Section 26 does not repeal an

antidiscrimination law.

18

preferential treatment, not equal treatment.

20

Instead, it repeals

to Seattle?

Justice Sotomayor, it's not

Alderson Reporting Company

In Seattle, they

1

were trying to create, in the court's words, equal

2

educational opportunity by imposing a remedy that would

3

result in equality in the schools.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You don't think that the

5

proponents of affirmative action are attempting to do

6

the same thing?

7

this constitutional amendment will bring back

8

desegregation in Michigan, and it appears to have done

9

just that.

10

MR. BURSCH:

One of the bill sponsors here said that

Well, there's two points to

11

that question and I'll address them both.

12

merits, under Grutter, the point of preferences in

13

university admissions cannot be solely the benefit of

14

the minority because under Grutter, it's supposed to

15

benefit the campus as a whole through diversity, and

16

which we think is a laudable goal.

17

First on the

It's a forward­looking action, not a

18

backward­looking action, to remedy past discrimination.

19

And we know that because under Grutter, you can use

20

preferences whether or not there's de facto or de jure

21

segregation, simply to get the benefit.

22

But with respect to your ­­ your point about

23

the University of Michigan and what has or has not

24

happened here, two thoughts on that.

25

statistics that we discuss in our reply brief where it's

4
Alderson Reporting Company

First, we have the

not clear that ­­ that the diversity on Michigan's

2

campus has gone down.

3

is not those numbers, but the fact that there are other

4

things that the University of Michigan could be doing to

5

achieve diversity in race­neutral ways.

6

For example, we know that ­­

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But our main point on that is ­­

I ­­ I thought that in

8

Grutter, all of the social scientists had pointed out to

9

the fact that all of those efforts had failed.

That's

10

one of the reasons why the ­­ I think it was a law

11

school claim in Michigan was upheld.

12

MR. BURSCH:

Well, there's social science

13

evidence that goes both ways.

14

the University of Michigan because there's two things

15

that they could be doing right now that would get them

16

closer to the race­neutral goal.

17

But I want to focus on

The first thing is that they could eliminate

2

changing every few years for minorities.

3

It seems that the game posts keeps

MR. BURSCH:

Given the makeup of Michigan's

4

alumni right now, certainly that playing field would be

5

tilted the other way.

6

The other thing that we press is

7

socioeconomic diversity.

8

Michigan, there was a stat in "The Wall Street Journal"

9

just two days ago that if you measure that by Pell

And at the University of

10

grants, the number of students who are eligible for

11

those, at the University of Michigan the number of

12

students who have Pell grants is half what it is at more

13

progressive institutions like Berkeley and the

14

University of Texas at Austin.

15

So the University of Michigan could be

16

trying harder.

17

about whether preferences are a good or bad thing

18

because that's not what this case is about.

19

question is whether the people of Michigan had the

20

choice through the democratic process to accept this

21

Court's invitation in Grutter to try race­neutral means.

22
23
24
25

But our point isn't to get into a debate

15

And I think the chart

And that's

But I think the more fundamental basis is to

16

say, you know, what Seattle is about.

17

indulge me, I'm going to suggest that Seattle could mean

one of three things.

clearly reject, and then the other two I think are ­­

20

are possible interpretations that you could adopt.

When Seattle talks about racial

22

classifications, it focuses on laws that have a racial

23

focus.

24

about people, not about laws, but even more

25

fundamentally, that cannot be the right test.

Now, right out of the box, equal protection is

7
Alderson Reporting Company

At a

Official

1

minimum, that part of Seattle has to go because if you

2

had a race­neutral law, like Michigan's Equal Protection

3

Clause, which forbids discrimination on the basis of

4

race or sex ­­ you know, it mirrors the concept of the

5

Federal clause ­­ that itself would be subject to strict

6

scrutiny because it has a racial focus.

7

can't be right and that's Respondent's position.

8

So that leaves you two other choices.

9

So we know that

And

one would be an incremental change to this political

10

restructuring doctrine; the other would be a more

11

aggressive change.

12

interpret racial classification in Seattle as meaning a

13

law that, one, repeals an antidiscrimination provision,

14

as it did in Hunter and Seattle.

15

issue to a higher level of the decision­making process.

16

The incremental change would be to

And two, removes that

And because Michigan's law requires equal

17

treatment, it eliminates preferences, not an

18

antidiscrimination law.

19

could keep Seattle and Hunter as a viable doctrine, and

20

still rule in our favor on this case.

21

That would be a way that you

5

Affirmative action has the same

We've said that in Fisher, it should be to

MR. BURSCH:

Right.

But there's a

6

difference between favoring diversity as an abstract

7

concept on campus, which Grutter clearly allows, and

8

remedying past discrimination, which was the point of

9

the bussing in Seattle.

10
11
12
13

And that's why we're really in

a post­Seattle world now because under ­­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there ­­ there was no

proof that there was any de jure segregation in Seattle.
MR. BURSCH:

That's correct because, at the

14

time of Seattle's decision, we didn't yet have parents

15

involved, and so there wasn't a strict scrutiny test

16

that was being applied to that bussing program.

17

you didn't have to go as far as you would today if you

18

wanted to uphold that same bussing program.

And so

19

But what really ­­ what ties this case up ­­

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21

there are three things.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And was there a third, did

you say?

11

MR. BURSCH:

Well, the third way is really

12

to ­­ to look at racial focus and say that's wrong, and

13

maybe this whole doctrine needs to be reexamined.

14

the way that you could do that is to look at what

15

Seattle and Hunter are really doing, which is falling

16

right into the Washington v. Davis line of cases.

17

And

Both of those cases could have been resolved

18

by saying, one, there's a disparate impact; and two,

19

given the facts and circumstances in 1969, Akron, Ohio

20

and 1982, Seattle, Washington, that there was

21

discriminatory animus based on race.

22

that, you could reconcile those cases with

23

Washington v. Davis and the entire line of equal

24

protection jurisprudence this Court has used since that

25

time.

10

But the reason to claim

in this case, it just wasn't decided ­­ wasn't there a

3

racial animus, that the reason for Proposition 2 was to

4

reduce the minority population?

5

didn't get to that, but there was such a claim.

6

MR. BURSCH:

The court of appeals

This is

reasons, including the belief of some in Michigan that

that ­­ race­neutral alternatives is actually a better

MR. BURSCH:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.
But not necessarily a

distinction in Seattle because Seattle you could argue,

4

well, there are other methods that are less racially

5

divisive.

6

MR. BURSCH:

And I think ­­ and I would like

7

to come back to Reitman because that fits into this

8

framework, too.

9

But I think if you have any question about

10

what Seattle really meant, the place to look is the

11

later decision in Cuyahoga Falls because in Cuyahoga the

12

Court specifically mentions, quote, "the evil of

13

discriminatory intent present in Seattle."

14

pages 196 to '97 of the opinion.

That's at

15

And it also talks about the decisionmakers'

statements as evidence of discriminatory intent in the

17

Hunter case, at page 195.

18

Cuyahoga Falls, it has already done some of the work for

19

you if you are going to take the more conservative route

20

and say there's intent.

21

And so I think if you look at

MR. BURSCH:

That's true and there is always

4

some bad apples, too.

5

­­ but here you have a district court holding that there

6

is not even a material question of fact with respect to

animus, because there are so many reasons that could be

8

advanced, legitimate reasons again, about mismatch and

9

about the benefits of racial ­­

12

We don't dispute that point.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In Seattle as well.

But

it wasn't the issue of animus that drove Seattle.
MR. BURSCH:

I think it's much harder in

13

Seattle, Your Honor.

14

this discussion and what I would consider the more

15

conservative way to deal with Seattle and Hunter, one

16

that would preserve those as a doctrine, is to think

17

about how Reitman would come out under that test.

18

So

But, you know, to fit Reitman into

In Reitman, of course, you had

19

antidiscrimination laws, just like in Hunter, at the

20

local level, which were then repealed by a State

21

constitutional amendment.

22

restructuring doctrine had not yet been invented yet,

23

and so what the Court did is it relied on the California

24

Supreme Court's finding that there was discriminatory

25

animus in striking down those antidiscrimination laws.

And the political

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I think that if you view Hunter and Seattle

2

similarly as cases where if you repeal an

3

antidiscrimination law, as opposed to one that requires

4

equal treatment, that's the narrow way to cabin those

5

cases and ones that ­­ a way that would allow those

6

cases to survive, yet to distinguish Section 26.

7

One point that we haven't discussed much is

8

the democratic process, and it's important that I

9

emphasize that, obviously, the use of race­based and

10

sex­based preferences in college education is certainly

11

one of the most hotly contested issues of our time.

12

some believe that those preferences are necessary for

13

campus diversity.

14

necessary, and in fact that we would have a much better

15

world if we moved past the discussion about race and

16

instead based it on race­neutral criteria.

Others think that they are not

Michigan, on the enrollment of minorities in the

23

that, what effect the repeal of affirmative action has

24

had?

25

MR. BURSCH:

The question, what

Do we have any clear picture of

Alderson Reporting Company

2

first thing that we have is the actual statistics for

3

the first full year after Section 26 went into effect.

4

This is 2008.

5

As we explain in our reply brief, the

And what we find is that the number of

6

underrepresented minorities as part of the entering

7

freshman class at Michigan as a percentage changed very

8

little.

9

10­1/4 percent.

10

It went from about 10­3/4 percent to about

Then it gets very difficult to track,

11

because, following the U.S. Census's lead, in 2010 the

12

University of Michigan stopped requiring students to

13

check only a single box to demonstrate what their race

14

or ethnicity was and moved to a multiple checkbox

15

system.

16

And Justice Sotomayor, when you see in the

17

amici briefs that there has been a dramatic drop, for

18

example, in African American students on campus at the

19

University of Michigan, those numbers don't take into

20

account that people who before were forced to check a

21

single box now could be checking multiple boxes.

22

you fold in the multiple checkbox students, the number

23

of underrepresented minorities on campus actually comes

24

out higher.

25

because you could have a student who might be white and

And if

Now, we don't know what those numbers are

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Asian and they would not be considered an

2

underrepresented minority, and they could be in there.

3

But we know that the numbers are a lot closer than when

4

you just look at single checkbox students in isolation.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what do we do with

6

the statistics from California?

7

California, their attorney general, has shown, another

8

State with a similar proposition, has shown the dramatic

9

drop.

10

MR. BURSCH:

An amici from

Well, the statistics in

11

California across the 17 campuses in the University of

12

California system show that today the underrepresented

13

minority percentage is better on 16 out of those 17

14

campuses.

15

there yet, but it's better on the rest.

16

It's not at Berkeley, they haven't gotten

And by going to race­neutral criteria, what

17

they discovered was that underrepresented minority

18

students have higher GPAs, that they take more

19

technology, engineering, and math classes, and they have

20

a graduation rate that is 20 to 25 percent higher than

21

it was before California's Proposition 209.

22

You can see similar effects in Texas in

23

their top 10 percent program before it was modified.

24

And not only did it have those positive impacts, but it

25

actually increased minority performance at

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

social­economically disadvantaged high schools, where

2

the students said, hey, if I can only get into the top

3

10 percent of my class, I can be in the University of

4

Texas at Austin.

5

And again, we can all agree that diversity

6

on campus is a goal that should be pursued.

7

California and Texas experiences have demonstrated is

8

that there are good, positive reasons why the voters

9

might want to try a race­neutral alternative.

3

or Section 26 that single out race, it's the Equal

4

Protection Clause itself.

5

if a student wants to lobby for an alumni preference or

6

a cello preference and put it in the State constitution,

7

strict scrutiny is never applied to that effort.

constitution, strict scrutiny is always applied.

11

And so it's the Equal Protection Clause

12

which is making a differentiation between race and

13

everything else.

14

again decided the same day as Seattle, at page 538,

15

recognized, quote, "a distinction between State action

16

that discriminates on the basis of race and State action

17

that addresses in neutral fashion race­related matters."

18

And Section 26 falls into that latter category.

19

And that's why this Court in Crawford,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You have been asked

20

several questions that refer to the ending or

21

termination of affirmative action.

22

at issue here, is it?

23

MR. BURSCH:

That's not what is

No, and I'm glad that you

24

brought that up, Chief Justice Roberts, because

25

affirmative action means a lot more than simply the use

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of race or sex­based preferences in university

2

admissions.

3

The ­­ Article I, Section 26, only focuses

4

on this one aspect of university admissions.

5

another important point to understand is that Section 26

6

is not all about university admissions.

7

actually a much broader law that applies not just to

8

race and ethnicity, but also to sex and other factors,

MR. BURSCH:

Well, under what we're going to

call the narrow "Save Hunter and Seattle," something

2

like that would be unconstitutional because it removes

3

an antidiscrimination provision and moves it to a higher

4

level of government.

5

Now, one of the problems with keeping that

6

doctrine is it could also work the opposite way.

7

know, pretend that the political climate in Michigan was

8

turned on its head and that universities had agreed that

9

they were no longer going to use race or sex in

You

10

admissions and that it was the State electorate, either

11

in the legislature or in the constitution, which imposed

12

a Grutter plan on everyone.

13

Well, under Hunter and Seattle, that would

14

have to go because that law removes an

15

antidiscrimination provision and moves it to the higher

16

level.

17

want to take the Washington v. Davis approach and

18

consider whether there's discriminatory animus based on

race.

And so that would be one reason why you might

20

But, you know, in either of those cases, I

21

think you can either, you know, pare down the doctrine

22

or get rid of it entirely and distinguish our case from

23

it.

24

today is that the ­­ the core of Respondent's arguments

25

that somehow a racial classification can be any law that

1

has a racial focus, cannot be the right test.

2

what, that portion of Seattle and Hunter has to go.

3

Because equal protection is about protecting

4

individuals, not about protecting laws, and even

5

nondiscriminatory race­neutral laws that have a racial

6

focus would fall under their racial focus test.

7

You know, the hypothetical we give in our

No matter

8

briefs on that, besides a State Equal Protection Clause,

9

would be the Federal Fair Housing Act because it

10

references race, it has a racial focus, in the words of

11

Seattle and Hunter, and it has the ability of preventing

12

anyone from lobbying for preferences based on their race

13

or sex at lower levels of the government, either State

14

or local.

15

So under their theory, the Federal Fair

16

Housing Act would have to be applied under strict

17

scrutiny.

18

is that, well, the Supremacy Clause takes care of that

19

problem.

20

until you first determine that the Federal law itself is

21

constitutional, and it wouldn't be under their theory.

22

And their only response to that in the brief

And we all know supremacy doesn't kick in

So ­­ so what we're asking you to do is

23

eliminate that portion of Hunter and Seattle that

24

suggests that a law's racial focus is the sine qua non

25

of a political restructuring doctrine test and to

that was taken in Seattle derived from a different view

of the Equal Protection Clause?

7

hostile disadvantageous legislation.

I mean, strict scrutiny

And so the view

10

then was we use strict scrutiny when the majority is

disadvantaging the minority.

ask, is the minority being disadvantaged?

So you do, under the

If that were the view, then I suppose we

that it is ­­ measures a disadvantage the ­­ the

So if we were faithful to that notion,

22

MR. BURSCH:

23

Justice Ginsburg.

24

crystal clear that a Grutter plan is not about which

25

minority group is being advantaged or disadvantaged.

Well, two thoughts on that,
First, under Grutter, this Court made

1

It's supposed to benefit the campus as a whole.

2

the extent the claim is that preferences benefit certain

3

classes of minorities and not others, you know, for

example, it benefits African Americans and Latinos, but

5

not Asians, even though they're both discrete and

6

insular underrepresented groups, that ­­ then it fails

under Grutter.

8

everybody.

9

And to

It can only be something that benefits

But more fundamentally, going back to your

10

question about the origin of the doctrine, I think it's

11

really important to understand why we have Hunter

12

because Hunter, remember, was decided before

13

Washington v. Davis.

14

the law in Akron, Ohio in Hunter, there's nothing in

15

there that would trigger strict scrutiny.

16

Court was searching for another way to ­­ to strike down

17

a law that removed an antidiscrimination provision and

18

made it more difficult to reenact at the higher level of

19

the political process.

20

And when you look at the face of

And so this

It needed something to fix that.

And our point is you can either construe it

21

to do exactly that, that only antidiscrimination laws

22

being struck down and moved to a higher level can

23

satisfy a political restructuring doctrine, or you can

24

look at it differently.

25

Washington v. Davis and we all know what the intent was

You can say, Now that we've got

in Akron, that that is a simpler way to address this ­­

2

this problem and we really don't need the political

restructuring doctrine at all anymore.

But the reason why we had the doctrine in
Hunter is because strict scrutiny did not apply.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is that an accurate

description of Seattle?

18

before the school board adopted the bussing plan, the

19

city was threatened with lawsuits by the Department of

to at least one of the districts, Justice Alito.

MR. BURSCH:

But Justice Sotomayor, the

21

biggest problem with Respondents' test, with applying

22

the literal language of Seattle, is that as I said, the
