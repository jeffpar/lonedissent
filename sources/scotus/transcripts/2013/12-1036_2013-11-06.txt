ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. MASSEY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MASSEY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The text and structure of the Class Action

12

Fairness Act of 2005, which is known as CAFA, show that

13

it does not extend to State parens patriae actions.

14

there are any doubt on the matter, CAFA would have to be

15

narrowly construed as a matter of the principles of

16

federalism that are at issue here, as evidenced by the

17

46 States supporting Mississippi before the Court.

18

If

The disposition of the case today, we

19

believe, is straightforward.

20

plaintiff in this case, the State of Mississippi.

21

not a citizen for purposes of diversity jurisdiction,

22

and therefore, the requirements of even minimal

23

diversity, let alone the 100­person numerosity

24

requirement of CAFA, cannot be met.

25

There is only one

Our friends on the other side want to use

the statute of CAFA to change that result.

3

today.

4

The mass

It is in the Joint Appendix at pages 79 to 80.

Essentially, the attempt to force State

5

actions into the mass action definition is a

9

plaintiffs or more in a case.

10
11

The mass action

And CAFA provides that

there's Federal jurisdiction over such a case.
But that does not apply to this situation.

to be tried jointly.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Massey, with respect

17

to that, there is a claim for restitution.

18

if the suit is successful, the money that's collected

19

will be distributed to all the people who are affected

20

by this conduct.

21

MR. MASSEY:

I take it,

Well, Justice Ginsburg, that's

22

very unlikely in this case.

23

Plaintiff in this case is the State of Mississippi.

24

consumers of Mississippi have already sued in an

25

indirect purchaser action that has been settled.

The Plaintiffs ­­ the

Briefs, 65(a) describes the restitution claim.

6

Your Honor is correct.

And at page 65(a) of

The restitution claim seeks recovery to the

7

State of the money, not to consumers in Mississippi.

8

And what's likely to happen here ­­ and, frankly, what

9

happens very frequently when the Federal Trade

10

Commission or the Securities and Exchange Commission or

11

any other State or agency seeks restitution, the money

12

is recovered by the State.

13

And in a case like this, where it is very

14

difficult to trace the individuals, the consumers who've

15

been hurt ­­ after all, we're talking an LCD

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Let's assume a case

where ­­ forget about that the consumer action was

10

And let's forget about a case in which the

damages are difficult to prove.

11

MR. MASSEY:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.
Let's think of a case in

13

which the damages can be determined, and the State comes

14

in on behalf of a class of consumers and says, we're

15

seeking their restitution.

16

the facts are different?

17

MR. MASSEY:

Does your argument change if

Our argument does not change.

18

I would say, in our case, the State ­­ just to be clear

19

about restitution ­­ the State is proceeding under

20

statutes that gives the ­­ the State the only cause of

21

action.

JUSTICE ALITO:

What do you do with

reference to persons?
MR. MASSEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

There is a

6

reference to persons in the mass action definition.

7

occurs ­­ we believe, very strongly, that it

8

equates ­­ that ­­ that section continues and equates

9

persons with plaintiffs, and that the statute, in fact,

It

10

wouldn't ­­ would be absurd if it didn't because it

11

refers to the monetary claims of 100 or more persons, as

12

Your Honor has noted.

13

But then it says, "that are proposed to be

14

tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs' claims

15

involve common questions of law or fact."

16

sets have to mean the same thing; otherwise, it doesn't

17

make any sense.

Those two

Well, because ­­ we think that

common question test, not to the persons who were in the

13

case, those abstract unnamed, unknown consumers, you're

14

not inquiring as to what their claims might be, you're

What if you have an

executor, and he's administering an estate in which 100

12

people have equal shares to the estate, and the estate

13

has a claim.

14

Now, is that covered as a mass action or ­­ or not?

15

And he brings it on behalf of the estate.

MR. MASSEY:

That, of course, is a different

16

case when it is not involving the government.

17

think Navarro would, essentially, address that

18

situation.

19

But we

That's this Court's decision in 1980 that

20

held that the trustees of a business trust were the sole

21

real parties in interest and that the beneficiaries were

22

not, even though they stood to get money as a result of

23

the action, so I think that would address Your Honor's

24

question.

25

The text of the statute still would refer to

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

"plaintiff."

2

whether under State law ­­ this is what happened in

3

Navarro ­­ the Court inquired, does the executor have

4

the legal authority to represent the beneficiaries as

the sole plaintiff?

seek restitution.

It's actually on

In that case, the Washington Supreme Court

19

encountered the situation where the State had sought

20

restitution on behalf of consumers and sought to

21

distribute the money to consumers, and consumers also

22

brought separate damages actions.

23

And the Washington court said, there was no

24

double recovery, no preclusion problem, because the

25

restitution remedies were public in nature, and the

12

1

private damages actions proceeded under different

statutory authority for different claims.

3

And whether Mississippi would adopt that

approach, I don't know.

there is a longstanding tradition of restitution being a

public remedy.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER M. CURRAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. CURRAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

18

The attorney general's interpretation of the

19

mass action definition requires this Court to conclude

20

that a mass action can only be one of the actions with

21

100 or more named plaintiffs and can never be a

22

representative action.

Act, and the structure of the Act.

2

class, that could be persons, and you could identify

3

those.

4

5

claims above or below $75,000?

6

But under your theory, what does a court do to

MR. CURRAN:

Well ­­ well, a couple of

7

things.

9

our position is that is unnamed.

Number one, it ­­ it may well be that the mass

The reference to plaintiffs

14

Ginsburg referred to this ­­ this as well, that ­­ that

15

can make perfect sense.

16

that the named plaintiffs, who, after all, are being

17

given the keys to Federal discovery and maybe the

18

ability to negotiate settlements, that they've got some

19

skin in the game, that the plaintiffs, the named

20

plaintiffs controlling the litigation, have 75,000 or

21

more at stake.

It's ­­ it's a way to make sure

18

19

suggestion that this is unwieldy or does it make sense,

20

if all the claimants under 75,000 get remanded.

21

And this is an

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It seems that that would

4

be hard to invoke that case when a statute commands

5

differently.

6

MR. CURRAN:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I mean, I don't see ­­
In that case, it's in

8

the ­­ in the absence of statutory language that

9

requires remand.

10

MR. CURRAN:

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well ­­
I ­­ I'm hard­pressed to

12

think that we can be exercising supplemental

13

jurisdiction in a case where Congress has expressly

14

spoken and said you can't or shouldn't.

15

MR. CURRAN:

Well, I don't understand that

16

because Section 1367 says supplemental jurisdiction

17

shall exist, unless it's expressly provided otherwise in

18

a Federal statute.

19

And this Court, interpreting similar

20

language in the Breuer case, which is cited in the

21

papers, said "expressly" means it's got to be direct,

22

it's got to be explicit, it has to be inescapable.

23

So I would submit that this language about

24

the 75,000, that does not preclude supplemental

25

jurisdiction.

In fact, I think that ­­ that argument is

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

2

foreclosed by Breuer.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In this particular case,

3

the individual claims were settled in the ­­ in the

4

class action, so if there ­­ if there are no individual

5

claimants to be ­­ to be represented, why doesn't this

6

end up being a claim where only the State of Mississippi

7

has a stake because the individuals that the State might

8

have been representing have already been satisfied, so

9

if this is ­­

10

MR. CURRAN:

There are ­­ there are a couple

11

of aspects to this.

12

course, is that the Mississippi statute requires that

13

the money goes to the Mississippi citizens and that the

14

attorney general here is basically suing as a

15

representative or a conduit for those citizens.

First of all, our position, of

16

The fact that those citizens, many of those

17

citizens, not all of them, the fact that many of them

18

have settled and have resolved the claims in the

19

multidistrict litigation, that means that there is going

20

to be a fight in one court or another ­­ we think it

21

should be in a Federal court; the attorney general

22

thinks the State court ­­ over what the preclusive

23

effects are of that prior settlement.

that there are perhaps all kinds of State actions where

you say hurt your citizens, do you mean hurt them by

MR. CURRAN:

MR. CURRAN:

Okay.

But to be clear, our ­­

15

in our position, the only basis we have for removal here

is the inclusion of the restitution claim, which, under

Mississippi law, says that the claim belongs to the

We don't care where it goes.
But can we not take him at

He said it wasn't.

MR. CURRAN:

Well, the Mississippi statute

is clear.

law is clear on that.

12

that Mississippi law required the money to go to the

individuals.

loose label that's thrown around.

18

that issues of federalism prevents removal or something.

21

That doesn't hold up.

cases that can be brought by State attorney generals

the restitution claim.

6

Okay?

Also, if there's a big pollution problem

that, where ­­ where there's no identifiable victims,

about this ­­ this language in the definition?

MR. CURRAN:

claims in a single lawsuit is the inescapable

commonality of fact and maybe law in those claims.

I ­­ I do think that it ­­ it satisfies that language.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So

Well, Mr. Curran, really, do

11

you ­­ are you saying that, as a matter of State law,

12

that, in this suit, the attorney general has to make a

13

proposal that ­­ that the plaintiff ­­ that ­­ that he

14

can bring the suit on the grounds that the plaintiffs'

15

claims involve common questions of law or fact and that

16

that proposal has to be adjudicated by the Court?

17

MR. CURRAN:

I think, Justice Kagan, that

18

the attorney general has already done that.

19

that his complaint, beginning on the first page, says,

20

I'm bringing this claim on behalf of purchases by the

21

State and by its citizens of these LCD panels, and it's

22

a single complaint.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think

So I think ­­ I think ­­
But he does not have to show

24

any common questions of law or fact in the typical way

25

that we demand.

I mean, that's actually a really

41
Alderson Reporting Company

demanding showing that we have forced lawyers to make in

3

has to do is to stand up and say, I have a State

interest in protecting my citizens and in deterring

5

improper behavior, and here is my substantive right.

6

MR. CURRAN:

All that the attorney general

Well, I guess ­­ I suppose we

7

could move for bifurcation to separate the ­­ the

8

proprietary claims from the claims on behalf of

9

citizens, and then he would say, no, it makes sense to

10

keep them all together.

11

sequencing of those arguments, I don't think should be

12

dispositive here.

13
14
15

But ­­ but the ­­ the

By filing a complaint, again, I invoke

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess I don't understand

20

It seems to me that what the

8

result?

9

MR. CURRAN:

Both.

What

Well, certainly, it's ­­ it's a

10

mass action in that circumstance because restitution,

11

under Mississippi law, is for those specified

12

individuals.

13
14
15
16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, the rest of my

hypothetical, part of the restitution goes to the State.
MR. CURRAN:

Well, then, again, the

statutory language says if it's a civil action ­­

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18

MR. CURRAN:

Where's the language?
Well, it's at the beginning of

19

the mass action definition.

20

either 65(a) and 66(a) or 79(a).

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

22

MR. CURRAN:

You can look at it on

I have 79.
Okay.

79(a), "Mass action

23

means any civil action in which monetary relief claims of

24

25

qualifying claim, then the civil action's removable.

So as long as you've got a

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And it doesn't matter if there are additional claims or

2

extraneous claims.

3

So the ­­ the claim here for restitution on

4

behalf of Mississippi citizens is, in and of itself,

5

enough to make this a mass action.

6

And, again ­­ and, Justice Kagan, maybe this

7

is getting back to ­­ to your point.

8

references to representative actions in the ­­ in the

9

General Public Provision and in the 1407 provision that

I refer to the

10

inescapably mean that ­­ that this provision can apply

11

to representative actions.

12

Maybe that doesn't satisfy your commonality

13

point, but ­­ but it gets part of the way there.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And this is the main

15

provision where they're trying to define what mass

16

action means.

17

there's some slippage between this provision and the

18

various provisions that it refers back to because those

19

provisions ­­ we're talking about class actions, and

20

this one is talking about mass actions.

21

And I take your point that there are ­­

But this is the essential definition.

And

22

this one seems to be pointing to a very different kind

23

of suit, one in which there are 100 individual claims

24

that ­­ that 100 people seek to have joined in which a

25

court is going to make a determination about whether

44
Alderson Reporting Company

1

those 100 individual claims have questions of common law

or fact.

3

MR. CURRAN:

If that's all this statute was

4

meant to reach, that would have been such an easy

5

statute to write.

language, it could have just said if it's a civil action

7

monetary relief claims for joint ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that would have

required this Court ­­

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's essentially what it

12

says.

13

in what you just said is that it says persons, instead

14

of named plaintiffs.

15

sentence, it's pretty clear that persons and plaintiffs

16

are the same.

17

I mean, the only ­­ the only thing it doesn't say

MR. CURRAN:

But then, if you read the

Well, how ­­ well, first of

18

all, how do you explain ­­ I don't mean to pose a

19

question to you ­­ it's inexplicable that the word

20

"persons" ­­

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

22

(Laughter.)

23

MR. CURRAN:

I might not answer it.

It's ­­ it's inexplicable that

24

Congress would use the word "persons" and then, 12 words

25

later, use "plaintiffs," if it signifies the exact same

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

thing and then continue to use the term "plaintiffs"

2

throughout.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But

isn’t your

4

proposal mean that before someone can remove, they have

5

to decide whether the class is certifiable?

6

MR. CURRAN:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No.
Because you're not going

8

to decide whether these plaintiffs are actually going to

9

be plaintiffs and part of this class until you decide

10

the class question.

11

you use the language of the statute, it's the class

12

that's being proposed.

13

the class that's being proposed of persons that are

14

being proposed to be tried together.

15

If you use the word "persons" and

MR. CURRAN:

It's the named plaintiffs and

There's another provision in

16

here that is incorporated into the mass action ­­ you

17

know, you will recall that if something qualifies as a

18

mass action then the provisions dealing with class

19

actions apply as well.

20

at the bottom of 77a, specifically says, "This

21

subsection shall apply to any class action before or

22

after the entry of a class certification order by the

23

court with respect to that action."

24
25

And sub­part 8, which is found

So it's ­­ what this statute is addressing
is possible class actions.

And, in fact, I think ­­ I

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

think it makes sense to ­­ to view this ­­ this

2

statutory question in light of the overriding statutory

3

purpose here.

4

And, Justice Breyer, you address this in

5

your opinion in Standard Fire.

6

this statute was to put interstate claims of national

7

importance into Federal court, to provide the option of

8

a Federal forum.

9

this Court unanimously examined the statutory question

10

The driving force behind

And in that case, in Standard Fire,

there through that lens.

11

Here ­­ so Congress dealt with class actions

12

proper, if you will, under Rule 23, in the class action

13

section.

14

which is inescapably designed to catch other devices

15

that have the same problems.

16

And then it's got the mass action section,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

do it right, you know?

18

(Laughter.)

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Sometimes, Congress doesn't

Sometimes, they try to

20

catch everything, but the language they use doesn't do

21

it.

22
23

MR. CURRAN:

But, here, I think it does do

it.

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

MR. CURRAN:

But more than that ­­
And if there are competing

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

interpretations, then that purpose should drive the

2

decision.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But more than that,

4

Mr. Curran, is that there was actually a considered

5

effort by the attorneys generals here to take themselves

6

out of this statute ­­

7

MR. CURRAN:

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

And they failed.
­­ and that that ­­ well,

you say they failed, and ­­ I mean, that's the statutory

10

question.

But it's not just Congress didn't do it right

11

this time.

It was that there was a very serious effort

12

to get attorneys general out of this statute.

13

that's ­­ and ­­ you know, it seems to me that they did

14

pretty well.

15

MR. CURRAN:

No, no, no, no.

No.

And

They made

16

their proposal to ­­ to modify the statute after the Act

17

was in this form.

18

including Attorney General Hood sent a letter to

19

Congress saying this is going to infringe upon our

20

rights to parens patriae cases.

21

sponsored by Senator Pryor failed.

22

They saw the Act in this form ­­ and

That amendment

So I ­­ I think the only conclusion that can

23

be drawn from that is that Attorney General Hood and

24

many of his counterparts in other States saw this

25

problem, saw this ­­ this threat.

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Now, a response that some on the Senate

2

floor gave to that proposal was it's not really

3

necessary.

4

is because the bona fide interests of the State were

5

already protected, through the local controversy rule

6

and through the general public exception.

7

But the reason it was not really necessary

Congress did not intend for State attorneys

8

general to be able to use their offices to hire outside

counsel ­­ out­of­State outside counsel, to copycat a

10

class action complaint from an MDL, bring it again ­­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Maybe ­­

maybe they

13

the definition of mass action?

14

new subsection D­11, "expands the jurisdiction over suits

15

that are brought on behalf of numerous" ­­ numerous ­­

16

"named plaintiffs."

17

MR. CURRAN:

And it is, under this

"Numerous named plaintiffs."
Yes, I am familiar with that

18

sentence in that Senate report.

19

that Senate report was issued and dated a week or ten

20

days after Senate ­­ after President Bush signed this

21

Act, so I question its value and its credibility.

22
23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I am also aware that

You mean it's contrived

legislative history? I can’t imagine.

24

(Laughter.)

25

MR. CURRAN:

But ­­ but even if it somehow

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

could be considered, I don't think that ­­ that sentence

2

is definitional.

3

to ­­ to conventional class actions that Congress was

4

concerned about.

5

That, certainly, is one alternative

Our point is it wasn't the only one.

6

Congress was trying to close loopholes and trying to

7

prevent abuses, and a miserly interpretation of the

8

class ­­ of the mass action definition would undermine

9

that ­­ that purpose.

10

Now, in my remaining time perhaps, not ­­

11

Justice Kagan, at the end of the day there was no

12

carve­out in the statute for attorney general actions,

13

even though that was sought.

14

15

But the Act does reflect

18

notification to State attorneys general when there's a

19

settlement of a class action.

20

There is also a

Those kinds of provisions show that Congress

21

was trying to be sensitive, and it was horse trading, it

22

was cutting deals, it was log rolling, coming up with an

23

Act here that was at once sensitive to federalism

24

concerns, but also trying to solve the very real abuses

25

that it had identified.

50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And on the federalism point, the attorney

2

general's brief has a lot of citations to Eleventh

3

Amendment issues, and some of this Court's precedents

4

dealing with State sovereign immunity.

5

those precedents and that Amendment deal only with

6

situations where the State is a defendant.

7

I submit that

And here, where we are talking about the

8

State as a plaintiff ­­ and the only intrusion we are

9

talking about is removal from State court to Federal

10

court, that is not on the same playing field as the

11

authorities relied on by the attorney general.

12

A couple of other things.

There was a

13

suggestion in the reply brief that the complaint here

14

was not, in fact, a copycat case ­­ a copycat complaint,

15

but instead, was a summary of the Federal indictments,

16

and that that explains the eerie similarity between the

17

class action complaint and the attorney general's

18

complaint.

19

That ­­ that's just factually not right.

The ­­ some companies who were defendants,

20

like my client, Toshiba, was never charged or convicted

21

of anything in this case, yet we're a defendant in this

22

case, and that's because we were a defendant in the

23

class action case that was copied.

24
25

And, in fact, the indictments against some
companies bear very little resemblance to the complaint

The issues that I'd like to raise on

is that jurisdictional schemes should be simple,

administrable, predictable.

19

The ­­ the most important thing

The simplest route ­­ the simplest

20

interpretation is the one we have shown, that these ­­

21

the statute is directed at actual plaintiffs with

22

concrete claims that are proposed to be tried jointly.

23

The only thing our friends on the other side

24

have pointed out is the use of the ­­ is the word

25

Justice Sotomayor is 100 percent correct

52
Alderson Reporting Company

1

that the word "persons" is basically ­­ is an echo of

2

Rule 20, of the joinder rule, which also refers to

3

persons and plaintiffs.

4

So the fact that Congress used the word

5

"person" once in a mass action definition simply

6

confirms our point that the statute is really directed

7

at the mass joinder, mass consolidation situation, and

8

does not have anything to do with actions by sovereign

9

States.

10

8

Mississippi in 2006, the only really relevant authority.

9

It's called the BASF case.

And there, a lower court in

10

Mississippi, the Chancery Court, upheld the attorney

11

general's authority to bring a very similar parens

12

patriae case.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

What he says is ­­ in the

14

complaint, it says ­­ "prays that the defendant be

15

ordered to restitute any and all monies for the

16

purchases of its citizens."

17

All right.

Now, you look at the statute he

18

quoted, the Mississippi statute, and it says there is

19

the authority to have restitution to restore to any

20

person in interest any monies which may have been

21

acquired by means of a practice prohibited.

22

So he says that sounds as if what you're

23

talking about is you want restitution, though, given to

24

the State, the restitution is for individual purchases

25

of individual citizens because there could be no other.

And, therefore, you have a list of people in mind, or

2

you must find one, where there were particular

3

individual purchases, by individual citizens, and get

4

that restitution into the treasury.

5

All right.

Now, that ­­ I think something

6

like that was his argument, and I wanted to know what

7

you were going to say.

8

last five words, "and the purchases of its citizens"?

9
10
11

Are you going to give up these

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's what I

understood the Fifth Circuit to have held.
MR. MASSEY:

Well, what the ­­ what the ­­

12

what the prayer for relief says is the ­­ "restitute to

13

the State" ­­

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. MASSEY:

­­ "for its purchases and the

purchases of its citizens."
JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, and the purchases of

its citizens.
MR. MASSEY:

So the State will get the

money ­­
JUSTICE BREYER:

I know they'll get the

money ­­

23

MR. MASSEY:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Right.

Right.
­­ but he's saying, to get

the money, you have to say which money.

MR. MASSEY:

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, it ­­
And to get the money, which

3

money means you better have a list of the individual

4

people who bought something, or otherwise, there is no

5

such money.

6

And that's enough to make those, in respect

7

to this paragraph, individual people whose claims the

8

State of Mississippi is pursuing.

9

is his argument.

10
11

Something like that

And I just wanted to know your

response.
MR. MASSEY:

Well, the ­­ the evidence will

12

be proven through statistical aggregate evidence, rather

13

than a list of names.

14

The ­­ the State will show, basically, on the basis of

15

gross sales ­­

The list of names is impractical.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

the facts of this case.

18

with the ­­ with the ­­ the point, which is that you ­­

19

in ­­ in a normal case, aren't you, in fact, suing for

20

the citizens?

21

But that has to go with
Don't go with the facts.

The named citizens.

MR. MASSEY:

Or the citizens ­­

In many cases, we are.

22

still a public remedy of restitution.

23

the individuals may be identified.

24

Thank you.
