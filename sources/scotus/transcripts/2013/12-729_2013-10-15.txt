ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW W.H. WESSLER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WESSLER:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the
Court:
This case involves an accrual provision in

13

an ERISA plan that starts the clock running on a Federal

14

denial of benefits claim near the beginning of ERISA's

15

mandatory internal claims process before the Federal

16

claim ever exists or could be filed in court.

17

This provision directly conflicts with

18

ERISA's two­tiered remedial structure, which is designed

19

to maximize the number of claims that are resolved

20

internally without lawyers in courts.

21

provision undermines this goal by making it impossible

22

for anyone to know in advance how much time will be left

23

on the limitations clock after the internal process is

24

complete.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The Respondent's

How much time was left in

3
Alderson Reporting Company

this case?
MR. WESSLER:

There was approximately one

year, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And you ­­ and if there

5

were a one­year limitation running from the final

6

administrative review, you would be out?

7

MR. WESSLER:

Well, I don't think we would

8

be out in this case, Your Honor, because the provision

9

in this case was a three year from final denial.

Going

10

forward, if, in fact, ERISA plans had a one­year clock

11

running from final denial, everyone would know that they

12

would need to file their claim within one year from time

13

of final denial.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but if there were

15

such a rule, one year from the final administrative

16

decision, this claim would become too late.

17
18

MR. WESSLER:

If, in fact, the provision in

this plan ­­

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. WESSLER:

Yes.

Yes.

­­ said one year from final

denial, that's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What accounts for the

23

delay?

24

a year went by before this suit was instituted, why was

25

that ­­ why did that happen?

When the ­­ the clock was running and more than

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. WESSLER:

Well, I think this gets us,

2

Your Honor, to one of the core problems with this

3

provision, which is that it's confusing.

4

One of the key questions with these provisions, when

5

they're coupled with the mandatory exhaustion

6

requirement, that is ­­ that is actually quite uncertain

7

when proof of loss is due.

8
9

It is unclear.

And so below, one ­­ one of the key
questions, which actually still remains unresolved, is

10

when the clock actually started ticking.

11

there's a ­­ there's a more fundamental problem ­­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But I think

I'm sorry.

I thought

13

the court below said that that was irrelevant to the

14

resolution of this case, that even if they accepted your

15

date for when the proof of loss started, that you would

16

still lose.

17

MR. WESSLER:

In this case, Your Honor,

18

that's true; however, the problem with these proof of

19

loss dates coupled with this mandatory exhaustion

20

requirement is that it is unclear from the outset

21

when ­­ when the clock ­­ how much time after final

22

denial would be left when you're in the middle of the

23

process.

24
25

And on this question of proof of loss ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm a little confused

because it would be the same no matter what rule we

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4

instituted.
MR. WESSLER:

Well, I ­­ I don't think

that's right, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Meaning, you would never

5

know when the administrative ­­ you really never know

6

when the administration process is final, just like

7

you're arguing you don't know when the proof of loss

8

date is final.

9

loss, you know you got three years from at least the

10
11

But at least the advantage of proof of

beginning of the process.
MR. WESSLER:

Right, although I ­­ there's

12

actually quite a bit of disagreement among the lower

13

courts about how you measure proof of loss, when that

14

date actually triggers the limitations clock.

15

So for instance, in the Seventh Circuit, the

16

court has held that proof of loss starts the clock

17

ticking the first time proof of loss is due under the

18

plan, which is the first set of documents that a

19

claimant actually provides to her plan supporting her

20

claim for disability.

21

The plan, however, through this internal

22

process, can come back and ask for more documents, more

23

evidence supporting the disability.

24

then provides those additional documents, that could

25

conceivably reset the limitations clock under this proof

If you need more time,

you have a potential out.
MR. WESSLER:

Well, in fact, you don't have

13

necessarily three years from when proof of loss starts

14

because courts, as respondents themselves acknowledge,

15

are necessarily going to have to evaluate these ­­ these

16

provisions on a case­by­case basis.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So it's ­­

6

provide predictability, certainty, and efficiency in the

administration of benefits.

8
9

And so to have courts being placed in the
center of what should be a straightforward and

10

streamlined process undermines the way Congress intended

11

this benefits administration process to proceed.

this, where they're going to necessarily be policing the

14

enforceability of a ­­ of a limitations provision before

that the ­­ that ­­ that for these denial of benefit

11

length of the period.

18

When does the claim actually

When can you file it in court?

And ­­ and what ­­ what we have here is a

19

limitations provision that includes an accrual date that

20

starts the clock running, not just before when you can

21

file it in court, but before there's ever even been an

22

injury.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, ERISA doesn't have a

24

statute of limitations, it doesn't specifically set out

25

a statute of limitations for this type of claim.

9
Alderson Reporting Company

But it

Official

1

does have a savings clause that says it doesn't preempt

2

State laws that regulate insurance.

3

So what would happen in this situation?

4

Let's say that a State statute says essentially what the

5

plan at issue says.

6

incorrect denial of insurance benefits must be brought

7

within three years after the proof of loss.

8

It says that a claim for the

And now let's assume we agree with you, that

9

under ERISA, any statute of limitations for the denial

10

of benefits must begin not when the proof of loss must

11

be filed, but upon the denial of benefits.

12

Does it follow, then, that the rule that

13

you're advocating would mean that ERISA preempted the

14

State law that regulated insurance in the way that I

15

just specified?

16

MR. WESSLER:

I ­­ I would think it would,

because it ­­ because it would conflict with ERISA's

remedial structure.

case, we know that these State laws don't apply to

20

Respondent's provision.

clear in their opposition brief.

I would stress here that in this

They themselves have made that

22

Most State laws, however, actually include

23

language to the effect of that insurers can use these

24

kinds of proof of loss languages or something similar so

25

far as it's not any less favorable.

10
Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE ALITO:

I think your answer to

2

that question has to be yes; otherwise, the situation

3

would be a mess.

4

MR. WESSLER:

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes.

Yes.

But I ­­ but in ­­ in what

6

sense is the law that I hypothesize not a law that

7

regulates insurance?

8

ERISA's savings clause?

9

MR. WESSLER:

So why wouldn't it fall within

It might as a first step, Your

10

Honor, but I think it would be impliedly conflicted

11

because it conflicts with the Federal structure of

12

ERISA.

13

provisions, which is I think where this provision comes

14

from in Respondent's plan, is that these State law

15

insurance regimes do not require mandatory exhaustion of

16

any internal claims process.

17

And the key point about these State law

You ­­ your clock starts running at proof of

18

loss and so long as you wait a 60­day waiting period,

19

you can then file your claim in court regardless of

20

whether the insurer has actually acted on your claim.

21

That is not true here.

Claimants do not

22

have the ability to file their claims in court until

23

they have exhausted this mandatory process.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is there any evidence in

other circuits that have this same rule that ­­ that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

approach the Respondents advocate has caused

2

difficulties and disruption and unfairness?

3

MR. WESSLER:

Well, I think we have seen

4

courts struggling with a host of questions about how to

5

resolve the enforceability of these provisions.

6

an example, we know that courts are in the ­­ are having

7

now to be in the business of asking whether the parties'

8

conduct during this internal process has caused some

9

waiver or estoppel of the limitations provision.

10

As just

That kind of inquiry, an estoppel kind of

11

inquiry, is a fact­based inquiry about whether the

12

plan's conduct in the internal process was unduly

13

reasonable ­­

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But in this case, as

15

Justice Ginsburg indicated at the outset, there was a

16

period of, I think, just over a year, in which it was

17

very clear that the administrative process had ended and

18

nothing happened.

19

application of the rule in this case.

20

I don't see the unfairness in the

MR. WESSLER:

Yes, Your Honor, but I think

21

the core problem here isn't so much one of unfairness as

22

it is certainty and predictability of what employees'

23

and plans' rights are under an ERISA plan.

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but there is also

certainty and fairness in processing the claim, and when

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

evidence is lost, especially in cases where employees

2

who were key witnesses have likely departed, that's

3

another very important consideration.

4

MR. WESSLER:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

But

5

to be clear, there is nothing about Respondent's

6

provision that advances any of those goals any more than

7

running a limitations clock one year from final denial.

8

As this Court has said, the internal claims

all of the evidence that ­­

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Wessler, this just I

5

think follows up on Justice Kennedy's question, but have

6

you identified any cases in which this serves to prevent

7

somebody from bringing a suit?

8
9

MR. WESSLER:

We have not found any cases in

which a claimant has actually lost the right to file a

10

suit.

11

The problem is in what we do see, which is where there

12

are three or four or two or five months left after final

13

denial on the clock, and courts are now in the business

14

of having to evaluate, does that give enough time to the

15

claimant to do all the things that she needs to do to

16

file her claim?

17

The problem isn't so much in that possibility.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But it seems as though those

18

courts have been pretty liberal in saying, whenever it

19

is necessary, no, take a little bit more time.

20

seems just a little bit like a solution in search of a

21

problem.

22

MR. WESSLER:

So, this you know, it

I think in fact it's just the

23

opposite.

ex ante, no one knows where they will be at the end.

that this provision would incentivize more lawyers

I don't think there'd be more

11

In fact, most of these State laws, they ­­ they actually

12

require plans to provide substitute language that would

13

be at least as favorable to the insureds.

14

So, for instance, you could have a plan ­­ a

plan could easily remedy the problem we have here by

16

saying our limitations period runs from 3 years from

determination, whichever is ­­ is later.

7

But the problem with this framework is that it actually

sets the required exhaustion procedure under 1133 and

other, because a claimant who is going through

Subject to State insurance law, ERISA gives

preemption analysis that Justice Alito referred to, I

whether the State law purports to supplement or displace

time of the insured loss, let's say the time of the fire

And what you commonly see is a limitation

5

What subsequently must happen within that

6

12 months is that the claimant must present proof of

7

loss within the 12 months as the clock is ticking.

8

Sometimes they must await the insurer's decision.

Sometimes they simply have a waiting period.

And then

10

they have to file suit.

11

the scheme that this Court discussed at some length in

12

the Wolfe case.

13

And that was the ­­ that was

And what that model is about is ­­ I mean, I

14

think we're all very familiar with the kind of Federal

15

administrative scheme where there are several steps of

16

administrative review, followed by a judicial review

17

step, where Congress writes a limitation period that's

18

essentially a grant of time in which a claimant can

19

proceed from one step to the next.

20

But that's not the only model, and it's not

21

the model that characterizes the insurance practice.

22

With that model ­­ the way that often works is there is

23

a deadline out there in the future, and by that deadline

24

a claimant must complete the pre­litigation steps

25

necessary and file their claim.

That's the type of

38
Alderson Reporting Company

model that this court also considered in enforcing the

one model versus the other is the only way a limitation

period can ever be written.

MS. CARROLL:

I ­­ I think that it's a

broader point, however, in terms of the uncertainty that

this would raise.

9

should be excised from ERISA plans in all plans where it

10

appears, for all cases because of speculation about what

11

might happen in some cases but does not usually happen,

12

to say that that can be a basis, absent any other anchor

13

in the statute, for judicially rewriting or ignoring

14

plan terms, would be a tectonic shift in the law of

15

ERISA in terms of Congress's goal of making sure that

16

plans would be enforced as written, particularly in a

cause of action under Section (a)(1)(B), which is a suit

agree to ­­ not to assert any defense based on the

I think, you know, as far as the DOL's

I mean, I think that probably avoids the

20

regulatory authority more generally, I think there is

21

also the looming question about whether the Department

22

has statutory authority to adopt a regulation that would

23

have the effect of preempting State law.

24
25

But leaving those authority questions aside,
I think the only other question is whether the

43
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Department could compile a factual record that would

2

provide a non­arbitrary basis for taking this action.

3

I ­­ I'm not sure that they could, but it's certainly

4

within their right to initiate notice and comment

5

rulemaking to try to do that.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ms. Carroll, did I

7

understand you before to be taking the position that

8

even if Congress enacted a statute of limitations with

9

an accrual rule, that that might not be effective as

10

against a plan provision that provides for the trigger

11

being proof of claim?

12

MS. CARROLL:

I ­­ I think it would be a

13

question of statutory interpretation there whether the

14

inclusion of a particular statute of limitations was

15

meant to limit contracting parties' ability to agree to

16

a different one.

17

where, you know, let's say the Court in this case

18

upholds the plan's provision and then Congress amends

19

the statute to say, you know, we really think this

20

doesn't make sense and we want to have a different rule,

21

I think there would be a strong argument that that

22

statute was intended to foreclose, as Congress may do,

23

the right of ­­ of parties to contract around that rule.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it's hard to

MS. CARROLL:

In the group ­­ in the group

5

benefit plans of the type that are subject to ERISA,

that is very common.

7

back to the older products like fire insurance, life

insurance, and so on, it would often run before proof of

loss, from the actual insured event.

­­ the reason why it's different in a long­term

disability plan is that you have to make sure that the

15

disability is actually a long­term disability.

16

that's why you have these elimination periods followed

17

by a proof of loss deadline because there has to be a

18

sustained disability in that interim period.

don't run it from an earlier point because it's not

clear that the insured event has occurred until you've

What case is that?
UNUM v. Ward, Your Honor.

10

The bigger point here is that provisions

11

that tamper with ERISA’s enforcement scheme, as this

12

provision does, are inconsistent with ERISA's remedial

13

structure.

14

enforce the contract provision.

15

By Respondent's own argument, this is not an

This is a sometimes enforcing the contract

16

provision, that is itself automatically subject to a

17

reasonableness override, in which courts can and are

18

expected to actually decline to enforce the plain

19

language of the provision in cases in which it finds,

20

under a host of fact­specific questions, the provision

21

is either unreasonable or the plan is estopped

22

from enforcing it or has waived it.

23

And that, we submit, Your Honor, is the key

24

defect with this provision because it puts courts right

25

in the center of policing what should be a private

57
Alderson Reporting Company

process.
If plans are ­­ if Courts are able to look

3

back and determine whether a plan's conduct in the

4

internal process was ­­ was unreasonable, was dilatory,

5

was unreasonably delayed, then all of a sudden the

6

private benefit resolution process, which this Court has

7

said, as have all of the lower courts that have looked

8

at it, is designed to be non­adversarial, flexible, and

9

private, turns into something that looks like none of

10

those things.

11

It turns into a process in which lawyers get

12

involved early, in which courts get involved early, and

13

in which these plan terms are subject to revision or

14

over ­­ overrides in a host of cases and in which both

15

plans and claimants have no idea ex ante whether or when

16

this provision will be enforced.

17

A rule running from final denial, which I

18

should say is the consistent rule across the board in

19

every Federal statutory regime, stated ­­ going back

20

from ­­ to the beginning of the law that we have been

21

able to find, runs the limitations clock from when you

22

can file the claim in court.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if we agree with you,

24

would the Federal courts and maybe ultimately this Court

25

in the end have to specify what the statute of
