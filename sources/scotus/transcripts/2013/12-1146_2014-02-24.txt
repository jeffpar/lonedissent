CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

Regulatory Group v. The Environmental Protection Agency

6

and the consolidated cases.

7

Mr. Keisler.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER KEISLER

9
10
11

ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE PARTY PETITIONERS
MR. KEISLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

The situation presented by this case is, to

13

our knowledge, unprecedented in at least two respects.

14

First, EPA agrees that if its interpretation of the PSD

15

and Title V statutes is adopted, then applying other

16

provisions of those same statutes would, according to

17

their terms, would in EPA's words, result in a program

18

that would have been unrecognizable to the Congress that

19

enacted it, and so contrary to Congress's intent that

20

the agency calls it absurd.

21

And second, EPA took that conclusion not as

22

a reason to reexamine its interpretation, but as a basis

23

for rewriting other provisions of the statutes that are

24

clear and unambiguous, the numerical permitting

25

thresholds that Congress enacted, because the agency

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

wrongly believes that fixes the problem.

2

not a single one­time act of statutory rewriting, as

3

problematic as that alone would be, because the agency

4

has said it intends to continually adjust and readjust

5

thresholds into the indefinite future based on its

6

ongoing assessment of the costs and benefits of

7

regulation.

8
9

And this is

So ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Keisler, I'm sorry.

Can

I ask about your interpretation of the phrase "any air

10

pollutant"?

11

interpretations that have gone on among the various

12

briefs and among the lower court opinions in this case.

13

So here are some choices, all right?

14

to ask you to pick what you're arguing for.

15

Because there are a lot of different

And I want really

Your original position was that "any air

16

pollutant" meant any NAAQS pollutant for which the area

17

is in attainment; that was your original position.

18

Judge Kavanaugh's position is that it means any NAAQS

19

pollutant.

20

the briefs that says, no, it doesn't mean any NAAQS

21

pollutant; it means any local pollutant, whether or not

22

it's a NAAQS pollutant; and there is still another

23

position that says it's really any regulated pollutant

24

other than greenhouse gases.

25

There is another position that goes on in

So those are four different interpretations

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that all of the folks on your side, and I realize there

2

are a lot of them, have presented.

3

asking you which one you're arguing for.

4

MR. KEISLER:

Yes.

And I guess I'm

Your Honor, I'm here on

5

behalf of all the Private Party Petitioners, and we have

6

two arguments.

7

would like to focus on first is that while other

8

programs of the Clean Air Act give EPA authority to

9

regulate greenhouse gases from stationary sources, PSD

Our principal argument and the one I

10

does not.

11

would choose one of the options Your Honor gave me ­­

12

and that is because the PSD program is exclusively

13

focused on emissions that have area­specific air quality

14

impacts, and not on globally undifferentiated phenomena.

15

I wouldn't use the words ­­

And that is because ­­ and this is where I

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

May I ask ­­
When you say area­specific,

18

I mean, I take it that these sort of ozone pollutants

19

are not area­specific.

20

exclude those as well?

21

Would your interpretation

MR. KEISLER:

If the EPA couldn't make a

22

regulatory finding that they had an area­specific air

23

quality impact, yes.

24
25

Now, the Solicitor ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could I ask you a

follow­up to Justice Kagan?

Now that's a fifth

7
Alderson Reporting Company

1

interpretation by your side.

2

quintessential ambiguity in a statute where we give

3

deference to the agency.

4

come to one interpretation, why shouldn't we defer to

5

the agency?

6

MR. KEISLER:

That to me is the

So if your side can't even

Well, first of all, Your

7

Honor, the deference that an agency is afforded is

8

always going to be limited to reasonable

9

interpretations, and we would start out with the premise

10

that an interpretation that requires the agency to

11

rewrite other provisions of the Act is not reasonable.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, it hasn't

13

rewritten them.

14

and I don't understand ­­ other than your view that

15

there are too many people it's regulating, is that we

16

can't implement it immediately, because it would

17

overburden us administratively.

18

over time, with streamlining and with other adjustments,

19

that it can't do this.

20

right away.

21

All it has said, as I understand it,

MR. KEISLER:

It hasn't said that

It's just said we can't do it

That's right, Your Honor.

And

22

that actually reflects a deeper problem, and I'd like to

23

address that, and then also explain why our position, we

24

think, is the correct and only correct interpretation of

25

the statute on the broader question.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

you do that, we have an outstanding question from

20

Justice Sotomayor.

21

MR. KEISLER:

22
23

There

Maybe ­­
Thank you very much, Mr.

Chief Justice.
The problem is not simply that the agency

24

rewrote the thresholds and said that it will eventually

25

try, as it did say, to get down to the level of the

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

statutory thresholds, because the reason that Congress

2

wrote those thresholds was because it wanted to exempt

3

small entities from the costs and burdens of the

4

permitting process.

5

eventually to get down to the apartment buildings and

6

large high schools that would be covered if those

7

thresholds were applied to carbon dioxide, it is

8

contravening congressional intent in another way.

9

And so when EPA says that it hopes

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I didn't read them as

10

saying that anyway.

11

to do it, but make whatever exemptions are necessary.

12

I read them as saying they'll try

MR. KEISLER:

Well, and the problem is,

13

Justice Scalia, that those exemptions violate the

14

statute as well.

15

in order to deal with the small entities that Congress

16

meant to exclude would be to have general permits by

17

category.

18

determinations are to be case by case followed by an

19

individualized hearing.

20

The exemptions they're talking about

And the statute specifically says that these

And so ­­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It ­­ it clearly is not a

21

matter of the EPA simply saying we can't do it right

22

away, but we're going to do it eventually.

23

MR. KEISLER:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

MR. KEISLER:

That's right.
It hasn't said that.
It hasn't, and if they did say

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that, they would be violating the statute in worse ways.

2

They would be treating a command by Congress not to

3

regulate small entities into a command to regulate small

4

entities.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Mr. Keisler, do you really

6

mean to say that the only difference between greenhouse

7

gases and the air pollutants that Congress clearly had

8

in mind when it enacted the Clean Air Act is that

9

greenhouse gases don't have a localized effect?

Isn't

10

there also a big difference in that the quantity of

11

greenhouse gases that are emitted by sources are much

12

greater than the quantity of these other pollutants and

13

that's why there's this discrepancy between the

14

statutory threshold and the threshold that EPA has ­­

15

MR. KEISLER:

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

17

MR. KEISLER:

That's right.
­­ substituted?
That's right, Your Honor.

And

18

I think there are really two parallel problems that

19

we're dealing with, each of which creates its own need

20

for the EPA to violate the statute in order to save it

21

for greenhouse gases.

22

One is the one that Your Honor and Justice

23

Sotomayor were referring to, which is this was a statute

24

designed for case­by­case permitting of a small number

25

of large sources that materially contribute to the

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

problem.

2

promise to regulate down to the infinitesimal level, you

3

are violating that aspect of the statute.

And whether you rewrite the thresholds or

4

But the other aspect of the statute, which

5

is equally violated here, is the requirement that this

6

particular program, not the other programs in the Act,

7

but this particular program, be focused on these

8

area­specific air quality impacts.

9

features, the three central features of the PSD statute,

10
11

And there are three

which we think show that.
The first is Section 7471, which is, I

12

think, on page 13A of the appendix to the Government's

13

brief.

14

the PSD program applies to and also explains what PSD,

15

"prevention of significant deterioration," refers to.

16

And 7471 says, "The program consists of emissions

17

limitations and other measures as may be necessary to

18

prevent significant deterioration of air quality in each

19

region that bears certain designations."

20

quality in each region" is Clean Air Act language for

21

that subset of air pollution problems that have

22

regionally­defined effects on the air that people

23

breathe.

24
25

And that is the provision that specifies what

2

passes a statute that tells the agency, do A, B, C and

3

D.

4

regulated things, that it just doesn't make sense to

5

apply A, B and C and D to all of them.

6

think courts read in an exception where it makes no

And then it turns out, since there's so many of the

14

can't we take the same approach or EPA takes the same

approach here?

16

places where it makes no sense?

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Keisler, if I could

the conundrum here, you keep saying:

violating this specific statutory term.

14

conundrum that this cases raises is that everybody is

violating a statutory term.

17

you are also violating a statutory term.

18

says any pollutant or it says in the other provision

19

think that the most natural, most reasonable readings of

those phrases are any pollutant if they have localized

22

effects, but not otherwise.

23

Look, EPA is

pollutants.

case, everybody would agree is the most reasonable

But I was in the dissent in that case, but

No, that's ­­

That's ­­ that's right, Your

And I think ­­

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And ­­ and my question is

8

along that exact same line.

Let's assume, and it's the

9

case, that we're bound by both the result and the

10

reasoning of Massachusetts and EPA, and the ­­ the

11

American Electric v. Connecticut case.

12

what regulatory force, what regulatory significance, do

13

those cases have under, A, your approach and, B, the

14

approach by the Chamber of Commerce in the blue brief?

15

I ­­ I think that may be consistent with the subject the

16

Chief Justice just opened.

17

MR. KEISLER:

Sure.

Under your view,

Let me begin with

18

Massachusetts v. EPA and then I'll turn to AEP v.

19

Connecticut.

20

interpretation of pollutant in that opinion had to be

21

applied every time the word "pollutant" appears in the

22

Clean Air Act.

23

out, this Court decided Environmental Defense v. Duke,

24

in which it specifically said that even when a defined

25

term in the statutory definition provision is construed

Massachusetts v. EPA did not hold that the

The same day that Massachusetts came

19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a particular way, that doesn't mean that that same term

2

used elsewhere in the statute can't be construed

3

differently where context requires.

4

reversed the Fourth Circuit for holding that they had to

5

be the same.

And the Court

6

And that's why in Massachusetts, after

7

indeed holding that the definition of "pollutant"

8

unambiguously in its literal sense included greenhouse

9

gases, the Court didn't stop there.

It went on to ask

10

whether applying that definition to the Title II

11

provisions on motor vehicles that were at issue in that

12

case would produce what the Court called "extreme

13

measures or counterintuitive results."

14

finding that there'd be no extreme or counterintuitive

15

results did the Court direct the EPA to apply that

16

definition to those Title II provisions.

17

And only after

And I think what that reflected was that the

18

Court understood that the literal definition of

19

"pollutant" was sufficiently broad that it shouldn't be

20

mechanically applied, plugged in everywhere in the Act

21

that the word "pollutant" appears, without some

22

additional analysis of the context of those provisions.

23
24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What else does it cover

other than Title II, other than mobile vehicles?
MR. KEISLER:

There are multiple places in

20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

which the word "pollutant" appears in the Act in which

2

the EPA has understood Mass v. EPA the way I just

3

described, in which they have interpreted the words "any

4

air pollutant" to mean only a subset of the pollutants

5

that ­­ that the definition literally could be held to

6

encompass.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's generally because

8

the section that it's in gives a different definition

9

directly.

10

MR. KEISLER:

No, that's ­­ with respect,

11

Your Honor, that's not correct.

12

PSD in Title V provisions, it says, "any air pollutant."

13

The EPA has interpreted that to mean any regulated air

14

pollutant, not because of any separate definition, but

15

because of context.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

MR. KEISLER:

You are right, but ­­
The context suggests

18

otherwise.

So, for example, in the

The same thing with the provision on

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But your ­­ your answer is

21

that they can be treated differently under different

22

parts of the Act.

23

view that we can't change the statute?

24
25

MR. KEISLER:

Doesn't that contradict your earlier

No, I don't think so, Your

Honor, because it was an act of interpretation in

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Massachusetts v. EPA of a particular term, and the

2

question is, reading that decision as a whole, what

3

import did the Court give that interpretation.

4

not have needed to go on and say, let's look at

5

specifically the Title II provisions at issue here and

6

ask whether it will produce extreme or counterintuitive

7

measures if it weren't the case that that was an

8

additional part of the inquiry that was necessary.

And what other programs

So we have the mobile vehicles.

You're saying it excludes PSD.

MR. KEISLER:

What else does

I think most critically, Your

14

Honor, it includes the new source performance standards

15

program of Section 111 that this Court discussed in

16

Connecticut v. AEP.

17

because this case is not about whether EPA can regulate

18

greenhouse gases from stationary sources.

19

held that it could under this program in Section 11.

20

And this is a very important point,

This Court

This is about whether State and local

21

permitting authorities, the 90­plus State and local

22

permitting authorities, are supposed to regulate plant

23

by plant under this particular PSD program.

24

mention the NSPS program because the features of that

25

program highlight what's wrong here because the NSPS

program doesn't contain the elements of the PSD program

2

that require the PSD program to be rewritten in so many

3

particulars to make greenhouse gases fit.

4

NSPS doesn't have the 100­ and 250­ton per

5

year thresholds.

6

rulemaking decide what categories of sources are most

7

contributing to the problem and most require regulation.

8

It doesn't require the area­specific local impact

9

analysis of subsection (e) of 7475, which EPA has told

It lets EPA by notice and comment

10

State and local permitting authorities, even though it's

11

mandatory, don't conduct it because it can't be done for

12

greenhouse gases.

13

NSPS permits the EPA to look at reducing the

14

national footprint without regard to area­specific

15

impacts, and it permits the EPA to do this through a

16

national uniform emissions standard that the plants can

17

then determine how best to meet, rather than asking 90

18

State and local permitting authorities, which is what

19

PSD is about, to decide plant by plant what they think

warming.

with them that they could do it under the other one and

thing, Your Honor.

17

having the EPA, through notice and comment rulemaking,

18

establish a national emissions standards, and then the

19

plants can deal with that incentive system in the best

20

way they can and figure out how to meet it, versus this

21

command and control PSD mechanism, where 90­plus State

22

and local permitting authorities are each having to

decide on their own what controls they think each plant

24

in their area should engage in, in order to deal with

25

global warming.

But it's not exactly the same
And it is the difference between

It makes perfect sense to have 90 State

2

area­specific air quality impacts of plants that are

3

built in their States.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

It says, "such standards

5

with such modifications as he deems appropriate."

6

That's the language of 7411(b).

7

MR. KEISLER:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.
Okay.

So if this is the

9

right program, why couldn't they copy it word for word

into the rules and just put a different section number

it, but if they disagreed with you and they think this

13

is the perfect program, why can't they do it?

14

I know you'd have a preferred way to do

MR. KEISLER:

Because the statutory language

15

and structure of the PSD program does not, we think,

encompass these kinds of pollutants that have globally

dispersed results and not area­specific impacts.

it's for the reasons that I've indicated.

Well, Connecticut v. AEP, and

the only point to make about that is that that was the

case which held that the commission ­­ that the EPA has

address greenhouse gases without having to rewrite

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The other thing ­­ you were

going to give two points and you only got to ­­ what is

25

MR. KEISLER:

There were really ­­ yes,

which we think make the context clear.

Which was 7471, prevention of

9

Right.
The second was that study, the

only required study is of local conditions and

10

area­specific impacts.

11

is assigned to 90 State and local permitting

12

authorities, which is ­­ it is not plausible to think

13

that with respect, not to these area­specific impacts,

14

but to a global problem like global warming that what

15

Congress was doing was saying we think 90 State and

16

local permitting authorities should make those decisions

17

rather than, perhaps, EPA on a national basis.

18

And the third is just that this

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You ­­ just to be clear,

19

your reading would say that the ­­ that the agency was

20

not permitted, with notice and opportunity to be heard,

21

to say ­­ to make a ­­ make this a criteria of pollution

22

in NAAQS.

23

MR. KEISLER:

If the agency had tried to

24

establish a NAAQS for greenhouse gases, we think that

25

would be contrary to the statute because the National

concentrations.

Well, why don't you

take an extra 5 minutes, and ­­ and you can begin by

10

answering the question:

11

disaggregates the discussion, and their first point in

12

their brief is that greenhouse gases can be regulated

13

with respect to sources that are already covered by the

14

PSD program.

15

concern about the broad reach of EPA regulation, does

16

it?

17

You know, the Government

That position does not implicate your

MR. KEISLER:

I think it does, Your Honor,

18

because while that might deal with the specific issue of

19

rewriting the thresholds, the fact that the PSD

20

provisions for the reasons I have indicated is limited

21

to area­specific air impacts would, we think, be

22

violated merely by applying Best Available Control

23

Technology to a globally dispersed substance like

24

greenhouse gases.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

28
Alderson Reporting Company

I understand.

But

Official

1

they would only be applying that with respect to sources

2

that are already required to operate under PSD permits.

3

MR. KEISLER:

That's right, but they would

4

be applying it to a substance, greenhouse gases, which

5

the PSD program was not designed to address, which was

6

designed to be addressed by other programs.

7

say, Your Honor, that while they have tried to separate

8

those issues out, that there's one issue about who has

9

to get a permit and the other issue about whether the

And I would

10

requirements of Best Available Control Technology apply,

11

the regulation that they have adopted to implement what

12

they call their tailoring rule applies equally to both.

13

What they've done is say that the words

14

"subject to regulation," which are the words in the BACT

15

provision, shall only apply to greenhouse gases, even

16

when they are regulated, if you're emitting them at

17

levels of 100,000 tons per year or more.

18

When they did that, they both rewrote the

19

provision that says who has to get a permit and they

20

rewrote the provision that says what Best Available

21

Control Technology applies.

22

though their brief treats it as separate.

argument that I made reference to at the very beginning,

But if not,

10

we have a second, narrower argument which is in the

American Chemistry Council brief, which addresses the

requirements for triggering the PSD statute, and our

13

position on that is very much like Judge Kavanaugh's

We are focused

on the language in any area to which this part applies,

Your Honor, it is true that

13

ever since 1980 ­­ although it proposed our

14

interpretation as its original interpretation of the

15

statute, ever since 1980, EPA has said that any

16

pollutant, whether it's a NAAQS pollutant, whether it's

17

a pollutant for which the area is in attainment, any

18

pollutant would be sufficient to trigger PSD permit

requirements.

are emitted in threshold quantities, invariably ­­ we've

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN F. MITCHELL

8

ON BEHALF OF STATE PETITIONERS

9

MR. MITCHELL:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
There are at least two issues in this case

12

in which EPA and the Petitioners agree.

13

that the term "air pollutant" cannot be given a uniform

14

construction throughout the Clean Air Act even after

15

this Court's ruling in Massachusetts that "air

16

pollutant" includes all things airborne for purposes of

17

Title II.

18

greenhouse gases cannot be treated the same as other air

19

pollutants for purposes of the PSD and Title V programs,

20

because the unambiguous statutory requirements of those

21

programs are incompatible with sensible regulation of

22

greenhouse gases.

23

The first is

The second point of agreement is that

EPA thinks it can fix this problem by

24

imposing an atextual agency­created regime that applies

25

only to greenhouse gases.

The proper response, however,

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is for EPA to conclude that Congress never delegated

2

regulatory authority over greenhouse gases in the PSD

3

and Title V programs.

4

holes for square pegs, and Brown & Williamson holds in

5

these situations, an agency cannot make a round hole

6

square by rewriting unambiguous statutory language.

7

Congress does not establish round

JUSTICE KAGAN:

General, I take it that the

8

unambiguous statutory language that you are referring to

9

is the references to 100 and to 250.

And it seems to me

10

that that's an odd kind of term to drive such an

11

important statutory interpretation question, because

12

what those numbers were all about is that they were

13

supposed to separate major emitters from minor emitters.

14

I mean, they were supposed to be about the size of the

15

facility.

16

not supposed to make any distinctions as to the type of

17

pollutant.

18

They were not supposed to have ­­ they were

So you're essentially using those numbers to

19

make distinctions as to the type of pollutant rather

20

than, it seems to me a more sensible approach would be

21

to say, look, the 100 and 250 numbers don't work for

22

this new kind of pollutant, we're going to up the

23

numbers, and that will leave the rest of the statute and

24

all the purposes of Congress intact.

25

MR. MITCHELL:

Justice Kagan, the reason we

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

don't think the approach that you describe is

2

permissible is because there are statutory provisions in

3

the Clean Air Act that specifically forbid EPA to do

4

what Your Honor is describing.

5

cannot under any circumstance exempt any major source

6

from the Title V requirements.

7

provision is in the statute, EPA cannot be claiming to

8

seize discretion when Congress has specifically withheld

9

that type of discretion here.

7661(a)(A) says that EPA

And because that

This is akin to a

10

dispensing power, for EPA to be coming in and rewriting

11

the Title V permitting thresholds in the way that they

12

are.

13

And the question to ask is whether the term

14

"air pollutant" is flexible enough to accommodate

15

different meanings in different statutory contexts.

16

here even EPA agrees with us that "air pollutant" can

17

mean different things in different parts of the Act,

18

even after Massachusetts.

19

And

Massachusetts held that "air pollutant"

20

unambiguously includes all things airborne, all airborne

21

compounds of whatever stripe for purposes of Title II.

22

But EPA has refused to carry over that definition

23

throughout the Clean Air Act when the term "air

24

pollutant" appears in at least three different places.

25

One of them is section 7411(a)(4), which is part of the

35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

NSPS program.

2

modification.

In that provision the term "air

has been established.

It interprets that to

In the PSD and Title V permitting

10

pollutant" not to mean all things airborne, but to mean

11

any regulated air pollutant.

12

And then finally, in Section 7491 EPA

13

interprets the phrase "any pollutant" to mean any

14

visibility­impairing pollutant.

15

all things airborne view of the phase "air pollutant" is

16

forced to be applied to every provision of the Clean Air

17

Act where the word "air pollutant" appears, all of these

18

longstanding EPA interpretations would have to be

19

discarded.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So if Massachusetts's

But, General, if you think

21

about the question of what any pollutant means, and you

22

put aside this whole absurdity question that the numbers

23

get you to, you just say, what does any air pollutant

24

You would obviously choose EPA's version of

MR. MITCHELL:

Because I don't think it can

be said, Justice Kagan, that the phrase "any air

And then we go

Now, that doesn't ­­ my God, that maybe

they're going to have a permit, or it doesn't mean every

5

500 people, like all of my relatives are together, they

6

have to have a permit.

7

No, it can't mean that.

So we have two choices.

Choice A, which is

what you would like, is it means any air pollutant, any

regulated air pollutant, but not greenhouse gases.

That's choice one.
Choice two is it means any air pollutant

choice one ­­

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

The reason choice one does

24

25

permissible for an agency to construe ambiguous

2

may it please the Court:
Greenhouse gases pose the same threat to

3

public health and welfare when they are emitted from a

4

power plant as when they are emitted from the tailpipe

of a car; and in American Electric Power this Court said

6

it was plain that EPA has the authority to prescribe

general rules limiting greenhouse gas emissions by

8

stationary sources like power plants.

say EPA lacks any authority to use the PSD permitting

program to regulate the same emissions, from the same

sources, causing the same harms.

12

what this provision says, I won't belabor you by reading

the lengthy provision, but what it says is that once

That what you are supposed to do under BACT is use Best

On the one hand, EPA says that applying the statutory

the Congress that enacted the program; isn't that right?

Because this is something I don't understand.

16

What EPA's doing here is saying this is a

transition, it's not a rewrite.

transition is not to gradually expand the permitting

requirement until they've got all the Dunkin' Donuts in

percent.

16

83 percent, and if you win, you can regulate 86 percent.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

General ­­ General, if I

could actually get back to Justice Alito's question,

because I had a similar issue with what EPA did here.

6

It seems to me it would be completely responsible and

7

understandable if EPA had said, look, the 100 and 250

8

don't work with respect to this category of pollutant,

9

Congress didn't know that this kind of pollutant was out

10

there when it wrote those numbers, what it was trying to

11

do was to distinguish between major and minor emitters.

12

The new numbers are X and Y for that ­­ for this kind of

13

pollutant.

14

But, you know, and I understand that EPA may

15

have felt like, oh, gosh, can we really do that?

16

the solution that EPA came up with actually seems to

17

give it complete discretion to do whatever it wants,

18

whenever it wants to, and to not ­­ and to be much more

problematic than if EPA had just said, no, it's not 100

19

itself in this ­­ in the regulations, in the rulemaking

alignment with the expectation that only large sources

22

First, that goes to the question of what
It's only the

It

10

doesn't go to the ­­ to the argument ­­ the Petitioners

11

are making a far more substantial argument, that EPA

12

lacks any authority to consider greenhouse gas emission

13

under the BACT provision and other provisions, even for

14

sources that have a permit for their emissions of

15

non­greenhouse gases.

16

So it only goes to the question of the scope

17

of the triggering provision, not to EPA's authority to

18

use PSD to regulate greenhouse gases for entities that

19

are already subject to the permit for other reasons.

20

Now, with respect to the trigger, what I

21

would say about that, Justice Scalia, is that the

22

statutory language is "any air pollutant."

23

Massachusetts against EPA, the EPA came to the

24

conclusion that that language necessarily encompasses

25

greenhouse gas emissions.

Reading

That conclusion is most

67

consistent with the EPA's statutory obligations here,

2

because if the choice ­­ and you can say the choice is

3

interpretations that are consistent with the legislative

purpose.

17

interpretations of the statute.

19

greenhouse gases for reasons that have nothing to do

argument?

There have to be plausible alternative

argument, and I think that's exactly what EPA did when

every container searched within 3 days, and it said,

6

well, what we're going to do is search the containers

7

that come from places where we think the risk is most

8

likely, I think everyone would think that that's a

9

reasonable interpretation of the ­­ of the agency's

10

charge under the statute; and that's essentially what

11

the EPA has done here.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Just to be clear, you're

13

not saying ­­ or are you saying ­­ that if you're denied

13

There's 7411, there's triggering, and then there's if ­­

14

if you're already subject to the permit.

15

questions about whether the PSD program is limited

16

entirely to pollutants that affect local ambient air

19

That's correct.

And so I think those things are

And so there really are three points.

And the

For one thing, EPA has been regulating since

20

1988 under the PSD program something called

ozone­depleting substances.

up the ozone and that then creates additional

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, that ­­

well, if

6

those local effects count, then certainly, greenhouse

7

gases have those kinds of local effects, because they

8

raise the sea levels, which cause flooding in certain

9

places and they cause droughts in other places.

And so,

10

to the extent you're talking about local effects, the

11

greenhouse gases really aren't local ­­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Where have the sea levels

15

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, certainly

Massachusetts, but ­­ but with respect ­­ but EPA has

17

been regulating ozone­depleting substances since 1988.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

19

has acquiesced in that?

20

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Is it your argument Congress

Yes.

In fact, we think

21

in 1990, that they ratified it.

22

Congress undertook a very substantial amendment of the

23

Clean Air Act.

24

address ozone­depleting substances.

25

Title VI for ozone­depleting substances, so they were

Because in 1990,

One thing they did was specifically

They created a new

ozone­depleting substances out of the PSD program at

3

that time.

4

because they did pull out hazardous air pollution ­­ air

5

pollutants, which was another new category they created

6

in 1990 for the PSD program.

7

And they did not pull

They left them in.

JUSTICE ALITO:

And that's significant

I thought there was a very

8

short time lag between EPA's assertion of the authority

to regulate the ozone­depleting substances under the PSD

program and the enactment of ­­

But ­­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So which one?

Either one

of them?
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, I've got another

thought on that subject ­­

14

(Laughter.)

15

GENERAL VERRILLI:

­­ which is, as I said to

16

Justice Alito earlier, the whole problem in terms of

17

expanding the permitting requirement is CO2.

18

that if the Court were to say that "any air pollutant"

19

can't be interpreted in the way that EPA has interpreted

20

it at the trigger level, to mean what we think it says,

21

and what Massachusetts against EPA compelled, but if the

22

Court disagrees with that, it seems to me the ­­ the

23

answer that is least problematic from EPA's point of

24

view does the ­­ is the least dissonant and the least ­­

25

causes the least risk of collateral consequences with

76
Alderson Reporting Company

And so

Official

1

respect to established regulatory programs, which go

2

beyond NAAQS pollutants under PSD, would be to say that

3

you can't read any air pollutant to include CO2, because

4

the inclusion of CO2 generates a permitting obligation

5

that is out of accord with what Congress would have

6

expected.

7

think that's ­­

8
9
10

I think ­­ I'm not endorsing that, but I

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, what ­­ what about

BACT for CO2, then?
GENERAL VERRILLI:

11

in ­­ that's just at the trigger, Justice Ginsburg.

12

Just at the trigger.

13

see, given that BACT says in unambiguous terms in

14

Section 7475(a)(4) that anybody who's subject to a

15

permit has got to meet BACT for each pollutant subject

16

to regulation under the chapter, meaning the Act.

17

just don't see how you can get out from under that ­­

18

We think that the ­­ I just don't

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I

You've got to

19

follow ­­ you've got to follow the plain text of the

20

statute there.

21

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, if the command of

22

the statute is that BACT applies for each pollutant

23

subject to regulation ­­

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah, but the plan

of the statute is 250 tons per year, too; and you've

77
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

changed that to 100,000 tons per year.

2

GENERAL VERRILLI:

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4
5

Right, but I think ­­
And you were going to get

to 7475(3),(a),(b),(c) on that point.
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, 7475(3)(c) also

6

does say that if ­­ if EPA does set a greenhouse gas

7

standard for a particular stationary source like power

8

plants, then that becomes a condition of the permit.

9

That's what (c)(3) says.

And so between (c)(3) and

10

BACT, greenhouse gas ­­ assuming that EPA acts under

11

7411, those, it seems to me, have to be in.

12

This is a question about the definition of

13

the trigger.

14

in trying to faithfully answer Your Honor's question,

15

that's what I think.

16

Now, we don't agree with it.

it's the CO2 emissions that expand the scope.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Pretty close.

But I

10

think ­­ but I think the reason that we would ­­ the

11

reason that the exclusion of CO2 seems to me to be the

12

least problematic is that EPA does have an established

13

regulatory framework here that applies not just to NAAQS

14

pollutants, but to the other non­NAAQS pollutants,

15

sulfuric acid mist and the other things that EPA

16

regulates under the PSD program.

have previously been included.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes, certainly that's

3

right.

4

argument that, as I ­­ as I read Judge Kavanaugh's

5

opinion and as I understood my friend's argument on

6

behalf of the ACC, was that the statute essentially

7

compelled the conclusion that you had to pick one or the

8

other of those alternative readings in order to avoid

9

expanding the permitting obligation.

10

Certainly, that's right.

But I think the ­­ the

And the problem with that way of thinking

11

about it is that there are many other pollutants,

12

non­NAAQS pollutants that EPA has regulated for years

13

and used as a trigger for years to require PSD permits,

14

which you would be at risk of excluding from the program

15

if you were to adopt the ACC or the Judge Kavanaugh

16

reading as triggers, and that's a problem that, it seems

17

to me, the Court ought to be thinking about trying to

18

avoid.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I have to say in reading

3

Could you just give a quick

GENERAL VERRILLI:

You know, I'm glad you

4

raised that, Justice Alito.

5

important.

6

about it in multiple ways, there are multiple pollutants

7

that are currently regulated under the PSD program.

8

Some of them have National Ambient Air Quality

9

Standards, and the local testing makes sense for those.

That's actually quite

That's just not right.

I mean, if you think

10

Others don't have National Air Quality ­­ Ambient Air

11

Quality Standards, like sulfuric acid mists, for

12

example, and others.

13

There aren't standards for those.

And the way EPA has handled that is they

14

look at the regulations.

15

of the monitoring that the statute requires, there's a

16

specific exemption for substances that are otherwise

17

regulated but for which there is no NAAQS or related

18

standard.

19

requirement.

The regulation says in terms

So they're just exempt from the monitoring

20

There's also an analysis requirement.

21

what EPA has said and what the States do in their

22

permitting processes with respect to the analysis

23

requirement for the non­NAAQS substances, for example,

24

sulfuric acid mists, is to apply a very simple idea.

25

You're not trying in that situation to make sure that

the particular emissions aren't having ­­ are consistent

It's a very

More is worse; less is better.

4

And so with respect to things like sulfuric

5

acid mist, with respect to things like ozone­depleting

6

substances, that is how it has always worked at the

7

State level under the PSD program.

8

at what the BACT emissions levels are.

9

them down.

10

You just ­­ you look
You try to get

And so you're not treating greenhouse gases

11

any differently than sulfuric acid mist or

12

ozone­depleting substances or the others that don't have

13

those requirements.

14

And then in terms of localized effects

15

versus wider effects, I mean, I would just remind the

16

Court about the EMC­Homer City case from just a few

17

months ago, it's not at all unusual that the EPA would

18

be regulating emissions in one place because they ­­

19

they impose effects hundreds or even thousands of miles

20

away.

21

The pollutants emitted in Ohio or Kentucky

22

contribute to the air pollution levels in New Haven or

23

Bangor, Maine.

24

And so ­­ and you regulate those pollutants also through

25

the PSD program.

That's what that case was all about.

And so you don't ­­ you aren't in that

area.

It's not ­­ it just doesn't work that way.

conclusion, why EPA did what it did, it is because this

is an urgent problem.

sources that were only making the incremental ­­ an

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PETER KEISLER

12

ON BEHALF OF PRIVATE PARTY PETITIONERS

13

MR. KEISLER:

14

You had asked the Solicitor General what

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

15

would BACT involve in this kind of situation.

16

think Your Honor gave a perhaps absurd hypothetical

17

about light bulbs.

18

instruction to the State and local permitting

19

authorities does address light bulbs in the cafeteria.

20

What it says is that State and local permitting

21

authorities likely ­­ likely do not need to look at

22

whether more efficient light bulbs should be used in a

23

plant's cafeteria because that would probably be not

24

worth the burden in terms of the payoff.

25

And I

Your Honor should know that EPA's

But the fact that they are talking about it

88
Alderson Reporting Company

1

at that level of detail just brings into sharp relief

2

that this PSD process when applied to greenhouse gases,

3

which is about energy efficiency, not about adding

4

technology to control the stuff that comes out of smoke

5

stacks, is pervasive in potentially affecting every

6

aspect of an industrial plant's operation and asking the

7

90 State and local permitting authorities to decide what

8

needs to be done.

9

between this and the NSPS program which functions by

10

setting emissions standards that each plant can then

11

decide how best ­­

12

And that's what is so different

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what do I do with the

13

examples in the brief of the 144 permits that have

14

already been given, people who have managed to come into

15

compliance under BACT?

16

MR. KEISLER:

It's certainly not our

17

submission that every single determination by every one

18

of these authorities is going to be unreasonable or

19

outrageous or is going to reach into the cafeterias.

20

But it is the scope of this is so different in nature

21

and kind than the NSPS program, which would set

22

efficient standards that people would be able to meet.

23

And the second point I would like to make,

24

Your Honor, is there is a selectivity about what the

25

agency considers ambiguous and unambiguous.

89
Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official

1

unambiguously is required to apply Massachusetts'

2

definition of "pollutant," but "any air pollutant" is

3

ambiguous enough to accommodate any regulated air

4

pollutant.

5

But 100 and 250 tons per year, that's really

6

ambiguous because it can mean 100,000.

7

this because the selectiveness with which EPA has turned

8

the ambiguity on and off, so that in combination it

9

maximizes the agency's discretion shows that when we

And I mention

10

talk about what is ­­ what does the least violence to

11

the statute, we have to think about it, among other

12

things, along the parameter of separation of powers and

13

whether the way in which the agency has perceived it

14

here has arrogated an exceptional and troubling degree

15

of discretion to design its own climate change program.

16

And finally, with respect to the different

17

definitions of pollutant, we have certainly proceeded

18

here as if we are defining that particular word in the

19

statute, but here is another way to think about the

20

interpretative exercise here and that is Brown &

21

Williamson.

22

assumption that the definitions in the statute of drug

23

and device encompassed nicotine and cigarettes, but then

24

it went on to say that giving the FDA jurisdiction under

25

those programs over tobacco would be inconsistent with

Brown & Williamson started with the

90
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

the regulatory structure that Congress enacted.
And when it did that, it didn't go back to

3

those definitions and say, we have to now figure out

4

which word in that definition means something different

5

than what we originally assumed.

6

interpretation as a whole conflicted with the statute as

7

a whole and that was sufficient.

8

true here.
