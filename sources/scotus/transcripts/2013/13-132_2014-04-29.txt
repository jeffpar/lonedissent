ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8

MR. FISHER:

9

please the Court:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

This case involves applying the core

11

protection of the Fourth Amendment to a new factual

12

circumstance.

13

occasion of an arrest did not give the police officers

14

authority to search through the private papers and the

15

drawers and bureaus and cabinets of somebody's house,

16

and that protection should not evaporate more than 200

17

years after the founding because we have the

18

technological development of smartphones that have

19

resulted in people carrying that information in their

20

pockets.

21

It has always been the case that an

2

and the safety of the community?

3

MR. FISHER:

Well, what this Court said in

4

Robinson at Page 235 is the reason supporting the

5

authority for a search incident to arrest are the two

6

Chimel factors, which are gathering evidence to prevent

7

its destruction, and officer's safety.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Now ­­

What about gathering

evidence in order to make the case?

20

that they can do all that.

21

Once the gun is in the police ­­ the police

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So ­­ so if ­­ if the

22

proposition then, if the principle then is that some

23

objects that are obtained from the arrestee can be

24

examined in order to build the State's case, is that at

25

least a beginning premise that we can accept in your

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

case, although, obviously, there are problems of the

2

extent and intrusiveness of the search that are ­­ are

3

in your case, but not in the gun hypothetical.

4

MR. FISHER:

Well, Justice Kennedy, the

5

Court has never described that as one of the things.

6

you want to think about this case the way you thought

7

about the automobile search in Gant, it would be a

8

beginning premise; but I think you're right, that even

9

if that were a beginning premise, it would be only that,

If

10

a beginning.

11

that any search incident to arrest still has to satisfy

12

the Fourth Amendment's general ­­ general

13

reasonableness.

14

In Footnote 9 in Edwards, this Court said

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think you're right that

15

Gant is probably the best statement in support of the

16

principle that I've ­­ I've suggested, and then you

17

might say, well, that's limited to automobiles ­­

18

MR. FISHER:

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

where we started.

21

MR. FISHER:

Right.
­­ and then we're back

Right.

And there's important

22

things to understand if you want to start thinking about

23

Gant, because both in terms of its history and its

24

modern application, it's dramatically different from

25

what we have here.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, Mr. Fisher, before we

2

do that, have you been accurate in what you said about

3

Robinson and about the Court's cases?

4

was quoted in Robinson, the Court said:

5

always recognized under English and American law, to

6

search the person of the accused when legally arrested

7

to discover and seize the fruits or evidences of crime."

8

Is that historically inaccurate?

9

repudiate that?

10

MR. FISHER:

In Weeks, which
"The right,

Do you want us to

No, Your Honor.

What Weeks

11

said, you quoted it, fruits and instrumentalities of the

12

crime have always been something that could be seized

13

from a person.

14

said in Robinson itself, was dicta.

15

historical authority to take fruits and evidence ­­ I'm

16

sorry ­­ fruits and instrumentalities of the crime.

17
18

Now, Weeks, of course, as this Court

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Did it say

instrumentalities or evidence?

19

MR. FISHER:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

evidence.

22

one of you wrong?

23

MR. FISHER:

And there was that

Which did it say?

Weeks used ­­
Because Justice Alito said

You ­­ you changed it to instrumentality.

Is

Weeks uses the word "evidence,"

24

but, Justice Scalia, because it was not at issue in that

25

case, the ­­ the Bishop treatise that you cited in your

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Thornton concurrence talks about tools and

2

instrumentalities.

3

Now, I don't think we have to debate that

4

here, because even if we're in a world where the police

5

can seize some evidence and keep it and use it for the

6

prosecution simply for that reason, even if they don't

7

fear destruction, there are still very, very profound

8

problems with searching a smartphone without a warrant,

9

because even under the Robinson rule, this Court has

10

recognized, for example, when it comes to blood draws,

11

search ­­ something like a strip search that might occur

12

at the scene, there are limits even to the Robinson

13

rule.

14

So it brings us ­­
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, smartphones ­­

15

smartphones do present difficult problems.

16

21

could examine the photos in his billfold and use those

22

as evidence against him?

23

But let me

Suppose your client were an old­school

Do you dispute the proposition that the police

MR. FISHER:

No.

That's the rule of

24

Robinson, that any physical item on an arrestee can be

25

seized and inspected and then used as evidence if it's

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

useful evidence.

We draw a line.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes.

­­
What is the difference

3

between looking at hardcopy photos in a billfold and

4

looking at photos that are saved in the memory of a cell

5

phone?

6

MR. FISHER:

The difference is digital

7

information versus physical items.

8

the scene can pose a safety threat and have destruction

9

possibilities that aren't present with digital evidence.

Physical items at

10

What is more, once you get into the digital world, you

11

have the framers' concern of general warrants and the ­­

12

the writs of assistance.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, how does that apply ­­

14

how does that apply to these hardcopy photos in the

15

billfold?

16

I don't see that there's much of a difference between ­­

17

the government argues there's a greater risk of the

18

destruction of digital evidence in a cell phone than ­­

19

than there is in the photos.

20

understand how ­­ how that applies to that situation.

21

They don't present a threat to anybody.

MR. FISHER:

And

So I don't quite

Well, let me take those one

22

thing at a time.

23

is the theory the government itself propounded, is that

24

any physical item, because it contained a razor blade or

25

a pin or anything, needs to be inspected to be sure.

I take it the theory of Robinson, this

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And so you have a categorical rule because of the ad hoc

2

nature of arrests that police don't have to distinguish

3

physical items one from the other.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but the ­­ but in

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, they turn ­­ they turn

the card over.

16

MR. FISHER:

I think that is fine under the

17

categorical rule.

I think what you have in Robinson is

18

a categorical rule that obviates these exact difficult

19

case­by­case determinations.

20

and if I needed to, if it were a diary case or a

21

billfold case, you might be able to make an argument,

22

but I think the Court wisely decided under Robinson that

23

we need a categorical rule that's easily administrable

24

in the field.

25

You can make an argument,

Now, when you have digital evidence, the

9
Alderson Reporting Company

1

categorical rule, we submit, cuts exactly in the

2

opposite direction.

3

the notion of flipping through photos in a smartphone

4

implicates vast amounts of information, not just the

5

photos themselves, but the GPS locational data that's

6

linked in with it, all kinds of other information that

7

is intrinsically intertwined in smartphones.

Because most of the information on

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

More ­­ more or less

5

it's a hundred people.

6

in the sense that many of the other applications are.

7

I mean, you know, maybe it's 20 people; maybe

MR. FISHER:

But it's certainly not private

I think it's fair to say you

8

have a sliding scale and there's some stuff on a phone

9

that might be posted on the Internet, for example.

The

10

difficulty with that case, if you wanted to address it

11

in a future case, would be the intertwined nature of

12

information on a phone.

13

14

the phone; it will be linked to GPS information inside

15

the phone.

16

think you'd have a difficult administrability problem if

17

you wanted to create some sort of rule like that.

18

So looking at those photos in a

All of this information is intertwined and I

Now, remember, the government might try to

19

deal with that problem differently by saying information

20

in the cloud, so to speak, is not accessible to

21

officers.

22

the difficulty of applying a rule in this circumstance.

23

We submit that just further would compound

JUSTICE ALITO:

But do you think in this

24

case we have to decide whether all the information that

25

may be available in a smartphone can be examined by the

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

police when the owner of the phone is arrested or can we

2

just focus on the particular evidence that was admitted

3

in your client's trial?

4

MR. FISHER:

Well, the way you've phrased

5

the question, I think that's what ­­ that's the first

6

cut at this, is looking at the particular pieces of

7

evidence here, which are photos and videos.

8

don't think you can write an opinion that would

9

distinguish those from anything else on a ­­ almost

But we

10

11

argument here is that those are not, quote,

12

"fundamentally different" from other things that people

13

would carry around.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean, the State's

Do you think you could

15

have obtained a warrant ­­ or that the police could have

16

obtained a warrant in this case?

17
18

MR. FISHER:

In all likelihood, yes, Justice

Kennedy.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

MR. FISHER:

21
22

All right.
And they had plenty of time to do

so.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, then the evidence

23

that's seizable under the warrant is ­­ is reasonable,

24

and Justice Alito points out the fact that some of this

evidence is ­­ is reasonable.

If there's a ­­ there's a

4

MR. FISHER:

Well, let me say a couple

5

important things about the warrant requirement and then

6

return to Justice Alito's question.

7

time and again that the mere fact the police could have

enough information of enough different kinds on this

device and the police spend enough time looking at it,

5

they could build the kind of near­remarkable portrait

that some of the Justices alluded to in Gant, or, sorry,

different from what has ever been done before.

there's a possibility you could get to that kind of

qualitatively different search, but it is miles away

from this kind of case and from the heartland case.

We think

throw a phone into a Faraday bag, which is supposedly

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

They're not just

They're looking for

Well, the tax return

that's on ­­ some ­­ some cell phones have tax returns,

14

so you have the tax return of the jaywalker, looking for

15

a crime.

16

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, and I ­­ and I ­­ I would

17

acknowledge, Justice Kennedy, that if the Court is

18

looking for a rule that limits the ability of police to

19

search cell phones, because cell phones are different

20

from paper items in some respects, but not all, that the

21

most reasonable rule to apply would be one that says

22

when there is reason to believe that there's evidence of

23

the crime of arrest on the phone, the officers can look

24

for that.

25

When there is not, they can't.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That will ­­

Can I ask you a question

53
Alderson Reporting Company

1

about that, Mr. Dreeben, because given the variety of

2

things that these cell phones have in them, it seems as

3

though that's ­­ you know, it sounds good as a limiting

4

principle, but it ends up you can imagine in every case

5

that the police could really look at everything.

6

So I'll give you an example.

It's sort of

7

like this case.

8

and now we're going to look at all the various things

9

that might be related to a gun crime.

Somebody is arrested for a gun crime

So whether he's

10

bought guns, whether ­­ you know, what ­­ what ­­

11

whether he's done searches for gun stores.

12

might something say something about gun possession or

13

gun purchase.

to that crime, couldn't it?

His e­mails

He might have photographs of him with a

You know, the whole range of things could relate

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Kagan, I would

18

circumstances and for certain crimes.

20

other of the minor crimes, seat belt violations, that

21

are posited on the other side of the equation for

22

Respondent's or Petitioner's narrower approach to cell

23

phone searches.

24
25

It would not be

But I do think that a couple of things are
worth thinking about.

First, in a serious offense like

54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a firearms offense in this case, a drug offense in

2

Wurie, if the police didn't ­­ went, got a warrant, they

3

would be looking at all the same things, because the

4

only way to execute the warrant on the phone would be to

5

engage in at least a cursory search of everything on the

6

phone to see whether it related.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, they would be looking

8

at the same things, but the whole idea of a warrant is

9

that a neutral magistrate tells you that you can look at

10

those things and has an opportunity to limit it in

11

whatever way the neutral magistrate feels is

12

appropriate ­­

13

MR. DREEBEN:

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

15

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I ­­
­­ and that's a protection.
I ­­ I'm not sure that I would

16

go so far as to say the neutral magistrate can narrow

17

the warrant in any way that he sees appropriate.

18

Court's decisions in Grubbs and Dalia say that it's not

19

appropriate for the magistrate to prescribe the manner

20

of executing the search.

This

21

But I think the more fundamental point, and

22

this is why I tried to start with the basic bedrock of

23

Robinson, is that there is a different balance ­­

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

MR. DREEBEN:

Go ahead, please.

There is a different balance

at the moment of the arrest.

interests are at their apogee in locating evidence

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. FISHER:

11

I think I heard about four or five different

Thank you.

12

proposed rules that I want to just go through, each of

13

them, one at a time.

14

First, the State talked about a, quote,

15

"fundamentally different rule," and I think Justices

16

have already figured out what we say at page 17­18 of

17

our reply brief, which is that would sweep in virtually

18

everything on the phone.

19

To the extent it wouldn't, you'd have a

20

really difficult struggle on a case­by­case basis to

21

answer the very difficult question whether any

22

particular app had fundamentally different information

23

that existed in the nondigital world.

24

I also heard a suggestion, that, well, if a

25

laptop or a smartphone is on somebody's person, that's

56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

different than if it's sitting next to them.

2

correct if what the government says about its Chimel ­­

3

about passwords and wiping satisfies Chimel.

4

Chimel gives authority to search and seize without a

5

warrant anything in the grab area if there's a

6

destruction argument.

7

sitting at his desk at the office, in reaching area from

8

his computer would be open to a full search under the

9

government's rule.

10

That's not

Remember,

So the person who's arrested

There was also discussion about the

11

exigencies at the scene of an arrest, needing to prevent

12

a remote wipe, preventing a password from kicking in.

13

The first thing to make sure you understand is those

14

arguments can apply only at the scene.

15

in this case, where an officer takes the phone back to

16

the police station and 2 hours later searches through it

17

as his ­­ at his leisure.

18

the scene and what the officer needs to be able to do at

19

the scene can be left for another case.

20

They don't apply

So all the arguments about at

And I think Justice Breyer is exactly right.

21

At the very best what the government has shown is that

22

there may be certain tightly limited circumstances where

23

exigent circumstances would apply.

24
25

And I want to say a just quick thing on the
password question in particular, which we didn't talk

57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

about but may come up in the next argument.

2

14 of our reply brief, we outline how highly unusual as

3

a factual matter it would be for a smartphone to be

4

seized while it's still unlocked and for an officer not

5

to be able to address concern at the scene that it might

6

lock later.

7

footnote we attach, the government is arguing in lower

8

courts that even if it does lock, that the Fifth

9

Amendment does not give the person the opportunity to

10

refuse to divulge the password in ­­ in response to a

11

warrant.

12

Pages 12 to

And it's also worth noting that in a

So the password argument doesn't have any

13

play if the government wins the argument its making in

14

the lower courts.

15

Justice Kennedy, you suggested the

16

possibility of distinguishing between serious and

17

nonserious offenses.

18

this Court's decisions in Robinson and Atwater, where

19

that issues was squarely presented, preclude that kind

20

of a ­­ a determination for all the reasons the

21

government argued in those cases.

22

I think, with all due respect,

And then finally, Justice Scalia, you, I

23

think, had mentioned a couple times the Gant principle

24

as applied to this case, evidence that you think you

25

might find on a phone.

Well, there's two profound

58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

problems with that.

2

recognized in Kyllo, you need to be sure to protect the

3

amount of privacy people had at the founding.

4

The first is, as the Court

And as I said in my opening, the fact that

5

somebody might incidentally have an item on his person,

6

even in the rare case, diary or address book, are

7

leagues away from the kind of information people have

8

now that were stored in the home and that were

9

sacrosanct at an arrest, and that's what the thread

10

throughout history says is an arrest cannot be an

11

occasion to do that kind of a search.

12

And, Justice Kagan, you're exactly right.

13

If you run the Gant test through the world of crimes,

14

the government might be able to identify a crime here or

15

there that would be difficult to make an argument about.

16

But lots of minor crimes, like speeding, as we point out

17

in our brief, DUI, littering, all kinds of minor crimes,

18

the person can make a fairly convincing argument

19

sometimes that evidence on the phone would be relevant

20

to that crime of arrest.

21

And so I think that brings me to where I

22

want to end, which is understanding what the rule the

23

government propounds would do in terms of just ordinary

24

police work.

25

stop for an expired license plate.

Remember, this case starts with a traffic

59
Alderson Reporting Company

It is everyday

Official

1

police work that traffic stops are the beginning of

2

criminal investigations and a leverage point into

3

searches.

4

If you adopt a rule that says, even a Gant

5

rule, that says if you can make an argument that

6

evidence on the phone would be relevant to the crime of

7

arrest, take the suspended license, you may have an

8

e­mail from the DMV telling you you better come in and

9

renew.

If that opens up every American's entire life to

10

the police department, not just at the scene but later

11

at the station house and downloaded into their computer

12

forever, I think you will fundamentally have changed the

13

nature of privacy that Americans fought for at the

14

founding of the Republic and that we've enjoyed ever

15

since.

16
