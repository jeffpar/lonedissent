CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Waxman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. WAXMAN:

9

please the Court:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

In Atkins v. Virginia, this Court held that

11

the Constitution bars executing persons with mental

12

retardation; that is, persons with significantly

13

subaverage intellectual function concurrent with

14

deficits in adaptive behavior with an onset before the

15

age of 18.

16

Because of the standard error of measurement

17

that's inherent in IQ tests, it is universally accepted

18

that persons with obtained scores of 71 to 75 can and

19

often do have mental retardation when those three prongs

20

are met.

21

that ­­

23

The statistical error of measurement or SEM is

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Waxman, a line has

to be drawn somewhere.

24

And we did say in Atkins that we would leave

25

it up to the States to determine the standards for this

Alderson Reporting Company

issue.

2

them 70 is not okay, but 75 would be?

3

sure.

4

So what's the rule we announce today?

We tell

I'm not quite

How would you announce the rule?
MR. WAXMAN:

Let me first take ­­ take some

5

issue, with all due respect, with your characterization

6

of Atkins.

7

we leave it to the States to establish the standards for

8

the clinical condition of mental retardation.

What this Court said in Atkins is not that

9

What you said, quoting Ford, is, "We leave

10

it to the States to ­­ we leave to the States the task

11

of developing appropriate ways to enforce the

12

constitutional restriction that we announce."

13

The rule that we advocate is ­­ and the only

14

real question presented in this case is just this:

15

State conditions the opportunity to demonstrate mental

16

retardation on obtained IQ test scores, it cannot ignore

17

the measurement error that is inherent in those scores

18

that is a feature, statistical feature of the test

19

instrument itself.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If a

But ­­ but we didn't ­­ we

21

didn't base our decision in Atkins upon a study of what

22

the American Psychiatric Association and other medical

23

associations considered to be mental retardation.

24

based it on what ­­ what was the general rule that

25

States had adopted.

We

And a large number of States had

3

retardation that should make it impossible to impose the

4

death penalty.

We didn't look for the answer to that

6

question to the APA or any of the other medical

7

associations.

8

10

We looked to what the States did.

Now, what has changed in what the States do?
Anything?
MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Scalia, I have ­­ I

11

would like to respond with four points, and I hope

12

desperately I'll remember them.

13

First of all, what this Court said was, this

14

Court ­­ number one, it made clear, as it has reiterated

15

in Miller v. Alabama and Graham v. Florida, that while a

16

consensus or a perceived consensus among the States is

17

important, the ultimate test is this Court's conclusion

18

about what the Eighth Amendment does or doesn't allow.

19

In making that determination at page 318 of

20

this Court's opinion in Atkins, this Court, after

21

reciting in Footnote 3 the virtually identical clinical

22

definitions of mental retardation, and in Footnote 5,

23

pointing out that 70 to 75 is the established cutoff for

24

mental retardation, this Court said the following:

25

Quote, "Clinical definitions of mental retardation

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

require" ­­ and it recited the three tests.

2

their impairments, mentally retarded persons by

3

definition" ­­ that is by the clinical definition ­­

4

"have diminished capacities to understand" ­­ and it

5

recited all the other disabilities that made the

6

imposition of the death penalty for persons with that ­­

7

excuse me ­­ with that clinical condition

8

unconstitutional.

9

"Because of

Now, as to what the States did, the Court

10

did refer to, I believe, 18 State statutes.

11

single one of those State statutes and not a single

12

decision of the highest court of any State or any court

13

in any State applied 70 or two standard deviations from

14

the mean without reference to the SEM.

15

Not a

The only statute that addressed it in 2002,

16

when this Court decided Atkins, was Arizona, which

17

expressly provided that the SEM must be taken into

18

account in evaluating the ­­ an obtained IQ test score.

19
20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The SEM being ­­ being what

and ­­ and established by whom?

21

MR. WAXMAN:

The standard error of

22

measurement, which is established by the creators of the

23

test.

24

It's not something that is decided by the AAIDD or the

25

American Psychiatric Association.

It is not something that clinicians dream up.

6
Alderson Reporting Company

It is inherent in the

Official

1

test.

2

associations make clear, because it is simply a

3

statistical fact, it must be taken into account such

4

that an obtained IQ test score is actually the result of

5

an obtained IQ test score, is a test band that accounts

6

for the standard.

7

And all clinicians are told ­­ both professional

For what purpose do they

I assume it is for people who would profit from medical

treatment.

What are ­­ upper limit for what?

Isn't that it?

MR. WAXMAN:

There are many reasons why a

5

person's IQ, that is, a person's intelligent ­­

6

intellectual functioning, may be important for a whole

7

variety of reasons, medical, psychological,

8

developmental, and as a component of the clinical

9

condition of mental retardation, the Eighth Amendment.

10
11

Now, what intellectual ­­

Mr. Waxman, could we just

12

clarify one thing, that what you refer to as the SEM,

13

that is not limited to IQ of 70, 75.

MR. WAXMAN:

That's across the

MR. WAXMAN:

question?

May I come back to something similar to what

In your view, does

MR. WAXMAN:

Can it do that?
I think it can because that

falls ­­ because the standard definition of prong one,

7

that is, intellectual functioning, is two or more

8

standard deviations below the mean.

MR. WAXMAN:

All right.

I'm sorry.

intellectual function, it has to take into account the

standard error of measurement.

like Mississippi and Oklahoma that, in fact, establish a

17

23

that the defendant has to meet?

24
25

MR. WAXMAN:

Does the Eighth Amendment

Can they assign that to the

So I ­­ the short answer is, I

believe, what I will come to is yes, so that you see

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

where I'm going.

2

constitutional for the State to assign the burden of

3

proving mental retardation on the defendant.

4

insofar as the clinical definition recognized by this

5

Court in Atkins is a three­part conjunctive test, I

6

think it's fair to say that a logical consequence of

7

that is that as to every component the burden may

8

constitutionally be placed on the defendant.

9

But we believe that it is entirely

And

Now, the burden with respect to prong one is

10

the burden of proving significantly subaverage

11

intellectual functioning, of which a true IQ score is a

12

probabilistic piece of evidence.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

I don't think ­­

Why can't the State ­­ you

14

told me that the State can establish a hard cutoff.

15

you told me that a State can assign the burden to the

16

defendant.

And

17

Now, in the case of someone who scores 75,

18

is it not the case that there's roughly ­­ there's no

19

more than a 2.5 percent chance that that person's real

20

IQ is 70.

21

proof that might be ­­ any standard of proof that might

22

be assigned on that ­­ on that point?

23

don't understand about your argument.

24
25

So how does that square with any burden of

MR. WAXMAN:
explain this.

That's what I

I think ­­ let me see if I can

No, I understand.
Okay.
But I'm talking about the

Just hypothetically ­­

MR. WAXMAN:

As ­­ as to the general issue,

7

let me ­­ let me ­­ let me state it this way:

8

idea behind measurement error is that you can't make a

9

valid judgment that somebody doesn't have a true score

The whole

10

of 70 or below if the obtained score is within the

11

measurement error.

12

the ­­ your question suggests and the State's suggestion

13

suggests that diagnosing mental retardation, which is

14

the constitutional inquiry, is just a probabilistic

15

inquiry into a person's, quote, "true" IQ score.

16

true IQ scores themselves are a statistical concept.

17

It's the score that you would get on a hypothetical test

18

that had no measurement error.

19

my point ­­ true IQ is not the same as intellectual

20

function and IQ tests themselves, however perfect they

21

may be, don't perfectly capture a person's intellectual

22

function, which is why ­­

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

And even more fundamental than that,

But

The person does not ­­ does not ­­ does

MR. WAXMAN:

So I ­­ what I'm ­­ this ­­

5

this would not be a standard I would endorse, but I

6

believe that in light of the consensus test that all

7

professional organizations apply that was recognized in

8

Atkins, a score that is above the standard error of

9

measurement of two standard deviations above the mean

10

would be okay.

11

seems to me is not true, which is we know for a fact

12

that many, many people who obtain test scores of 71 to

13

75, in fact, have mental retardation.

But the point ­­ the converse point it

14

And if I just may point out that in this

case, there were six experts who fully examined Mr.

Hall or supervised a full examination of Mr. Hall.

25

and the district court said that that was so because all

12

We ­­ one of the two grounds that we

13

appealed to the Florida Supreme Court on, in addition to

14

the hard cutoff at 70, was the fact that in fact an

We don't need to consider that question

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, what ­­ there was

21

nothing that limited you to the retrospective proof.

22

The ­­ the trial judge asked a simple question, how did

23

the defendant adapt in prison, and quotes one expert as

24

saying:

25

why I didn't do it."

I don't know

limited to the testimony of two of ­­ I believe actually

5

only one of the experts who examined him and did the

adaptive testing function, and that expert did say that

7

he didn't test in prison.

8

Now, as ­­ there is, again, a universal

9

professional consensus that adaptive functioning is

10

tested by adaptive functioning in the real world, not

11

adaptive functioning that occurs on ­­ after 35 years on

12

death row.

13

And, in fact, we also know to a clinical

14

certainty that because mental retardation is a condition

that is both developmental and not transient, that is,

16

there has to be an onset ­­ demonstrated onset during

17

determination that this is the margin of error that

17

gives you a 95 percent confidence.

I guess the question here or one question

here is why do we have a 95 percent ­­ why do we need a

20

95 percent confidence level?

21

And you could say it either way.

You could

say, gosh, we're putting somebody to death, we should ­­

23

3

to 80 percent.

4

We should, you know, ration it down

So why for this purpose do we have to go

5

with the test maker's determination that 5 is what gives

6

you a 95 percent confidence level?

7

MR. WAXMAN:

So the fact that two SEMs gives

8

you a 95 percent confidence level is just the

statistical fact.

I take your question to be, well, why

use it for a wide variety of purposes.

Why does their determination that it's useful for a wide

variety of purposes to have a 95 percent confidence

level, why is the State stuck with that for this

20

purpose?

21

MR. WAXMAN:

The question is:

Because the whole ­­ and this

22

goes to the reason that they use it.

23

they use it is because of the inherent imprecision in

testing in general, but in particular testing for the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLEN WINSOR

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4

MR. WINSOR:

5

please the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

6

This Court should affirm the decision of the

7

Florida Supreme Court because it represents a reasonable

8

legislative judgment and one that is fully consistent

9

with Atkins and the Eighth Amendment.

I would like to

10

start by responding to your question, Justice Alito,

11

about what ­­ what do you do with multiple scores.

12

in fact in this case we're not talking about someone who

13

had one or two IQ scores.

14

And

When you look at the Wechsler test, which is

15

what the Petitioner contends is the gold standard, he

16

had test scores of 71, 72, 73, 74 and 80.

17

understand, what the Petitioner would have this Court do

18

is to take some of those lower scores and simply

19

subtract 5 points from them.

20

with ­­ with the materials that he cited in the footnote

21

in his brief.

22

they do apply some statistical principles to a range of

23

scores, but they do not simply take the lowest score and

24

subtract 5 points from it.

25

And as we

That is not consistent

If you look at the example there, they ­­

And the logic of that, I would submit, is

26

1

fairly obvious.

2

take in this case, you have an ­­ a low IQ on the

3

Wechsler of 71 and a high IQ on the Wechsler of 80, and

4

say at the same time that there is a 95 percent chance

5

his score is between 75 and 85 and also a 95 percent

6

chance that his score is between 66 and 76.

7

You couldn't have a situation where,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you want us to decide

8

this case and establish the principle, the ­­ the very

9

significant principle that where you have a ­­ a

10

criminal defendant condemned to death for ­­ for murder

11

whose scores are 71, 72, 73, 74, and 80, that's okay?

12

That's all you're trying to persuade us of?

13

I mean, I'm not very happy having to go

14

through this in all future cases where you have somebody

15

who has 69, 73, 74, 75, and 81.

16

some more general principle, other than the particular

17

scores in this case are good enough.

18

MR. WINSOR:

I mean, don't you have

Well, we certainly think the

19

21

are dealing with things like mental diagnosis or things

in the medical field generally, that there is good

23

reason for this Court to do as it has historically,

24

which is to defer to reasonable legislative judgments.

5

MR. WINSOR:

essentially what your cutoff does is it stops that in

MR. WINSOR:

Well, the adaptive functioning

is a critical component, but even the guidelines that

the decisionmaker who is relying on the IQ for whatever

There is an SEM that's

published that's a part of the ­­ of the test, but the

11

decisionmaker who's relying on an IQ test score, to take

your example about someone in a school, they can set

that as high or low as they want to, because they might

16

And that's one of the areas where, what

we're dealing with here in the Atkins context is

fundamentally different because we have an adversarial

16

Well, there is a 95 percent chance that my IQ is

17

somewhere between, say, 68 and 78, that you have not

18

satisfied that first prong.

19

And I would like to talk about the 95

percent confidence interval, because it is not the case

21

that you have, say, with a 72 a 95 percent chance that

22

24
25

In fact, it's a very small

What the ­­ what the confidence interval
measures is that you have a 95 percent chance that your

5

It falls under the

you take, the odds ­­ that ­­ that's above 70, the odds

would go down.

14

And so it's simply not the case that you can

18

MR. WINSOR:

Only four, like Florida.
No, Your Honor, we have eight.

19

We have Alabama, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, North

20

Carolina, and Virginia, and Maryland, which has repealed

21

the death penalty, but ­­ but that was their standard

22

when they have it.

23

We would ask respectfully that the Court

24

affirm the Florida Supreme Court.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH WAXMAN

3
4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WAXMAN:

In State v. Cherry, which is

5

the ­­ the Florida Supreme Court decision that

6

established this rule that if you ­­ if your lowest

7

score or your only score is 71, you are out, and that

8

applies whether you take one test or multiple tests ­­

9

here I'm quoting from the Supreme Court's decision in

10

Cherry, that, quote, "It is a universally accepted

11

given, that is that the SEM is a universally accepted

12

given, and as such should logically be considered in

13

determining whether a defendant has mental retardation."

14

What the Court said was:

We have to read

15

the plain meaning of the Florida statute and the Florida

16

statute says two standard deviations.

17

The notion that the Florida legislature or

18

the ­­ may I finish my sentence ­­ the Florida

19

legislature or the people of Florida have made a

20

considered decision not to account for the SEM is

21

baseless and is belied by the ­­ the legislative report

22

that accompanies the statute which said 70 to 75.

23

Thank you.

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

Mr. Waxman, counsel.
