CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Messenger.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM L. MESSENGER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

MR. MESSENGER:

9

it please the Court:

10

We'll hear argument

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

Illinois is forcing Susan Watts and

11

thousands of other home care providers to pay compulsory

12

fees to the SEIU to petition the State about its

13

Medicaid program that pays for their services to persons

14

with disabilities, in Mrs. Watts' case, her daughter

15

Libby.

16

This violates the First Amendment because

17

the purpose of this mandatory association is inherently

18

expressive, petition the government for a redress of

19

grievances, otherwise, lobby.

20

program ­­

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And also because this

I thought it was to

22

negotiate what's typically negotiated in collective

23

bargaining; that is, wages, is that not so?

24

benefits?

25

MR. MESSENGER:

Wages and

The subjects of bargaining

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

here are the reimbursement rates given to the providers,

2

and the State now offers or pays money to the SEIU for a

3

health benefit, but that is petitioning the government

4

with regard to those negotiations.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But how does it differ

6

from the typical bargaining that a union does?

7

for a wage rate, and it asks for various benefits.

8

are you saying that when it's a public ­­ in the public

9

sector, it gets converted into something else?

10

MR. MESSENGER:

Yes.

It asks
So

When ­­ in the public

11

sector, when a group is petitioning the government for

12

money, that is, petitioning the government over a public

13

program, here from a Medicaid program, it would be very

14

little different than if the American Medical

15

Association was asking for higher Medicaid rates for

16

doctors or for nurses.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is your argument

18

dependent on this being sort of a dual employee

19

situation, that it's reimbursement, as opposed to

20

policemen, fire ­­ police people, fire people, teachers,

21

other public ­­ other public employees who are directly

22

employed by the State?

23

MR. MESSENGER:

That is our position for why

24

Abood is distinguishable on that point, is that, here,

25

the State is not the common law employer or the sole

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

employer of these providers.

2

their services, much like a health insurer pays for the

3

services of medical professionals.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It simply pays them for

But your argument, of

5

course, isn't limited to that.

6

situation?

7

MR. MESSENGER:

It goes beyond that

Yes.

And that the ­­ the

8

actual bargaining, even on behalf of true employees, is

9

also petitioning and political in nature, and for that

10
11

reason Abood should be overruled.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is there any likelihood

12

that the union that represents these ­­ what do I call

13

them ­­ healthcare workers, health providers ­­ care

14

providers, is there any likelihood that they would try

15

to bargain for benefits for these ­­ these workers?

16

MR. MESSENGER:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Would the union attempt to?
Yes, yes.

Is there any

18

likelihood?

19

likelihood would be for certain subjects to be brought

20

up in the bargaining with the State?

21

Do we know anything about what the

MR. MESSENGER:

Well, one thing that has

22

happened, this is in the collective bargaining

23

agreement, is the State has agreed to give certain

24

amounts of money to an SEIU healthcare fund to offer

25

access to health benefits for those providers.

5
Alderson Reporting Company

So the

Official

1

State is funding the SEIU's health benefit program to

2

that extent.

3
4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Did they have that

before the union?

5

MR. MESSENGER:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.
Suppose you have a

7

policeman who ­­ who is dissatisfied with his wages.

8

he makes an appointment with the commissioner ­­ police

9

commissioner, and he goes in and grouses about his

10

wages.

So

He does this ­­ you know, 10 or 11 times.

11

And the commissioner finally is fed up, and

12

he tells his secretary, I don't ­­ I don't want to see

13

this man again.

Has he violated the Constitution?

14

MR. MESSENGER:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16
17

No.
He has prevented a petition

for a redress of grievances?
MR. MESSENGER:

No, because in that ­­ with

18

an individual speaking, it's, sir, a matter of private

19

or internal proprietary matter that, under this Court's

20

precedence, don't rise to a matter of public concern.

21

However, if you had an organization

22

petitioning a ­­ a police district for wages across the

23

board for police officers, then that is a matter of

24

public concern and would violate the First ­­

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I really don't understand

3

Or does it have to be the whole police force?

4

When ­­ when you ­­ so what if it's 10 policemen

The line would be, once you

5

have the collective, it would be start to become a

6

matter of public concern.

7

concern test.

8
9

It'd be the public

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It seems to me it's always

a matter of public concern, whether you're going to

10

raise the salaries of policemen, whether it's an

11

individual policeman asking for that or ­­ or a ­­ a

12

combination of policemen or a union.

13

matter of public concern, isn't it?

14
15
16
17
18

MR. MESSENGER:

It's always a

Then if it is, then I submit

that it's unconstitutional for ­­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

To not ­­ not give

this guy an appointment the 12th time.
MR. MESSENGER:

No.

The police just ­­

19

chief can certainly shut his door, but what would be

20

unconstitutional is to force ­­

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, how can he shut his

22

door if ­­ he has a right to petition, a constitutional

23

right to petition for the redress of grievances?

24

grievance is he's not being paid enough.

25

MR. MESSENGER:

His

But in that case, under our

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

public concern test, which goes within the Pickering

2

line, that that individual grievance would not rise to a

3

First Amendment petition.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But it's the same grievance

5

if the union had presented it.

6

the salaries for policemen are not high enough.

7

MR. MESSENGER:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

The ­­ the grievance is

But the ­­

his salary to be raised.

He's not asking for just

10

all the cops to be raised.

11

MR. MESSENGER:

He wants salaries of all ­­

Well, two points.

The first

12

is the scale is what differentiates.

13

a union petitioning a State for Medicaid rates that are

14

paid for 20,000­some care providers, and so the scale of

15

it is what makes it a matter of public concern or a

16

matter of lobbying, as opposed to ­­

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So here, you have

But what ­­ what you're

18

objecting to, to the extent that you're not objecting to

19

the entire system of collective bargaining, you're

20

objecting ­­ you're saying an individual employee can

21

say, I don't feel like supporting a union that makes a

22

certain kind of argument about wages or about benefits.

23

So, just to carry on with Justice Scalia's

24

example, the subject matter is the exact same in the two

25

contexts, whether it's an individual employee or whether

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it's a union, and in both contexts, the ­­ the ultimate

2

sanction is the same, right?

3

pay too much, he could get fired.

4

support a union that is negotiating about pay, he can

5

lose his job.

6
7

Somebody grouses about his
Somebody refuses to

So it's ­­ it's really identical across the
two situations.

8

MR. MESSENGER:

Well, I'd say ­­

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Same subject matter, same

10
11

sanction.

What's the difference?

MR. MESSENGER:

There's two ­­ two

12

differences.

13

talking about a union collectively petitioning a school

14

district or in the States ­­

15

One, again, is the scale.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

When you're

But you're not objecting, I

16

think, to the union as a whole.

17

to is an individual employee having to support that

18

activity.

19

individual employee.

20

MR. MESSENGER:

What you're objecting

The scale is no different.

It's an

Yes, the ­­ it's an

21

individual employee being forced to support that

22

expressive activity.

23

expressive activity are they being forced to support?

24
25

So the question becomes:

What

And when you're speaking of changing an
entire government program, for example, Medicaid rates

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

across the board, that is a matter of public concern.

2

That is a matter of lobbying or political concerns.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But that's exactly what the

4

individual employee in Justice Scalia's hypothetical is

5

arguing for.

6

the board.

7

just for him.

8
9

He wants wage rates to be changed across
He knows they're not going to be changed
He wants higher wage rates.

MR. MESSENGER:

But, again, under this

Court's private ­­ under the public concern test, an

10

individual simply speaking to that usually does not rise

11

to a matter of public concern.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, Mr. Messenger, I'm

13

confused by this whole line of argumentation.

14

think there was any issue in this case about the right

15

of the plaintiffs or any of the other affected workers

16

to say whatever they want on their own.

17

not prohibited from doing that, are they?

I didn't

That ­­ they're

18

MR. MESSENGER:

No, they're not.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

So there isn't any issue

20

about that in the case.

21

can try to ­­ to meet with anybody they want as many

22

times as they want.

23

perfect right to say:

24

meet with you for the fifth time or for the first time.

25

I thought the issue ­­ and they

I suppose that ­­ that person has a
Enough is enough; I don't want to

I thought the issue was whether they could

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

be required to pay for somebody else to go and speak and

2

possibly say things that they disagree with.

3

MR. MESSENGER:

Yes, exactly, that they are

4

being forced to support an organization, here, the SEIU,

5

to speak or petition the State over its Medicaid rates.

6

So the distinction is ­­

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

down.

9

with a union qua union.

So let's break this

You're not arguing that there's something wrong
Is there anything wrong with

10

the State saying, we're not going to negotiate with any

11

employee who's not a member of the union?

12

MR. MESSENGER:

Yes, under ­­ I'm sorry.

13

There is ­­ Your Honor, there is not a problem with that

14

because my whole ­­

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

Is there a

16

problem for the State to say ­­ the union, to organize,

17

has a certain amount of costs.

18

representation laws, could the State say, this is what

19

we're going to pay police officers, $100, but we're

20

going to pay union members $110 to reimburse them for the

21

cost of negotiation.

22

MR. MESSENGER:

So putting aside fair

Would that be okay?
Yes.

Under Knight, the

23

State can choose who it bargains with, and if it chooses

24

to set different rates for union and ­­ union and

25

non­union, it could, as you said, notwithstanding

11
Alderson Reporting Company

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So there's no problem

3

here with the representation.

Your problem is with the

4

fair share?

5

MR. MESSENGER:

Yes, forcing the individuals

6

to support the union for the purpose of petitioning the

7

State over here the Medicaid rates for homecare.

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Are there any ­­ you

suggest, in response to my colleague's question, that

10

they could ­­ the State could pay healthcare providers

11

different rates.

12

We're talking about Medicaid reimbursement.

Is there ­­ are there any limitations?

13

MR. MESSENGER:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.
Are there any

15

limitations that would prevent differential rates of

16

pay, reimbursement, under Medicaid for the same

17

services?

18

MR. MESSENGER:

There may be statutory.

I

19

know that most Medicaid programs are ­­ across the board

20

set rates.

21

differential act or degree, it could be considered a

22

penalty for the individual exercising their rights.

23

But also, constitutionally, if there was a

25

fixed rate established across the board.

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Messenger, just to

2

clarify what was the purpose of my earlier line of

3

questioning, it was simply to show that, if you have a

4

case, it doesn't rest on the right to petition the

5

government for redress of grievances.

6

It ­­ it rests on the First Amendment.

7

You ­­ you say that there is being ­­ your ­­ your

8

people are being required to support speech that they

9

don't agree with.

10

MR. MESSENGER:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, Your Honor.
Now, that is ­­ you know,

12

that is an arguable position, but I don't ­­ I don't

13

think it's even arguable that the right to petition the

14

government for redress of grievances is ­­ is involved

15

here.

16

MR. MESSENGER:

It's the expression they're

17

being forced to support, Your Honor.

18

as you say, is they're being forced to support

19

expressive activity and that expressive activity ­­

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So the violation,

That's a First Amendment

21

violation, not a violation ­­ not a denial of the right

22

to petition the government.

23

MR. MESSENGER:

Yes, Your Honor.

They're

24

not being denied the right to petition, in the sense

25

that the State is saying they cannot petition.

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Instead,

Official

1
2
3

they're being forced to support petitioning.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Messenger, I'm not sure

that Justice Scalia's answer satisfies his own question.

4

(Laughter.)

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

question?

7

(Laughter.)

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

What ­­ what was the

Because here's the thing:

That, in the workplace, we've given the government a

10

very wide degree of latitude, and there's much that the

11

government can do.

12

people for things that they say in the workplace, not

13

for things that they say as a citizen, but for things

14

that they say in the workplace.

15

lesson of Garcetti and of many, many others of our

16

cases.

17

It can fire people, it can demote

That's the fundamental

So you're saying, well, the government can

18

punish somebody for saying something, but the government

19

in the exact same position cannot compel somebody to say

20

something they disagree with.

21

the basis for that distinction, which it seems to me is

22

just as hard as ­­ as if you were answering under the

23

Petition Clause.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I want to know what's

I want to hear the answer,

too, because, contrary to what Justice Kagan suggests,

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I ­­ I didn't say your First Amendment argument was

2

valid.

3

(Laughter.)

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

Good, okay.
I said at least it was a

comprehensible argument.

7

(Laughter.)

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

Jump in whenever

you'd like.

10

(Laughter.)

11

MR. MESSENGER:

The way in which homecare

12

providers petition the State, I submit, is not an

13

internal proprietary matter that the government has free

14

rein to manage.

15

government acting as proprietor, as you say, the

16

government can tell an employee on work time that you

17

can't engage in certain speech if it interferes with the

18

workplace.

19

And so the distinction between

But the way in which an individual

20

associates with to lobby or petition the State is not an

21

internal proprietary matter.

22

way in which Susan Watts and other homecare providers

23

petition the State is not internal workplace speech.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:
is for private employers.

So for example, here, the

Why isn't it?

I mean, it

There are some private

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

employers who think they're better off with a closed

2

shop, and they just want to deal with one union, and ­­

3

and they require all the people that they hire to become

4

a member of this union and to pay union dues for

5

representational purposes.

6

They do this as private employers because

7

they think it is in their interest as an employer.

8

can't the government have the same interest?

9

MR. MESSENGER:

Why

Because when the government

10

is involved, the First Amendment interests are much

11

heightened because you're dealing with attempting to

12

influence government policy.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

All right.

But ­­ but

14

don't tell me that there's no employer interest.

15

is an employer interest.

16

not ­­ it is not considerable enough, right?

MR. MESSENGER:

It's ­­ Your Honor, it's the

other First Amendment rights is not exculpatory.

So

10

it's the ­­ it's the compulsion to support the SEIU's

positions in petitioning the State.

12

Amendment violation.

13

And the fact that ­­

fact that you're entitled to speak against abortion

18

MR. MESSENGER:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20
21

Exactly, Your Honor.
That's the argument you're

making.
MR. MESSENGER:

Yes.

And actually, I submit

22

that the fact that providers do remain free to petition

23

the State only shows that the so­called "labor peace"

24

interest hasn't been done here by Illinois because the

25

interest there is to avoid competing demands from

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

various providers.
Here, the fact that each provider does, in

3

fact, remain free to petition the State through

4

organizations other than the SEIU shows that the State

5

has not achieved any sort of labor peace, as the State

6

could potentially achieve within its workplace by ­­

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

8

suppose there could be labor peace if the Respondents

15

16

interest ­­ isn't there labor peace if one union

17

represents these healthcare providers and makes and

18

negotiates a contract with the government?

19

MR. MESSENGER:

No, I submit that the labor

20

peace interest isn't valid here because, in dealing with

21

the Medicaid program, the State doesn't have an interest

22

in avoiding competing demands from rival groups

23

regarding its policies on that; That is, democratic ­­

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, why doesn't it?

It ­­ it gets the demand from the union, it recognizes

forward with the policy.

address that problem, training, gloves that they need

Mr. Smith, the first word in your brief is "Medicaid."

And I'd like to hear what your

MR. SMITH:

My answer, Your Honor, would be

10

that the fact that it is a public employee union,

11

representing public employees, means that, in one sense,

12

everything that is being negotiated could be viewed as a

13

greater matter of public concern.

That

MR. SMITH:

It would be a subject if the

State chose to let ­­ let it become a subject.

3

4

of collective bargaining and what can't.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

6

spends a lot of money trying to bargain on that issue,

7

that's ­­ that's a chargeable expense, is it not?

MR. SMITH:

If the State has chosen to make

it part of the contract that can be negotiated, yes.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

Now, what do you

11

say to the young employee who is not very much concerned

12

at this point about pensions, but realizes there's a

13

certain pot of money, and it's either going to go for

14

pensions, or it's going to go for salary at the present

15

time.

16

So that employee who's not a member of the

person's interest.

21

MR. SMITH:

But you say that person is a free

That ­­ that

22

person, if it's not paying their share of that, then you

4

beneficial arrangements are made that satisfy the

5

priorities of everybody here, the workers and the State

6

and, indeed, the clients that they serve.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose the young person

8

thinks that the State is squandering his heritage on

9

unnecessary and excessive payments for benefits and

10

wages.

Is that not a political belief of the highest

11

order?

And ­­ you know, we talk about free riders,

12

which is an epithetical phrase.

13

Maybe the objecting employee would say that

14

the union is a speech distorter; it is taking views that

15

are not his and making them mandatory subject to

16

bargaining and charging him for it.

17

MR. SMITH:

What's missing, I think, in this

18

conversation, Your Honor, is that all of these burdens

19

on people's associational rights or free speech rights

20

or whatever you want to call them arises only because

21

somebody has chosen to come take this job working for

22

the State on the terms the State offers.

23

13

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

14
15
16
17

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The line drawn in Abood is sound.

It has

18

the force of stare decisis behind it, it is completely

19

consistent with this Court's First Amendment

20

jurisprudence, and it requires affirmance.

21

If I could, I'd like to turn to the

22

questions that Justice Kennedy has raised because I do

23

think it gets to the key issue in the case.

24

key point ­­ the key takeaway in this case is that the

25

context we are dealing with here is the government as

47
Alderson Reporting Company

I think the

Official

1

proprietor and manager of its own operations.

2

Court's case law has said, over and over again, that in

3

that context, two things follow.

4

And this

First, the government's interest in the

5

effective and efficient carrying out of its own

6

operations is entitled to very substantial weight, more

7

substantial weight than it would get if you were looking

8

at the government as a sovereign regulating the

9

citizenry.

10

And second, yes, Justice Kennedy, indeed, as

11

Your Honors' opinion in Garcetti and Your Honors'

12

opinion in Borough of Duryea recognized both times, the

13

employees' First Amendment interests are diminished to

14

the extent that the government has more latitude when

15

the government can show that the obligation it is

16

imposing is in furtherance of the government's

17

legitimate interests as manager of its own operations.

18
19
20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

General Verrilli,

does Medicaid have anything to do with this case?
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes.

Let me do my best

21

to try to clear that up, Mr. Chief Justice.

22

to give you the best answer I can to your question.

23

Remember, Medicaid, of course, is a joint Federal/State

24

program.

25

State provides funds.

I'm going

The Federal government provides funds; the

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Here, we're operating within a waiver

2

program in which the State is given considerable

3

latitude to set wages and set rates, so long as it is

4

saving money as compared to the institutionalization of

5

this population.

6

My understanding is that HHS will review

7

wage rates set to make sure that they meet very general

8

parameters.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If the ­­ if the

2

union wants to talk about Medicaid rates with the State

3

because they would get a higher wage or could get a

4

higher wage if Medicaid reimbursement was higher, is

5

that within the ­­ their functioning as a union rather

6

than a political group?

7

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Not as I understand it.

8

I think applying the line of Lehnert, that that would be

9

on the impermissible side of the line.

That would be

10

effectively seeking to change public policy by changing

11

what the legislature or the ­­

wants to say, Look, the only way our people are going to

Alderson Reporting Company

1

bargaining with a fair share, as Justice Scalia

2

mentioned earlier, in a way that private employers

3

routinely do.

4

I mean, I do think that's the fundamental

5

point of Abood, that private ­­ that the government as

6

employer, as manager of its own operations, ought to be

7

able to make the same kind of choice that private

8

employers make when they think it advances their

9

interests in efficiency and sound operations.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

If the plaintiffs in this

11

case worked in a unionized ­­ excuse me ­­ in a unionized

12

Federal workplace, would they be assessed a mandatory

13

agency fee?

14

GENERAL VERRILLI:

No, they would not,

15

Justice Alito, and we're not ­­ we're not here making an

16

argument that, as a matter of policy, States ought to

17

adopt fair share or not.

18

is the principle of First Amendment law that's at stake.

19

The thing that matters to us

JUSTICE ALITO:

So the Federal government

20

doesn't think that it needs to assess a mandatory agency

21

fee from, let's say, the ­­ the employees in the Border

22

Patrol, in order to make sure that the Border Patrol has

23

high morale, sufficient salary, sufficient benefits, it

24

can do without the agency fee in that situation?

25

GENERAL VERRILLI:

It hasn't, but the key

51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

point for us, the point of vital importance for the

2

United States here, is that the Court continue to

3

recognize the context ­­ the First Amendment context of

4

the government as manager of its own operations.

5

whatever choice the United States has made, many States

6

have made different choices in their role as manager of

7

their own operations.

8
9

And

And under the Court's established case law,
which Abood, I think, is a quite good example of, the

10

principle that, when the government is acting to further

11

its operations as manager, they get substantial

12

latitude.

13

They can't use that authority to ­­ they can't leverage

14

that authority to affect the way citizens interact as

15

citizens ­­

16

Now, there's a limit on that, of course.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, one can be

17

skeptical about whether ­­ when States do this, they are

18

doing it because it's more ­­ more efficient as an

19

employer because some States have tried to force private

20

employers to have a closed shop, haven't they?

21

GENERAL VERRILLI:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I think ­­
And there's no ­­ you know,

23

no State government interest in it.

24

interest in unions.

25

GENERAL VERRILLI:

There's just State

Yes, but, here, we

argue ­­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

And unions getting a lot of

3

money from people who don't belong in the unions.

4

one can be skeptical about whether this is really what's

5

going on, that the State really thinks it's going to be

6

a lot easier if it has a closed shop.

7

GENERAL VERRILLI:

So

I guess what I would say

8

about that, Justice Scalia, is that one could speculate

9

about motives of States like Illinois, one could

10

speculate about motives of the right­to­work States, but

11

I would suggest that, under our Federal system, that

12

States get to make those kinds of policy choices.

13

And Illinois has made a policy choice, as

14

many private employers have, that using collective

15

bargaining ­­ and it is, I want to stress here, very

16

narrowly tailored collective bargaining.

17

18

By law, it can

Do you think that the

20

specific factual background of what occurred here

21

provides a basis for skepticism about Illinois' reason

22

for adopting this?

23

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I don't think so.

When

24

the legislation was enacted, it was enacted with a very

25

large bipartisan margin, and I just don't think it would

53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

be appropriate, in the context of the government as

2

manager of its own operations, to look behind and try to

3

consider motive.

4

This is a choice that many ­­

I thought the situation was

6

7

contribution from the union and virtually, as soon as he

8

got into office, he took out his pen and signed an

9

executive order that had the effect of putting ­­ what

before the Court is the constitutionality of the statute

17

GENERAL VERRILLI:

And they ought to have

6

case law.

7

That's our position with respect to that.

If I could make a point that I think is an

8

important point about the free rider rationale under

9

Abood.

There's been some suggestion that the point of

10

the free rider rationale is to ­­ is to force the

dissenters ­­ the nonunion members to pay up.

12

I don't think that's the right way to

13

understand the free rider point.

14

has imposed a duty of fair representation, then

15

everybody's got an incentive to free ride, whether

16

you're a union supporter or not, because, by operation

17

of law, you're going to get the benefits.

18

That, once the State

It's just a classic logic of collective

19

action problem, and so the ­­ the fair share requirement

20

really is content neutral, in that it's ­­ it's designed

21

to ensure that the union has the funds it needs to carry

22

out the responsibilities that the State wants it to

23

carry out and that that could be jeopardized by

24

supporters, as well as dissidents, deciding that they ­­

2

of fair representation even if they didn't.

3

Now, with respect to the question of ­­ of

whether Abood should be overruled, I would suggest to

the Court that it's got a very powerful stare decisis

effect behind it.

Abood's not exactly an outlier.

It was reaffirmed

As Justice Breyer indicated, there is very

10

substantial reliance and contractual reliance throughout

11

the country on the constitutionality of Abood.

12

And as I ­­ I said, I think the most

13

important point here is that the line the Court drew in

14

Abood and the line that has stood for 40 years is

15

entirely consistent with the Court's First Amendment

16

jurisprudence in the context of government as employer,

17

not as regulator of sovereign.

18

Of course, if the government was acting as

19

sovereign regulating the citizenry, an obligation of

20

this kind would trigger the most exacting scrutiny.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is it true that, from ­­

22

from the beginning, there have been members of this

23

Court who have questioned whether there is any principle

24

basis for distinguishing between the chargeable and the

25

nonchargeable expenses and also have questioned whether

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM L. MESSENGER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
JUSTICE BREYER:

I suspect you're going to

19

answer my question, so I want to focus it ­­ and I'm

20

sorry to do this, but I think it's important.

21

All right.

I suspect you cannot answer my

22

question about reliance without accepting one of the

23

following three propositions:

24

employee, government employees have no right to

25

organize.

First, unlike every other

57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Or, second, they have a right to organize,

2

but they cannot bargain about wages, working conditions

3

and hours, unlike any other, that's the same as the

4

first.

5

Or, third, the courts of the United States

6

are going to fashion, using the First Amendment as their

7

weapon, a new special labor law for government

8

employees.

9

on that in the 1930s, where courts tried to do something

10
11
12
13

And I'd remind you we have some experience

analogous.
All right.

Now, answer my question about

reliance.
MR. MESSENGER:

I believe there ­­ the

14

reliance interests here are insignificant if Abood is

15

overruled because the result will simply be that

16

employees cannot be forced to support union

17

representation.

18

The State ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why would anybody join

19

a union under those circumstances or pay enough to

20

support the union efforts?

21

MR. MESSENGER:

Because the union, first,

22

would control their terms of their economic conditions

23

of employment and have control of their relations with

24

their employer, which creates a strong incentive for an

25

employee to want to be on good terms with that union.

17

any way to decide who's doing it just to save money and

18

who's doing it on principle?

19

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Not that I'm aware of.
So ­­ so you're essentially

21

destroying not just the ­­ not just the ­­ the ­­ closed

25

MR. MESSENGER:

Well, two points.

59

First,

exclusive representation, I submit, is not an impediment

2

to gaining membership.

3

voluntary support for it.

4

to ask people to support it, if it has power over their

5

terms of employment.

It helps the union gain
It's much easier for a union

6

So the free rider problem with an exclusive

7

representative is actually less than it would be if the

8

union was a voluntary organization, not as ­­ it doesn't

9

make it worse.

I mean, there's a reason that unions

10

seek exclusive representation in the Federal government,

11

in the Postal Service, and the nation's 24 right­to­work

12

States because it's ­­

Do you doubt that these were core central

19

provisions in the making of these contracts; that if

20

these kinds of provisions were prohibited, the ­­ the

21

agreements would look fundamentally different in many

22

ways?

23

MR. MESSENGER:

The main difference is just

24

the compulsory unionism clause in the agreement would be

25

gone.

But otherwise, the agreements would be the same.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You think that the union

2

would ­­ would not ask for anything, would not have

3

different ­­ you know, would not ask for different

4

mechanisms in order to support its own activity?

5

The unions go into these contracts with the

6

understanding that this is what's going to enable them

7

to at once satisfy their universal obligation to

8

employees to fairly represent them and, also, get the

9

funds they need for administrative and other expenses.

10

MR. MESSENGER:

I would submit that, with

11

compelled fees off the table, the union would actually

12

have more leverage to get things for employees because

13

the compelled fees clause is leveraged for the employer

14

because that's something the employer ­­ or the union

15

wants and that the employer doesn't care if it gives it

16

away because, ultimately, that's money out of somebody

17

else's pocket.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So you think that if we just

19

strike these provisions, in other words, the ­­ the

20

contracts would have been negotiated in exactly the same

21

way, nothing else would have changed?

fees.
