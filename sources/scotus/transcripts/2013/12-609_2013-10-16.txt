CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

General Schmidt.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEREK SCHMIDT

7

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SCHMIDT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Once the Respondent made the trial decision

11

to make his mental status an issue and then supported

12

his argument by introducing, as evidence, the testimony

13

of a mental health expert who had examined the

14

defendant, he no longer could properly claim the

15

protection of the Fifth Amendment to avoid like kind

16

rebuttal by another court­appointed expert.

17

When the Kansas Supreme Court allowed the

18

Respondent to do just that, it committed constitutional

19

error and should be reversed for three reasons.

20

this Court's cases point to the opposite conclusion.

21

Second, allowing this mental for mental expert rebuttal

22

is consistent with this Court's precedent with the

23

purposes of the Fifth Amendment, and it is fair.

First,

24

And third, a holding that is consistent with

25

the Kansas Supreme Court's rule would have the effect of

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

undermining the truth­seeking function of the trial by

2

excluding relevant evidence from the jury, especially in

3

the mental health context where the jury has to make an

4

assessment based upon ­­

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, that would ­­

6

that would be true, the last would be true, even if the

7

defendant had not sought to introduce expert evidence of

8

his own, right?

9

MR. SCHMIDT:

It ­­ that would be true, Your

10

Honor.

11

is that broad.

12

allows that, once the defendant has opened the door by

13

putting his own expert on, the government may respond in

14

kind.

15

We're not asking for a rule that that's ­­ that
We're asking for a rule of parity that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but just ­­ I have

16

the same concern as Justice Scalia.

17

your case easier, but it seems to me that the defendant

18

puts his mental capacity in issue and then testifies

19

himself, but with no expert, the State can still call

20

its own expert so far as the ­­ so far as the Federal

21

constitution is concerned.

22

rules about it.

23

MR. SCHMIDT:

I mean, that makes

There might be some Kansas

Your Honor, that may well be

24

true, and the language of this Court's precedence

25

through Smith and Buchanan, for example, suggests that

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the rule may be broader than the minimum that we're

2

asking for today.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, the issue is not

4

whether the State can call its own expert.

5

whether the State can compel him to speak to its

6

expert ­­

7

MR. SCHMIDT:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9
10

The issue is

Yes, Your Honor.
­­ without which the expert

can testify, right?
MR. SCHMIDT:

Yes, Your Honor.

The ­­ the

11

Fifth Amendment, of course, is implicated when we're

12

talking about a mental health expert who has conducted

13

an examination of the defendant and the Respondent.

14

That's what we believe is appropriate here, in terms of

15

the parity rule.

16

who has done so, the government may respond in kind.

Once the defendant puts on his expert,

17

JUSTICE GINSBERG:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

General ­­ general ­­
If I could just make ­­ it

19

seems to me that it's not necessary to make our decision

20

depend on whether or not another expert has been called.

21

That makes your case easier.

22

write opinions, we take the easiest route.

And sometimes, when we

23

But I take it, under your theory, even if

24

the defendant had not called his own expert, we would

25

still have the same issue before the Court, and you

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would take the position that a prosecution expert can

2

testify.

3

statement, that's ­­ that's the second point.

4

Now, whether or not he can use the previous

MR. SCHMIDT:

And, Your Honor, the ­­ the

5

hypothetical Your Honor posits is closely related to the

6

second question Kansas presented, which was not granted

7

in this case, which would be the impeachment use once

8

the defendant himself has testified.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But he ­­ the defendant

10

would have to introduce the issue of his mental state,

11

either by his own testimony or an expert, but there's an

12

oddity about this case.

13

Do I understand correctly, General Schmidt,

14

that, if there had never been a Federal proceeding, if

15

this case had proceeded from start to finish in the

16

Kansas courts, there would have been no Welner evidence,

17

there would have been no prosecution expert, because it

18

wouldn't have been allowed under Kansas's own rules?

19

MR. SCHMIDT:

Your Honor, Kansas law makes

20

the distinction between voluntary intoxication as a

21

defense and mental disease or defect as a defense.

22

it does provide a mechanism under the mental disease

23

pleadings for the obtaining of a court­ordered mental

24

evaluation, not under the other.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And

This ­­ this case was

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

voluntary intoxication and ­­ and under Kansas

2

procedure, the ­­ the prosecution could not have called

3

a witness absent insanity or a mental disease; is that

4

right?

5

MR. SCHMIDT:

Justice Ginsburg, it is

6

correct that Kansas could not have called a witness

7

under a voluntary intoxication defense ­­ could not have

8

obtained a court­ordered mental evaluation.

9

correct.

10

That is

The reason I didn't merely say yes is we do

11

have some disagreement with the other side that would be

12

dealt with in the courts below as to whether this truly

13

was a voluntary intoxication defense, since the other

14

side's expert did put the long­term effects on the

15

defendant's mental capacity into issue based on his

16

methamphetamine use.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

General Schmidt, am I wrong

18

to think that the issue in this case is whether there

19

was compulsion at the time when the statement was made

20

to the ­­ the court­ordered expert?

21

MR. SCHMIDT:

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Justice Alito ­­
That's the issue.

It's

23

not ­­ it wouldn't be a question of whether there was a

24

violation of the Fifth Amendment privilege at the time

25

when the statements were later introduced in the Kansas

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

trial.
Isn't it very well settled in this Court's

3

precedents that the introduction of statements

4

obtained ­­ that the introduction of statements at a

5

trial is not ­­ does not implicate the Fifth Amendment

6

privilege?

7

MR. SCHMIDT:

Well, Your Honor, the ­­ the

8

compulsion question is a threshold question.

9

extent this Court has recognized, for example, in cases

10

like Ventris, that there are truly compelled statements

11

in a Portash or Mincey sort of circumstance, that

12

threshold issue would resolve it.

13

This is not that case.

And to the

In fact, any

14

compulsion that might be involved here is much closer to

15

what happens when a defendant makes a trial decision to

16

offer himself as a witness and go on the stand, and

17

then, as a matter of operation of law, must subject

18

himself to cross­examination.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that's the issue, as I

20

see it, but maybe I'm wrong ­­ correct me if I'm wrong,

21

and maybe Mr. Katyal will ­­ that the issue is whether

22

there was unconstitutional compulsion at the time when

23

the statements were obtained.

24

well settled that if there ­­ there wasn't compulsion at

25

that time, then the later introduction of the statements

But I thought it was very

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

into the ­­ into evidence at the trial does not

2

implicate the privilege against self­incrimination.

3

MR. SCHMIDT:

That would certainly be true,

4

Justice Alito, absolutely.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

So what happened in ­­ in

6

State court really is ­­ is irrelevant to this.

7

is ­­ everything that ­­ everything important here was

8

done under Rule 12.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal

9

Procedure and that's ­­ and that's the issue.

10

MR. SCHMIDT:

This

If the compulsion test settles

11

the matter, Justice Alito, yes, that is correct.

12

if it doesn't settle the matter, we think there was then

13

subsequently a waiver at the time the evidence was

14

introduced in the State's trial.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Even

But ­­ but why doesn't it

16

settle the matter as a ­­ as you understand the case

17

that's being presented ­­ as a constitutional matter?

18

Sure.

19

I'm not going to hear this, this ­­ this is a State

20

rule, but insofar as the ­­ the Federal constitution is

21

concerned, why doesn't that settle it?

22

Kansas may have some rules, maybe the judges say

MR. SCHMIDT:

Your Honor, I think it can.

23

There is some dispute between the parties on whether

24

there is a sort of category of compulsion, called

25

something else perhaps, which doesn't rise to the

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Portash­Mincey constitutional bar standard.

2

For example, the Respondent has argued that,

3

although this may not be like Portash and Mincey, there

4

is still, nonetheless, some inappropriate burden upon

5

the choice that was made and that that is somehow

6

constitutionally suspect.

7

concede the ground that, even if ­­ and I agree with

8

you ­­ there was not constitutionally barred compulsion

9

here, still, there is a way for Kansas to prevail in the

10
11

So I'm merely trying not to

case.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

But sort of coming back to

12

Justice Ginsburg's question, the Kansas Supreme Court

13

held that the introduction of ­­ of the allegedly

14

compelled testimony given to the ­­ to the psychiatrist

15

violated the Federal Constitution.

16

why didn't the Kansas Supreme Court simply hold that

17

there was no ­­ no right on the part of the prosecution

18

to obtain that rebuttal evidence or to introduce it

19

since this was a case of voluntary intoxication?

20

But why didn't ­­

You ­­ you tell me that Kansas does not

21

allow this just for voluntary intoxication, and that

22

was ­­ that was the defense he was raising, right?

23

MR. SCHMIDT:

Your Honor, I don't know why

24

the Kansas Supreme Court chose to settle this by

25

interpreting the Fifth Amendment in a manner that we

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

believe is incorrect, but nonetheless, that's what they

2

did.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's what they did.

So

4

when ­­ when we send it back, is it still open to them

5

to decide that, under Kansas law, the testimony was not

6

introducible?

7

MR. SCHMIDT:

Your Honor, I suspect that, if

8

this case is remanded, there will be a variety of other

9

issues presented to the Kansas court, and it will have

10
11

to determine how to resolve them.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

One issue is whether the

12

expert, the government's expert, went beyond the scope

13

of the direct, the experts for the defendant.

14

open ­­ that would be an open issue because I think

15

Rule ­­ the Federal Rule 12.2 is very clear that the

16

rebuttal testimony cannot exceed the scope of the

17

defense expert's testimony.

18

MR. SCHMIDT:

That's an

Justice Ginsburg, it may well

19

be likely that, upon remand, the scope issue would come

20

before the Kansas court to be resolved under principles

21

of Kansas evidentiary law.

22

while it's been argued at some length by Respondent, we

23

don't think the scope question is necessarily or

24

properly in front of this Court.

25

In this case, of course,

It was a threshold determination made by the

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Kansas court that the Fifth Amendment keeps our rebuttal

2

witness off the stand at all, and we have to get past

3

that in order to get to related questions.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that is, as you say, a

5

question of ­­ of Kansas law, so it would be odd for us

6

to resolve that anyway.

7

MR. SCHMIDT:

Well, Your Honor, I think that

8

is a question of Fifth Amendment law.

9

Supreme Court interpreted the Fifth Amendment as

10
11

The Kansas

creating a bar upon Dr. Welner's testimony.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm saying the question of

12

whether the ­­ the cross­examination went beyond the

13

scope of the direct and whether that invalidated it,

14

that wouldn't be resolved under the Federal Rules of

15

Civil Procedure, but rather under Kansas law, right?

16

MR. SCHMIDT:

Your Honor, I believe that is

17

correct.

18

recognized, in the Fifth Amendment context, that there

19

are outer constitutional bounds with respect to scope,

20

for example, the relevancy statute you recognized in

21

both Brown and Magatha.

22

As a practical matter, this Court has

But those are not implicated here.

And as a

23

practical matter, the sorts of allegations that

24

Respondent is now making, although they weren't objected

25

to at trial with respect to specific aspects, would be

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

matters resolved under the Kansas Rules of Evidence.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Should we say anything

3

about that?

4

to ­­ that is, the government expert testified to ­­ the

5

defendant was one of those unusual people who was

6

actually exposed to a variety of different people in his

7

life.

8
9

I mean, one of the things he testified

He had people who were criminal types.
There were drug users.

He found himself identifying and

10

looking up to people alternatively described as "bad

11

boys" or “outlaws.” Looking up to them, being impressed

12

and awed by them and in certain circumstances, wanting

13

to outdo them.

14

Well, that doesn't seem to have much to do

15

with the issue that the defendant put into the ­­ wanted

16

to put in, in the Federal court, which was he wanted to

17

ask about his ­­ about his ­­ his words exactly are "a

18

defense of insanity," which can be interpreted broadly,

19

namely, whether he is insane or not.

20

So we both have the government expert saying

21

no, he's not insane, and the government expert going on

22

to give an explanation of why he shot the sheriff. So is

23

that ­­ is that, in your opinion, something we should

24

say that's a serious question, whether that exceeds it,

25

et cetera?

What should we say about it?

13
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. SCHMIDT:

Justice Breyer, if the Court

2

wishes to speak to scope, I think it could reaffirm that

3

the constitutional standard, as it suggested in both

4

Magatha and Brown, is reasonably related or relevant to

5

the ­­ the direct examination.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So your words

7

would be, because they have introduced what we'd say as,

8

the defense has introduced an argument, that even if

9

it's proper for the introduction of the government's

10

expert witnesses under the Fifth Amendment, it still

11

cannot be beyond ­­ go beyond what is ­­ what's your

phrase.

the defense of insanity that the defendant himself

raised, and then that would be an issue for the Kansas

18

court to decide.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY,
FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MS. SAHARSKY:

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
When a defendant puts his mental state at

20

issue through the testimony of an expert who's examined

21

him, the State may rebut that testimony with its own

22

expert who examined the defendant.

23

does not allow a defendant to put on his side of the

24

story and then deprive the prosecution of any meaningful

25

chance to respond.

The Fifth Amendment

And we think the close analogy here

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is the situation where a defendant himself takes the

2

stand.

3

To the extent that the question ­­ the Court

4

has questions about scope of the government's ability to

5

respond, we think that those are answered, like the

6

General said, by the questions about when the defendant

7

takes the stand reasonably related to the subject matter

8

that the defense put on.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Even if ­­ even if

10

the defendant does not submit an expert of his own, but

11

simply puts his mental state in issue?

12

MS. SAHARSKY:

I think that that's a

13

different case.

14

Powell ­­ have addressed an expert­for­expert situation.

15

And the specific rationale there is that this mental

16

health opinion testimony is different in that you really

17

can't have an expert give an opinion without examining

18

the defendant.

19

The Court's cases ­­ Estelle, Buchanan,

If we're talking about the defendant's

20

testimony, you know, he's not qualified to be an expert.

21

He can give factual statements about what happened to

22

him and what was happening at the time of the crime, but

23

he's not giving an expert opinion.

24

seem to be a different question about whether it's

25

really reasonable to have an expert to rebut that

question in this case.

3

The Court just doesn't need to decide that

There's also a second question that the

4

General alluded to, which is, if he makes factual

5

statements during his mental examination, the defendant,

6

and then also gets up on the stand at trial, testifies

7

and says something contrary ­­ you know, whether you

8

could use those for impeachment purposes, the court

didn't grant that question.

MS. SAHARSKY:

That ­­ that was the

5

because the Court ­­

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean ­­ I guess the

7

question is that you say it's a factual difference; it

8

might be a factual difference between compulsion and

9

lack of compulsion.

10

MS. SAHARSKY:

Okay.

And if the Court wants

11

to say that there is sufficient compulsion here in the

12

ordering of the mental state exam, despite the fact that

13

there was the initial choice by the defendant, we would

14

say the defendant's choice at trial to put on his

15

testimony is what makes this ­­ this evidence available

16

to the government to use in rebuttal.

17

So it's fine that Buchanan does not decide

18

the exact facts of this case.

19

holding does not decide this case, but we think it comes

20

pretty darn close because the Court's rationale was

21

whether the defendant opened the door.

22

and again, did the defendant open the door, and if he

23

does, the State needs this evidence to have any

in the decisions in ­­ in Estelle v. Smith and in

It's a different question about trying to rebut or

impeach the defendant's own statements.

It's a parity principle there.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I'm presuming that

5

if a defendant takes the stand and says something

6

completely contrary to what he tells a government

7

psychiatrist, that you would rely on the Brown line of

8

cases, that you could cross­examine him on the contrary

9

statement to the psychiatrist.

10

MS. SAHARSKY:

Again, we think that's the

11

second question presented that the court didn't grant,

12

but there are good arguments for why the defendant, once

13

he opens the door, should not be able to slam it shut.

14

Also, we think this Court's cases, like Ventris, that

15

have to do with the recent cases on impeachment, would

16

go to this.

17

Now, there's a question about whether it's a

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Scott Cheever's words

Mr.

Katyal, if this had

played out entirely in the Federal court, the

17

examination of the defendant was pursuant to Federal

18

Rule 12.2.

20

examination was ordered in the Federal court after the

21

defendant said, I am going to put on a couple of

22

witnesses ­­ expert witnesses, to testify to my mental

23

state.

Your argument seems to be that Rule 12.2

24

Rule 12.2 says, when a defendant does that,

25

then the government has the right to have the defendant

28

that Rule 12.2 is unconstitutional.

So the broad argument that

Court, to try and deal with a policy concern.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there really a huge

3

difference between mental state as an element of the

4

offense and mental state as an affirmative defense?

5

mean, in reality, doesn't ­­ doesn't the mental state

6

argument of the defendant function as an affirmative

7

defense to premeditated murder?

8
9

Government has the burden of proof on mental
state, but it ­­ it operates, as far as a defendant is

10

concerned, if the defendant is able to show this

11

voluntary intoxication, that would be a defense to

12

premeditated murder.

13

I

MR. KATYAL:

No, Your Honor, our brief at

14

page 36 points out that, under Kansas law, it's an

15

element of the offense, they bear the burden of proof.

16

In the Sixth Circuit decision in United States v. Davis,

17

I think, explains that in a circumstance like this ­­

18

like involuntary intoxication, the defendant is not

19

interjecting some new issue into the trial.

20

The defendant is simply rebutting the

21

premeditation argument, which is their burden to prove.

22

And if you accept their argument here, you're

23

essentially saying that the defendant's own words can be

24

used by the State to shoulder the load against him.

25

that is something foreign to the Fifth Amendment.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DEREK SCHMIDT

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. SCHMIDT:

12

I would just like to refocus on what has

14

interpreted ­­ or we believe misinterpreted the Fifth

15

Amendment to say that, once the defendant had put his

16

own expert on the stand to testify in support of his

17

mental health claim after this expert had examined the

18

defendant, the government couldn't respond in kind.

19

it's that bar on our participating in the fact­finding in

20

front of the jury that we are seeking to have overturned

21

here.

22

The Kansas Supreme Court

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

I think what he's saying is

23

that, look, in Simmons, there is a Fourth Amendment

24

problem, and the defendant wants to testify in a Fourth

25

Amendment hearing.

And if he does, the State will take

55

that statement and use it at the trial.

2

So because of the reasons ­­ I'd say the

3

policies underlying the Fourth Amendment, the court

I mean, I think that's, in my looking at

12

them ­­ because I'm trying to see if I got the argument

13

basically right, which is what I wanted to find out, and

14

now, what's the response to that particular argument?

15

MR. SCHMIDT:

I think, Your Honor, the

16

Simmons circumstance is not applicable here, and, in

17

fact, the Court would have to substantially expand

18

Simmons in order to find it to fit these facts.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

You'd have to say then

20

there's difference between the Fifth Amendment and the

21

Fourth Amendment, and that difference would be what?

22

MR. SCHMIDT:

Well, Your Honor, in the

23

Simmons case, what the government sought to do was to

24

take the defendant's unvarnished statements from the

25

prior hearing and to introduce them without the

56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

defendant having put those issues into the fact­finding

2

portion of the trial as affirmative evidence in the

3

government's case­in­chief.

4

more like Smith on its facts, where the court said, even

5

in the circumstances we're confronted with here, on

6

those facts, we can't do it.

7

In that regard, it is much

The court specifically said later, in the

8

Salvucci case, that it hadn't addressed the question in

9

Simmons as to whether or not the government could use

10

that evidence from the suppression hearing for

11

impeachment purposes, which is much more analogous here.

12

So it's an open question, even under

13

Simmons, even if it applied, and the Court would have to

14

extend it in that regard.

15

shouldn't extend Simmons in that regard because, at the

16

end of the day, the other differing ­­ different factor

17

here ­­ and it goes to the line of question that started

18

earlier ­­ is that there is something different, as the

19

Court has repeatedly emphasized, in the nature that ­­

20

the actual nature of use and obtaining of mental health

21

evidence.

22

The Court, I would suggest,

That's the ink that fires.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if ­­ what

23

happens if the defendant is going through this

24

examination, they ask him this, he tells them this,

25

that, and all of a sudden, they ask him a question, he

allowed ­­ allowed to do that?

3

MR. SCHMIDT:

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

I mean, is he

Yes, Your Honor.
Why?

Because it

might incriminate me?

6

MR. SCHMIDT:

In fact, on the record here,

7

the government's expert, Dr. Welner, specifically

8

advised the Respondent, before the examination began,

9

that if at any point he wanted to terminate the

10

examination, he was free to do so.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So I think yes.
That's a little bit

12

different.

13

well, look, you don't get to put your expert in.

14

what if it's just ­­ you know, particular questions?

15

What happens then?

16

MR. SCHMIDT:

I understand terminate, then they'd say,
But

Well, on ­­ on particular

17

questions, I suppose the Respondent could invoke at that

18

time.

19

introduced at trial, there would be a report generated

20

by the expert, and all counsel, including the

21

Respondent's counsel, would have ability to review it

22

and seek some sort of pretrial order to keep out any

23

particularly offensive materials.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm not quite sure I

2

understand why we shouldn't follow the Simmons analogy

3

because, as I understand it, we haven't ruled on the

4

last question of whether you can use the compelled

5

statements as impeachment.

6

the case, most circuits who have addressed the issue,

7

and I think it may be all of them, have said you can

because there's a waiver of your Fourth Amendment right

9

when you take the stand to impeachment.

10

But if we assume that to be

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Don't forget it.

Why don't you try a quick response?

(Laughter.)

MR. SCHMIDT:

17

Justice Sotomayor, I think the ­­ the key

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

18

difference in Simmons and the reason its reasoning

19

shouldn't be applied here is that the distinction we've

20

been drawing from the start of this case is that what we

21

want is a rule of parity.

22

what the defendant himself put in issue in front of the

23

jury, and that's not Simmons.
