CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

this morning in Case 12­1117, Plumhoff v. Rickard.

Mr. Mosley.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL MOSLEY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

MR. MOSLEY:

9

please the Court:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

The Sixth Circuit completely failed to

11

analyze the second prong of a qualified immunity defense

12

in this case, and that is whether the law was clearly

13

established at the time of the incident in question,

14

such that every reasonable officer would know whether or

15

not the action was constitutional or not.

16

the petitioners were not given fair warning that the use

17

of force in this case, if it was prohibited, was

18

prohibited, and they retain immunity, and the Sixth

19

Circuit must be reversed.

20

Therefore,

This is the argument we ­­ we wish to

21

emphasize today relating to the second prong, what was

22

traditionally the second prong before Saucier, of

23

course, the rigid order of battle was changed.

24
25

Had the Sixth Circuit reviewed its own cases
as of 2004, it should have concluded that Petitioners

1

were entitled to qualified immunity.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought it said ­­ did it

4

disagreement or whether this was reasonable or not?

5

they have some such statement?

6

MR. MOSLEY:

Did

They could not conclude that it

7

was reasonable as a matter of law is the statement I

8

recall, Justice Scalia.

9

that's a legal question.

And ­­ and in that regard,

question, but it didn't do so with reference to prior

case law of 2004.

12

Harris from 2007 and said that there was a factual

13

distinction between Scott, and the devil was in the

14

details; and, therefore, it affirmed the district court,

15

which, I submit, made the same mistake because the

16

district court was looking at Smith v. Cupp from the

17

Sixth Circuit, which was a 2005 opinion, to determine

18

whether or not the officers violated clearly established

19

law.

20

If anything, it looked at Scott v.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Would the court, in your

21

view, ever have an occasion to decide whether conduct of

22

this nature violates the Fourth Amendment?

23

you were right about clearly ­­ clearly established,

24

then could this ­­ could the underlying constitutional

25

question ever be, what would be the posture of the case

MR. MOSLEY:

Well, I mean, we've argued, of

3

course, in our briefs, Justice Ginsburg, that it should

4

be decided in this case, although today we're

5

emphasizing the second prong.

6

posture of such a case?

7

that there's factual complexities in this case that make

8

it difficult for the Court to rule whether or not, on

9

the merits, there was a constitutional violation.

10

But what would be the

The United States has suggested

And I'm not ­­ of course, we ­­ we differ

11

with that to the extent that we've argued there was not

12

a constitutional violation.

13

issue of whether the law was clearly established can be

14

resolved relatively easily, I submit that ­­ that in

15

this case, that is the case, and the Court should rule

16

that Petitioners were entitled to qualified immunity.

JUSTICE ALITO:

But as in Pearson where the

The court could say it wasn't reasonably ­­

MR. MOSLEY:

It could do that, couldn't it?
The way I read Pearson, Justice

23

Alito, no.

dictate is that they must proceed to the second prong if

about that.
MR. MOSLEY:

Well, the ­­ below in the Sixth

13

Circuit, the Petitioners were willing to concede any

14

alleged factual disputes, not legal dispute, but factual

15

dispute, in the light most favorable to the Respondent.

16

We're still willing to do that.

17

argument's sake, any alleged disputes should be

18

construed, which is proper under Scott v. Harris, to

determine the ­­ the historical facts in the light most

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And ­­ and how does that

work out here?
MR. MOSLEY:

In this case, I ­­

5

respectfully, I don't think it's very important.

6

think that there are maybe a couple of alleged factual

7

disputes that, even if you assume them in the light most

8

favorable to the Respondent, they do not affect this

9

Court's analysis under the second prong of qualified

I

10

immunity because this was indisputably a dangerous car

11

chase and indisputably the Respondent never gave up

12

before force was used.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You would say that it

14

doesn't really matter whether he bumped the police

15

cruisers when he was finally cornered, whether he tried

16

to back up into one of the officers, that all of that is

17

just excrescences, that it was enough to justify the

18

shooting that he was driving at 100 miles an hour,

19

swerving around the road, endangering human life and

20

would likely continue that if they let him to get away?

21

MR. MOSLEY:

Two responses, Your Honor.

MR. MOSLEY:

of course, argued that it ­­ it defies logic to me for

20

Mr. Rickard to have put Miss Allen in danger and then

22

free from the use of force when he is endangering the

No, Your Honor.

That remains

in the Western District of Tennessee.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

6

MR. MOSLEY:

Oh, it remains.
And the issue there, of course,

7

is under the Fourth Amendment, the "shocks the

8

conscience" standard.

9

But as of 2004 in the Sixth Circuit ­­ go

10

back to what I'm emphasizing here today in the second

11

prong ­­ there wasn't a ­­ a case that suggested that

12

the driver could invoke the passenger's safety as some

13

means to suggest that the force was excessive.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.

I understand that.

15

Although we're going beyond the necessities of the case,

16

is the rule that the passenger can have a "shock of the

17

conscience" test and it's not limited to the Fourth

18

Amendment, even if the driver is?

19

works?

20

MR. MOSLEY:

Is that the way it

Well, it's interesting.

The

21

circuits go various ways.

22

23

Amendment claim of an un ­­ of an unintentional

24

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS
MR. BASH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I think the correct disposition of this case

17

of reckless driving in response to a police pursuit that

18

authorizes the use of deadly force, some level, at a ­­

19

in a high­speed chase.

20

in 2004 in the relevant circuits here that the driving

that the undisputed facts show in this case would have

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Bash, could I go back to

4

Justice Ginsburg's question, because this is an area in

5

which there's no alternative way really to develop legal

6

standards other than by doing it in these kinds of

7

cases.

8

upon case after case after case, we don't make much

9

progress in actually telling police officers where the

So if we only focus on the clearly established

10

line is.

11

here?

12

So how do we do that?

Why shouldn't we do it

When should we do it?
MR. BASH:

I think the general point is

13

correct, and as we say in our brief, it would hinder the

14

development of constitutional law if courts never

15

reached the merits question.

16

Justice, we have an interest in that, because we

17

prosecute State officials for civil rights violations

18

and there's a similar standard of "clearly established"

19

in the criminal context.

And as the Department of

Our only point here is not that courts

21

should never reach the merits in these cases; it's that

this is a particularly bad vehicle, particularly for

24

cases often lets difficult constitutional issues

25

percolate among lower courts.

Mr. Bash, that

question about the development of the underlying law,

about the number of lives at risk and the relatively

23

culpability of people being put at risk.

24

see how the officer's actions are putting an innocent

25

person at risk.

On the one hand, Scott talked

Maybe that plays in.

25
Alderson Reporting Company

And so you can

But on the other

Official

1

hand, as Justice Scalia said, it's a little bit weird as

2

a constitutional rule to say that the suspect put

3

somebody else's life in danger and gets a greater

4

immunity from suit.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It is a little bit weird.

6

But as I understand the way the lower courts have done

7

this is to say that the passenger actually doesn't have

8

a Fourth Amendment claim, so there is a "shock the

9

conscience" test, which is, of course, a very high

10
11

standard.
MR. BASH:

That's true.

And it's only the

12

district court so far that has ruled on the passenger's

13

Fourth Amendment claim here, and she may have an

14

argument on appeal under Brenlan v. California that she

15

was seized.

16

not through the use of force, through just an ordinary

17

stop, pull over everybody in the car, if the passengers

18

feel like they are not free to leave, they are seized as

19

well constitutionally.

20

Brenlan says if you pull over ­­ you know,

We haven't evaluated it on the facts of this

21

case and how that applies to the sort of force used

22

here, but she may have a Fourth Amendment claim, and it

23

may make sense to filter those sorts of concerns about

24

the innocent passenger through her claim rather than

25

giving the suspect who actually put her in danger a

26
Alderson Reporting Company

3

greater immunity from the use of force.
And I think the other question you asked me
about was ­­

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

MR. BASH:

The degree of force.
­­ the degree of force.

And I

6

think that's part of the reasonableness analysis in the

7

sense that officers generally should use only as much

8

force as is necessary to end the threat, and sometimes a

9

lesser degree of force will be sufficient.

But in this

10

case, at least as a matter of what the law was ­­ in

11

this case, the suspect probably would have gotten away

12

before the police could use less force.

I'll end there.

MR. SMITH:

This case is a classic jury question.

several genuine material issues of fact that are

decision based on the protection of innocent people.

stop someone fleeing when you may be endangering the
