ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANGELA L. CAMPBELL,

APPOINTED BY THIS COURT,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MS. CAMPBELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Marcus Burrage is serving a 20-year

12

mandatory minimum sentence for selling heroin that,

13

according to the jury instruction that was given to the

14

jury at the time of the trial, was not the primary cause

15

of the death, but, rather, merely played a part in the

16

death.

17

This lesser standard of contributing

18

causation was neither articulated by Congress within the

19

words of the statute, nor was it generally accepted at

20

the time the statute was passed, as an acceptable

21

version of causation.

22

Congress's selection of the word "results"

23

instead should be interpreted to mean the traditional

24

notions of causation; those of factual cause or but-for

25

cause and proximate cause.

15

liability for.

But if we instead look to the case

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How would you respond to

17

the hypothetical that the government poses on 24 of its

18

brief, that it's the three drops of poison, each

19

defendant puts in one drop, one drop will not do it,

20

three drops will, and none of them would be chargeable

21

because it takes three drops?

22

MS. CAMPBELL:

Well, I would disagree with

23

the premise that they are not chargeable.

24

25

cup could be charged with attempted murder if they were

Each

2

analysis, you -- you do not have but-for causation.

3

Each individual drop of poison was not the but-for

4

causation and so you -- you don't have causation.

5

But under standard causation

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But you would if --

6

if you knew that there were two drops in and you added

7

the third drop after the two drops.

8

MS. CAMPBELL:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

lost sight of this.

Right?

Then -I'm sorry.

I've

Is this each drop is enough or --

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

MS. CAMPBELL:

Three -- three drops.
It takes three.

In the government's -- in the

14

government's hypothetical, each person individually puts

15

in one drop and you need three drops in order to -- to

16

kill the person.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

All right.

Well,

18

there's but-for causation when you are the third person.

19

Your drop caused the death, and the death would not have

20

been caused without your drop.

21
22

MS. CAMPBELL:

That would be correct, that

there would be but-for causation.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But each one is the third

24

person.

25

It seems to me each one is a but-for cause.

I mean, each one of them is the third person.

5
Alderson Reporting Company

And I don't

Official

1

know why you don't say there's but-for causation there.

2

MS. CAMPBELL:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well -As I understand -- as I

4

understood the evidence in this case, the experts

5

testified they could not say that he would not have died

6

but for the cocaine.

7

MS. CAMPBELL:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's -That's quite different from

9

this case where what is put to you is he -- you could

10

say he would not have died but for the drop that each

11

one of them put in.

12
13

MS. CAMPBELL:
And that -- and --

14
15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So why isn't that but-for

causation?

16

MS. CAMPBELL:

17

causation that I think --

18
19

Yes, you could say that.

It's a form of but-for

JUSTICE SCALIA:
of but-for causation.

20

I don't care if it's a form

It's but-for causation.

MS. CAMPBELL:

It -- it can be.

And I think

21

that certain -- that specific hypothetical, while it

22

warrants special consideration by this Court, whether or

23

not in criminal context, we're going to expand the

24

criminal liability to that is not this case, Justice

25

Scalia.

1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I thought the

2

hypothetical was a bit different.

3

takes two drops to kill him.

4

the problem where you don't have but-for causation

5

because you don't know whether you are the extraneous

6

drop or whether you were the drop that actually killed

7

him.

8
9

MS. CAMPBELL:

I thought it only

And that's what creates

Correct.

If there is a

hypothetical that changes it just slightly, you would

10

not have but-for causation in that circumstance, because

11

each individual drop was not the but-for cause.

12

that's more like our hypothetical.

13

And

And, again, with a poison hypothetical,

14

because it's an intentional act by the defendant, you

15

would still have liability, criminal liability for

16

attempt or assault or something along those lines, but

17

you would not have each individual person liable for the

18

actual death.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

But part of your argument is

20

that but-for causation isn't sufficient, right?

21

has to be foreseeable.

22

MS. CAMPBELL:

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

24

MS. CAMPBELL:

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

It also

Correct.
Is that your argument?
That is our argument.
Now, give me an example of a

1

situation where a heroin dealer deals -- sells drugs to

2

somebody, and foresees that the drugs that are sold will

3

cause death?

4

MS. CAMPBELL:

Well, I think you can look to

5

the actual case law.

6

hypotheticals, when the heroin dealer is actually using

7

8

that he is overdosing.

9

circumstances are foreseeable.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

And the government --

Those are very unusual

12

circumstances.

13

somebody is just selling heroin there wouldn't be

14

foreseeable, so the statute wouldn't -- foreseeability;

15

the statute wouldn't apply?

16

In all other circumstances where

MS. CAMPBELL:

No, I disagree with that.

17

Foreseeability could be read into those circumstances

18

where you simply have a heroin dealer that is selling

19

heroin and you would take that foreseeability question,

20

the proximate cause question, and you would charge it to

21

the jury.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think "foreseeability" is

23

the wrong word.

24

we -- we use the word "foreseeability" for Palsgraf.

25

It's a matter of scope of the risk.

I don't think, you know, in tort law

8
Alderson Reporting Company

It may not be

Official

1

foreseeable.

2

cause it, but it's within the scope of the risk.

3

when you sell drugs, you know that one of the things

4

that can happen is that the drugs will produce an

5

overdose.

6
7

And

I'm not sure -- I wouldn't call it
foreseeability.

8
9

It may be an unusual situation that will

I would call it scope of the risk.

MS. CAMPBELL:

Both scope in the risk and

foreseeability are versions of saying proximate cause.

10

And either standard in this circumstance would be better

11

than the contributing cause standard that was given to

12

the jury, because it did not use scope of the risk

13

language.

14

didn't use reasonably probable --

15

It didn't use foreseeability language.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I think this is all

16

being sort of tied up together.

17

foreseeability and proximate cause were the same.

18

It

I always thought

I think the issue doesn't do with either

19

foreseeability, scope of risk, or proximate cause.

20

has to do with what you started with, which is what's

21

the level of factual causation that we want to set.

22

What definition are we going to give for the legal

23

causation standard.

24

but-for?

25

It

And you're saying that it has to be

MS. CAMPBELL:

Our position is -- I agree

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

with you, Justice Sotomayor, that the main issue is this

2

but-for causation issue, that if we are correct that

3

but-for causation should be read into a criminal

4

statute, as we believe it should under these

5

circumstances under this statute, that the appropriate

6

question is whether, but for the heroin, they would have

7

died.

8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

Let's assume

that we are troubled by the examples that have been

10

given.

11

each puts in a drop of blood, either knowing that only

12

one drop is necessary or that all three drops are

13

necessary, we don't want to let that person off because

14

it doesn't seem logical, okay?

15

If two people or three people come together and

What would save your case in it?

Is there a

16

different proximate cause standard but not involving

17

but-for that would still get you what you are looking

18

for?

19
20
21
22
23

MS. CAMPBELL:

Yes, and I don't think you

need to look to causation to get to that answer.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And what do we look to

if we are not looking to causation?
MS. CAMPBELL:

Well, if each individual

24

person in the poison hypothetical is working together

25

and knows about the other people, then you have

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

conspiracy liability.

2

actions of the other people -- of the other person that

3

has put the poison in and you can still --

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And they would be liable for the

Why does it matter if

5

you know that three people have -- three people hate

6

someone and they are acting independently, each one

7

intended to kill the guy and, you know, that the other

8

two joined in was lovely, but we don't know which drop

9

did it.

We don't particularly care, do we?

MS. CAMPBELL:

In that particular

hypothetical then the --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

MS. CAMPBELL:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

There is no conspiracy.

There's no conspiracy.
How can we save this

case if there is no conspiracy?

16

MS. CAMPBELL:

Then you have attempt

17

liability, and those people would still all be

18

criminally liable for attempted murder.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

The Model Penal Code, the

20

Brown Commission, everybody says this is a famous law

21

school hypothetical, I thought you would never find it

22

in reality.

23

two people strike, each strikes a mortal blow

24

independently, and everyone seems to agree there is

25

liability there.

They say certainly there is liability where

And even though no blow -- neither

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

blow is in fact a but-for condition, because in the

2

absence of blow A he would be dead anyway from blow B.

3

All right.

So we start with that, I

thought.

5

don't want to start with that.

Professor Wechsler and Professor Hall and all these

7

people famous in my day were wrong.

9

then how do you win?

10
11

And now starting with that -- you can say I
I think that all

Okay.

That's up to

But if you do take that as a basic assumption,
I think that was the question, and

there may be an answer to that.
MS. CAMPBELL:

Yes, Justice Breyer, there is

12

an answer to that.

13

Professor LaFave, which is the one that you are citing,

14

actually can be answered by the use of the substantial

15

factor language.

16

sufficient causes which act upon an individual causing

17

the death, you have a but-for problem because but for

18

the actor A, B's blow would still kill the person.

19

The hypotheticals that are posed by

Now, when you have two independently

In that limited circumstance, the common law

20

already addresses that and you use the substantial

21

factor language, which we did at the time of the trial,

22

tried to incorporate into our jury instruction, which

23

was rejected by the trial court.

24

to those circumstances where you have two --

1

I mean, I don't follow you.

2

to where you want to be unless "substantial factor"

3

means that it would have been a but-for cause.

4

MS. CAMPBELL:

I don't see how it gets you

That is our position, that

5

substantial factor is appropriate when it would have

6

been a but-for cause.

7

sufficient cause or but-for causes only failing by

8

another independently sufficient cause.

9

You either need independently

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So when you use that

10

language of "substantial factor," what you really mean

11

to point to is independent sufficiency?

12

shoot, either one would have killed the person, but you

13

can't say --

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

16
17

Two people

Right.
-- that either is the but-

for cause because of the fortuity of the second act?
MS. CAMPBELL:

Correct.

That is the

18

traditional reason why you would use the substantial

19

factor instruction.

20
21
22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So you don't mean that to go

any further than independent sufficiency?
MS. CAMPBELL:

We do not mean it to go any

23

further, and I don't believe that the case law or the

24

treatises take it any further.

25

hypothetical --

There is this other

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's a strange terminology

2

for it.

3

terminology if that's what they mean.

4

MS. CAMPBELL:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

I mean, they really ought to get another

We agree.
You can be a substantial

factor without being independently sufficient.

7

MS. CAMPBELL:

You could under the common

8

use of the word "substantial factor," but at least

9

"substantial factor" would have been better language

10

than "contributes to" or "plays a part in" that this

11

jury heard.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

MS. CAMPBELL:

Marginally.
It would at least give us the

14

opportunity to argue that the heroin was not the

15

substantial factor to a jury in a factual question if

16

"substantial factor" does not mean independently

17

sufficient cause.

18

time of the passing of this particular provision,

19

"substantial factor" meant to address the circumstance

20

where you have two independently sufficient causes.

21

But it's our position that at the

So regardless of whether you use

22

"substantial factor" as being independently sufficient

23

cause or some other sort of formulation of the language

24

of "substantial factor," you still have this problem

25

that the jury was not instructed on even substantial

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

factor.

2

that --

They were instructed on contributing cause,

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You do agree that, that

4

an overdose -- there is a foreseeable risk that someone

5

who purchases heroin will overdose, there is a

6

foreseeable risk of that?

7

MS. CAMPBELL:

I concede that in a heroin

8

case, that is a question for the jury, that you would

9

charge foreseeability or proximate cause to the jury in

10

those circumstances.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess here's what the

12

government might say back to you.

13

know, in these drug cases, people often take drugs in

14

combination and then they overdose, and it's really

15

impossible for anybody to be able to say what you are

16

requiring an expert to say.

17

impossible to say it was the heroin, not the cocaine, it

18

was the cocaine and not the heroin, it was both, it was

19

neither.

20

They might say, you

In other words, it's

It's just -- it's all we can talk about is

21

likelihoods.

22

say the fact that he took the heroin made it much more

23

likely that he would die.

24

to be able to show in a case like that, this, and

25

because of that, we -- that's got to be enough.

You know, just as this expert did.

They

And that's all we are going

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MS. CAMPBELL:

And I would agree that that's

2

their argument and that's an argument that should be

3

presented to Congress to amend the statute to

4

incorporate language that addresses that.

5

knows how to address a contributing cause standard.

6

They said it in numerous other statutes that a certain

7

act contributes to a death, that the result is in whole

8

or in part a result of the defendant's action.

9

said it.

10

Congress

They've

They know how to say it and they could say it

again in this statute if they wanted to.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, let's compare what --

12

the situation that Justice Kagan just described with

13

this situation.

14

know, a three-day supply or four-day supply, whatever it

15

is.

16

this much per day.

17

the whole amount and -- and dies as a result of an

18

overdose.

19

The heroin dealer sells a user, I don't

And tells the -- the user, now, you should only use
But the user goes off and injects

Now, why would Congress want to punish that

20

person where the overdose -- where the heroin sold is

21

the but-for cause of death and not the situation where

22

there's the -- the multidrug cocktail?

23

MS. CAMPBELL:

Well, in the absence of

24

language to the contrary, this statute actually says,

25

the use of this substance, the substance sold by the

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

defendant results in a death.

2

And so when we start by looking at the words

3

of the statute, they -- they don't say these common

4

words that you could use to encompass those

5

circumstances.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I understand that.

7

That's a textual argument and maybe the text can be read

8

both ways.

9

Congress want to attach these severe consequences in the

10

Assuming it can be read both ways, why would

overdose case and not in the drug cocktail case?

11

MS. CAMPBELL:

Because Congress would want

12

to target a situation where there has been proof beyond

13

a reasonable doubt that the defendant's actions were the

14

cause of the death.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, for -- for any crime,

16

there are two things.

17

wickedness, and in both cases, the party is equally

18

wicked, but we also punish the consequence.

19

case, the party dies because of that person's act.

20

in the other case, nobody dies just because of that

21

person's act.

22

from that.

23

We punish the intent, the

In one
And

I don't know why you have to run away

It's -- it's common in the criminal law

that -- that two acts that are equally unlawful, equally

I was addressing in Justice -- the justice's

hypothetical was that you can't read congressional

6

intent into the selection of the words within this

7

statute.

8

drug cocktails all equally, they would instead have

9

written the statute to address the cocktail.

Justice Alito's hypothetical, he gives a

of law, is that a violation?

21

MS. CAMPBELL:

No, no, no.

As a matter

It would be if he takes the

22

heroin, and the heroin is the cause of the death, then,

23

yes, it's a but-for cause.

24

should have a proximate cause analysis, which is the

25

juries are in -- in a unique position to determine

We would then add that you

1

whether or not foreseeability is appropriate in that

2

circumstance.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

All right.

Suppose we go

4

back to Justice Alito's example and it's just a two-day

5

supply and there are statistics that 1 percent of heroin

6

users overdose.

7

liability under your foreseeability standard?

8
9

Is that sufficient to establish

MS. CAMPBELL:

Not as a matter of law and

not to the degree that the Solicitor General urges that

10

it's a per se foreseeability.

11

always going to be instructed to the jury in that

12

circumstance.

13

1 percent is sufficient, and the defense can argue

14

1 percent chance is not sufficient and can attack the --

15

the numbers.

16

Foreseeability is still

And they can argue that certainly

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, the question is what

17

the legal standard is.

18

to know does this suffice to impose liability?

19

say well, if you say it is.

20

That's a -- that's a fair question.

Just -- you can't

say, oh, well, it's up to the jury.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. HORWICH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The situation here is very much what Congress had

in mind when it sought to hold drug traffickers

20

responsible for the results of the use of the dangerous

21

substances in which they deal.

22

to speak of a drug as contributing to an overdose.

is no room to argue that a heroin user's overdose death

comes as a surprise.

6

MR. HORWICH:

No, I don't think so,

7

Mr. Chief Justice.

8

the concern that arises with your hypothetical, which

9

doesn't arise on these facts, presents a different issue

And let me explain, because I think

10

than what's in dispute before the Court right now.

11

dispute between the parties is what kinds of -- on the

12

causation in fact side of the case, the dispute is

13

between what kinds of causes can qualify at all.

14

they have to be but-for causes or can a contributing

cause count?

Do

Now, there is a separate principle which is

reflected in jury instructions and reflected in the

important enough or too insubstantial are not properly

stand, and they say:

Did the heroin cause the death?

4

And the experts say:

Really can't say whether the

5

heroin caused the death in the sense that if the -- if

6

he hadn't taken the heroin, he wouldn't have died.

You have somebody who's taken five drugs.

that the heroin made it more likely that he died.

Well, how much more likely did the heroin

make it?

12

likely that death resulted.

Well, the heroin made it 50 percent more

13

Would that be sufficient?

I -- I think probably yes,

the nature of the expert testimony as actually different

the expert testimony in this case, but in general what

23

experts are testifying to when they're testifying to

whether the defendant's drugs played any role at all.

They are not testifying to some uncertainty about

This isn't the question of say, yeah, he bought heroin

2

from two different dealers.

3

4

In that case we totally agree that that sort

5

of uncertainty means no liability.

6

testified to in these cases is that the primary cause of

7

death, which is essentially central nervous system

8

depression that leads to asphyxiating on stomach

9

contents or saliva or something like that, was a process

What the experts

to which a number of substances contributed.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes, and he might have died

12

even without the heroin, because all the other

13

substances might have been perfectly adequate to cause

14

death.

15

played -- even -- you know, even to use your language, I

16

can't tell you whether the heroin contributed.

17

can tell you is a likelihood, a probability that the

18

heroin led to death.

19

So I really can't tell you that the heroin

MR. HORWICH:

All I

Well, the experts here of

20

course did testify specifically that the heroin did

21

contribute to the death.

22

So --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, again, that question

23

of words, the experts were very careful to say:

24

cannot tell you that in the absence of the heroin he

25

wouldn't have died.

"I

heroin, the experts said.

2

is that the heroin made it more likely that he died.

3

MR. HORWICH:

The only thing I can tell you

I guess -- maybe I can respond

4

to that with a perhaps more conventional hypothetical.

5

If you imagine that -- if you imagine that you have

6

three assailants who independently simultaneously set

7

upon the victim and beat him to death, and the victim

8

could have survived any one of them.

9

you might well have testimony from a doctor that says,

In that situation,

10

Well, I can't tell you -- he probably would have died --

11

even I can be sure he would have died from the other two

12

guys.

13

certainly recognize that the -- that each of the

14

assailants is responsible for the victim's death.

15

wouldn't say oh, well, he --

But I think in that -- in that scenario we would

JUSTICE KAGAN:

We

that the heroin was responsible for the death.

21

tell you that in the absence of the heroin he wouldn't

was -- what I can do is to give you essentially a

24

probability that the heroin caused the death.

25

The facts of your case are that the
I can't tell you
I cannot

What I can tell you is that the heroin

And you're saying that's enough, even if the

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

probability is as small as 50 percent.

2

MR. HORWICH:

I don't think -- the experts

3

here did not testify in probability figures in that way.

4

What they testified to was that -- was that the heroin

5

contributed to the set of drugs that were responsible

6

for the actual primary cause of death.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

They said it contributed to

8

the set of drugs, but they didn't say that it

9

contributed to the death.

They had no idea whether it

10

contributed to the death.

All that they were able to

11

say is:

12

probabilities; here are some likelihoods.

13

like the probability language:

14

Using heroin made it more likely that he would die, but

15

we can't say that using heroin killed him.

16

There are five drugs; here are some

MR. HORWICH:

If you don't

Here is the likelihood.

That -- and it is that aspect

17

of the testimony which is why we concede that if you

18

apply a but-for test, that testimony does not establish

19

a but-for test.

20
21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

does it have to make it that he would die?

22

MR. HORWICH:

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

24

MR. HORWICH:

25

Well, how much more likely
50 percent?

It's not a -How about 30 percent?

The relevant question is in a

contributing cause analysis, at least in the first

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

instance, setting aside the substantiality question that

2

the Chief Justice's hypothetical raised, the basic

3

question of the contributing cause analysis is whether

4

the drug in a case like this contributed to the physio

5

-- the internal physiological effects that culminated in

6

the death.

7

And I would make a distinction here, for

8

example.

9

The testimony here does not even establish the marijuana

If you -- consider the marijuana in this case.

10

as being a contributing cause, because the

11

toxicologists -- the toxicologist testifies -- this is

12

at Joint Appendix 193, that the -- "Every drug on this

13

list, with the exception of the constituents of

14

marijuana, have central nervous system depressant

15

effects," and then goes on to explain why it's those

16

effects that are -- that's what's going on in the body

17

that's leading to the death.

18

So again -- so we would agree that if you

19

apply -- that if you insist on a but-for test, then,

20

correct, these sort of probabilities don't get the

21

government even to the jury.

22

That's a directed verdict.

But I want to -- but I would like to point

23

out though -- so I guess what I would like to discuss is

24

why the but-for test is not the right test to be

25

applying here.

Now, can you tell us what, realistically,

can they do in these cases where there is the ingestion

MR. HORWICH:

I -- I can't represent to be

23

informed enough about sort of the range of cases, but I

24

think the testimony in this case is actually informative

25

on that point, because there are a number of

34
Alderson Reporting Company

uncertainties to which the -- the -- the experts

2

testified that show why it is, from -- why it is, from

5

they're having the same effect on the body.

nervous system.

they're all doing the same thing in the same way that --

statute so that you're -- you're liable if you are a

So here we have

And Brown

Okay?

And you can

12

correct that if you want, but I'm beginning to think

13

that probably, at least it should be important in such a

14

situation, and that the word "substantial" better

15

connotes the idea of it being an important factor than

16

the word "contributing," which means picks up all kinds

17

of quite unimportant factors.

18

is, and anything -- I just say that in case you want to

19

respond to that.

20

MR. HORWICH:

That's where my thinking

I do.

I have, I think, two

21

very important things to say in response to that.

22

of them is, as -- as I was sort of suggesting with the

23

Chief Justice, if the dispute is over whether it should

24

be a substantial contributing cause, then I think we're

25

happy to argue that the jury instruction gets in that

here.

Here it's --

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

How

And is the one question

6

is -- is how this all relates to the "beyond a

7

reasonable doubt" instruction in criminal cases?

8

mean, the idea of a test which focuses in the way yours

9

does on probabilities and likelihoods, and then we go

I

10

tell the jury, find beyond a reasonable doubt that this

11

was more likely to have caused the death than anything

12

else, or find beyond a reasonable doubt that this

13

increased the likelihood of death by 50 percent.

14

I mean, that seems a very odd kind of

15

question for a jury to consider, but that's exactly what

16

you would be asking a jury to consider.

17

MR. HORWICH:

I disagree with that.

Because

18

what we're asking the jury to decide is beyond a

19

reasonable doubt, did this drug have the physiological

20

effects that the medical examiners described as being

21

the integral process that resulted in death.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But the statute -- the

23

statute says did it result in death.

24

statute does not say -- does not criminalize a drug that

25

has physiological effects.

It did not -- the

It criminalizes a drug when

it results in death.

2

resulting in death except as -- except by reference to

3

probabilities and likelihoods.

4

And you can't say anything about

MR. HORWICH:

I -- I think that there is

5

going to be testimony about probabilities and

6

likelihoods that will inform the substantiality

7

question, but it's not a question of likelihood that

8

it -- that it contributed to the central nervous system

9

depression that killed the victim here.

That -- that is

unequivocal in the testimony.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If you wanted to

incorporate in the statute your friend's understanding

of but-for cause, what word would you use that would be

better than "results"?

Or solely.

I guess I would

21

refer the Court to the -- the jury instructions that

22

Petitioner proposed here, which are on 238, which say

that, that the -- the proximate cause must be one that

And our point is that the insight in -- in

4

numerous cases we have cited going back, is that that is

5

I could get back, that is the instruction on proximate

cause.

MR. HORWICH:

Well, the way they are

it's sort of built into the proximate cause instruction.

They weren't separated in the way Petitioner did it.

16

there's -- the first part of the second sentence on 238,

factor.

And they seem, I don't know what these words

10

really mean, but it seems they are closer to what you're

11

saying should be the law than you are.

12

MR. HORWICH:

That is a convenient excerpt

13

from the instruction on 238, but the other part of the

14

instruction insists that except for the cause the death

15

would not have occurred.

16

So --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I agree with you the

17

language -- their position now is not that it's enough

18

that it's an important factor.

19

to know your view on this, your opposing counsel

20

contends that the courts and commentators who use the

21

"substantial factor" terminology mean by "a substantial

factor" a factor that would by itself have been

sufficient.

MR. HORWICH:

Rather, and I would like

what he's asking this Court to do, which is reject a

conclusion that nothing and nobody caused the victim to

backwards from the very vague and open language,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Horwich, I just don't

understand what "substantial factor" means in the way

you are using it.

18

because she said "substantial factor" just means

19

independently sufficient.

20

"substantial factor" can mean more than that, but it

21

doesn't have to mean a but-for cause.

22

that is a substantial factor in a death without their

being able to say that it was a but-for cause of the

24

death?

25

I understand what Ms. Campbell said,

But you are saying

How is something

The situations that we're

So in some

So it's not a substantial

6

factor in causing the death, because that assumes that

it actually played a role in causing the death and you

played a role in the victim dying, none of them

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANGELA L. CAMPBELL,

16

APPOINTED BY THIS COURT,

17
18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. CAMPBELL:

It's our position that

19

but-for cause is the first question, and only when you

20

reach a point where there is no but-for cause do you

21

then go on to say, is this one of these circumstances

22

where there is a -- two independently sufficient harms.

23

If no, end of question, which was the motion for

24

judgment of acquittal at the time of trial.

25

no but-for cause.

There was

We made the motion for judgment of

2

inquiry in this particular case.

3

where you make that inquiry.

You don't need to make that
There may be cases

4

Of course, we didn't win, so we had to keep

5

going along, and we asked for a substantial factor test

6

because we thought maybe we could influence the judge to

7

give us a better instruction, like the substantial

8

factor test that the Eighth Circuit had already

9

approved, and he rejected it and gave them a

10

contributing cause instruction, which is clearly not

11

encompassed within the common law standards of

12

causation.

13

But-for cause is substantial factor.
Now, to address the concerns about letting

14

defendants go free, that just simply doesn't play a part

15

in this analysis.

16

these hypotheticals would have some sort of criminal

17

liability, either a lesser included offense.

18

particular defendant, Mr. Burrage, could go to prison

19

for 20 years for the lesser included offense.

death, and enhance the sentence under the -- beyond the

2

guideline range.

3

All of those concerns are already addressed

4

in the criminal law, and we do not need to change the

5

criminal law of causation and relax it to encompass more

6

harms.

7

civil context where you have contributing negligence and

8

shifting of burdens of -- shifting of the costs in

9

having -- your hypothetical, you have different

Because if we aren't willing to do that in a

10

percentages' likelihood of causing the harm.

11

you give 5 percent to the marijuana dealer and

12

10 percent to the oxycodone dealer and 20 percent to the

13

heroin dealer.

14

That's a -- that's a policy consideration that is

15

different between civil law and criminal law.

16

So maybe

We don't have that in criminal law.

In criminal law, the person's going to go to

17

prison under a mandatory minimum sentence, and in some

18

cases for life with no parole based on this relaxed

19

causation standard that the government is asking this

20

Court to incorporate into a statute where it doesn't say

21

it.

22

And so we would respectfully ask for the

23

Court not to engage in that process, not to relax

24

causation for the criminal -- criminal statute at play

25

here and in all of the criminal statutes that use
