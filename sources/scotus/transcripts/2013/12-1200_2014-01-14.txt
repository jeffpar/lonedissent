ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

Mr. Chief Justice

and may it please the Court:

12

The judgment enforced against EBIA in this

13

case was entered by a non­Article III bankruptcy court

14

pursuant to a statute that this Court has declared

15

unconstitutional as violating the separation of powers.

16

The entry of a judgment of the United States

17

is not nearly a matter of private interest to the

18

litigants.

19

binding on other courts, binding on the executive branch

20

which must enforce the judgment, and even binding on the

21

legislature which cannot reopen the judgment.

Rather, it carries the force of law that is

22

The entry of final judgment of the United

23

States is the ultimate exercise of the judicial power

24

under Article III, just as the enactment of legislation

25

is the ultimate exercise of the legislative power under

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

Article I.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why should that matter

3

given that, after the bankruptcy judge ruled, the U.S.

4

District Court gave de novo review to this case and

5

entered a final judgment that met all the requirements

6

of Article III?

7

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

The judgment that

8

was entered by the district court was not an exercise of

9

original jurisdiction but rather appellate jurisdiction.

10

In fact, Section 1334 is clear that it confers the

11

district court original jurisdiction, but once a

12

judgment has been entered by the bankruptcy court, the

13

review by the district court is an exercise of appellate

14

jurisdiction under Section 158.

your argument.

19

the line that the bankruptcy judge signed, you would be

20

okay?

21

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

Yes, Your Honor.

22

But the act of entering judgment is, both as a legal

23

9

sitting as a matter of original jurisdiction, is not

10

available to the district court sitting on appeal.

That

13

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's true.
And it decided that

there were no issues, no factual issues in dispute and

16

that the law clearly applied the way it did.

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

I don't

On appellate

20

22

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

Sitting as an appellate

10

11

12

But I think more fundamentally, the absence

13

of a judgment entered by a court with authority to do so

14

means that the appellate court also lacks appellate

15

jurisdiction, and this Court has so recognized in

16

Ayrshire Collieries, in the Glidden case ­­

Which is where?

Where are

you reading?
MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

I'm using the

17

government's amicus brief, the statutory appendix that's

18

on page 4a.

19
20
21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't know why it wasn't

in your brief.
MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

It is in our brief.

22

The reason I cite to the government's brief is it also

23

has 1334.

24
25

It's slightly more comprehensive.

So on page 4a of the government's statutory
appendix, Section 158(a), "The district courts of the

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

United States shall have jurisdiction to hear appeals."
This Court has, in numerous decisions,

3

attributed significance to Congress's use of the word

4

"jurisdiction," that Congress knows what the word means

5

and when it uses that word, it means it is

6

jurisdictional.

7

The ­­ Section 1334, on the other hand,

8

which is on page 14a of the government's statutory

9

appendix, 1334(b) says that "The district courts shall

10

have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all

11

civil proceedings arising under Title 11."

12

So the district court does have original

13

jurisdiction at the outset, but when it has referred the

14

matter to the bankruptcy court and the bankruptcy court

15

has entered final judgment, then pursuant to 157(b) and

16

pursuant to 158(a), the district court is now exercising

17

appellate jurisdiction.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

There is a ­­ I

19

want you to get on a bit, because I'd say the question

20

that we're, at least for me, is one of congressional

21

intent, not in necessarily your case but in future

22

cases.

23

read, it silences, to say if Congress wanted to allow

24

people in noncore cases to submit reports and

25

recommendations, they surely would have wanted it in

And the argument that is that the statute can be

what they thought was a core case that turned out to be

2

3

So I want your response to that, and I would

4

couple that with my own research for an opinion when I

5

was one the First Circuit about the fraudulent

6

conveyances, and they are about bankruptcy.

7

I grant you that there is a Statute of

8

Elizabeth, it's a legal matter for several hundred

9

years, but the person who is defrauded, the people

10

defrauded are the creditors.

11

fraud consists of transferring property to a friend,

12

rather than a creditor, where you know you are

insolvent.

But why wouldn't Congress have, of course,

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

To be clear,

23

Congress designated fraudulent conveyance actions as

24

core.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

I know that, and I would

have said they were right.

2

with case law that says to the contrary.

3

question is, if they couldn't get ­­ if they couldn't

4

get what they wanted, which is to have the bankruptcy

5

judge decide it, why wouldn't they at least have wanted

6

the bankruptcy judge to write a report and

7

recommendations and send it on to the district judge so

8

he can review it de novo?

9

But, nonetheless, I am faced

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

Okay.

So my

10

what's constraining the court is the language that

11

Congress enacted.

JUSTICE BREYER:

that language, then you would say I would be sensible to

read it contrary to what you want.

6

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

Congress ­­

7

Congress very clearly distinguished a dichotomy between

8

those cases in which the bankruptcy courts were to issue

9

proposed findings and rec­ ­­ conclusions and those that

10
11

it was to hear and determine.
The cases that bankruptcy courts were to

hear and determine were cases in which the bankruptcy

13

courts were to enter final judgment subject only to

14

appellate review ­­

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

I've got it.

I'd like an

16

answer to my question.

17

assume that the language is at least somewhat ambiguous.

18

And on that assumption, is there any reason not to adopt

19

the government's position.

20

My question is I want you to

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

There are ­­ there

21

are several, Your Honor.

22

that the question of how to construe that language in

23

157(b) does not only affect how Stern claims are going

24

to be handled, but also, all other claims under 157(b).

25

Congress very clearly wanted an efficient system in

And part of the problem is

12
Alderson Reporting Company

which bankruptcy judges would enter judgment and there

2

would be only appellate review by the district courts.

3

If the Court reads 157(b)'s "hear and

5

issue non­final reports and recommendations, that would

6

not be limited to the class of cases covered by Stern

7

that are core, but not ­­

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

Well, why would we have to

do that, Mr. Hallward­Driemeier?

Why couldn't we say

10

that this presents a distinct problem, these Stern­type

11

claims, and it's really a problem of severability, and

12

that we should understand this statute in light of Stern

13

as essentially creating this middle category which

14

Congress clearly meant to have the treatment that the

15

noncore claims get.

16

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

It's ­­

17

unfortunately, the statutory language does not admit

18

of severance of the kind that Respondents suggest.

19

that's because fraudulent conveyance actions are core,

20

not simply because they're listed in 157(b)(2)(H), but

21

because they are proceedings that arise under Title 11.

22

That's the definition of core proceedings.

23

if the Court were to line out ­­

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And

And so even

But the definition ­­ the

definition was linked to a purpose.

13
Alderson Reporting Company

You­­ you laid out

Official

1

very nicely the two categories; the one category where

2

the bankruptcy judge enters a judgment, the other

3

category where the bankruptcy judge makes

4

recommendations.

5

classification was to indicate the bankruptcy judge can

6

make the final judgment, can only make recommendations.

7

So, if you ­­ the purpose of the

Suppose the district judge had said, I'm

8

uncertain after Stern about whether the bankruptcy judge

9

had authority to enter a final judgment.

So I am going

10

to treat that summary judgment as a recommendation.

11

I'll treat it as a recommendation and I will review it

12

de novo.

13
14

I agree, I enter final judgment.

If the district judge had said that, then
you would have no case, right?

15

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

I ­­ I don't think

16

that 157(b) envisions that the district court could do

17

that.

18

judgment entered under 157(b) is, on appeal, pursuant to

19

158, which is an exercise of appellate jurisdiction, not

20

original jurisdiction.

1

again, to apply severability principles to write the

2

statute that Congress would have written if it had known

3

about a constitutional ruling.

4

what Justice Breyer is suggesting.

5

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

And that's essentially

I think, Your

6

Honor, there are two problems with that.

7

by changing the definition of "core proceedings," there

8

are other collateral consequences for other provisions

9

of the code.

First is that

Under Section 1 ­­ 1334(c), for example,

10

there is an abstention in certain noncore proceedings.

11

And so Congress has defined the scope of the abstention

12

according to the same language that it uses in 157(b)

13

whether a proceeding arises under Title 11 or does not

14

do so, but is merely in relation to a case under Title

15

11.

16

So if the Court goes and revises what

17

Congress has provided as the definition of core in

18

157(b), there will be collateral consequences for other

19

statutes that Congress had enacted.

20

But the second point is that there are, as I

21

think Justice Scalia was suggesting, policy decisions

22

that really only Congress can make in deciding how to

23

respond to Stern, because one can compare, for example,

24

the provisions of 157(c)(1), which is the bankruptcy

25

judge issuing a proposed findings and conclusions, and

16
Alderson Reporting Company

2

different.

The two are actually quite

3

The magistrates, for example, are assigned a

4

specific motion to consider and issue a report and

5

recommendation on.

6

(c)(1) exercises jurisdiction over the entire

7

proceeding, including up to conducting a trial in

something that isn't subject to jury trial, and then

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

Well, I ­­ to

5

begin, I think the formalities do matter and not only do

6

I think so.

7

absence of a judgment entered with authority means the

8

absence of appellate jurisdiction as well.

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

To the contrary,

7

Your Honor, in Schor, the Court made clear that where

8

the structural features of the Constitution are at

9

issue, that is precisely where parties cannot be

10

depended upon to assert the interest, and it cannot be

11

joined by consent.

12

And here we have an example.

The constitutional violation identified by

13

the Court in Stern existed for 25 years before the issue

14

finally made it to this Court.

15

were reluctant to assert that issue before a bankruptcy

16

court in which its fate held.

In part because parties

17

The ­­ the issues here, the other side says

18

there is no structural problem because there's no

19

aggrandizement or encroachment.

20

Congress has reserved to itself power over bankruptcy

21

judges that the Constitution denies it over Article III

22

judges.

23
24
25

But to the contrary,

The President's power to appoint has been
encroached upon.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, couldn't you say the

19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

same thing once again about magistrates, the exact same

2

arguments would apply to them?

3

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

I think in large

4

part they do.

5

an important distinction, that in the Magistrates Act,

6

the consent requirement is built into the statute.

7

Although there is a distinction, perhaps

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I don't see why that

8

would make a difference if you say the problem is

9

congressional aggrandizement or congressional

10

encroachment of a certain kind.

11

to make any difference in that case, if Congress says,

12

by the way, you can consent to it.

13

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

It doesn't seem to me

You're absolutely

14

right, Your Honor.

15

this Court identified in Stern and that we identify here

16

applies equally to the magistrates.

17

explained that that argument, even if not accepted in

18

full, would distinguish our case from the Magistrates

19

Act, because here, the Act enacted by Congress was

20

unconstitutional.

21

this action to determination and final judgment by a

22

bankruptcy judge.

23

held it unconstitutional in Stern.

24
25

And I think that the problem that

But we have

It assigned, irregardless of consent,

The Court considered this statute and

So if consent were to cure the problem here,
then the jurisdiction of the Court would depend solely

on the consent of the parties.

2

the Court was considering in the first instance whether

3

consent as a limiting feature on the jurisdiction of the

4

non­Article III body meant that there was not the types

5

of structural problems that the Court identified in

6

Stern, then it would be as part of the determination

7

whether there was or was not an Article III violation in

8

the first instance.

JUSTICE ALITO:

If, on the other hand,

May I ask you to clarify

10

what you're saying about the constitutionality of the

11

Magistrates Act?

12

unconstitutional insofar as it allows magistrate judges

13

to try matters by consent, or are you saying further

14

that it is unconstitutional insofar as it allows a

15

district judge to refer a dispositive matter to a

16

magistrate judge for a report and recommendation subject

17

to de novo review, or both?

­­ about the logic

of the argument and how far it went.

And ­­ and, I guess, again, what we suggest

is that there might be a distinction when the Court is

considering a statute.

5

factors that the Court might consider, the fact that

6

consent is a limiting feature on the non­Article III

7

body's jurisdiction might lead the Court to conclude

8

there was no Article III violation.

And as Schor lays out the many

The statute does not

21

We have held differently in other

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

I'm not arguing

22

that there cannot be implied consent, but in Roell,

23

as ­­ as a construction of the Magistrates Act, the

24

Court held that consent must be knowing and voluntary.

25

There, of course, the litigant had notice because the

Alderson Reporting Company

1

statute had advised the litigant that it had the right

2

to refuse consent.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You're confusing me.

I

thought you ­­ you did say that there can't be implied

5

consent or even express consent to what happened here.

6

Isn't that your position?

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

I'm ­­ I'm sorry.

8

I was ­­ I was ­­ I thought I was answering a different

13

MR. POTTOW:

We held

No, you held it

14

unconstitutional regarding an objecting defendant.

15

There's been hundreds of years of consensual

16

adjudication with these inferior judicial officers, as

17

that they were called in the earlier cases, such as

18

Go­Bart.

19

They are officers.

They're inferior

20

judicial officers, and they are controlled by the

21

Article III judiciary.

22

retains the control to use them or not use them as they

23

want, and parties can't be forced to do them over their

25

The Article III judiciary

So when this Court has had opportunity to

Alderson Reporting Company

1

address Article III concerns of this, they have always

2

relied upon the lack of consent as a problem.

3

that's why this Court's formulation in Stern, I think,

4

is critical, just following Union Carbide, and indeed

5

every opinion in Northern Pipeline, going back to the

6

MacDonald case under the old act.

7

is the lack of consent.

8

there is consent, this Court held in MacDonald,

13

Indeed, when there's implied consent, this

And as the American College also lays out

14

well, these old statutory cases under the old Bankruptcy

15

Act were interpreted with constitutional values in mind.

16

The old act was very cryptically drafted and tersely

drafted, so this Court used constitutional principles in

18

interpreting the scope of the old Bankruptcy Act and

19

upholding the consensual adjudication of plenary matters

20

when there is consent.

So our submission, Mr. Chief Justice, is

yes, we do think that the consent matters.

He has not ­­ he did not advance this argument at any

5

point ­­ any reasonable point before the bankruptcy

6

judge, before the district judge, until he was before

7

the Court of Appeals.

8

this Court had already granted certiorari in Stern and

9

had already heard oral argument in Stern before the

district court even ruled on the motion for summary

6

7

Seventh Amendment.

claim for purposes of the constitutional argument ­­

it because we he was claiming the fraudulent conveyance

12

claim in his answer was noncore.

the argument.

15

certainly did, as my colleague already pointed out on

16

page 80 of the Joint Appendix and paragraph 2.1 of the

17

answer denied the allegation that this was a core

18

proceeding.

19

And if you look, then, to 157(c)(1) and (2),

20

the statute made consent relevant at that point, and

21

Rule 7012, which, Justice Sotomayor, you were earlier

22

quoting, made it clear that he was obliged, then, to ­­

23

or petitioner was obliged, then, to ­­ to give consent

24

or not.

25

But if I can turn to the severability

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

question, which was also the focus of a lot of the

2

argument before, Justice Scalia, you pointed out that

3

Congress can rewrite the statute the way it wants to.

4

And that's, of course, true.

5

when this Court gets to a severability analysis that

6

Congress didn't get its first option.

7

did include a severability clause in the 1984 Act.

8

in Section 119, and it says, if any provision of this

left can stand.

16

MR. GANNON:

If you carve ­­ if you find

You don't say that we're going to

I don't think any rewriting is

17

required here, Mr. Chief Justice.

And I think that this is

18

actually essentially what the Court has already said in

19

Stern.

20

the effect of its decision as being, "The removal of

21

Vicky's counterclaim there from core bankruptcy

22

jurisdiction."

In Stern, on page 2620, this Court characterized

23

And the consequence of that is that, because

24

the Congress had divided the world into core and noncore

25

proceedings in the wake of Northern Pipeline, thinking

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that the distinction between them was core proceedings

2

were ones in which bankruptcy judges would have

3

authority, constitutional authority to enter final

4

judgments; noncore proceedings were ones in which they

5

could not do that without consent, or they would only be

6

able to provide proposed findings of fact and

7

conclusions of law.

8
9

And in the same paragraph where this Court noted
that the effect of its decision was effectively to

10

remove this, that type of counterclaim from core

11

jurisdiction, it said that it did not expect that this

12

decision would meaningfully change the division of labor

13

between the bankruptcy and district court judges,

14

precisely because Pearce Marshall was not contesting the

15

idea that bankruptcy judges would still be able to enter

16

proposed findings of facts and conclusions of law.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Or it may be because

18

the particular claim at issue in Stern was one that

19

wasn't expected to arise in the normal course in

20

bankruptcy proceedings.

Yes, but that would suggest

that arbitration is more constitutionally problematic

beyond their Article III authority simply because the

two parties before them agree that they should.

16

MR. GANNON:

They don't enter judgments

That's true, Mr. Chief Justice.

17

In cases like Heckers and Kimberly, courts, in light of

18

a previous reference from the Court and the consent of

19

the parties agreed to have their power of de novo review

limited.

we think that the judgment of the decision below should

be affirmed.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice.
I have four points in response.

First with

6

respect to the history.

7

instances in which the non­Article III actor entered the

8

judgment of the United States.

9

Hecker's and Kimberly were not

In Hecker's, the Court compared the

10

referee's actions akin to a jury.

11

course, only finds facts.

12

whether to enter judgment on the basis of the jury's

13

verdict.

14

pursuant to the parties' contract, but until they bring

15

it to the court and judgment is entered confirming ­­

And a jury, of

Only the court can decide

Likewise an arbitrator can decide facts

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

What are we supposed to

17

assume here on this point?

In Thomas, this Court held

18

that what Northern Pipeline establishes is that Congress

19

cannot vest in a non­Article III court the power to

20

adjudicate without consent of the litigants.

21

the holding.

22

So that's

Now, if we are going to go back into Crowell and

23

Benson and the power of agencies and whether we want to reverse

24

the things that were held in 1938 and so forth, I guess we

25

should have briefing on that.

Am I supposed to assume

56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that this is a case ­­ I thought I assumed what we have

2

held before in respect to constitutionality.

3

whether Northern Pipeline extends to where it is with

4

consent of the parties.

5

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

Not

Although Northern

6

Pipeline, because the party had objected, did not

7

address the question whether consent ­­

JUSTICE BREYER:
from Thomas.

Now, you heard what I read

I was just reading it, and it talks about

10

without consent.

11

to open up these issues again?

12

views on that, but they don't necessarily ­­ they won't

13

necessarily command a majority, but I think we should

14

have briefing.

So what I want to know is are we going

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

Because I have my own

No, Your Honor.

17

Because the earlier cases do not establish an authority

18

to enter judgment of the United States by a ­­

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

My question is are we

20

supposed to go into that or do we just take as assumed

21

what Thomas said and Stern said, and I think ­­ you know

22

what I said.

23

I don't want to repeat myself.

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

Well, Thomas

24

certainly does not foreclose the argument that I'm

25

making because ­­

57
Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SCALIA:

okay without consent.

They didn't say that it's

3

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

with consent.

6
7

They just say it is okay

They didn't address the point.

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

That's right, Your

Honor.

8
9

Right.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think we should have

briefing on the point if we are going into it.

10

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

And Kimberly,

11

again, referred to the confirmation of the award, again

12

the judgment being entered by the court.

13

The ­­ in Roell, which really marks the

14

furthest extent of the recognition of consent and the

15

role that it can play with respect to judgments and, of

16

course, the Article III argument was not advanced by the

17

parties there.

Both parties agreed that consent would

18

be sufficient.

But significantly, even in Roell, the

19

Court said that the consent would have to be knowing and

20

voluntary consent.

21

here.

22

had told EBIA that it had no right to an Article III

23

judge for pretrial motions.

And we have the opposite of that

Because both the legislature and the judiciary

24

And although my friend ­­

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But you had an

58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

outstanding motion to withdraw the reference.

2

district court gave you the option of proceeding with

3

that motion and having it determine the rest of the case

4

or to go and listen ­­ or go back to the bankruptcy

5

court and let the bankruptcy court manage this and you

6

chose the latter.

7

your ­­ your adversary speaks about, because your

8

co­defendant had won in bankruptcy court.

9

were riding your chances.

10

And the

I think obviously for the reasons

MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:

I think you

No, Your Honor, to

11

the contrary, and we don't need to hypothesize because

12

the record is clear, the motion was to withdraw for

13

purpose of conducting a jury trial because our client

14

recognized that Ninth Circuit precedent

15

Healthcentral.Com explicitly held after Granfinanciera,

16

that although you might have a Seventh Amendment jury

17

trial right to an Article III judge, that did not

18

entitle you to Article III determination of pretrial

19

motions including summary judgment motion on a

20

fraudulent conveyance claim.

21

Our client cited that, recognized it, it had no right to

22

Article III court prior to trial.

23

It was directly on point.

So the motion to withdraw was limited to the

24

motion for a trial if the court got that far.

25

suggestion that in the answer we disputed that

59
Alderson Reporting Company

So the

Official

1

fraudulent conveyance actions are core is not consistent

2

with the record.

3

The complaint had listed eight causes of

4

action, several of which were core, several noncore, and

5

then a single concluding allegation that the proceeding

6

was core.

7

that allegation.
