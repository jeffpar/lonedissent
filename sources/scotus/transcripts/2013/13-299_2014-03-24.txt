CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

this morning in Case 13­299, Clark versus Rameker.
Mr. Shanmugam.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
This case concerns the Bankruptcy Code's

11

retirement funds exemption.

12

provision categorically exempts funds that have been set

13

aside for retirement in certain tax­exempt retirement

14

accounts.

15

account qualify for the exemption first because they

16

were set aside for retirement when they were deposited

17

in the account, and second, because an IRA remains tax

18

exempt after it passes to a beneficiary upon the death

19

of its initial owner.

20

By its plain terms, that

Funds in an inherited individual retirement

Respondents ask this Court to exclude

21

inherited IRAs by engrafting an additional limitation on

22

to the statute.

23

must be in an account that not only is tax exempt, but

24

also possesses certain "objective features."

25

Under their interpretation, the funds

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's true, I think, that

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the Respondents have to explain why their position

2

doesn't commit us to a difficult case­by­case

3

adjudication down the line, and yours is a more simple

4

approach.

5

really rendered the words "retirement funds"

6

superfluous.

7

11

On the other hand, it seems to me that you

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I don't think that

that is true, Justice Kennedy.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean, the words in the

bankruptcy statute.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yes.

And ­­ and let me

12

explain why we think that retirement funds are not

13

superfluous here.

14

retirement funds serves a clarifying function with the

15

result that in the event that if Congress were to add

16

something to one of the many tax provisions that are

17

incorporated into the provision, that is not a

18

retirement account, that would be excluded.

19

First of all, we think that

In other words, the phrase "retirement

20

funds" makes clear that only funds that have been set

21

aside in a retirement account are exempted.

22

But I want to say something more broadly

23

about this argument concerning superfluity, which I

24

think is really at the core of Respondents' textual

25

argument here.

I think that argument really

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

misapprehends, with respect, the structure of the

2

statute.

3

matters currently stand, the phrase "retirement funds"

4

does not independently exclude anything from the scope

5

of the statute.

6

"to the extent that" clause.

7

gives the phrase "retirement funds" meaning.

8

it a broader meaning.

9

It may very well be true that at least as

But this statute, of course, includes a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But, Mr. Shanmugam, it

11

13

this.

gets exempt from ­­ from the creditors' claim, it just

21

seems incongruous considering how narrow Congress has

22

made the other exemptions.

23

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Congress was very careful when it crafted

It said what, 22 ­­ something over $22,000,
Is it likely that Congress would

I mean, this big pot of money

Two points in response to

24

that.

25

admittedly very high cap on retirement funds, it is true

First, Justice Ginsburg, with regard to the

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that a beneficiary of an inherited IRA has the ability

2

to withdraw the funds immediately, though Congress has

3

created considerable tax incentives for such an

4

individual not to do so.

5

for example, an individual who holds a 457(b) account,

6

that's a retirement account for employees of certain

7

governmental entities and nonprofits, who has left

8

employment and then goes into bankruptcy.

9

But the same could be said of,

So, too, with regard to an individual who

10

holds a Roth IRA, at least with regard to the

11

contributions that the individual made to that IRA.

12

And, in fact, while the cap limits the amount of money

13

that can be exempted at $1.25 million, it actually also

14

contains exceptions for rollover IRAs such that an

15

individual can exempt essentially an unlimited amount.

16

All of which is to say that Congress did intend this

17

exemption to be quite expansive.

18

Now, to go to the first part of your

19

question, Justice Ginsburg, and the text of the statute.

20

The court of appeals, unlike Respondent ­­ Respondents

out in our brief.

14

And those are the

The two primary types of accounts for which

15

money can be withdrawn without penalty are Roth IRAs and

16

these 457(b)'s that I was referring to a minute earlier.

17

Now, I do want to say just one more thing

18

about the text of the statute in response to Justice

19

Ginsburg.

20

here, offered an interpretation under which retirement

21

funds would mean funds that have been set aside for the

22

debtor's own retirement.

23

that interpretation is that it reads an additional

24

limitation into the statute, this debtor­based

25

limitation.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

wouldn't that always be a debtor's?

MR. SHANMUGAM:

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12
13

Well ­­
The name is generally a

debtor's.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, that is certainly

14

true, which is to say that that limitation would

15

obviously exclude inherited IRAs and inherited IRAs

16

alone.

17

there were any evidence that Congress had actually

18

focused on this issue and if in fact Congress's intent

19

had been to exclude inherited IRAs, this would be a very

20

odd way of going about effectuating that intent through

21

this negative inference from the phrase "retirement

22

funds."

23

And I would just note parenthetically that if

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, let's suppose there

account.

owner, it is still considerable.

14

is true that the beneficiary of an inherited IRA must

consequences over the course of her own lifetime.

JUSTICE ALITO:

8

that is correct as an empirical matter, Justice Alito.

9

And as we explain in our brief, as long as the annual

10

rate of return is a reasonable one, it will often be the

11

case and, indeed, it's a quite plausible scenario, that

12

a beneficiary will end up with more or roughly the same

13

amount in the account at retirement as at the time ­­

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yes, that is correct.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

strange feature of a retirement fund, that you can't add

That doesn't seem like a

retirement fund in people's natural understanding of the

2

language.

3

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, at the risk of seeming

4

flip, Justice Kagan, I think that one point that's

5

important to keep in mind is that this is still

6

denominated a retirement account.

7

substantively important and not just a formalism is

8

because that has significant tax consequences.

9

funds remain exempt as long as they remain in the

10
11

account.

And why that's actually

The

And to go to Justice ­­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Wasn't the purpose of

12

that, however, to see that the beneficiary wasn't going

13

to be hit with a huge tax liability if it had to take

14

the whole thing all at once?

15

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But it also gives the

16

beneficiary the ability to use the funds in the account

17

for her own retirement.

18

Now, just to be clear, we don't think that

19

whether or not the beneficiary in fact does so is

20

relevant, precisely because of the language that

21

Congress chose.

22

And, Justice Alito, to go to the underlying

23

policy justifications here ­­ and I do so with the

24

proviso that we obviously think that the plain language

25

disposes of this case without any need to weigh the

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

policy justifications.

2

fact, important and compelling policy justifications to

3

support our interpretation, and we think that it is

4

therefore no accident that seven States in the last 3

5

years alone have expressly exempted inherited IRAs.

6

But we think that there are, in

The first of those policy justifications is

7

that Congress wanted to link bankruptcy exemption to tax

8

exemption and there is some evidence in the legislative

9

history to support that as the policy justification for

10

this very expansive provision.

11

enacted the retirement funds exemption knowing that

12

there were already other exemptions or exceptions that

13

covered a vast range of retirement accounts and yet

14

Congress deliberately chose this very broad language in

15

order to provide even broader protection and, really, to

16

link bankruptcy exemption ­­ bankruptcy protection to

17

tax protection.

18
19
20

JUSTICE ALITO:

After all, Congress

Why would Congress want to

do that?
MR. SHANMUGAM:

I think really for ease of

21

application.

22

already made judgments about which types of retirement

23

accounts should be subject to special treatment.

24

the retirement funds exemption simply creates congruence

25

between the Bankruptcy Code and the Tax Code.

Congress in the Tax Code has obviously

12
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

Now, to be sure, we don't think that that's

2

the only relevant policy justification here.

3

think that the fact that Congress has made considerable

4

tax benefits available to the holders of inherited IRAs

5

is indeed significant.

6

provided this ability for the beneficiaries of inherited

7

IRAs to stretch out the tax consequences over the course

8

of their entire lifetimes.

12

The

She had taken out more than

16

the required minimum distributions before she went into

17

bankruptcy and then she took out one additional extra

18

distribution immediately after going into bankruptcy.

19

But I think it is fair to say that, regardless of the

20

circumstances of my clients, many individuals who are in

21

this position will use these inherited IRAs as

22

retirement tools or at a minimum as long­term financial

23

planning tools.

24

with that policy interest, an interest that is expressed

25

in the relevant tax provisions, to exempt inherited

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Shanmugam, can I go back

3

to Justice Kennedy's statement, because I wasn't quite

sure I understood your answer.

5

6

and you said, well, just in case Congress adds something

7

later to these sections.

8

there was a second point, too.

9

point?

10

He asked why did they

And then you thought that

MR. SHANMUGAM:

And what was the second

I think my second point,

11

Justice Kagan, was simply that the use of the phrase

12

"retirement funds" really makes clear the purpose of

13

this provision in a way that I think would obviously not

14

be clear absent that reference.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, why would that be

16

important to Congress, that it wanted to clarify the

17

purpose of the provision, if you're saying that

18

everything that was currently in, that was currently ­­

19

that currently received tax protection in these

20

sections, counted?

21

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I think that it is

22

admittedly descriptive.

23

time it enacted this provision may not have been 100

24

percent sure that everything in those tax provisions was

25

in fact a retirement account.

And to be sure, Congress at the

Because if you take a

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

look at Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code, it may

2

be many things, but immediately clear it certainly is

3

not.

4

that only funds that have been set aside in retirement

5

accounts are exempted, whether with reference to the Tax

6

Code as it currently stands or with regard to anything

7

that might subsequently be added to the tax code in the

8

future.

And so Congress may have just wanted to ensure

9

But again, I think it's really important to

10

underscore the structure of this particular provision.

11

I think when you have a statute that contains a phrase

12

like "to the extent that," it is in fact entirety

13

natural for what comes before that clause, the

14

antecedent, if you will, to set out a broad category

15

which is then narrowed by the "to the extent that"

16

clause.

17

And so, for example, if you had a statute

18

that created a tax break for sports teams to the extent

19

that they are members of the major professional sports

20

leagues, you wouldn't immediately think that the phrase

21

"sports teams" has to somehow do some exclusionary work.

22

It would be perfectly natural to view "sports teams" as

23

an incredibly broad category that could include little

24

league teams as well, but then view the "to the extent

25

that" clause to narrow it to teams that play in Major

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

League Baseball or the National Football League.
So too here, "retirement funds" simply

3

refers to funds that have been set aside for retirement

4

and the "to the extent that" clause narrows that broad

5

category to funds that have been set aside and remain in

6

the enumerated types of retirement accounts.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you still have

8

the problem of figuring out set aside, you know, by ­­

9

by whom.

It seems to me that if you inherit one of

10

these IRAs and somebody, you know, asked you about it,

11

you could say, well, my mother ­­ you know, you wouldn't

12

say, would you, my mother left me a retirement account?

13

You would say my mother left me $300,000.

14
15
16

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, you might say either

of those things, Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I know, but I think

17

it's more likely that you would be describing ­­ if you

18

said a retirement account, it would seem to me to be

19

confusing to the normal English speaker, while if you

20

say what the amount is, I mean, that's what you got and

21

you could take it all out the next day, which is why the

22

retirement aspect would seem to be incidental.

23

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I don't think that

24

there actually is anything odd about that, and I think

25

in part that's because of what these accounts actually

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

are.

2

retirement accounts, and there are a few references to

3

inherited IRAs in the statute, but they really remain

4

individual retirement accounts in the most relevant

5

sense.

6

We refer to them as inherited individual

I don't think there's really any dispute

7

that, even in the hands of a beneficiary, an individual

8

retirement account remains tax exempt under Section

9

408(e) of the Internal Revenue Code.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm not sure why tax

11

exemption is the point.

12

retirement funds was that you would keep the money to a

13

certain designated age, 59­1/2.

14

your opponent is arguing.

15

irrelevant to the Roth IRA, so it can't be that tax

16

exemption is the meaning of a retirement fund.

17

I thought the point of

I think that's what

The tax consequences are

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But I think, Justice

18

Sotomayor, that is what it means in the context of this

19

statute.

20
21
22

And our interpretation ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But why?

Roth IRAs.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Right.

23

tax exempt.

24

the account, they remain tax exempt.

25

This includes

The Roth IRAs remain

That is to say, as long as the funds are in

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They are tax exempt,

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

period, because taxes were paid when the money was put

2

in.

3

MR. SHANMUGAM:

That's correct.

But they

4

also remain tax exempt while they're in the account.

5

And so to give you an example, if, for instance, you

6

have an IRA or a Roth IRA and you engage in certain

7

transactions, you move funds out of a particular stock

8

and move them into another stock, you would ordinarily

9

have to pay capital gains.

But as long as they remain

10

in the account, they are not subject to taxation.

11

That's all that "tax exempt" means in the statute.

12

But I think more broadly, our interpretation

13

of the statute really reads the statute as an integrated

14

whole.

15

if it stopped after the phrase "retirement funds," and

16

someone might be able to argue, for instance, that if

17

they put money aside in a general purpose investment

18

account, that would qualify as long as they intended to

19

use those funds for retirement.

20

To be sure, it might be a very different statute

But under our interpretation, "retirement

21

funds" has to be read in the context of the "to the

22

extent that" clause, and that clause really explains how

23

it is that the funds are set aside for retirement.

24

Funds have to be set aside in one of the enumerated

25

types of accounts in order to qualify.

18
Alderson Reporting Company

And I think this

Official

1

discussion really points up the fundamental textual flaw

2

with Respondents' interpretation.

3

Respondents talk at great length in their

4

brief about the supposed objective features that define

5

a retirement account.

6

many of those features are not shared by all of the

7

enumerated accounts in the statute.

8

importantly, Congress specified, Justice Sotomayor, the

9

one objective feature that matters for purposes of the

As we explain in our reply brief,

But more

10

application of the exemption, and that is the tax­exempt

11

status of the funds in the account, and that is all that

12

is required in order to trigger this very expansive

13

provision.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

extent that you don't take the option to take it out at

calculations.

Looks to me as though you're going ­­ at the age of

trustee for equitable distribution among creditors with

And in return for that,

Now, there are exceptions to that, which are

So the bankruptcy exemptions really balance

a set of competing interests:

debtor's interest in obtaining a fresh start; on the

14

other hand, the creditors' interest in a fair and

equitable distribution on account of their legitimate

claims, and also society at large's interest in ensuring

8

MS. SPINELLI:

I think our basic position is

that at the time the bankruptcy petition is filed, which

10

is at the time that the exemptions are determined and

11

the only relevant time for purposes of this case, the

12

funds are not set aside for anyone's retirement.

13

are no longer set aside for the original owner's

not set aside for the debtor's retirement because of the

30
Alderson Reporting Company

I think that

Official

1

I think that's so because the date on which the

it is only the debtor's retirement funds that are

relevant.

the bankruptcy exemptions is to ensure the support of

So, I mean, this is something that applies to masses of

4

people, and it seems to me that if ­­ if Congress meant

to exclude these inherited IRAs, why wouldn't it have

said so?

explicit to exclude them?

15

MS. SPINELLI:

Well, Justice Kagan, I

16

believe Congress did exclude them by using the phrase

17

"retirement funds" as to doing something more explicit.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, that's at the least a

very ambiguous way to exclude them.

In

I mean, that's

As ­­ as to whether Congress

could have done something more explicit, I think one

37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

thing that's important to understand is that inherited

2

IRAs are not some special kind of account.

3

they're simply an IRA of whatever type, a traditional

4

IRA, a Roth IRA, any other kind of IRA that has been

5

passed to a non­spousal beneficiary, and the same thing

6

is true of qualified retirement plans.

7

Rather,

For all of those plans, under our reading,

8

as they are all exempt in the hands of the original

9

owner and they are all exempt in the hands of a spousal

10

beneficiary.

11

treatment when they are inherited by a non­spousal

12

beneficiary that makes them not retirement funds.

13

so for that ­­ for that reason, I think it was perfectly

14

understandable of Congress to put the limit "retirement

15

funds" into the statute.

It's only the fundamental change in

And

16

And I also think, Justice Kennedy, that ­­ I

17

hope that that starts to answer your question as to why

18

our reading doesn't commit the courts to a difficult

19

case­by­case approach.

20

think the analysis is actually quite similar to the

21

analysis this Court engaged in in Rousey where it had to

22

answer the question, is a traditional IRA similar to a

23

stock bonus, pension, profit sharing or annuity plan.

24
25

I don't believe it does.

I

In that case, the Court framed the question
as:

Do the objective characteristics of the account

2

substitutes for wages, or more like simply a

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why do you suppose seven

States have provided an exemption for inherited IRAs?
MS. SPINELLI:

I don't know, Justice Alito,

7

but I would say that States frequently do provide more

8

generous exemptions than the Federal government, and ­­

9

but, you know, the unlimited homestead exemption that's

10

available in some States is a good example.

11

believe that it's consistent with the structure and

12

purpose of the bankruptcy exemptions to permit a debtor

13

to exempt a potentially unlimited amount of funds that

14

can be used for current consumption that are not in any

15

way set aside for the debtor's own retirement.

16

no other exemption in the bankruptcy exemptions that

17

works that way, that withholds that kind of unlimited

18

amount of free cash from creditor's legitimate claims.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Of course.

definition of retirement funds, are there any retirement

24

funds that do not fall within the denominated sections

Alderson Reporting Company

MS. SPINELLI:

If one looked at the phrase

2

"retirement funds" in isolation, I think it could have a

3

much broader meaning.

4

the cash in a box under the bed that someone is saving

5

for retirement.

6

the exemption to the specific tax­exempt accounts

8

think, makes clear that "retirement funds" has to be

9

understood in that context and that an objective

22

I think that ­­ and maybe this was not a good example,

25

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

"Retirement funds to the extent that those funds are in

3

that's logically true.

I don't think

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I might have lost

6

you, but no one says "lawyers to the extent they are

8

They say "lawyers who are women."

MS. SPINELLI:

Correct.

But nonetheless, I

9

think that the phrase "to the extent that" is extremely

10

helpful to our analysis, because if it weren't the case

11

that these are two independent requirements that phrase

12

wouldn't be necessary.

Petitioners' reading would do, because it is the direct

JUSTICE BREYER:

43

what the court of appeals did ­­ because of the language

of the rest of the statute.

21

this Court relied on in Rousey in determining whether

22

funds were a substitute for wages in retirement.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.
I'd like to start with the text of the

1

statute.

2

"retirement funds" as funds that have been set aside for

3

the debtor's own retirement.

4

from the arguments this morning that Respondents really

5

don't defend that interpretation.

6

wondering why.

7

the reason why is the reason that was exposed in Ms.

8

Spinelli's colloquy with Justice Breyer:

9

interpretation really would nakedly read an additional

The court of appeals in its opinion defined

Why, I would respectfully submit that

That

limitation into the statute.
And I want to address Ms. Spinelli's

12

argument as to why that is not so and explain why that

13

is in fact so.

14

that Justice Breyer recited, it is true that to some

15

extent the references to the debtor simply confirm what

16

Section 541 already makes clear, namely that the debtor

17

after all has to have a property interest in the

18

property in question at the time the debtor goes into

19

bankruptcy.

20

limitations relevant to the debtor's use of the

21

property.

22

If you take a look at the 11 exemptions

But those exemptions also contain

And if you take a look at page 5(a) of

23

Respondent's brief and the text of Section 522(d)(1),

24

the homestead exemption, that text makes this point

25

clear.

The homestead exemption reads, and I'm quoting:

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

"The debtor's aggregate interest," not to exceed a

2

certain amount in value, "in real property or personal

3

property that the debtor or a dependent of the debtor

4

uses as a residence."

5

limitation that the court of appeals was reading into

6

the retirement funds exemption.

7

sort of limitation is entirely absent.

8

9

others of the exemptions.

10

That is precisely the type of

And of course, that

Now, I think that because of that problem

11

Respondents instead offer this objective features

interpretation.

13

references to the objective features in the course of

14

her argument, she didn't actually tell us what those

15

objective features actually are.

23

25

they are retirement funds.

2

MR. SHANMUGAM:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

Well ­­
And in the hands of the

inheriting person, by and large they are not.

5

MR. SHANMUGAM:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well ­­
And so that's why she

7

thinks the one falls within and the other falls without

8

the phrase "retirement funds."

9

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, let's focus on the

10

objective features that Respondents did identify in

11

their brief, and two of those features were limitations

12

on early withdrawals and required minimum distributions

13

after retirement.

14

brief, at least as to some of these types of accounts,

15

even in the hands of the initial owner those limitations

16

would not apply.

17

And as we explained in our reply

And I would respectfully submit that if

18

there is one thing that is reasonably clear from the

19

legislative history, it's that Congress certainly wanted

20

to provide protection for all of these types of accounts

21

when they are in the hands of the initial owner.

22

any sort of test like that, a by­and­large test, would be

23

a recipe for chaos in the lower courts, as bankruptcy

24

courts have to try to figure out whether particular

25

types of accounts, even in the hands of initial owners,

48

Ms. Spinelli referred to this ­­

8

withdrawals, which do not apply to Roths and to 457(b)s

9

and ­­ and with regard to Roths, that is true only with

10

regard to contributions, but, of course, the

11

contributions to a Roth can be a very substantial part

12

of the funds in the account.

13

distributions after a retirement, which Roth IRAs do not

14

possess.

15

And then required minimum

And I want to say just one other thing on

16

the text with regard to Rousey.

17

involved very different language, and Congress was

18

legislating against the backdrop of Rousey when it

19

adopted the retirement funds exemption.

20

adopted that exemption, it contained no limitation on

21

whether or not the payments were being received on

22

account of age, but instead swept much more broadly,

23

focusing on the accounts and focusing on the one

24

objective feature of the accounts that matters, the

25

tax­exempt status of the funds in the account.

Rousey itself obviously

49

But when it

And so Rousey, I would respectfully submit,
really offers Respondents little help.
I want to say just a word about the policy

4

issue that we were discussing during my opening

5

argument.

6

in fact, going to be relatively young and, therefore,

7

more likely to make free use of the funds.

This question of whether beneficiaries are,

8

First of all, as Justice Kagan pointed out,

9

beneficiaries have every incentive to keep the funds in

10

the account because of the tax benefits.

11

it's more important to kind of understand the reality of

12

this type of situation.

13

Heidi Heffron­Clark, was about 22 years old when she

14

inherited this account.

15

a very young age.

16

indicated that the prime age for inheritance is between

17

the age of 50 and 59.

18

retirement accounts in the hands of an initial owner,

the funds can be accessed at the age of 59 1/2.

will often be the case that the beneficiaries will use

the funds for retirement.
