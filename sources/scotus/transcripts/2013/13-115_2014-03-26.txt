ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GERSHENGORN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The Ninth Circuit held that individual

11

Secret Service agents could be held personally liable

12

for their on­the­spot decision to reposition a group of

13

about 200 to 300 demonstrators who were within weapon's

14

range of President Bush as he made an unscheduled ­­ as

15

he made an unscheduled stop for dinner at an outdoor

16

restaurant patio.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

May I ask a question?

18

So were the pro­Bush demonstrators.

19

pro­Bush demonstrators were across the street pretty

20

much at a diagonal to the President, and they were

21

permitted to remain there the entire time.

22

had a throwing distance of a bomb or a shooting distance

23

as well.

24
25

MR. GERSHENGORN:

In fact, the

He ­­ they

So, Your Honor, the

pro­Bush demonstrators were differently situated from

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the anti­Bush demonstrators in several fundamental

2

respects.

3

there was a two­story building between the pro­Bush

4

protestors and the ­­ where the President was dining.

5

It's in stark contrast to the open alley that led down

6

precisely to the six­foot wooden fence behind which the

7

President was dining, which is where the anti­Bush

8

protestors were.

9

With respect to the weapons range, there ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That was after the

10

second move, not the first.

11

MR. GERSHENGORN:

No, Your Honor.

At the

12

first move, when the President arrived for dinner,

13

the ­­ the pro­Bush protesters were on the north ­­ the

14

anti­Bush protesters were on the north side of

15

California Street between Third and Fourth, and the

16

alley that led right down to the restaurant patio was

17

right there.

18
19
20

The ­­ they were at the head of the alley.

So they were very differently situated from
the pro­Bush protesters.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Counsel, I don't understand

21

the government to be making the argument, and I can't

22

understand why it isn't making the argument, that it

23

doesn't matter whether there was any intent to suppress

24

anti­Bush demonstrations, that in this area, as in

25

traffic stops, we don't consult subjective intent.

4

If ­­ if a policeman stops somebody,

2

and it's, oh, you stopped me only because I was coming

3

back from an anti­Bush demonstration, we wouldn't ­­ we

4

wouldn't listen to that argument.

5

have a broken taillight or not?

6

taillight, we do not inquire into the subjective intent

7

of the officer.

You haven't made it.
We don't think it's ­­ I

13

position is that it is not clearly established law, that

21

unconstitutional, we don't inquire into it.

22

You don't have to get into clearly
It's a very simple case.

MR. GERSHENGORN:

retaliatory arrest, if there is an objectively

2

reasonable basis for the move ­­ for the repositioning,

3

such as a valid security rationale, it's not clearly

4

established that the presence of animus would be enough

5

to take ­­ to raise a constitutional ­­

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, do you agree with

7

that, Mr. Gershengorn?

8

hypotheticals in the last page of your brief where you

9

say that a complaint could survive a motion to dismiss

Because you have these

10

if the Secret Service members had, you know, announced,

11

had admitted that they had an intention to discriminate

12

or if they had told the local police that.

13

So I took what you were saying there to say,

14

if there is evidence of a very clear nature, that it was

15

all about animus and it was nothing about security, then

16

the complaint would survive.

17

MR. GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, I think

18

that the way we reconcile the two positions is the

19

following:

20

rationale, and it is animus, we agree that it would be

21

clearly established law that the officers could not have

22

taken ­­ the agents could not have taken responsibility

23

­­ could not have taken the actions.

objective reason that could have justified the action,

12

what should the outcome be there as a matter of law?

13

Forget clearly established.

14

MR. GERSHENGORN:

We don't think they've

15

stated a constitutional violation in that context.

However, what the Court did in Reichle ­­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't ­­ what does that

answer mean?

That means there is no

constitutional violation.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So you ­­ so you say that

22

any time there is an objective basis for the Secret

23

Service to act to move a protester, the fact that this

24

wasn't the motive at all, but that it was viewpoint

25

discrimination is irrelevant.

MR. GERSHENGORN:

MR. GERSHENGORN:

That is our position, but

I don't think that's what we need to win this case.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

I know that, but the reason

8

that you ­­ the reason I think these questions are being

9

asked, my impression is exactly what Justice Scalia said

10

in respect to a Fourth Amendment case against a police

11

stop.

12

But my impression also is that where you

13

have a First Amendment case and it's not against the

14

policeman, against Secret Service, this Court has not

15

said that.

16

Am I right about that?

And the reason that

17

your position, if I am right, is relevant is because I

18

think maybe we shouldn't say that for the first time in

19

a case where the government hasn't even argued it.

20

MR. GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, I ­­

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now ­­ and what is the

22

answer to what I just said?

Am I right on part one, and

am I right on part two?

MR. GERSHENGORN:

Your Honor, you are right

3

Court ­­ the closest the Court has come is in Reichle

4

where what the Court said was in a case of retaliatory

5

arrest, it was not clearly established ­­ the Court

6

didn't reach the constitutional question.

7

said it was not clearly established that where there was

8

objective probable cause for arrest, retaliatory animus

9

was not relevant.

10

The Court has never held it.

What the

The Court

We think a number of the same factors that

motivated the Court in Reichle could motivate the Court

here as well, were they to reach that question, and I'll

that question because it's not clearly established.

ordinary policemen.

MR. GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, I've been

2

asked the government's view on a couple of things, so I

3

want to be very clear.

4

The question of what is our position is the

5

position articulated by Justice Scalia.

6

what we need to win, it's qualified immunity.

7

The question of

The question of whether the Court should

8

reach the constitutional question, I think our answer

9

would be no, that the parties haven't breached it as

10

Your Honor said, that the normal course would be to do

11

what the Court said in Reichle and say that it's not

12

clearly established.

13

But ­­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I can't understand why you

14

didn't brief it then in that case.

15

why you didn't brief it.

16

things that we haven't ­­ haven't held in the past, we

17

haven't even held in the past that ­­ that there is a

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is that a

relevant ­­ well, what is your position on that?

3

pertinent in analyzing qualified immunity that there's

4

no private right of action for the asserted

5

constitutional violation?

6

MR. GERSHENGORN:

Is it

We do believe, Your Honor,

7

that it is ­­ it is ­­ the Court would have jurisdiction

8

to reach it because it's a logically antecedent question

9

and that it would be something that the Court could

10
11
12

consider.

It's not something ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But I don't mean

what the Court could consider.

13

MR. GERSHENGORN:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.
I want to know

15

whether or not ­­ well, the question is simple.

16

only ­­ can you not violate the Constitution if there's

17

no right of action against you, or do you look and say,

18

well, whether there's a right of action or not, it still

19

violates the Constitution?

20

MR. GERSHENGORN:

Can you

Your Honor, I think that

21

the presence of ­­ the Court's hesitant to recognize

22

Bivens and the factors that go into the ­­ that gave the

23

Court hesitance to extend Bivens to First Amendment

24

claims are relevant to the analysis here.

We didn't

because of some of the discussion we're having, that we

think the better view of the law would be if you have an

unconstitutional.

JUSTICE ALITO:

This question about the ­­

4

the issue that you've been addressing in response to

5

Justice Scalia's question.

6

Amendment context where it is purely ­­ the inquiry is

7

purely objective, we have case law on what is reasonable

8

suspicion, what is probable cause.

9

that to a First Amendment case where there ­­ where it's

In ­­ in the Fourth

Now, if you apply

10

asserted that there is a security ­­ there may or may

11

not be a security concern, would it not be necessary for

12

us to identify a ­­ a degree of suspicion or probable

13

cause that the Secret Service would have to have before

14

making ­­ before moving people for security reasons?

15

I imagine whenever the President is out in

16

public, there is some degree of risk.

17

You know, keep him in a bunker.

18

you see what I'm saying?

19

MR. GERSHENGORN:

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

You want no risk?

So at some point ­­ do

They ­­
I do, Your Honor.
The Secret Service has to

21

make a decision about how much information they need

22

before they can ­­ they should move people or change a

23

route or something like that.

24

have to set that standard.

25

MR. GERSHENGORN:

So the courts would then

Your Honor, I think it

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would have to be a very deferential standard and it

2

would ­­ and I think that that is proper under this

3

Court's case law.

4

If I could attack that in sort of two ways.

5

The way the Court addressed this issue in Reichle we

6

think is quite parallel to how it would address it in

7

this First Amendment context.

8

Reichle was:

9

that case is likely to be an issue in every ­­ in

What the Court said in

First, the existence of probable cause in

10

virtually every case.

11

the existence of a legitimate objective security

12

rationale, in part because that's what the agents do and

13

in part because of statute that ­­ that requires the

14

agency to protect the President, a legitimate security

15

rationale is likely to be in every case first.

16

And we think in this situation,

Second, what the Court said in Reichle was

17

that it's very difficult to distinguish animus from the

18

proper use of reliance on protected speech because ­­

19

because the Court has recognized that it is valid at

20

times to take into account the nature of one's speech

21

in ­­ in making arrests and other security decisions.

22

And the same would be true here.

23

And we think there's a third factor here

24

which is important, which this Court has recognized,

25

that the physical security of the President occupies a

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

special place in our constitutional structure, as

2

Justice Breyer put it in his Rubin dissent, and that the

3

all, there's a very big difference between whether

15

there's a Bivens action stated and whether there are

other ways to enforce constitutional rights.

injunctive and declaratory relief before things like

they're annoying the President; let's do it right now,

MR. GERSHENGORN:

I think, Your Honor, that

at some point you would cross over into a position where

6

you would say there ­­ there is a real question about

7

whether there's an objective security rationale and we

8

would be in a situation ­­

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, there is one.

I mean,

10

there is one in a sense of as we look back, we can see

11

that there's an alleyway and that somebody could have a

12

grenade, but there is evidence that that's not at all

13

what was in the heads of the Secret Service members.

14

MR. GERSHENGORN:

Your Honor, I recognize

15

that that is ­­ as I said, I think that is a ­­ that is

16

the ­­ the hardest case for us and I recognize that's

17

why Your Honor posed it.

18

about from the flip side, which is if you adopted the

19

rule that Your Honor's question would ­­ not attributing

20

to you, but might lead one to adopt, that the result is

21

an agent who has a legitimate security rationale but is

22

operating against people who are expressing a viewpoint

must hesitate.

Your Honor, very briefly,

unconstitutional; and that under Iqbal, that the

MR. WILKER:

issue that's presented to this Court for decision today.

5

We're ­­ this is not a case in which the Secret Service

6

made a split­second judgment as to which evacuation

7

route to take with the President.

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

Well, but with

respect, my point is that we do have to adopt a general

10

principle, and if we say viewpoint can never be a

11

consideration, then you have to say when there is an

12

emergency going on, it's just as likely there will be a

13

problem if we go through the pro­Bush demonstrators or

14

the anti ones, which seems to me to be, on its face,

15

implausible.

16

MR. WILKER:

Well, in the context of an

17

emergency, there may be a different rule than there

18

would be in the context of a considered decision to take

19

viewpoint into account in making a decision, which is

20

what we have alleged here.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So then you think

22

there ­­ well, there may be situations in which

23

viewpoint alone may be a security consideration.

24
25

MR. WILKER:

There may be.

And I think if

there were individuals directly in proximity to the

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

President, not, you know, 90 feet or 80 feet away, but

2

directly, could the Secret Service take into account, I

3

think that's what this Court said in Reichle, is that

4

the Court can into account where it said in the

5

proximity of the President, or in that case the Vice

6

President.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Wilker, do you concede

8

that, looking back on this just in a hindsight kind of way,

9

that there is an objective security rationale here, that

10

they are standing at the foot of the alleyway, that you

11

could throw a grenade into the patio area?

12

concede that just looking at the situation and not

13

thinking, not taking into account any evidence of what

14

was in their heads, that there in fact is an objective

15

security rationale for moving people from this area?

16

MR. WILKER:

Do you

I think if you ­­ if the

17

concern was the mouth of the alley and that the riot

18

geared police guarding the mouth of the alley were not

19

sufficient to protect the alley and protect against that

20

kind of incursion, the more simple solution in this case

21

would simply be to move people slightly to the east or

22

west where they had buildings between them and the

23

President.

11

government saying, yes, that is clearly established,

12

that they could not in fact be motivated only by bad

13

viewpoint reasons and zero by security, and therefore,

14

you have stated a claim, if your complaint does say what

15

we both just agreed you wanted to say.

didn't and I have to decide that.

Okay.

Then I would have to

23

decide is it the case that if the Secret ­­ if the

Now, we’d running into the Bivens problem, et cetera.

2

But leaving all that out of it, the next

3

question would be, which I haven't heard argued yet,

4

which is why I raised this, what more do you have to do

5

than state a claim?

6

nothing, that if you have an absurd claim, I'm not

7

saying it's absurd, but if it were absurd, a district

8

court could deal with that.

giving you 5 minutes of discovery and then saying hum,

5 years ago, I would have thought

They would deal with it by

or 10 minutes plus summary judgment.

Or you know, they have five or six different

13

weapons.

Now, that is what you're arguing, I think.

14

But then along comes Iqbal.

15

MR. WILKER:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17
18

Or have you really

Are you kidding?

Be

Uh­huh.
Now, it's a long way of

focusing you on that question.
MR. WILKER:

And so in Iqbal, this Court

19

said to be plausible it has to be something more than

20

possible.

21

And the way we establish intent is rarely through the

22

admission to a local law enforcement or to someone else

23

that the agent acted for an impermissible reason.

24
25

But it ­­ plausibility is not probability.

What we do to establish intent is plead
facts from which intent can be inferred.

37
Alderson Reporting Company

We believe we

Official

1

have pled ­­ pleaded facts from which intent can be

2

inferred, both with respect to the disparate treatment,

3

with respect to the time that elapsed from the

4

President's decision to dine, from the time he sat down,

5

and then 15 more minutes until the decision was made to

6

move the demonstrators.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, Iqbal says a

8

little bit more than that, not that you just have to

9

allege facts.

In Iqbal, and just quoting here from page

10

681, the Court goes on to consider the factual

11

allegations in the complaint to determine if they

12

plausibly suggest an entitlement, and they go on to say,

13

but given more likely explanations, they do not

14

plausibly establish this purpose.

15

So based on just your complaint, we have to

16

determine whether there are more likely explanations.

17

And we have in your complaint the idea that they are at

18

the front of the alleyway, it's a six­foot wooden fence.

19

Can we ­­ we certainly can look at those in deciding not

20

simply whether you've pled the cause of action, but

21

whether it's more plausible than those other

22

justifications.

23

MR. WILKER:

I think, though, once we meet a

24

certain threshold of plausibility, unless the competing

25

inference is so compelling to make our claim

38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

implausible, that it involves at the pleading stage such

2

a great burden that no plaintiff could ever satisfy it.

3

The Secret Service or any defendant could always ­­

4

could always articulate some rationale for their action

5

that would create a competing inference.

17

really bad, let's get these people out of the way?

Could a reasonable officer have said that?

MR. WILKER:

Could a reasonable officer have

20

said that, that given the proximity?

22

impossible conclusion.

Certainly that's a

I can't say that that's an

23

But the answer to that ­­ it doesn't,

24

because the answer to that is to take a measured

25

response consistent with the Secret Service's own

39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

guidelines, which is not to take viewpoint into account,

2

to be respectful of those First Amendment rights of

3

people who are demonstrating on the public streets in

4

the center of town.

5

This is core.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And have you ­­ you've

6

conceded that there would be a security interest, in the

7

hypothetical that Justice Kagan raised, that there are

8

­­ people are in front of that alley where they could

9

throw a grenade.

Once you concede that, then you say,

10

but the security interest, the valid security interest

11

is washed away because, in fact, it was reported.

12

MR. WILKER:

I think there's a distinction.

13

Could there be a security interest?

14

hypothetically be one.

15

not, for the reasons articulated in our briefs and for

16

the constellation of facts that we have alleged in our

17

complaint.

18

Yes, there could

Was there one?

JUSTICE KAGAN:

We say there was

I'm not sure I understand

19

that, because it seems to me there either is or isn't a

20

valid security interest.

21

because of that valid security interest is, of course, a

22

different question, and you might say, well, there was a

23

valid security interest, but that's not why they acted.

24

But as to the first question, I mean, there

Would he clear this area or not?

MR. WILKER:

The ­­ the question is whether

5

proximity alone of a peaceful group of protesters is

6

enough to create a security; and in hindsight, you could

7

look at that and you could conclude that.

8

respectfully disagree that that means there was one on

9

the evening in question.

10

Was there, in fact ­­

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

I

That's a factual question.

You say in your complaint,

12

"The Defendants claim that Defendant Secret Service

13

agents told Tao and the police defendants that the

14

reason for the Secret Service's request or direction was

15

that they did not want anyone within handgun or

17

agents, in fact, made such an assertion, the assertion

position that not moving them back before the President

8

left was a violation of their First Amendment rights?

9

MR. WILKER:

So leaving aside

We have not taken that

10

position.

there was an obligation to hold the President in

position so that the demonstrators could be moved back

to their former position.

security reason and that the reason they were moved was

And the fact that that's not a separate claim that they

19

weren't moved back, but it is an indication that they

were removed from where the President would be passing,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. GERSHENGORN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice:
A couple of points.

First, I think, Justice

15

Kagan, in response to your hypothetical, the concession

16

that in hindsight there may have been a valid security

17

rationale ends this case, because if it was true in

18

hindsight, it was certainly true at the time in the kind

19

of rapid ­­ in the kind of rapid decision­making that was

20

called for, as the Chief Justice alluded to.

21

that point the case is over in our favor.

12

MR. GERSHENGORN:

Your Honor, I think that

13

would be a much more difficult case in the context of a

14

motorcade where the security of the President is much

15

different than when the President is on an outdoor patio

16

separated only by a small fence.

17

that is one of the major differences between where

20

that could be based on differential treatment because

the pro­Bush protesters were in position to see the

22

motorcade when it left, and therefore, as the complaint

23

alleges in Paragraph 55, that that somehow undermines

24

the agents' security rationale for moving the anti­Bush
