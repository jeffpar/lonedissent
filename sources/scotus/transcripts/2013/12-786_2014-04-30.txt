ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON M. PANNER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. PANNER:

10

please the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

precedence answer the question that is properly before

14

infringement under Section 271(b) unless the defendant

15

­­ defendant has deliberately brought about actionable

16

direct infringement under Section 271(a).

17

conclusion is strongly reinforced by the principle that

18

the patent laws best promote the legitimate interests of

19

inventors, of the innovative community, and the public

20

when rules and boundaries are clear.

There is no liability for indirect

And that

22

between conduct that invades a patentee's exclusive

23

rights and conduct that gives rise to secondary or

24

indirect liability.

refused to blur those statutory lines simply because a

3

adjustments as it did, for example, in response to this

4

Court's decision in Deepsouth.

5

critically important for the scope of patent claims to

6

be clear so that the public has clear notice of the

7

patentee's exclusive rights and as between a patentee

8

who can choose the language to embody the invention and

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Panner, is this ­­ is

MR. PANNER:

That's exactly right, Your

Honor.

method patents have, in some ways, more restricted

6

rights associated with them.

7

make a method or sell a method, but you ­­ you use a

8

method by carrying out each and every step of that

9

method.

And ­­ and, of course, it's ­­ it's true that

It's hard to ­­ you don't

And it's very well­established and it's one

10

reflection of the all elements rule, which is, again,

11

very old, that one doesn't have infringement unless all

12

the ­­ all the steps of the patent are carried out.

13

Now, that's the rule that the Federal

14

Circuit applied in finding that there was no

15

infringement ­­ direct infringement under Section

16

271(a).

17

this point because it was the subject of a

18

cross­petition that has not been granted.

MR. PANNER:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

2

In ­­ in the following ­­ in ­­ in two following senses.

3

First of all, empirically speaking, there have not been

4

very many cases in which this has proven to be a

5

problem.

6

principle of patent claim drafting that method claims

7

should be drafted from the point of view of a potential

8

infringer so that all of the steps can be carried out by

9

that potential infringer.

It has been a long ­­ long understood

And prospectively,

10

certainly ­­ and given that this rule has been clearly

11

articulated by the Federal Circuit now for many years,

12

or at least several years, prospectively, the patent

13

applicant has every incentive to draft claims from the

14

point of view of a single potential infringer.

15

This ­­ the claim that's at issue here,

16

there's no dispute.

17

a way that the steps would have been carried out by a

18

single infringer and, indeed, that may have been the

19

intent.

It could have been written in such

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but it would

22

be ­­ when you say it would be written that way, it

23

would be by not claiming one step in the method, I

24

assume, which changes the whole patent.

25

MR. PANNER:

Well, it would be ­­ it would

be to claim what is carried out from the point of view

of the potential infringer.

So, for example, in this

really in every patent whether the tagging is an

9

important part of the process or not.

Honor, the ­­ every step is material and important to

1

for example, between cellular phones and networks and

content providers who are sending content to a phone,

3

for example, it is very common to draft claims from the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is that what the briefs

are talking about as a single actor rule?
MR. PANNER:

Yeah.

It would ­­ it's

10

referred to sometimes as a single entity rule.

11

that's a little bit of a misnomer because, of course,

12

there could be multiple people involved with the alleged

13

infringement in a circumstance where the acts of one

14

actor are attributable to the principal, under

15

principles of vicarious liability.

16

that this inducement theory is not available to us, we

3

think that there is a real problem here, that there is a

4

kind of end run around the patent law and so we're going

5

to change what we think on the 271(a) question, if they

did that, would be right to say it would render our

20

for any case if the Federal Circuit on remand goes the

21

opposite way in a ­­ on the 271(a) question.

22

I'm not thinking more broadly enough.

23

MR. PANNER:

But maybe

I don't think so, Your Honor,

24

because if ­­ if the Court were to keep ­­ if the Court

25

were to maintain that rule ­­ if the Court were to

13
Alderson Reporting Company

1

affirm the rule that the Federal Circuit articulated,

3

potentially provide an avenue for claims of induced

4

infringement and circumstances where on some

hypothetical new joint infringement doctrine under

6

Section 271(a), there might not be a claim.

7

So in other words ­­

8

couldn't think of a place where somebody would make the

circumstances where Section 271(a) would still ­­ still

not apply and there might be an argument that, depending

14

on what the more ­­ we're talking about a hypothetical

15

271(a) rule that's broader, and we don't know what it

16

would look like and so whether that would leave room for

17

271(b).

18

It is certainly correct that if this Court

19

were to say there is no indirect liability under Section

20

271(b), as we would urge the Court to do, without direct

21

infringement under 271(a), that resolves this question.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I suppose, Mr. Panner,

10

what might make this a little bit different is that

11

notwithstanding what you said about 10 of 11 judges, it

12

was clear that the judges thought that there was a real

13

problem here in terms of an end run, and that they

14

looked at this and said, well we could do it under

15

271(a) or we could do it under 271(b), and 271(b) seems

16

a lot more natural and better for various reasons.

17

your sense in reading the opinion that all those judges

18

who did it under 271(b) are just going to go back and do

19

the exact same thing under 271(a).

But

20

MR. PANNER:

21

with that, Your Honor.

22

liability under 271(a) would actually be somewhat of a

disaster for the innovative community because of the

16

The Federal Circuit's holding that a party

17

may be liable for inducing infringement under Section

18

271(b), even though no one has committed direct

19

infringement, is wrong for two primary reasons.

20

Section 271(b)'s text makes clear that to be liable for

21

inducement, a party must induce conduct that constitutes

22

direct infringement under 271(a).

23

in expanding 271(b), the Federal Circuit departed from

24

liability, but this Court has twice held in both

Is that ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes.

Exactly.

19
Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

And I thought

2

the reason ­­ you have to answer it ­­ is because when

3

you have many steps in a process, and this is a very

4

similar process of the book I'm reading now about the

5

Seabees building constructions in World War II, you

6

know, they put some forward warehouses and they put some

7

other stuff in some other warehouses and they make the

8

eventual thing by shipping this from over there and the

9

other place.

10

So it's tough.

Now, you’ll probably want to insist upon a

11

pretty strict relationship between the different parties

12

in a joint venture or more before you hold them liable.

13

In other words, there's an issue I don't know about.

14

How close was this relationship?

15

because you're going to answer his question and I want

16

to just see if my stab in the dark here is somewhere

17

close to the ­­ to what you were about to say.

18

MS. ANDERS:

And I ask you that

Well, I think that's right,

19

Justice Breyer.

20

problem under 271(a), which, again, is not the question

21

before the Court, but if you do, what everyone agrees, I

22

think, is that you can use traditional, well­established

23

tort principles of attribution in order to conclude that

24

someone who has not personally performed all the steps

25

of a process, nonetheless, should be liable for using

I think if you look at this as a

the process because they have worked in concert with

2

someone else.

3

I think everyone agrees on that.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but that is not the

4

tort rule for what this is, which is an absolute

5

liability.

6

The policy reason is someone who does not even know

7

about the existence of the ­­ of the patent, who happens

8

to be one of the people who ­­ who performs one or more

9

of the ­­ of the steps is suddenly automatically liable.

I mean, you asked for the policy reason.

10

That's ­­ that's the policy reason.

liability tort.

12

MS. ANDERS:

It's a strict

reason that we ­­ I think we would all agree that ­­

that if you had two unrelated parties who each happen to

use some steps of a process, happened to perform some

16

steps, unbeknownst to each other, we wouldn't say that

17

those people had used the process in any reasonable

construction of the term.

principles to incorporate in 271(a).

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Wait a minute, I think under

4

Justice Scalia's example, they're not liable today,

5

because if they're ­­ if they're on the method patent,

6

someone has to practice the four steps, and they have to

7

be vicariously liable, correct?

8
9

MS. ANDERS:

Well, I think the rule is that

you either have to practice all of the steps yourself ­­

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

MS. ANDERS:

­­ or you have to have them

12

attributed to you under traditional tort principles of

13

attribution.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Right.

Exactly.

The Federal Circuit has said

16

principal agent right now.

17

think everyone agrees that that rule, at least, is

18

correct.

19

would have to consider, I think, the significant concern

20

about expanding liability too far so that you have

21

parties who don't know about the patent, who don't know

22

exactly what steps they need to perform or avoid

23

performing in order to avoid liability.

24
25

That rule makes sense.

I

3

there's no infringement in the first place.

4

a very strong argument.

5

under 271(b) rather than under 271(a) is because of what

6

Justice Scalia said, that 271(b) is not a strict

liability offense, and so that you can say, you have to

know and you have to have instructed the ­­ the person.

1

So it turned to 271(b).

2

Justice Scalia said, is that it's very clear from the

3

text of the statute that the conduct induced has to be

4

direct infringement.

The problem with 271(b), as

5

And I think the Court has twice before

that what ­­ what the defendant was trying to do was

11

The first is that, as we've been discussing,

the ­­ the content and application of well­established

disagreement about what the content of those doctrines

17

are and how they would apply here, which would, I think,

18

need to be decided by looking at treaties, state law,

19

how these doctrines have been applied.

20

271(a) turns on what

think is that these tort doctrines, properly applied, we

sort that courts have looked for when they've looked at

There is no agreement to circumvent the

2

think ­­ you know, although one of the most ­­ the

pressing policy concern, I think, it addressed or raised

4

by the other side's amici is this idea of two people

5

agreeing to circumvent a patent.

6

So I

I don't think that situation can easily be

7

resolved here because we have a vendor­customer

situation here, and so I think the Court could, I think,

9

resolve that question in a future case.

And the final thing I ­­

It's hard to give a very

concrete example, but I think patents that involve the

use of ­­ of different machines that have to be operated

23

even if you draft patents from the perspective of a

You had a third

point you were going to make on 271(a)?

The third point was just

7

something that I think we already alluded to a little

8

bit, which is that, when the Court is deciding what ­­

9

what tort doctrines to import into 271(a), I think

10

there's a lot of reason for caution because if ­­ if you

was trying to make in response to Justice Kennedy's

question.

19

This case is not complicated.

This case

20

involves a four­ or five­step method in which Limelight

21

performs all but one or two of the steps and tells its

customers, if you want to use our service, you have to

perform the other step.

you would affirm here on 271(b) grounds or (a) grounds,

the result will be exactly the same.

2

expanding the relief that we are requesting this Court

3

to grant, because even if you just affirm on (b), just

4

say the Federal Circuit was right, either because it's

5

theory is right or because we think that the common law

6

attribution rules are broader than the Court ­­ the

7

panel previously had thought, the result is going to be

8

a remand to decide a quest ­­ the question of

9

infringement under 154(1) and 271(a) because there ­­ as

10

they ­­ as Limelight points out like on every third page

of its briefs, there is an unresolved pending appellate

12

challenge to the jury's finding that Limelight's

customers, in fact, practiced the tagging step.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

with you about what Rosemond ­­ the Rosemond opinion

But let me take a valiant step in any event.

What this Court said was that from the

10

perspective ­­ and ­­ and the two treatises that this

11

Court cited also say this ­­ from the perspective of the

12

victim, which is the perspective that the Court used in

13

the example and is the perspective that the common law

14

of torts takes, there was an encroachment upon rights.

15

Now, what this Court said in its discussion is none of

16

those four people are liable for kidnapping as a

17

principal, but they are all liable under the common plan

18

analysis for indirect liability.

19

what is really most notable about the common law is ­­

20

and the early patent cases ­­ is how assiduously, going

21

back at least through the 19th Century, the courts

22

worked to make sure that where there was an invasion of

23

the property or personal right, either in criminal law

24

or in civil tort law, that parties that cooperated with

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Waxman, what ­­ what ­­ what your argument just

5

glides over is that you need the infringement.

question is whether, under substantive law, you have the
