ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON

11

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MS. HARRINGTON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
In this case, the Eleventh Circuit

12

unambiguously held that a district court always abuses

13

its discretion when it denies a summons opponent's

14

request to examine IRS officials based on an unsupported

15

allegation of improper purpose.

16

for at least three reasons, and even Respondents don't

17

defend it at this point.

18

That holding was wrong

The three reasons are:

First, the Eleventh

19

Circuit's rule ignores Congress's intent that IRS

20

summons enforcement proceedings be summary in nature.

21

Second, the automatic examination rule is inconsistent

22

with this Court's treatment of analogous,

23

administrative, and grand jury subpoenas in other

24

contexts.

25

district courts' core discretion to govern its own

And the third, the rule fails to respect the

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

proceedings, including governing when and how evidence

2

should be developed.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

As you say, the Respondent

4

concedes all that.

5

about what the difference is between you and the

6

Respondent?

7

here, right?

8
9

So why don't ­­ why don't you talk

Nobody defends what the lower court said

MS. HARRINGTON:

I'm happy to.

The

Respondent suggests two what we think of as unworkable

10

limitations or potential limitations on the rule.

11

first is that there be a requirement that the allegation

12

be plausible, though, totally unsupported by evidence.

13

And in our view, any plausibility requirement that is

14

untethered to a requirement that a summons opponent

15

actually point to some evidence that would substantiate

16

the allegation is really not a limitation at all.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The

Is ­­ is there really a

18

difference between those two?

19

there is ­­ if there is no evidence that suggests that

20

it's true?

21

MS. HARRINGTON:

Can it be plausible if

Well, in our view, no.

I

22

mean, I think that's the question that you might want to

23

direct to Respondents.

24
25

They seem to suggest that ­­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It may well be that the two

of you agree in other words, depending on what they

4
Alderson Reporting Company

2

think.
MS. HARRINGTON:

And if that's true, then we

3

invite the Court to reverse the Eleventh Circuit.

4

mean, the rule we want ­­

5

(Laughter.)

6

MS. HARRINGTON:

I

What we would like is that

7

there ­­ that before a district court is actually

8

required to allow examination of IRS officials, a

9

summons opponent has to put in enough evidence to at

10
11

least raise an inference of ­­
JUSTICE ALITO:

It all depends on what ­­ it

12

all depends on what you mean by "evidence."

13

direct evidence?

14

Do you mean

Is circumstantial evidence enough?

MS. HARRINGTON:

Circumstantial evidence is

15

enough.

16

really a modest rule.

17

has discretion to allow examination of an IRS official.

18

And ­­ and, again, what we're asking for is
A district court, in our view,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Could you ­­ could you

19

apply your rule, district court discretion in this

20

particular case?

21

that ­­ the first one was that the ­­ this was in

22

retaliation for the taxpayers' refusal for the third

23

time to extend the limitation period.

24

this was an effort to circumvent the limited discovery

25

that's allowed in the tax court.

There were two allegations, I think,

5
Alderson Reporting Company

And the other was

Official

1

Now, those were the allegations.

What would

2

the taxpayer have to say in addition to those two

3

allegations to pass your test?

4

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, so I think there ­­

5

there are sort of two threshold questions that the

6

district court would consider.

7

those would actually be improper purposes.

8

second is whether if they would be, they were actually

9

the motivating purposes in this case.

The first is whether
And the

The district

10

court ­­ the court of appeals in this case only

11

considered the statute of limitations question, and it

12

found that ­­ that issuing a summonses after a taxpayer

13

declined to extend a statute of limitations would be an

14

improper purpose.

15

but that's not the question on which we sought this

16

Court's review ­­

17

We disagree with that legal holding,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, let ­­ let's assume

18

that it is inappropriate for the IRS to avoid

19

taxpayer ­­ tax court limitations on discovery.

20

assume that a subpoena cannot do that.

21

declaration, it seems to me, is quite sufficient to make

22

that showing.

23

MS. HARRINGTON:

Let's

The Supinski

Well, I would just say ­­

24

so there's a case we cited in our reply brief called Ash

25

v. Commissioner, which is a tax court case, which says

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that in the tax's court view, there's no problem with

2

enforcing a summons that was issued before

3

proceedings were initiated, as was the case here, that

4

there's no problem ­­ there's no interference with the

5

tax court discovery rule when we need to do that.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

tax court

But my supposition was

7

that assume that you cannot avoid taxpayer ­­ or tax

8

court discovery limits.

9

to me the Supinski affidavit is quite sufficient.

10

If ­­ if that is so, it seems

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, it may or may not be.

11

And, again, if this Court corrects the ­­ the Eleventh

12

Circuit didn't consider that because in the Eleventh

13

Circuit's view, there didn't need to be any evidence.

14

And so the Eleventh Circuit did not examine the

15

sufficiency of the evidence that the Respondents

16

presented.

17

rule, Respondents can make these arguments on remand to

18

the Eleventh Circuit.

And so if this Court corrects that legal

19

But I would just point out with respect to

20

that ­­ that proposed improper purpose that the ­­ the

21

validity of a summons is judged at the time that the

22

summons was issued.

23

were issued before there was any tax court litigation.

24

There's always the possibility, when a summons is

25

issued, that there's going to be tax court litigation

MS. HARRINGTON:

Absolutely.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You don't want us to

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, you can easily

11

imagine circumstances where there's a subpoena, an

12

administrative subpoena issued against Mr. Smith.

13

the time he comes around to enforcing it, where there's

14

very little reason to enforce it, Mr. Smith is suffering

15

an incurable disease and the district court would say,

16

no, it's oppressive.

of this rule that you ­­ a district court would be

18

forbidden to look at the circumstances in which the ­­ a

19

subpoena or any other discovery document is being asked

20

21

from that the district court can't look at the

22

circumstances now?

Right?

JUSTICE BREYER:

Very well.

that, they've asked this question on the merits here.

4

have they asked this enforcement?

5

possible reasons.

6

years 2005, 2007 that would show that they owe more

7

money than you claim they do owe, since you issued a

8

final thing, which would be impossible because the

9

statute of limitations has run.

10

There are only two

One is to get some information in the

And the other possible reason is that you want to

11

obtain information to put in the tax court proceeding,

12

which, in fact, is supported by the fact that the agents

13

who came to enforce it were tax court lawyers and not

14

the regular lawyers.

15

absolutely illegal under the law ­­ the rules of the

16

tax court.

17

That's why we think this is oppressive.

18

response to that is if they're wrong, why do you want

19

this information?

20
21
22

And, in fact, it would be

So they said, that's our information.

MS. HARRINGTON:

And your

Well, we think they're sort

JUSTICE BREYER:

Very good.

Then you will

explain to me why is it ­­ why is it that the government

wants this information?

To do what?

MS. HARRINGTON:

Because so ­­ just to take

whether the summonses were issued for a proper purpose.

3

This Court said in Couch that the legal parties ­­ the

4

parties' legal duties are fixed at the time that the

5

summons was issued.

6

approach that they're asking for, what you're going to

7

do is give taxpayers an incentive not to comply with the

8

legal duty that's imposed on them by operation of law,

9

which is to disclose information related to their tax

The courts have upheld that the inquiry is

16

You give them incentive to drag

JUSTICE BREYER:

My question was:

Why do

you want the information?
MS. HARRINGTON:

We want the information

because the IRS wants to make a determination of their

tax liability.

information ­­
MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, that's a ­­ that's

one possibility.
JUSTICE BREYER:

I want to know yes or no.

What are the reasons you want this information?

One is

10

you want to change the number on the final partnership

11

assessment of liability.

Is that one of the reasons?

12

MS. HARRINGTON:

It could be.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes or no, please.

14

MS. HARRINGTON:

We want the right answer.

15

And if the right answer is that we were wrong in the

16

FPAA, then we would revise the FPAA.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

You want ­­ in other words,

18

I want to be quite precise.

I've asked the question, do

you want the information with the idea in mind that it

might show you should change the final number?

MS. HARRINGTON:

Right.
And so that may ­­ that

might not be a proper purpose because the IRS has said

you need extraordinary circumstances ­­ the internal IRS

guidelines say you need extraordinary circumstances to

And the Tax Court has similarly said you can

extraordinary circumstances.

a summons is issued long before or at least somewhat

figure out whether we're in the Iqbal­Twombly world,

government and said:

I would have done what Justice Breyer did.

19

would have figured out and asked you enough questions,

20

without holding a hearing, just through your attorney,

23

sense or not.

MS. HARRINGTON:

And absolutely, we would

3

say you would have discretion to do that as the district

court.

5

district court's discretion here.

6

important to keep in mind, another reason that the Iqbal

7

standard really doesn't work here is that by the time

8

you're getting to this question about whether there's an

9

Alderson Reporting Company

1

That's exactly the standard that we think should have

3

a summons opponent, can do that, can point to facts that

court needs to allow examination of IRS ­­

should have a hearing at which the taxpayer gets an

testimony just in that case.

5

that as a rule to govern all cases.

6

just about any allegation of improper purpose.

about a particular type of purpose that was ­­ that was

8

relevant then, which is that an allegation that the IRS

9

had a criminal investigation only purpose.

I don't think we offered
But also, it wasn't
It was

And when

10

Congress enacted TEFRA in 1982, it took that allegation

11

of improper purpose off the table by sort of drawing ­­

12

making irrelevant whether the IRS ­­ whatever its

13

internal motivation was, whether it was looking at

14

criminal or civil liability, it took that off the table.

15

And so all the courts of appeals from the

16

'70s and '80s that allowed examination of IRS officials,

17

as a matter of course or more frequently, all of those

18

courts of appeals except the Eleventh Circuit changed

19

their rule after TEFRA was enacted because all of those

20

holdings were really just about whether the IRS had a

10

MR. MAROD:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Did you ask ­­ I mean,

12

that would be a possibility.

You're saying that once

13

the case shifts to the Tax Court, it should be the Tax

14

Court judgment, not a district court reviewing the

15

subpoena.

16

MR. MAROD:

Correct.

We're saying ­­

I understand.

We can't ask the

17

Tax Court to not enforce the summonses, because Congress

18

has given exclusive jurisdiction to enforce or not

19

enforce summonses to the district court and, in fact,

20

the Ash case that Ms. Harrington referenced actually

21

held, we don't have jurisdiction to determine whether

22

these should be enforced or shouldn't be enforced.

23

they go ahead and allow them to be enforced and the

information is gathered, we will then consider the

information to make its own determination about that.

And in this case, the IRS didn't have enough

10

And so what it decided was the taxpayer hadn't met its

11

burden, and it issued the FPAA.

12

to take that protective step if the ­­ if the taxpayer

13

is refusing to turn over information.

And the IRS is entitled

14

Now, Respondents sort of pointed to several

15

questions that they might want to ask the IRS agent who

16

issued the summons.

17

relevant to the purpose for issuing the summons.

18

they just go to the purpose for enforcing the summons.

19

Those questions are clearly not

And just one last point on Iqbal.

Again,

We really

20

don't think Iqbal applies here, because in this ­­ in

21

this instance, what you are talking about is you already

22

have a showing by the IRS that it has a proper purpose.

23

And a district court is not going to issue an order to

24

show cause unless the district court is satisfied that

25

the IRS has established a proper purpose.

And so the presumptions shift, are the

2

opposite of Iqbal in that context.

3

there's a presumption that the IRS has a proper purpose.

And this Court said in the LaSalle National Bank case

5

that then the duty is on the summons opponent to

disprove a proper purpose.

entitled to a presumption that what they say is correct.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

In that context,

And so the opponent isn't

So could you say a little

bit more, Ms. Harrington, about what ­­ what kind of

10

evidence would overcome the presumption in a particular

11

case?

12

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, so this Court

13

identified in Powell two potential improper purposes:

14

One would be harassment and one is an attempt to kind of

15

leverage a settlement in a collateral matter.

16

think to take the second one, if the IRS were really

17

trying to pressure a taxpayer into settling a collateral

18

matter, the IRS would have some evidence of that;

19

otherwise, it would be a pretty ineffective attempt to

20

leverage a settlement.

21

communications from the IRS or something like that, and

22

the taxpayer can submit affidavits or any kind of

23

documentary evidence that's in the taxpayer's possession

24

or the summons recipient's position to the district

25

court and then the district court has discretion if it

And I

So they're going to have some
