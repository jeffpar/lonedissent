ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD R. DIETZ

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DIETZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In 2009, Bruce Abramski went to a gun store

11

at his home in Virginia and purchased a firearm.

12

he did so, he filled out all the required Federal

13

paperwork providing his own name and identifying

14

information and passing a background check.

15

When

He then traveled to his uncle's home in

16

Pennsylvania and delivered the firearm to a licensed gun

17

dealer there.

18

uncle to fill out the exact same Federal paperwork and

19

pass his own background check before taking possession

20

of the firearm.

21

That gun dealer required Mr. Abramski's

But despite doing precisely what Congress

22

established as the process to buy a firearm, intending

23

to sell or give it to a lawful gun owner in another

24

State, the government charged Mr. Abramski with falsely

25

stating that he was the actual buyer of the firearm when

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

he acquired it.

2

And that term, "actual" ­­

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What would happen if two

4

people walk into the gun store, one person hands the

5

money to the other and says, buy me that gun?

6

MR. DIETZ:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8
9

Yes, Your Honor.
Is that not actionable,

according to your theory?
MR. DIETZ:

Your Honor, the circumstance

10

where there are two lawful gun owners, that is

11

permissible.

12

is to consider the government's concession that in that

13

hypothetical, if the two people walked into the gun

14

store and the person looked and said, I'd like that gun

15

and points to the counter and then the person

16

standing ­­

17

20

And I think a good way to illustrate that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What's ­­ what's

truthful about saying you're the buyer ­­
JUSTICE SCALIA:
saying.

Please finish what you were

I ­­ I didn't understand what your point was.

21

MR. DIETZ:

22

In that circumstance, if the person standing

23

at the counter then says, I'd like to buy that firearm,

24

that the person indicated, I'm going to give it to that

25

person, then even the government concedes that in that

Yes, Your Honor.

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

circumstance, everything about that sale is perfectly

2

lawful and the buyer can take the gun, hand it to that

3

person standing next to them, who would leave the gun

4

store with the gun dealer and the government having

5

absolutely no idea who that person is or where the gun

6

is going.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm sorry.

So you're saying

8

that in that case, the gun dealer runs the background

9

check on the person who hands the gun dealer the credit

10

card as opposed to the person who will be the actual

11

recipient of the gun?

12

statute requires?

13

MR. DIETZ:

Is that what you're saying the

That's correct, Your Honor.

I

14

think the government concedes that as well in gift

15

circumstance at least, and there's certainly nothing in

16

the Gun Control Act that suggests that Congress was

17

distinguishing between those two circumstances at all.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, in the gift ­­ in the

19

gift situation.

20

information from the buyer, whatever that means; right?

But Congress requires certain

21

MR. DIETZ:

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

23

Yes, Your Honor.
The ­­ the dealer has to

record the name of the buyer; right?

24

MR. DIETZ:

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes, Your Honor.
And the address of the

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

buyer?

2

4

MR. DIETZ:

Yes, sir.

JUSTICE ALITO:

And do an instant check on

the buyer?

5

MR. DIETZ:

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes, Your Honor.
Now, why would ­­ why would this

7

Congress have wanted those things with respect to the

8

person who was just the straw purchaser and not the

9

person who ­­ the person who's actually going to acquire the

10

weapon?

11

MR. DIETZ:

The reason, Your Honor, is that

12

this legislation, the way Congress designed it, is not

13

focused on sort of the end point.

14

about where a gun is actually going, who's ultimately

15

going to receive it.

It's not concerned

16

What Congress was concerned about was the

17

starting point because, as part of the key political

18

compromise of the Gun Control Act, there were two

19

competing interests that needed to be accommodated.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why wouldn't they be

21

concerned about the starting point?

22

man, Mr. Straw, and he holds himself out as a gun buyer, he

23

puts ­­ you know, a website, he creates a website.

24

something in the Yellow Pages under "Straw Man."

25

says:

Let's say there's a

He puts
And he

You want to acquire a gun and you don't want the

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

dealer to record your name and you don't want to have an

2

instant check on you, you come to me.

3

And so these people come to him, and

4

whenever they do, he goes to Joe's gun shop and ­­ with

5

the other person.

6

this fellow with me is going to do all the talking.

7

the guy who's with him talks with Joe about different

8

types of guns, costs and everything.

He says, I want to buy a gun, but
So

9

After that's done, the person who's done all

10

the talking says, now, my friend, Mr. Straw, is going to

11

buy this gun.

12

buys the gun, and the dealer writes down Mr. Straw's

13

name for the fifteenth time that month, his address,

14

does another instant check on it.

He gives Mr. Straw the money, Mr. Straw

15

What sense does that make.

16

MR. DIETZ:

Your Honor, I think, to your

17

first point about why, why starting points, the reason

18

is because all that Congress wanted is to provide law

19

enforcement with a way to trace the firearm.

20

If you have truthful, accurate information

21

about the first initial purchaser, the person who walks

22

out of a gun store with a gun in their hand, then law

23

enforcement has that starting point if they need to

24

trace the firearm.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I suppose ­­ I suppose that

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

your answer to what sense it makes is that was the

2

compromise, that there was strong opposition to any gun

3

control law, and the condition was you get the buyer,

4

and you don't make the buyer promise not to give it to

5

somebody else.

6

He could immediately give it to somebody

7

who's unqualified to own the gun, couldn't he?

8

that be a violation?

9

MR. DIETZ:

Would

Your Honor, that would ­­ that

10

would violate other laws because Congress, in the

11

Firearm Owners Protection Act, clarified that ­­ or

12

amended the provision to provide that a private citizen

13

who transfers a firearm to someone they know or have

14

reasonable cause to believe is prohibited, that's a

15

crime.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What about somebody ­­

17

somebody who is qualified to own a firearm?

18

a firearm that I own and say ­­ you know, it's yours?

19

MR. DIETZ:

Can I take

Yes, Your Honor, and I think the

20

government has conceded that if it's someone in your own

21

State, there's ­­

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Don't have to register it?

23

I don't have to go through a firearm dealer, right?

24

It's my gun, and I can give it to somebody else who's

25

qualified.

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. DIETZ:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And

2

in cases like Mr. Abramski's case, where his uncle lived

3

in another State, Congress provided a path for those

4

people as well, and that is they have to deliver the

5

firearm to another dealer in that State before finishing

6

the transfer.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you're never going to

8

know who the end user is once the gun is sold, whether

9

you take the ­­ you know, the straw buyer's name or

10

the ­­ or the other person's name or both.

11

know where the gun is going to end up, do you?

uses the straw.

the benefactor is not the purchaser.

3

5

someone else put up the bail, and it was called straw

because the people who made a career of that used to

7

wear straw in their shoes.

Interesting.

The fact is that is where

it comes from.
I think, in every legal context, it means

21

purchased.

22

So who is the real?

So we fit that within the language.

In

We

23

can't fit the beneficiary of a gift within the language

10
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. DIETZ:

With respect, Your Honor, I

2

think that the principle you described of a straw man or

3

straw purchases in the context ­­ historical context you

4

described it, I don't believe is a criminal context.

5

We've not been able to find any case in

6

which the criminal law has ever recognized that sort of

7

civil agency law principle, that when there is a

8

principal­agent relationship, this fiduciary duty,

9

that because the principal controls the agent or the

10

straw man, that everything that the agent does is really

11

an act of the principal.

12

And Congress ­­ there were historically

13

criminal common law principles of agency. And

14

codified those principles in Title 18, United States

15

Code, Section 2.

23

weapon, but that's not going to be true in the case of a

24

straw purchaser because the person ­­ the straw

25

purchaser, isn't necessarily and probably in the vast

You said that it allows the tracing of the

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

majority of cases isn't going to get the name or any

2

information about the actual recipient.

3

That's the whole purpose of having a straw

4

purchaser.

5

It's just meaningless.

6

So then what purpose is served by this?

MR. DIETZ:

With respect, Your Honor, I

7

disagree.

And I think the reason is again that the

8

intent of Congress in the Gun Control Act was not to

9

trace or track where firearms were going.

So in every

10

case, because private sales have no recordkeeping or

11

background check requirements, in every case where

12

there's a trace of a firearm the government has to go

13

all the way back to the beginning.

14

They go to the manufacturer with the serial

15

number and follow the gun through the stream of commerce

16

until they find that gun dealer where the gun was first sold,

17

and then they ­­

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

So they find the gun dealer

19

and the gun dealer says, I sold it to Mr. Straw.

20

then they go to Mr. Straw and Mr. Straw said:

21

took it.

22

came into my store. You know,

23

name.

24

of it.

25

Okay, who's your client?

My client

I have no idea.

He contacted me.

He didn't give me his name.

And

He

I didn't ask his

And that's the end

So no purpose is served by putting down the

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

name, the address, doing the check on the straw

2

purchaser.

3

MR. DIETZ:

But, Your Honor, again Congress

4

understood that that's how the statute worked because,

5

for example ­­

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what you're saying is

7

they did a meaningless thing.

8

They would do something that's utterly meaningless.

9

MR. DIETZ:

That was the compromise.

No, Your Honor.

And the reason

10

is, consider for example a circumstance where, instead

11

of buying firearm with intent to resell it, five minutes

12

after the purchase, walking out of the gun store, a

13

stranger approaches you and says, that's a nice looking

14

gun, I'd like to buy it from you.

15

It's perfectly legal under the Gun Control

16

Act to sell the gun to that stranger, who then will

17

leave and again in the tracing process, the government's

18

trace will stop with that first purchaser.

19

understood that that's how the process would work and

20

that was part of the compromise.

21

was accurate information about the initial person who

22

acquires the firearm so at least they can try to do that

23

trace.

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Your position is that this

is not a material misstatement; is that correct?

16

MR. DIETZ:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes, Your Honor.
Why isn't it material in

18

light of the fact that it was a question that was on the

19

government form that was promulgated, that was directed

20

by regulations?

21

MR. DIETZ:

The reason, Your Honor ­­ I

22

think this is a critical concession by the government.

23

It's on pages 35 and 36 of their brief.

24

acknowledges that the statements on the form are just an

25

interpretive rule and not even sort of ordinary

14
Alderson Reporting Company

The government

Official

1

interpretive rule that this Court may encounter with

2

agency interpretations where they are looking at the

3

statute, and although they have not been delegated with

4

authority to rule make, they are interpreting the text

5

of the statute.

6

the statement is an interpretation of the case law about

7

the straw purchaser doctrine.

8

Here, the government acknowledges that

And the problem with that is that there's a

9

split in the circuits about what that case precedent

10

should be, and the government's suggesting that this

11

Court should somehow defer to the statement on the form

12

that it has the power of law, that people should

13

acknowledge it.

14

But, of course, when you have a case law

15

question like this where there's a split, this Court is

16

the authority that decides what the law should be.

17

it's not required to defer at all to the statements on

18

the form.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And

Mr. Dietz, can we go back to

20

the question that Justice Alito raised?

21

object of this statute is to keep guns out of the

22

felons, of people with mental illness and so forth.

23

The primary
hands of

Now, it's absolutely true, as you have said,

24

that Congress didn't do everything it could have to

25

achieve that result, right?

That there are many kinds

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of resales that are allowable, that there are gifts that

2

are allowable.

3

It's one thing to say that.

It's another

4

thing to say that at the initial point of sale, which is

5

where the entire system is set up, right, with the gun

6

dealer doing the automatic checks, that at that initial

7

point of sale, which is the centerpiece of this statute,

8

that we will ­­ that we will essentially disregard

9

fronts, that we ­­ you know, that we don't care that the

10

person standing at the counter is a front.

11

I mean, that goes far beyond the other kinds

12

of resale possibilities that you're talking about.

13

I guess what I want to know is why you think a Congress

14

that was geared towards this object of keeping guns out

15

of the hands of dangerous people and set up a mechanism

16

that had the gun seller be the kind of enforcer, at the

17

point of sale, would have thought, oh, it's fine if a

18

front, if a straw walks in the door.

19

MR. DIETZ:

And

The reason, Your Honor, is

20

because Congress understood that private sales ­­ that

21

there was an importance to private sales between

22

citizens.

23

someone who's purchasing a gun intending to resell it to

24

someone else, that is precisely what's happening is that

25

second sale is a private transaction between two private

And in a straw purchase like this or ­­ or

16

2

those types of sales.

3

political compromise in the law.

4

And that was part of the

5

could certainly describe this as ­­ as not a

6

comprehensive regime.

7

legislation.

8

operating in a vacuum.

There are holes in the

9

It understood that, although there might not

10

be a national consensus about some of these issues and,

11

therefore, the regime that Congress chose may have some

12

holes in it.

13

there was a State­wide consensus on that issue.

14

many States have done that.

15

But the States could fill those holes if
And

Some States have ­­ Hawaii, for example ­­

16

what is really a complete gun registration system.

17

others, like West Virginia, believe that there should be

18

virtually no regulation of these sorts of private sales

19

at all.

20

And

And so I think the system is working

21

precisely as Congress intended.

22

problems, Congress will come back and fix it.

23

24

But that's not the situation here.

13

Mr. Abramski was physically present at the gun store and

14

so that provision of the statute is not even implicated

15

here.

16

Another point, Your Honors, is that the

17

plain text interpretation of the statute is one that the

18

agency, ATF, had adopted initially.

19

sent a circular to gun dealers that took the ­­ the

20

precise position that ­­ that Petitioner is taking here,

which is that a purchase of a gun for another lawful gun

owner is permissible.

government contend that there are two buyers now?

4

Both ­­ is the real buyer the person who sends in the

5

straw man so that it's only his information that you

6

have to give?

7

Or are there two buyers?

MR. DIETZ:

Your Honor, I don't know the

8

government's position, but our position is that there's

9

one buyer, and that's the person who's actually paying

10

for the gun, filling out the forms, undergoing a

11

background check, and leaving the gun ­­ leaving the gun

12

store with the gun in their hand.

13

And Congress didn't use terms like "true

14

buyer" or "true purchaser" or "actual buyer" because

15

they are not concerned about the ultimate recipients of

16

firearms or what happens to a gun after it leaves the

17

MR. DIETZ:

We are

arguing, yes, that the person who pays for the gun, the

MR. DIETZ:

12

And ­­ and in those circumstances ­­ again, I think this

13

is an important point ­­ is that Congress provided a

14

number of means to prosecute illegal straw purchasers.

15

And all of those provisions are still available to the

16

government, even if this Court was to disapprove the

17

straw purchaser doctrine in all its applications.

JUSTICE ALITO:

If we disagree with you on

19

the first point about the straw purchaser, would you ­­

20

would you lose on the grounds that Mr. Abramski's uncle

21

could not have lawfully purchased the gun at that store

22

because he wasn't a resident of the State?

23

MR. DIETZ:

No, Your Honor.

to take possession of it in Pennsylvania after filling

out additional paperwork and ­­

That's correct, Your Honor.

12

But, again, I don't think that that changes the

13

materiality analysis, because, again, the question is

14

not whether Mr. Abramski's uncle could have picked up or

15

bought the gun in Virginia.

16

The question is, if Mr. Abramski had told

17

the gun dealer the truth, that yes, I plan to buy this

18

gun, but I'm going to take it up to Pennsylvania and

19

give it to my uncle after I deliver it to a gun dealer

there, the way that Congress wrote the Gun Control Act,

the gun dealer still could have sold the gun to

Mr. Abramski.

reason is that the government's position is that you

that Congress chose

That count ­­

the language

was that one cannot "make a

false statement about information required by this

chapter to be kept," "this chapter" meaning chapter 44,

2

the Gun Control Act itself.

3

contains ­­ it actually references a provision, and

4

that's 922(b)(5), where Congress says this is the

5

information that uses that term, "required to be kept."

6

And the Gun Control Act

and place of residence of the person acquiring the gun

this question 11, who is the actual buyer, that's not

the government has said in this case is, well, that's

right, but we view the authorization of Congress to

MR. DIETZ:

Your Honor, I think the key in

7

this case is that Congress included a materiality

8

element for almost every false statement that would

9

occur in this context.

10

And they enacted a separate

statute that did not have that materiality requirement.

11

And the reason was Congress wanted to be

12

sure that that provision that did not have the

13

materiality requirement only applied to the false

14

statements that Congress thought were the very important

15

ones, and therefore they delineated what those ­­ that

category of statements was.

reason why Mr. Abramski cannot be convicted under that

provision.

MR. PALMORE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
I think it would be helpful if I could, at

4

the outset, frame what I see as the issues here because,

5

as some of the questioning revealed, Petitioner is

6

making two separate arguments.

7

in a sense, that there is no such thing as a straw

8

purchaser doctrine.

9

argument.

10

His first argument is,

I take that actually as a falsity

He's saying when I answered that I was the

11

purchaser, that was a true statement because I'm the

12

only purchaser who counted for purposes of the statute,

13

because I was the one standing there and I was the one

14

filling out the form.

15

His second argument is an alternative

16

argument, as I understand it, and he says, even assuming

17

I'm wrong about the first argument and that this

18

statement was false, that that falsehood was not

19

material because my uncle was legally eligible to

20

possess a firearm.

21

arguments in ­­ in order.

MR. PALMORE:

Justice Scalia, if you ­­ if

you hypothesize the situation in which two roommates

wanted to buy a firearm together ­­ firearms are

9

expensive; they can't each afford their own, but they

10

want one for personal protection.

11

And if one went into the store and said, I'm

12

buying this firearm for myself and my roommate who's not

13

here, that transaction could not lawfully go forward,

14

because the two buyers of the firearm weren't in the

store and they weren't physically present and they

didn't go through all the statutory screening processes.

12

at issue here, and this is quoted on pages 1 through 2

of the government's brief.

14

It's the false statement provision

So the provision says:

"It shall be

15

unlawful for any person in connection with the

16

acquisition or attempted acquisition of a firearm," and

17

it goes on, and it talks ­­ and at the end it talks

18

about the "lawfulness of the sale or other disposition

19

of such firearm."

20

This case isn't the first one in which the

21

Court has had occasion to interpret those terms.

22

Huddleston the Court looked at those terms, in

23

particular "acquisition" and "disposition," and it said

24

several things about those terms that are relevant here.

25

It said those terms are meant to have a practical,

31
Alderson Reporting Company

In

Official
1

common sense meaning in terms of who will come into

2

possession and control of a firearm as the result of a

transaction with a federally regulated dealer, and they

4

don't turn on formal notions of legal title; and that

5

with respect to "disposition" in particular that

6

Congress meant to give broad effect to this term.

7

And so we think that the same kind of

8

practical common sense inquiry is applicable here.

9

looking at the transaction the question is what is the

10

ultimate purpose and effect of this transaction.

11

to have someone else acquire the firearm.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

When

Is it

That's awfully broad.

Justice Breyer, I think

10

that ­­ that the other provisions that Petitioner is

11

referring to is 922(d), which makes it unlawful for

12

anyone, licensed or unlicensed, to transfer a firearm to

13

someone in a prohibited category if the transferor knows

14

or has reasonable cause to believe that the person is in

15

a prohibited category.

16

And that is a completely inadequate

substitute for what ­­ the kind of regulation we're

So in my ­­ my hypothetical involving the

There's, as far as I can tell, nothing in

MR. PALMORE:

Well, but there

1

wasn't ­­ there wasn't a strong lobby in Congress saying

2

we're the group that supports Ponzi schemes, so maybe it

3

makes more sense to have a broad construction of that

provision.

5

This language is fought over tooth and nail

6

by people on the ­­ you know, gun control side and the

gun ownership side.

8

say well, the purpose is this, even though there's no

MR. PALMORE:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you're right.

Before you go on ­­
Yeah.
­­ I wanted to get back to

23

the Al Capone hypothetical.

24

Petitioner's case here, I don't think he's asserting

25

that if Al Capone, if ­­ if he intended to transfer it

As I understand

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to Al Capone, that his statement would not have been

2

material.

3

it to somebody who could lawfully possess it, the

4

statement was immaterial.

5

His position is, since I intended to transfer

MR. PALMORE:

And my point, Justice Scalia,

6

is that in a straw­purchase context, you're not

7

necessarily going to know you're dealing with Al Capone

8

or someone of his record.

9

which people have an ephemeral relationship.

10
11

These are often cases in
They may

not even know each other's names.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Palmore, is that

12

right?

13

what Justice Scalia just said, that for Mr. Dietz,

14

regarding ­­ you can ­­ he might be prosecuted under

15

another statute for selling something to somebody he

16

knows is Al Capone, but that he was ­­ you know, because

17

he was the guy at the counter and he was buying for

18

somebody else, as to this question of material

19

representation, it does not matter whether the ultimate

20

transferee was Al Capone or somebody else.

21

I thought that Mr. Dietz's argument went beyond

MR. PALMORE:

I think that's right, Justice

22

Kagan.

23

be his main submission is essentially that his statement

24

was true.

25

And that's his first argument and what I take to

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think he said that just

41
Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

right in here.
MR. PALMORE:

Right, he did.

It was true,

3

so you don't even get to the materiality question.

4

that's right.

5

be a violation if he knows or has reasonable cause to

6

believe that the transferee is in a prohibited category.

7

So

That subsequent transfer might separately

I would just point out, though, that that

8

would not have been the case from 1968 to 1986 because

9

922(d), which prohibits transfers to ineligible

10

transferors ­­ I'm sorry ­­ transferees applied only to

11

licensed dealers until 1986.

12

private individuals.

13

It didn't apply to ­­ to

So the kind of straw purchase on behalf of

14

Al Capone, as I understand it under Petitioner's theory,

15

would have been perfectly legal from 1968 to 1986, even

16

if it was knowing.

17

Justice Ginsburg, we talked a little bit

18

before about how ATF's view kind of caught up with the

19

case law.

20

quite helpful here for illuminating the materiality

21

question.

22

And I think some of that case law is actually

And it's the Crandall case from the First

23

Circuit that we talk about in the brief.

24

is correct that the materiality of a false statement

25

turns on whether the ultimate ­­ in this context,

42
Alderson Reporting Company

If Petitioner

Official

1

whether the ultimate purchaser or the actual transferee

2

of the firearm was eligible or not, it's unclear why

3

a ­­ someone seeking to buy a gun from a federally

4

regulated dealer couldn't go in, provide a false name

5

and provide a false identification and receive a gun.

6

And then if he's prosecuted for that false

7

statement, he could defend, as the defendant in Crandall

8

tried to defend, saying, well, it didn't really matter

9

because I'm actually eligible.

So even if you'd known

10

my true name and had my true nonforged ID, he would have

11

sold me the gun, so it's not material.

12

The courts of appeals and the lower courts

13

have consistently rejected that argument.

14

those courts hold is that in all cases, the lawfulness

15

of the sale of a firearm from a regulated dealer is

16

contingent on the recording, confirming, and after 1993,

17

screening of the identity of the purchaser.

18
19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And what

Now, this ­­ this ­­

now you're talking about the second question.

MR. PALMORE:

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Correct.
And the provision

22

that makes the ­­ the information that's required, makes

23

it material ­­ correct me if I'm wrong ­­ is 922(b)(5),

24

right?

25

That's what requires ­­

MR. PALMORE:

That's one of the provisions.

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

Now, all that

2

says is you have to keep the information of the person

3

to whom you're transferring the firearm.

4

argument has to be, when somebody sees the person, they

5

realize that that means not somebody who's buying it for

6

somebody else, right?

7

MR. PALMORE:

Right.

So your

And if you're with me

8

on the straw purchase idea, that this was a false

9

statement because the purpose and effect of the

10

transaction was to ­­ for the uncle to acquire the

11

firearm, then that was a false statement, then the

12

actual purchaser name is recorded ­­

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.

Yes.

I know.

14

If I assume ­­ if I assume you're right, then you're

15

right.

16

MR. PALMORE:

If you assume I'm right on

17

issue 1, then I think that the materiality on issue 2

18

follows directly from ­­ from this provision that you

19

quote in 922(b)(5).

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Because then

21

"person," you know carries with it the concept of not

22

just the person to whom it's transferred, which is what

23

922(b)(5) says, but the fact that it's ­­ has to be the

24

actual person who ends up with the gun.

25

MR. PALMORE:

Yes.

And I think the term

2

922(b)(5).

3

provisions, and there it talks about a transfer, so we

talked before about how there are different terms that

are used.

So 922(t) says that the ­­ no transfer of a

firearm can take place unless the identity of the ­­ of

transferee is confirmed with a photo identification and

20

unless that identity is screened through a database to

21

ensure that that person is eligible.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If you're right on Question

23

1, 922(t) just makes this a slam dunk on Question 2.

24

And there's a question about whether you are right on

25

Question 1.

But if you are, (t) says, look, the dealer

45
Alderson Reporting Company

is supposed to check the transferee, right?

And if we

2

assume that when Congress says "the transferee," it's

3

the real transferee, not the fake transferee, the dealer

is supposed to check the real transferee.

structure ­­ it's not just the overriding purpose.

9

922(t) says that the dealer is supposed to check the

10

transferee to find out whether the transferee has a

11

criminal record, to find out whether the transferee has

12

mental illness.

So who does he check?

firearms for illicit reasons.

they had ­­ they wanted to not have their name

Those are all cases in which eligible parties

They were eligible, but

So Polk, which is the Fifth Circuit case,

which is actually on Petitioner's side, that person

wanted to anonymously acquire firearms to create a

stockpile to attack an IRS building, to kill police

10

officers, and to assassinate a judge.

11

eligible.

But he was

12

In Frazier and Morales, which are the

13

Eleventh and Sixth Circuit cases addressing this

14

materiality issue, there were straw purchases on behalf

15

of eligible buyers, but they were, again, wanting to

16

anonymously stockpile weapons and not have their names

17

associated with them because they were smuggling them

18

out of the country.

19

And the Petitioner's view of the statute in

20

which a straw purchaser can satisfy the requirement that

21

the first transaction, at the point of sale be recorded

22

would completely satisfy the statutory requirements,

23

would greatly impair the ability of ATF to trace

24

firearms and to have an accurate record of who that

25

first purchaser of the firearm was.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

Mr. Dietz, you have four minutes.

5

Thank you, counsel.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. DIETZ

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

MR. DIETZ:

Justice Ginsburg, you asked

8

counsel whether this was a case where there were two

9

interpretations of the statute.

Counsel conceded that

10

there were.

11

of course, we're dealing with a criminal statute.

12

there are two interpretations under very well­settled

13

precedent from this Court, the court applies the

14

interpretation that's favorable to the criminal

15

defendant and that's part of the doctrine of criminal

16

law.

17

I think that's an important point because,

Justice Kennedy, you ­­ you mentioned the ­­

18

the agency situation that existed here between

19

Mr. Abramski and his uncle.

20

important to note that there wasn't even any

21

consideration.

22

a favor for a family member.

23

If

And here, I think it's

This was truly a purchase that was just

And the government, in order to advance this

24

straw purchaser theory that historically came from civil

25

common law, there needs to be a relationship between

55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Mr. Abramski and his uncle that is a fiduciary

2

relationship where Mr. Abramski is required to act in

3

his uncle's best interests at all times.

4

And that, for example, if he left the gun

5

store and someone said, hey, did you just pick up a

6

Glock, I'll buy it for you for $500, that Mr. Abramski

7

could not even enter into that sale without providing

8

his uncle with ­­ with any money he made from that sale.

9

And there's ­­ there's a complex set of

10

civil agency law principles that apply here that just

11

don't translate to the straw purchaser doctrine as we've

12

described it.

13

the government's theory is that the courts just have

14

never thought through all of the various situations that

15

apply in these fiduciary relationships and how you would

16

apply them to situations where you're just buying a gun

17

for a family member or something of that nature.

18

And I think that's a fundamental flaw in

I also wanted to turn to the gift exception.

19

There's also another exception the government

20

acknowledges and that's for raffles and contests at

21

charities or ­­ you know, political fundraisers.

22

in that circumstance, the person who's buying the gun

23

knows that they're giving it to a complete stranger and

24

someone who by random chance wins the right to own the

25

gun.

56
Alderson Reporting Company

And so

Official

1

But in those cases, the government says

2

there's no need, at the time that you buy the gun, to

3

take any steps to ensure there's recordkeeping or a

4

background check on that person.

5

undermines this idea that everyone receiving a gun in

6

the chain from the gun dealer Congress wants to have a

7

background check.

8

enough information to allow for tracing and nothing

9

more.

10

And I think that

Congress is concerned about providing

And as a final point, Your Honors, I think,

11

perhaps, the most important point in this case is if the

12

Court rejects the straw purchaser doctrine as it ­­ as

13

it applies in this case to a lawful gun owner buying for

14

another, there are really no harmful consequences.

15

The government retains a very robust toolbox

16

of criminal statutes to prosecute illegal straw

17

purchasers, those who buy guns to get them into the

18

hands of prohibited persons, and the government will

19

receive accurate, truthful information about that first

20

sale so they can trace firearms when they're used in the

21

commission of a crime.

22

So the only thing the straw purchaser

23

doctrine in this case really accomplishes is to prohibit

24

law­abiding citizens from buying guns for other

25

law­abiding citizens, and that's something that Congress

57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

expressly chose not to do.

2

to remain faithful to the statutory scheme actually

3

enacted by Congress.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

And we would ask this Court

Well, if we agreed with you

5

on the ­­ on the second argument, would the government

6

have to prove that the person to whom the straw

7

purchaser transferred the gun was ineligible or would it

8

be a defense if it was shown that the person was

9

eligible?

10

MR. DIETZ:

I think the government would

11

have the burden there, Your Honor.

12

government has suggested ­­ they provide an example of a

13

circumstance where the ­­ the person who bought the gun

14

was buying it for someone named, I believe, Almonio, who

15

they had no idea who that was.

16

circumstance, the government would need to prove that

17

that person was prohibited.

And I think the

But, yes, in that

18

But I think in circumstances like that where

19

you're buying guns for someone you don't even know who

20

that person is, the government may well have evidence in

21

that case that you either knew or had reasonable cause

22

to believe that that person was prohibited from

23

possessing a gun.

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

But the other purpose that

they said this provision has is to get gun dealers to

58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

run checks.

2

there.

3

And you can't run a check if the name isn't

MR. DIETZ:

That's right, Your Honor.

And,

4

of course, you can't run a check on someone who wins the

5

gun in a raffle or ­­

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

But the other

7

problem ­­ we're back to the language.

8

they say your client ­­ you know, falls within the

9

language and you say he doesn't.

10

The ­­ there ­­

Is it ­­ all right.

Forget it.
