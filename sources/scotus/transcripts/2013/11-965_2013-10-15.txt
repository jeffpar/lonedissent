Mr. Dupree.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS H. DUPREE, JR.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. DUPREE:

9

please the Court:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

The Ninth Circuit held that Daimler, a

11

foreign corporation, is subject to general jurisdiction

12

in California and thus may be sued in California on any

13

claim arising anywhere in the world.

14

reached this conclusion by attributing to Daimler the

15

California contacts of a Daimler subsidiary, Mercedes

16

Benz USA, a separate corporation that respects all

17

corporate formalities and that is not Daimler's alter

18

ego.

The Ninth Circuit's approach violates due

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Now, are there ­­ were

2

there California cases that disregarded the ­­ the

3

corporate form?

4

MR. DUPREE:

California respects the

5

corporate form.

6

to be a Federal common law of agency that the Ninth

7

Circuit admittedly developed solely for purposes of the

8

jurisdictional inquiry.

9

The Ninth Circuit applied what appears

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But the jurisdictional

10

inquiry is conducted on the basis of the California

11

statute, isn't it?

12

MR. DUPREE:

It is, but at the same time,

13

the California statute extends to the limit of due

14

process.

15

construed what the permissible outer bounds of the due

16

process clause was in this context.

17

And so what the Ninth Circuit did was it

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I see.

It's ­­ it's

18

California's reference to the outer bounds of

19

jurisdiction that causes ­­ causes this to be a

20

constitutional case?

21

MR. DUPREE:

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's correct, Justice Scalia.
There's nothing in

23

the Constitution, is there, that would prohibit a State

24

from adopting a rule that a parent is responsible for

25

any acts of a wholly­owned subsidiary?

4
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. DUPREE:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there

2

may be a constitutional limit; certainly, to the extent

3

that, say, California adopted a rule that said, for

4

purposes of some sort of liability, we are going to

5

disregard the corporate form, I think that could pose

6

due process concerns to the extent that it is purporting

7

to override, say, the corporate law of Delaware.

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, even on a

9

prospective basis, your brief talks about notice and

10

fairness and predictability; but if California said,

11

going forward, this is the rule that we're going to

12

apply, is there any constitutional problem with that?

19

21

to rewrite the corporate DNA of a corporation that's

22

6

We permitted California law to tax the

MR. DUPREE:

And we said the due process

Well, Justice Sotomayor,

7

typically, this Court has applied a less rigorous due

8

process standard in the tax cases than it has in the

9

personal jurisdiction cases.

10

If one were to look at, say, Goodyear or

11

McIntyre, of any of this Court's more recent

12

jurisdictional decisions, it typically takes a much more

13

rigorous view of the due process clause's limits on a

14

sovereign's ability to adjudicate matters that arise

15

outside the forum than it has in the tax context.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We would never get to

17

this question if you hadn't conceded that there is

18

general jurisdiction over the U.S. subsidiary, over ­­

19

what is it ­­ MBUSA.

20

MR. DUPREE:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

21

respectfully disagree that we conceded the point below.

22

I'm not sure, frankly, that we could concede something

23

like that on behalf of a different corporation that's

24

not a party to this lawsuit.

25

But it is true that we focused on the

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Dupree ­­ I'm sorry.

Please.
MR. DUPREE:

I was going to say, Your Honor,

20

at the same time, I do think that that notion, that

21

MBUSA was subject to general jurisdiction in California,

22

was necessarily part of the Ninth Circuit's holding.

23

I do think it is properly preserved for this Court's

24

review, if the Court elected to resolve this case on

25

that ground.

7
Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official

1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And, Mr. Dupree, even if you

2

waived that point, if I understand it correctly, you did

3

not waive the point that, even with all attribution in

4

the world, there still is no general jurisdiction over

5

Daimler.

6

MBUSA's contacts, and you still would not have general

7

jurisdiction over Daimler; is that right?

8
9
10

In other words, you could attribute all

MR. DUPREE:

Justice Kagan, that is exactly

right.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

So in that sense, it really

11

doesn't depend on the attribution standard, all these

12

hard questions of is it an alter ego test or is it an

13

agency test and how does the Constitution relate to

14

State law because we could apply any test we wanted and

15

there still wouldn't be general jurisdiction over

16

Daimler in California.

17

MR. DUPREE:

Justice Kagan, that certainly

18

would be an acceptable route for this Court to resolve

19

the case.

20

even if one were to attribute the constitutional

21

contacts of MBUSA to Daimler, you would still be left

22

with a joint enterprise that, plainly, is not at home in

23

the State of California.

24
25

And Your Honor has it exactly right, in that,

It would still be a German corporation,
headquartered in Stuttgart, that draws only

countries that assert jurisdiction over the parent, if

9

MR. DUPREE:

Would ­­

By and large, Justice Scalia,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MR. DUPREE:

I'm not aware of anyone who

15

disrespects it; and, in fact, our amici talk at length

16

about how California's exercise of general jurisdiction

17

in this case would not be appropriate in virtually any

18

other nation.

19

When

10

11

12

So ­­ so how can we deal with a circuit

13

court that seems to seriously misstate the law of a

14

State?

15

MR. DUPREE:

Well, I think the way this

16

Court should deal with the Ninth Circuit in this case is

17

simply to reverse it, Your Honor.

I would like to know the

chain of reasoning that gets ­­

23

(Laughter.)

24

MR. DUPREE:

25

I understand that that's

what you would like as the bottom line.

20

22

I think ­­

The chain of reasoning, Your

Honor, is simply that California, like all States,

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

generally respects the corporate form, certainly with

2

regard to liability determinations.

3

In fact, this is a point that Professor

4

Brilmayer makes at length in her amicus brief, where she

5

says that it is anomalous for a State, on one hand, to

6

respect the corporate form as to liability

7

determinations, but then, when it comes to making these

8

sorts of personal jurisdictional determinations, it

9

applies a completely different standard.

10

So I think ­­

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But suppose ­­ but

12

suppose we had a case of an accident on a California

13

highway injuring California people and they sued,

14

charging that the Mercedes Benz was defectively

15

manufactured.

16
17
18

Would there be jurisdiction over both the
parent and the sub in that situation?
MR. DUPREE:

If it were the case Your Honor

19

hypothesized, I think there may well be specific

20

jurisdiction available, depending on whether Daimler

21

purposefully availed itself of the California forum.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And what does that mean?

23

I mean, it certainly wanted to have its cars sold in ­­

24

in California.

25

MR. DUPREE:

Right.

What this Court has

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

said in its opinions in Asahi and then, of course, in

2

McEntyre, is that you look whether the corporation

3

targeted the forum.

4

opinion identified several facts that could support such

5

a finding.

6

And in Asahi, Justice O'Connor's

For example, whether the parent targeted

7

advertising at the forum, whether the parent designed a

8

product specifically for use in that forum.

9

course, this Court has said, repeatedly, that questions

And, of

10

of specific jurisdiction are highly fact dependent.

11

And so, in Your Honor's hypothetical, I

12

think what the plaintiffs would do to establish specific

13

jurisdiction over the foreign parent would be precisely

14

to attempt to amass evidence showing that Daimler

15

targeted the forum where they intend to bring the suit.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Counsel ­­
Well, there was injury in

18

the forum, and it was caused by defective manufacturing

19

abroad.

20

long­arm statutes.

21

That's a typical basis for jurisdiction under

MR. DUPREE:

Well, certainly, courts have

22

exercised specific jurisdiction in that situation.

23

of course, as this Court's ruling in McEntyre

24

illustrates, that's not necessarily always the case, and

25

there may, of course, be situations where a product does

would you say?

MR. DUPREE:

to what this Court has articulated, first of all, is the

standard for specific jurisdiction, which is purposeful

17

availment or purposeful direction.

subsidiary is not availing itself of jurisdiction?

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. DUPREE:

Well, Justice Kennedy, I think,

2

in some cases, a subsidiary's work could give rise to

3

specific jurisdiction, but I think that's not

4

necessarily true across the United States in all cases.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I agree.

And I'm asking

6

what is the rationale that you would use to answer

7

Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical in the ­­ in the opinion

8

for the Court that is ruling in your favor?

9

MR. DUPREE:

The answer I would give is

10

that, in Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, the foreign

11

parent could be subject to specific jurisdiction if it

12

purposefully availed itself of the forum, and that very

13

well could be an inquiry that turns on the subsidiary's

14

activity.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And my question is whether

16

or not by creating Mercedes U.S., Daimler didn't

17

purposely avail itself of the forum?

18
19

MR. DUPREE:

I don't think it did,

Justice Kennedy.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21

MR. DUPREE:

Because?
Because I don't think there is

22

any evidence in this record that suggests that, by

creating a subsidiary that does business generally, it

was purposefully targeting California.

Mr. Dupree ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

4

subsidiary is an alter ego of the parent, would that

5

depend on the ­­ the law of the particular State in

6

which the suit is brought?

7

8

MR. DUPREE:

Or would it be based on some

Justice Alito, I think the best

test would be to look to State law for guidance,

10

precisely because that is the law that commercial actors

11

throughout our country typically would look to, to

12

determine whether or not they might be in a

13

veil­piercing situation.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

That would mean that due

15

process would mean something different potentially in

16

California and New York, for example.

17

rather strange?

18

MR. DUPREE:

Wouldn't that be

Well, I'm not sure, Your Honor.

19

Certainly this Court, in other due process contexts, has

20

looked to the substance of State law to inform its

21

judgements, for example, in determining the scope of

22

protected property interests.

23

cases, it's looked to State law to determine the

24

constitutional boundaries.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In punitive damages

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well ­­
Didn't we create tests

6

in International Shoe, in Burger King, separate from

7

State law?

8
9

MR. DUPREE:

The test this Court created in

International Shoe, I think, is probably best

10

characterized as a Federal common law test.

11

that this situation is not quite analogous, precisely

12

for the reason I mentioned in my answer to

13

Justice Alito, is that commercial actors and lawyers and

14

parties throughout the country typically look to State

15

law for guidance.

16

I think

And if this Court were to adopt a general

17

Federal common law standard, under which I think we

18

would still prevail, but ­­

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what do we do with

20

all the amici briefs that points to countless articles

21

that talk about the corporate veil­piercing as the most

22

arbitrary of State laws out there?

23

MR. DUPREE:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

Well, I'm not sure ­­
I don't know how ­­ how

corporations get any sense of comfort from a law that's

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

2

so irrationally applied, according to some.
MR. DUPREE:

Well, I think some of the

3

amici, candidly, may overstate the purported confusion.

4

At the end of the day, veil­piercing law is certainly

5

well settled and vetted in this country's legal

6

traditions, and I think it is sufficiently capable of

7

precise application in advance.

8

that standard on a day­to­day basis.

Corporations deal with

And so, although I take Your Honor's point

10

that, at the margins, there may be room for debate as to

11

whether a veil should be pierced in a particular case, I

12

think, by and large, it's a general standard, it's a

13

familiar standard, and it's a workable standard, and

14

it's a standard that people look to on a day­to­day

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. RUSSELL:

Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to begin with the question of

1

what's in this case and what isn't because the fact

2

pattern in this case gives rise to multiple complicated

3

questions, only two of which have been adequately

4

preserved in this case.

5

not in the case, Justice Kagan, is whether or not, if

6

MBUSA's contacts are attributable, they are sufficient

7

to establish general jurisdiction.

8

And one of the questions that's

This case has been in litigation on the
personal jurisdiction issue for eight years.

Throughout

10

that period, we have argued that if MBUSA's contacts

11

were attributed to Daimler, they were sufficient in kind

12

and quantity to support general jurisdiction over

13

Daimler itself.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So if a Mercedes Benz

15

vehicle overturned in Poland and injured the Polish

16

driver and passenger, suit for the design defect could

17

be brought in California?

18

MR. RUSSELL:

That's right.

And if you

19

think that the answer to that is wrong, it's because of

20

the argument that Daimler did not preserve.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes, but, Mr. Russell, it's

22

usually ­­ it doesn't lead to good results when you

23

assume something that is obviously in error ­­ you know,

time appealing from a decision that refused to exercise

supplemental jurisdiction.

21

that the Court actually granted cert on and which was

22

actually preserved here, I do think that the Court could

23

simply hold that, look, attribution of contacts between

24

a wholly­owned subsidiary and its parents is not so

unreasonable as to violate the Constitution.

But, again, on the question

Now, instead of those five shareholders,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

law, don't you think it's extraordinary that the Ninth

Circuit could make such a significant holding on ­­ on

California law without ­­ there is a certification

MR. RUSSELL:

I mean, usually, courts of appeals don't

1

here, Petitioner never asked them to.

10

And so on the ­­ the premises on which this

11

case was litigated, I do think you can decide this case

12

by resolving two questions.

13

that if MBUSA's contacts are attributable to Petitioner,

14

they are sufficient to make it at home, does the fact

15

that those contacts are through a wholly­owned

regarding this in­home ­­ this at­home question, why

21

shouldn't the rule be that, unless a corporation is

of the subsidiary are not attributable, unless it's an

purpose.

shouldn't we have a nice, clear rule like that, and

Now, that specific jurisdiction has been

Just to be clear, there are

assertion that ordinarily, you're only at home in the

remand, I think there is absolutely no reason for this

10

Court to remand this case to the Ninth Circuit.

11

issues as to attribution were fully briefed below.

12

are fully briefed here.

13

to either remand the case or dismiss the case, for one

14

thing, the circuit split would persist.

15

Circuit's decision in the event of a remand would remain

16

on the books.

Even if this Court were to remand the
decision of the Second Circuit, which ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do you really care how

20

we do it?

21

adequately briefed, conceded when they are, obviously,

22

fallacious and unsupportable, why don't we just say,

23

simply, exercise of jurisdiction is unreasonable in this

24

case?

25

Given that so many issues have not been

MR. DUPREE:

Well, Justice Sotomayor ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The other side ­­

2

neither you or the other side have argued that there

3

isn't a reasonableness component.

I know some of my

4

colleagues don't think there is.

But both of you have

5

proceeded in your briefing as if there is.

6

how you win?

7

MR. DUPREE:

Do you care

Well, yes, Your Honor, I think

8

we do.

9

that, with regard to Your Honor's points about issues

I think we do.

And let me say this:

I think

10

being waived or forfeited below, the only issue that

11

even arguably ­­ even arguably was forfeited below was

12

the discrete question as to whether Mercedes Benz itself

13

is subject to general jurisdiction in California.

14

The question that Justice Kagan and others

15

were inquiring about, namely, that even were one to

16

accept the attribution theory and evaluate Daimler as a

17

joint enterprise, would that render the combined

18

enterprise at home in California, we plainly did not

19

waive or forfeit that question.

20

In fact, we expressly addressed it in our

21

opening brief, and we have been fighting in this case,

22

from day one, to argue that, even if you were to

23

attribute the contacts, there is no basis for

24

jurisdiction over Daimler.

25

presented for this Court's review.

That question is squarely

56

I also think that ­­ as Justice Ginsburg and

2

others have noted, there has been some confusion in the

3

lower courts over the distinction between specific

4

jurisdiction and general jurisdiction.

5

it in Goodyear, for example, and I think that, were this

6

Court to resolve this case on the ground that Justice

7

Kagan suggested ­­ or Justice Alito suggested, namely,

8

that a corporation cannot be at home outside of the

9

areas where it maintains its principal place of business

This Court saw

10

or is incorporated, that it can't be subject to general

11

jurisdiction anywhere else.

12

That would be a clean rule.

It would be a

13

workable rule.

14

the Court said in Goodyear, and it would provide clarity

15

and guidance to the lower courts and eliminate the

16

circuit split that currently exists over agency

17

jurisdiction.

18

I think it's fully consistent with what

A couple other quick points, Justice Scalia,

19

I regret to report that neither the parties nor the

20

courts below reproduced the text of the California

21

statute.

22

did on page 4 of his brief.

23

"California may exercise jurisdiction on any basis not

24

inconsistent with the Constitution of California or the

25

United States."

The Solicitor General, however, to his credit,
It simply says that,

And the Ninth Circuit panel, on page 19A of

2

the Petitioner's appendix, said that, therefore, the

3

question is this case ­­ in this case is simply whether

4

the exercise of jurisdiction would exceed the

5

permissible bounds of due process.

6

The last point I want to make ­­ and we've

7

been discussing legal issues ­­ is just to remind the

8

Court of the facts of this case.

This case has no

The Ninth Circuit's contrary conclusion is

15

indefensible, and for that reason, we ask that the

judgment be reversed.
