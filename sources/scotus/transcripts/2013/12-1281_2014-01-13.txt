General Verrilli?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The interpretation of the Recess

12

Appointments Clause that Respondent urges would

13

repudiate the constitutional legitimacy of thousands of

14

appointments by presidents going back to George

15

Washington, and going forward, it would diminish

16

presidential authority in a way that is flatly at odds

17

with the constitutional structure the Framers

18

established.

19

Respondent simply has not advanced the

20

compelling case that would be needed to strip Presidents

21

of their traditional authority to make appointments

22

during intra­session recesses and to fill preexisting

23

vacancies.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You say ­­ you say

that it would repudiate the constitutionality of

appointments.

2

actions of those appointees would be invalid going back

3

4

You don't suggest that those ­­ the

GENERAL VERRILLI:

No, but they ­­ no, I

5

don't, Mr. Chief Justice, but it certainly would

affect the ­­ how many board decisions will have to be

10

redone, or how did ­­ how is the board coping with that

11

problem?

12

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, there are many

13

dozens of board decisions and, perhaps, many hundreds of

14

board decisions that are under a cloud as a result of

15

the D.C. Circuit's ruling in this case.

16

board will have a considerable amount of work to do

17

in ­­ if the D.C. Circuit's decision were to be

18

affirmed.

19

And so the

Now, there would be issues about waiver,

20

there'll be issues about whether there ­­ there is

21

authority sufficient to justify what the board did under

22

other circumstances or apparent authority arguments.

23

that would all have to be sorted out with respect to the

24

board's ruling ­­

including appointments during intra­session recesses and

offices of great importance.

Is that the way

But the word "happens"

may not always be an apt phrase, the phrase "may

7

happen," the constitutional phrase, but it is a natural

8

use.

9

counterexample.

10

And if I may, Justice Alito, I'll give you a

If Congress had enacted a statute in the

11

summer of 2008 that said the Federal Reserve is invested

12

with all powers necessary to deal with any financial

13

emergency that may happen in 2009, if that emergency

14

first arose in November of 2008, I don't think anybody

15

would interpret that statute as denying the Federal

16

Reserve the authority that Congress conferred.

17

And that's because "may happen" ­­ "may

18

happen" won't cover every situation of a persisting

19

state, but it's certainly a natural reading of it that

20

covers some.

interpreted to mean ­­

position is that it can be an intra­session recess.

was the vision of a long recess running for months, and

9

today, the inter­session recess might be momentary.

10

So what do we do with that?

GENERAL VERRILLI:

There

So I think I have two

11

points to make in response to the question of what to

12

do.

13

understanding, we do think that the term "recess" and

14

the phrase "the recess" certainly, at the time of the

15

founding, did encompass recesses that occurred during a

16

session of Congress, during a session of a

17

legislature, and not just in between sessions of the

18

legislature.

19

The first one is that, with respect to the original

I would point the Court to Jefferson's

20

Manual of Parliamentary Procedure, which describes a

21

recess by adjournment as occurring within a session.

22

would point to the Adjournment Clause itself, which says

23

if the ­­ one house of Congress wants to take a break of

24

longer than 3 days during the session, it needs the

25

consent of the other house, which indicates that the

10
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official

1

Framers contemplated the possibility of a break longer

2

than 3 days.

3

I would point the Court to the parliamentary

4

practice of the House of Commons, where the speaker of

5

the House of Commons had authority to call elections

6

when a member died during the recess.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, of course, Justice

8

Ginsburg's question points out that your argument is, it

9

seems to me, in search of a limiting principle.

A lunch

break, a one­day break ­­ you've ­­ you've thought about

11

this ­­ a 3­day break, a 1­week break, a 1­month break;

12

how do you resolve that problem for us?

13

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I think the ­­ the way we

14

resolve that problem is by looking to the Adjournment

15

Clause.

16

short, that it wouldn't require the ­­ wouldn't require

17

the one House to get the consent of the other, but

is in thinking about the length of the recess.

formal dictionary definition of "recess" at the time of

you're not answering the real thrust of the Chief

Justice's question, which is that we could just be back

here if we ­­ if we said, well, they didn't phrase this

20

in the right way.

21

Well, they'll phrase it differently, and we

22

would be back here with the same essential problem, that

23

you're asking us to peg this on a formality that the

24

Senate could easily evade, and that suggests that it

25

really is the Senate's job to determine whether they're

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

in recess or whether they're not.
GENERAL VERRILLI:

I think there has to be a

3

limit to that point, Justice Kagan, because, after all,

4

what we're talking about here is a power that the

5

Constitution gives to the President, the power in

6

Article II, and the President has got to make the

7

determination of when there's a recess.

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But why?

You're making

9

an assumption, which is that the Senate has to take a

10

recess, but the Senate could choose, if it wanted to,

11

and I think there might be some citizens that would

12

encourage it to, to never recess.

the other part of the Constitution, which says they

12

can't adjourn for more than 3 days without the approval

13

of the House, which they didn't have.

And what do you think about

14

So are you saying that the Senate violated

15

those other two amendments of ­­ the two parts of the

16

Constitution, or are you saying that they have different

17

meanings in the three parts?

18

19

it's hard to see how the ­­ what the ­­ what the Senate

20

did with pro forma sessions complies with either and ­­

Clause of the Constitution.

Now, that's one way to interpret it.

Over a

5

long period of time, they have apparently met pro forma

on those days.

requirements that apply only internally to the Congress.

Let me start with practicalities and with

8

the happens point, the "may happen" point, that our

9

appendix doesn't purport to be comprehensive or anything

10

like comprehensive.

11

comprehensive is that there really aren't records of

12

when the vacancy first arose with respect to huge

13

numbers of recess appointments, and that's because, I

submit, it wasn't considered material.

That

10

going ­­ going back to President Reagan, Presidents of

11

both parties, essentially, have used this clause as a

12

way to deal ­­ not with congressional absence, but with

13

congressional intransigence, with a Congress that simply

14

does not want to approve appointments that the President

thinks ought to be approved?

You know, absence in this day and age ­­

Yes, as a result of

GENERAL VERRILLI:

And that gets to the

7

second point, which is that it may be true, as a matter

8

of raw power, that the Senate has the ability to sit on

9

nominations for months and years at a time, but that is

10
11

100 miles from what the Framers would have expected.
If you look at what Hamilton said in

12

Federalist 76 about the advice and consent role of the

13

Senate, he said he thought it would be a power that was

14

rarely exercised and would operate, if at all, invisibly

GENERAL VERRILLI:

valve given that intransigence, and that is actually

quite consistent ­­

this is an aggressive assertion of executive authority,

2

And what the Framers were most concerned

3

about was that Congress, in the separation of powers

4

calculus, was going to amass authority and drain

5

authority and energy from the Executive, and therefore,

6

the Executive needed to be fortified against those

7

actions by Congress.

8

And one specific way in which the Framers

9

decided to fortify the Executive was by rejecting the

10

notion that the appointment power should reside with the

13

The Framers considered that, and they rejected

me the Framers made a different judgment because they

gave the President both the power to call back in

to look to history and the development of an equilibrium

with respect to Congress's definition of its own power

4

to determine whether they are in recess or not.

5

In other words, your third argument about

questions 1 and 2 would be of great importance to the

14

here's why:

equilibrium with respect to the use of pro forma

There isn't a long history reflecting the

of the Congress.

which both houses have chosen to consent to an

adjournment?

25

GENERAL VERRILLI:

No, I don't think so

29
Alderson Reporting Company

because the dictionary definition then and now of recess

is a suspension of business.

to ­­ putting the pro forma issue aside for a second,

18

session, because you can have ­­ you can have recesses

19

by adjournment, as Jefferson's parliamentary manual

20

said.

21

And as I think I said earlier, there is

22

quite substantial evidence that the term "the recess" at

23

the time of the framing could refer to a break during a

24

session and not just breaks between sessions.

25

don't think there is contemporaneous evidence from the

Ford, making no mid­session recess appointments.

What happened in that

First, of course, the third

JUSTICE BREYER:

The third question, by the

10

way, just put in your mind, if you digress in your

11

answer, put in your mind what would have happened in

12

1830 if someone, when they had a 9­month recess, close

13

to 10 months, someone had the bright idea, well, you

14

live near Washington; go show up at wherever we are

15

holding our sessions and sit there for 5 minutes, and

16

we'll stop President Andrew Jackson from making recess

17

appointments.

18

What would we be saying then?

MR. FRANCISCO:

Sure.

Well, I will put my

19

finger on that question and answer your first question

20

first as to the Pay Act in 1940.

21

in our view, clearly repudiates the government's

22

inter­session view for the reason you put your finger

23

on.

24

before or after the session ends.

25

The Pay Act of 1940,

It ties pay to appointments being made either right

So most mid­session recess appointees can't

get paid under the Pay Act.
With respect to the second question

3

presented, at best it creates three exceptions to the

4

5

appointees, so you have got somewhat of a compromise.

6

would say that is no more Senate acquiescence in the

9

If you reject our argument on the second

10

question, then I do think that you may need to confront

11

the notion that an inter­session recess is too short to

12

make recess appointments.

13

because here the appointments came on January 4th, the

14

day after Congress commenced the second session.

15

anyone's definition, this was an intra­session recess

16

appointment, not an inter­session recess appointment.

Not at issue in this case,

So by

And all of this really reflects the fact

18

that the Recess Appointments Clause is a contingent

power that arises only when the Senate triggers it,

20

which is what gives the Senate the power to prevent the

21

President from making recess appointments.

8
9

It's ­­ in a sense, the Recess Appointments
Clause is of a piece with the Inferior Officer's Clause.

10

The Senate always has the power of advice and consent,

is authorize the President to act unilaterally in

certain circumstances.

It can authorize the President to act

So if those facts show that there was a

3

Senator who actually gaveled them into session each day,

4

and that during that period they were capable of

5

conducting business, as they were here at every session

the Senate is the period between when the Senate says

how it begins a new one.

17

though, is it has to communicate that to the President.

So, for example, during President Madison's

committee to the President to inform this President that

21

The Senate could show up every day for an

13
14
15
16

Thank you, counsel.

FOR SENATE REPUBLICAN LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL, ET AL.,
AS AMICI CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS
MR. ESTRADA:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

17

As Justice Kagan recognized earlier in the

18

argument, this case fundamentally is about who gets to

19

decide whether the Senate is in recess, the Senate or

20

the President?

21

gets to decide whether the Senate is in recess.

22

Our submission today is that the Senate

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Estrada, you said in

23

your brief that that was true within wide limits.

24

are the wide limits?

25

MR. ESTRADA:

What

This is ­­ this is all about

67
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

how the Senate chooses to arrange its affairs, Justice

2

Kagan, under the Rules of Proceedings Act.

3

And what the Court said in the Ballin case

4

was that the exercise of rulemaking authority by

5

Congress was almost absolute and beyond the challenge of

6

any body or tribunal unless it usurped some independent

7

constitutional authority.

8
9

The only possible offer here that the
Solicitor General has as to how the Constitution could

10

have been violated by the actions of the Senate in

11

arranging its own affairs is the notion that this has

12

invaded the purported recess appointments power of the

13

President.

14

And the reason, as we say in our brief, why

15

that is completely insubstantial is because, as the

16

Solicitor General recognizes in the closing two pages of

17

its brief, the Senate by the design of the Constitution,

18

the Appointments Clause, the primary method of

19

appointment, has an absolute veto over nominations.

20

The Framers could not have been more clear

21

that the standard power of appointment was a joint power

22

of appointment.

23

forced to concede that this appointment power, this

24

right that the President is asserting here as a stop on

25

the exercise of the rulemaking authority, is a

And therefore, the Solicitor General is

5

6

be permissible?

MR. ESTRADA:

If the Senate says, we're

20

implication that the Solicitor General makes in his

21

brief, that the Senate, as a body, doesn't have a view

22

23

For the reason that I started out by

On

1

which no one really has litigated, as to whether there

2

was, in fact, an inter­session recess, whether the first

3

session of the 112th Congress ended on the morning of

4

January 3rd and therefore, we have the same Teddy

5

Roosevelt situation, or whether by adjourning on

6

December 30th and contemplating no further meetings

7

until January 3rd, whether that in effect ­­ in effect

8

was a sine die adjournment that ended the first session

9

of the Congress.

10

If the President had the same view about the

11

nature of the pro forma sessions, he could have taken

12

the view about the sessions between December 17th and

13

January 3rd and could have had a better legal argument

14

in attempting to claim that between December 30th and

15

January 3rd, there was at least an arguable

16

inter­session recess.

17

And he did not do that.

Why didn't he?

Because by waiting until the

18

convening of the first session ­­ of the second session

19

of the 112th Congress, by making an appointment on

20

January 4th instead of the morning of January 3rd, he

21

gives an extra year to his appointees to serve.

22

shows that this is, indeed, the bottom of the slippery

23

slope on the Recess Appointments Clause.

24
25

It is a complete abuse of the process.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Thank you,

79
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

Mr. Chief Justice.
Let me begin with a couple of points on

3

intra­session recesses.

4

that Justice Alito raised, it would have been perfectly

5

familiar to the Framers that a legislative body could

6

take an intra­session recess.

7

manual written while he was Vice President and presiding

8

over the Senate specifically refers to recesses by

9

adjournment that occur within a session and the session

10

With respect to the question

Jefferson's parliamentary

resumes when they are over.

11

The adjournment clause itself contemplates

12

the need for approval by the other branch for a period

13

longer than three days during the session.

14

I think it's difficult to imagine that if,

15

as Justice Alito's hypothetical suggested, that the

16

Senate had in the first years under President Washington

17

decided to take a two­month, intra­session break, that

18

President Washington wouldn't have been able to staff

19

the offices of the fledgling republic using the recess

20

appointment power.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if we agree with you

22

on the first question, then there needs to either

23

be a number or a functional test.

24

where the number would come from and I don't know how

25

the functional test would play out, so maybe you could

80
Alderson Reporting Company

And I don't know

Official

say just a word about that.

2

GENERAL VERRILLI:

We think the number

3

should ­­ should be the number in the Adjournments

4

Clause, 3 days or less.

5

restraint and there haven't been recess appointments in

6

periods below 10 days, but we think that would be the

7

line.

8
9

Now, Presidents have exercised

Now ­­
JUSTICE ALITO:

The presence

of that in the Adjournments Clause but the absence of

10

any number in the Recess Appointments Clause, how do you

11

explain that?

12

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, I think that there

13

isn't really a need for explanation.

14

suspension of business, and what the Adjournment Clause

15

says is if you are gone for 3 days or less you are not

16

really suspending your business, but if you are gone for

17

more than 3 days you are.

18

consistent with the argument that my friends on the

19

other side are making.

20

A recess is a

And I think that is quite

Now, with respect to the history on

21

intra­session recess appointments, really if you look at

22

the congressional directory, which is a document that we

23

cite in our brief, and you just look at the column that says

24

intra­session recesses, you will see page after page of

25

blank space until you get to the Civil War era when

81
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

intra­session recesses become more frequent.
And intra­session recess appointments really

3

just precisely parallel the increasing use by the Senate

4

of intra­session recesses.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And you argue that

6

the Senate sort of acquiesced in that and everybody's

7

come together, but what would you expect a Senator to do?

8

GENERAL VERRILLI:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, if they ­­
You know, the

10

President appoints somebody during a recess contrary to

11

the Respondent's view, what's the Senator who objects to

12

that supposed to do?

13

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, a couple of things

14

about that, Mr. Chief Justice.

15

was first enacted in this period, in the 1860s, when the

16

first intra­session recess appointments occurred. The Pay Act,

17

even in its original form never said ­­ and since,

18

never said anything about trying to restrict

19

intra­session appointments.

20

The Pay Act, of course,

If the Congress felt that these were

21

improper, they could have done what they did in the

22

Tenure of Office Act and passed a statute of making it a

23

crime for somebody to take one of these appointments.

24

But they didn't do anything like that.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you would

82
Alderson Reporting Company

would certainly be a question of disagreement, and it

15

didn't happen.

16

says we don't agree with your recess appointment, and you

18

say, well, that’s too bad, the appointee is still in

19

office.

20
21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, some of the Senators did ­­

Senator Byrd ­­

83
Alderson Reporting Company

to the President's assertion of that power.
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yeah, but he famously

3

objected to it, Mr. Chief Justice, by saying that the

4

intra­session recess ought to be 30 days or longer, not

5

that intra­session recesses are inappropriate as a

6

matter of constitutional power.

7

So I actually think that is just haggling

about the length of the recess, not about the existence

of the power.
