CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Our first case this

term is Case 12­872, Madigan v. Levin.

5

Mr. Scodro?

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. SCODRO

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

MR. SCODRO:

9

please the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

Congress has crafted a comprehensive body of

11

administrative and judicial procedures and remedies that

12

are tailored specifically to combatting discrimination

13

against older workers.

14

and remedies to government employees, Congress did not

15

intend to permit State and municipal workers alone to

16

frustrate this regime or bypass it entirely using the

17

more general remedies of Section 1983.

In extending these procedures

18
19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Scodro, there's a

20

preliminary question before we get to the question you

21

presented, and that is, what authority did the Seventh

22

Circuit have to deal with the question under the Age

23

Discrimination Act?

24

Seventh Circuit on interlocutory review ­­

25

MR. SCODRO:

I mean, it was ­­ it went to the

That's correct.

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

­­ a qualified immunity

2

question.

3

immunity, that there ­­ that there is, indeed, a claim

4

that the Equal Protection Clause includes age.

5

Second ­­ Seventh Circuit had no authority to deal with

6

any question other than that, did it?

7

Everybody agrees that there is no qualified

MR. SCODRO:

It did, Your Honor.

So

The

8

Seventh Circuit properly followed this Court's holding

9

in Wilkie.

In footnote ­­ in footnote 4 of that

10

opinion, the Court concluded correctly that whether or

11

not there was a Bivens action for a recognized ­­ in

12

that case, due process violation, was itself part and

13

parcel of the first prong of the qualified immunity

14

inquiry and, therefore, properly considered on

15

interlocutory ­­

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But in Wilkie, the whole

17

case was dismissed by the district court, wasn't it?

18

whatever was said in that footnote was dicta.

19

MR. SCODRO:

Your Honor, there's an argument

20

in one of the amicus briefs that the ­­ there was an

21

alternative route under 1254 in Wilkie and ­­ and,

22

therefore, the argument is raised that it was dicta.

23

But it wasn't dicta in context, Your Honor.

24

didn't consider that alternative route.

25

So

The court squarely held that it had

4
Alderson Reporting Company

The court

Official

1

jurisdiction, and that ­­ it goes on to say in the

2

footnote that the appellate court properly exercised

3

jurisdiction because the question of whether there is or

4

is not a Bivens action for this constitutional right is

5

properly considered part of the QI in ­­

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Now, we have an amicus brief

7

from law professors who argue that the Seventh Circuit

8

should not have considered the question of whether there

9

was a cause of action under Section 1983.

But they also

10

go on to argue that we, nevertheless, have jurisdiction

11

to consider that question and that it is a ­­ a matter

12

of discretion for us to decide whether to do that.

13

that ­­ do you agree with that position?

14

MR. SCODRO:

Is

We do agree with that position.

15

They cite Clinton versus Jones, and they cite the

16

Fitzgerald decision for that position, Your Honor.

17

we would agree that ­­ while those may be modest

18

extensions of the holdings in those cases, we would

19

agree that this Court can exercise 2254 jurisdiction

20

over the question.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And

If we adopt that

22

formulation and that solution, is it as if we are

23

granting certiorari before judgment on an issue in our

24

own discretion?

25

MR. SCODRO:

Is that the way it works?
That's ­­ I think that ­­ no, I

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

think the Court would still fairly consider the ­­ the

2

Seventh Circuit's judgment on the issue, Your Honor.

3

And, again, I would ­­ I would return to ­­

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but how ­­ what's

5

the mechanism for us ­­ what's the rationale that we can

6

exercise jurisdiction where a court of appeals could

7

not?

Because we have ­­

8

MR. SCODRO:

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

Well ­­
­­ authority to grant

certiorari before judgment or for some other reason?

11

MR. SCODRO:

The theory advanced in the

12

amicus brief, with which we confer, is that 1254 grants

13

the Court jurisdiction over the case, and that would

14

include issues like this that were part and parcel of

15

the case before the appellate court.

16

Now, I should note that that amicus brief

17

begins with the false premise that there was an exercise

18

of pendent appellate ­­ appellate jurisdiction in this

19

case.

20

the one reference ­­ the sole reference to pendent

21

appellate jurisdiction on Page 7­A of the Petitioner's

22

appendix is merely a reference or a brief description of

23

the failed argument advanced by the Respondent that

24

pendent jurisdiction would not be a proper proceeding

25

here.

And, as we explained briefly in our reply brief,

6
Alderson Reporting Company

3

And the Court did not advance.

They ­­ they

squarely cited Wilkie and advanced along the ­­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could ­­ could I go back,

4

Mr. Scodro, to the ­­ to the rationale of ­­ of the ­­

5

that ­­ that you're relying on.

6

saying, "part and parcel."

7

parcel?

8

right and a remedy.

9

has been a violation of law.

I mean, you keep on

But how is it part and

That seems to allay the distinction between a

10

MR. SCODRO:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

There's one question whether there

Sure.
There's another question

12

whether a cause of action exists to remedy that

13

violation.

14

Why aren't those two separate inquiries?

MR. SCODRO:

Well, Your Honor, the Court, in

15

Wilkie, moved from one to the other in the footnote.

16

And I think that ­­

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

18

to explain it to me ­­

19

MS. SCODRO:

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I guess I'm asking you

Sure.

Sure ­­

­­ because that footnote is

21

about a sentence long.

22

these are part and parcel of each other?

23

MR. SCODRO:

So what's the theory as to why

Because a ­­ the Qualified

24

Immunity Doctrine itself arises out of Section 1983 in

25

Bivens, it would seem sensible, as a matter of first

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

principles, to consider whether or not there is such a

2

cause of action at all, at the outset, with the right to

3

interlocutory appeal, rather than, given the qualified

4

immunity as defense from litigation is ­­ and not just

5

judgment, rather than waiting until final judgment and

6

on a 1291 appeal, then addressing for the first time on

7

appeal.

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, that seems a different

9

argument, not that the two really are intertwined with

10

each other, but it ­­ that it just might make sense to

11

consider the one at the outset, even though, in fact,

12

it's a separate inquiry.

13

MR. SCODRO:

I think ­­ and I want to be

14

clear ­­ I think there are two different rationales here.

15

When discussing why it's ­­ Wilkie was correct in what

16

it said in footnote 4, I would submit my most recent

17

answer, namely, that it's part and ­­ it is ­­ not part

18

and parcel, but it is natural and rational to ­­ to

19

consider whether or not the cause of action exists at

20

the outset.

21

With regard to ­­

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, if you're correct

23

that the two are one and the same, how ­­ how is it that

24

we have authorized district courts to do the one or the

25

other?

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

We ­­ we have not required district courts

2

to reach the merits if they're ­­ if they can resolve

3

the question on ­­ on the basis of qualified immunity

4

alone.

5

necessarily part of the qualified immunity

6

determination?

7

Well, how can that be, if the merits are

MR. SCODRO:

Well, Your Honor, some of the

8

merits we know are part of it under the Court's decision

9

in Hartman, where the Court concluded that the absence

10

or the failure to properly plead an element is, indeed,

11

properly considered a part of the qualified immunity

12

inquiry.

13

And here, the ­­ what ­­ what Wilkie did

14

essentially, as I read it, is essentially add to that

15

line of cases the idea that the presence or not of the

16

Bivens action in that case, but logically speaking, the

17

Section 1983 action here would be ­­ would be

18

appropriately considered as part of the ­­ the first

19

prong of the traditional two­prong qualified immunity.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You're running up against

21

the Seventh Circuit in that respect because the Seventh

22

Circuit held that the existence of ­­ of an ­­ whether

23

ADEA was the exclusive remedy, that that was irrelevant

24

to the qualified immunity issue.

25

MR. SCODRO:

Your Honor, toward the end of

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the Court's opinion, it's true, the Court uses the

2

phrase that "it's irrelevant to the qualified immunity

3

inquiry."

4

In that context, I would submit the Court is

5

using the phrase "qualified immunity," and I think this

6

is clear in context, to refer as ­­ as lower courts

7

have, at times, done ­­ to the second prong; that is the

8

clearly established element of qualified immunity.

9

Earlier in the opinion, in the section

10

labeled "jurisdiction," the Court actually cites Wilkie

11

and makes clear that it's following Wilkie's command

12

that the presence or not of the Section 1983 action for

13

a recognized constitutional right is considered part of

14

the first prong.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

If the existence of a cause

16

of action could not be considered in an interlocutory

17

qualified immunity appeal, what would the effect be on

18

the defendant's right not to be tried, which is the

19

whole reason for allowing an interlocutory appeal in

20

qualified immunity cases?

21

Wouldn't it be the case that, if the

22

district court found that there was no qualified

23

immunity, then the case would have to be tried, and

24

only at the end of the case could it be determined

25

whether there actually was a cause of action?

10
Alderson Reporting Company

So you’d

have a trial, potentially, about nothing.
MR. SCODRO:

That ­­ that's correct, Your

3

Honor.

question, I think there ­­ or Justice Kagan's

5

question ­­ I apologize ­­ I think it was ­­ that ­­

immunity from suit.

8
9

In my earlier response to Justice Sotomayor's

This is immunity from litigation,

The decision was that

there was no qualified immunity.

And the question is,

10

having determined there was no qualified immunity,

11

should they have stopped there?

12

been a trial ­­ if there is no qualified immunity, then

13

they have no exemption from trial.

14

MR. SCODRO:

There wouldn't have

No, Your Honor.

To decide that

15

there isn't qualified immunity, the Court needs to

16

consider both prongs and resolve them both adverse to

17

the defendant.

18

Court here to consider the argument that there is no

19

Section 1983 action.

20

And, therefore, it was essential for the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm not sure you see the

21

distinction or ­­ or you're facing the distinction.

22

right not to be tried is one of qualified immunity.

23

MR. SCODRO:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

Correct.

The

But you can have a

constitutional violation and still not have a remedy,

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

which is what this question involves.
So how do we deal with the concept that

3

other people who have motions to dismiss that are denied

4

still undergo trials, still experience the expense, and

5

yet, we've said, repeatedly, an interlocutory appeal is

6

not warranted.

7

And so what makes it warranted here, where a

8

court has already said that there was a ­­ or at least

9

there's enough evidence to suggest a constitutional

10

violation and that a reasonable officer wouldn't have

11

believed his or ­­ a person would have believed his or

12

her conduct was appropriate?

13

MR. SCODRO:

Your Honor, with regard to that

14

question, I would return to the notion that is a matter

15

of first principles, given that qualified immunity is an

16

outgrowth of Section 1983.

17

was justified in Wilkie in treating the presence or not

18

of the cause of action.

19

The Court was very just ­­

This is a ­­ we're not talking about an

20

affirmative defense, for example, in the form of statute

21

of limitations as one example.

22

existence or not of the Bivens right in that case, in

23

the Section 1983 right here.

24
25

We're talking about the

It seems consistent with the fact that
qualified immunity exists as a defense against Section

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

1983 and Bivens to contemplate the existence or not of

2

that cause of action right at the threshold.

3
4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Maybe ­­ well, maybe you

better say a few words about the merits?

5

MR. SCODRO:

6

(Laughter.)

7

MR. SCODRO:

Thank you, Your Honor.

The ­­ the ADEA's remedial

8

regime has the two elements that this Court has looked

9

at, repeatedly, in determining whether a comprehensive

10

regime or a regime is sufficiently comprehensive to

11

displace more general Section 1983 ­­

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There's another

13

preliminary question, and that is, why are we talking

14

about the ADEA, when the district court held that the

15

ADEA doesn't cover Mr. Levin?

And there seems to be not

16

much of a dispute about that.

You're not arguing that

17

the ADEA does cover him, are you?

18

MR. SCODRO:

Well, we are ­­ we are arguing

19

that the ADEA's rights and remedies do apply to

20

Mr. Levin.

21

amendments ­­ as part of the Civil Rights Overhaul Act of

22

that year, the amendments in that Act extended, and it's

23

a section entitled "Coverage of previously exempt State

24

employees."

25

And the reason is that, in 1991, with the

It ­­ it extended ADEA rights and remedies

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to the previously exempt policymakers at other high

2

levels.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, has ­­ has the Court

4

ever held that an antidiscrimination statute that does

5

not provide any rights for a particular class of

6

plaintiffs, nevertheless, extinguishes the right of

7

action that those plaintiffs would have under Section

8

1983?

9

What if Mr. Levin were under 40 years old?

10

Would you say that his equal protection Section 1983

11

cause of action was extinguished by the ADEA?

12

MR. SCODRO:

13

And the reason ­­

14

No, we would not, Your Honor.

JUSTICE ALITO:

So what is the difference

15

between someone who's under 40 and someone who is not an

16

employee, within the meaning of the ADEA?

17

MR. SCODRO:

Sure.

And, again, we're

18

talking about the 1974 to 1991 period, just to be clear,

19

because, since '91, appointees and employees, alike,

20

are ­­ are ­­ have the full range of ADEA rights and

21

remedies.

22

During that period, under 40s ­­ as this

23

Court held in Cline, that workers under the age of 40

24

simply were not part of the social ill that Congress

25

aimed to redress.

They were concerned with the plight

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of the relatively older worker.

2

concluded in Cline that reverse discrimination is not

3

covered and, also, the explanation for why Congress drew

4

a line at age 40.

It's why the Court

5

Just as in Smith, for example, the Education

6

of the Handicapped Act didn't extend to cover all manner

7

of hurdles confronted by a disabled student.

8

focused solely on a single issue facing ­­ a

9

curricular issue facing these students.

It ­­ it

Undoubtedly,

10

those students not covered by it would have retained

11

their Section 1983 right, same with under­40 here.

12

Now, as to the ­­ the narrow exception that

13

existed between '74 and '91 for high­level government

14

policy ­­ policymakers, we have the EEOC's understanding

15

of why exactly Congress did that.

16

there was concern on the part of members of Congress

17

that it would be inappropriate from a matter of

18

federalism and operationally to have federal involvement

19

in the hiring decisions made by the highest members ­­

20

the elected members of state and local government.

21

that concern applies equally to Section 1983 claims.

22

They did so because

And

Because that concern applies equally ­­

23

we're not talking about people who weren't within the

24

scope of the social ill; we're talking about a

25

deliberate carveout for reasons that apply equally to

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Section 1983 ­­ we would submit that the exception,

2

likewise, would have had force during that interim

3

period.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why ­­

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

For some ­­ for ­­ please.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, why should we consider

7

that question?

8

before the enactment of the GERA, yes, we would have to

9

consider that question.

If this ­­ if we were back in the era

But now that the new statute

10

has been passed, why should we consider whether someone

11

who was a non­employee lacked a ­­ a 1983 cause of

12

action during the period when that ­­ prior to the

13

enactment of that statute?

14

MR. SCODRO:

You're actually ­­ absolutely

15

correct, Your Honor.

16

there is no need for the Court to confront that question

17

in this case.

As we say in our reply brief,

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

MR. SCODRO:

Which question?

The question of whether or not,

20

between 1974 and 1991, exempt employees ­­ those who

21

then obtained ADEA rights in 1991, whether those

22

employees could be ­­ their Section 1983 claims could

23

have been displaced by ­­ notwithstanding the fact that

24

they were carved out.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I think the point here

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is that Mr. Levin is covered not by the ADEA, but by a

2

separate statute, the GERA.

3

question whether the GERA would displace constitutional

4

relief, which apparently has ­­ has never been argued to

5

anybody in this case.

6

MR. SCODRO:

And there's a separate

Two points, Your Honor.

First,

7

as we explain in reply and in ­­ in our opening brief,

8

the GERA is properly considered merely a part of the

9

broader remedial regime under the ADEA, and we explain

10

why to look at it otherwise would create all sort of

11

manner of artificialities.

12

It's ­­ it's ­­ we know, from past statutes

13

like the Genetics Act that was passed more recently, the

14

way in which Congress would incorporate GERA by

15

reference instead of vice­versa.

16

example, in that same 1991 Act, 1981(a) was added and

17

provided punitive damages for a whole array of ­­

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

We know that, for

Well, there are some

19

similarities ­­ many similarities, between the ADEA and

20

the GERA, but there are also real differences.

21

they're obvious ­­ they obviously cover different

22

people; there are different procedural prerequisites for

23

the suit; you get a different kind of review, you only

24

get administrative review under the GERA.

25

So it's a separate inquiry as to whether

17
Alderson Reporting Company

I mean,

Official

1

this statute that has some commonalities, but some

2

differences, displaces constitutional claims, and it's

3

an inquiry that really has never been addressed in this

4

case.

5

MR. SCODRO:

And, Your Honor, to the extent,

6

if the Court has concerns about addressing that ­­ and,

7

again, I ­­ I'm happy to go on as to why it would be

8

artificial to consider the two separately.

9

But if the Court were to conclude that,

10

rather than an ­­ effectively amending the ADEA, that

11

the GERA amendments in 1991 really created a whole new

12

statute that needs to be considered independent, the

13

proper remedy would not be to dismiss this appeal, but

14

would be to vacate the Seventh Circuit's judgment to

15

permit Respondent to raise a claim that is new to this

16

case on the merits here; namely, that there are

17

different rules for appointees than employees.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This is an ­­ the

19

qualified immunity question is presented on

20

interlocutory appeal.

21

MR. SCODRO:

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It is, Your Honor.
Decisions on the

23

merits, factual and legal, are still pending.

24

now, we have a determination by the district court that

25

Mr. Levin is not an employee.

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Now ­­

Official

1

MR. SCODRO:

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.
The prior district

court determined that he was.

4

that he was an employee in their complaint.

5

depending upon how we rule on the qualified immunity

6

issue, the parties may want to revisit their positions

claims based on gender or race or other things, right?

Well, every circuit in the country has said

So are we supposed to read GERA, it goes this way in

MR. SCODRO:

Your Honor, the Seventh Circuit

25

appointees and employees.

The reason for that was the

11

whether the ADEA applies and in what way to a person to

12

whom it doesn't apply, assuming that GERA is, in fact, a

13

separate statute that you have to sue under, the answer

14

to which I do not know and which has never been argued.

15

MR. SCODRO:

Your Honor, there's very little

16

lower court authority on the effect of GERA.

17

that what courts have done for I ­­ there is a case, for

18

example, in which the allegation was Title VII as

19

amended in 1991, and the Court construed that,

20

naturally, to include the GERA rights.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

I will say

And so, if there's so

22

little about it, sometime, on occasion, we dismiss a

case as improvidently granted, which is not a

MR. SCODRO:

Your Honor, to reiterate a

2

point made just a few moments ago, I think that the

3

proper resolution, if ­­ GERA and the ADEA, again, are

4

really one remedial regime.

5

pointed out 1981(a) as an example of a ­­ of a similar

6

regime, where punitive damages were added to a number

7

of statutes.

8
9

And ­­ and I've ­­ I've

And yet, if we considered any one of those
statutes today, we would agree that it includes punitive

10

damages, even though it was added in a freestanding

11

statute as part of the 1991 Act.

12

But, again, I would say, as a procedural

13

matter, should the Court harbor concerns about this

14

issue and wish to permit the claim that appointees and

15

employees are entitled to different displacement rules

16

and the counterargument that, no, they're not because

17

GERA effectively amends and adds to the ADEA, the way to

18

handle that procedurally would be to vacate the judgment

19

below and to let the parties argue those points to that

20

court.

21

As it stands, the Seventh Circuit was asked

22

to issue a broad pronouncement that is indifferent to

23

whether ­­ the Seventh Circuit was well aware and states

24

that Mr. Levin was subject to an interlocutory

25

determination that he was an appointee.

22
Alderson Reporting Company

1

And the court went on ­­ and the only

2

relevance that had in the court's analysis, based on the

3

way it was framed below, is that, well, because

4

appointees and people under 40 and other categories

5

appear to be carved out ­­ and we have answers to all of

6

those in our briefs in response ­­ but because all of

7

them appear to be carved out, the ADEA does not

displace, ever, as to appointees or employees.

That doesn't contemplate a new argument that

We've set forth that the Court should look at preclusion

with two questions.

13

preclusion, is under Sea Clammers.

14

The first question, under

Sea Clammers was a case where they passed a

15

new statute with the new right and had an enforcement

16

provision in the statute, and the issue was whether or

17

not, under Sea Clammers, the Congress intended to

18

preclude 1983 to enforce that statute.

19

came to the conclusion, yes, that it would be

20

inconsistent to use 1983 with that statute.

And the Court

21

The second standard that the Court has used

22

is under Smith v. Fitzgerald, which is applicable here,

23

if we're looking at whether the ADEA precludes somebody

24

covered by the ADEA.

25

rights?

5

provision in the new statute to be the sole exclusive

6

remedy of the preexisting independent constitutional

MR. THEOBALD:

If you had a claim under

10

GERA or anything else, under their analysis, it doesn't

12

MR. THEOBALD:

I think we could read the

13

opinion that way, but they certainly were aware that

14

Mr. Levin was not covered.

15

since Mr. Levin has been excluded, before the Seventh

16

Circuit and before this Court, they used the terms

17

"exhaustion," "not exhausting remedies," and they used

18

the word "avoids the scheme," "avoids the ADEA."

19

The ­­ the State has argued,

So ­­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Let ­­ let's assume that

10

the question that was presented is before us.

11

you ­­ you have argued Fitzgerald.

The other side says

12

Smith v. Robinson should control.

So why shouldn't the

13

Handicapped Act decision control?

That, like the ADEA,

14

has allowed procedural parts that wouldn't be included

15

in an equal protection claim.

16

MR. THEOBALD:

And

We believe, Your Honor, that

17

those two cases are the second standard.

18

we ­­ we agree with the standard in Smith.

19

the standard with Fitzgerald.

20

Smith, what that case was about was the Education for

21

All Handicapped Act, whether that Act precluded the use

22

of 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the statutory claim,

23

and whether it precluded 1983 constitutional claims.

24

And the Court in Smith v. Fitzgerald said

25

The Smith ­­
We agree in

And the standard in

that it did because there was no ­­ the EHA, the

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

remedies and the procedures there was not for a de novo

2

review in court, so the plaintiff's claim was precluded.

3

We have no problem with the Smith standard.

4

But the Court also said, in Smith, that if

5

there are matters that are offered to the children, the

6

disability of the disabled children or their parents

7

under the EHA that that doesn't cover, those things, if

8

they're offered to parents and if they're offered in a

9

discriminatory manner or denied for discrimination,

10

those claims can be brought under the 1983 equal

11

protection claims or under Section 504 of the

12

Rehabilitation Act, the ­­ the preexisting statutory

13

claim.

14

So applying that to the ADA, there is no

15

evidence that in passing the ADA, for covered

16

individuals, that Congress intended to preclude the

17

preexisting 1983 equal protection claim, so our second

18

standard in our brief is the Smith­Fitzgerald standard.

19

In Fitzgerald, the Court went further and explained, if

20

the rights and protections of the statute that is

21

seeking to be ­­ precluding are different than the equal

22

protection claim, then there is no preclusion.

23

And here, the rights and protections between

24

the ADA and the equal protection through 1983 are

right.

13

itself.

Your Honor, Smith ­­ as we

51

the proposition that the lodestar inquiry ­­ and I think

4

the word "primary emphasis" or that phrase may be used

5

in Fitzgerald to describe the comprehensiveness of the

6

regime as the first and most important inquiry.

7

After that, Smith makes clear that we are

8

allowed to consider if there is a comprehensive regime,

9

whether there is contrary evidence in the face of the

10

legislative history, as there is, for example, for

11

Title VII, not so for the ADEA.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But why ­­ if the ADEA is

13

expanding the Civil Rights protection against age

14

discrimination much more generous to the employee, isn't

15

it strange to think that Congress, at the same time,

16

wanted employees to have these expanded rights and to do

17

away with the preexisting remedy?

18

MR. SCODRO:

19

When Congress provided the expanded right,

No, Your Honor, not at all.

20

they recognized that there were characteristics

21

particular to age discrimination that warranted very low

22

damages awards and a procedural predicate that would

23

emphasize swift and informal dispute resolution.
