ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN J. LECHNER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LECHNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
If upheld, the decision below will upset

12

100 years of property law and title to perhaps a million

13

acres of land, based upon an implied reversionary

14

interest that the government recently created.

15

I would like to make three points:

First,

16

the decision below violates Leo Sheep, where this Court

17

rejected the government's attempt to create a property

18

interest through implication and reaffirmed that the

19

government does not retain any interest not expressly

20

reserved in the patent or the granting statute.

21

Two, the decision below is contrary to both

22

the government's argument and this Court's ruling in

23

Great Northern that 1875 Act rights­of­way are easements

24

and are not fees.

25

And finally, the decision below is

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

inconsistent with the Department of Interior's

2

longstanding interpretation that the 1875 Act granted

3

only an easement.

4

It is axiomatic that the highest evidence of

5

title in this country is a patent from the government.

6

When the government issues a patent, it divests itself

7

of title except for those interests expressly reserved.

8

Here, the patent did not reserve any interest in the

9

1875 Act ­­

10
11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Counsel, you are not

reading this, are you?

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

MR. LECHNER:

It's all right.
Here the patent did not

14

reserve any interest in 1875 Act right­of­way.

15

government knew how to reserve interests at that time

16

because it reserved the interest for ditches and canal,

17

and reserved the right to two Forest Service roads when

18

it issued the patent.

19
20
21

Yet the

That some interests were reserved by the
government in 1976 shows that other interests were not.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, under Section 1912,

22

the government could ­­ did reserve an interest for a

23

public highway; is that correct?

24

MR. LECHNER:

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

No.
No?

1

MR. LECHNER:

1912, Section 1912 has to be

2

read in conjunction with this Court's decision in

3

Northern Pacific v. Townsend, and Stringham.

4

those decisions, this Court held that railroad

5

rights­of­way were limited fees with implied

6

reversionary interests.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The patent you talk

8

about, I am not recalling it exactly.

9

mentioned the railroad interest, right?

10

MR. LECHNER:

And in

It had some ­­ it

Yes, it mentioned it in the

11

context of, that Brandt's title is subject to those

12

rights for railroad purposes as had been granted to the

13

railroad under the 1875 Act.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it didn't

15

characterize it as either an easement or a fee with an

16

implied reverter?

17

MR. LECHNER:

That it was subject to those

18

rights for railroad purposes as had been granted to the

19

railroad sounds like it was granted subject to a

20

servitude.

"Rights for railroad purpose" sounds like a

21

servitude.

And of course that's how the Department of

22

Interior interpreted it at the time, that these 1875

23

rights­of­way were easements, following its longstanding

24

interpretation plus this Court's ruling in Great

25

Northern that these were easements.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, that's nice.

But

Do you

know of any other real estate thing which says it's an

easement for one purpose and the fee for another?

that ­­ the argument that the government is making today

13

is similar to their alternative argument that they made

14

there in Great Northern, saying, okay, well, if it's not

15

an easement, then it's a limited fee in the surface.

16

This Court in Great Northern did not even

17

address that alternative argument, which shows how

18

strongly this Court in Great Northern believed it was

19

just an easement.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. LECHNER:

That's what ­­ that's what

16

must keep in mind that Section 912 did not alter or

1875 Act must be looked through the eyes of Congress in

19

1875.

20

But you

In 1922, when Congress passed Section 912,

21

Congress was grappling with what to do with these

22

isolated strips of land that would be administratively

23

burdensome to manage.

24

originally, they said, well, let's give them to the

25

settlers because they are the ones entitled to it in the

1875 Act or alter the amended grant.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, can you explain to

6

me something to me about that 1875 Act a little bit?

7

know that until 1871, these railroad rights­of­way were

8

considered to leave the government in the position of

9

having a reversionary interest.

17

MR. LECHNER:

There was an end to the giving

But what is there in

As the government argued in

18

Great Northern and as this Court adopted that argument,

19

the key provision in the 1875 Act is Section 4, which

20

reserved the right to Congress to dispose of the lands

21

underlying 1875 rights­of­way to settlers.

22

And this was a reflection of the change of

policy in 1871 because that's where the Congress changed

its policy to ­­ in an effort to secure homesteads to

5

MR. LECHNER:

Well, under ­­ under the 1875

6

Act, yes, Congress did provide for station grounds.

7

railroad could secure station grounds by filing a map of

8

the station grounds with the local land office, and once

9

the secretary approved, then they would acquire the

The

station grounds.
But the nature of the grant that they

12

required on the station grounds is the same as for the

13

right­of­way, and that's merely an easement.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Oh.

So it's ­­ so it was

15

clear at the time of the grant that it was on the ­­

16

that what was granted was co­extensive with what the

17

right­of­way was, with the railroad right­of­way.

18

MR. LECHNER:

Yes.

Department of Interior originally interpreted it in

1888, as the ­­ the railroad didn't get a fee in

A right to lay their tracks

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Just as I'm seeing the

MR. LECHNER:

Well, yes, and as the

that right in the 1875 Act was a right to lay tracks and

it was a right of passage, an easement.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Lechner, I know Great Northern said so

and that is surely very strong support for your

6

view.

7

difference between pre­1871 grants and post?

8
9

But why did Great Northern think that there was a

MR. LECHNER:
policy.

First, the shift in Congress's

And the railroads fell out of disfavor and

10

Congress passed resolution saying ­­ you know, we want

11

to hold on to these lands to secure homesteads for

12

actual settlers.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, I guess I had thought if you

14

were just dealing with this as a matter of first

15

impression that the shift in Congress's policy was a

16

shift about whether to give away ­­ you know, huge

17

swaths of land to the railroads, and that Congress

18

indeed decided, enough of this, we are not going to give

19

these checkerboard grants of land to the railroad,

20

because they are making a mint from this, and we would

21

rather give it to homesteaders.

22

But there was ­­ I don't see any evidence

23

that there was any shift in policy or any reason why

24

there would be a shift in policy, as to what the rights

25

of way were.

Whether they were easements or whether

20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

they were limited fees.

2

MR. LECHNER:

Well, Section 4 has a lot to

3

do with that, and that is where Congress reserved the

4

right to dispose of the underlying lands to the

5

settlers.

6

railroad grants, and this Court in Great Northern looked

7

at that and you say, you got to look at Section 4, that

8

provides light on how to interpret the right­of­way

9

grant in Section 1.

10

That provision is not found in the pre­1871

And because of Congress's intent and the

11

legislative history surrounding similar language when

12

Congress passed it in 1872, they called it the

13

right­of­way is merely going to be an encumbrance.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess ­­ you know, again,

15

if you were just looking at this as a matter of first

16

impression, the language of Section 4 does not seem to

17

me to be very indicative of anything.

MR. LECHNER:

You know, it says

Subject to the

But as the government argued

24

in Great Northern, it would be silly to patent the

25

underlying lands subject to a fee.

21
Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, there would

Official

1

be no reason for that language at all if the railroad

2

got a fee.

3

would be the adjacent land, not the underlying land.

4

There would be no reason to say that the adjacent land

5

is subject to a fee because with the limited fees, they

6

were envisioning those things going to the center of the

7

earth.

And then you patented the ­­ in effect it

8

So you would be patenting the adjacent land.

9

But under Section 4 and as Great Northern interpreted,

10

the patents go to the underlying land and that's what

11

happened in this case, because Brandt owns the

12

underlying land and minerals.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, in your answer it

14

seemed to me, and maybe you have to do this to proffer, that you

15

confused limited fee with fee simple ,with absolute fee.

16

Now, obviously that's true if it's the same owner, they

17

merge.

18

MR. LECHNER:

Well, I was using limited fee

19

in the context as this Court used it in Townsend,

20

limited fee with the implied condition of reverter.

21

mean, even in Townsend 1903, the railroad got it all,

22

but it was subject to implied condition of reverter if

23

they stopped using it for railroad purpose.

24

did give fee simple absolute to the center of the earth

25

is how it was construed at that time.

22
Alderson Reporting Company

I

But they

Official
1

So that sheds light on the fact that Section

2

4 reflects that only an easement was granted because you

3

would not need to have Subject 2 language at all if you

4

were just patenting the adjacent lands.

5

It is also well established that the Department of Interior’s

6

interpretation of public land laws such as the 1875 Act is

7

entitled to great deference.

8

land laws provide for the acquisition of the title,

9

which must be secure.

This is because public

Beginning in 1888 and

10

continuing through today, the Department of Interior

11

still construes the 1875 Act as easements and they can

12

still construe 1875 Act rights of way as different from

13

pre­1871.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't understand how that

15

can be, and yet, the government can argue contrary to

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

Mr. Yang, I have to say I

24

think the government gets a prize for understatement

25

with its brief in this case.

You have a sentence in

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

your brief that says, "We acknowledge that there is

2

language in this Court's opinion in Great Northern and

3

in the government's brief in that case that lends some

4

support to petitioner's contrary argument."

5

Here are the subject headings of the

6

government's brief in Great Northern.

7

granted by the Act of March 3, 1875, is in the nature of

8

an easement.

9

only an easement was granted.

"The right­of­way

The language of the 1875 Act shows that
The legislative

10

background and history of the 1875 Act show that the

11

grant was of an easement rather than a fee.

12

Subsequent administrative and congressional

13

construction confirm that only an easement was granted."

14

And the first sentence of the summary of the

15

argument ­­

16

MR. YANG:

There is also other portions of

17

the brief.

18

Footnote 4 where the government said there would be a

19

separate question raised about whether a patent holder

20

subsequently who obtains the patent after the grant of

21

right­of­way would take this government interest.

22

the Court ­­ the government said in fact that would

23

raise different questions.

24
25

I would refer the Court, for instance, to

And

The Court recognized that on pages ­­ the
last two pages of its opinion, it specifically limited

2

interest in the entire surrounding parcel and, in fact,

3

modified the judgment below which enjoined the railroad

4

from oil drilling simply to apply to that.

7

Not only that, the Court was writing on ­­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Wait, wait.

Before you go,

8

you really think the Court was saying, It will be an

9

10

something else when that suits the government?

11

MR. YANG:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, I think what the Court was ­­
I mean, it's either an

13

easement or it's not an easement.

14

the ­­ the opinion meant to reserve the question whether

15

it was an easement.

16

MR. YANG:

You really think

I do with respect to the issue

17

that we have here.

18

whether the right­of­way, which is a statutory term,

19

Congress could have used "easement"; it could have used

20

"fee."

21

which has accumulated meaning over time, particularly,

22

in the railroad context.

It did not.

The question before the Court was

It uses a special statutory term

And when Congress was stopping that ­­ that lavish grant

JUSTICE BREYER:

And then we went

All right.

Let me put it

this way.
MR. YANG:

And so, again, if we were to

10

rewrite our brief, we would certainly do so much more

11

carefully now.

12

the brief is the way that you read opinions, which is in

13

the context in which it was decided, particularly

14

because Footnote 4, and this Court's opinion responding

15

to Footnote 4, made clear that they were only addressing

16

mineral rights where the United States held the

17

surrounding parcel.

But I think that the way that you read

18

And ­­ and that's particularly true because

19

this Court had already construed Section 4 of the 1875

20

Act before Great Northern in Stalker and in Steinke.

21

And in Stalker, the Court held that the subject to ­­

22

this is on page 154 ­­ a patent was subject to the

23

railroad rights acquired by approval.

24

approval in Section 4, in the subject to language in

25

Section 4.

Alderson Reporting Company

That's the

Official

1

"Upon approval, the grounds so selected were

2

segregated from the public lands and the required

3

material to withdraw the land granted from the market."

4

And then the Court goes on, and this is on page 154

5

again, "The later patent," the patent issued to a

6

settler.

7

omitted to mark the right­of­way on the land plats, the

8

subsequent patent was inoperative to pass title to those

9

later patentholders.

10

Even though the local land office forgot to or

And then in Steinke ­­ this is 1922 ­­ the

11

Court followed Stalker and said, "The approved map under

14

inoperative to pass title.

And then they

And I think it's important, in both of those

16

cases, the Court cited to Interior's regulations.

17

Stalker, the Court quoted at length the regulations from

18

19

Northern those were the first regulations, they actually

20

weren't.

reading of the history here, Mr. Yang, is that it really

these rights of way had value as anything other than

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN J. LECHNER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LECHNER:

We do know how many acres are

10

involved in this case, and the government is claiming 10

11

of the 83 acres that it patented to Marvin Brandt's

12

parents.

13

As this Court has noted, stare decisis

14

concerns are ­­ in many cases involving property rights.

15

With respect to Stalker and Steinke, those were

16

pre­Great Northern; those were limited fee cases.

17

most, they stand for first in time, first in right.

18

At

Steinke was written by Justice Van Devanter

19

who also wrote Stringham, which Great Northern

20

overturned.

21

of use over the years.

22

so important, the government should have brought those

23

cases to the Court's attention in Great Northern, but it

24

didn't.

25

And that's why Stalker and Steinke fell out
And if Stalker and Steinke were

With respect to the 1931 land decision the

solicitor's opinion ­­

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

I guess it would be the

4

private parties that would have brought it up in Great

5

Northern, wouldn't it?

6

And do you have any light to shed on the

7

comparative amounts?

8

we know there are billions of dollars worth of takings

9

claims that will come out where the highways run, and

I mean, they're saying ­­ for all

10

you're arguing, of course, any reasonable property

11

lawyer would have relied on Great Northern to think it

12

was just conveying an easement.

13

But ­­ you know, I'm not a property lawyer,

14

and so what actually happened matters.

15

matter, at least to me.

And the amounts

I don't have any light to shed
We know it's thousands.

JUSTICE BREYER:

We know

What about on your side?

21

What about the possibility that millions of acres has

22

been conveyed and there are tens of thousands or

23

hundreds of thousands of abandoned railroads that

24

property lawyers thought went to the person who bought

25

them, and run through somebody's house?

54
Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, is that

Official

1

a figment of my imagination?

2

MR. LECHNER:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.
And you would say no, it

4

isn't, and therefore I'm asking you is there any

5

empirical support anywhere for how property lawyers have

6

treated Great Northern, how much was conveyed,

7

et cetera?

8

helpful.

9

Anything you can say on that would be

MR. LECHNER:

I have nothing to say about

10

the quantity, but I know that with S.C. ­­ the Seventh

11

Circuit ruled in S.C. Johnson that the title insurance

12

thought that was a landmark decision because it resolved

13

a lot of problems with the title insurance industry.

14

Each mile of the right­of­way takes up

15

24 acres.

16

Court noted in Preseault, there was 270,000 miles of

17

roads at the peak in the early 1920s and about 130 of

18

those had been abandoned by the time of the Preseault

19

decision.

20

At one point there were 270,000, as this

I want to also address the forfeiture

21

provision that they mention and Great Northern relied on

22

Section 43, 940, to confirm its conclusion that the S

23

and D, these are easements because 43 U.S.C. 940 calls

24

them an easement.

25

government still owned at the time of abandonment, they

And with respect to land that the

55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

said that the government's land would be discharged of

2

the easements.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is there any doctrine in

4

property law that if a right of access is granted and

5

its to the exclusion of all other uses, it's ­­ it looks

6

for all purposes like absolute control, that it ceases

7

to be an easement and becomes a limited fee?

8
9

I mean, is there some magic that takes place
in property law so that if there's a grant that conveys

10

such total control, that it construed not to be an

11

easement?

12

MR. LECHNER:

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

MR. LECHNER:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Have you even heard of the

term "limited fee" until this case?

I never heard it.
