ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

10

13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In promulgating the Transport Rule, EPA

14

sought to protect the public health and to strike a fair

15

balance between the competing interests of upwind and

16

downwind States.

17

basic steps.

18

EPA's analysis proceeded in three

First, EPA performed a screening analysis to

19

determine which upwind States would be covered by the

20

Transport Rule.

21

identified the downwind receptors that were in a State

22

of nonattainment or had maintenance difficulties, and

23

then it determined which upwind States were linked to

24

those receptors.

25

And in order to do that, EPA first

And in order to be linked to a downwind

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

receptor, the upwind State had ­­ had to contribute one

2

percent or more of the relevant National Air Quality ­­

3

Ambient Air Quality standard, or ­­ or NAAQS, to that

4

downwind receptor.

5

at least one percent to any of the downwind ­­ any of

6

the relevant downwind receptors was determined not to

7

contribute significantly to nonattainment at that area.

8
9

And any State that didn't contribute

Second, once the States that were to be
covered by the Transport Rule had been identified, EPA

10

set a State emissions budget for each State.

11

that, it performed computer modeling to determine, in

12

addition to whatever emission control efforts were

13

already going on, what additional emission reductions

14

could be achieved by implementation of control measures

15

available at various cost thresholds.

16

And to do

And the thresholds ultimately selected were,

17

for NAAQS, $500 per ton.

18

were at a level of $2,300 per ton.

19

were 5 ­­ $500 per ton.

20

emissions savings we can achieve, if additional control

21

measures are implemented up to those cost thresholds.

22

And ­­

23

For SO2, the group 1 States
The group 2 States

And the idea was let's see what

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, those ­­ those

24

savings would ­­ would not be evenly distributed among

25

the upwind States, right?

So some upwind States that

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

are able to make those efficient changes will be

2

carrying more than their burden of reducing the

3

emissions that affect downwind States, right?

4

MR. STEWART:

Well, there ­­ there were two

5

bases for distinguishing among the States.

6

in terms of the $500 per ton threshold for the group 2

7

States versus the $2,300 per ton threshold; the way in

8

which States were divided into those categories is that

9

the States that were linked to the downwind receptors

The first ­­

10

that had the most severe pollution problems were treated

11

as group 1 States, and they were required to make

12

greater pollution control efforts because they had some

13

responsibility for the most serious problems.

14

Now, I guess the point of your question

15

would go to ­­ to the fact that, even among States that

16

were operating under constant cost control thresholds, a

17

State that had already implemented cost measures up to

18

that limit might have to do less in a sense because it

19

would have already taken the ­­ the steps that were

20

required, at least as compared to an air­quality­only

21

threshold.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I don't mind a State

23

doing less.

24

you can use those cost figures to do less, and that's

25

not challenged here.

I think North Carolina said ­­ said that

But what the application of the

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

cost factor means is that some States that can more

2

efficiently make the changes will be required to do more

3

than merely account for their proportion of the downwind

4

harm.

Isn't that true?

5

MR. STEWART:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

Yes or no?

I mean, I think

it's an easy yes or no answer.

8
9

Well ­­

MR. STEWART:

I think it is ­­ no, I think

it is the case that, if you adopted an air­quality­only

10

threshold, then it would be more likely to be the case

11

that States that had already done a lot to control air

12

pollution would have to take additional steps, even if

13

it was done at a non­cost ­­ in a non­cost­effective

14

way.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Have you answered my

16

question?

17

what the statute says is that each upwind State has to

18

account for its ­­ its effect on the downwind States,

19

but once having identified that effect, you ­­ you then

20

say those upwind States that can make the reductions

21

more efficiently have to make more reductions than

22

they ­­ than their mere proportion of the harm requires.

23

Isn't that so?

24
25

Does ­­ does the fact that you begin with ­­

MR. STEWART:

I think it would be the case

that at least as ­­ yes, as compared to at least some

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

air­quality­only measures, the use of cost would have

2

the effect of distributing the burden in a somewhat

3

different way than it would have if you considered air

4

quality factors only.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Is the idea, Mr. Stewart,

6

that the States that are required to do more are the

7

States that haven't done much already?

8

MR. STEWART:

That's correct.

And that was

9

what I was trying ­­ trying to get out earlier, that

10

if ­­ if States have to do less in order to meet the

11

$500 ­­ in order to be in a position where they've

12

implemented all the cost ­­ all the emission control

13

measures that are available at $500 per ton, if a

14

particular State has to do less in order to achieve

15

that, it's probably because that State has already

16

implemented most of those measures on its own.

17
18
19
20
21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And what provision of the

statute allows you to take that into account?
MR. STEWART:

Well, the ­­ the term that

we're ­­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, as opposed to each

22

State, whether it's inefficient or efficient, has to

23

merely reduce its contribution to the downwind State

24

pollution, right?

25

MR. STEWART:

That's what the statute says.
Well, the statute says that

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

each State will adopt measures that prevent sources

2

within its borders from contributing significantly to

3

downwind nonattainment.

4

provision is not to allocate blame for an existing state

5

of nonattainment or for prior pollution.

And the purpose of the

6

It's a ­­ it's to devise a scheme that going

7

forward will prevent nonattainment from occurring.

8

the idea is, if each State lives up to its obligation

9

and if the downwind States make commensurate

10
11

And

commitments, then the problem will be solved.
And in terms of the language, "contribute

12

significantly," I think there are ­­ there are various

13

reasons to think that EPA reasonably construed that term

14

to include a component of difficulty of achievement;

15

that is, in common parlance, we might say that dunking a

16

basketball is a more significant achievement for

17

somebody who is 5 feet 10 than for somebody who is 6

18

feet 10.

19

We might say that a $100 charitable

20

contribution is more significant if it's made by a

21

person who makes $10,000 a year than a 1,000

22

contribution by somebody who makes $1 million a year.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's ­­ I was just

24

going to say, that just is because of, in the latter

25

case, because contribution happens to be used in both an

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

affirmative and a negative sense.

2

example, whether somebody who fatally stabs somebody and

3

someone who fatally shoots them have each significantly

4

contributed to the bad result.

5

MR. STEWART:

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The question is, for

I think ­­
Or ­­ or not

7

significantly contributed in ­­ in ­­ contributed in

8

varying degrees.

9

MR. STEWART:

I would say if ­­ if you cause

10

death by alternative means, then both people would have

11

contributed as significantly.

12

out a hypothetical that involves contribution to a bad

13

result, if you had a basketball team that lost a game by

14

one point, and the coach was asked to pinpoint the plays

15

that contributed significantly to the defeat, the coach

16

would be much more likely to identify a missed layup or

17

a turnover than the missed half­court shot at the

18

buzzer.

19

But to include ­­ to set

It's true that the missed half­court shot at

20

the buzzer would, in one sense, contribute

21

significantly, in that it was a but­for cause.

22

shot had been made, the outcome was ­­ would have been

23

different.

If the

24

But if you're talking about significant

25

contributions to a bad result, you'd more likely to

10
Alderson Reporting Company

1

focus on errors that could or ­­ and should have been

2

avoided, not simply the failure to accomplish something

3

that's extraordinarily difficult.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Can I ask a question?
Is part your ­­ your

6

answer to Justice Kagan's question and Justice Scalia's

7

question that it depends on the time point, at the time

8

at which you measure?

9

look at a State which, for 5 years, has been trying to

That is to say, if you take a

10

ameliorate pollution, you can measure it from the point

11

5 years ago; and if you do that, then they're not having

12

to contribute more.

13

MR. STEWART:

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15
16

I ­­
Or don't you like that

answer?
MR. STEWART:

I don't ­­ I don't quite want

17

to go there.

18

there ­­ in that, but that the point at which the

19

State's significant ­­ the point at which the State's

20

good neighbor obligation is triggered is by the

21

promulgation of a new National Air ­­ Ambient Air

22

Quality standard.

23

I think there's a kernel of truth in

And the State is required, within 3 years of

24

25

plan that includes good neighbor provisions for ­­ for

the particular ­­

2
3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

How far back ­­ how far

back do you go for the relevant NAAQ?

4

MR. STEWART:

2006 or ­­

In this case, there are two

5

NAAQS that were implemented ­­ that were promulgated in

6

1997.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MR. STEWART:

9

Oh, '97.
One of them for annual

particulate matter and one of them for ozone; and then

10

the 2006 NAAQS was for 24­hour particular matter ­­

11

particulate matter, which is harder to achieve.

12

And ­­ and so when ­­ when we are asking

13

what are the States supposed to do, as of the time that

14

the new NAAQS is promulgated, the States don't exactly

15

get credit for what they have done in the past; that is,

16

they can't do less than they are supposed to do in the

17

future, simply because they have done a lot in prior

18

years to prevent pollution.

19

But the fact that sources within the State

20

have, in the past, installed various pollution control

21

devices or are using cleaner fuels, that may make it

22

easier for them to prevent significant contributions to

23

downwind nonattainment, going forward.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Can I ask a question?

Following up on Justice Scalia about the statutory

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

language and how you read it, I think ­­ you know, most

2

people, everybody, thinks that it's better to regulate

3

with attention to costs than to regulate without

4

attention to costs.

5

We have this ­­ our Trucking Association

6

decision, where we said, well, notwithstanding that

7

everybody agrees that regulating with attention to costs

8

is better, when Congress says the opposite, we have to

9

go with the opposite.

And, there, we said Congress had

10

said the opposite because it had talked about protecting

11

the public health with an adequate margin of safety.

12

Now, I'm wondering, what does it take in a

13

statute to make us say, look, Congress has demanded that

14

the regulation here occur without any attention to

15

costs?

16

demanded that the regulation has occurred in a

17

fundamentally silly way.

18

MR. STEWART:

In other words, essentially, Congress has

Well, I mean in the case of the

19

NAAQS, I think it was ­­ it was not the case that

20

requiring EPA to establish the NAAQS without reference

21

to cause ­­ to cost, would cause a silly result; that is,

22

the Ambient Air Quality Standards were supposed to be

23

set based on public health criteria.

24
25

And the Court in ­­ in the same case, in
American Trucking, said that, of course, you can

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

consider costs in deciding what is the most efficient

2

and appropriate way to implement those NAAQS.

3

here, I take your point that, in order to conclude that

4

Congress barred consideration of costs at the

5

implementation stage, we would have to have very clear

6

language, and "significant contribution" doesn't do it.

7

And the other thing I would say, in addition

8

to the examples I've given of ­­ in common parlance, we

9

use "significance" to refer to ease or difficulty of

And,

10

achievement.

11

provision of law, and it's designed to help allocate the

12

responsibility among different actors for alleviating a

13

shared problem.

It's worth emphasizing that this is a

14

And, for example, suppose ­­

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The problem is that that

16

allocation among different actors is done State by

17

State, and simply taking costs into account as

18

determining who will do what simply eliminates the ­­

19

the requirement that each State not be ­­ not be

20

required to do more than its share of the pollution

21

it's ­­ it's causing downstream.

22

It's the State­by­State requirement that

23

makes it very difficult to think that all Congress

24

wanted was the most efficient reduction of pollution, no

25

matter where that pollution came from.

14
Alderson Reporting Company

That's simply

Official

1

not what the statute envisions.

2

MR. STEWART:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4
5

better statute.

I guess ­­
And maybe that'd be a

Maybe it shouldn't be State by State.

MR. STEWART:

I mean, the first thing I

6

would say is we ­­ we can accept the premise that each

7

State should alleviate no more than its share, and there

8

still may be ­­ that each State should do no more than

9

its share, and yet, there still may be different ways of

10

determining what a State's fair share is; that is, one

11

way would be to determine which States had been the

12

greatest polluters in the past and say that, the more

13

pollution that had previously flowed from your borders,

14

the greater your reduction obligation in the future.

15

But another way would be to say, in order to

16

ensure that each of the States that have shared

17

responsibility for the problem in the past bears its

18

fair share, we will ask each State to undertake

19

commensurate efforts, as measured by the cost threshold.

20

For example, if it could be shown, somehow,

21

that the generation of electric power inherently

22

required the emission of some level of SO2 and NOx, that

23

there was simply no way to ­­ to generate electricity

24

through any technology known today, without

25

generating ­­ without emitting that minimum amount, I

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

think we would certainly say, well, Congress didn't

2

intend to bury in the good neighbor provision some

3

prohibition against particular States generating

4

electricity.

5

And EPA could ­­ EPA or the States could

6

reasonably determine that the unavoidable component of

7

the emissions, the part that couldn't be avoided, even

8

with the best possible pollution control technology,

9

that would be regarded as legally insignificant; that

10

the only legally significant contribution would be

11

contribution that could have been avoided.

12

Now, clearly, EPA has gone one step farther

13

because it hasn't just focused on emissions that

14

couldn't be avoided at all, at least with ­­ without

15

foregoing the generation of electric power.

16

said, we will treat as legally significant only the

17

extra increment of emissions that comes after we've

18

taken what we regard to be equitable and cost­effective

19

pollution control ­­

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It has

Just one more question on

21

cost.

22

there is at least a possible argument that you, the

23

regulator, the government, the EPA, can take cost into

24

account, unless it's expressly prohibited from doing so.

25

You don't go that far.

In ­­ in your answer to Justice Kagan's question,

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

But you ­­ you even stop short of that.

2

say that it might be difficult to apply the cost

3

rationale at the implementation stage?

4

that's what you said, and if so, I didn't quite

5

understand.

6

MR. STEWART:

I misspoke.

You

I ­­ I think

What the Court

7

said in American Trucking is that in ­­ in setting the

8

NAAQS, EPA was forbidden to consider cost, not because

9

the statute said, in so many words, cost can't be

10

considered, but because the criteria that were set out

11

in the statute for what the NAAQS had to achieve simply

12

couldn't be reconciled with consideration of costs.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

MR. STEWART:

I understand.
But the Court in the same decision said,

15

although you can't consider costs in determining what

16

the NAAQS will be ­­ what air quality standards have to

17

be achieved, of course, you can and should consider

18

costs in deciding what implementation measures should be

19

used to determine which emissions will be reduced.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If Congress wanted that,

21

why couldn't Congress simply have said, the EPA shall

22

prescribe minimum pollution reduction measures that have

23

to be taken by the States?

24

statute from what we have before us.

25

saying is ­­ you know, you ­­ you reduce it this ­­ this

26

much, as much as efficiency will allow, or else, you're

That's a quite different
But what you're

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

in violation of ­­ of the good neighbor rule.
And that's a very different statute from

3

what Congress wrote.

4

ought to control all ­­ all efficiency measures for

5

reducing pollution, but it's certainly not the statute

6

that Congress wrote.

7

MR. STEWART:

Maybe it's a good idea.

Maybe EPA

Let me say three things in

8

response to that.

9

before, the good neighbor provision is addressed in the

10

first instance to the States; that is, it's the State's

11

initial obligation to submit an implementation plan that

12

contains good neighbor provisions.

13

The first is that, as I mentioned

And so if the Court says costs can't be

14

considered in defining significant contribution, the

15

effect is not simply that EPA can't consider that factor

16

when it steps into the State's shoes.

17

that a State can't consider cost of achievement

18

in attempting, in good faith, to implement its own good

19

neighbor provision.

20

The second thing I would say ­­

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22
23

understand that.
MR. STEWART:

The effect is

Excuse me.

I don't

Please say that again.
The good neighbor provision ­­

24

we're dealing here with a situation where EPA was the

25

one that promulgated Federal implementation plans, but

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that's only because the States didn't ­­ the relevant

2

upwind States did not discharge their obligation to

3

implement State ­­ promulgate State implementation plans

4

that contain good neighbor provisions.

5

But the language "contribute significantly"

6

is in the portion of the statute that deals with what a

7

State plan is supposed to contain.

8

with ­­ it's not in a provision that, by its terms, is

9

addressed directly to EPA.

10

It's not dealing

And so if the Court said, in defining

11

"contribute significantly," we can't take into account

12

the cost of emission control measures, that would mean

13

not simply that EPA can't consider that factor when it

14

steps into the State's shoes; it would also mean that

15

the State can't consider that factor.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Stewart ­­
Well, when you

18

mention the fact that the States didn't address the good

19

neighbor requirement ­­ of course, you hadn't come up

20

with their budgets that they had to meet at the time

21

that they had to promulgate their SIPs.

22

Now, at a different point in your brief, you

23

emphasize how incredibly complicated it is for States to

24

determine how much they must reduce their emissions to

25

take care of the fact that they significantly

19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

contributed to downwind pollution.

2

And yet, you would impose on those States

3

the burden to issue the good neighbor program without

4

knowing how much you expect them to ­­ to meet.

5

MR. STEWART:

Well, it's the statute that

6

imposes the obligation on the States.

7

to draw the Court's attention to the relevant

8

provisions.

9

government's opening brief, the relevant provision is 42

10
11

And it may help

On page 1a of the appendix to the

USC 7410.
And 7410(a)(1) begins by saying, "Each State

12

shall, after reasonable notice and public hearings,

13

adopt and submit to the administrator of EPA within 3

14

years or such shorter period as the administrator may

15

prescribe after the promulgation of a national primary

16

ambient air quality standard, the NAAQS."

17

goes on to say, "A plan which provides for

18

implementation," and so forth.

19

And then it

And then, if you look to the bottom of ­­ or

20

to the top of page 2a ­­ I'm sorry ­­ subsection (2)

21

begins, "Each implementation plan submitted by a State

22

under this chapter shall be adopted by the State after

23

reasonable notice and public hearing.

24

shall," and then if you look at the bottom of the page,

25

it says, "contain adequate provisions prohibiting,

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So ­­ so if you were

6

working for one of the upwind States and you were facing

7

this 3­year deadline and EPA had not told anyone how it

8

intended to interpret the State's obligations under the

9

good neighbor policy, what would you have told the State

10

to do?

11

MR. STEWART:

Well, certainly, EPA's basic

12

methodology of using ­­ using cost thresholds had been

13

embodied in the ­­ the NAAQS SIP call in 1998, and in

14

CAIR, which I believe was promulgated in 2006.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

So ­­ but

16

the head of the State EPA comes to you and says, how

17

much do we have to reduce our emissions to satisfy our

18

requirements?

19

And you would tell them what?

MR. STEWART:

We would tell them, in all

20

honesty, we don't know yet.

21

fatal flaw in the argument; that is, it is inherent in

22

any legal context in which one person acts and then a

23

second person reviews, that the first person has to act

24

before the second person has ­­ has made up his or her

25

mind.

But that ­­ that's not a

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And so a district court ­­

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but that kind

3

of glosses over the fact that, as you say elsewhere in

4

your brief, this is a ­­ is your analogy, right ­­ a

5

spaghetti matrix or something?

6

possible way for the State to know how much of a burden

7

you expect them to address, and yet, you're saying,

8

well, you've got to do it, and you've got to do it

9

within 3 years, or we're going to take over the

10
11

And so there's no

responsibility.
MR. STEWART:

Well, certainly, what EPA was

12

called upon to do was far more complicated than what any

13

particular State was going to be called upon to do

14

because, as a result of widespread noncompliance, EPA

15

was promulgating Federal implementation plans for close

16

to 30 States and plans for ­­ for different NAAQS.

17

The second thing I would say is that ­­

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But could I address

19

the first thing first?

20

think EPA has an easier job dealing with it as a group.

21

They say, look, here are these States, here's what you

22

have to do.

23

its particular role is going to be in your group

24

resolution.

25

I'm not sure that's right.

I

But any individual State has no idea what

MR. STEWART:

Well, it certainly has the

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

data available to it that ­­ that EPA had available

2

about how much did each State contribute to the overage

3

at various nonattainer ­­ nonattainment receptors in the

4

past.

5

It's certainly true that the States wouldn't

6

necessarily know exactly what policy judgment EPA would

7

ultimately make as to what the right cost threshold was.

8

But ­­

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, but that's crucial.

I

10

mean, it would have no idea whether EPA would use any or

11

would pick $500 or would pick whatever.

12

know how it could sensibly design a ­­ a program without

13

knowing that.

14

MR. STEWART:

I mean, I don't

I guess the second ­­ the

15

other two points I would make are, first, the State's

16

role is to devise something, in this area, as in others,

17

that it believes will carry out its own legal

18

obligations, not necessarily to predict just how EPA

19

would do it if the task fell to EPA.

20

And so, for example, when the States are

21

undertaking a more ­­ the more prosaic task of devising

22

plans that will produce attainment of the NAAQS within

23

their own borders, they have to make a variety of policy

24

judgments about the right mix of emission controls, what

25

sources should be allowed to emit, in ­­ in what

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

amounts.
If a particular State just didn't do it,

3

that task would fall to EPA.

4

that anything the particular State would come up with

5

would exactly match what EPA would ultimately devise.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And it's very unlikely

Can you give us an example

7

of when EPA has done this in the past, where a ­­ a

8

crucial element of a ­­ of a NAAQS has not been defined

9

by the agency, and yet, the agency, nonetheless,

10

requires the States to ­­ to put together their SIPs

11

without knowing what their target is?

12

And that's the problem here.

What's your

13

best example of another case in which the agency said,

14

you ­­ you put together a SIP, and we're not going to

15

tell you what the target is.

16

MR. STEWART:

Well, the examples I would

17

point to are in the brief filed by the ­­ the Respondent

18

States that are on our side of the case, who identify

19

examples of instances where States did successfully

20

comply with their good neighbor obligations and ­­ and

21

persuaded EPA that what they had done was enough.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that just means it's

23

pin the tail on the donkey.

Some States got the tail.

24

I mean ­­ you know, they pinned it in the right place.

25

That doesn't prove anything.

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I want an example of another instance in

2

which EPA has ­­ has hidden the ball, has said, we're

3

not going to tell you what the target is, it's up to you

4

to come up ­­ up with a SIP, and we'll tell you after

5

the fact whether that SIP happened to meet the target

6

that we've invented.

7

MR. STEWART:

I don't ­­ I wouldn't

8

characterize what EPA is doing as hiding the ball; that

9

is, it didn't kind of fail to divulge information that

10

it had its ­­ at its disposal.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

MR. STEWART:

All right.

All right.

It released a great deal of

13

information at the time that the proposed rule was

14

announced in the ­­ the summer of 2010.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

MR. STEWART:

Okay.
But ­­ but I take your point

17

that ­­ the two additional things I would say, though,

18

are that, for better or worse, Congress did place this

19

obligation of the States.

20

least in the mine run of ­­ of cases, States were

21

capable of carrying out this task.

22

It evidently thought that, at

And at least to the extent that adopting a

23

good ­­ a good neighbor provision requires consideration

24

of circumstances in other States, in a sense, this is

25

just the flip side of what the downwind States have to

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

do all the time; that is, if New York officials are

2

trying to determine, when a new NAAQS comes out, how can

3

we bring our own air quality into compliance?

4

controls do we have to place on our own sources, in

5

order to get air quality to the desired level?

What

The New York officials have to take account

7

of the degree of pollution that is likely to travel to

emissions within their own borders in a vacuum.

They can't analyze

11

neighbors ­­

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

That just means

13

there's some facts that they don't know.

14

there are always going to be uncertainty about certain

15

facts.

16

not just about the facts.

17

we're expected to hit.

18

Of course,

But here, there is uncertainty about the target,

MR. STEWART:

We don't know what target

I guess the final thing I

19

would say on ­­ on this part of the ­­ this particular

20

sub­issue of the case is that, even if you reach that

21

conclusion, even if you determine that it was just

22

practically infeasible for any State to adopt a

23

compliant State implementation plan with good neighbor

24

provisions for these NAAQS until EPA acted, then the

25

proposition of the opposing States still wouldn't

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

follow; that is, the statute in the provisions that I've

2

pointed to says it's up to the States in the first

3

instance to devise the State implementation plans,

4

including good neighbor provisions.

5

And then, on page 10a of the same

6

provision ­­ of the same appendix, I'm sorry ­­ the

7

statute describes what happens if a State fails to

8

satisfy that obligation.

9

And this is at the beginning of subsection

10

(c)(1) on page 10A, it says, "The Administrator shall

11

promulgate a Federal implementation plan at any time

12

within 2 years after the Administrator finds that a

13

State has failed to make a required submission or finds

14

that the plan or plan revision submitted by the State

15

does not satisfy the minimum criteria."

16

And ­­

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Stewart, below, the

18

government conceded that there was a theoretical

19

possibility that some States could be overcontrolled,

20

that they would be implementing measures that would

21

reduce their contributions to pollution below the one

22

percent.

23

possibility of that ­­ but that your approach was

24

basically fine.

25

Assume that ­­ I think there's a theoretical

What would we do about that?

27
Alderson Reporting Company

First of all,

Official

1

are there measures States can take to get out of the

2

FIP, if it's inappropriate to them, because of

3

overcontrol?

4

mean, what's the process?

5

And if not ­­ and how do they do it?

If we think there's a flaw, do we vacate the

6

rule?

7

what ­­ and what's our power to do it?

I

Do we leave it in place?

MR. STEWART:

What do we do?

And

I mean, I think, in the

circumstance you describe, if you reach the conclusion

10

that there was a theoretical possibility that this could

11

happen and that it would be a problem if it did, but

12

that the methodology used by EPA was, on the whole,

13

rational, I think the task for the Court at this stage

14

of the case is to rule on the more big picture

15

objections that are properly before it and ­­ and that

16

the court of appeals ruled on.

Now, even if we win everything that's at

variety of more specific challenges to the details of

22

23

would be an opportunity for the court below to consider

24

those.

25

There are a

And so, if we won on the issues that are

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

been done?

4

MR. STEWART:

Including ­­
Or would that have

Well, to ­­ to the extent that

5

any State had ­­ and I don't know the ­­ the pending

6

as­applied challenges at this level of detail.

7

the extent that any State has a properly preserved

8

challenge to the effect that it is actually likely to be

9

subject to overcontrol, then that could be heard by the

10
11

But to

court of appeals.
The court of appeals could determine both

12

whether that is, in fact, likely to happen and whether,

13

if it does happen, that would render the rule arbitrary

14

and capricious as to that State.

15

But the ­­ the real problem with the court

16

of appeals methodology was that it said the fact that

17

EPA can't absolutely rule out the possibility that it

18

might happen renders the rule invalid on its face, and

19

in other portions of the opinion, the court faulted EPA

20

for failing to ensure that its regime would not lead to

21

overcontrol.

22

And I think that's an extraordinary standard

23

for an administrative agency to deal with; that is ­­

24

you know, it happens all the time that Federal agencies

25

are given authority to regulate ­­ to address one

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

problem, and the regulation necessarily has spillover

2

effects on other conduct.

3

And so, for instance, if a Federal agency

4

was tasked with preventing the sale in interstate

5

commerce of contaminated food, it might require

6

inspections, it might require the recall of food after

7

one item in a shipment had been shown to be

8

contaminated.

9

effects on food that was not, in fact, contaminated.

10

But that wouldn't be a flaw in the rule.

These measures might have spillover

Of

11

course, an agency could go overboard and impose a regime

12

that was so onerous in comparison to the health benefits

13

that it was arbitrary and capricious.

14

But nobody would ever say that it's the duty

15

of the agency to ensure that there is no other means of

16

achieving the same health benefits at lower cost to the

17

public.

18

The other thing that the States could do ­­

19

I mentioned that one way in which a State that believed

20

itself to be unfairly or inappropriately treated by the

21

rule was to pursue any adequately preserved legal

22

challenge it may have in the judicial proceedings.

23

And as your question indicated, there is

24

also a mechanism by which a State can ask to have the

25

Federal implementation plan replaced by a plan of its

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

own devising.
And so the consequence of the State's

3

failure to achieve their good neighbor obligations in

4

time and EPA's stepping into their shoes, that ­­ the

5

consequence was not that they're forever barred from

6

devising their own plans.

7

that the Federal implementation plan would remain in

8

effect for a fairly limited period of time, subject to

9

replacement by a State plan.

10

The consequence was simply

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If we were to rule

11

against you and affirm the decision below, how long do

12

you think it would take to get a new rule in place?

13

MR. STEWART:

I don't have an estimate on

14

the time, but if the Court affirms on the ground that

15

EPA may not consider costs ­­ part of the problem ­­ I

16

think it would be an extraordinary undertaking for EPA

17

to try to achieve; that is, part of the difficulty here

18

is that nobody has identified a concrete alternative;

19

that is, a plan that would not consider costs and

20

that ­­ yet that would disperse the burdens of

21

compliance among the States in proportion to their prior

22

contributions and also would address the nonattainment

23

problem at all of the downwind receptors.

24

I don't know if it could be ­­

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could you explain that to

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

me, Mr. Stewart?

2

straight proportionality approach that was applied in

3

the D.C. Circuit, are you saying that that's impossible?

4

Or are you saying it's complicated and dumb?

5

Because are you saying that the

MR. STEWART:

What ­­ at least what we

6

understand to be the straight proportionality approach

7

is impossible; that is, it might be possible with

8

respect to any particular downwind receptor because you

9

could say that, if one upwind State is contributing two

10

units and another four and another seven, the

11

proportional solution might be to require that any

12

necessary reduction would be in those proportions.

13

One State would do 2/13ths of the reduction,

14

another would do 4/13ths of the reduction, and another

15

would do 7/13ths of the reduction.

16

theoretically possible, with respect to any receptor.

17

But with respect to another receptor, the same States

18

might be contributing in entirely different proportions,

19

and so there would be no way of devising a solution that

20

would be proportionate as to both.

That's sort of arbitrary.

MR. STEWART:

Well, I mean, the purpose of

5

the cost threshold was not to increase or decrease the

6

total amount of reductions that would be necessary.

7

would be to ensure that the reductions that had to take

8

place were done in the most cost­effective manner

9

possible.

10

It

And part of the irony ­­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I understand that, but my

11

point is that is certainly a pretty ­­ pretty arbitrary

12

number, and ­­ and I think averaging for all the

13

receptors is certainly no more arbitrary.

14

MR. STEWART:

Well, I think the cost

15

methodology is one that EPA had used often in the past.

16

Indeed, even before the term "contribute significantly"

17

was added to the statute in 1990, EPA had interpreted

18

the prior reading of the statute to allow relief for a

19

downwind State, if an upwind State was contributing

20

significantly to downwind pollution, and it had

21

interpreted that standard as allowing consideration of

22

cost and compliance burdens.

23

I mean, one of the ironic things about this

24

case is that the only ill consequence of overcontrol is

25

cost; that is, this is not a situation in which there is

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

some distinct public health benefit ­­ distinct public

2

health problem ­­ I'm sorry ­­ that is caused if power

3

plants are emitting too little NOx or SO2.

4

reason that people worry about overcontrol, about

5

reducing emissions more than they need to be, is that it

6

costs money.

7

The only

And if that's the problem to be avoided, it

8

seems strange that EPA can't take account of costs in

9

devising a solution.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Sir, I don't want you to ­­

11

finish your argument, if you had something to say on

12

what you started out with in describing the plan.

13

said there are three aspects.

14

cut out anyone ­­ any State that's contributing less

15

than one percent.

You

The first aspect was you

16

You said the second aspect was that you used

17

a metric of $500 per ton of NOx reduced, and you applied

18

that to the States still in, and then you said there

19

were three, and you never got to three, and I want to be

20

sure you do, if you had that.

21

MR. STEWART:

The third part of the process

22

is that, once each State's emissions budget has been

23

quantified, with respect to each State, the EPA

24

essentially divides up the emissions that are allowed

25

among the different power plants within the State's

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

borders.

2

allowances to the various power plants that add up to

3

the total number of tons of pollutants that are allowed

4

to be emitted.

5

And the way that it does that is it gives

And it's important to emphasize that the

6

States have not joined the industry's argument here that

7

cost ­­ even the States on the other side of the case

8

have not joined the industry's argument here that

9

states ­­ that costs can't be considered.

10

Those States are not quarreling with the

11

methodology by which EPA quantified their State emission

12

budgets.

13

those had been quantified, they should have been given

14

an opportunity to determine, on their own, how the

15

allowances should be allocated without EPA doing it

16

first.

Those States are simply saying that, once

17

In some situations, that might have been a

18

rational way for EPA to proceed; that is, the statute

19

says that once the ­­ once EPA finds that a particular

20

State has either failed to submit a good neighbor SIP or

21

has ­­ or EPA has disapproved the good neighbor SIP,

22

once that happens, the statute says that EPA, at any

23

time within 2 years, can promulgate its own Federal

24

implementation plan.

25

And in some circumstances, it might be

35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

rational for EPA to wait the full 2 years and give

2

additional guidance to States, in order to give them

3

every opportunity to devise compliant plans.

4

were basically two reasons that EPA didn't do that here.

5

The first is that it was subject to the D.C. Circuit's

6

mandate in North Carolina, which said get something in

7

place that works as soon as possible, and EPA felt

8

constrained by that to act as quickly as it could.

9

And the second point worth emphasizing is

10

that there are State sovereign interests on both sides

11

of the case.

12

plan, in the first instance, EPA has intruded to a

13

degree on the ability of the upwind States to decide how

14

emissions allowances should be allocated among their own

15

sources.

16

It's true that, by devising a Federal

But the downwind States are subject to their

17

own obligations to comply with the NAAQS within their

18

own borders, and to the extent that they can't get

19

relief from the upwind States, their task is made more

20

difficult.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm sure I should know this

22

after reading all these briefs, but if we ­­ if we

23

reverse the D.C. Circuit, what would happen, going

24

forward?

25

found not to comply, so the EPA does its FIP.

2

But that's not the end of the game, is it?

3

I mean, isn't the EPA under a continuing obligation to

4

look at, review its NAAQS, to give the States further

5

opportunities to come back?

6

MR. STEWART:

Yes.

I mean, with respect to

7

the particular NAAQS that are at issue here, the

8

States ­­ it's unclear to what extent they've been

9

working on this in the interim, but the States certainly

10

could, even under the terms of the transport rule,

11

propose State implementation plans to replace the FIPs.

12

Now, it's to be contemplated that there will

13

be additional NAAQS implemented, and this Court's

14

decision would affect the way in which both the States

15

and EPA went about the business of determining how good

16

neighbor obligations should be carried out with respect

17

to those future NAAQS.

ON BEHALF OF THE STATE AND LOCAL RESPONDENTS
MR. MITCHELL:

6

EPA's approach requires the States to submit

7

SIPs that can only guess at how EPA will quantify their

8

good neighbor obligations under Section 7410(a)(2)(D).

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it's ­­ it's

10

certainly ­­ it's certainly hard, but it is what the

11

statute says; and it seems to me that, if EPA had taken

12

a different view, it would have been contrary to the

13

statute.

14

MR. MITCHELL:

EPA's actions are unlawful

15

for several independent reasons.

16

actions in this case represent an arbitrary and

17

capricious change in the way that the Agency has

18

interpreted the statute.

The first is EPA's

19

For 15 years, starting with the NAAQS SIP

20

call in 1998, EPA told the States not to submit good

21

neighbor State ­­ good neighbor SIPs before EPA had

22

quantified the State's obligations under (a)(2)(D).

23

EPA repeated that stance numerous times, including in

24

the disapproval of Nevada’s SIP that we cite on Pages 9

25

and 59 of our brief, and also in the sources that the D.C.

38
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

Circuit cites on pages 51, 52, and 56 of the Petition

2

Appendix.

3

EPA has now done a 180­degree shift, and

4

they have told the States that they are required to

5

submit good neighbor State ­­ SIPs before EPA has

6

quantified their obligations under Subsection (a)(2)(D).

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

exactly how to do it.

9

So it sounds as if what you're making is a procedural

15

our opinion; and so, now, we go to the Federal process,

17

then, if you feel that their thing is no good, propose

18

your own solutions again.

19

That's what he's saying.

But it's supposed to advance the ball.

So

20

there is a procedure for the States to come in, if they

21

can come up with a better plan, that's what you've just

22

heard, and so do it.

6

way, they'll say, well, what's unreasonable about

8

changing our way?

We're trying to get the job done.

MR. MITCHELL:

EPA is allowed to change

10

their interpretation of the statute, but if they're

11

going to do that, they have to acknowledge, in the

12

transport rule, that they're abandoning the prior

13

construction of the statute ­­

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, years and years, the

15

neighbor board ­­ the labor board decided things in

16

adjudications, rules.

17

we should preside rulemaking processes, like other

18

agencies.

Does anything in the law prevent that?

No, they're not prevented

MR. MITCHELL:

We're still waiting

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But at least if you've

7

adopted a SIP or proposed a SIP, you've given reasons,

8

you have a ­­ you have a rational plan, and the EPA then

9

must give a reasoned response to it; whereas, if the EPA

10

is the first one, they're writing on a blank slate; and

11

it seems to me that, in some respects, the EPA is more

12

constrained under this process to which you object.

13

MR. MITCHELL:

Well, it's still an unlawful

14

use of the FIP authority for several reasons ­­ and this

15

gets back to Justice Breyer's question, why is this

16

unlawful?

17

And there are several reasons.

The first is that EPA has changed its

18

interpretation of the statute, and the key language from

19

the NAAQS SIP call appears on Pages 57,368 through 370,

20

where EPA tells the States, we don't want you to submit

21

good neighbor SIPs that simply take a guess at what you

22

think the good neighbor obligations are, we will

23

quantify your obligations in a rule first and then ­­

5

point?

6

MR. MITCHELL:

Is that your

Not only that, they said, in

7

the NAAQS SIP calls, that they are adopting an

8

interpretation of the statute that prohibits us from

9

doing that, that the interpretation of the statute that

10

EPA adopted is that EPA, and only EPA, is the

11

institution that is charged with the responsibility of

12

quantifying a State's good neighbor obligations.

13

The States had argued for a different

14

approach back in 1998.

15

prerogative to decide what the good neighbor obligations

16

mean; and EPA said, no, we are the sole entity with that

17

prerogative, and you need to wait until we issue a rule

18

that quantifies your obligations.

19

We wanted to have the

EPA has now changed that approach without

20

explaining or acknowledging in the transport rule that

21

they were abandoning their earlier interpretation of the

22

statute.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But they were doing that

24

with respect to the NAAQS.

25

saying they had to quantify the NAAQS.

I thought that was them

44
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. MITCHELL:

What they said on a NAAQS SIP

2

call was they have to quantify the good neighbor

3

obligations.

4

to contribute significantly to another State's air

5

pollution.

6

They have to tell the States what it means

And that leads to a second statutory problem

7

with this regime in the transport rule.

8

the prerogative, under the Clean Air Act, to do what the

9

Federal minimum requirements are for clean air and to go

10
11

The States have

no further.
EPA's approach here requires the States,

12

when they submit or propose SIPs, and they have to take

13

a wild guess as to what their good neighbor obligations

14

are, it effectively compels the States to overcontrol

15

and overregulate because, if they want EPA to approve

16

the SIP and they don't know what their good neighbor

17

obligations will be, they have to overshoot and

18

overcontrol and overregulate or risk that EPA will deny

19

their SIP and impose a FIP on the State.

20

And what EPA is essentially doing is telling

21

the States that, if you want to do only what the Federal

22

floor requires and to go no further, the price of that

23

is that you have to accept an EPA­imposed FIP that

24

defines those obligations, rather than giving the State

25

the opportunity to distribute regulatory burdens in a

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Mitchell, I might just

3

not be understanding you, but this goes back to the

4

Chief Justice's question.

5

these standards are originally promulgated, the State

gets 3 years to make its best pitch, and then the

7

administrator shall promulgate a FIP at any time within

8

two years after that.

9

The statute says, look, after

Now, presumably, there are lots of

10

conversations that can happen between the EPA and the

11

States during those 5 years, and maybe, sometimes, more

12

of those conversations happen and, sometimes, less of

13

those conversations happen.

14

different constructions of the statute.

15

But I don't see that as

It seems to me, as the statute sets up its

16

framework, you go first, do it within 3 years; then the

17

EPA goes, it has to do it within 2 years.

18

has very substantial discretion under this statute as to

19

what kinds of conversations it wants to have when,

20

within that broad structure.

21

Why am I not reading it right?

22

MR. MITCHELL:

The EPA just

EPA had no authority to impose Federal implementation

I don't think the Court

5

should wait because the issues that we're raising are

6

discrete from what's being challenged by those three

States in their separate proceedings.

8

we're making are that, first, EPA has no authority to

impose a FIP on the States before quantifying the good

neighbor obligations under (a)(2)(D); and, second, EPA

11

improperly invoked the corrections ­­

We're not relying solely on

17

the statute, Justice Ginsburg, that's correct.

18

argument is that EPA has changed its interpretation of

20

rule, without adequately acknowledging or explaining how

21

its new interpretation is consistent with the statute.

22

Our

But we're also relying on the statute as

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER KEISLER

It

ON BEHALF OF THE INDUSTRY AND LABOR RESPONDENTS
MR. KEISLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The private party Respondents are focused on

24

the statutory limitations to the EPA's authority under

25

the good neighbor provision.

And I'd like to begin by

56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

addressing the issue that my friend from the government

2

focused on a lot, which is the use of cost, and to

3

explain not only what we think the statute requires in

4

this regard, but why, Justice Kagan, it would be neither

5

silly nor dumb; or, Justice Sotomayor, crazy to read the

6

statute the way we suggest.

7

And we begin with the text of the statute,

8

which authorizes the prohibition only of amounts that

9

contribute significantly to nonattainment or interfere

10

with maintenance in downwind locations.

11

that language, we think, is quite clearly on the effects

12

of a State's emissions on other States and not on the

13

cost of reducing them.

14

The focus of

What EPA has done here is assert that it has

15

the power to increase a State's reduction obligations

16

beyond what a focus on the effects of its emissions

17

would require, simply because EPA has decided that it

18

would be reasonably affordable for that State to bear a

19

higher burden.

20

And what that means is that States here

21

which are making only a very slight contribution to air

22

quality problems in downwind States are nonetheless

23

required to make very substantial reductions, in many

24

cases, far more than States that are making far greater

25

contributions to poor air quality in the same downwind

57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

2

locations.
There is no relationship at all, under the

3

EPA's methodology, between the amount a State

4

contributes and the amount it has to reduce because the

5

entire driver is cost.

6

one component.

7

entire driver ­­

Mr. Stewart said that cost was

It's not one component.

JUSTICE BREYER:

It is the

Why is it wrong?

That is,

I focused on your argument here in the briefs, which is

10

very clear and very good.

11

comes to my mind is we have an overgrazing problem in

12

State A.

13

And ­­ and the example that

All right?

It's caused because cows come in from State

14

B and sheep come in from State C.

15

sheep men are in different States.

16

(Laughter.)

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

The cow men and the
They're not friends.

Now, it turns out ­­ it

18

turns out that EPA, which is in charge of preventing the

19

overgrazing, discovers that, if the sheep men build a

20

fence, that will cure the problem, even though they only

21

contribute half or maybe less.

22

Well, if we bury it ­­ you know, we divide

23

it equally, you each have to pay ­­ you each have to

24

cause half the problem because that seems fair, it's

25

going to end up that the people in State A with the

58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

cows, they're going to starve to death.
So our choice is between taking two people,

3

two States, each of whom cause half the problem and

4

getting an overall plan where you solve the problem at

5

minimal cost or just dividing it 50/50, which seems fair

6

in mathematics, but leads to starvation, cost and death,

7

et cetera.

8
9

Do you see what I'm driving at?

And that's what they've done here, the
second method.

They ­­ rather the ­­ they're not

10

treating each State alike, you are right.

11

reason that they're not treating each State alike is

12

they know, one, all the States are partly responsible in

13

more than one percent, and with this plan, we get the

14

job done at much lower cost.

15
16
17

And the

Now, where in the statute does it say they
can't do that?
MR. KEISLER:

I'll try to respond to that ­­

18

that fully, Justice Breyer.

19

and we would acknowledge that there are always going to

20

be legitimate policy arguments in favor of the least

21

cost, most efficient solution to any problem.

22

Certainly, it is the case

But we would also say that there are

23

countervailing policy arguments at issue here, and we do

24

believe the statute sides with those countervailing

25

policy arguments.

And the countervailing policy

59
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

arguments here are focused on the fact that, in Your

2

Honor's hypothetical, where there's one State that it

3

would cost more to reduce and another State it would

4

cost less.

5

The only scenario in which you get a

6

different result under the EPA's approach and our

7

approach is where the State that would cost more to

8

reduce is, in fact, contributing a lot more to the

9

downwind State's air problem than the other State.

10

And for several reasons, we think when the

11

statute looks at that issue and asks the question of

12

whether EPA should have the authority to force the State

13

which is, in fact, contributing less to nonetheless

14

reduce more simply because it's costly, we think there

15

are at least three reasons why the statute embodies the

16

policy choice that says, no, the State that contributes

17

more, reduces more; the State that contributes less,

18

reduce less.

19

The first is the one that I mentioned at the

20

outset, which is the statutory text, which we think

21

quite clearly is focused on the effects.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, yes.

significantly.

6

MR. KEISLER:

No, that's right.

And I don't

7

think the word "significantly" can bear the weight that

8

Mr. Stewart places on it.

9

"contribute to nonattainment."

It modifies the words
So it's about the degree

10

of causal contribution.

11

the phrase "interference with maintenance," and they've

12

used the same cost methodology to implement that as

13

well.

And it doesn't modify, at all,

14

But the second, beyond the text, the whole

15

structure of the Clean Air Act is focused on treating

16

the States as separate entities, which are responsible

17

for the emissions that happen within their borders and

18

the effect that those emissions have on other States.

19

That's why this is in a SIP, rather than some general

20

EPA regulation, and that's why the language of the

21

statute is what it is, amounts of emissions within a

22

State.

23

And in this regard, I think it's ­­it's

24

telling that, in the reply brief, what the government

25

said was that it believes it has the kind of authority

61
Alderson Reporting Company

here to consider cost that would be considered by a

2

chancellor at equity in a nuisance case.

The EPA has before it separate States, with

talking about.

And ­­ and keep that in mind because I

Now, my point is, did you find in

22

Congress ­­ and I'm interested in legislative history ­­

23

did you find anything in the legislative history that

24

suggests that, where the EPA faces this kind of regional

25

problem, and it's a regional, not just a statewide

62
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

problem, that people in Congress thought they had an

2

answer or a glimmer of an answer, as opposed to taking

3

this language, which is pretty open, and saying, we're

4

going to leave it to ­­ we don't know, we don't have a

5

clue.

6

we're giving them a broad authority here.

7

The EPA is there to figure this thing out, and

Is there anything that cuts on your side

8

that you see, as opposed to the other side of reading

9

this language?

10

MR. KEISLER:

I think there's one thing I

11

can cite, Your Honor, and that is that the statutory

12

history in this case is that the predecessor version to

13

what we currently have before us simply said that States

14

were required to prohibit the amounts which prevent

15

attainment or maintenance, no word "significantly," just

16

prevent attainment or maintenance.

17

looking at that language, there's nothing in there that

18

would suggest that costs can be taken into account.

19

I think, certainly,

What Congress said in the committee report

20

in 1990, when it added the words "significantly

21

contribute to nonattainment and interfere with

22

maintenance," was that it was doing that precisely

23

because it recognized that this was a provision that

24

addressed causation of bad air quality effects because

25

what it was doing was not introducing some new element

63
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of cost, but relaxing the causation standard, saying it

2

shouldn't be something like but­for causation, where the

3

question is just does it prevent attainment or maintenance.

4

It's enough if it contributes significantly to

5

nonattainment or interfere.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, Mr. Keisler, I mean, you

7

have a statute here that clearly does not have any

8

language about no costs allowed, that also does not have

9

what the American Trucking Association statute had,

10

which was like public health only, sufficient margin of

11

safety; right?

12

exactly what you said.

13

on causal contribution, right?

14

So none of that.

What you have is

You have a statute that focuses

So this is a hard problem, right?

15

Because ­­ I mean, let me just sort of give you a

16

numerical example, which I'm sure is as simplistic as

17

the other numerical examples floating around this case.

18

But ­­ you know, let's say that the standard is a

19

hundred.

20

are two States, X and Y, that have each contributed 20.

21

Right.

22

And there's a State that has 120, and there

So we ­­ you know, we only need 20 of those.

23

We have 40.

And the question is how do you get from

24

those 40 to those 20?

25

well, we take 10 from each.

The D.C. Circuit would just say,
But if this ­­ if the

64
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

question is only about causal contribution and that's

2

all that the statute talks about, there have to be other

3

ways we can make that determination of what contribution

4

each should be legally responsible for, right?

5

And what the EPA said here was, we're going

6

to distinguish between ­­ we're going to distinguish

7

between States that have ­­ have put a lot of technology

8

and a lot of money into this already and, on the other

9

hand, States that have lots of cheap and dirty

10

emissions.

11

thing to do under this very statute?

12

And why isn't that a perfectly rational

MR. KEISLER:

Well, first of all, I think,

13

in the example that Your Honor gave, where you had the

14

two States and should they be each reduced to ten, the

15

reason in favor of doing it that way, from a statutory

16

perspective, is that that then gives a consistent

17

application to the same causal language in the statute,

18

which means that the same causal effect from one upwind

19

State on a downwind State isn't significant if it comes

20

from Indiana to Delaware, but insignificant if it comes

21

from Tennessee; and that, when the statute says that

22

States must prohibit the amounts they significantly

23

contribute, then the more they contribute, the more they

24

reduce.

25

So we see that as fitting much more securely

65
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

within the statutory language than the kind of shifting

2

that Your Honor mentioned.

3

imagine, since the policy rationales that are behind

4

Your Honor's question are certainly legitimate and more

5

than plausible, certainly, one could imagine a statute

6

that Congress could have written, which would have said,

7

treat it at as national playing field, ignore the fact

8

that there are State boundaries, think about what the

9

most efficient way to force reductions to achieve

Certainly, one could

10

attainment in downwind locations, locate those

11

reductions in the least cost areas, and impose those on

12

the States.

13

Surely, if that was what Congress had

14

intended, it wouldn't have written the statute which

15

directs each State to include in its SIP provisions

16

that ­­

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do you battle

Mr. Stewart's point that Congress surely didn't intend

19

to shut down these plants if they didn't or couldn't

20

feasibly reduce their contributions?

21
22
23

MR. KEISLER:

Yes, Your Honor, but we think

the statute ­­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So if they couldn't

24

feasibly do it, doesn't the words "significantly

25

contribute" have to take into account, in some way, the

66
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

cost of reducing the amount?
MR. KEISLER:

Your Honor, I'm here on behalf

3

of industry and labor, so certainly, we believe that

4

there have to be mechanisms to deal with the kinds of

5

problems that Your Honor just identified, but we don't

6

think they come out of defining the amounts that

7

significantly contribute to nonattainment.

8

that those kinds of considerations come into play

9

elsewhere in the process.

10

We think

In the American Trucking case that's been

11

referred to, the Court said that, when States are

12

implementing the requirements of the EPA, for example,

13

by deciding to allocate among different sources what

14

the ­­ how the reduction would be distributed, they can

15

take costs into account.

16

in the SIP process when that definition of what amount

17

significantly contributes is then translated into an

18

emission reduction obligation.

And there are other mechanisms

19

We do think there are occasions, and we've

20

noted them in Note 17 of our brief, where the State in

21

then formulating its SIP can say, okay, this is the

22

amount we have to reduce, but we're going to do it in

23

this way because costs have to be taken into account.

24
25

But that is a very different matter from
saying that EPA, in defining what amounts significantly

67
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

contribute, can do the same thing.

2

different ­­ the reason it's not just, oh, you know, we're

3

locating it in some different box what EPA wants to do

in its box, is that the box that we're locating it in

5

makes clear that it functions as the kind of break Your

MR. KEISLER:

Well, the trading presents

unique issues under this statute.

anywhere it's appropriate, but this is a statute which

is focused on providing relief to downwind States.

Well, I'm trying to use the

most ­­ I'm trying to use the most extreme words I can,

22

so that, then, you will either have to draw a

23

distinction or something.

24
25

MR. KEISLER:

That's why I'm ­­
But in some ways, the

distinction is the one I was drawing in response to

69
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Justice Sotomayor's question, which is that, when you

2

get down to the level of implementing these things, you

3

can take into account whether death, destruction,

4

starvation will be taken care of, when the State is

5

doing that as part of a SIP process.

6

But that doesn't bear on how the amount of

7

significant contribution is defined because, when EPA

8

takes costs into account it's not simply preventing the

9

death and destruction and starvation.

10
11

It's working the

other way, too.
It's saying that, even though a causation

12

standard only would require you to reduce this much, we,

13

the EPA, can shift to you an additional burden because

14

we think another State has already done enough.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They say that's not a

16

theoretical possibility, under the numbers they've

17

worked out.

18

process that permits individual States to challenge this

19

as applied?

20

So why isn't this taken care of in the

MR. KEISLER:

Let me make a distinction in

21

that regard, Your Honor, which is what the government

22

says is a theoretical possibility is simply whether a

23

State would be driven below the one percent threshold.

24

But what I'm saying really goes back to Justice Scalia's

25

very first question, which is, even apart from the one

70
Alderson Reporting Company

percent threshold, every time they are allocating on the

basis of cost and displacing what you would allocate on

you are shifting burdens around, even apart from the one

percent.

All right?

And that's, I think, where ­­ I think you
hit the nail as to what the issue is.
MR. KEISLER:

Yes, and I guess our position

13

is that significant may have a range of meanings, but

14

it's not a limitless range of meanings.

15

member of the Court once said the fact that yellow is

16

ambiguous doesn't mean it can mean purple.

I think one

And here ­­ you know, we don't think the range

18

of meanings in the context of this provision accommodate

19

the government's definition.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Keisler, the nature

21

of this problem is that there's an allocation issue.

22

It's not just everybody gets down to a certain threshold

23

level.

24

And the question is, what are we going to allocate on

25

the basis of?

It's there's a level, and we have to allocate.

12

So the statute ­­ neither the word "amount"

13

nor anything else says anything about those different

14

methods of allocation, does it?

MR. KEISLER:

Mr. Stewart's other example was a contribution to a

22

And I certainly would accept the notion that

23

if Bill Gates and I each contribute a hundred dollars to

24

25

MR. KEISLER:

All ­­ all

But if there were different

17

teams playing in the league and you had an overall

18

result, you could actually determine ­­ you know, which

19

team had contributed what to the overall result.

20

when we're dealing with States, we are dealing with

21

groups that the statute conceptualizes as separate teams

22

which are entitled to be treated separately.

23

And

But I would like to make just one other

24

point because I see my white light is on.

25

raised a completely separate argument.

76
Alderson Reporting Company

We have

It's the first

Official

1

argument in our brief, which is independent of how the

2

Court decides EPA may define the amount that contributes

3

significantly, whether cost or air quality effects or

4

anything else, and that is that, however it's defined,

5

EPA cannot regulate beyond the point necessary to

6

achieve attainment or maintenance in downwind locations.

7

And here, although in the prior two good

8

neighbor rulemakings, it specifically said it examined

9

the issue and avoided overkill, here, it didn't say that

10
11

because it didn't do that.
Apart from the cost versus air quality

12

issue, we had commenters that submitted evidence that

13

showed that EPA could achieve attainment and maintenance

14

at virtually all the same downwind locations at lower

15

levels of regulation.

16

And EPA's response to that, on Pet App

17

354(a), was they weren't going to look at lower levels

18

of regulation because, at lower levels of regulation,

19

some sources in some States might cease operating

20

existing controls, and that's all they said.

21

But if sources in some States could cease

22

operating existing controls and as the commenter said,

23

you would still achieve attainment and maintenance in

24

all the downwind locations that they are linked to, then

25

EPA has no authority under the good neighbor provision

77
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to require those sources to continue operating their

2

existing controls.

3

There may be authority under other

4

provisions, but not this one.

5

particular proceeding, said nothing else, gave no other

6

reason for refusing to act on the evidence that

7

commenters submitted, that lower levels of regulation at

8

most upwind States would still achieve attainment and

9

maintenance at downwind locations, and they had no

And the EPA, in this

10

authority to regulate beyond the point necessary to

11

achieve attainment and maintenance.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

18

MR. STEWART:

19

As Mr. Keisler indicated, in our reply

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

20

brief, we cited the ­­ the history of the restatement as

21

it bears on the common law of nuisance.

22

Court indicated in American Electric Power, if the Clean

23

Air Act had not been enacted, the remedy that downwind

24

States would have in a situation like this one would be

25

a Federal common law nuisance suit against upwind States

78
Alderson Reporting Company

And as this

or polluters in upwind States.
And I think there are three lessons to draw

3

from that fact.

4

argument in this case indicate, judicial resolution of

5

such a suit would have been a Herculean task.

6

prospect of doing that through judicial processes should

7

reinforce the wisdom of Congress' choice to replace that

8

mechanism with the Clean Air Act, and it counsels in

9

favor of deference to the expert agency that has been

The first is that, as the briefs and

And the

10

placed in the position that a common law court would

11

previously have been placed in.

12

The second is that, as the reply brief

13

citation to the law of nuisance indicates, the common

14

law court in that scenario would have been able to

15

consider the costs necessary to achieve reduction in

16

pollution upwind in deciding whether a particular remedy

17

would be appropriate or how much of a reduction an

18

upwind polluter should have to make.

19

reason, absent extraordinarily clear statutory language,

20

to deny EPA the same authority.

And there's no

21

The third thing is, as the analogy to the

22

common law suit indicates, there are sovereign State

23

interests on both sides of this case.

24

matter of EPA versus the States.

25

trying to act as an honest broker between the upwind and

This is not a

It's a matter of EPA

79
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

downwind States.
The next thing I would say about the Clean

3

Air Act is that the statute, as a whole, is replete with

4

references to economic activity and harnessing the

5

profit motive; that is, both the States and EPA are

6

specifically authorized to provide for the trading of

7

allowances, the whole purpose of which is to achieve

8

emission reductions in the most cost­effective manner

9

possible.

10

And I think it's worth noting in this regard

11

that, although we talk about the transport rule as

12

regulating the emission of ­­ emissions of States, what

13

we're really regulating is emissions of power plants

14

within the States, and the good neighbor provision,

15

itself, talks about preventing significant contribution

16

from emissions sources or emissions activity within the

17

States.

18

And one of the things that the EPA said in

19

the proposed rulemaking was that, in some circumstances,

20

the cumulative downwind impact of a particular upwind

21

State might be great, not because any particular power

22

plant was poorly regulated or emitting at a high level,

23

but because there were so many power plants in the same

24

State.

25

And one consequence of forbidding the EPA to

80
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

consider costs is that a particular power plant in an

2

upwind State might be required to install more expensive

3

pollution control measures and make greater reductions,

4

simply because it happened to be located in a State with

5

a lot of other power plants.

6

And the last thing I would say is this is ­­

7

the statute, as I've said before, has prospective focus.

8

It's intended to be implemented by State officials, and

9

if you ask how would a State official assure herself or

10

feel confident that her own State implementation plan

11

was satisfying good neighbor obligations, when she

12

wasn't really sure what other States might be doing, and

13

one way is if a State official said, if everybody else

14

did what I'm doing, I can feel confident that the

15

problem would be solved.

16

And that's really the approach that EPA

17

used.

18

at particular cost thresholds, we feel confident that if

19

everyone, upwind and downwind State alike ­­ alike

20

makes pollution control efforts at these levels, the

21

problem will be solved or at least almost solved because

22

there would still be slight residual nonattainment.

23

It examined certain cost thresholds, and it said,

And it seems perfectly rational to say that

24

the significant contribution is the amount over and

25

above what would occur, if everyone adhered to an

81
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

approach which, if applied across the board, would solve

2

the problem.
