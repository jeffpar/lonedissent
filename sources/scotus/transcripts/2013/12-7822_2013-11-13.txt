Mr. Fisher.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. FISHER:

9

please the Court:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

The doctrine of third­party consent is best

11

understood as establishing a rebuttable presumption.

12

When the police arrive at a house at which multiple

13

people live, they can assume, according to social

14

custom, that if one person grants consent to enter, that

15

person is speaking for everybody who lives in the

16

dwelling.

17

But when somebody is present and tells the

18

police officer that he refuses consent, that presumption

19

is reversed.

20

one person doesn't have a delegated authority to speak

21

for the others, they must respect the objection.

22

failure to do so violates the Fourth Amendment.

23

In other words, Matlock already gives the

in objecting, the police can assume, as this put ­­ as

2

this Court put it in Randolph, that asking that other

person wouldn't make a difference very often, and

4

therefore, they can presume that they would also consent

5

to the search.

So all we're ­­

pointed out in his separate opinion in Randolph.

the dwelling sometimes, but that's very different than

what's going on here.

that's a fair way to put the question here, which is

once somebody does exactly what this Court said they had

18

a right to do in Randolph, which is say, you cannot come

in my house, what happens next?

20

this case is that the police cannot nullify that

21

objection simply by involuntarily removing the person

from the premises.

And our proposal in

If the other person had been in the back

been away for a minute, Randolph by its terms would not

make it impossible for somebody to enforce it.

they remove you and make it impossible for you even to

require, at a bare minimum, if Randolph means anything,

it has to mean that.

numerous ways to help the police, Justice Kennedy.

hard for me to think of many examples, just to be fair,

20

where by providing oral information about what she might

be worried about, what she might think is in the house,

that have rights in that scenario, her and the

2

defendant ­­ or the suspect.

3

says is that searches of homes presumably have to be

4

done under warrant.

5

police have no reason to doubt that that consent speaks

6

not only for the person standing in front of them but

7

also for an absent person, they can enter, and that's

8

what happens most of the time.

And what the Constitution

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I

What about what we

Even if you think that somebody coming back

would think they could be invited in because the

objector is no longer gone, that is leagues away from

what the police asked to do here and what they are

15

contending they had the right to do, which is conduct a

general search of the premises.

MR. FISHER:

All you have to do is arrest

3

even if you didn't have the authority to arrest and

remove them, the police always have the authority to

5

exert control over the situation when they arrive at a

dwelling and to say to a homeowner, sir, would you

please come out to the curb and talk to me here, and I'm

Under their theory, even that ordinary,

boring part of police procedure extinguishes somebody's

12

gives the police total control, whether for good faith

or for bad faith ­­ and I don't think you're going to

impossible.

11

that the administrative efficiency is not a good enough

I think every one of these cases is

22

hypotheticals that ­­ some of which I've received today

23

24

friend coming back, those were the government's exact

25

arguments in Jardines, that somebody can come to the

why can't a police officer do the same?

5

And so

And this Court

The question is whether a stranger can come

curtilage of somebody's house.

8

question to ask, I think, because very few strangers are

going to do that.

But that's the question this Court

insisted on asking.

The officers did not justify their search on
