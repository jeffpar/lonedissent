But

10

So Congress knew about these statutes of repose when

11

they enacted this.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if you were to

13

prevail, then the parties concerned might well go to

14

their State legislatures and say, enact a statute of

15

repose.

16

injured person is aware of the injury and of the cause

17

of it.

18

what Congress meant to do in saying the trigger is when

19

you know the cause of the injury.

20

That will get us off the hook, even before the

The result of that would be to totally defeat

MR. MURRAY:

There has not been a rash of

21

move to State legislatures since this law has been

22

enacted, so we haven't seen that develop.

23

could respectfully disagree with the premise.

24

Congress's purpose here was slightly narrower than

25

saving all long­latent injury claims.

4
Alderson Reporting Company

But if I
I think

I think what

Official

1

Congress was worried about was expedition and making

2

sure that it didn't force people to come to court

3

before ­­ under a statute of limitations before they

4

would be expected to.

5

And that's set out ­­ the statute itself

6

accomplishes only one thing, Section (a)(1), and I'm

7

reading from page 1 of our opening brief to the Court.

8

"It does one thing only, which is if the applicable

9

limitations period for one of these actions as specified

10

in a State law statute of limitations or under common

11

law provides a commencement date that's earlier than the

12

Federal commencement date, then it substitutes the more

13

favorable commencement date."

14

Commencement date, in turn, if we turn to

15

page 2 ­­ and this is reading now from (b)(3) ­­

16

"Commencement date means the date specified in a statute

17

of limitations as beginning of the applicable

18

limitations period," which again, (b)(2), applicable

19

limitations period is defined as the period specified in

20

a statute of limitations during which one of these civil

21

actions may be brought.

22

So doing the algebra on the definitions,

23

what Congress surgically wanted to do here was to change

24

one thing and one thing only.

25

favorable State commencement date, which is the

If you had a less

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

beginning of which an action may be brought, which is

2

accrual, if you have one of these less favorable State

3

commencement dates for statute of limitations, Congress

4

wanted to move that, keeping in place ­­

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Why would it have wanted to

6

do that and not also get rid of the statute of repose?

7

I mean, presumably the idea is you should have some

8

chance to sue after you've discovered the injury and the

9

cause of the injury.

And if here, the statute of repose

10

is preventing that, why would Congress have wanted to

11

modify a statute of limitations but not get rid of the

12

statute of repose?

13

MR. MURRAY:

I think Congress was trying to

14

be very careful with what it was doing in this area

15

because it knew it was operating in pretty much the

16

heartland of State law and State prerogatives here.

17

And so while it was willing to go as far as

18

the one study group recommendation and change statutes

19

of limitations, a procedural mechanism, it wasn't

20

willing to go right into the heart of the elements of

21

the cause of action and start changing those because it

22

perceived potentially serious federalism problems with

23

doing that.

24

It would be akin to Congress passing a law

25

that says rather than ­­ since these ­­ negligence is

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what's at issue here.

2

passing a law saying the duty of care will be strict

3

liability.

4

problems with that as we've set out.

5

was very careful to tread lightly here and preserve the

6

prerogatives of the States to keep in place the statute

7

of ­­

8

Rather than negligence, Congress

I think there are serious constitutional

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so Congress

What would be the

9

constitutional problem if Congress had said all people

10

claiming an injury under this statute can commence the

11

action three years after discovery of the cause, to say

12

that?

13

MR. MURRAY:

To the extent that's a statute

14

of limitations period, it's not a problem.

15

extent it were to affect a statute of repose, North

16

Carolina law is very clear that statutes of repose are

17

an element of the cause of action.

18

unless you plead and prove this element of the North

19

Carolina law cause of action, you're out of court.

But to the

In other words,

20

Had Congress gone so far as to remove an

21

element, I think you're in dangerous constitutional

22

territory.

23

But ­­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

24

follow that.

25

is that right?

What kind of ­­ I don't

A statute of repose is a time limitation;

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. MURRAY:

It is.

But a statute of repose

2

is designed to accomplish something ­­ it's going after

3

very different objectives than Congress was after with

4

statutes of limitations.

And so what Congress did here was it left in
place State law as it found it, including the

10

limitations period, the time period itself, and all it

11

did was make one slight modification for those who might

12

not have thought to be able to be as diligent as others

13

and moved that date to a more favorable Federal

14

commencement date.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Suppose ­­ suppose a State

16

has ­­ most of these statutes of repose are piggybacked

17

on top of statutes of limitation, right?

let's assume you ­­ you have a State which only has a

23

statute of ­­ of repose.

24

for this act of negligence must be brought within 10

25

years after the act occurred.

I mean, you

But in any case, a suit

That's the basis of your suit, right?

But

It just says any suit for ­­

8
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Is that still a statute of repose?

It seems

2

to me then that would meet your ­­ your definition of ­­

3

of the commencement time for suit, would have to be

4

when ­­ when the act occurred, and then you have 10

5

years from that.

6

MR. MURRAY:

A statute written in that sort

7

of way which gives permission, which is exactly what

8

Congress was focused on, might well be a statute of

9

limitation.

It doesn't sound like a statute of repose

10

because, again, what Congress wanted to move was the

11

beginning of the period in which ­­

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

It doesn't give permission.

14

you're liable for negligence of ­­ in this ­­ in this

15

area, but any suit must be brought within 10 years after

16

the act occurred.

17

MR. MURRAY:

But that's the beginning.
It just says, you know,

To the extent that a statute

18

was that, and the State had only a statute of repose,

19

then we don't believe 9658 would touch that at all.

20

that makes sense because what Congress was doing was

21

taking State law as it found it ­­ and there's no

22

obligation for States to have these causes of action at

23

all.

24

there would be no right to sue.

25

their statutes of limitations to a day after accrual,

States could repeal these causes of action, and

And

States could change

9
Alderson Reporting Company

1

and that would be fine, too.

2

All Congress did was move the date on which

3

a statute of limitations begins to run till a later

4

date.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Murray, in Justice

6

Scalia's example, what in the text would prevent you

7

from treating that ­­ the single statute, which is

8

written as a statute of repose, what in the text is

9

preventing you from saying that the statute applies to

10
11

it?
MR. MURRAY:

Yes, Your Honor.

(B)(2) and

12

(B)(3) read together, we believe, are the two pieces

13

that would be most relevant.

14

to move is the commencement date when State law is less

15

favorable than Federal.

16

the beginning of the applicable limitations period.

17

applicable limitations period means a period in a

18

statute of limitations when suit may be brought.

you're not going to get any suits because nobody is

4

going to know that they're injured until they know that

5

they're injured.

of repose, the last act or omission, and ­­ and the

MR. MURRAY:

If we were in a State where you

were permitted to sue ­­ permission to sue was given

11

based on the last act or omission of a defendant, then

12

we would be in a different situation, but here

13

permission to sue does not arise until your cause of

14

action accrues.

15

act and omission of a defendant, which is what starts

16

the running of the statutes of repose, on the one hand,

17

and the accrual of a cause of action.

18

There's a distinction between the last

Yes, but my hypothetical

19

was different.

MR. MURRAY:

23

MR. MURRAY:

Right.

Well, and there ­­ but

24

to be clear, Congress hasn't always been perfectly clear

25

and certainly some of this Court's decision as with

12

language.

various laws, some of which have been presented in the

10

there any Federal statute that makes that distinction

to statutes of repose?

13

MR. MURRAY:

There's no Federal statute that

14

makes the distinction between limitations and repose,

15

but there are ­­ as we ­­ have been set out here, many

Federal statutes that give this hard­end, back­end

MR. MURRAY:

We think Congress understood

3

the distinction, and this is a harder question to

4

answer, but for those who find resort to legislative

5

history helpful here, remember what Congress did in

6

1980, they passed CERCLA and then they commissioned ­­

7

which was not about torts at all.

8

cleanup statute focused on, you know, without fault,

9

without liability, cleaning up land.

10

CERCLA is a broad

It then commissioned a study group of

11

leading folks to get together and figure out whether

12

there should be a tort cause of action, whether there

13

should be other changes made to the law, what else

14

should be done in the tort arena.

15

report was very clear on the distinction between

16

statutes of repose, on the one hand, and statutes of

17

limitations on the other.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but in general,

Mr. Murray, I think Justice Scalia is right, that, in

22

general, I think this goes back to ­­ to Justice

24

it doesn't matter either ­­ I mean, either way.

25

Congress wanted to make sure that people could sue after

The purpose behind this law, clearly,

If

2

that, as well as a statute of limitations does.

3

And yet you are asking us to imagine a

4

Congress that has this very much in ­­ in its head, both

5

the difference between these two things, and you said

6

the reason that they wanted only to alter the one and

7

not to alter the other is because they thought of the

8

statute of repose as impinging on a State's

9

constitutional prerogatives.

10

Now, that's a very legally

sophisticated Congress you're asking us to imagine.

11

(Laughter.)

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You know, to understand this

13

distinction and then to say, oh, yes, look, the statute

14

of repose is really an interference with substantive

15

liability in a way that the statute of limitations is

16

not and that might raise constitutional avoidance

17

issues.

18

pretty sophisticated stuff.

19

I mean, I think that's ­­ that's ­­ that's

MR. MURRAY:

Two points, Your Honor.

20

actually Congress, at least at this time, was very

21

sophisticated, and we've set out, again ­­

22

(Laughter.)

23

MR. MURRAY:

One,

For those who find legislative

24

history to be helpful, we've set out several exchanges

25

right on the floor between members of Congress where one

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would ask, what is the difference between a statute of

2

limitations and repose?

3

for asking, and explain it really quite succinctly.

4

that at least at that time ­­

5
6

Another would ask ­­ thank you

JUSTICE SCALIA:
to that.

So

And everybody was listening

The chamber was full and ­­

8

MR. MURRAY:

9

But my second point is, we don't have to

That was my first point.

10

rest on the broad construction of statute of limitations

11

versus statute of repose, sort of the broad definitional

12

purpose.

13

the statute here, which again, only does one thing,

14

moving a commencement date defined as the beginning of

15

the period in which one of these actions may be brought.

16

That simply does not define a statute of repose.

17

I come back to the text and the structure of

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that what

18

Congress was trying to do was to establish a Federally

19

required commencement date, a Federal requirement ­­ a

20

Federally requirement commencement date.

21

ask the question, how much time do I have to sue for one

22

of these CERCLA injuries, the answer would be three

23

years after you know the cause of your injury.

24
25

So when you

Now, on your ­­ taking out this statute of
repose, there can no longer be a uniform answer to that

question.
MR. MURRAY:

That's absolutely right.

All

3

Congress was ­­ there's no uniform answer to that

question because a statute of repose does not meet the

definition Congress set out in the statute as the

8

That is accrual.

And that speaks to statute

10

act or omission of the defendant, which is a statute of

distinction for Congress to make, given what they were

trying to do.

SUPPORTING PETITIONER
MR. PALMORE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Section 9658 surgically modifies State law

5

tort actions in one limited respect, and otherwise

6

leaves them untouched, by changing the commencement date

7

for the time period in which a civil action may be

8

brought.

9

The relevant time period ­­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, Mr. Palmore, if ­­ if

10

Congress ­­ if all of the States enact this 10 ­­

11

10­year statute of repose, then that has totally

12

undermined what Congress set about to do in 9658.

13

MR. PALMORE:

I respectfully disagree,

14

Justice Ginsburg, because Congress had before it a

15

report that identified the principal problem in this

16

area as when statutes of limitations periods commenced.

17

And it identified the problem as those ­­ that minority

18

of States that commenced this running of statute of

19

limitations period at a time of injury as opposed to

20

discovery of injury and its cause.

21

It's critical to understand here that there

22

were only four States, as counsel said, at the time that

23

Congress enacted this statute that had statutes of

24

repose, and those were States that all had discovery

25

rules.

There's no inconsistency between a statute of

18
Alderson Reporting Company

1

repose and a statute of limitations with a discovery

2

rule.

3

compromise and a balancing of interest on the part of

4

the States that makes enact ­­ enacted a, in a sense, a

of the repose statute is to say no discovery here.

Briefly, I just would cite ­­ just to

Construction Company, 446 S.E.2d 603 from the North

20

Carolina Court of Appeals, both of which made clear that

21

statutes of repose are conditions precedent that must be

22

specifically pled under North Carolina law.

23

But the broader point is simply this:

24

CERCLA as originally enacted is a cleanup statute

25

designed to tag people who have touched the property at

all with cleanup responsibility regardless of fault.

2

That's what it did when it was enacted in 1980 and

3

that's what it still continues to do today.

4

When Congress, in 1986, in response to the

5

study group report, enacted this 1960 ­­ 9658 section,

6

this small surgical change, it did so using defined

7

terms that ­­ and it said what it meant and it meant

12

beginning of the statute of limitations, not a statute

13

of repose, which commences with defendant's last act.

14

That is classic formulation at the

And again, this just makes sense.

In

15

drafting this statute, Congress was expressly trying to

16

minimize ­­ it may or may not have had in its head

17

specifically the presumption against preemption, but

18

this Court presumes that it does.

minimize intrusion into a traditional area of State

face says:

this, Congress wanted 50 flowers to bloom in this area

2

and it didn't cut that off.

And for good reason.

3

Repose is an important piece of this puzzle.

4

It's the counterbalance to the discovery rules that were

5

being enacted by these States in this tumultuous period.

6

By setting a statute of repose, you avoid the very real

7

possibility that a client like mine can be sued over a

8

site ­­ I mean, there's a fence around a hole in the

9

ground there now.

My client hasn't ­­ has abandoned

What Congress did here makes absolute sense

16

and the narrow and surgical way in which they did it,

17

given that they were acting in a traditional field of

18

State law supremacy, makes all the sense in the world.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, that last

20

argument about, you know, liability 30, 40 years later,

21

I think 46 States have that.

22

Congress wasn't all that worried about that and there

23

isn't a very strong policy argument that ­­ that says

24

it's not ­­ that it's so fundamentally unfair that you

25

shouldn't do it.

Have it that way.

MR. MURRAY:

Well, again, Your Honor,

2

actually, a lot of those States have statutes of repose

3

that deal with property specifically, not personal

4

injury.

5

a perfect match there.

6

in which Congress acted here is not at all surprising,

7

given that they knew they were acting in a traditional

State field, from the heartland of State authority
