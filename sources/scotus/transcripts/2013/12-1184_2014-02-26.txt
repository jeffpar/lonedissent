Mr. Telscher.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RUDOLPH A. TELSCHER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. TELSCHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
An exceptional case under Section 285

12

requires a court to assess the full range of traditional

13

equitable considerations, including the degree of

14

reasonableness of the merits by the plaintiff's action,

15

procedural aspects of the case, and evidence of economic

16

coercion.

17

prerequisites to an award of fees under Section 285.

18

The Federal Circuit's test conflicts with

Frivolous and bad­faith cases are not

19

the statutory language, it violates established canons

20

of statutory construction, and it deprives district

21

courts of the discretion they need to effectively combat

22

abusive patent litigation practices.

23

Below, the Federal Circuit found that ICON's

24

claims require a C­channel structure and that ICON's

25

claim construction to the contrary was without merit;

appendix at A10.

2

district court's grant of summary judgment that no

3

reasonable juror could find, as a matter of law, that

4

Octane's structure had an equivalent to the C­channel;

5

appendix A13.

6

The Federal Circuit also affirmed the

This means that ICON's infringement

7

allegations against Octane were meritless.

8

in combination with other undisputed evidence of

9

record ­­ namely the worthless nature of the patent,

10

evidence of economic coercion, and the fact that two

11

other elements of the claimed ­­ the core elements of

12

the claim were missing as well ­­ make this case

13

exceptional.

14

reverse the district court and award fees on its own.

15

This fact,

And it's such that this Court should

economic coercion.

17

that Octane had the patent and sued ICON.

18

analysis be precisely the same?

Suppose it were reversed.

competitor and you're suing a larger competitor, there

would be less opportunity for abuse.

The analysis would be

I've been listening to

5

there a difference between merit ­­ meritlessness and

6

objectively baseless?

7

I think you used the word meritless.

MR. TELSCHER:

What ­­ is

without foundation.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Because if we remand to

12

the district court, the district court's already said

13

it's not objectively baseless, it's not brought in bad

14

faith.

I'm not quite sure what words we're going to

MR. TELSCHER:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well ­­
You ­­ you had just said

18

that we should return it to the district court with

19

orders to require fee shifting.

20

if the discretion is to be exercised by the district

21

court?

22

And how could that be

I can understand your asking for a remand,

23

but I can't understand your asking for a reversal and an

24

order that the fees be reimbursed.

25

MR. TELSCHER:

We understand the tension

5
Alderson Reporting Company

between the discretionary standard and asking for a remand

2

with a finding.

3

rare ­­ not that rare, but they are rare enough ­­ where

4

appellate courts look at a record and have a firm and

5

definite conviction that an award should be made such

6

that it would be an abuse of discretion ­­

7

However, there are cases that are

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And you think this Court

8

is the proper court to look at the record and make that

9

determination, that the district court got it wrong when

10

the district court didn't think this was an exceptional

11

case.

MR. TELSCHER:

On this record, yes, Your

13

Honor.

16

possibility of success under 35 U.S.C. Section 112,

The ­­ the Federal Circuit's finding is such

JUSTICE SCALIA:

As a

19

do you want to add to meritless?

5

6

resolved against the plaintiff, so it ­­ just because

7

they lose a claim construction doesn't mean their

position was meritless.

MR. TELSCHER:

That no ­­ no reasonable

judge could have found it to be with merit?

If someone brings a claim

17

view that qualifies under Section 285 and is consistent

18

with the words that other cases have used.

standard I would ­­ I would want to, you know ­­ you

something tighter than that.

2

MR. TELSCHER:

That is the standard,

3

however, that this Court used in Martin and in Pierce.

4

And if we're looking at ­­ if ­­ if we want

5

to make ­­ so ­­ so in ­­ for example, in most of these

6

cases what we're talking about is going to typically

involve the merits.

8

you can get a fee award is to have a zero­merit,

9

frivolous case, it's impossible to show.

10

And so if we say that the only way

It's

inconsistent with the statutory language.

11

So when we're looking at this from a

12

statutory context, on the merits, what should qualify?

13

And there comes a point at which a case goes from strong

14

to medium and it crosses into the territory of weak.

15

gets weaker and weaker, and then it becomes frivolous.

16

This Court, even in Pierce, recognized that

17

the reasonableness standard was something more than

18

frivolous.

19

teeth in deterring the abusive practices currently in

20

the system, something more than frivolousness is

21

required, and it is consistent with this Court's prior

22

precedent.

And we think if Section 285 is to have any

We're deal ­­ we're

ways:

2

give some deference to the decision of the court that

3

was set up to develop patent law in a uniform way?

4

have a much better idea than we do about the

5

consequences of these fee awards in particular cases.

6

And since we're just ­­ as Justice Kennedy pointed

7

out ­­ dealing with adjectives ­­ you know, meritless,

8

frivolous, exceptional ­­ why don't give some deference

9

to their judgment?

10

MR. TELSCHER:

And why shouldn't we

They

Well, I think we need to look

11

at the basis of the judgment, which is grounded in the

12

fact that they've ­­ they've found constitutionally that

13

the ­­ the PRE standard was required.

14

Court's precedent in BE&K just two years earlier says

15

that the validity of fee­shifting statutes is not

16

governed by the PRE standard.

17

And I think this

And if ­­ if the Court were to so hold, that

18

would throw into question all of the fee statutes of

19

this country because, accordingly, they presumptively

20

would have to have the sham litigation test to be

21

constitutional.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What is the difference

23

between the Federal Circuit's use of objective

reasonable ­­ objectively meritless and your standard?

25

MR. TELSCHER:

To my way ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I know that you've been

2

arguing that they shouldn't be using subjective intent,

3

so I'm putting that aside.

4

Kilopass doesn't answer that now.

And you can tell me why

5

But what's the difference you see?

6

MR. TELSCHER:

To my way of thinking, when

7

you say meritless or baseless, it means there's

8

absolutely no foundation of zero merit.

9

about objectively unreasonable ­­ and, again, as this

10

Court found in Pierce ­­ it suggests something lesser

11

than frivolousness.

12

district court litigation is it's near impossible to

13

show that something is frivolous, that somebody had no

14

argument ­­

15

When we talk

And the reality of ­­ I think of

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't understand your

answer to the question.

17

Federal Circuit's test differ from your perception of

18

what meritless means?

19

MR. TELSCHER:

How does the first part of the

We understand the first part

20

of the Federal Circuit's test to require zero merit or

21

frivolousness, which is what the district court ­­ she

22

used interchangeably "objectively baseless" and

23

"frivolousness."

24

of a standard under 285.

25

So we think frivolousness is too low

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So would you say without

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

substantial merit?

2

words again.

3

I mean, if we're playing around with

MR. TELSCHER:

Without substantial merit,

4

unreasonably weak, or low likelihood of success, I think

5

those are all ways of getting to the same point, which

6

is something less than zero merit will satisfy under

7

285.

8

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

You have several objections,

I take it, to what the Federal Circuit has said.

One is

that you think objectively baseless is too low, correct?

11

MR. TELSCHER:

JUSTICE ALITO:

13

faith is necessary.

14

MR. TELSCHER:

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes.
You also don't think bad

Agreed.
And do you also believe that

16

litigation misconduct taken in conjunction with a case

17

that is, let's say, of little merit, but perhaps not as

18

low as the standard that you have, that you're

19

suggesting, would justify an award of fees?

20

MR. TELSCHER:

Yes.

We believe litigation

21

misconduct, especially in consideration with a weak case

22

on the merits, makes for a strong candidate for

23

exceptional.

exceptional if the standard is take everything into

3

account, litigation misconduct, the strength of the

case, any indication of bad faith, and decide whether

5

it's exceptional?

6

very little basis for comparison.

7

Exceptional compared to what?

I have

How do I do that?

So, I do not think it's a

they try to design around and a reasonable dispute

ensues.

Mr. Telscher, it occurs to

me that you really cannot answer the question of what

1

adjectives should be attached to meritless.

2

reason you can't is, since it is a totality of the

3

circumstances test, that is only one factor and it

4

doesn't have to be an absolute degree of meritlessness.

5

Even in a ­­ I assume you would say that even in a very

6

close case, if there has been outrageous litigation

7

abuse by the other side, the court would be able to say:

8

12
13

side.

And the

Couldn't the ­­ couldn't the court do that?
MR. TELSCHER:

That's absolutely correct,

Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

define meritless?

15

down, even in a case where it's ­­ it's a close case, it

16

could still be exceptional.

17
18

We can't, because it goes up and

MR. TELSCHER:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

too.

something very unjust about it.

it's just some more adjectives, and it's the test ­­ I

13

used those particular ­­ or that adjective, which is

14

your test.

15

MR. TELSCHER:

Section 285 is remedial, so

16

certainly in order to remedy something there must be

17

some level of injustice.

18

notion that a case is exceptional and uncommon is the

19

notion that it's gross injustice, not justice.

20

my way of thinking, when somebody brings a very weak

21

case, which we believe this one was, and it costs

22

someone $2 million to defend it, and they go through

23

that and they pay that price tag, a district court

24

should be able to find that that is gross injustice.

2

but the categories that you identified are the big ones.

3

So I don't think there is a laundry list,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think you ­­ you did

say if it's an exceptional case, the district court must

5

award fees, but the statute says may.

mind whether it's exceptional and in that same step

14

award fees.

15

determine a case is exceptional and then we make the

determination of whether fees should be granted.

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. MARTINEZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Section 285 grants district courts

5

discretionary authority to look at the totality of the

6

circumstances and award fees when necessary to prevent

7

gross injustice.

8

cases where the losing party has committed bad faith or

9

harassing conduct during the litigation, or has advanced

10

objectively unreasonable legal arguments, just as courts

11

had held under the 1946 statute.

12

restore this understanding of Section 285 and make four

13

additional points that we think will clarify the inquiry

14

for the district courts:

Such awards can be proper in unusual

The Court should

15

First and most importantly, the Court should

16

say that baselessness and bad faith do not both have to

17

be present in a case in order to justify a fee award;

18

Second, the Court should ­­ the Court should

19

say that district courts can grant fees based on a

20

combination of different factors even if no single

21

factor would necessarily support the award on its own;

22

Third, the Court should say that an

23

objectively unreasonable argument can trigger a fee

24

award, even if that argument is not so unreasonable that

25

it's actually considered frivolous;

19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

And fourth, the Court should say that clear
and convincing evidence is not required.

3

I'd like to turn to Justice Scalia's

4

question and the discussion that occurred earlier about

5

the battle of the adjectives, so to speak.

6

that, as I said earlier, that the ­­ a fee award should

7

be appropriate or can be appropriate in a case in which

8

there's an objectively unreasonable litigating position

9

or objectively unreasonable arguments that are made in a

We think

10

case.

11

precise, bright­line test, but we think it's similar

12

to ­­ it's, in fact, the same as what the Court has said

13

in other contexts, such as EAJA in the Pierce case ­­

14
15

We appreciate that that's not a ­­ a 100 percent

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No matter what other

factors exist, it has to be objectively unreasonable.

16

MR. MARTINEZ:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I ­­
I mean, even if it is clear

18

from other factors that this is a shakedown, a big

19

country ­­ a big company trying to suppress a little

20

company, even if it's clear that there has been

21

outrageous litigation abuse, misconduct by attorneys?

22
23
24
25

MR. MARTINEZ:

It is an important point,

Justice Scalia ­­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

All of those things cannot

justify shifting the award unless it is objectively

20

unreasonable.

2
3

MR. MARTINEZ:

No, Justice Scalia, that's

not our position.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

MR. MARTINEZ:

Oh, okay.
Our position is if the only

6

factor is an objectively unreasonable argument, that in

7

appropriate circumstances, that can be sufficient.

8

believe very, very strongly that if there are other

9

factors present, that would only strengthen the case for

10

We

appeal.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

I see that.

But, look,

12

what you listed in your brief on page 17, which I think

13

was nonexclusive:

14

misconduct, inequitable conduct by the patentee in

15

securing the patent, vexatious or unjustified

16

litigation, bad faith, the assertion of frivolous claims

17

and defenses.

18

those in different instances have been sufficient,

19

either alone or together.

20

that?

21
22
23
24
25

Willful infringement, litigation

And then you cite cases which say all of

Well, why don't we just copy

Isn't that your view?
MR. MARTINEZ:

I think our view is that

those are the kinds of circumstances ­­
JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Do you want to

add to that list, or to subtract?
MR. MARTINEZ:

I think as long as the Court

21
Alderson Reporting Company

makes clear that that is an illustrative list that I

2

think captures the kind of bad faith ­­

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You want to add et cetera,

right?
MR. MARTINEZ:

And add "or similar,"

6

"similar equitable" ­­ "similar inequitable conduct,"

7

which is what the Ninth Circuit said in the

8

Park­in­Theatres case, which I think all the parties

9

agree is a ­­ fairly captures what Congress intended to

10
11

incorporate from the cases decided in the late '40s.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So where does gross

12

injustice come from?

13

You say, Fees are authorized when necessary to prevent

14

gross injustice to the defendant.

I understood that to be your test.

15

MR. MARTINEZ:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think ­­
Again, you have your

17

long laundry list that doesn't say anything about gross

18

injustice.

19

MR. MARTINEZ:

Well, I think the long

20

laundry list reflects the kinds of circumstances in

21

which courts operating between 1946 and 1952

22

interpreting the prior statute, those are the

23

circumstances in which those courts had concluded that

24

there was a gross injustice.

25

think gross injustice is maybe the umbrella term and ­­

So in other words, we

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

You don't think it.

Where

2

it comes from, which maybe you don't want to say, is the

3

Senate report on the bill, that is similar to this one

4

enacted in 1946.

5

that's a highly relevant consideration.

6

Still, there are some of us who think

MR. MARTINEZ:

We are comfortable saying

7

that and we ­­ and we do say that and we think it's

8

especially salient and worth relying on here, not just

9

because it's the legislative history, but also because

10

that same legislative history and that same gross

11

injustice language was repeatedly cited and talked about

12

in the 1946 to '52 cases.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I think, Mr. Martinez,

14

what the Chief Justice is driving at is there's a bit of

15

a disconnect between your list of factors and those two

16

words.

17

really, really exceptional.

18

the conscience.

19

seen happen in the litigation system ever.

20

Gross injustice, I mean that's kind ­­ that's
That sounds like, shocks

That sounds like something you've never

But then you're saying essentially ratchet

21

it down when you list all of these various factors.

22

maybe that's ­­ that's right, we shouldn't be obsessed

23

with this word, gross injustice.

24

disconnect between the two words and all the factors.

25

MR. MARTINEZ:

And

It just seems a

Let me ­­ let me explain by

23
Alderson Reporting Company

3

stepping back.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

But it's in the Senate

report, so ­­

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. MARTINEZ:

Justice Kagan, we think that

6

the way to look at the statute is to try to figure out

7

what Congress understood the statute to mean in 1952.

8

And it's very clear and I think both sides agree that

9

Congress intended to essentially incorporate the ­­ the

10

thrust of the judicial opinions that had been issued

11

under the 1946 statute.

12

talked about gross injustice, drawing from the prior

13

legislative history, and when they awarded fees and then

14

when ­­ and when they discussed when fees would be

15

appropriate, the ­­ the circumstances that we list in

16

our brief are what they said would equate to gross

17

injustice.

Those opinions repeatedly

18

So I think in the abstract you may be right,

19

that gross injustice is a broader standard or maybe it's

20

a little bit ­­ it's a, you know, only the most

21

exceptional of exceptional cases would be covered.

22

in practice what Congress was looking at and what they

23

were responding to and what they were intending to put

24

in this statute was an idea of gross injustice that

25

reflected those bad faith, harassing, and unreasonable

24
Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official

1
2

situations that were presented earlier.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

So if that's what you mean,

3

why don't you say exceptional injustice instead of gross

4

injustice?

5
6
7
8
9

MR. MARTINEZ:

We're trying to tie the

interpretation of the statute to the language ­­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

To the Senate ­­ to the

Senate report.
MR. MARTINEZ:

Not just to the Senate

10

report, Justice Scalia, but to the judicial decisions.

11

And this Court has often looked to judicial decisions ­­

12

judicial decisions as a backdrop against ­­ against

13

which Congress legislates.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's a different statute.

15

Could we borrow from ­­ you mentioned EAJA.

16

that's substantially justified?

17
18
19
20
21

MR. MARTINEZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

I take it

We think

that ­­ that ­­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's a different statute,

It was passed later, all of ­­ all those problems.
MR. MARTINEZ:

We think that when ­­ when

22

the situation involves, say, just an objectively

23

unreasonable argument, we think that essentially the

24

same test would apply from the EAJA context.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So is there anything

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

other than the objectively baseless and bad faith of the

2

Brooks Furniture test that you would change?

3

all of the other factors that the Court uses ­­

4

litigation misconduct, all of that other stuff ­­

5

encompass all the factors you're talking about?

6

MR. MARTINEZ:

Doesn't

I think it does, but I think

7

it's ­­ it's very important if the Court were to go in

8

that direction, as long as it elaborates a couple of the

9

additional points that I mentioned earlier.

10
11
12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That it has to be a

combination, a combination of factors, and ­­
MR. MARTINEZ:

Both, yes, right, that both

13

are not required, that it can be a combination of

14

factors, that when the Brooks Furniture test says

15

unjustified, that is a ­­ that embraces the concept of

16

objective unreasonableness.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

By the way, I thought ­­

18

I thought the Federal Circuit said that you only use the

19

objective unreasonable if there isn't one of the other

20

things.

21

So it seems to be saying that ­­

MR. MARTINEZ:

I think they do, but I think

22

that catch­all category in which they apply the

23

two­pronged Brooks Furniture test covers potentially a

24

very wide array of cases, because it covers any case in

25

which perhaps there's bad faith conduct in bringing the

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

litigation, and also it covers the range of

2

circumstances in which frivolous or unreasonable

3

arguments are made.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And could you spend a

5

moment on clear and convincing, and ­­ because there's

6

not a whole lot in your briefs on that part of it,

7

although you do mention it in passing.

8
9

MR. MARTINEZ:
Sotomayor.

Right.

Yes, Justice

As the Court well knows, the standard rule

10

in civil litigation is that ­­ that facts need to be

11

established by a preponderance of the evidence unless

12

Congress says otherwise.

13

terms ago, I think confirmed that general view.

14

The i4i case, decided a few

Here, Congress did not say otherwise.

15

Congress did not embrace a clear and convincing

16

standard.

17

Section 285 that suggests that it did.

18

didn't have enough ­­ I wish we had had more time in our

19

brief to get into this issue, but I would just suggest

20

that if the Court wants to look more deeply, it can look

21

at Judge O'Malley's opinion in the Kilopass case, which

22

I think has a very thorough and very convincing

23

discussion of the clear and convincing evidence issue.

24
25

There's nothing in the text or the history of

7

When we're dealing with just

That's different from
That's a little higher than

MR. MARTINEZ:

It's not clear, Justice

8

Alito, how the Federal Circuit conceives of it, And let

9

me just explain why.

I think they use the term

10

objectively baseless.

11

they are talking about that term, they seem to use

12

frivolous as a synonym.

13

talking about that term, they seem to use objectively

14

15

confusion.

In some of their opinions when

In other cases when they're

And so we think there's a little bit of

16

We think the Pierce case makes very clear

17

that justified and reasonableness are the same thing,

18

and to ­­ that a reasonable argument is not the same as

19

merely a non­frivolous argument.

20
21
22

JUSTICE ALITO:

And that's higher than the

Rule 11 standard?
MR. MARTINEZ:

The Rule 11 standard, when it

23

comes to unreasonable arguments, is frivolous.

24

we think that it should be a little bit lower than that

25

standard and it should be closer to something like in

28
Alderson Reporting Company

And so

EAJA.
The ­­ I would like to get to the Chief

3

Justice's question earlier about why not defer to the

4

Federal Circuit's view on this statute, and I think two

5

principal reasons.

6

Federal Circuit's view really has any basis in either

7

the text or the history of ­­ of the ­­ of Section 285.

8

So that's reason number one.

9

First of all, I don't think the

Reason number two is I think if the Federal

10

Circuit had had a consistent view over its history or if

11

the Federal Circuit were not internally divided on this

12

issue, that may be a consideration.

more appropriate.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

analyzing every element of this case.

2

judge obviously presided over the entirety of this

3

litigation, analyzed the case for purposes of summary

4

judgment, and then reanalyzed the case for purposes of

5

analyzing the merits of ­­ of the claim and to ­­ and

6

whether or not this would be an exceptional case.

7

To be sure, it applied the Brooks standard,

8

but basically what it analyzed was just simply whether

9

there was an objectively legitimate basis for the

The district

10

decision.

11

keeps saying zero merit is objectively baseless.

12

not the standard.

13

objectively baseless means that there has to be probable

14

cause ­­ that it lacks probable cause to go forward,

15

that it has to be reasonably possible.

16

It's not that it has zero merit.

argument.
MR. PHILLIPS:

It is not my best argument, I

Alderson Reporting Company

(Laughter.)

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

On the other hand, if you ­­

4

if you go back and look at Christiansburg,

5

Christiansburg, in that case the court also didn't treat

6

it as a First Amendment issue, but it still recognizes

7

an important policy of ­­ of trying not to have too much

8

interference with access to the courts.

9

In any event, objectively baseless is a

10

standard that every court knows how to use and it goes

11

directly to the ultimate ­­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

from sanctionable misconduct?

14

the way you're articulating things, the conduct has to

15

be sanctionable before you can give attorneys' fees

16

under this provision.

17

provision?

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

How different is this
It seems to me that under

So why bother having the

Well, because the provision

19

was enacted in 1952, Justice Sotomayor, long before this

20

kind of litigation ­­ these kind of rules that would

21

have rendered the litigation sanctionable existed, and

22

so as a consequence of that ­­ and I think it's

23

important to put it in context.

24

Congress did this initially in 1946, to be sure, it's

25

the Senate report that talks about gross injustice, but

Because, you know, when

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it is the decisions of the courts that adopted that

2

approach of gross injustice.

3

1952, incorporates the exceptional case standard, the

4

revisor's notes say it's designed to go back to the

5

legislative history and the decisions that have been

6

interpreting that.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, you can't finally, but objectively baseless?

20

attorneys are very brilliant at figuring out just how to

do this.

in a suit if that's your standard.

Well, you add a couple of things, and then,

Okay?

Because it'll be very abstract

It will be able to patent almost anything.
Patent

So we're never going to have attorneys' fees

MR. PHILLIPS:

But you could couple that

couldn't have an exceptional case where attorneys' fees

should be shifted.

say it's objectively baseless.

13

pretty close to whatever that line is, which I can't

describe and look at all this other stuff.

15

going to say that I can't shift?

16

But if I'm honest about it, I cannot

MR. PHILLIPS:

I can just say it's

Are you

I think the problem with the

17

approach you propose there, Justice Breyer, is you're

18

trying to deal with a very small slice of the problem of

19

litigation.

20

You know, what you've described ­­

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, but I’m ­­ of course,

21

it may be a small slice of litigation, but it is a slice

22

that costs a lot of people a lot of money.

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

But the problem ­­
And so I would like to know

if I do run across that small slice why cannot I, the

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

district judge, say, I've see all these things, taken

2

together they spell serious injustice, and therefore,

3

I'm shifting the fees.

4

Okay?

Why can I not do that even though, as I've

5

just said and repeat, I cannot in honesty say it's

6

frivolous given the standards for patenting that seem to

7

be administered?

8
9

MR. PHILLIPS:

Because when Congress enacted

the statute, adopted the exceptional­case standard, it

10

meant, essentially, to require that the litigation be

11

unjustified and vexatious.

12

baseless.

13

along.

14

merit, but it has to have enough merit to be ­­ to

15

satisfy the standards of probable cause.

16

Unjustified means that it is

That's the understanding that existed all

It has to have ­­ it's not that it has zero

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, baseless is at the

17

end of the day ­­ I mean, you have a case that involves

18

a straight stroke rail that at one end goes in an

19

elliptical arc, and the district judge had to figure

20

this out with all the experts.

21

all the underbrush, he finds there's nothing there.

22

it's hard to say that that's objectively baseless to a

23

district judge who's spent weeks studying this thing.

24

But at the end of the day, suppose he finds there's

25

nothing there?

After he goes through

35
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, if at the end of the

2

day there's nothing there, then I think it is

3

objectively baseless, even though they've gone through

4

the litigation.

5

But what the district judge ­­

JUSTICE BREYER:

Not nothing there.

It's

6

highly abstract language.

7

read some of these claims.

8

understand and when you get to the bottom of it, the

9

abstract nature of the language, plus the fact that it

10

has something to do with computer input, plus the fact

11

that, you know, you suspect very strongly it's baseless,

12

but you really don't like to say something that isn't

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, why don't why don't

we just take ­­ there's another statute, as you know,

says exceptional means not run of the mine, uncommon.

D.C. Circuit.

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17
18

I read that opinion.
Why don't we say, Well,

we have it there in the Lanham Act, the same words.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

But there are a

19

couple of reasons for that.

20

statute was passed long before the Lanham Act was

21

enacted and against a very different backdrop, and

22

Congress clearly, in literally sticking its toe in the

23

water of allowing prevailing defendants to get fees from

24

plaintiffs in a situation was pretty unprecedented at

25

that point in time, set the standard very high and

One is obviously this

38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

intended for it to prevent gross injustice.
The legislative history of the Lanham Act,

3

which this Court apparently was willing to read for

4

those purposes at that time, doesn't ­­ doesn't remotely

5

suggest that.

6

that opinion the ­­ the standards under the Patent Act

7

in interpreting the Lanham Act.

8

could make the argument the opposite way ­­

9
10
11

And the Court didn't take into account in

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So it seems to me you

But you just look to ­­

MR. PHILLIPS:

­­ which is that the Lanham

Act ought to be interpreted ­­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

the question is really who is likely most to know.

But then if you

So I say, Well, then go to the Federal

16

another way of approaching it, and that is have definite

standards, which is what you want.

18

difficulty with definite standards is I can't think of a

some, so then I say, Okay, let's try the first approach,

4

whole long story.

5
6
7

That's the

And what you would like to say, I'd like to
listen.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

And the answer to

8

that is that the standards for inequitable conduct are

9

reasonably well set.

10
11

They get applied pretty routinely,

and they create exceptional­case determinations.
Litigation misconduct, the standards are

12

pretty well set, pretty well understood, and they give

13

rise to the exceptional­case determinations and award of

14

attorneys' fees.

15

This case is unusual in the sense that all

16

it deals with is that bucket that talks about whether or

17

not you had a substantial basis for putting before the

18

Court this litigation in the first instance.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And ­­

Mr. Phillips, I realize that

20

you have this argument that this statute was before

21

Rule 11, so the superfluity argument doesn't work.

22

But just as a matter of fact, would your

23

standard give the court authority to order fees in any

24

case in which it does not have authority by virtue of

25

either Rule 11 or its inherent authority?

44
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

Are ­­ are you ­­ are you

asking me that just about the baseless litigation or all

3

of 285?

infringement, and ­­ and certain forms of litigation

5

So, yeah, I mean, there ­­ there's clearly

some overlap between them, but that ­­ that overlap

13

shouldn't be shocking because, again, 285 was enacted in

14

1952, and Rule 11 didn't come into being a serious force

15

until 1983.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But let me make sure I

17

understand you.

18

under your standard, 285 could be used to order a

payment of fees, but Rule 11 and inherent authority

like that.

Well, litigation misconduct

is something that may or may not go against the party,

19

depending on which rule it is and how it plays out.

20

there ­­ and the courts have long recognized that

21

something's an exceptional case.

I can't envision a situation where you have brought what

a court has said is objectively baseless litigation in

the first instance that might not have been actionable

5

at this ­­ at this stage it would go immediately against

the party as opposed to potentially against the lawyer.

7

And ­­ and to that extent, it obviously provides broader

relief, depending on which of the two parties might
