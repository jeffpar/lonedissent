Mr. McCracken?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD G. McCRACKEN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. McCRACKEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Many employers and unions find agreements

12

such as this useful to avoid conflict during organizing

13

campaigns.

14

feelings that come in many contested organizing

15

campaigns and thereby create a good environment for

16

collective bargaining.

17

of the Labor Management Relations Act, those being

18

freedom of contracts, organizing employees for

19

collective bargaining, and labor peace.

20

They are efficient.

They avoid the hard

They serve the core objectives

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I ­­ I think there's

21

substantial force to that argument.

would be exactly like the Ventimiglia case from 1957

In this case, the all ­­ the

only thing given by the union was a promise not to

effort and to ­­ and to arbitrate in the event that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Okay.
So suppose the company

manufactures widgets and the union says, we'll spend

$100,000 advertising your widgets if you so ­­ if you

9

sign the recognition agreement.

MR. McCRACKEN:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

MR. McCRACKEN:

Yes.

I think ­­

Is that lawful?
It would be lawful because

the union would not have received any widgets.

Well, the ­­

the argument that Justice Scalia and Kennedy are

referring to it, is that the employer paid with the

13

14

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. McCracken, the

Respondent's brief here asserts that these kinds of

6

precertification agreements have only been common since

7

the ­­ the '90s.

8
9

Is­­ is that accurate to you?

MR. McCRACKEN:

It is not, Justice Scalia.

There ­­ there's an article from the Cornell Industrial

10

Labor Relations Department by Eaton and Chriskey showing

11

that these agreements go back to the 1970s.

12

13

that there's an explanation that the neutrality

agreement between Dana and the UAW was first signed in

So these go back quite a bit further.

16

Also, they really go back in a rudimentary

17

way much further than that to the Lion Dry Goods case,

18

which was a ­­ an agreement with a non­incumbent union

19

and department store employers in Cleveland that

20

provided, among other things, for access.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Sometimes there's a

22

conflict between two different groups that want to

23

unionize the same workforce, right?

MR. McCRACKEN:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Doesn't that suggest

it's a thing of value in ­­ in this context?
MR. McCRACKEN:

It's certainly not a thing

10

of value in the sense of marketability, because the one

11

union could not sell it to the second union because the

12

other union could get it free from the employer because

13

the employer must give equal rights to all comers.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

In the typical case, how

15

important is an agreement like this to the union?

16

much does it increase the likelihood that the union will

17

be selected as the exclusive bargaining representative?

18

MR. McCRACKEN:

mentioned, Justice Kagan, shows that the differential is

slightly different from Justice Kagan’s question, can you give

Yes.

tell you from my experience, if I may, that these

Section 302 cannot be read in isolation from

the words "thing of value" in Section 302, the promises

it's been accepted by the lower courts.

3

Court were looking at the language of the statute today,

4

Section 10(e) of Section 302(e) of the statute, which is

5

on page 11a of ­­ of our brief, gives the district

6

courts jurisdiction to hear violations of this case ­­

7

of this statute, and courts have assumed that private

parties could invoke that.

seem to be squarely presented here.

14

squarely presented here is whether the Court should read

crime because there was a thing of value, a thing of

3

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, under this statute, the

4

government's position is that the three terms that are

5

at issue ­­ "neutrality," "access," and "employee list"

6

­­ are not prohibited by Section 302.

7

way to reach that conclusion is to determine that

8

Congress did not intend that these three things be

9

viewed as things of value under the statute.

10

Probably the best

Certainly, read in isolation, the words

"thing of value" are very broad.

some corruption involved.

unions may set ground rules even if the employer and the

6

union benefit from the agreement.

7

I just read the passage and all

So you seem to be construing the Eleventh

Circuit decision to say something it didn't say, to say

9

that organizing agreements violate 302.

10

MR. MESSENGER:

Well, I would say two

11

things.

12

individual provisions, not organizing agreements as a

13

whole.

14

gag clause, the use of property, and the information,

15

not the agreement.

16

First, the issue of course are the three

The three things at issue here of course is the

But secondly, the Eleventh Circuit's opinion

17

comes from its holding that this intangible assistance

18

can't be delivered, it can only be paid, and therefore,

19

the court held you needed to show consideration for

20

payment.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22

MR. MESSENGER:

Where is that?
It's at the Eleventh

23

Circuit's opinion, right above the section that you just

24

read from, where the court held that it didn't believe

25

that things could be delivered, which we disagree with,

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

but they can be paid; and therefore, if consideration is

2

given, then you have a violation.

3

to say that consideration would show that the purposes

4

of the statute are implicated by the transaction,

5

because in that case the union is being influenced by

6

what the employer gave.

7

And then it goes on

So the Eleventh Circuit, when it said that

8

not all ground rules agreements will violate 302 was

9

saying that if no consideration was given, there would

10
11

be no payment and therefore no violation in that.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It says ­­ it says that,

12

at the end of that passage, curbing bribery and

13

extortion are implicated.

14

MR. MESSENGER:

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

16

MR. MESSENGER:

Yes.
And said that's what ­­
If there is consideration.

17

So if the employer gives this assistance and the union

18

gives something in return ­­ for example, here the

19

$100,000 political campaign and agreement not to

20

strike ­­ then it becomes a payment, because the

21

consideration shows payment.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

23
24
25

What is your position on

the effect of the expiration of this agreement?
MR. MESSENGER:

I don't believe that it

renders the case moot, for two reasons, the first of

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

which is that UNITE has pending a lawsuit to compel

2

arbitration in which it is alleging violations of the

3

agreement that occurred before it expired.

4

the remedies the union is seeking is to have the

5

agreement extended for a longer period of time, which is

6

a remedy it received before.

7

currently pending in Federal district court.

8

stayed pending these proceedings.

And one of

And that lawsuit is
It's been

9

And then the second reason is UNITE

10

continues to demand this organizing assistance.

11

302(b)(1) makes it illegal for a union to demand a thing

12

of value, even if it doesn't receive it.

13

clearly still demanding that Mardi Gras help it organize

14

its employees, so Mulhall still has standing to seek

15

injunctive relief to stop the union from demanding those

16

things.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

UNITE here is

Mr. Messenger, could ­­

could all of these things that the employer gave to the

19

union be included in a finally­negotiated collective

bargaining agreement?

For example, access for union stewards

The information.

During collective

11

bargaining, a union has a right to information under

12

Section AEP 5 of the National Labor Relations Act.

13

Giving that information would fall under the exception

14

found at (c)(2), which provides for the release of any

15

claim that a union may have.

16

legal claim to that information under the NLRA, so if

17

the employer agreed to provide it or did provide it, it

18

would fall under that exception.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And so the union has a

Mr. Messenger, do I

20

understand the structure of your argument to be as

21

follows:

22

afterwards in a collective bargaining agreement along

23

the lines that Justice Scalia said, the only thing that

24

an employer can promise a union or agree to provide to a

25

union are things that are specifically authorized in

That whether before certification or

30
Alderson Reporting Company

1

other parts of the labor law?

2

your argument?

3

MR. MESSENGER:

Is that the structure of

Yes, Your Honor.

And

4

because in the collective bargaining, a union of course

5

is supposed to act as an employee representative and not

6

for itself, so most terms of collective bargaining

7

agreements go to the employees, not to the union itself.

8

302's whole purpose or primary purpose is precisely to

9

prevent such self­dealing.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You see, I would have

11

thought that the premise and the policies of the labor

12

laws are to encourage a wide variety of

13

employer/employee agreements, both things that are

14

listed in the labor laws, that are provided for in the

15

labor laws, but many things that are not; that the idea

16

is to get these parties together to reach agreements on

17

a wide variety of things that matter to them regardless

18

whether the labor law specifically refers to that.

19

MR. MESSENGER:

Well, the structure ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It seems sort of turning the

21

whole thing on its head to say that the only things that

22

are allowed in terms of promises, whether in a

24

the things that the law itself requires.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that an exchange of agreements for purposes of peaceful

2

recognition, terms that were given for that purpose were

3

legal, but that things given for ­­ that were not solely

4

for recognition, but had value outside of that, like money,

5

would be wrong.

6

That 100,000 is troubling to me because I

7

think what the circuit was saying is if the 100,000

8

bought the peaceful recognition provisions, then that's

9

corrupt, and that is outside the exemptions that the law

10
11

provides.

That's how I read its decision.

Tell me why I'm wrong about that and tell me

12

how I deal with that niggling problem I have about the

13

$100,000, because it does feel like a bribe to the

14

employer.

15

MR. McCRACKEN:

And the ­­ reading the

16

Eleventh Circuit's decision is actually somewhat

17

difficult, because the ­­ it appears that the court

18

suspected that there must be something else in the

19

picture that had not been disclosed and that's why it

20

ordered the district court to find out why the two

21

parties had cooperated with each other, despite the fact

22

that no one had alleged anything else in the picture

23

besides what is before us all now.

24
25

The ­­ so it seemed that the court was
puzzled that an employer would agree with the union to

54
Alderson Reporting Company

1

cooperate in this fashion.

2

The cooperation ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't think it ­­ it

3

was puzzled by the provisions at issue.

4

puzzled by the 100,000.

5

MR. McCRACKEN:

Yes.

I think it was

And the ­­ the 100,000

6

was not a cash payment to anyone, although it might have

7

been.

8

action committee that had been formed to advocate for

9

this initiative.

It might have been a contribution to a political

But instead, it was actually the

10

union's own exercise of its speech and petition rights

11

as it campaigned for the passage of the initiative that

12

would allow the company to get into business in the

13

first place as a casino.

14

So, if the violation turns on the union's

15

exercise of its own First Amendment rights, then there's

16

a more severe problem here than Section 302, I believe.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but there was

18

a promise to exercise the First Amendment rights in a

19

particular way up to the amount of $100,000.

20

MR. McCRACKEN:

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22
23

Yes.
That ­­ that's a

little different.
MR. McCRACKEN:

It's a little different, but

24

also very similar to the promises that are actually on

25

the face of the memorandum itself, because the union

55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

agrees to waive its First Amendment rights to engage in

2

picketing and boycott activity, as well as the employer

3

waiving some of its rights with respect to its freedom

4

of speech.

5

So this is a case where there are multiple

6

waivers of rights, both speech rights and property

7

rights, going back and forth between the two parties for

8

a central, completely legitimate purpose, and that is,

9

the employer getting into business and the union getting

10

the opportunity to organize its employees.

11

there is in this picture, is the union, like so many

12

construction unions that we know, advocating in Congress

13

for the passage of laws like the Keystone Pipeline Law.

14

Why did they do that?

That's all

They do it because

15

they want the jobs.

16

industry develop a pipeline, that their members will

17

work on those jobs.

18

funneled through the First Amendment's protection for

19

mutual effort, as the Court recognized in Pennington,

20

and, of course, the Noerr­Pennington Doctrine is one of

21

our most important constitutional protections.

22
23
24
25

They hope that if they help the

That is a combination of interests

That's all that happened in this case.

So

there's nothing nefarious about it.
What ­­ there is ­­ there are some extremely
damaging things that the Respondents' very simplistic

56

1

argument will ­­ would accomplish if it were adopted.

2

Justice Kagan referred to the ­­ the grievance

3

procedure.

4

Well, there's also arbitration in this

5

agreement, as well as in collective bargaining

6

agreements.

7

exception for arbitration, even though the Court has

8

said over so many years that it is the most important

9

thing under the Labor Management Relations Act.

But one searches in vain in 302(c) for any

10

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

Thank you, counsel.

Counsel.
