ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD SREBNICK

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SREBNICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
When the government restrains private

12

property, the owner of that property has the right to be

13

heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.

14

For a criminal defendant who's facing a criminal trial,

15

whose property has been restrained, that time is now,

16

before the criminal trial, so that he or she can use

17

those assets, that property, to retain and exercise

18

counsel of choice.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I ­­ you know, I ­­ I

20

Find it hard to think that ­­ that the right of property

21

is any more sacrosanct than the ­­ the right to freedom

22

of the person, and we allow a grand jury indictment

23

without ­­ without a separate mini­trial to justify the

24

arrest and ­­ and holding of ­­ of the individual.

25

if he ­­ if he doesn't have bail, he's permanently in

3
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

jail until the trial is over.

2

just on the basis of a grand jury indictment.

3

you're telling us it's okay for that ­­ maybe you think

4

it's not okay for that.

5

And we allow all of that
And

But I think you're saying it's okay for

6

that, but it's not okay for distraining his property.

7

I ­­ I find it hard to ­­ to think that it's okay for

8

the one and not okay for the other.

9
10
11
12

MR. SREBNICK:

Justice Scalia, it's not okay

for either.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Ah, okay.

This is a bigger

case than I thought.

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. SREBNICK:

The right to be released on

15

bail, that is, the right not to be detained all the way

16

until trial, under this Court's precedent in United

17

States v. Salerno, the Court provided procedural

18

safeguards to ensure that, before someone is held all

19

the way until trial, they would have a hearing, a

20

hearing which would include a right to challenge the

21

weight of the evidence and other factors.

22

We ask for something no different.

Indeed,

23

the indictment itself can justify the detention of the

24

body and the detention of the asset until such time ­­

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that's ­­ I'm sorry.

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

That's pretrial detention without bail.

2

Justice Scalia's question had to do with detaining

3

someone who was indicted, but couldn't make bail.

4

MR. SREBNICK:

I thought

Every person is limited by

5

their own financial wherewithal, and so long as bail is

6

set not as an excessive bail, he or she must rely on the

7

assets that he or she owns.

8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:

But why, in that situation,

would the defendant not have the constitutional right to

10

have a determination by a judge as to whether there was

11

probable cause?

12
13
14

MR. SREBNICK:

In the context of a bail

hearing, a judge does make that determination.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Does it?

There are

15

several factors that are taken into account.

16

them is weight of the evidence.

17

two things, probable cause to believe that the defendant

18

committed the offense and weight of the evidence as one

19

of several factors, to take account over the bail

20

determination?

MR. SREBNICK:

One of

22

Ginsburg.

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought your

answer might have been that, yes, in fact, the property

6

is entitled to greater protection because it's going to

7

be used to hire counsel that will keep the person out of

8

jail long term, even if he can be put in jail pending

9

the trial.

10

MR. SREBNICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, we've

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I—I

see the government's

of probable cause is sacrosanct, and a hearing like the

5

one that you are proposing would call the validity of

that finding into question.

Why don't you address that because we­we

were talking about, in bail, the validity of the charges

10

are demonstrably tainted can be restrained over the

11

objection of the defendant who needs those assets to

12

retain counsel of choice.

not to allow the restraint of those assets that are

14

demonstrably not tainted.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Today, I'm asking the Court

Can I ask what the prospects

16

of success at a hearing like this are?

17

there's an amicus brief which lists 25 cases in the

18

Second Circuit, in which this kind of hearing was held.

19

My clerk went back and found that, in 24 of those cases,

20

the motion was denied, and in the 25th, the motion was

21

granted, but then reversed on appeal.

23

really.

the point.

6

MR. SREBNICK:

I think that's

Actually, I believe that the

7

brief of the New York Council of Defense Lawyers that

8

Justice Kagan refers to points out that there are many

9

other cases where, at the courthouse steps, the parties

10
11

resolve the question of the restraint of those assets.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And I suppose, if

12

the government knows it's got to go through a hearing

13

where it has to lay out part of its case, it may well

14

decide at that point it's not worth it, so it's not 24

15

or 25.

16

government would have sought to seize the assets, but

17

didn't because they knew they would have to justify it

18

at a hearing.

19

Who knows how many hundreds of times the

MR. SREBNICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, that may

20

be so, but it appears that the government does exactly

21

that, every day, in Federal court during pretrial

22

detention hearings, when it proffers its case in order

23

to convince a judge to detain a defendant, and we're

24

asking for something no different.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you said something

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

about plainly tainted assets.

I thought that the

2

hearing was given on the traceability of the assets to

3

the crime.

4

to challenge the connection between the assets and the

5

offense, right?

So on­on that part, the­ the defendant isn't allowed

6

MR. SREBNICK:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Everybody agrees with

8

that.

So there is a possibility to say, you said we

9

have untainted assets, but the defendant in this case

10

said, I concede that these assets are related to the

11

charged offense.

12

MR. SREBNICK:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

We

13

distinguish between tainted and traceable to.

14

below granted us a hearing to determine whether the

15

assets restrained were traceable to the conduct in the

16

indictment.

17

indeed, I think we have shown it on the record before

18

district court, is that, even though the assets that are

19

under restraint are traceable to the conduct, the

20

conduct is simply not criminal.

21

The court

What we would like to show at a hearing ­­

And we'd like the court to hold a hearing

22

which would not bind the court at trial.

Again, no

23

different than courts hold in civil cases with Rule 65,

24

this interim decision is not a determination of whether

25

the grand jury got it right or wrong.

It's a

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

determination of whether the government presented a

2

sufficient case on that day to satisfy its burden.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

There's been a suggestion

4

that, if the judge were to find that there was a lack of

5

probable cause, the prosecutor would be under an ethical

6

obligation to dismiss the charges.

7

that?

8
9

MR. SREBNICK:
necessarily.

Do you agree with

Justice Alito, not

It would depend on why there was no

10

so­called probable cause.

11

something known to the prosecutor that would constrain

12

him or her ethically, perhaps.

13

If it was based on a ­­

But if it was simply because the prosecutor,

14

on the day of the hearing, only presented one witness

15

instead of all five, that would not constrain the

16

prosecutor ethically in any way.

17

The prosecutor retains the discretion to

18

decide how strong a presentation to make at this

19

hearing, no different than the prosecutor would have to

20

make that same decision at a preliminary hearing, at a

21

pretrial detention hearing or plaintiffs have to make at

22

a Rule 65 hearing.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

And what if it's the same

24

evidence ­­ the same evidence is introduced before the

25

grand jury?

Let's say it's a credibility determination.

Alderson Reporting Company

the judge finds the prosecution witness not credible.

3

Is there, then, an ethical obligation to dismiss the

The lawyer's

Justice Scalia, in this case,

if the hearing would go forward, the only way the

lawyers would be paid is if there would be a finding by

the court that the conduct at issue will not give rise

to forfeiture.

rely upon that judicial decision to establish the bona

I understand that, Justice

There was analysis of the statute ­­

JUSTICE BREYER:

Here it is.

It says,

11

"Thus, it's plainly aimed at implementing the commands

12

at 853(a) and cannot sensibly be construed to give the

13

district court discretion to permit the dissipation of

14

the very property that 853(a) requires to be forfeited

15

upon conviction."

Okay?

16

MR. DREEBEN:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Exactly.
Exactly.

That's what it

18

says.

19

850(a)(3)(A) does not require the defendant to­to forfeit

20

upon conviction, for there can be no conviction because

21

there is no evidence, and, therefore, I don't find that

22

that sentence in Monsanto destroys the use of the word

23

which Congress put in, "may."

24
25

So the claim here is this is property that

MR. DREEBEN:

I­I don't think that there is

any serious question that Monsanto meant to preclude

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

free floating discretion.

2

question of probable cause, and the Court squarely held

3

that assets in the defendant's possession may be

4

restrained in the way that they were here, based on a

5

finding of probable cause to believe that the assets

6

were forfeitable.

7

What it did was focus on the

Okay.

So far, this is very

8

And what he did is

Now, they are saying that's not that, and

Let­ let

me start with the fact

7

that I think that there is harm, and there is very

8

little benefit, and I want to turn to both sides of that

9

empirical equation.

Before the Court concludes that,

10

for the first time, a grand jury indictment can be

11

contradicted by a judicial finding that there is no

12

probable cause, albeit on different evidence, the Court

13

should have a good reason to think that grand juries go

14

awry in a sufficient number of cases, so that this

hearing which will have costs, as I'll describe, is

worth doing.

It may be because the government, particularly

when it may have tenuous probable cause basis, decides

it's not worth it to go through this hearing to seize

and retain the assets.

13

And it just seems that the statistics are

phony, in the sense that, where the impact of this is

even go through the process of restraining the assets.

19

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I

20

agree with you that those cases exist.

21

they exist, where the government determines that the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And that's the whole

24

point, which is you talk about compulsion on the

government, but the compulsion of the defendant not to

have a hearing because they are required to say

something that could put them at greater risk, whether

it's because of the enhancements for obstruction of

justice or merely from losing the advantage of their

defense at trial, that's why these hearings are so rare.

I think it's less about the government not

wanting to disclose its case and more about the

inducements against the defense wanting to preview its

case.

10

MR. DREEBEN:

And also, the stark

unlikelihood that the defense will prevail, unless the

government is forced not to go through with the hearing

because of concerns about which ­­

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can I ask you a related

15

question, since it came up?

I was curious as to how

16

much of this forfeiture money gets to victims.

17

best we could do is looking up three years, and on the

18

basis of the figures that I got out of the DOJ on that,

19

about 25 ­­ 20 to 25 percent goes to a category called

20

third­party interest.

21

So the

Now, the third­party interest includes

22

mortgagees, it includes other creditors, it includes

23

States, who want taxes, et cetera.

all those, a rough guess would be 5 or 10 percent goes

25

to victims.

look at the actual amount in general, but the interests

at issue here are, one, this money goes to pay for a

of depriving the recipients of the forfeiture monies,

that it intends to use.

it's hearsay, it's a description of the crime, rather

than a detailed evidentiary presentation of the kind

that Petitioners want here.
