ORAL ARGUMENT BY HARRY F. TEPKER, JR., ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

_2
_8

MR. TEPKER:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:

_9

In this case Oklahoma has decided that a fifteen year

10

old boy lost his moral entitlement to live because he committed

11

a brutal murder, the killing of the ex-husband of his sister.

12

According to the prosecution evidence the motive for

13

this murder was revenge, revenge for the ex-husband's abuse of

14

the boy's sister.

15

Certiorari to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals.

16

Petitioner asked this Court to vacate the sentence of Death,

17

but not the judgment that Wayne Thompson was guilty; and not

18

the judgment that he deserves punishment.

11

This case comes before this Court on

Two basic issues in this case relate to one

20

fundamental principle:

21

fundamental justice of the Death Penalty and emotion and

22

prejudice do not.

23

the principle that Youth bears on the

First, does this principle require a minimum

24

chronological age, or at least standards and instructions that

25

tell the sentencing authority that their examination of non

1

adulthood should not be truncated.

2

inflammatory photographs of the murder victim's decomposing

3

remains undermine the reliability of this Death sentencing

4

process ?

5

Second, did introduction of

Wayne Thompson was still a child under state law when

6

he shot and killed the ex-husband of his sister.

7

the prosecution's most incriminating evidence, the boy on the

8

night of the murder shortly after the crime, confessed to his

9

mother and explained to her that his -- sister "would not have

10

According to

to worry about her ex-husband any more."

11

Wayne was certified to stand trial as if he were an

12

adult.

13

instructed that Youth is a relevant mitigating circumstance

14

they could consider, but they were not told that Youth is a

15

relevant mitigating circumstance of great weight.

16

told that they could decide for themselves what were and were

17

not mitigating circumstances.

18

before the jury that sentenced Wayne to death.

19

The jury was told that he was an adult.

The jury was

They were

These were the instructions

Under these circumstances and in a very real sense,

20

this case comes before the Court presenting this Court with the

21

first opportunity to decide whether or not Wayne Thompson was

22

too young to be condemned to death.

23

circumstances of this case, as well as under circumstances

24

generally applicable to a class of children and adolescents, it

25

is most inappropriate under the Eighth Amendment, under the

We submit under the

4

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, to inflict

2

the Death Sentence.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. TEPKER:

5

The reasons for treating Youth in a special manner

6

have been recognized by this Court on a number of occasions.

7

We submit that these factors, these reasons for treating Youth

8

in a special way are compelling in this particular

9

circumstance:

How old is he now?
He is 20 now, Your Honor.

first children and adolescents are simply too

10

inexperienced to be judged by the same standards applicable to

11

adults.

12

the understanding, the capacity for self-control, to be judged

13

by standards according to adults.

14

whether they know the difference between right or wrong, but

15

whether they have the experience to apply those standards, to

16

resist the stress, the trauma, the difficulties -- of

17

particularly difficult occasions.

18

They have not been around long enough to formulate

The question is not merely

We submit that, in addition to that, it is quite

19

plain that children, adolescents, are far more vulnerable to

20

volatile, impulsive, self-destructive behavior, and this,

21

recognized by this Court in the past, is grounds for treating

22

Youth, youths, in a different manner, particularly when the

23

punishment is Death.

24
25

QUESTION:

Mr. Tepker, do you think that it would be

a violation of the Eighth AMendment to execute a minor who has,

Heritage

5
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

for example, reached the age of 17 years and nine months, at

2

the time the offense is committed, and who is found on an

3

individual determination to have the moral culpability of an

4

adult?

5
6

7

MR. TEPKER:

Your Honor, we argue for a minimum

chronological age.
QUESTION:

Yes, I know you do, but my question is, do

8

you think that it is a per se violation of the Eighth Amendment

9

under the circumstances I describe?

10

MR. TEPKER:

Yes, we do, Your Honor.

We contend that

11

18 is the most dominant traditional definition of non­

12

adulthood, and in this situation, when you are short of

13

eighteen, the chances -- excuse me?

14

QUESTION:

In the abortion context, this Court has

15

held that a minor can and must be treated as an adult upon

16

proving her individual maturity to be so-treated.

17

say in this context, we may not do that and the Constitution

18

says we may not.

19

And yet you

That is a little bit inconsistent, perhaps.

MR. TEPKER:

I think not, Your Honor.

I think there

20

is a difference between defining the reality and significance

21

of adulthood for a non-adulthood for purposes of inflicting the

22

Death Sentence, and making that same calculation when what is

23

at stake is the fundamental right of privacy.

24

balancing, that inquiry, is not the same, and I do not suggest

25

that Bellotti v. Baird or other cases which recognize the

Those — that

I must insist that the question you pose is not the

question before this Court in one sense.

maturity beyond his years.

constitutionally insufficient or inadequate?
MR. TEPKER:

13

On Kent v. U.S., yes, but we are not

14

relying upon those at this point.

15

question really here is whether the certification process

16

negates the need for some focused attention on non-adulthood in

17

relation to the Death Penalty?

That time has passed.

Certification proceeding is not geared toward —

Did the Petitioner asks the trial court to

instruct the jury to consider age as a mitigating factor?
MR. TEPKER:

21

He did not, Your Honor.

Well, excuse

22

me:

he did ask for an instruction that Youth was cited by the

23

Defense as a mitigating factor.

instruction that we suggested in our brief were not requested

by trial counsel.

MR. TEPKER:

That is the one that seems most logical

to us based upon tradition.
QUESTION:

14

anyway, would it not?

15

MR. TEPKER:

But we do --

Of course, 16 would not save Mr. Thompson

It would indeed, Your Honor.

And if

16

this Court took the position that it wanted a greater consensus

17

and it wanted to establish a floor that was truly a minimal

18

floor, the fact that no state, having decided to select and

19

express limitation on the Death Penalty, has selected an age

20

below 16, might make 16 indeed the most logical line for

21

purposes of federal constitutional law.

22

provide the range of alternatives that would be necessary to

23

resolve this case.

24
25

QUESTION:

We have attempted to

Mr. Tepker, are there some states other

than Oklahoma in which a minor below the age of 16 could be

8

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

sentenced to Death?
MR. TEPKER:

2

There are indeed, Your Honor.

But 60

3

percent of the jurisdictions in this country, encompassing 70

4

percent of the population, would not tolerate this execution.
QUESTION:

5
6

That is, 60 percent of the jurisdictions

which provide for capital punishment?

7

MR. TEPKER:

No.

That is 60 percent of the states

total.

Death Penalty, establish minimum lines that would not allow

10

It is approximately half of the states that retain the

this execution.

QUESTION:

12

MR. TEPKER:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. TEPKER:

And half of them do not?
Yes, that is right.
And half of them would allow it?
Half of them allow the potential for it,

15

although I might add, if one takes into account the more

16

general question of whether Youth bears upon the fundamental

17

justice of the Death Penalty, Oklahoma is one of only three

18

states that has neither a minimum line nor any special

19

legislative declaration that Youth is a mitigating

20

circumstance.

21

to have someone on Death Row who is a juvenile.

22

And it is -- the only one of those three states

QUESTION:

Did the trial judge not say that the jury

23

could take Youth into consideration as a mitigating

24

circumstance here?

25

MR. TEPKER:

He did, Your Honor.

Heritage

But then he said,

9
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

"what is a mitigating circumstance is up to you to decide."

2

submit that that violates the spirit of Eddings v. Oklahoma, in

3

which this Court said, "Youth is a relevant mitigating

4

circumstance of great weight, and it violates the principle was

5

stated in a concurring Opinion in Skipper, which you joined,

6

which says Youth bears directly on the fundamental justice of

7

the Death Penalty.

We

The instructions left the jury with the impression
that they had complete discretion over the matter.

Moreover,

10

the jury was told, contrary to the legal facts, that he was an

11

"adult," when they asked that question of the trial judge.

12

trial judge responded, "yes, he is an adult."

13

under the laws of Oklahoma.

14

QUESTION:

The

He was a "child"

You say that the jury should have been

15

instructed that Youth is a mitigating factor and you should

16

take it into consideration in your deliberations?

17

MR. TEPKER:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

And it should

18

have been correctly informed as to his status under Oklahoma

19

law that he was a "child" under the laws of Oklahoma.

20

For all these reasons, we submit there is great risk

21

in this case apparent from the Record that the jury's inquiry

22

into Youth, into non-adulthood, was truncated.

23

truncated by the failure to answer the jury more specifically

24

when they asked about the meaning of the word,

25

It was truncated when the jury was told he was an adult.

It was

"mitigating."

10

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

It

1

was truncated when they were not told in specific,

2

particularized ways, that Youth is at the heart of this case,

3

and that they must make a judgment on that question.

4
5

QUESTION:

court told the jury that he had been certified as an adult?

6

MR. TEPKER:

7

QUESTION:

8
9

Did the Petitioner object when the trial

No, he did not, Your Honor.
And did he raise the point in the Oklahoma

Court of Criminal Appeals?
MR. TEPKER:

On the issue of adulthood, no, but the

10

Oklahoma Appellate Public Defender did raise the issue that

11

more particularized guidelines focusing the jury on the

12

mitigating circumstances was necessary.

13

would have required the overruling of an explicit Oklahoma

14

Court of Criminal Appeals decision, Chainey v. State, in which

15

particularized guidelines are not allowed under Oklahoma law.

16

We submit that this process made it very clear that

And, I might add, that

17

there is a constitutionally unacceptable risk that non­

18

adulthood was not weighed in a sensitive, careful, reasoned way

19

in this particular case.

20

We also submit that this case also has additional

21

facts that make this inappropriate occasion for infliction of

22

the Death Sentence.

23

Criminal Appeals, inflammatory photographs of decomposing

24

remains of the murder victim were introduced and used by the

25

prosecutor in the closing argument during the Death sentencing

process.

3

QUESTION:

Was the effect of those photographs raised

below?

4

MR. TEPKER:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. TEPKER:

Yes, it was, Your Honor.

The --

On the sentencing phase?
On the — well, there is an ambiguity in

7

the Record on that point, Your Honor.

The Appellate Public

8

Defender argues strenuously that it was erroneous to admit the

9

photographs.

The argument of the Appellate Public Defender did

10

not distinguish between the sentencing phase and the guilt

11

phase, but it was not focused solely on the guilt phase.

12

The Appellate Public Defender also criticized the

13

trial prosecutor for his use of the photographs in closing

14

argument, also in connection with mischaracterizing the

15

defendant's age.

16

QUESTION:

Do you think there is any constitutional

17

difficulty, Mr. Tepker, in introducing a photograph that shows

18

the brutality of a killing if in fact the killing was brutal?

19

I mean, if there was six or eight wounds on the body, do you

20

think there is some reason why that photograph simply showing

21

those wounds could not be introduced?

22

MR. TEPKER:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. TEPKER:

25

Perhaps, Your Honor, although, I -What is the source of your reservation?
Well, I recognize it is an extremely

difficult task to ask this Court to get into the business

12

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

difficult and unpleasant of what photographs are too gruesome

2

and what photographs are not.

3

Criminal Appeals found the photographs to be "ghastly,

4

gruesome, calculated only to enflame the jury, and proving

5

virtually nothing."

6

QUESTION:

7

10

Is this because of their submersion for

almost a month?
MR. TEPKER:

8
9

Here the Oklahoma Court of

That is right.

I mean, the photographs

depicted the biology of decomposition, not the brutality of the
crime.
QUESTION:

11

But how — if the prosecutor had some

12

other photographs that did not show the decomposition, but

13

showed the brutality, that would be one thing.

14

impression is here there were not.
MR. TEPKER:

15

But my

There was no choice.

If the photographs were probative of the

16

way in which the crime was committed, probative and relevant

17

for those grounds, then I would think that would be an entirely

18

different case, Your Honor, one that would bear upon the

19

fundamental justice of the Death Penalty because of the

20

aggravating circumstance of what is "cruel, atrocious and

21

heinous."

22

But that is not the situation here:

the Oklahoma

23

Court of Criminal Appeals said these photographs "proved

24

virtually nothing."

25

QUESTION:

But Mr. Tepker, no, but they said that in

13

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

saying they were not relevant to the determination of guilt.

2

MR. TEPKER:

3

QUESTION:

Yes, that is true.
So we do not really know whether they

4

thought they were really relevant to the determination of the

5

appropriate Death sentence -- the appropriate penalty.

6

just -- there is nothing in their Opinion that tells us whether

7

they thought they could appropriately be considered in

8

connection with sentencing.
MR. TEPKER:

Well, Your Honor, I would suggest this:

10

The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals denounced the

11

introduction of these photographs in very strong terms.

12

then said they were harmless as to guilt or innocence.

13

no indication whatsoever that these photographs could be

14

admissible during the sentencing phase.
QUESTION:

15

They

And
It gave

It gave no indication one way or the other

16

on admissibility in the sentencing hearing, that is all I am

17

saying.
MR. TEPKER:

18

That is a fair characterization, Your

1

Honor.

We submit, however, that because of the way in which

20

the Oklahoma -- excuse me, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal

21

Appeals, described these photographs, facts that they found in

22

relation to the inflammatory nature of these photographs, the

23

constitutionally unacceptable risk that the jury was distracted

24

from its duty, distracted from the true assessment of what is

25

an appropriate -- sentence, is plain and apparent on the

14

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1
2

Record.
If I may return to the basic, what we have tried to

3

describe in our arguments as the "narrow Eighth Amendment"

4

arguments, it is very clear that almost all jurisdictions --

5

some 94 percent of the jurisdictions either have a minimum line

6

or have something in their legislation which clearly indicates

7

that cases involving youthful offenders are special.

8

deserve to be treated differently.

9

along with the other factors surrounding the judgment of the

They

That degree of consensus,

10

Young in a capital sentencing case, make it particularly

11

appropriate for this Court to declare now, to reaffirm, that

12

Youth bears on the fundamental justice of the Death Penalty.

13

QUESTION:

That is not what we are asked to do.

That

14

does not win you your case.

15

statistic would be what percentage of the states have aligned

16

that would have rendered this sentence inappropriate.

17

MR. TEPKER:

It seems to me the relevant

Your Honor, what percentage is that?

18

Sixty percent of the jurisdictions encompassing 70 percent of

19

the population with an absolute line --

20

QUESTION:

What jurisdictions that have criminal —

21

that have capital punishment -- it is, of course, irrelevant

22

with respect to those jurisdictions that have chosen not to

23

impose capital punishment at all.

24
25

But as to those that have, you say about half of them
would not have allowed this sentence?

Heritage

15
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

MR. TEPKER:

That is true.

The percentage is half.

2

Although I must suggest that when we are considering the nature

3

of the Death Penalty in considering the judgment of the Young,

4

to throw out those states that have decided the Death Penalty

5

process is uncertain enough, or illogical enough, or perhaps

6

too cruel, out of the calculation of what are evolving

7

standards of decency, is to not inquire into what the consensus

8

really is.

9

QUESTION:

We really have no idea what they would

10

think about Youth as a factor, had they chosen capital

11

punishment:

12

We have no idea if they have not chosen it for the -- for

13

adults or for youthful offenders.

14

about whether if they did have it they would consider that

15

Youth is a factor that would render it absolutely intolerable.

16

they simply have not chosen capital punishment.

MR. TEPKER:

So it really says nothing

Well, let me shift then to trying to

17

suggest that this Court has used international opinion and

18

international law in order to assess what are evolving

19

society's standards of decency.

20

21
22

QUESTION:

We would not have capital punishment at

all if we were to be bound by that, would we not.
MR. TEPKER:

I am not certain about that, Your Honor.

23

And I am not attempting to challenge or restrict the Death

24

Penalty here at all.

25

reject this kind of executions, and 40 of those nations retain

What I am suggesting is that 80 nations

2

nations in terms of the rarity of these kinds of executions,

3

the clear statements that appear in the International Covenant

4

of Human Rights, and the American Convention of Human Rights,

5

it becomes very clear that there is an objective rejection of

6

execution of children, and Wayne Thompson was a child under the

7

laws of Oklahoma.
QUESTION:

9

If you add to that the practice of the

Does the federal government place any

limitation upon age with regard to the statutes in which it

10

allows capital punishment to be imposed?

11

jurisdiction.
MR. TEPKER:

12

13

Not the federal

I am unaware of a federal death penalty

that goes to the question.

14

QUESTION:

That goes to the question?

15

MR. TEPKER:

Yes, I guess I am unaware of the answer

16

to your question.

I did not think that there was authorization

17

on the part of the federal government for a death sentence of

18

juveniles.
QUESTION:

19

Not of juveniles, but there are -- there

20

is a Death Penalty in the Federal Code.

Is there any

21

limitation upon the imposition of that upon juveniles?
QUESTION:

I do not know the answer to that, Your

24

QUESTION:

You do not know that there is?

25

MR. TEPKER:

22
23

Honor.

I do not know that there is.

17

Heritage

1

The reasons for this great consensus -- and I must

2

suggest strenuously it is a very strong consensus, really

3

reflect the fact that it is so terribly difficult to make

4

judgments about anybody at this tender age.

5

before, there is an inexperience factor here.

6

As I suggested

There is also the sense in which these people at this

7

age have not been in command of their own lives.

They have not

8

taken responsibility for establishing a place in the community

9

separate from family, from friends, and from parents.

For all

10

of these reasons, generally it is extremely difficult to make a

11

judgment about a child or adolescent.

12

QUESTION:

Do you have any statistics which could

13

tell us how many juveniles have been prosecuted for offenses

14

carrying the Death Penalty?

15

MR. TEPKER:

Prosecuted for offenses carrying the

to come up with.

That is an extremely difficult statistic

The best we have in our brief is the

10

difference in proportion, the differential proportion based

11

upon arrests for criminal homicide, and of course, that

12

presents a problem about which arrests for criminal homicide

13

are in fact capital offenses.

14

With respect to the uncertainty of the judgment, I

15

would like to draw attention to the brief, the amicus brief for

16

the American Society for Adolescent Psychiatry, which

17

eloquently summarizes the evidence that what is happening with

18

respect to the juvenile Death Sentence is not a situation where

19

these individuals are being sentenced based upon a judgment

20

that they have a maturity beyond their years; they are being

21

sentenced to death despite their evident immaturity and

22

retarded development.

23

The fact is that the American Psychiatric

24

Association, when it discusses the diagnosis of "antisocial

25

personality," states very clearly that such a diagnosis should

ORAL ARGUMENT BY DAVID W. LEE, ESQ.

2

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

3
4

MR. LEE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

5

In my view, this case involves two questions:

6

whether it was cruel and unusual punishment to impose the Death

7

sentence upon the Petitioner in this case; and whether this

8

Court should set as an aspect of the United States Constitution

9

a minimum chronological age under which no state could go in

10

imposing the Death sentence regardless of the circumstances of

11

the individual crime irrespective of the individual of the

12

defendant's maturity and background in each individual case.

13

In the present case, the Petitioner murdered the

14

victim one and one-half months prior to the Petitioner's 16th

15

birthday.

16

enforcement officers, seven of which occurred prior to the

17

murder in this case; four of those incidents involved assaults

18

on a person and two of those involved assault with a deadly

19

weapon.

20

to witnesses as he left his house on the night of the murder,

21

"We are going to kill Charles."

The Petitioner had nine contacts with law

Testimony at trial revealed that Petitioner announced

The victim died after having been brutally beaten;

22

23

having his throat cut; and having been shot in the back of the

24

head.

After the murder, the Petitioner told witnesses on two

2

callous comments after the murder that revealed that he felt no

3

remorse, a fact that was corroborated by the testimony by the

4

psychologist who examined him and by his juvenile officer.

5

The Petitioner made other several other

Concerning the question of the Petitioner's age, the

6

State contends that the adoption of the Petitioner's argument

7

that this Court should set a minimum chronological age would

8

require this Court to engage i artificial and arbitrary line

9

drawing with regard to the decision whether to impose the Death

10

sentence upon a young murderer.

11

eleven years, this Court has stressed the need for

12

individualized decisions, regarding the Death sentence.

13

contend also that there is no reason why age should be given

14

any greater consideration or any greater weight than any other

15

mitigating circumstances such as those involving mental

16

retardation or mental illness.

17

In its Decisions over the past

Furthermore, a significant class of violent criminals

18

in this country should not automatically be immunized from the

19

possibility of receiving the Death sentence.

20

unquestioned that this Court has itself recognized in the

21

Eddinqs case that young criminals increasingly engage in

22

violent crime and to announce in advance that none of them,

23

under any set of circumstances, could receive the Death

24

sentence regardless of the maturity that they displayed or the

25

viciousness of the crime that they commit would be in our view,

It is

to send the wrong message.

2
3

QUESTION:

I did not hear the last part, "It would be

in your view," what?

4

MR. LEE:

That to announce in advance that, under no

5

circumstances, regardless of the maturity the individual

6

defendant displayed or irrespective of the viciousness of the

7

crime that that defendant committed, we feel that would send

8

the wrong message to other potential young murderers in this

9

country.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

Then you would say the same thing to those

states which do not have the Death penalty for adults?
MR. LEE:

Well, we think that the individual states

13

should be allowed the discretion whether to impose the Death

14

penalty or not.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

I am merely saying that your argument

would apply to states without the Death penalty equally?
MR. LEE:

Well, of course those states have the right

18

to choose whether or not they want to impose the Death penalty

19

on a person of any age, and we think that if a state chooses to

20

announce to the potential killers in that state, that in

21

appropriate circumstances, if they commit a particularly

22

vicious act, they too are subject to the Death penalty.

MR. LEE:

Justice Stevens asked that question of me

1

in the Eddinqs case in 1981 and I told him at that time in my

view it would be a violation of the Eighth Amendment to impose

the Death penalty on an individual that is ten years of age.

MR. LEE:

QUESTION:

11

Yes.

We concede that it would.

That would

10

It would be?

What about 12?
We do not think that this -Then you see, what I am going to do is I

am going up the ladder -- where would you draw the line?
MR. LEE:

We do not think that this Court should

12

decide in advance what that minimum age should be.

We think

13

this Court should merely look at the facts in each individual

14

case and review what Oklahoma has done in this individual case.

15

Right now there are no people on Death Row in America

16

and there have not been who are under the age of 15 years old

17

at the time of the commission of the crime.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

But you would say that any ten-year-old,

no matter where he is, may not be executed?
MR. LEE:

I think that there would be common and

21

unanimous agreement among all people that that would be too

22

young for an individual to receive the Death penalty.

23
24
25

However, we think the country is divided with regard
to the minimum age with imposing of the Death sentence.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lee, when is the last time that a

The particular act in this particular case was not an

25

impulsive, but the fact is that this individual defendant did

Heritage

25
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

not commit an impulsive act.

2

fact that he had a motive to kill his ex-brother-in-law shows

3

even more that it was calculated and planned and it was

4

certainly not an impulsive act.

5

QUESTION:

It was a considered act.

The

Mr. Lee, may I ask you, when you conceded

6

that the execution of a ten-year-old for murder would be

7

unconstitutional, are you resting that on a violation of the

8

"cruel and unusual punishment" clause of the Eighth Amendment?

9
10
11
12

13

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, I think that would

violate anybody's sense of decency under the Eighth Amendment.
QUESTION:

There is nothing in the Eighth Amendment

that would suggest such an exception, is there?
MR. LEE:

Well, obviously, this Court is going to be

14

the arbitor as what do constitute -- what does constitute a

15

situation that would violate the consensus of the public in

16

this country that an execution of a person of a particularly

17

young age would be unconstitutional.

18

fact that there are 19 states in this country that allow the

19

execution of an individual under the age of 16, I think you ask

20

people generally, and they are divided, particularly if you

21

show them the individual facts of individual murder cases, for

22

example the case that this Court heard last Term, the

23

Christopher Burger case.

24

about what should be done with that individual, and I think

25

that there would be a lot of people in this country that would

Heritage

But we think that the

If you ask general public opinion

26
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

agree that he should be executed.
This particular case involves, I think, a very

2

3

serious crime, although the victim in this case was not a

4

particularly appealing person, he underwent a very horrible

5

murder; he had his -- the pathologist testified that all of the

6

wounds that he had inflicted upon him were inflicted on him

7

while he was still alive until the time that he was shot in the

8

back of the head, so I think that this particular case,

9

particularly in view of the fact that this individual had had

10

previous contact with law enforcement officials, I do not think

11

that this particular case involves a violation of the Eighth

12

Amendment.

13

We also contend that a rule of constitutional law

14

that would set a minimum chronological age for imposition of

15

the Death penalty would make no allowance for any increase in

age is bad, because you have accepted a rule of constitutional

law that uses a chronological age, have you not?

I am saying that this Court does not have

to say what that minimum chronological age would be.

under the age of 15.

QUESTION:

MR. LEE:

We do not have to say it in this case?
Yes, or at any time.

I do not see -- like

12

I said, there has been nobody that has been 14 or under who has

13

received the Death Penalty in this country in recent years, and

14

I am just asking the Court to make an individualized

15

consideration in this case as it insisted the states do in

16

other Death Penalty cases.

17

QUESTION:

You say, Mr. Lee, that there had been four

18

or six in recent years that received a death penalty under

19

sixteen?
MR. LEE:

20

Since 1984 in my — according to my

21

calculation there have been six individuals under the age of

22

16 .

12

1967, although there are 2,000 people on Death Row.

15

Penalty being imposed on a young person, and we certainly

16

welcome that.

of Dr. Margaret Meade and others who testified that the age of

24

it is also significant, I think, as we pointed out in our

Justice Blackmun asked me if 12 should be

bright line, if there was a case directly before this Court, if

17

there is any bright line, Age 14 is the age of common law age

18

incapacity, and this Court in two previous cases, the Gault

19

case and the Ford case, which you yourself wrote, Justice

20

Marshall, you used the common law as the guideline for, in that

21

particular case, for the imposition of the Death Penalty on

22

somebody who was insane.

23

Also, Blackstone, in his Commentaries on page 23,

24

25

to 14 is the common law age of presumed incapacity.

Court used Blackstone when it pointed out —

QUESTION:

Why we

cannot set a huge bright line at 18.
MR. LEE:

I think it is unnecessary for the Court to

10

do so, particularly in this case.

11

said from Griggs on that a defendant should receive

12

individualized consideration; that there should be allowances

13

made for the imposition — for the jury to impose mercy in a

14

particular case; what is important that an individual's

15

character and background should be viewed by the jury.

16

I think that the Court has

That was done in this case.

It was done by the

17

certification judge before the individual was certified to

18

stand trial as an adult; it was viewed at the time that the

19

jury made the decision; they found the existence of an

20

aggravating circumstance; he was free to introduce evidence of

21

any mitigating circumstance; he received an instruction that

22

the youthfulness of the offender had been offered as evidence

23

of mitigating circumstances.

24

defendant, his attorney argued in his closing argument in the

25

second stage that age was a consideration; in their own brief

Heritage

And we think that this individual

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

they pointed out -- I took one statement by the prosecutor out

2

of context, but the Record shows that, particularly on page

3

160, the prosecutor specifically told the jury that in the

4

second stage of the trial, that age is a relevant mitigating

5

circumstance — a comment he made at least two times during the

6

voir dire examination.

7

So we think that as long as the jury, and the jury

8

has traditionally been held to be that link to evolving

9

standards of decency in the community, and Justice Stevens in

10

his Dissent in Spaziano said as much.

11

In this particular case, 12 people heard all this

12

evidence and made the decision that the Death Penalty should be

13

imposed.

14

And we think that it was appropriate.
It has been observed that chronological age is an

15

inherently poor criterion standard by which to draw the line

All I am saying is in particular cases involving

MR. LEE:

Yes, and I know that particularly Justice

4

Blackmun has been concerned, like in his Dissent in the Burger

5

case, he was concerned about the possibility that there might

6

be domination by other individuals.

7

In this particular case, this individual was tried

8

separately; there was nothing like there was in the Burger case

9

that would prevent his attorney from presenting mitigating

10

circumstances with regard to this case; there is not one word

11

in the Record to suggest that this individual acted under the

12

domination of anybody else.

members that testified that could have testified if Mr.

14

Thompson at one point had said that his family --

QUESTION:

He certainly had enough family

Some of his family was involved in the

MR. LEE:

Well, there was one half-brother that was,

but he made statements to a number of family, or at least close

19

friends, to family members -- there were certainly plenty of

20

family members around that could have testified that he made

21

the comment that he did this because he was afraid of Tony Mann

22

or because they made him do it.

23

The Record is clear in this case that this individual

24

acted of his own free will and volition in this particular

case, and there is no inference whatsoever that he was

As I have noted, we think that the -- it is important

minimum age should be.

7

should be.

8

9

And it was unclear until the oral

We believe that common sense tells us that, if asked
what the minimum age for the imposition of the Death Penalty

10

should be, most people would say that it depends on the

11

individual facts of the case, including the seriousness of the

12

crime and what that individual defendant is really like.

13

We contend that the objective factors of this case do

14

not support the Petitioner's position.

15

state supreme courts that have ruled on this issue, have

16

rejected the contention that age alone should bar imposition of

17

the Death sentence.

We contend that there is no unambiguous trend in this

country with regard to the raising or lowering of the age for

4

the Death sentence.

5

1984 lowered the age for transfer for violent crimes from 16 to

6

15, which in my view -- also in response to Justice Scalia's

7

question that, under the Federal Air Piracy Act, which was

8

mentioned by this Court in the McCleskey case, a fifteen-year-

9

old person, if he is properly transferred pursuant to the

As I previously mentioned, Congress in

certification transfer statutes, could receive the Death

Penalty if the procedure is adequate.
Therefore, the general public sentiment and the

objective factors that would justify the abolition of the Death

14

Penalty for young murderers is not present.

15

16

who reads the facts in many of these cases cannot help but

think that individual states and individual juries are

justified in imposing the Death sentence in those cases.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY HARRY F. TEPKER, JR., ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER — REBUTTAL

9

MR. TEPKER:

Thank you, Mr. Lee.

Thank you.

First, if I may focus on the deterrent question:

10

we

11

are talking about a risk of a Death sentence that is already

12

extremely low.

13

we have got individuals who are impulsive, who are not

14

necessarily calculating, sophisticated individuals.

15

in the deterrent effect when the risk is so small even with the

16

sophisticated and the calculating is difficult enough, but the

17

individuals of the nature who are being sentenced to death —

18
19

We are also talking about a situation in which

QUESTION:

To believe

Every person under 18 is not sophisticated

and calculating?

20

MR. TEPKER:

No, Your Honor, that is not what I meant

21

to say.

What I meant to say is they are part of a class who

22

share characteristics of immaturity and they are particularly

23

vulnerable to those personality characteristics.

24

trying to say is that even for the sophisticated individual,

25

the risk is not great.

Heritage

What I am

The deterrent effect even for them may

43
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

be extremely minimal.

2

For these individuals who are the ones receiving the

3

Death sentence, it is extremely difficult to believe that

4

deterrence plays any meaningful role in the kinds of thought

5

processes that led to these crimes.

6

Certification has been discussed and perhaps my

7

answers were garbled before, so I wanted to focus on that:

we

The certification process is designed to assess

10

the capacity for rehabilitation within the Oklahoma system, and

11

it refers as much to the Oklahoma system as it does to the

But more to the point, it does not focus on the

13
14

question of moral culpability for purposes of the Death

14

The question of rehabilitation has been raised.

We

15

do suggest that it is appropriate for the jury to make a

I would point out that the jury was asked by the prosecutor to

future.

indication that this question of rehabilitation was not brought

21

home to them as being of a primary importance or focus or

22

purposes of assessing the Death sentence.

23

With respect to Wayne Thompson,

And they refused to so-find.

That is a clear

Moreover, the State's description of the

24

rehabilitation efforts of Wayne Thompson, while accurate to a

25

degree, are somewhat exaggerated:

But there was never

Given that fact, I think it is fair to say that the

8

rehabilitative potential of Wayne Thompson is up in the air.

9

It is uncertain, and not at all clear that the jury did not

10

make the right decision when it refused to find a propensity

11

for future violence — in the future.
One last point:

12

counsel for the State has conceded

13

that there is a bottom somewhere.

14

going to make a careful assessment of where that bottom is, the

15

only concept that is meaningful in the law is the concept of

16

non-adulthood, to draw a line right in the middle of the class

17

of non-adults; right in the middle of the class who share these

18

characteristics of inexperience and immaturity; right in the

19

middle of this class of individuals who are so difficult to

20

judge at Age 15 or 13 or 14 -- makes no sense whatever.

21

adulthood, then, should be the concept.
