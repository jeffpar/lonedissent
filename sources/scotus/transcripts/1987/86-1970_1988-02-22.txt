ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. LEE:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The sole issue in this case was squarely decided two

11
12

terms ago by this Court's unanimous holding in Nantahala v.

13

Thornburgh that the Federal Power Act requires state and local

14

regulators, when the set retail electric rates, to include

15

within those rates wholesale power supply costs which the

16

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has determined to be just

17

and reasonable.
The Court left open the possibility of one narrow

18
19

exception which was inapplicable in Nantahala and, for reasons

20

that I will explain in just a moment, is clearly inapplicable

21

here.

22

At the center of the dispute is a nuclear power

23

plant, Grand Gulf I, which is owned by an integrated electric

24

system, Middle South Utilities, whose four wholly-owned public

25

utilities serve parts of four separate states.

Heritage

3
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

FERC found that the Grand Gulf plant was constructed

1
2

to meet the needs of the system as a whole, including the

3

diversification of its fuel sources, which, until the mid-

4

1970s, were limited to oil and gas.

5

unforeseen at the time Grand Gulf was originally planned, its

6

fixed costs, and therefore its total costs, were among the

7

highest on the Middle South system, even though its operating

8

expenses are the lowest.

13

long-range needs of its customers, any integrated system is

16

others.

17

In an

Moreover, the source that is the most expensive today

18

will not necessarily be the most expensive a few years from

19

now, depending on such variables as the world price of oil.
Each of the states served by such a system would, of

20
21

course, like to have for itself and its customers as much of

22

the system's low-cost power and as little of its high-cost

23

power as possible.

Someone has to decide who gets how much of

Fortunately, the Federal Power Act entitles the

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to allocate these widely

2

differing costs among the companies and the states involved;

3

and FERC's authority to make those allegations is not at issue

4

in this case.

5
6
7

For the purpose of this case, it is a given.

QUESTION:

Mr. Lee, I am anxious to ask you a

question or two about this case.
As I understand it, the Federal Power Act does not

8

grant FERC any jurisdiction over generating facilities.

9

is not possible to apply to FERC in the first instance to get

10

permission to build a nuclear generating facility.

11

MR. LEE:

12

QUESTION:

So it

Right?

That is correct.
And that application for a certificate of

13

convenience and necessity was made to the State of Mississippi,

14

which granted it.

15

MR. LEE:

16

QUESTION:

Again correct.
Now, what if a state refuses the

17

permission to build and yet the plant is built elsewhere and

18

under the system's agreement some allocation is made to a

19

Mississippi utility company that is part of the system, and

20

FERC says the rates are just and reasonable.

21

Does that mean that then the State of Mississippi has

22

to accept and allow that quantity of power to be sold in the

23

state at those FERC-approved rates?

24
25

MR. LEE:

In the context of an integrated system such

as this one is.

QUESTION:

2

MR. LEE:

Even if they had denied the permission?
That is correct.

The division of authority

3

is between the initial authorization to construct the plant, as

4

you have correctly stated, and the authorization to set the

5

wholesale rates for the power that comes from that plant once

6

it is constructed.

7

that it won't be built in Mississippi.

8

it won't be built in some other state.

9

allocations are clearly under the jurisdiction of the Federal

11

QUESTION:

It does not mean that
And the interstate

Is there any indication that FERC ever

12

decided that this allocation was prudent and that the

13

construction of the facility was prudent?

14

MR. LEE:

We believe, for reasons stated in our

15

brief, and for reasons stated in FERC's brief itself, that the

16

answer to that question is yes.
\

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. LEE:

That is correct.

It is susceptible of

19

either interpretation.

It is susceptible of either

20

interpretation.

believes that it decided the prudence issue.

22

important point is that, regardless of whether it was done or

23

not, the only entity that has the authority under the Federal

24

Power Act to deal with those contracts affecting wholesale

25

rates is FERC itself.

It is somewhat persuasive that FERC itself

So that if prudence is going to be

QUESTION:

day, as you apparently think it does.
MR. LEE:

5
6

I don't see that follows as the night the

Well, let me just give you two factors for

your consideration, Mr. Chief Justice.
The one is, that is exactly what happened in

7
8

Nantahala.

You had there not an integrated system of the type

9

that we have here, but you did have two wholly-owned

10

subsidiaries of a single company — Alcoa —■ and they had two

11

different sources — one lower cost and one higher cost.

12

the question was whether FERC's allocation of, in that case the

13

lower cost power, was binding on the North Carolina Utilities

14

Commission at the time that it set the retail rates for that

15

commission.

16

rates necessarily meant the power to make these allocations.

17

And

18

of the controversy here.

willing to accept that if this was a prudent investment, we are

20

stuck with 33 percent of it, or whatever the figure is.

21

As I understand it, the state was

You can acknowledge the FERC is entitled to allocate

22

without acknowledging that FERC is entitled to decide whether

23

the investment was prudent to begin with, can't you?

24

MR. LEE:

That brings us to the core legal question

25

that is raised by this case.

Heritage

And that is whether there

1

prudency determinations can be made by the states on a case-to-

2

case basis in the wake of a determination of an allocation by

3

FERC.
We submit, number one, that that issue was determined

4
5

by Nantahala, which did involve an allocation case, and number

6

two, that any other scheme permitting these allocations to be

7

redone by the states in the wake of an allocation that has

8

already been done by FERC would simply nullify the FERC

9

allocations that have already been made and make a shambles of

10

the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's function.

11

is particularly true in an

And that

integrated system such as this one.

The prudence issue is relevant only in those

12
13

instances where a utility has a choice to make, and then

14

chooses the more expensive alternative.

15

to FERC allocations of system capacity among the operating

16

subsidiaries of a public utility holding company, for this

17

reason.

18

But it is irrelevant

Mississippi Power & Light really has no alternative

19

to Grand Gulf power, because Mississippi Power & Light is part

20

of the Middle South system which planned and built Grand Gulf

21

to meet system needs as a whole.

22
23
24
25

The question is how that system's capacity, including
Grand Gulf, is to be allocated among the operating companies.
QUESTION:

The thing that is so basically

troublesome, though, is that under your view, admittedly the

FERC doesn't review that.

It is left to the

t

5

And yet, even if the states refuse to permit it to be

6

built, you say that a subsequent FERC determination about rates

7

precludes any review by the state as to the prudence of a new

8

facility when FERC itself doesn't review it.

9

nobody does.

10

MR. LEE:

Oh, no.

That just means

It doesn't mean nobody does.

It

11

means that if it is to be done, then the procedures which are

12

provided by the Federal Power Act which permit anyone,

13

including states, to participate and indeed to initiate those

14

proceedings, must do so before FERC.

15

Take the steps, Justice O'Connor, one at a time.

16

first is the authorization of the plant.

17

vested in the states.

18

The

And that one is

The second step, then, is the determination of just

19

and reasonable wholesale rates.

And Nantahala clearly held

20

that the allocation of sources among wholly-owned subsidiaries

21

is included within the setting of wholesale rates.

22

Now, once that allocation has been made, if the

23

individual states can then come along in the wake of that

24

determination and make their own allocation, then each state

25

will necessarily favor its own parochial interests and the

9

Heritage

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

careful plan of the Federal Power Act to vest those wholesale

2

rate determinations in one disinterested tribunal, the only

3

tribunal that does not have a constituency to serve will have

4

been frustrated.

5

And indeed, the very argument that Mississippi makes

6

in this case shows why it is that prudence determinations, that

7

the prudence issue simply is not an issue at all for anyone,

8

either state or Federal, in a case like this which involves an

9

integrated interstate system.

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Lee, you are really arguing for a very

11

drastic departure from the traditional method of regulating

12

utilities.

13

is based on its prudent investment — that has always been a

14

state matter before.

15

taken away from the states.

I mean, the return on the fair rate of the utility

16

MR. LEE:

17

QUESTION:

Now, you are saying all of that is simply

No.
I think you are.

If a state can't

18

determine the prudence of an investment, one of its main

19

controls over fixing utility rates is gone.

20

MR. LEE:

Well, prudence is simply not an issue in

21

the one narrow instance in which you have an integrated system

22

such as we have here, serving several different states in which

23

you have several different power sources, and all of those have

24

to be allocated among the separate states by-some governmental

25

entity.

And it has been done by FERC.

10

Heritage

This leaves for the state all of the traditional

2

regulatory authority that they always had with the exception of

3

one narrow function.

4

supply costs have been determined by FERC, then those

necessarily become costs for retail, the become part of the

QUESTION:

In most instances, they are.
Sure.

So it is a concern to know how

11

states can protect themselves from what they perceive today to

12

be a likely scenario of big cost overruns and concerns.

13

are the states going to protect themselves?

14

MR. LEE:

How

And the way they can protect themselves is

15

precisely by what Section 206 of the Federal Power Act says.

16

And that is to participate before FERC and to make an argument

17

before the only entity that has the authority to make that

18

determination.

19

20

years in the making.

QUESTION:

Mr. Lee, can I interrupt you?
Yes.
It seems to me that the question of

prudent, whether the wholesale rate is prudent, and there is

Did I understand you correctly to say that that is

a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the

Well, at the time that the original

That is correct.
And they did get a certificate from the

MR. LEE:

That is correct.
So do you contend that that decided the

portion of the prudence issue that relates to whether or not

25

there shall be a plant of this kind at all?

12

Heritage

628-4888

1

Well, it determines whether or not there

2

would be an authorization for the building of the plant.

Now,

they could still come back.

been determined that the allocation is prudent to give

MR. LEE:

That was exactly the issue that was before

24

this Court two terms ago in Nantahala when North Carolina

wanted to do just exactly that.

Heritage

And to say that even though

3
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

this has been determined to be a reasonable wholesale rate, we

2

are going to re-examine the prudence of the case at the state

3

level.
QUESTION:

4

I don't understand that.

Like Justice

5

Stevens, I see a lot of different prudence issues here.

One

6

issue is whether it is prudent to build this plant for the four

7

states.

8

answer of whether it was prudent for Mississippi to throw in

9

its lot with the other states.

The answer to that is not necessarily the same as the

That could be quite different.

10

It could make sense for the four states but make no sense at

11

all for Mississippi to go along with it.

12

could be milked by the consumers of the other three states.

13

Mississippi consumers

Now, can you tell me how the State of Mississippi can

14

protect its consumers against that? How can the State of

15

Mississippi say we don't want to go into this regional thing in

16

the first place?

17

Where is that prudence issue determined?

MR. LEE:

If the State of Mississippi says that it

18

doesn't want to go into it in the first place, it can of course

19

turn down the plant.

20

another state or it may not.

21

That means that it may be built in

It can also make the same prudence arguments that it

22

made during the course of a three-year long proceeding before

23

the FERC and make its argument there.

24
25

QUESTION:
another state?

What if the plant is being built in

It can't protect itself by denying approval for

14

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

the building of the plant, can it?
MR. LEE:

2

That is correct.

But what it can do is to

3

protect its interests by arguing before the only entity that

4

has authority over the wholesale rates that come out of that

5

plant.
QUESTION:

6

But FERC's interest is in the whole four-

7

state region.

It's not in Mississippi alone.

Who protects

8

Mississippi's narrow, selfish interest?

9

four states, and FERC is going to say it makes a lot of sense.

It makes sense for the

10

Mississippi says it does, but it doesn't make sense for our

11

people.
MR. LEE:

12

Well, there is no more reason to assume

13

that that issue can be decided any better by a court than it

14

can by an administrative agency.

15

16

jurisdictions and not just one.

Certainly that is the only

FOR AMICI CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF APPELLANT
MR. COHEN:

22
23
24
25

We

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
Let me begin with Justice O'Connor's question.

The

State of Mississippi had the power to decide whether or not to

15

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

628-4888

v

1

license a plant located within Mississippi.

And there are

2

various things on which it could condition that license.

3

the one thing that it could not, and by the say, the State of

4

Mississippi did not attempt to impose as a condition on that

5

license, is that the power that is produced by that plant be

6

sold at wholesale in interstate commerce on terms other than

7

the terms filed with FERC.

8

by Grand Gulf I is sold at wholesale in interstate commerce,

9

and the terms for that sale can be determined only by FERC.

But

All of the power that is produced

The question whether the wholesaler, MSE, should be

10
11

permitted to charge the full price, its full costs for

12

producing that power, or should be denied some of that return

13

on the ground that the investment was, in whole or in part,

14

imprudent, that question is a question that can only be decided

15

by FERC because -QUESTION:

16

Mr. Cohen, I thought Mr. Lee, in response

17

to Justice O'Connor's question, said it could be reasonably

18

argued either way whether FERC had decided this question or

19

not.

20

MR. COHEN:

I think that FERC has decided it only in

21

the sense that the issue was not raised and some parts of the

22

issue have probably been decided by the failure of the state

23

which participated in the FERC proceeding to raise the issue.

24

There may be other parts that remain open.

25

QUESTION:

You say then that FERC may have quote,

16

Heritage

Corporation

628-4888

1

"decided" close quote, as you would use that term, it, simply

2

by doing nothing when nothing was presented to it on the

3

question?
MR. COHEN:

4

We are talking about a potential

5

challenge to a wholesale rate charged by a wholesaler for

6

transactions in interstate commerce.
I think that the question whether and to what extent

7
8

FERC has decided prudence issues relating to that rate ought to

9

be left for FERC itself to decide if the State of Mississippi

10

or others now want to go back to FERC and argue that the whole

11

thing was imprudent or they put solid gold doorknobs on it and

12

that was an imprudent investment -- if somebody wants to go

13

back to FERC and argue —

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. COHEN:

Is that presently open, in FERC's view?
The question that I am explicitly

16

declining to answer is the extent to which such challenges are

17

precluded.

18

is engaged in a continuous audit of the operation of this

19

plant.

20

that the charges for the power that is produced by this plant

21

to the local utility are unjust and unreasonable because

22

expenses were not prudently incurred, and FERC decides that.

23

Certainly some challenges are open.

Indeed, FERC

And the state can, under Section 206, go to FERC, argue

The present point is only that FERC's jurisdiction to

24

decide the prudence of facilities, all of whose power is sold

25

In wholesale and interstate commerce, must be exclusive.

1

Mr. Cohen, explain to me how the Federal

6

MR. COHEN:

QUESTION:

I don't think it is an end run.
Well, why isn't it?

Because FERC can't

decide in the first instance whether a nuclear generating plant

should be built.

That goes to the states.

MR. COHEN:

But it can -- no, it cannot; insist that

the plant be built if the state wants to say no.

decide that a utility system that has built a plant will not be

Mississippi did what it should.

It argued to FERC

12

that Grand Gulf should be treated as added to the existing

sources of power in such a way that each company would first

14

get credit for its older, cheaper sources of power, and the

15

companies that are then short, the companies that say we don't

16

need this power because we've got plenty, should pay for Grand

17

Gulf.

18

FERC explicitly concluded that that would be unjust

19

and instead that the way that the system operated, the fact

20

that the nuclear capacity supplies the baseload and was

21

invested in on that basis, made it appropriate for the four

22

companies first to share the nuclear capacity in proportions

23

specified by FERC and that the companies that are then long

after they have bought their share of the nuclear power, should

sell the older, cheaper power to the other companies in the

a third of the costs of Grand Gulf I on Mississippi -- or 33

MR. MAXEY:

Court:
The Appellant invites the Court to take action the

result of which will be the transfer of a substantial amount of

Federal Government.

The State of Mississippi and the Mississippi Legal
Services Coalition submit that such a result would be contrary
to this Court's prior decisions, to the enactment of
legislation by Congress —■ the Federal Power Act -- and to
important policies of this Nation.
The Appellant has raised the significant issues on a
record that is far from complete.

If Mississippi is permitted

to complete its regulatory responsibilities, we submit that
there will be no cause for this Court to take the extreme step
urged by the Appellant.
After describing several essential facts which the
Appellant failed to describe, we would like to summarize that
part which Mississippi plays in the dual regulatory system
contemplated by this Court and the legislation.
MP&L wears three hats in these proceedings.

It is

And it is the construction manager of Grand Gulf.
Let me address the latter first.

In the early 1970s

the operating companies of the Middle South Utilities System
decided to make a large investment in Grand Gulf, a huge
nuclear generating facility.
They did this to produce electricity for their
customers, but to also produce a large return on their
investment for their stockholders.

Could Mississippi have stopped that?

neighboring state granted it, so the facility was purchased,

15

MR. MAXEY:

Your Honor, the question raises the

conflict between the FERC jurisdiction to rule on these kind of

itself through prudence inquiries when those rates come to

Mississippi as retail rates.

That is correct.
So they are going to have to do that no

Heritage

1

matter what.

2

MR. MAXEY:

3

QUESTION:

That is correct.
And you say Mississippi can now make a

4

determination that they can pay for it but none of that cost

5

can be recouped?
MR. MAXEYs

6

That is correct.

Our position is that

7

the shareholders, I mean the rate payers should not be required

8

to pay for the imprudence of the management of a company in its

9

undertakings to sell retail power to the ultimate consumer.

10

This is based on the fact that when MP&L decided to construct

11

this unit, it made representations to the Mississippi Public

12

Service Commission in order to get its license, and it did so,

13

in acknowledging the jurisdiction of Mississippi to grant or

14

reject that license.
It said, for example, that the cost of this two-unit

15
16

plant was going to be $1.4 billion when completed, and the

17

first unit would be completed in 1979 and the second in 1981.

18

It also represented that the specific methodology that would be

19

used to allocate both the costs and the electricity to the

20

customers was that which was going to be put in place before

21

the FERC.

22

It also made representations that the retail rate

23

payers at that time in Mississippi really had no need for the

24

electricity to be produced by Grand Gulf but it would be

25

valuable in the future and it would accrue to the benefit of

Heritage

25
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

the rate payers of Mississippi to support the construction of

2

this plant, but they wouldn't have to pay for it until they

3

needed it and they wouldn't have to take the power until they

4

needed it.
MP&L continued to serve as construction manager,

5
6

supervising all phases of the design and construction of the

7

facility.

8

skyrocketed to some 400 percent of the original estimations so

9

that the completion of Unit I alone was some $3.6 billion.

We now know that the cost of that facility

The demand for electricity began to decline during

10
11

this period shortly after construction began, and the cost

12

escalated, so that MP&L and its sister subsidiaries came

13

together and arrived at a different methodology.
The plan was adopted by the MSU companies in 1908,

14
15

but it wasn't presented to the Mississippi Public Service

16

Commission until 1981 and then it was revealed only through

17

cross examination of one of the company officials who was there

18

testifying about the acquisition of substantial capacity other

19

than Grand Gulf, a coal-fired plant in Arkansas called

20

Independence.
QUESTION:

21

What action, if any, did the Mississippi

22

Corporation Commission take in 1981 when it found out about

23

this?

24
25

MR. MAXEY:

It took no action then.

In 1983, it

reviewed that situation and found that the representations had

26
Reporting Corporation

1

been made and entered an order making a finding that the

2

changes had taken place without any permission being given by

3

the Mississippi Public Service Commission.

4

any action at that time.

5

But it did not take

The President of MP&L represented to the Commission

6

in 1981 that irrespective of the changes that had been made by

7

the operating companies with regard to this agreement and the

8

allocation of the cost and electricity from Grand Gulf,

9

the Public Service Commission of Mississippi still had the

that

10

authority, it had the ultimate authority, when MP&L decided to

11

put these rates into the retail rate structure.

12

Of course, we've heard how the ultimate '82 agreement

13

and the allocation agreement were submitted to the FERC for

14

approval and after being modified Mississippi ended up with 33

15

percent instead of the 31.63 percent that MP&L had agreed to do

16

in this agreement subsequent to the certification of the unit.

17

MP&L then, of course, came to the Mississippi Public

18

Commission to obtain the rates at retail to pay them for the 33

19

percent allocation of Grand Gulf.

20

Prudence of MP&L's actions with regard to its

21

acquisition of such a large percentage of Grand Gulf was

22

acknowledged as an issue in the case.

When that was appealed to the Mississippi Supreme

And what the Mississippi Supreme Court

around, and it is a bit elusive.

submit that a fair definition would be what was the quality of

the exclusive right to provide adequate electrical service to

its retail customers at a price both fair and reasonable to

those customers and to give it the opportunity to earn a

the proceedings before the FERC, and the question was are the

MR. MAXEY:

QUESTION:

MR. MAXEY:

Yes, Ma'am, absolutely.
Clearly, the quantity issue was litigated.
Yes.
Along with price and costs.
The principal issue was what allocation

6

was coming to each state.

7

it was, Your Honor.

8

QUESTION:

9
10

That was one of the debates.

Yes,

So the question is whether the state now

has to take the quantity that FERC said it would have to take,
and that was litigated?
MR. MAXEY:

11

Well, it was litigated in the sense that

12

each state was trying to get an allocation that was most

13

suitable to them at the time or at least I think each state was

14

trying to get the least amount it could take so as to avoid the

15

high cost that would ultimately be passed on if all of it were

16

passed on.
QUESTION:

17

Now, if it were lower cost power being

18

distributed, and that had been litigated before FERC, and this

19

was the lowest cost power that was available, I guess you agree

that Nantahala would preclude you from now saying the state can

you?

set of facts.

13

there was only one source of power flowing to Nantahala and

14

when the ratio went from lower cost power, more than the

i5

entitlement, then it raised the cost in the other state, and if

16

that were modified as it were by the North Carolina Utilities

Commission, and they took more of the lower cost entitlement

18

power from that one source, then it raised the cost in

Tennessee.

The facts were, as the Opinion reflected, that

So there was a seesaw effect.
We contend here that there is present both before

MR. MAXEY:

No, sir.

Mississippi takes the position

15

that it really doesn't know what it is going to find in the way

16

of prudence when it conducts the prudency inquiry.

QUESTION:

Theoretically, then, I suppose you could

find that failure to make a proper readjustment, after Three-

19

Mile Island and so forth and so on, that there is a certain

20

portion of the costs that is imprudent and therefore that the

rate base for retail purposes would be different than the rate

Yes, sir.

ability to meet that payment that it is obligated to make to

the Mississippi Regulatory Commission would be?

MR. MAXEY:

Your Honor, I don't think that there is

any rule of law that would have kept Mississippi from making

14

believe it's the Union Electric case, that where the state had

conducted a prudence inquiry at the state level about the

16

retail rates, and then carried its findings to the FERC and

17

said we found imprudence here, and we would like to have, like

18

to be able to have you recognize the imprudence at the FERC

19

level.

20

In fact, an example of sort of the dual regulatory system

The FERC said we have the right to conduct a prudency

21

inquiry and we may take into consideration what the state has

22

found but we're not bound by it, I think, thereby recognizing

the dual regulatory system that is contemplated by the Federal

We consider that the Federal Power Act was adopted to

provide the regulation of interstate wholesale sales of

To those that argue that this interferes with the

this Court has admonished that the courts should not assume a

Mr.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE, ESQ.

4

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT - REBUTTAL
MR. LEE;

5

First, I would like to just clarify that

6

every single one of these prudence issues could be raised

7

before FERC, and also, that FERC can and does reject increases

8

in the wholesale rate base on the basis that the costs are

9

imprudently acquired.
Footnote 15 of our reply brief discusses the cases in

10

11

which that happens.
FERC did not consider these issues, or said they did

12

13

not consider them -- we think they did -- but in any event, the

14

ALJ said that he wasn't going to consider anything that was not

15

raised.

16

The crucial point is that these matters can and must

17

be raised before FERC if they are to be raised at all, and the

18

reason lies right at the heart of why the Federal Power Act was

19

enacted.

20

It was enacted in order to preclude violations of the

21

Commerce Clause that would otherwise occur.

It is very

22

apparent that the alternatives to the use of Grand Gulf Power

23

to which the

24

otherwise, of the other sources within the Middle South System,

25

oil and gas, which are cheaper, which are located right within

Mississippi Attorney General refers is the use of

42
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

Mississippi and which, if Grand Gulf has not used, will then be

2

sent out of state to other parts of the Middle South system.

3

That is the NEPCO case, and NEPCO squarely declares that this

4

would be a violation of the Commerce Clause.

5

we have a Federal Power Act, because we are one Nation and we

6

need one entity that can prevent these violations of the

7

Commerce Clause that would otherwise occur.

8

9

And that is why

The fact of the matter is that FERC has made a
determination that it is just and reasonable for Mississippi to

10

bear 33 percent of the costs of Grand Gulf.

11

here is nothing less than an attempt to have the states test

12

the prudence of the costs that FERC has ordered that

13

Mississippi bear.

Thank you.
