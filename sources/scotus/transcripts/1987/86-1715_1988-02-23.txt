ORAL ARGUMENT OF RUTH E. PETERS, ESO.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MS. PETERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

10

the Court, this case arises under Title 7 of the Civil Service

11

Reform Act of 1978, the statutory scheme for labor-management

12

relations in the federal sector.

13

principle that is as basic to labor relations in the federal

14

sector as it is in the private sector, namely, an employer's

IS

obligation to bargain over negotiable matters before making

16

changes in the working conditions of employees.

17

The case involves a

The case also involves the relationship between

18

Section 7117 of Title VII, which describes the substantive

19

scope of bargaining in the federal sector and establishes

20

administrative procedures for resolving scone of baraainina

21

or negotiability issues, and the statutory unfair labor

22

practice provisions which make it an unfair Labor practice

23

for a federal employer to refuse to bargain in aood. faith

24

and also establish procedures for adjudicatincr unfair labor

25

practice cases.

In this case, when respondent Aberdeen Proving

1

2

Ground announced that it would curtail operations the dav

3

after Thanksgiving and that employees would be placed on

4

forced annual leave for that day, the exclusive representative

5

of Aberdeen's employees proposed that the employees instead

6

be granted administrative leave for that day.

7

refused to bargain on the union's proposals, stating that

8

agency regulations precluded a grant of administrative leave

9

in those circumstances.

10

Aberdeen

In the unfair labor practice case that ensued,’ the

11

Authority reexamined and reaffirmed its previous holdings

12

that the authority is empowered to resolve in a unilateral

defense that bargaining is barred by an agency regulation for

16

The Authority'-s consistent holdings on this point

17

are, we submit, faithful to the text and the purposes of the

18

Authority's enabling Act, consistent with the Authority's

19

undisputed ability to resolve other negotiability differences

20

in unilateral change unfair labor practice cases,

21

with the practice under the executive order program that pre­

22

dated Title VII, and constitute an appropriate harmonizing of

23

the negotiability and unfair labor practice provisions of

24

Title VII.

available to an employer may only be resolved in the appeal

3

procedures established in Section 7117, and indeed that the

4

employer's obligation to bargain is not even triggered until

5

the Authority resolves the compelling need issue in the

6

negotiability appeal forum.
Aberdeen's proffered view of Section 7117 cannot be

7
8

squared with the structure, the purposes, and the history of

9

that provision and would not give effect to the unfair labor

10

practice provisions of the statute.

11

Congress's

12

copelling need for an agencv regulation should be permitted

13

to disrupt the bargaining obligation in unilateral change

14

cases when Congress also intended that agency reflations be

15

one of the statute's least restrictive bars to bargaining.

It is incorrect to view

enabling Act, we submit, should be upheld.

18

issues in this case it is helpful to review very briefly

the scope of bargaining in the federal sector.

21

22

obligation.

To examine the

A federal

23

However, the statutory terms governing federal

24

sector bargaining, besides defining the scope of matters

25

included in the bargaining obligation, also enumerate several
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 62S-4M0

5

i

matters that are excluded from the scope of the duty to

2

baraain.

3

provides that the duty to baraain does not encompass

4

proposals that would bring about an inconsistency with federal

5

law or aovernment-wide regulation.

6

to bargain are proposals that would, improperly intrude on

7

the exercise of the management rights listed in Section 7106,

8

and the statute in Section 7117(c) establishes a negotiability

9

appeal procedure for resolvinq those kinds of scope of

10

bargaining questions.

For example, Section 7117(a)(1) of the statute

Also excluded from the duty

The statute in Section 7117(aO(2) also excludes

11
12

from the bargaining obligation proposals which would bring

13

about an inconsistency only with those regulations for which

14

there is a compelling need, and Section 7117(b) establishes

15

an anneal procedure for resolving this type of negotiability

16

issue.

17

The Authority's regulations implementing Section

18

7117 nrovide that when an employer agency refuses to baraain

19

over a union's proposal during ongoing negotiations

20

because the proposal is alleged to be outside the scope of

21

the duty to bargain, and when no unilateral change or con­

22

templated chances in conditions of employment are involved,

23

then the negotiability issues are to be resolved through the

24

negotiability appeal procedure set forth in Section 7117.

25

QUESTION:

Ms. Deters, this case arose out of one

Heritage Reporting Corporation

day's work, the decision of the respondent to close down

2

on the day after Thanksgiving in 1981?

3

MS. PETERS:

4

QUESTION:

5
6

Yes.
And the union still wants to baraain

over that?
MS. PETERS:

There has been no compliance that we

7

know of, and certainly even if the baraaining had taken

8

olace there is at least a notice posting remedy as well and

9

the employer here continues to resist the notion that an

10

unfair labor nractice would be apprpropriate —

11
12

13

QUESTION:

So if vou win, then there will be some

kind of bargaining about that one day in 1981 presumably?
MS. PETERS:

If we prevail, the merits of the

14

compellinor need, fhb Authority's compelling need determination

15

that there is no compelling need for the agency regulation

16

have not vet been resolved.

Authority's order in all respects.

While I have vou interrupted, is there

21

some legislative history that indicates that Conqress

22

considered and reiected the very position that you are takina

23

today on behalf of the Authority?

24
25

MS. ^ETERS:

No, there is not.

One of the bills

that led to the enactment of the statute was the House bill
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 620-4MS

7

1

reported out of the House Committee.

That bill, although it

2

referred to a compelling need determination, would have for

3

the first time in a rather fundamental fashion broadened the

4

scope of bargaining beyond what had existed under the

5

executive order by permitting bargaining in an area in which

6

an employer did not ordinarily have administrative discretion,

7

that is, matters covered by government-wide regulation, unless

8

there were a compelling need for the government-wide regulation
And also the House report accompanying that bill

9
10

indicated that other types of scope of baraaining issues

H

other than these aovernment-wide regulation issues would

12

always be decided in unfair labor practice cases.

13

that provision was rejected, did not make its way into lav/.

14

Instead, what we have here is a system that is fairly much

IS

analogous to the executive order program.

16

basic contours of the scope of bargaining are pretty much

17

the same.

18

that are inconsistent v/ith federal law or government-wide

19

regulation or with agency reaulations, but only to the extent

20

that a compelling need exists for the agency regulation.

21

also there is a statutory management riaht —

MS. 'PETERS:

I think we can be assured that they

will have the onoorturiity if they wish. They may not always

be a party, but the Authority's regulations would permit

someone to take part in an unfair labor nractice.

neqotiabilitv and the unfair labor practice provisions.

24

Precisely why Congress first made hearings discretionary but

25

then also required that agencies be involved if there were a
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 62MMS

11

I

hearing is really not clear.

As we suggested in our brief

2

and petition, perhaps it would be to provide the aaencv one

3

more chance to waive the issue of compelling need before the

4

resources were expended upon going forward with a hearina on

5

the matter, but we would note that in the absense of a hearina,

6

and to my knowledge there hasn't been a hearing on compelling

7

need issues, there is no regruiement that the aaencv be —

8

participate in the neaotiability appeal procedure.
The Authority's determination that it is'empowered

9
10

to resolve an emplover's compelling need negotiability

11

defense in a unilateral change case draws support first of

12

all from Section 7117.

13

structure of Section 7117 that these provisions have as their

14

object purpose to describe the substantive scope of the

IS

bargaining obligation and to provide procedures for resolving

16

neaotiabilitv issues, and this purpose is as apparent in the

17

compelling need provisions as in the other parts of Section

18

7117.

19

It is apparent from the text and

The Authcritv gives effect to these provisions by

20

construing Section 7117 as providing the appropriate forum

21

for resolving negotiabilitv issues that emanate from onuoing

22

collective bargaining negotiations when no unilateral change

23

issues are involved, but given the purpose of the provisions,

24

to describe and determine the extent of the bargaining

25

obligation, it seems difficult indeed, to view any word or
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 62S-4M9

12

i

part of these provisions as establishing a condition precedent

2

for the duty to barcrain or as defining when the duty to bargain

3

arises, and any attempt to-read the terms of Section 7117 as

4

precluding the resolution of compelling need issues in

5

unilateral change cases must begin with the acknowledgement

6

that not a sinale word in Section 7117 explicitly addresses

7

the relationship between that section and the unfair labor

8

practice provisions of the statute.

9

As the D.C. Circuit recently noted in NLPRU versus

10

FLRA, cited in our reply brief, the relationship between the

11

statute's negotiability provisions and its unfair labor

12

practice procedures is profoundly ambiguous.

13

the Authority's construction of the statutory terms to give

14

effect to both the negotiability and the unfair labor practice

IS

provisions surely must pass a test of reasonableness.

16

In this context

The Authority's construction of the statute draws

17

further support from the historical development of the

18

compelling need test, which was introduced during the

19

executive order era in order to broaden the scope of baraaininc

20

and to limit the availability of agency regulations as a

21

bar to bargaining, and indeed, given the stringent criteria

22

developed by the authority, like its executive order pre-

23

decssor for evaluating compelling need, and given that the

24

employer bears the burden of demonstrating the existence

25

of a compelling need, agency regulations serve as one of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 620-40M

13

1

least restrictive bars to baraaining. In this context, it would

2

seem inconaruous to view Congress as intending that compelling

3

need determinations serve as a condition precedent to the

4

triggering of the baraaining obligation or to view compelling

5

need determinations as the sole negotiabillity defense that

6

mav not be resolved in a unilateral change unfair labor

7

practice case.

8

In addition, the Authority's practice of resolving

9

negotiability defenses, including compelling need defenses

10

in a unilateral chanae unfair labor practice case derives

11

support from consideration of important public policies.

12

First, the effective administration of the statute is fostered ;

13

when all the issues, including all the employer's neaotia-

14

bility defenses, can be resolved in one proceeding.

15

The dispute resolution process is streamlined in

16

the Congressional purpose of facilitating and promoting

17

collective bargaining is served.

18

the D.C. Circuit in upholding the Authority's view in

19

Defense Logistics Agency considered the second point perhaps

QUESTION:

4

MS. PETERS:

S

QUESTION:

Ms. Peters -Yes.
As I understand the government's

6

contention is that Section 7117(a)(2), which is reproduced

7

on 3A of your petition for writ of certiorari, when it says

8

that the duty to bargain extends only if the authority is

9

determined under Subsection (b) of this section that no

10

compelling need exists, that that is the only wav that a

11

compelling need determination may be made that will influence

12

the bargaining — now, what is your response in terms of

13

just specific statutory provisions to that?

14

MS. PETERS:

Yes.

Well, as we indicated earlier,

15

the purpose of Section 7117 is to describe the scope of

16

bargaining, not when bargaining arises, and so any of the

17

particular words or phrases must be read in that context.

18

QUESTION:

19

MS. PETERS:

Even if it says "only if?"
Well, only says only, but it seems to

20

me it is only referring to the substantive evaluation of

21

whether there is a compelling need.

23

QUESTION:

Their using that word

It doesn't say only if there is a

24

compelling, it says only if the Authority is determined under

25

Subsection (b) of this section that no comoelling need

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4000

5

1

exists.
MS. PETERS:

2

Well, it seems to me that if that

3

word were the governing word in Section 7117, that it would

4

lead to results even beyond those described here, for

5

example.
QUESTION: : But the word "only" is not ordinarily an

6

7

ambiguous word.

If it says this shall be done only in this

8

way, it means only that and not otherwise.

9

really swallow that here, don't you?
MS. PETERS:

10

And you have to

Well, I think it must be read in

11

context.

It cannot be taken out of Section 7117 in its

12

entirety, and it seems to me that that provision, placing the

3

emphasis on that word, for example, could lead one to the

4

conclusion that, for example, when an aaency makes alternative

5

arguments about a single bargaining proposal alleging both

6

Section 7117(b) defenses and Section 7117(c) defenses, that

7

the Authority would have to hold two proceedings there.

8
9

But of course the Authority has always, and has nevei
been subject to challenge so far as I know, conducted unified

20

proceedings addressing all negotiability issues in one pro­

21

ceeding, and it would also seem to suggest perhaps that

22

every agency regulation out there that touches on conditions

23

of employment would have to somehow walk through the

24

■JsUthority' s door before bargaining could begin, and for

25

example -- and there is certainly no thought of that so far as
Heritage Reporting Corporation

I

I know in the federal sector program»

2

Circuit's first decision, the Fort Belvoir decision, arose

3

when the subordinate level in the union requested a waiver

4

of the higher level agency and the waiver was denied, but

5

certainly it describes a fact pattern where parties felt free

6

to seem a waiver on an agency reaulation rather than croing to

7

the Authority.

8

that proceedinq could decide a compelling need issue.

9

In fact, the Fourth

The Authority said that only it and only in

So it seems to me that first of all there is no

10

plain language that would assist us, unfortunately, in the

11

construction of these statutory terms, and that even if they

12

were, they could not be read as overriding the purposes of the

13

statute as a whole.

14

Finally, I would just want to note that there are no

15

drawbacks resulting from the Authority's practice of resolving

16

compellinq need issues in unilateral change cases.

17

suggestion that a determination of compelling need issues in

18

the unfair labor practice forum somehow restricts the Aaency

19

abilitv to regulate its affairs is simply without basis.

20

Aberdeen's

The Authority's case law makes clear that an

21

22

from disseminating these regulations to subordinate ^levels

25

the bargaining unit, unless the employer

on the employer is the statutory one to bargain before

3

implementation of the agency regulation as to the bargaining

4

unit.

S

And the only requirement

Further, if a compelling need is found the employer

6

will not be required to bargain over inconsistent proposals

7

and even if there is no compelling need found and the Authority

8

orders that the change be rescinded, such a remedy would

9

only deprive the employer of the results of a unilateral

10

change that it should have not made in the first place without

11

bargaining.

12

I

In short, as the D.C. Circuit opined in Defense

13

Logistics Agency, the Authority has good reasons for its

14

construction of its enabling statute, reasons that are firmly

IS

rooted in the terms and the history and the purposes of the

16

statute, and that give effect to both the negotiability and

17

the unfair labor practice provisions in this enactment.

I

18

wrong path at the outset. Correctly viewed, this case does

not require the Court to seek out private labor law analocrs

or delve into pre-Act legislative history or balance free-

6

floating notions of efficiency or general public policy.

7

The Authority has reached an

This is instead a case about the plain meaning of

8

a statute that speaks directly to the auestion presented and

9

answers, arid the answer that the statute provides is this. A

10

proceeding under Section 7117(b) is the only means by which

11

to challenae the compelling need for an agency-wide reaulation

12

when such a regulation is asserted as a bar to federal sector

13

collective bargaining.

14

I would like to begin with the statute iteslf. Siaht

IS

up front, Section 7117(a)(2) states that the dutv to bargain

16

in good faith shall extend to matters that are the subject of

17

agency-wide regulations only if the Authority has determined

18

under Subsection (b) there is no compelling need for the

19

regulation at issue.

20

These words are not silent, nor are they, as the

21

Authority suggests in its reply brief, merely the starting

22

point for analysis.

23

compelling need issue does the duty to bargain in good

Belvoir decision, is a "highly singular" word.

2

suggest that there are lots of other ways to do the same thing,

3

and as we read the statute and as we read its plain language,

4

unless and until that compelling need determination has been

5

made there is simply no duty to bargain at all with respect

6

to matters covered by the regulations, and thus the Authority's

7

assertion throughout its brief that there is this thing called

8

a continuing duty to bargain is misplaced in this context

9

because the bargaining duty cannot continue unless and until

10

it first arises, and it doesn't arise under the statute until

11

the compelling need determination has been made, and not just

12

made in any way the Authority sees fit to make it.

It doesn't

It says guite explicitly it must be made under Sub­
section (b) , not in the ULP forum, not in any -other forum,
under Subsection (b), and unti? that determination has been
made, the ULP process simply cannot get under way.
We believe the lanauage is plain, and that its

8

purpose is evident and guite sensible,

for the ULP process

9

is manifestly inappropriate for resolving disputes concerning

20

the compelling need for agencv-wide recrulaiions, and the facts

21

of this case illustrate my point.

22

Here a federal agency, the Department of Defense

23

and its primary national subdivision, the Department of the

24

Army, promulgated regulations governing anticipated closures

25

at agency facilities. The machinists and aerospace workers
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) *2«~4M0

20

1

contended that those recralations lacked a compellina need.

2

When it made that claim, it asserted in effect two propositions

3

first, that the Army and the Defense Department could not apply

4

the regulations, their requlations in a particular case that

5

they plainly intended to cover, and second, that the local

6

employer, here Aberdeen Proving Grounds, may not follow a

7

regulation that its parent agency explicitly directed it to

8

obev.

9

A union asserts both such propositions every time

10

it asserts that an agency-wide regulation lacks a compelling

11

need, and in our judgment that tells us two things about what

12

an ideal system ought to look like for resolving compelling

13

need.

14

that issued the regulation a chance to be heard on the question

15

whether its regulation has a compelling iustification and

16

deserves to be applied according to its terms.

17

just be a fortuity.

It shouldn't just be up to the agency

18

if it feels like it.

It should be right in the statute and

19

be required.

First, the ideal svstem ought to entitle the agencv

20

It shouldn't

And second, the svstem, the ideal svstem should not

21

saddle the local employer with an unfair labor practice simply

22

because it obeyed a regulation that its parent acrency directed

23

it to follow, and in our view that is just exactly the system

24

that Congress enacted.

25

there is no duty to bargain unless and until the Authority has

'«/V.

First, Section 7117(a)(2) says that
S'

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 62S-4Mf

21

1

made a compelling need determination under Subsection (b)

2

and that is just another way of saying that the local

3

employer cannot be charged with the ULr> simply because it

4

has followed its parent's regulations.

5

creates a procedure that entitles the issuing agency to be

6

heard on the question whether its regulation passes the

7

compelling need test.

Second, Section 7117(b)

8

Under Subsection (b)(3) a hearing may be heard at

9

which the issuing agency is a necessary party, at which the

10

general counsel who is the prosecutor in the ULP forum is not

11

entitled to be present, and in which the only issue to be

12

determined is the question of compelling need.

13

Now, earlier during the argument I believe Justice

14

O'Connor put a question to Ms. Peters concerning whether there

IS

is any relevant legislative history.

16

and it is not just leaislative history of the sort that is a

17

filigree on the plain meaning of the statute, but it was

18

Conqress's explicit answer to the auestion presented in this

19

case.

20

We believe'there is,

Now, to be sure, as Ms. Peters notes, correctly, the

21

answer was given in the context of a predecessor statute, one

22

in which the compelling need’ language was used with respect

23

to government-wide regulations and not agency-wide regulations,

24

but the statutory language with respect to compelling need was

25

identical.

It was the same exact substantive test, the
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 62S-4MC

22

1

compelling need procedures were identical, and the House took

2

up the question whether the ULP forum would be available to

3

resolve the compelling need questions for government-wide

4

regulations, and this is the answer thev qave:

5

"The Committee intends that disputes concerning the

6

negotiability of proposals and matters affecting working

7

conditions except for questions of compelling need under

8

Section 7117 be resolved through the filing and processing of

9

unfair labor practice charges under Section 7116 and 7118."

10

That is the answer to the question presented in this

11

case.

12

didn't enact the version of Section 7117 that was in the House

13

bill.

14

even more relevant given what they did subsequently, because

IS

the scope of the bargaininq obligation got smaller after the

16

House bill was put in.

Now, that answer doesn't

qo

away simply because Conaress

Indeed, there is good reason to think the answer is

17

The government-wide regulations became a complete

18

bar to qe<rotiations', and agency-wide reaulations , which had

19

previously not been a bar at all under the prior bill, became

20

a bar to the extent they were justified by compelling need.

21

So the fact, it seems to me, that the prior bill didn't

22

become law doesn't argue for overlooking the meaning that the

23

— or in this case the House of Representatives imposed on the

24

identical language that confronts the Court this morning.

25

Let me say also with respect to the 7117(c) araument

that has been made, the Authority takes the view, and has taken

2

the view this morning that because under Section 7117(c) there

Indeed, in our view the

For unlike Section 7117(b) which states that the

11

Authority shall determine compelling need in any collective

12

bargaining dispute in which it arises, Section 7117(c) provides

13

that if with respect to any other negotiability dispute an

14

agency alleges that there is no duty to bargain in good faith,

15

the union may appeal under the expedited negotiability pro­

16

cedures detailed in the balance of Section 7117(c).

17

There is no language in Section (c) that is

18

comparable to that in Section (b), nothing that is — that

19

commands the Authority that it shall determine negotiability

20

when a compelling need issue is the bar that is asserted

21

by the agency, and nor for that matter does Section 7117(c)

22

state as (a)(2) does that the duty to bargain in good faith

23

does not arise at all unless and .until the Authority has

determined the negotiability issue in the expedited compelling

9

that Conqress didn't simply back into the plain language of

10

the statute, but chose and chose deliberately.

11

We believe that contrast is

The fact that Conqress carved out one tvpe of

And as I suggested before, it chose wisely, because

12

compelling need determinations for agency-wide regulations are

13

an unusual and unique type of dispute which deserves and ouaht

14

to be resolved in a special expedited forum in which the

IS

issuing agency has the right, the statutory right to be

16

present.

17

Let me say a brief word about the argument the

18

Authority makes with respect to the executive order practice.

19

This argument, as I understand it, suggests that because there

20

existed} under the executive order reqime a riaht in the

21

Assistant Secretary of Labor to decide all negotiability

22

issues, that that same power must reside in an ALJ to decide

23

compelling need questions in the ULP forum.

24
25

That arqument, we believe, is wroncr for two reasons.
First, it misstates the historical record.
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628*4098

It is true, to be

25

1

sure, that Executive Order 11838 gave the Assistant Secretary

2

the newer to decide negotiability issues that had previously

3

arisen during disputes but which had theretofore been outside

4

his jurisdiction.

5

that that power also entitled him to decide compelling need

6

questions in particular.

7

But there is no reason at all to believe

Quite the contrary is the case.

For at the same

8

time that Executive Order 11838 empowered the Assistant

9

Secretary to decide negotiability questions in qeneral, it

10

also created a separate and distinct and quite detailed

11

proce^’i.re for resolving the compelling need for angecy-wide

12

regulations in particular.

13

Previously agenev regulations had been a complete

14

bar to negotiations under the executive order practice. .

IS

Executive Order 11838 relaxed that limitation but did so in

16

a particular and, we believe, in a deliberate compromise

17

fashion by giving the jurisdiction to the Federal Labor

18

Relation Council, the Authority's predecessor, and only under

19

particular procedural circumstances.

20

the Assistant Secretary of Labor also inherited that new power

21

at the same time.

22

There is no hint that

But even if the Authority's interpretation of the

23

executive order practice were correct, and we believe it

24

isn't, there is no persuasive reason to think that Congress

25

intended to enact the same procedure, for it didn't adopt the
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 620°4Mi

26

1

language, and as the Court of Appeals observed in the decision

2

in Fort Belvoir, Congress clearly had this executive order

3

practice before it when it enacted Title VII, and yet far

4

from adopting the same procedures, it instead adopted the

S

language that we now find in Section (a)(2) and (b).

6

The Authority offers no convincing explanation how

7

the superseded language of the executive order, which in our

8

view it in any event misconstrues, can overcome the plain

9

meaning of the compelling need provision.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY RUTH E. PETERS, ESQ.

17

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

18

MS. PETERS:

19

I have just a few brief points to make,

20

First of all, respondent has suagested that the idea]

Thank you,-Mr. Robbins.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

21

system that Congress had in mind was the issuing agency as

22

a necessary party to any compelling need determination by the

23

Authority.

24
25

I would suggest that if Congress

had that ideal

system in mind it would have made it plain, as it were, by

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 62S-40M

35

1

requiring that in the statute, but in fact it did not.

2

only reference to agencies as necessary parties are when the

3

Authority in its discretion holds hearings -under Section

4

7117(b),and the Authority to my knowledge ordinarily

5

does not and in fact has not held hearings in those types --

6

in that type of appeal procedure.

7

The

Secondly, I would again just emphasize that there

8

is no plain language in 7117.

9

that directly and explicitly discusses the relationship

10

between Section 7117 and the unfair labor practice procedures.

11

QUESTION:

12

MS. PETERS:

13

QUESTION:

There is not a sinale word

Ms. Peters, can I ask —Yes.
— has the Authority ever found no

14

compelling need without holding a hearing?

15

never held a hearing.

16

MS. PETERS:

You say they have

So I guess —
Yes, under Section 7117.

Yes, and as

17

we noted, there are -- in our brief we noted the number of

18

cases that there were, and that by far those are cases in

19

which the Authority has not found compelling need.

20

QUESTION:

21

MS. PETERS:

22

QUESTION:

23

MS. PETERS:

Has not found a compelling need.
Yes, that's right.
And they are all cases without hearings?
The ones that are held under the

24

negotiability procedure, yes.

25

unfair’labor practice procedures, unless there was a

The 12 or 13 or so that were

1

stipulated record in some of them, there would have been

2

hearings, and the agency, if it were named as a party, would

3

have been a party, and could have asked to intervene or be an

4

amicus if it were not.

S

QUESTION:

Yes, that is — I had thought that, perhaps

6

the agency would only hold a hearing if it was — as many

7

courts might, that they would be, for example, very reluctant

8

to reverse the Court below without full argument, but would be

9

willing to affirm without setting the case for argument.

10

are telling me that that is not the key to whether you have

11

a hearing or not.

12

MS. PETERS:

No, the Authority makes the compelling

13

need determination, not the issuing agency.

14

issues the regulations and applies those regulations.

IS

You

The Authority

Secondly, as to the respondent's point that the

16

Authority has yet to make an argument based on the statute,

17

I would say that that is simply incorrect, and would direct

18

the Court's attention not only to the arguments made by

19

counsel but to the Authority's decision which discusses

20

explicit terms of the statute arid decides on the basis of those

21

terms that there is a distinction between ongoing negotiations

22

where negotiability defenses•must be raised through the

23

appeal procedure and unilateral change situations where they

24

can be raised in the unfair labor practice procedure.

25

And in terms of the respondent's notion that
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 62§»4iS8

37

1

Congress explicitly considered and rejected the practice

2

that we have suggested, again, we would suggest that that

3

is wrong.

4

compelling need for government-wide regulations not enacted,

5

but there is nothing in the legislative history to indicate

6

that those types of negotiability determinations which would

7

have been the only ones left under that legislative proposal

8

could not be made in the unfair labor practice proceeding in

9

a unilateral change context.

10

fact the Court in Defense Logistics Acre'ncy found support in

11

the legislative history to indicate that even those compelling

12

need determinations were directed onlv at the ongoing

13

negotiations scenario, and not necessarily at the unilateral

14

change situation.

Mot only was the legislative proposal for

It simply indicates, and in

And so not only was it not — not enacted, but there

15
16

is simplv nothing in the proposal that would support the

17

respondent's argument here, and in terms of their reliance

18

upon the difference of language in Section 7117(b) that the

19

Authority shall determine compelling need issues and the

20

language in 7117(c) that the union may appeal, we would point

21

out that those provisions simply aren't parallel, and contrary

22

to the respondent, there is a parallel provision’in Section

23

7117(c) which, of course, directs the Authority that it shall

24

determine those issues, too, when they are presented to the

25

Authority.

That provision is in Section 7117(c)(6).
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 62I-4MS

Whereas

38

1

the language "the union may appeal" in Section 7117(c) simply

2

indicates that the union need not appeal but can issue a

3

counterproposal

4

withdraw its proposal or do whatever it wishes instead of

5

appealing, and also that that optional language prevents.the

6

15-day time limit from automatically being triggered if there

7

is an allegation of nonnegotiability in the Section 7117(c)

8

proceeding.

QUESTION:

What if the agency who has -- what if

10

the Defense Department, at the same time this unfair'labor

11

practice proceeding is going on, determines that there is a

12

compelling need for the regulation?

13

to a different conclusion?

14

MS. PETERS:

Yes, indeed.

Can the Authority come

The Authority makes

IS

compelling need determinations, not — the Defense Department

16

is certainly the issuing agency, but the Authority has issued

17

the regulations that list the criteria for making these

18

determinations, and also puts the burden squarely on the

19

employer, and as we indicated in our brief, by a very larae

20

part compelling need determinations result in a finding that

21

there is no compelling need for the agency regulations.

22

QUESTION:

Well, the statute says that these

23

compelling need determinations shall be made only in accordance;

24

with, with -- what is the section?

25

MS. PETERS:

Section 7117(a)(2) is the section upon

Heritage Reporting Corporation

39

4

which the respondent principally relies.
QUESTION:

Well, what if a determination is‘made

pursuant to that section?
MS. PETERS:

Under that section again the

5

Authority applies r~ the same criteria govern and the same

6

burden is on the emnloyer agency, be it a neaoitability

7

determine or an unfair labor practice determination, the same

8

criteria apply, the burden remains upon the employer acrency,

9

and the employer agency of course --

10
11
12

QUESTION: Could the authority redetermine it in an
unfair labor practice proceeding?
MS. PETERS:

Well, having once made the determination

13

with respect to a particular regulation as how it fits against

14

a particular proposal, I am not sure that there would be any

15

need to, but of course the executive order addressed the

16

notion of seriatim proceedings and thought that it would be

17

better to put everything in one proceeding, and the Authority

18

has simply continued with that practice.

19

Thank you.
