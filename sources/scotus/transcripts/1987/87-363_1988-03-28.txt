ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD G. TARANTO, ESQUIRE

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 87-363

MR. TARANTO:

We are here asking this Court to uphold the

3

Commission's view of the statute, and to uphold a second

4

Commission ruling which gave rise to the second question in

5

this case and which I plan to discuss at the end.

6

In considering how this case arose it is useful

7

to have in mind one very common type of gas sale contract

8

that producers entered into in the mid to late 1970s and

9

early 1980s.

10

or more, and they expressly anticipated the coming

11

deregulation in 1985 and 1987 of the most important of the

12

categories of natural gas under the NGPA.

Those contracts were for long terms, 20 years

13

The contracts provided that until deregulation

14

occurred the gas would be sold, at the highest applicable

15

ceiling price set by law or Ccmmission order, and when

16

deregulation occurred, either the price would be renegotiated

17

or it would be determined by reference to some market price.

18

To ensure the highest possible ceiling price

19

during regulation while providing in advance for a change

20

in pricing upon deregulation, producers obtained qualifica­

21

tions for particular quantities of gas in several different

22

categories under the NGPA, some of which would be deregulated

23

in a few years .

expectation that when deregulation occurred they would

Producers

5

As the May 1985 deregulation date approached,

6

market prices had dropped drastically and were now well

7

below ceiling prices in some of the alternative categories

8

for which producers have qualified their gas.

9

ducers therefore sought to escape deregulation clauses in

10

their contracts by trying to prevent their gas from becoming

11

deregulated and having it treated under one of the still

12

regulated categories for which it had been qualified.

Many pro­

rule that rejected this effort.

12

It is a better interpretation of the

First, Section 101(b)(5) of the Act, which addresses

13

the general question of how to treat gas that is qualified

14

in two categories, says that if more than one of the NGPA

15

pricing provisions applies, "the provision which could

16

result in the highest price shall be applicable."

17

That language does not, as the Court of Appeals

18

thought, refer to particular producers or to their contract

19

prices.

20

statutory ceiling prices is the highest.

21

the highest ceiling price is the one that "could result" in

22

the highest price, and of course if one provision says that

23

there is no ceiling price, that is the provision that could

24

result in the highest price, and so the gas must be treated

25

under that provision, that is, it is deregulated.

It requires a determination of which of several

of ensuring that they are below any statutory ceiling.

The NGPA only sets

In addition, the contracts like the ones I described

at the outset show that it is the law that was meant to

QUESTION:

Mr. Taranto, perhaps I am naive, but

20

if some of- this gas is deregulated and some isn't, and the

21

deregulated price is lower, who buys the stuff at the higher

price?

25

is sufficiently plentiful that new contracts are indeed

The answer to that question turns

1

beincr written so that purchasers never pay more than the

deregulated price.

3

case is a whole series of contracts written from the mid­

4

seventies until the early eighties, very long-term contracts

5

in which producers and purchasers locked themselves into —

6

into contracts that did not provide for a maximum deregulated

7

price, so the purchasers here under these contracts if the

8

regulated category applies would be stuck at that regulated

9

ceiling.

What is principally at issue in this

10

QUESTION:

11

contract interpretation then.

12

But it is not a question just of

MR. TARANTO:

No, the contracts themselves look

13

to the statutory regulatory interpretation in order to

14

determine which clause of the contracts applies.

IS

the price that a producer can obtain from a purchaser does

16

turn on the contract, but again, those contracts look back to

17

the regulatory status to determine which clause is

18

applicable.

19

QUESTION:

Ultimately

Mr. Taranto, would you explain how the

20

circularity problem arises with the Court of Appeals'

21

interpretation?

22

MR. TARANTO:

Well, the contracts as I describe

23

as written say in one clause if the gas is regulated then a

24

certain price applies, or the maximum legal price applies.

25

If the gas is deregulated, then some other mechanism for

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

9

1

determining price is triggered, either reference to some

2

market or what is quite common, a renegotiation.

3

contracts are written on the assumption that some external

4

action,that one would have to look to what the statute says

5

or what the Commission has done in order to determine which

6

of the contract clauses applies.

7

Those

The circularity that I referred to would arise if

8

the statute itself required a reference to the particular

9

contracts to determine which of the clauses applies, and the

10

clauses of the contracts themselves then required a reference

11

back to the statute to determine which applied.

12

QUESTION:

They wouldn't.

I mean, you'd be able

13

to -- I don't see how you end up in any circularity.

14

be a strange situation, but you would still be able to know

IS

from looking at the contract whether the — either — if

16

it's a renegotiated price it obviously could be higher than

17

the ceiling price, and if it is a fixed price in absence of

18

regulation you can look, at what that fixed price would be.

19

It seems to me you would be able to tell from looking at the

20

contract whether it could be higher or not.

That's right, I think one can get

off, and with a renegotiation clause, as the Court of Appeals
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

10

1

pointed out, typically where one would get off is at the

2

regulated price, because the producer would have no incentive

3

to renegotiate below the regulated price.

4

My reference to the circularity was to ref.1 ect

5

the assumptions of all the contracting parties of the time

6

as to which of the two places, the contract or the law, would

7

determine the applicable category.

8

QUESTION:

Counsel, you have really already

9

addressed the argument in part by saying that you think

10

there's nothing in the overall scheme of the Act that

11

indicates Congress wanted the highest price at all times,

12

but that means, though, that the last clause of the sentence

13

that we're -- the section we are looking at is a little

14

bit out of step with the scheme of the Act, .doesn't it,

15

because it does say the provision which could result in the

16

highest price shall be applicable, and when one first looks

17

at this case, it looks like there's a policy for the Congress

18

to allow the maximum price.

19

MR. TARANTO:

I think the policy here is to allow

20

the maximum permissible price set by law with parties free

21

to negotiate under that ceiling according to their bargaining

22

power and market conditions.

23

the words "could result in the highest price."

24

"could result" language here as referring to the highest

25

price set in a particular producer's contract would really

reference to a ceiling price.

6

We think the

Congress, as I had suggested, had no intent to

categories.

11

12

Congress intended a one-way transition to

That basic design of the statute which generally

13

deregulates new gas indicates that Congress intended market

14

forces to apply to an ever-increasing proportion of the

IS

market as old gas was generally depleted and a higher and

16

higher proportion of the gas available in the market became

17

new gas.

18

And finally, the possibility that deregulated eras

19

would come back under regulation is one that Congress did

20

address in Section 122 of the Act, and it provided there

21

precisely one mechanism for a return ot regulated status,

22

action by Congress or the President one time, and only

23

temporarily.

into the indefinite future.

2

Finally, let me say a word about the second

3

question in this case.

4

Gas Policy Act allows the Commission to define categories

5

of gas that would get special production incentive pricing.

6

The Commission defined a category called, new type formation

7

gas, and said that in order to ge qualified in that

8

category gas must first be determined to meet the qualifica­

be applicable in order to qrant the new type formation

QUESTION:

May I ask you one question about the

2

first issue in the case rather than the one you just

3

addressed?

4

Have you abandoned reliance on Section 121?
MR. TARANTO:

No, we rely on Section 121, but in

5

court we rely on it as additional evidence of how 101(b)(5)

6

should be interpreted.

7

the argument that 101(b)(5) is inapplicable and 121 by

itself in isolation answers the question.

20

don't get a determination unless you apply for the deter­

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. SOLOMON, ESQUIRE

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 87-364

7

MR. SOLOMON:

Thank you, Mr. Taranto.

May it please the Chief Justice,

8

Members of the Court, the petitioners in 364, the Public

9

Service Commission of the State of New York, the Associated

10

Gas Distributors, the Panhandle Eastern Pipeline, and the

11

Tennessee Gas Pipeline, have joined together in their

12

petition here because what we believe the lower court's

13

opinion erroneously has done is to prevent pipelines from the

14

benefits of their bargains as to how gas should be priced

15

under deregulation while at the same time allowing producers

16

to have the benefits of those bargains, and unfairly rasing

17

prices.

18

Now, we agree completely with the position taken

19

by Mr. Taranto as to the construction of 101(b)(5).

20

would point out that for the court's opinion below to be

21

upheld, it is not sufficient for my friends over here to

22

demonstrate that their construction of 101(b)(5) is a

23

possible one.

They have to show that the Commission's
construction of 101(b)(5) is an impossible one, because if

You wouldn't want those contracts, that

form of contract outlawed, would you?

20

MR. SOLOMON:

We would perhaps want to have take

21

or pay contracts reduced, and we are so arguing to the

22

Commission, and this was the issue in a case before the

23

Court of Appeals, but that's not what I'm discussing here

24

today.

25

Justice Stevens, we do rely on Section 121 as well
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

18

1

as 101(b)(5), which we think are consistent with one

2

another.

3

It's not just something we are dreaming up.

4

that Section 121 of the Act in and of itself makes clear

5

that what is involved in the deregulation process is the

6

removal of all price controls from the specific types of gas

7

which are deregulated.

8

thought that language meant, because if you look at the

9

conference agreement explaining what 121 of the Act means,

10

what they say, and I'm reading from Page 92 of the

11

conference agreement, they say the conference agreement

12

provides for the elimination of federal price controls for

13

certain categories of natural gas.

14

We do think, and the Commission said this, too.
We do think

Certainly that's what Congress

Thus the agreement -- that's the statute —

15

deregulates those categories for ceiling price purposes.

16

In other words, as we believe and have argued, the languaae

17

of 121 also makes clear what was being deregulated were

18

categories of gas, and what that deregulation did was to

19

make inapplicable the price control provisions of Title 1,

20

and that is, of course, the ceiling price.

21

So we believe that the Commission was clearly

22

correct in its interpretation of Section 121 and that that

23

is an additional reason supporting the Commission's

24

interpretation of 101(b)(5).

25

are both at least as good a construction of those two

They are consistent, and they

Heritage Reporting Corporation

sections as the decision below.

2

Now, the Court did not disagree with the

3

Commission's interpretation of 121.

4

said it was a rational position, but then said it was over­

5

ruled by their construction of 121 — I mean, 101(b) (5) .

6

Now --

7

QUESTION:

On the contrary, it

Mr. Solomon, does it make any

difference for purposes of other activities under the Act

which of those interpretations -- suppose we come out your

10

way.

11

provisions in the Act which of those two theories we take?

12

Does it make any differences for purposes of other

MR. SOLOMON:

Whether you take 121 or whether

13

you take 101(b)(5)?

14

consistent, and are saying in different ways — one is in

15

the language of the deregulation itself and the other is

16

a rule of construction.

17

I don't think so.

I think they are

The same thing.

As I said, the court position is entirely based

18

on the fact that the Commission's construction of 101(b)(5)

19

can't be right, and the reasons the Court of Appeals judge

20

gave for her views are set out essentially on Page 16 of the

21

Joint Appendix, 16A of the Joint Appendix.

22

And what you see she is saying there is, she says

23

the deregulated price is theoretical, and while it could be

24

higher, there are all sorts of provisions for raising the

25

other ceiling prices, and therefore maybe they could be
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

20

1

higher at some time.

2

But the answer to that is the X plus one rule.

3

Whatever price a ceiling is raised to, the absence of a

4

ceiling allows you to set a price one cent or more higher.

5

And therefore her argument as to -- on Page 16 as to why

6

the Commission's position can't be right is in our view

7

clearly wrong.

8

What is more, she talks about the price of

9

regulated gas could be higher than the price of deregulated

10

gas.

11

is what this whole case is about, but while the price of

12

regulated gas under a contract can be higher under certain

13

circumstances than the price of deregulated gas under a

14

contract, the statute says that the applicable provision of

15

the Act, either'this regulated price or a nonregulated

16

price, is what could lead to the higher price, and the

17

Commission is obviously right that what could lead to the

18

higher price is the absence of regulation.

19

to a higher price. W7hat this case is all about is, faced

20

with this statute, a number of producers and pipelines

21

agreed to contracts which said, in the event of deregulation

22

the price shall be X, usually they said, immediately on

23

deregulation it will stay the same as it was, but it shall

24

be subject to bilateral renegotiation.

25

That, of course, is true under the contract, and that

It may not lead

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. DAVIDSON, ESQUIRE

11
12

Thank you.
Thank you.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. DAVIDSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

13

please the Court, the unanimous Court of Appeals correctly

14

viewed this case as presenting a straightforward issue of

IS

statutory construction resolvable from the language of the

16

statute itself as well as from the explanatory materials

17

prepared by the conference committee.

18

But before I talk about the statutory language or

19

the conference materials, I'd like to first briefly deal

20

head on with certain other arguments that the petitioners have

21

heavily relied upon in their briefs, and which were aaain

22

referred to today in the oral argument.

23

Suggestions that this case raises some spectre of

24

some anomalous regulatory burden due to gas switching in

25

and out of regulation or the spectre of producers receiving
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

22

1

above market prices and therefore some windfall unanticipated

2

by Congress are not only tangential to the real legal issue

3

in this case, they are demonstrably false.

4

determine if producers receive what are in every sense

5

market prices they bargained for in their contracts with

6

interstate pipelines and relied upon in exploring and drilling

7

for certain kinds of gas for which Congress expressly

8

provided special incentive ceiling prices —

9

QUESTION:

This case will

Mr. Davidson, you say this case will

10

determine whether the producers will receive the market

11

prices they bargained for.

12

you have a contract price that may not necessarily be the

13

market price at all.

14

MR. DAVIDSON:

Now, ordinarily in a contract

negotiated here, the prices that were arrived at in the

power.

QUESTION:

They were prices that

the contract was negotiated?

22

MR. DAVIDSON:

Yes, sir.

prices will necessarily correspond to the contract prices

three or four years after the contract was executed.

MR. DAVIDSON:

It does not mean that market

prices negotiated into contracts today will be the same as
those prices negotiated in the earlier contracts.

That's

true.
QUESTION:

Well, it also means if you have a

contract for over 20 years what you negotiate as a market
price in the beginning of that contract may not be the same
price you could go out on the open market and buy four years
into the execution of the contract.
MR. DAVIDSON:

That's absolutely correct.

That

doesn't change the fact that prices negotiated into that
contract are by any definition when negotiated actual
market prices and they are continued as such.

As FERC itself

was at pains to point out in Note 3 of its reply brief,
market price merely means the price a particular purchaser
can obtain -- a particular producer can obtain from a
particular purchaser at a particular moment, and there could
conceivably be as many market prices as there are producerpurchaser transactions, and that is certainly the case and
certainly would be the case for a commodity like gas, which
is historically priced pursuant to such long-term contracts.
In discussing these particular issues, let me start
with the undisputable propositions that in the NGPA Congress
established different categories of gas and set different
ceiling prices for the various categories, and further, that
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

24

1

against that regulatory framework producers and pipelines

2

then negotiated different pricing provisions for the

3

different NGPA categories, one example of which Mr. Taranto

4

gave in his remarks.

5

For example, high cost, high risk Section 107(c)(5)

6

gas may be priced according to, say, Paragraph 5(A) of the

7

contract, whereas general new 102 gas may be priced

8

according to Section 5(B).

9

and risk Section 107 gas means

only that the parties

10

themselves price the amount of

that gas priced during the

11

prior month according to Paragraph 5(A) of their contract

12

rather than Paragraph 5(B).

13

Categorizing gas as high cost

There is no other regulatory consequence.

In

14

every respect relevant to this

case the NGPA is merely a

15

price ceiling statute.

that gas is "regulated" means

16

only that it is subject to a ceiling price.

17

no certificates or filings or hearings or administrative

18

proceedings.

19

Saying

It involves

So the fact that a gas is regulated or

20

deregulated changes from one such category to another

21

involves no regulatory burden on FERC or anybody else.

22

It means only that the parties to a private contract them­

23

selves refer back to that contract to determine how that

24

quantity of gas should be priced according to the

25

particular contract provision

that they have agreed upon.

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

25

The whole reason for Section 101(b)(5) being

1

2

in the statute is that Congress knew the gas could be

3

qualified in more than one such category.

4

the particular kinds of gas which are really at issue in

5

this case, high cost, high risk, section 107(c)(5) gas,

6

and low production Section 108 stripper wells, gas of that

7

type is virtually always, if not always at least

8

qualifiable in one of the more generic NGPA categories.

9

is either old or new gas, offshore or onshore, interstate

10

or intrastate,

11

attributes which also make it qualifiable for Section

12

107(c)(5) or Section 108.

3

With respect to

in addition to havint those special

Now, despite the inevitably of such dual

4

qualification for such gas, Congress provided in the NGPA

5

that high cost and risk

6

well 108 gas were entitled to higher ceiling prices, thus

7

leaving producers free to try to negotiate higher prices

8

for that kind of gas than they could obtain for the more

9

generic kinds of gas that were subject to lov/er NGPA

20
21

It

ceilings.
Now, where the producers were successful, such

22

as in the case of my client, Martin Exploration, which

23

entered into a long-term contract with the petitioner,

24

Panhandle Eastern Pipeline, the price it negotiated for its

25

high cost and risk gas is higher than the price for its more
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

26

1

generic kinds of gas, but then it was always intended that

2

that price be higher.

3

higher ceilings that Congress expressly labeled as incentive

4

prices, designed to call out additional gas production on

5

the margin, and in reliance on those higher prices which

6

Martin negotiated in its contract with Panhandle, it went out

7

and drilled and explored for this high cost and risk gas.

8

These were prices negotiated under

For Martin to now receive those higher incentive

9

prices for that category of incentive gas is in no manner

10

an unanticipated windfall, a producer assistance policy

11

outside the parameters of Congressional debate, or any of

12

the other labels that the petitioners have fashioned.

13

the contrary, such higher incentive prices were expressly

14

intended by Congress in the NGPA for those particular kinds

15

of gas.

16

To

Now, as to the level of those prices, let's start

17

with the ceiling prices.

18

price for Section 10B stripper well gas in the NGPA, and in

19

the context of this case none of us are free to question

20

that judgment.

21

Congress itself set the ceiling

As for high cost and risk Section 107(c)(5) gas,

22

FERC sets that ceiling price.

23

a year, and upon a proper record, can lower that ceiling

price if it is in some way out of line or unjustified.

MR. DAVIDSON:

11

QUESTION: What I am trying to find out is, why

12

isn't this simply a contract case?

13

MR. DAVIDSON:

It is not a contract case in the

14

sense that what FERC is really done by this order is fore­

IS

ordained the result in all of the contract cases that could

16

arise.

17

In other words, ultimately the parties

18

to the contract themselves have to look at their contract

19

to determine what happens upon deregulation of some

20

categories of gas.

21

say that as a matter of law gas which is categorized in

22

the Section 107(c)(5) or 108 category must be deemed to be

deregulated.

Why can't you simply sue your customer

14

QUESTION:

Well, what's the significance of that

to your contract?
MR. DAVIDSON:

Because that means that that gas

automatically then qualifies under the category and must be

18

considered to be gas sold under a category which is

to contract provisions which neither party ever intended to

MR. DAVIDSON:

That seems — well.
The only point in going through the

9

background is, there have been an awful lot of arguments that

10

we've heard, which are again referred to here in the oral

11

argument, about windfall prices and so forth, and really this

12

just comes down to whether or not the producers can obtain

the prices they negotiated for this kind of gas in their

contracts.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. DAVIDSON:

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Davidson -Yes, sir.,

-- let me ask you a question.

I

18

suppose the contract could have provided that if 107(c)(5)

19

gas is deregulated the parties shall continue to pay the

20

price that was in effect immediately prior to deregulation.

21

They could have agreed to do that, but instead — am I right

22

about that?

23
24
25

MR. DAVIDSON:

Yes, if the parties had assumed

that Section 107(b)(5) gas would be deregulated.
QUESTION:

Yes, if they thought it was possible,

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

30

1

they could have said, we'll continue to pay the same

2

price, or some other category.

3

you probably didn't want to do that because you assumed

4

at the time that upon deregulation the price would go way

5

up.

MR. DAVIDSON:

QUESTION:

9

But I guess at that time

No, sir, we —

So you would have wanted to have the

deregulated price.
MR. DAVIDSON:

No, sir, there was no provision

10

placed into the contract for what you should do if Section

gas is never deregulated under the statute.

will take effect if and when the law is changed.

2

MR. DAVIDSON:

That is possible, except in this

3

case the NGPA has not been amended.

4

has not been deregulated, and the contract provisions which

5

were negotiated said that properly qualified 107(c)(5) wells

6

were to be priced according to a particular contract

7

paragraph, and the parties did not negotiate or even

8

envision at that time in many of these contracts that that

9

kind of gas would be priced according to an entirely

10

different contract provision.

11

to the statute to change that situation, so that's the

12

reason in the case of these special categories of gas.

13
14

QUESTION:

There has been no amendment

Does the record contain an example of

the text of the contract we're talking about?

MR. DAVIDSON:

The record doesn't contain an

example of any particular contract provisions that I'm aware

17

of, although both of the petitioner's briefs contain

references to examples of the kinds of contracts which

19

exist.

Is your answer to Justice Stevens'

you could have drafted the contract in order to get the

result you wanted?
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

32

MR. DAVIDSON:

1

With the benefit of hindsight,

2

sort of the Monday morning quarterbacking, I suppose you

3

can draft a contract to ccver any eventuality.

4

think that there's any question about that, but the problem

5

is that we did negotiate a contract under an existing

6

statute that has not been changed, and in the case of Martin

7

Exploration, for example, it's qualified its gas under the

8

particular category that it thought would wind up giving it

9

fhe highest price, and in its case did not even qualify the

10

gas in any other category.

11

risk wells pursuant to Section 107(c)(5), and not according

12

to any of the other deregulated categories.

I don't

It qualified its high cost and

What PERC Order 406 says is, notwithstanding that,

13
14

that gas must be considered to be deregulated Section

15

102 or 103 gas, and since it automatically is deemed to be

16

such deregulated gas it falls into a different contract

17

provision.

18

That is the type of thing that is very hard to

19

envision, and I suppose we could do that now with the

20

benefit of hindsight, but it is difficult to imagine all the

21

possible ways in which the law could be changed, and given

22

retroactive effect in previously existing contracts.

23

QUESTION:

Well, supposing you could show that it

24

was the intent of both parties here that when you said

25

unregulated gas, for example, you meant unregulated gas as

you understood it, and regardless of anything FEkC ever

did about it.

. MR. DAVIDSON:

Well, there will be underlying

contract issues that could arise later on after this FERC

order, but I think that if FERC's order is effective, which

6

says that as a matter of law this certain kind of gas, which

7

is 107(c)(5) gas, is to be deemed deregulated 102 or 103

it true that every contract is amendable by agreement of

the parties, so even if you look at it in a concrete fashion,

10

and look at this particular contract between the parties,

11

that particular contract could result in the higher price

QUESTION:

So on any interpretation I don't see

21

how you could say, whether you do it concretely or

22

abstractly, that anything but the deregulated price could

23

result in the highest.

24
25

MR. DAVIDSON:

Remember that the way it really

works in the real world is that what the parties do is, at

1

the end of every month they total up how much gas was

2

purchased the prior month, and they look at their contract

3

and say, okay, what do you have to pay for it?

4

that given month there was a contract, there were contract

5

provisions that were in effect, and the parties just have

6

to determine what the appropriate price is from their in

7

effect contract provisions.

8

Now, for

We don't believe that Congress was concerned with

9

the hypothetical possibilities of what could be true in the

10

future under different market conditions or under different

11

contract provisions, for that matter, in the case of your

12

example.

We think that what Congress said was that when you

3

had gas that was classified in more than one category, the

4

price that is to be applied is the price that the parties

5

apply as a matter of course in their contracts, which are in

6

effect for a given time period, when they compute what the

7

price for that gas purchased during that time period

8

should be.

Yes.

QUESTION:

2

MR. DAVIDSON:

Okay.
There is no question about that.

3

That does refer to the statutory provision which places an

4

NGPA category label on the gas which the parties then take

5

back to their contract for the purposes of determining what

6

the contract price will be.

7

With that general background, I'd like to address

8

what we do believe to be the central legal issue in the case,

9

which is just that Order 406 is inconsistent with the

10

language of Section 101(b)(5) of the statute as well as the

11

conference committee materials.

12

406 is inconsistent with the plain meaning of Section

13

101(b) (5) .

14

Our position is that Order

I recognize that FERC also argues that the language

15

of Section 101(b)(5) plainly supports their position.

16

merely because a party utters the words "plain meaning"

17

doesn't make it true.

18

other, is fairly subject to examination, and for that

19

reason I think it is helpful to compare the plain meaning

20

arguments, the two of them being advanced in this case.

On the one -- so

If it's a standoff, you lose.

They just have to establish a meaning that's

way.

2

QUESTION:

Assuming that the Congressional intent

3

can also not be determined from the legislative history, but

4

we believe that the language, the interpretation which FERC

5

has adopted is inconsistent not only with the language, but

6

also with the materials in the conference report.

7

Our plain meaning argument is simply stated.

The

8

plain meaning of language is the meaning one first and

9

naturally attaches to it when one sees it or hears it.

10

the unanimous Court of Appeals held, the plain and ordinary

11

meaning of the relevant language of Section 101(b)(5) that

12

if any natural gas qualifies under more than one provision,

13

the provision which could result in the highest price is,

14

the producer gets the highest price.

As

16

to convey, this is how you would write :it, or perhaps

17

something very close to it.

18

thought one wanted to convey was that if gas qualified for

19

at least one NGPA category, which is deregulated, it shall

20

be deemed deregulated, this probably isn't the way that you'd

21

write it.

22
23
24
25

If on the other hand the

And that in a nutshell is our plain meaning
argument.
Now, FERC has a different problem, and that is
illustrated no better than on Page 2 of its opening brief,

(202) 628-4888

38

where Section 101(b)(5) and Order 406 are laid out right

2

next to each other for easy comparison.

3

when you just read these two sentences, the interpretation

4

that FERC is adopted in

5

you in the statute.

6

The fact is that

Rule 406 just doesn't leap out at

Indeed, when you read those two sentences, they

7

just seem inconsistent, and for that reason FERC's plain

8

meaning argument is different in character than respondent's,

9

and oddly enough, for an argument of this type, it keeps

10

changing.

11

FERC has suggested at least three plain under­

12

standings of this statute in the course of these proceedings,

13

and of course we know that Mr. Solomon has advanced yet

14

another one.

15

about the language of Section 101(b)(5) goes on for almost

16

seven full pages, parses through that one sentence in great

detail, several individual words and phrases are expanded into

full explanatory paragraphs.

In its current iteration, FERC's argument

There are references to other NGPA provisions.

There are references to FERC's view of the overall structure

21

and approach of the statute, and even to bits of legislative

history.

23

whatever else one wants to say about it, it just isn't a

24

plain meaning argument.

25

That argument gets so complex and involved that

The natural reading of this statute is the one

that the Court of Appeals adopted.

discussing Section 101(b)(5) in their explanation statement

5

that a producer was entitled to qualify his gas in whatever

6

NGPA category which yielded the highest price to him, which

7

necessarily requires the producer to go back to his contract

8

to see which NGPA category accomplishes that result.

9

Moreover, the Court of

First, the House conferees stated when

Now, there is no logic in then coming along later

10

and telling the producer, forget about the relative price

11

levels in your actual contract that you looked at originally

12

because what you -- the way you are really going to be paid

13

is according to the abstract notion of whether or not the

14

NGPA category has a price ceiling, and if it does, which

15

price ceiling is higher, as the government argues.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Davidson, if we think that the

17

language in the statute is capable of being read as the

18

government would have us read it, do you then lose because

19

of the difference that is owed to the agency interpretation?

20

MR. DAVIDSON:

First of all, this is not an agency

21

deference case in our view because the intent of Congress

22

can be determined not only from the language but also in

23

addition from the conference materials, one of which example

24

I just gave and another key one which I will come to in a

25

moment.
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

40

1

But moreover, it is not an agency -- the government

2

doesn't even win on an agency deference standard because it

3

is not a permissible reading of the statute and does not

4

satisfy certain purposes of Congress when it passed the NGPA.

5

For example, the purposes that these special categories of

6

incentive priced gas were entitled to incentive prices

7

pursuant to Sections 107(c)(5) and Section 108.

8

Similarly, FERC' s order has the pract.ical effect

9

of depriving the producers of actual contract prices they

10

negotiated in their contracts, and that is certainly

11

inconsistent with at least the spirit of Section 101(b)(9),

12

which says that nothing in the NGPA's maximum lawful price

13

provisions or a ceiling price or deregulation should operate

14

to nullify or supersede a contract price.

IS

The second piece of the legislative history which

16

we think is key is the conference report itself, which is

17

intended to be the definitive explanatory statement of the

18

NGPA, and was probably crafted as carefully as the statute

19

itself.

20

Page 83 of the conference report states that upon

21

deregulation, wells qualified in both the Section 108 stripper

22

well category as well as the Section 105 intrastate

23

category, gas from those kinds of wells could be sold under

24

the regulated provisions of Section 108 rather than

25

taking deregulated treatment as Section 105 gas.
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

41

1

Now, FERC has tried to avoid this part of the

2

conference report by arguing that it was addressed to a

3

particular question not directly involved in this case, and

4

in its reply brief by trying to make the whole thing look

5

as complicated as possible.

6

I think the simplest response to FERC's argument

7

is that the nature and complexity of the question addressed

8

on Page 83 of the conference report really doesn't matter

9

here.

10

conference report gave says clearly, and clearly expresses

11

the understanding that dually qualified 108 and 105 gas could

12

be sold as regulated 108 stripper gas as opposed to deregula­

13

ted intrastate Section 105 gas, and FERC's order does

14

exactly the opposite.

15

is so duly qualified must be sold as deregulated Section 105

16

gas rather than as regulated Section 108 gas.

17

Whatever the question was, the answer that the

On that precise point, I think it's important
that the government really is arguing that it doesn't make

they have the right to redefine that gas.

In that order, FERC expressly refused to rescind

Congressional standard for being produced under such

conditions of extraordinary risks or costs that it was

entitled to the Congressional incentive prices that Congress
