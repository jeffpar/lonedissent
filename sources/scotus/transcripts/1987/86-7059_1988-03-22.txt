CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We will hear arquments

next in Number 86-7059, Tyrone Patterson versus Illinois.
Very well.

You may proceed whenver you are ready,

Mr. Honchell.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD S. HONCHELL, ESQUIRE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HONCHELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court, Tyrone Patterson, a 17-year-old youth,

11

was kept in custody for 44 hours without confessing,

12

without seeking to confess, until he was confronted by his

13

indictment, and he asks this Court to apply the safeguards of

14

Edwards versus Arizona and Michigan versus Jackson to protect

15

his constitutional right to counsel, which was automatically

16

applicable upon his indictment.

17

There is no dispute that that Sixth Amendment right

18

to counsel attached in this case, that it apply auto­

19

matically upon the indictment, and that it came into

20

existence without request or action or demand by Tyrone.

21

The question for Your Honors is a narrow one.

What

22

is the protection of that right?

23

Jackson, the suitable method to safeguard the Sixth Amendment

24

right to counsel is to bar the government from contact with

25

the accused concerning the case until counsel is present

As in Edwards, as in

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

3

1

unless the accused initiates communication with the

2

authorities, indicating a desire and willingness to discuss

3

the case.

4

fair way to treat a defendant whose right to counsel has been

5

invoked by the state through the action of indictment.

6

In this cause --

7

As in Edwards and as in Jackson, this is the only

QUESTION:

Do we know, counsel, in this case, what

8

arrangements had been made for his arraignment after the

9

indictment?

10

MR. HONCHELL:

11

QUESTION:

12
13

There is no indication --

He was indicted in the morning, I

take it, on the 23rd.
MR. HONCHELL:

Yes, that's correct.

The police

14

officer returned with the indictment to the police station

15

and that afternoon confronted him with the indictment before

16

the accused had been taken to court, before the accused had

17

been transferred to another facility where he would be

18

housed until taken to court.

19

was about to be removed from the custody of the investigating

20

officials, and that they used that opportunity to confront

21

him with the indictment in order to prompt a statement which

22

had not otherwise been obtained.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

It is clear that the accused

Does the record say that an arraignment

hearing had been scheduled?
MR. HONCHELL:

No.

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Honchell, I guess at bottom we are

2

concerned with knowing whether the defendant knowingly and

3

intelligently waived his right to have counsel present for

4

questioning.

5

Is that right?

MR. HONCHELL:

6

of this case.

7

Sixth Amendment --

The heart of this case is to protect the

QUESTION:

I would have thought our concern would

be whether he had waived his right to have counsel present.
MR. HONCHELL:

10
11

I don't believe that is the heart

The question once the Sixth

Amendment --

12

QUESTION:

A defendant can waive his right to

13

have counsel present, can he not?

14

MR. HONCHELL:

15

QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes, he certainly can.

And what information precisely do you

16

think is needed beyond what this defendant was told in order

17

to be able to make that decision?

18

MR. HONCHELL:

The question before the Court is not

19

the knowledge that any accused needs to waive Sixth

20

Amendment rights.:

21

QUESTION:

Did he need any information beyond what

22

he was given in order to make a knowing and intelligent

23

waiver?

24
25

MR. HONCHELL:

In protecting the Sixth Amendment

right to counsel he should not have been approached with any
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

5
1

information, including the Miranda warnings, and it would

2

not be the proper protection for this Court to decide the

3

amount of knowledge the accused should obtain for knowing

4

an intelligent Sixth Amendment waiver.

5

for the Court to decide what additional warnings should be

6

created.

7

It is not the issue

The question is the protection, and it is our

8

assertion that just as this Court decided in Edwards and in

9

Jackson not to decide what knowledge should be used to waive

10

right to counsel.

11

much knowledge is appropriate for waiver of counsel.

12

to protect from -- as a simple and easy surrender of

13

counsel.

14

by the authorities.

15

QUESTION:

16
17

This Court as well should not decide how
Rather,

The Court should protect it by barring any Question

Or affording any opportunity to try

to waive?
MR. HONCHELL:

Exactly. If the Fifth Amendment

18

right to counsel were under consideration the authorities

19

could secure a waiver by certain knowledge.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. HONCHELL:

Unless he asked for counsel.
Yes. If the accused asks for counsel

22

it is appropriate to protect it by barring any contact

23

between the accused and the authorities, whether it involves

24

Miranda warnings, super Miranda warnings, any degree of

25

information.
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

6

1

The equivalent protection when the Sixth Amendment

2

right to counsel attaches automatically is equally to forbid

3

providing information to the defendant unless the defendant

4

initiates the interrogation and thereby surrenders the

5

control of the interrogation to the authorities.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Honchell, would you just indulge

7

Justice O'Connor and me?

8

headedness we do think that the issue is whether the accused

9

made a conscious and intelligent waiver.

10

the question whether there is any information here that he

11

would have needed to know that was necessary for an

12

ingelligent, conscious waiver, that he didn't have?

13

MR. HONCHELL:

Let's assume that in our wrong­

Would you answer

There has been a wide variety of

14

opinion on the additional warnings beyond Miranda, the way

15

in whihh they are provided.

16

indicate that the accused must realize'the significance of

17

an indictment and the corresponding significance of the

18

Sixth Amendment right to counsel, that Miranda does not

19

contain provisions by which the accused becomes familiar,

20

and --

21

QUESTION:

The authorities seem to

But for the waiver in this incident,

22

for the waiver that would make admissible these confessions,

23

what additional information would he have had to know to

24

make his waiver of counsel at those confessions conscious

25

and intelligent?
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

7

MR. HONCHELL:

1

The additional information is

2

difficult to predict as a matter of abstract law.

3

additional information must familiarize him that he has a

4

Sixth Amendment right to counsel which attaches automati­

5

cally.

It is intended to protect him --

6
7

The

QUESTION:

He was told that, wasn't he?

He was

told that he had a right to counsel.

8

MR. HONCHELL:

He was told -- the word "counsel"

9

was used.

10

through information by which it would become meaningful to

11

him, because the method that was used was not designed to

12

alert the accused to the Sixth Amendment rights to counsel.

13

It was designed to offset the --

14

He was told he had a right to counsel.

QUESTION:

But not

I must say I don't understand what

15

you are saying.

16

Sixth Amendment right to counsel instead of iust, you have

17

a right to counsel?

18

You mean they should have said you have a

before the made the confession.

20

he have to know to make the waiver an intelligent one?

21
22
23

MR. HONCHELL:

Now, what in addition did

He had to meaningfully know he had

a Sixth Amendment right to counsel present because -QUESTION:

What is the difference between

24

meaningfully knowing and knowing?

25

MR. HONCHELL:

Because the warning here used

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

8

1

did not convey or express what counsel was intended to do

2

for him after indictment.

3

QUESTION:

So then you say in answer presumably

4

to Justice O'Connor's question and Justice Scalia's question

5

he would have had to be told more about what counsel would

6

do for him after indictment before he could intelligently

7

waive?

8
9

MR. HONCHELL:

That there is a right to counsel who

would act on his behalf and represent him.

10

QUESTION:

Well, don't you think this warning gave

11

him the impression that there was a right to counsel

12

who would act on his behalf and represent him?

13

MR. HONCHELL:

14

outside pure Miranda.

15

defense.

16

QUESTION:

No, there is nothing in this warning
Miranda was not designed to indicate

Well, okay.

So it should have said,

17

in addition to saying counsel, counsel who would act on your

18

behalf and represent you?

19

solution?

20

MR. HONCHELL:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

That would have been the magic

That is a possible method, yes.

You think that would have made this

case come out differently, in your view?
MR. HONCHELL:

No, because in our view there should

24

not have been any waiver sought through Miranda warnings o r

25

otherwise because once the accused is indicted the Sixth

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

9

1

Amendment right to counsel is attached and we advocate the

2

same protection that this Court created for indicted

3

defendants or for defendants benefitting from Sixth

4

Amendment in Jackson and defendants requesting counsel in

5

the Fifth Amendment in Edwards.

6

In those two cases Your Honors did not say, well,

7

the additional warnings are necessary, or Miranda is

8

enough, or we are going to allow the police to interrogate

9

the defendants and get a warning.

10

there can be no interrogation, and that is simply the

11

equivalent protection that this Sixth Amendment right to

12

counsel should provide.

13

QUESTION:

Your Honors said that

Well, in Edwards we said there could

14

be no interrogation when the defendant has said, I want

15

counsel.

16

MR. HONCHELL:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Yes.

But now here nothing equivalent to that

happened, did it?
MR. HONCHELL:

That's correct, but it is not

20

necessary to ask for Sixth Amendment counsel to be

21

protected by it.

22

accused invoke his right to counsel, to have a right to

23

counsel deserving of protection.

to counsel.

MR. HONCHELL:

QUESTION: — a question about the standard?

Mr. Honchell, may I ask you -Yes, sir.
Here

5

the officer right after testimony before the grand jury

6

went back, talked to him, told him about the indictment.

7

Would the case be different in your view if there had been

8

a two or three hour interval, and in that interval there had

9

been a counsel designated by the judge to represent him, but

10

there was not an opportunity between the defendant and

11

the counsel to communicate, and the officer then went and

12

did exactly what he did here, gave exactly the same warning.

13

Would the case be the same, in your view, or would

14

it be different?

15

difference whether counsel has in fact been appointed?

Are we talking — does it make any

QUESTION:

Of course, there would be a very

serious ethical difference between the two.

20

MR. HONCHELL:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

I don't really think there would

Yes.

Oh, certainly.

But in constitutional terms I suppose

the cases would be precisely the same.
MR. HONCHELL:

It would be precisely the same

24

because the Sixth Amendment counsel arises merely upon

25

being indicted.

It is the other side of the coin when a

From the point of view of the

either situation and he could waive whether he really has a

7

He could say, I don't need to talk to my

would be the same, and it is to bar any effort at getting a

11

through which the police cannot reach the defendant to obtain

a waiver, whether there is warnings specified or not, and it

is this inviolate protection which cannot be penetrated.

interrogation belongs in the hands of the defendant.

Well, under the Sixth Amendment.
Yes.

But why shouldn't it have to be

MR. HONCHELL:

Because it is a much broader right

designed for much greater purposes, and it has been the

12

consistent policy of this Court because of its importance to

13

the trial itself that it attach automatically upon indictment,

14

that it extend to pre-trial proceedings because of the harm

MR. HONCHELL:

In that proceeding I think I

would indicate yes, he could be approached by the authori­

ties,. because by waiving his right to counsel at the

11

arraignment in court, it would be an indication he need not

12

have counsel, but I think if the accused is to be fully

13

protected this Court must examine the extent to which he

14

indicates his forfeiture of counsel.

If he simply indicates I do not want counsel, that

would not be an indication that he is willing to discuss

19

discuss the case without counsel, the authorities can then

20

proceed to get the waiver through the particular warnings,

And wherever the control is placed, it indicates the

So you would say there should be

greater protection if he has actually had a lawyer appointed
for him than if he had not.
MR. HONCHELL:

7

It should be the equivalent pro­

tection.

If he is represented by a lawyer or he has the

9

right to be represented by a lawyer he cannot be approached

10

by the authorities.

11

QUESTION:

Yes, but see, in the case where a

12

lawyer has been appointed, you :seem to be conceding that

13

it would be perfectly permissible for the police to have

14

a situation arise in which the accused initiates some kind

15

of a conversation like this.

16

MR. HONCHELL:

17

QUESTION:

19

Yes.

And they could go ahead and

interrogate him without ever telling a lawyer.
MR. HONCHELL:

Oh, no.

I understand.

No.

In

that situation the accused lawyer would need to know of

21

the police action.

It has not been especially decided as

of cuts both ways, is why the constitutional protection

MR. HONCHELL:

Couldn’t the

I don't think the protection would

throughout the pretrial, trial, and posttrial stages, but

11

at any step of those proceedings the defendant can initiate

contact with the authorities, send word that he wishes to

speak to the officials.

14

rely upon the Sixth Amendment protection, and if there is

15

counsel introduced in the case, then I think there is the

extra protection of advance

be allowed to approach the defendant, begin contact through

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We will hear now from you, Mr. Donatelli.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACK DONATELLI, ESQUIRE

7

8

Thank you, Mr. Honchell.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. DONATELLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9

please the Court, Your Honors, the State of Illinois does

10

agree that this case is about what effectuates a knowing

11

and intelligent waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to

12

counsel, and on this issue we maintain that the Miranda

13

warnings must be given their common sense meaning, that

14

if they are given this meaning, that the four Miranda

15

warnings which apprise a suspect of his Fifth Amendment

16

privilege against self-incrimination also by their content

17

necessarily apprise him of his Sixth Amendment right to the

18

assistance of counsel and form the basis on which he can

19

make a knowing and intelligent waiver.

20

QUESTION:

May I ask you the same question I asked

21

your oppontent?

22

had in fact been appointed?

23

The --

Would you take the same position if counsel

MR. DONATELLI:

If counsel is merely appointed by

24

a court, Justice, and the defendant doesn't know about it,

25

I think that plays no role in his -- in the waiver.
Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

QUESTION:

So in other words, if there were a

2

procedure in Illinois where the judge would, immediately upon

3

the return of an indictment, appoint a lawyer for the man,

4

but there is obviously going to be some delay before they

5

get together, the police could nevertheless still take the

6

indictment, go to the man, and tell him about the indictment,

7

and have a conversation arise like this, and give nothing

8

more than Miranda warnings, and that would be adequate

9

protection?

10

MR. DONATELLI:

I think it would be adequate in

11

this regard.

12

comprehension of his rights and his election whether to go

13

with counsel or forego it.

14

It certainly doesn't affect the defendant's

QUESTION:

So --

So his rights, at least until he has

IS

talked to the lawyer and the lawyer has given him some

16

additional advice, his rights after indictment and before

17

indictment in this -- in a custodial setting are precisely

18

the same.

19

MR. DONATELLI:

20

QUESTION:

There —

I mean, there is an additional pro­

21

vision of the Constitution to rely on, but as a practical

22

matter they are exactly the same.

23

MR. DONATELLI:

That's right.

In terms of the

24

knowing and intelligent waiver of them, I would agree with

25

that point, Your Honor.
Heritage Reporting Corporation

QUESTION:

What about, say, a

week after he had

2

met with the lawyer, and so forth and so on, actually, then he

3

knew that he had a lawyer.

4

thing, it is okay for the prosecutor to go talk to him?

5

6

MR. DONATELLI:

You would still say the same

If a defendant knew he had a .

lawyer?

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. DONATELLI:

Yes.
Once the defendant knows he has a

9

lawyer, and thereby somehow evinces a request for a lawyer,

10

then I think the Edwards rule or the Michigan versus

11

Jackson rule would kick in whereby the police could no

12

longer initiate any kind of interrogation or anything

13

like that, but just having counsel appointed by a court,

14

and that knowledge is not known by the defendant, and he

15

has made no assertion that he might want counsel on his own,

16

I think that has no bearing on the validity of his waiver.

17

QUESTION:

Counsel, can the police delay the

18

indictment -- or the arraignment for a few hours in order

19

to talk to him a little bit more?

20
21

MR. DONATELLI:

22

Could they delay the

2

MR. DONATELLI:

I don't see any problem with that,

3

Your Honor, so long as before the arraignment they aive him

4

his Miranda warnings, advise him, and he makes a knowing

5

and intelligent choice.

6
7

QUESTION:

There is no duty to arraign as

promptly as possible?

8

MR. DONATELLI:

Well, I know in Illinois the

9

arraignment has to take place within seven days, and a

10

further Edwards response to your questioning of Mr. Honchell,

11

this record is lacking on exactly what -- the arraignment

12

procedure.

13

up until this time, and I can't tell from the record exactly

14

when arraignment did eventually occur.

IS
16
17

It does appear that there was no arraignment

QUESTION:

Well, under the rule you propose there

would be an incentive to delay arraignment, would there not?
MR. DONATELLI:

In order to -- the incentive being

18

that they want to talk to the defendant before he ever talks

19

to counsel or --

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. DONATELLI:

Yes.
-- counsel at arraignment?

22

That could very well be, Your Honor.

23

I don't think that's any problem, because no matter whether

24

there is that incentive, whether they delay it or not, you

25

are still only going to have a wavier based on a full

I will concede that.

different than they were yesterday.

7

significance in perhaps --

8

The police have an additional fact that may

MR. DONATELLI:

Namely, they can go in and
The facts are a little
Isn't that of some

I think that is the kind of

9

information that is sometimes described as, it might be

10

hblpful, it might not be helpful to the defendant, but that

11

is not the question --

12

QUESTION:

I mean, it might be helpful to the

13

police in encouraging him to talk, that this is more serious

14

than it appeared yesterday, because now a grand jury has

IS

returned an indctment

16

MR. DONATELLI:

That's true, too, but again, that

17

is only knowledge that might be helpful to the police action

18

or the defendant's decision.

19

Court, though, is what is the knowledge that is necessary

20

to fully comprehend the right, and I maintain today that

21

that knowledge is not necessary to the waiver of the right.

22

QUESTION:

The question before this

Mr. Donatelli, I suppose we have been

23

talking about whether counsel has been appointed.

24

you really don't have counsel until you agree to have that

25

person represent you.

Isn't that right?

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

I suppose

25

1

MR. DONATELLI:

2

QUESTION:

That is my position.

I mean, the mere fact that the court

3

has named a counsel, that merely authorizes that individual

4

to come to the defendant and say, will you have me

5

represent you, but the court can't appoint a counsel

6

really.

7

MR. DONATELLI:

I agree with that exactly, and

8

that is certainly the point I was trying to make when I

9

said that knowledge.

10

response from the defendant

11

fact that a court on its own appoints an attorney for him

12

is meaningless to the waiver of the right.

13

QUESTION:

Unless there is some affirmative
saying I want an attorney, the

Well, Mr. Donatelli, as things

14

actually work in Cook County, Illinois, would a court

15

ordinarily appoint a counsel for a defendant when the

16

defendant wasn't present at an arraignment?

17

MR. DONATELLI:

That would not happen, to my

18

knowledge, Your Honor.

19

counsel is made at arraignment, and I have never heard of

20

any procedure in Illinois or anywhere actually where counsel

21

is appointed for a defendant outside his presence and

22

without his knowledge.

23

In Cook County, the offer of

So the State of Illinois' position is that from

24

listening to the Miranda warnings, those four warnings

25

together with the setting within which they are given, these
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

\

26

1

things convey to the defendant what he needs to know about

2

his right to the assistance of counsel, including that this

3

right could be an advantage to him and that if he foregoes

4

his rights it could be of a disadvantage to him.

5

It is clear from the common sense meaning of the

6

Miranda warnings that by telling him he has a right to

7

counsel, that means he can consult with counsel, he can have

8

counsel present with him at the time, and that he can avail

9

himself of counsel's good professional judgment.

10

QUESTION:

May I ask as a matter of practice

11

before indictment when the warnings are given and he knows

12

all this about getting a lawyer, how often does Cook County

13

actually provide a public defender for a person before he

14

has been indicted?

Does it ever happen?

15

MR. DONATELLI:

16

QUESTION:

How often does --

Yes, during a pre-indictment custodial

17

interrogation the Miranda warning is given saying you are

18

entitled to a lawyer and all this.

19

appoint a public defender before an indictment?

20

MR. DONATELLI:

21

QUESTION:

Do they ever actually

Your Honor, I don't know that --

So that really -- that warning is a

22

little misleading, I think, pre-indictment, isn't it?

does he get the lawyer?

MR. DONATELLI:

He says, I want a lawyer.

At the time of pre-indictment?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

27

1

QUESTION:

Yes.

2

They just stop questioning him, don't they?

3

MR. DONATELLI:

That is probably true, and either --

4

I think it might be held in a spot where there might be a PD

5

around who could approach the defendant and ask him --

6

QUESTION:

What is a PD?

7

MR. DONATELLI:

8

QUESTION:

A public defender.

There might be a public defender there,

9

but the police actually go out and find one for him?

10

that the practice?

11

MR. DONATELLI:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. DONATELLI:

Is

That I don't know.

I don't think I've ever heard of —
If it is in a setting where there

14

might be one around, that could happen, but I would agree

15

with Your Honor that usually it would be that the -- just

16

questioning would cease until he gets an attorney.

17

Now, along with hearing that he has a right to

18

counsel, of course, the defendant also hears that he has a

19

right to silence, and I think the fact that these warnings

20

are given together suggest to him that these rights are

21

very intertwined at the time of custodial interrogation,

22

in other words, that counsel — he has to make a decision

23

about counsel before he does another thing.

24

to make a decision about remaining silent, and that counsel's

25

importance to him at that time has to do with his right to

He also has

is wanted to represent the accused?

MR. DONATELLI:

Once counsel is appointed at

7

arraignment, Your Honor, I don't know that there is any

8

mechanism whereby the police are told that they can no

9

longer interrogate him now at their own initiation, but of

10

course Michigan versus Jackson from this Court would tell

11

them that, would tell the police that.

Is that enough?

QUESTION:

MR. DONATELLI:

No.
I think if that -- yes, because

that gives him the basis on which he can fully comprehend

and know and intelligently waive his right.:

16

QUESTION:

You think arraignment proceedings are

no more extensive than just reading Miranda rights?

17

MR. DONATELLI:

I think practically speaking

18

you are right, it would involve more than that, but I don't

19

think that the way the judge would inform the defendant

20

of his right to assistance of counsel and asking him if he

21

wants counsel appointed, I don't think he would read the

22

Miranda warnings from him, but I am saying their content --

23

in other words, the judge, I think, would give him the

24

equivalent content, but not by reading those warnings off

25

It wouldn't be in the nature of a warning, I

would assume.

You are right.

MR. DONATELLI:

At arraignment that would

That clarification is very

You are right.
The Miranda warnings are what conveys the knowt

15

QUESTION:

Yes.

So then there is again the

16

incentive to delay arraignment if the police want further

17

interrogation.

18

MR. DONATELLI:

I don't think that is any problem,

19

Your Honor, and the reason is, is that our criminal justice

20

system has a goal of having the most accurate and reliable

21

convictions.

22

best evidence and best assurance that the judgment of

23

guilty is indeed accurate and truthful.

24
25

I think confessions from a defendant are the

QUESTION:

And I suppose you would think it would

be proper for the prosecutor, not just the police, to go in

have a chat with the defendant.

too, isn't it?

4

MR. DONATELLI:

5

QUESTION:

That is perfectly all right,

Yes.

Let the lawyer do it, because he is

6

probably professionally better trained even than the police,

7

and he is probably better able to get to the bottom of the

8

true facts.

9

MR. DONATELLI:

10

QUESTION:

I would agree with that.

That would be an approved procedure,

11

to have the lawyer go to his adversary without counsel and

12

talk with him.

13

MR. DONATELLI:

So long as there has been no

request for counsel, yes, Your Honor, I would agree with

that.

16

QUESTION:

I suppose the police can always try

to play games with this.

MR. DONATELLI:

If we hold the way petitioner wants

That is exactly true.

There are

be able to talk with a defendant

MR. DONATELLI:

— before he has accepted counsel

There is no problem with that, I

MR. DONATELLI:

QUESTION:

10
11

12

Well, certainly there is that.

They can't just delay indefinitely.
That is exactly right, of course.

And I think you said earlier arraignment

has to be, what, within seven days?
MR. DONATELLI:

In Illinois.

That's my under­

standing, Your Honor.
But — so I think not only do the Miranda warnings

13

convey everything he needs to know at custodial interroga­

14

tion in order to effectuate a valid waiver, but I think

15

what petitioner's position misses is that Miranda, while it

16

serves the Fifth Amendment, it also impacts on the Sixth

17

Amendment concerns, and I think the Miranda opinion itself

18

recognized that.

19

In the opinion written by Chief Justice Earl

20

Warren, this Court explained that these warnings are good

21

not just for the privilege against self-incrimination, but

22

they come with residual benefits, and it talked about some

23

of those residual benefits.

24
25

So the Miranda opinion itself is replete with
such references to Sixth Amendment concerns as counsel's

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

33

1

presence in helping to maintain a fair balance between the

2

state and the individual and making available the advice

3

and good professional judgment of counsel, and referring to

4

the custodial interrogation as an adversarial encounter, so

5

I think petitioner's position sells Miranda short by saying

6

it merely protects Fifth Amendment concerns.

7

purpose of the warning, but even in Miranda this Court noted

8

that the impact was greater than that.

9

That may be the

I would also like to address what Mr. Honchell does

10

think is the issue today, and that is that no interrogation

11

could take place just by the filing of the indictment.

12

think that would not be a good result.

13

as I explained a little bit earlier, in the'situation where

14

there is a request for counsel.

15

because now we know that the defendant has asked to proceed

16

in all encounters with the police only with the help of

17

counsel.

18

I

It serves a function,

Then it is a good rule,

But as I said, our system of justice, criminal

19

justice has a great interest in securing confessions

20

because they make -- they are the best evidence of a

21

reliable guilty verdict, so that police should be able to

22

approach a defendant and talk to him about the case with

23

the intention of using his own words against him in this

24

case even after indictment.

25

I think it helps the criminal justice system
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

34

1

because it means the prosecution can come forward not only

2

with an adequate case or with a good case but with the best

3

case it has.

4

from the criminal justice system, I think, that is

5

unwarranted.

6

So that rule goes way too far and exacts a cost

One last point I would like to bring up, I would

7

just like to address, in our brief we raised an alternative

8

ground for affirmance.

9

were volunteered, so that there is no Sixth Amendment

10

right -- no Sixth Amendment waiver issue here at all.

11

Our position is that the statements

What I would like to say about it is, the response

12

to Mr. Honchell's argument in the reply brief that that

13

issue is waived, in support of his argument, he points out

14

that that issue is not contained in the opinion of the

15

appellate court or the Illinois Supreme Court. Well, as far as

16

that goes, he is correct, but I still think it is disingenu­

17

ous for him to raise the issue, since the state's brief

18

raisdd this argument on direct appeal, and Mr. Honchell was

19

counsel for defendant on direct appeal, and he responded to

20

that argument in his reply brief on Page 2, and on Pages 6

21

through 7 he .argued his response and that the appellate court

22

just didn't address the issue because they affirmed on

23

other grounds.

24
25

We again re-raised that issue in the Illinois
Supreme Court.

Again it was not resolved because the issue

we have preserved that issue.

12

it please the Court, we take as our starting point in

13

ascertaining whether the Miranda warning supplied petitioner

14

with the information that he needed for a knowing waiver of

15

his Sixth Amendment right to counsel at the pre-trial

16

interrogation.

17

The test that this Court has announced several

18

times in evaluating the knowing standard of a waiver,

19

whether the suspect knew the nature of the right being

20

abandoned and the conseguences of the decision to abandon it.

21

Taking the first part of that test, Miranda

22

warnings expressly convey to petitioner the substance of

23

his Sixth Amendment right.

24

to the assistance of counsel at the interrogation, and we

25

think that is the right itself, and it' is ..hard to argue that

They told him that he had. a right

1

the warnings do not convey that knowledge of the right.

2

The Miranda warnings also inform petitioner of

3

the consequences of his decision to waive that right,

4

first, that he would not have the assistance of a lawyer

5

in deciding whether to speak or to stand on his right to

6

remain silent, and second, that if he chose to respond to the

7

questions that he would run the risk that his uncounseled

8

answered would create incriminating evidence that could be

9

introduced against him at trial, and we think again that

10

is the consequence of the decision --

What is the Sixth Amendment right to

Is it the right to counsel at trial, or what?
MR. PINCUS:

Well, the Court has held that it is a

right that attaches on indictment and that applies in

15

various critical pretrial proceedings.

MR. PINCUS:

And it didn't waive anything else?
No, it was limited —
It's a waiver but it isn't?
Well, it is a waiver of the right

7

to counsel at this pretrial proceeding. The Court has made

8

clear that the right to counsel attaches, in addition to a

9

general right at trial, it is a right that comes into play

10

in critical pretrial proceedings such as interrogation --

11

12
13

QUESTION:

Why isn't this good to waive counsel

at trial?
MR. PINCUS:

Well, we don't think it conveyed to

14

him the knowledge of what the assistance of counsel

15

embodies at trial.

16

counsel in a variety of other procedures that take place

17

at trial, cross examination, the rules of evidence, and

18

things like that, and we think that, as the Court indicated

19

in Faretta, there would have to be a colloquy or a warning

20

that gives the defendant the information about what is going

21

to happen at trial so he can knowingly decide whether he

22

wants a lawyer to assist him with those procedures.

That is obviously the assistance of

19
20
21

MR. PINCUS:

Would that be sufficient?
Yes, we think that that would be

sufficient.
QUESTION:

Without giving notice to the lawyer,

that would be perfectly all right?
MR. PINCUS:

Right.

We think that the Sixth

22

Amendment gives the right to the defendant, not to the lawyer,

23

and it is the defendant's assertion of his right to counsel

24

that controls, that controls — that controlled in Michigan

25

against Jackson and that we think controls in this case, too.

If the defendant —

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Pincus, even if a lawyer

3

has been appointed, you think there is no obligation

4

whatever on the part of the police to let the lawyer know

5

they are going to be approaching the defendant with a

6

request for waiver of presence during the lineup?

MR. PINCUS:

Well, I assumed the question was that

the lawyer had not been appointed, and an arraignment or some

Would that be consistent with the Sixth

MR. PINCUS:

Well, I think the question there

14

would be whether there had been an initiation, whether

who had — who had approached whom, and I think --

I am saying they initiated precisely

20

They told him about the indictment here.

MR. PINCUS:

Why is

Well, the difference -- well, the

21

difference with this case is that in the hypothetical the

22

defendant had asserted his right to counsel, so then there

23

is a question of who initiated the interrogation.

24

that petitioner is quite wrong in saying that Michigan against:

25

Jackson should be transformed into a rule that takes effect

Heritage Reporting Corporation

We think

41

upon the assertion of the right by the defendant into a rule

2

that takes effect upon the attachment of Sixth Amendment

3

rights in the air without any decision by the defendant that

4

he wants to proceed with the assistance of counsel.

5

QUESTION:

Well, supposing they tell him, look, we

6

can either go ahead with the lineup right now, because we've

7

got these people here, or we can tell your lawyer about it

8

and arrange it at a time that is convenient for him, what

do you want to do, and he says, I will go ahead without.

10

they do that without telling his lawyer?

MR. PINCUS:

Well, again, Your Honor, that is

not this case.

Is there any constitutional objection

to their doing that without telling his lawyer?

MR. PINCUS:

the facts of this case, because in that case the defendant

21

has already, as in Michigan against Jackson, asserted that

22

he wants to proceed with counsel.

23

did not ever assert that he wanted to proceed with counsel.

and he had requested counsel or -QUESTION:

He had accepted counsel appointed

MR. PINCUS:

Yes, then it would be controlled by

16

is that Michigan against Jackson doesn't apply, and the Court

17

in Michigan against Jackson said in fact that the request

18

for counsel at the arraignment was, and I am quoting, "an

19

extremely important fact in considering the validity of

20

the waiver."

21

We think the difference here

And we think that is the important fact that is

22

missing here, and that is what changes the case.

23

defendant has not made the choice to be represented by

24

counsel, and what underlies Michigan against Jackson and

25

Edwards against Arizona, the two prophylactic rules, is the
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

The

43

1

fear that the police will try and get the defendant by

2

badgering him to change his mind where he had previously

3

asserted his right to counsel and agree to be interrogated

4

and what the court said is, we are not going to let the

5

police initiate once the defendant has made his choice, and

6

that is all we are asking for here.

7

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Pincus, what about this point

8

of possible manipulation of arraignment time to allow more

9

room for the police to approach the defendant if we were

10

to adopt your rule?

11

MR. PINCUS:

Well, Your Honor, the prosecution

12

controls both for the time of indictment and for the time

13

of arraignment, so we don't think that really it's going

14

to make -- moving the time back to indictment will just

15

introduce, as Justice Scalia pointed out, the possibility

16

that the indictment could be pushed back.

17

There are time limits on both.

We think there are

18

time limits on arraignment in Illinois, and we think -- and

19

in most systems, and we think there is control -- there

20

is some control, and either rule will not completely bar

21

the government from doing —

22

QUESTION:

But if we do rule for you, do you

23

think it is justifiable to delay arraignment in the hopes

24

that a Miranda warning will elicit this kind of

25

confession?
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

44

1

MR. PINCUS:

Well, Your Honor, we don't think that

2

the Miranda warning elicits the confession, but I think

3

that the prosecutor could delay the time of arraignment,

4

but it doesn't change --

MR. PINCUS:

Is that a difference?

Or maybe

that fact changes the calculus, as we discuss in our brief,

in any meaningful way.
