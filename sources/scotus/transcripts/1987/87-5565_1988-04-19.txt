CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear oral argument

Ms. Welling, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EVALYNN WELLING, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MS. WELLING:

8
9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Cherlyn Clark filed a support complaint against Gene

10
11

Jeter in 1983, on behalf of her daughter, Tiffany, who is 10

12

years old.

13

pursue claims for support against their parents at any time up

14

until the were 18 years old, and in some instances, beyond.

15

At that time Pennsylvania marital children to

However. Pennsylvania limited the right of non-

16

marital children to pursue claims for support against their

17

biological fathers by the requirement that paternity actions be

18

commenced within six years from the date of the child's birth.

19

In Pennsylvania, a support action can be begun, but

20

if a putative father denies paternity, it cannot be continued

21

until a paternity determination is made.

22

Gene Jeter raised, as an affirmative defense, the

23

six-year statute of limitations in paternity actions.

24

an affirmative defense to show Ms. Clark's support complaint.

25

Over the objections of the six-year statute of limitations was

3
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

This was

i

unconstitutional,

the trial court dismissed Cherlyn Clark's

2

support complaint on the basis that the statute of limitations

3

had passed.
While Cherlyn Clark's case was pending in the

4
5

appellate court, Pennsylvania enacted an 18-year statute of

6

limitations.

7

Pennsylvania highest court have refused to apply the 18-year

8

statute of limitations to Cherlyn Clark's complaint.

9

Both the intermediate appellate court and the

The first issue before this Court today is whether

10

the federal child support enforcement amendments of 1984

11

require the invalidation of the six-year statute of limitations

12

and require the application of an 18-year statute of limitation

13

to Cherlyn Clark's complaint.

14

The 1984 child support enforcement amendments are

15

part of Title 4(d) of the Social Security Act.

16

Part 4(d).

amendments.

Isn't that the way that one would normally

enforce the statute then?

decision to review for compliance and penalize the state, that

3

in a situation like that the federal courts have the power to

oversee the compliance of the state with the federal statute.

5

In this case --

6

QUESTION:

7

Was that a case involving the distribution

of funds, where the claimant was asking for funds?
MS. WELLING:

9
10

It was a case that involved an

exclusion from benefits of some AFDC recipients on the basis of
a state law.

11

QUESTION:

12

which were federal.

But what was involved were funds, part of

13

MS. WELLING:

14

QUESTION:

That is correct.

And that seems to me different from the

15

question that the Chief Justice was asking, because this is a

16

case in which you are saying simply that a state statute on a

17

procedural matter determining when an action can be brought

18

under state substantive law is void because of a spending

19

prohibition.

2

the other cases you have mentioned in your brief.

21

So I think Rosato is quite distinguishable as are

MS. WELLING:

Perhaps a better response to that would

22

be the case of Bennett v. Arkansas, which was very recently

23

decided by this case.

24

in which the federal law provides that social security benefits

25

cannot be garnished or attached.

That also was a Social Security Act case

5
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

Arkansas had a state law which specifically said

1

2

when a person who was receiving a social security benefit was

3

incarcerated the state could attach the social security

4

benefits essentially to pay for their upkeep while they were in

5

prison.
In that case, this Court held that the federal —

6
7

what had happened in that case to bring it to this Court was

8

that the State of Arkansas went into a state court and attached

9

the pension benefits.

0

that attachment the fact that the state law was in conflict

And the pensioner raised as a defense to

with the federal law.
And in that case, this Court held that the decision

-12

3

of the Arkansas court allowing this to proceed was reversed on

4

the basis that there was a conflict between the Federal Social

5

Security Act provision and the state law provision.
QUESTION:

16

There was no grant to the state of funds

7

involved in Bennett.

That was a provision by Congress that

8

said you shall not attach any of these benefits.

And the State

19

of Arkansas says we think there is an implied exception to

20

that.

21

so much money and says, to be eligible for these you have got

22

to have the following statutes in effect.

23

But that wasn't a question of whether the Congress grant

MS. WELLING:

The cases under the AFDC statute,

24

starting with King v. Smith, have dealt specifically with the

25

kind of problem that we have here where a person who is remote

6

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

I

from the procedure which is brought to bring a compliance

2

action depends upon the federal guarantees.
And in this case, Cherlyn Clark's case will go

3
4

forward if the federal law is complied with.

The compliance

5

under the statute is not required except after three years.

6

And the compliance may or may not deal with this issue.
If she -- she has no direct remedy against the HHS to

7
8

ask them, or make them bring a compliance case, and she has a

9

real harm caused to her now while her child is growing up and

10

needing the support, and the fact that the federal law is not

.1.1

being complied with.
QUESTION:

12

You still have a problem about

13

retroactivity, don't you?

14

have to say the federal law intended a later adopted state

15

statute to be applied retroactively.

16

MS. WELLING:

17

QUESTION:

18

MS. WELLING:

Even if you are right in a way, you

In the situation --

Is that right?

Is that right or not?

The retroactivity question is related

19

to the fact that Pennsylvania only allows support to be granted

20

from the date that a support complaint is filed.

21

the outset it's clear that we're not dealing with a child who

22

comes in now and asks for support back to the time that they

23

were one.

24

25

So that at

This kind of situation that will be presented at this
point is a situation where a child files a new complaint, or a

7

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

child had a complaint that's ongoing at the time that the 18-

£->

year statute is compelled.
QUESTION:

3

Well, Pennsylvania here said that it

4

wouldn't apply, the 18-year statute which has been adopted at a

5

certain time, to this case.
MS. WELLING:

6

In this particular instance it is clear

7

that the language of the statute comprehended this and included

8

it.

9

any child at any time.

They wanted -- they said that the statute was to apply to

10

QUESTION:

Who said that?

11

MS. WELLING:

12

QUESTION:

13

MS. WELLING:

14

QUESTION:

That's in the statute.

In the Pennsylvania statute?
No, in the federal statute.

Well, that's what I -- yes, so you do have

15

to interpret the federal law to win on this particular

16

statutory point.

17

MS. WELLING:

18

QUESTION:

That's absolutely correct.

You have to convince us that the federal

19

law forbad Pennsylvania from refusing to apply the 18-year

20

statute retroactive.

21
no

/. Z

23

MS. WELLING:

That is the heart of this argument,

Your Honor.
In this particular situation the statute of

24

limitations as contained in the federal statute, the

25

requirement of this 18-year statute is framed in mandatory

8

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

language.

It is one of the four sections of 666 which is

•■)

required on the states, but which specifically is not included

3

in the number of requirements that a state is allowed to

4

request a waiver from the Secretary of HHS.
So the structure of the statute underlines the fact

5
6

of the mandatory and clear language of the statute itself.

7

the statute to say it requires the state have in effect

0

procedures which permit the establishment of paternity of any

9

child at any time,

the House report that accompanied the bill

10

in the house talked about the fact that there were shorter

11

statutes of limitations in the various jurisdictions.

12

For

Remember that this congressional decision to pass

13

this statute follows hard on the heels of the Pickett v.

14

decision and the Mills v. Habluetzel decisions which had

15

invalidated a one- and a two-year statute of limitations.

16

was in

The congressional debate about this was taking place

18

in

that there are these shorter statutes of limitations out there.

The House report,

paternity past the child's second,

The legislative history here is clear that Congress

was thinking about children who were already past the statutory

limits in their particular states.

"Since it is clear the

retroactively to children who were already born at the time

this statute was in effect, to children who may already have

19

individual jurisdiction.

-- and other constitutional aspects to it?
That is precisely correct.

That this

the Pennsylvania Supreme Court,

is in conflict with the federal

child support enforcement amendments.

11

And only if this Court does not reach that issue,

then before this Court will be the question of the equal

Because she will be barred by the six-

2

QUESTION:

Yes, but if the statute is invalid on

equal protection grounds --

3

MS. WELLING:

4

QUESTION:

5

Correct.

-- why is that a barrier?

Therefore, I

don't follow your "only if" argument.

6

MS. WELLING:

Maybe I should just restate it.

7

The six-year statute is clearly invalid on equal

8

protection grounds.

9

classification based on --

10
11
12

QUESTION:

This Court has repeatedly held that a

Before you get to the equal protection,

let me ask you one more question about the statute.
Would it not comply with the federal statute for

13

Pennsylvania to say today, well, we're wrong in saying the six-

14

year statute bars the action completely, but we will now allow

15

the procedure to go forward to permit the establishment of the

16

paternity of the child, but now allow any retroactive recovery

17

before the paternity is established?

18

literally with the federal statute?

Wouldn't that comply

19

Do you understand my question?

20

MS. WELLING:

21

I think that if Pennsylvania said we will allow the

Yes, I understand your question.

22

paternity to be decided, then Pennsylvania procedure would

23

carry the rest of the was, because once paternity had been

24

decided her support --

25

QUESTION:

But that would be a matter of Pennsylvania

14

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

law is what I'm -- it would comply with the federal statute for

2

them to say, well, I guess we do have to, in order to comply

3

literally because the language is very strong as you say,

4

they'll say, well, I guess we cannot apply our six-year statute

5

to prevent you from establishing your paternity, but we may

6

apply the six-year statute to prevent you from recovering any

7

support money for the period before you establish paternity.

8

9

It seems to me that would be consistent with the
statute, and that wouldn't satisfy you.

Then you would still

10

say, well, I guess I want to go ahead with my equal protection

11

argument anyway.

12

MS. WELLING:

13

QUESTION:

14

MS. WELLING:

That's correct.

Yes.
And the equal protection argument is

15

based on the fact that there has been this differentiation

16

between the rights accorded marital children as opposed to the

17

rights accorded non-marital children in order to establish

18

support against their parents.

19

This Court has frequently spoken of the problems that

20

the historic discrimination against illegitimate children have

21

caused and the belief that it's unfair to punish illegitimate

22

children for the acts or the conduct of their parents.

23

Pennsylvania has justified this discrimination solely

24

in terms of the desire to meet problems of state proof and

25

fraudulent claims.

In Astemborski v. Susmarski, a case which

15

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

was remanded from this Court in order for Pennsylvania to

2

consider the six-year statute of limitations in light of the

3

Pickett and Mills cases.

4

In that case Pennsylvania -- the Supreme Court said

5

very clearly that the reason for this six-year statute of

6

limitations is only to prevent stale and fraudulent claims,

7

that it's only a question of proof problems.

8
9

Nevertheless,

in Pennsylvania, there are numerous

paternity determinations which Pennsylvania allows now and has

10

allowed in the past which permit paternity determinations to go

11

on at any time after a child's birth without any worry on

12

Pennsylvania's part about whether or not these present problems

13

of state proof or fraudulent claims.

14

For instance,

if a father wants to come forward and

15

have a child's birth certificate amended to add his name,

16

can bring an action to do that.

17

if the child is 17 or the child is 2.

18

get custody of a child and he is --

QUESTION:

20

MS. WELLING:

QUESTION:

It doesn't make any difference

By the child?

Yes.

Well,

I mean there is no problem if

nobody is worried about the paternity.

And so in order to

MS. WELLING:

3

QUESTION:

Yes, I believe that's right.

Are there any cases to come down of what

4

interests me in particular, is there any situation in which a

living individual can be held by a court to have fathered an

that has the anomalous result that --

In an action where the father is

MR. MCCLEAN:

Connell was 1984.

stated that Pennsylvania exists and somehow treats illegitimate

15

children differently from legitimate children routinely.

16

Petitioner has

In the Connell case, in those other cases that deal

17

with married parents raising the issue of paternity, they do so

18

in a circumstance where a woman would claim support for the

19

child, and there would be a mere answer, a denial of paternity.

20

The question at that point is ordering of blood tests.

21

is no specific limitation on the ordering of blood tests in

22

Pennsylvania.

In the Connell case, what happened was that two boys

24

were at issue initially.

25

What happened then was the support case didn't go on.

One was excluded; the other wasn't.

look at those, what Pennsylvania does, because in the case

7

where we are dealing with married people, you don't get to the

paternity statute.

QUESTION:

What Pennsylvania does is it puts -You don't, but the effect -- surely, the

in

effect on the woman in that case is just as horrendous as the

u

effect, if not worse, than the effect upon the man in a

1 2

paternity case.

13

You are saying in those cases the woman, if the

14

father establishes non-paternity, is in effect judged to have

15

committed adultery and had these children as a result of an

16

adultery relationship, right?

QUESTION:

Is there a six-year statute on that?

23

MR. MCCLEAN:

What was specifically stated in the

24

Petitioner's brief was that provided that the putative father

25

is not barred by laches or estoppel, and in each one of these

36

Heritage Reporting Corporation

628-4888

1

cases the father was barred by laches or estoppel prior to the

2

period of time that would have been represented by the six-

3

year statute.
In the specific case, seven years later when Mr.

4
5

Connell came in again, the court said, you waited too long.

6

And in the uniform -- the Uniform Blood Testing Act that

7

Pennsylvania has adopted, it specifically states that blood

8

testing should be done as soon as possible after the birth of

9

the child.

QUESTION:

But now, wait.

That laches defense, I

1.1

assume that means that the father had reason to know of the

12

illegitimacy of the children, and did nothing about it for a

13

lengthy period, so that's laches.

14

But you acknowledge that --

15

MR. MCCLEAN:

16

No, this is not illegitimate -- this is

between wedded parents.

17

Are you speaking with respect to the child who has --

children.

Pennsylvania doesn't care about that.

What we have to do is we have to look at what is in
the nature of a defense when the issue of paternity is raised.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

Marriage certainly is the counterpoint to -- in the

2

illegitimate situation between unwedded people, the access,

3

non-access, the continuing relationship.

4

Pennsylvania what we say is that there is a rebuttable

5

presumption of paternity in the case where people are married.

6

That's how we treat it differently.

That's why in

But to say that Pennsylvania does not post any

7

8

barrier to a wedded parent as opposed to an unwedded parent is

9

not true.

10

So too with respect to the case where the unwedded

11

father can lodge an action.

12

unwedded father not being the custodian, not being the

13

guardian, not being the next friend, could not come into the

14

court under the paternity statute and establish the paternity

15

for the ability to have some kind of visitation rights, or to

16

establish inheritance rights.

The case had risen because the

raised was that the Pennsylvania Superior Court gave the father

the rights to come in under the Pennsylvania Declaratory
