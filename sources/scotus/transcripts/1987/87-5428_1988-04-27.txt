There are four or five things that I think I should disabuse

of any notion that may have been suggested by counsel

22

concerning this particular inmate, and this particular record.

MR. SMITH:

Why wouldn't Fallen cover it then?

Well, because I think Fallen is a criminal case,

first of all, and as a criminal case there are no congressionally

set deadlines, filing deadlines.

Suppose we reject that argument and say that Fallen
