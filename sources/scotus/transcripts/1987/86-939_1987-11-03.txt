MR. MINEAR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Interior may enter

into a contract pursuant to the federal

reclamation laws to supply a portion of the program's unneeded

17

irrigation waters for ETSI Pipeline Project's state-approved

18

industrial use.

19

I would like to begin by briefly describing the Pick-

20

Sloan Plan. Pick-Sloan represents a comprehensive yet flexible

21

response to the needs of a vast and varied river basin.

22

combines the flood control features of the Army's proposed Pick

What is

it the same water we're talking about?

19

MR. MINEAR:

MR. MINEAR:

Not necessarily.
Could it be?

Could it be the same?

Usually not. For instance, I would think

Because it is being put to a use by the

2

Interior Department. It's being put to a use in accordance with

3

the federal reclamation laws.

4

QUESTION:

Am I mistaken then in thinking that the

5

Corps has changed its position so it now believes that it could

6

have marketed the water in this case as surplus water?
MR.

7

MINEAR:

I believe the Army's present position,

8

which is presently being formulated at this point, it is still

9

under evolution, would be that it would not be able to market

10

the ETSI water, and the reason is this:

11

to 1974.

let me go back, first,

12

The Army made a determination at that point that it

13

probably could not market unutilized irrigation water in these

14

circumstances because it would run through the hydro-powered

15

turbines and would,

that's nice, but what does surplus

I thought it meant spill-over.
MINEAR:

Traditionally,

that's how the Army

defined it.

Water that would, in fact, pass over the spillway,

that would not be used for any other purpose.

MR. MINEAR:

He has no authority under the provision

MR. MINEAR:

Yes, that is correct.
Even if the Army decided

that

it had
