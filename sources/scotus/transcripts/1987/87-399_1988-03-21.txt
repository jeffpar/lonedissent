ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY E. LUCYK, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

9
10

MR. LUCYK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

11

This is a very important case with a very ironic

12

twist.

13

under interstate privileges and immunities grounds against

14

the Virginia Supreme Court rule which is intended to

15

promote the interstate mobility of experienced attorneys

16

by providing them with a limited form of bar admission

17

without examination.

It's ironic because this case involves an attack

18

Presently Virginia is among the minority of

19

states with what you might call liberal bar admission

20

policies.

21

mobility of lawyers.

They provide no form of bar admission

22

without examination.

This is a vulcanization of the

23

legal profession, and this is a vulcanization which has

24

accelerated in recent years and, in fact, eight states

25

have dropped reciprocity admission since 1985 alone.

Twenty-eight states, in fact, limit interstate

1

This case is very important because it brings the

2

Court to a crossroads.

3

admission is sustained, the decision could hasten the trend

4

of the states toward exclusionary bar admission policies

5

and, in fact, thwart the principles of interstate harmony

6

underlying the privileges and immunities clause.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. LUCYK:

If this attack on reciprocity

Would that be bad?
Your Honor, the decision would, in

9

fact, defeat the purposes of the Constitutional provision.

10

It would be bad.

11

On the other hand, the decision upholding

12

Virginia's rule could reverse the current trend and

13

encourage the states to restore interstate mobility afforded

14

by reciprocity admission.

15

It is helpful first to focus on what is and

16

what is not before the Court.

17

Supreme Court of New Hampshire v. Piper.

18

restrict admission to the bar only to Virginia residents

19

and, in fact, the record in this case establishes that

20

13 percent of Virginia's 14,000 bar members are nonresidents

21

admitted by examination.

22

right of the states to require an applicant to prove

23

knowledge and competence in local law and to demonstrate a

24

commitment to providing service in the jurisdiction before

25

they may be admitted to the bar.

This is not a rerun of
Virginia does not

Nor is this a challenge of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

5
1

Finally, the Court need not address the right of

2

the states, as twenty-eight states do, to require all

3

applicants to take a bar examination or stand for an

4

examination to demonstrate this commitment and competence

5

in local law.

6

What is here is a very narrow issue and it is

7

the right of Virginia to provide an exception to the

8

general admission requirement of examination.

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Lucyk, now what do you say is the

10

main purpose that Virginia has in making the residence

11

requirement?

12

Virginia a requirement of full-time practice in Virginia

13

to be admitted on motion.

There is, as I understand it, already in

14

MR. LUCYK:

15

QUESTION:

That is correct, Justice O'Connor.
So what is there above and beyond

16

that that is Virginia's interest in the residence

17

requirement?

18

MR. LUCYK:

Virginia's interest in requiring

19

residence is to ensure that this is, in fact, a restricted

20

license to practice law.

21

form of general admission.

22

restrictions, whereas Virginia intends by its reciprocity

23

program to encourage lawyers, experienced lawyers, to

24

come into the state and provide their full-time

25

availability to the service of Virginia clients.

Admission by examination is a
It entails no long-term

Heritage Reporting Corporation

2

QUESTION:

The fact that they agree to work

full-time in Virginia is not enough to meet that?

3

MR. LUCYK:

Justice, the full-time practice

4

requirement serves to provide 9 to 5 availability, but it

5

does not promote availability of that attorney to Virginia

6

residents and Virginia clients beyond those normal office

7

hours.

8

That is the function of residence.
QUESTION:

Is there any state bar requirement

9

that a lawyer give a certain amount of pro bono service or

10

have an office open beyond 5 o'clock, or something like that?
MR. LUCYK:

11

No, Justice O'Connor.

The Virginia

12

Supreme Court presumes that applicants admitted by

13

examination have demonstrated that commitment to the

14

practice of law in the state, that they will provide without

15

any requirement that commitment to providing pro bono

16

services and making their services available.
We do not believe we can presume that same

17
18

commitment from someone who is merely paying the annual

19

dues and making an annual promise.

QUESTION:

And practicing full-time in the

That is correct.
We are asking our practitioners admitted by

MR. LUCYK:

No, Your Honor, but that doesn't

defeat the purposes of the full-time practice rule which

16

in and of itself is intended to ensure that an attorney has

sufficient contacts with Virginia law on a consistent basis.

That may be the purpose, but is it

I don't know if that is true or not,

Your Honor.

9

QUESTION:

You must know some.

10

MR. LUCYK:

I do know of one.

I do.
I do know of one

11

and that was a gentleman who sued the Virginia Supreme Court

12

over the full-time practice requirement in 1985.

13

there are others, but I don't think the number is so great

14

that it is substantial or at least as a factor in this case.

QUESTION:

How does the Supreme Court of Virginia

police the full-time practice requirement.

MR. LUCYK:

Is it an easy

It is not, Mr. Chief Justice.

of that case.
QUESTION:

Were there other charges as well as

failing to practice --

21

MR. LUCYK:

22

QUESTION:

I believe there may have been.
So, as far as you know, nobody has

23

ever been disbarred simply because they practiced

24

somewhere else?

25

MR. LUCYK:

No, Your Honor, and, frankly, there

Heritage Reporting Corporation

haven't been that many attorneys who have been admitted by

2

this rule up to that time.

3

QUESTION:

What about the residence requirement?

4

How long -- say, the person lives in a hotel over in

5

Arlington and at the time of making application gets the

6

certificate and then moves to Maryland.

7

about that?

8

MR. LUCYK:

That individual would be out of

compliance with the rule and would be subject to revocation.

What do you do

QUESTION:

Has anybody ever had their license

revoked for moving from Virginia to Maryland?

12

MR. LUCYK:

I'm not aware if there have been,

13

Your Honor, and, again, the numbers in the past haven't

14

been that great that compliance has posed great problems.

15

QUESTION:

Why is that?

That surprises me.

16

You may have noticed there are a lot of lawyers in

17

Washington, D.C., and a fair number of them live in

18

Virginia.

19

as counsel for a government agency, for example, or on the

20

staff of a government agency would not constitute the

21

regular practice of law in Virginia.

22

of lawyers.

23

And I would assume that practicing in Washington

MR. LUCYK:

There must be a lot

It would not, Justice Scalia.

And

there are quite a few lawyers who reside in the area and

who practice up here who take the Virginia Bar examination.
Heritage Reporting Corporation

There are a significant number, in fact.

our bar members are nonresidents admitted by examination, so

it's certainly a reasonable and adequate alternative which

4

is available.

QUESTION:

Nearly 2,000 of

Now, once they are admitted by

6

examination they do not have to engage in the regular

7

practice of law in Virginia?
MR. LUCYK:

8

That's correct.

Once they have

passed the examination, they've demonstrated their competence

10

in local law and they have certainly established, or shown

a commitment, to a substantial practice in the jurisdiction.

And after examination, they can move

out of the state, too.
MR. LUCYK:

18

Yes, sir, Justice.

We can presume,

19

and this Court has made clear: you can presume that in

20

real life no one is going to take the bar exam unless they

21

intend to make a substantial commitment to practice in the

22

state.
QUESTION:

23

Well, they intend to practice in

24

Virginia.

The only thing is they change their mind after

a couple of years and join a firm in another state.

of sense.

16

when you view the purposes of the rule as a whole, and that

17

is to encourage lawyers to move and provide services not

18

just in the border areas of Virginia but all over the state,

19

in the southern and western mountains, in the Piedmont

20

region, on the Eastern Shore.

21

The purpose of the rule, and the rule was

22

adopted, to make it easier for older practitioners to move

23

into the state and to establish a practice, maybe those

24

who have to move because of some change in their personal

25

or professional commitments.

Do you really think this law attracts

Do you

I think the law provides that purpose.
Does it do it?

Does it attract them?

10

Because my next question is how many has it attracted

11

so far?

12

MR. LUCYK:

Justice, I have no empirical evidence

13

to show how many lawyers may have been attracted to

14

particular areas of the state, but I do know that, for

purpose.

20

You know, the rule does serve that beneficial

So, in effect, we view waiver of the examination

21

as an incentive to give lawyers the opportunity to come

22

into the state and devote their full time and make their

23

availability to the practice of law and the service of

24

Virginia clients.

25

a bridge which actually promotes interstate mobility.

In that sense, the rule, we submit, is

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

14
1

It's a bridge across state lines and it is a bridge which is

2

not provided by twenty-eight other states which require all

3

practitioners to take the bar examination.

4

QUESTION:

Yes, but it still would perform that

5

function if you knocked out the feature of the rule that

6

they challenge.

7

MR. LUCYK:

Justice Stevens, I think the problem

8

is that it would not perform that function to the extent

9

the Virginia Supreme Court would like it to because, again,

10

we are talking about an attorney's commitment to full-time

11

availability.

12

the area, and goes to a distant location in another state

13

is not going to be available to the same extent as someone

14

who resides directly in the community and is available for

15

a visit in the evening.

16

And someone who leaves the state, who leaves

The other thing that the residence requirement

17

does in terms of aiding in the enforcement, or at least

18

compliance with full-time practice, is it ensures that the

19

attorney's social contacts and community contacts aren't

20

going to bring that attorney additional business.

21

Now, if our attorney who resides in Vienna,

22

Virginia, you know, has social contacts, meets people on

23

weekends and the evenings, people who ask legal questions

24

and need services, and the attorney says, sure, come on

25

into my office and we'll talk about it, that attorney is

who is meeting with his or her social contacts in the

4

evenings or on the weekends, who are Maryland residents, and

5

these are persons who are saying, look, I've got this legal

6

problem, come on in to my office, well, then we see an

7

expanding or growing out-of-state practice which defeats the

8

purpose of full-time practice.

Whereas our attorney in Cheverly, Maryland,

QUESTION:

Well, I certainly want to congratulate

10

Virginia on wanting to get more lawyers in this way.

11

certainly is that most states seem to think they have too

many, and you're describing this as really a device to

13

bring in as many lawyers as possible.

16

It

I thought we were arguing about an exclusionary
aspect of it, not an inclusionary aspect of it.
MR. LUCYK:

Well, Justice, I think our point

17

here is that that you've got to look at the rule as a whole

18

and what is it intended to do.

19

narrow focus, and if you look at it from the eyes of

20

someone who thinks there should be no restrictions in

21

each state for admission to the bar, then it may appear to

22

be exclusionary.

23

Twenty-two doesn't say too much to me.

MR. LUCYK:

So the numbers really are, I think,

more in favor of our position and if these seven states

abolish reciprocity then we are looking at no more than

19

fifteen, a handful of states which still include reciprocity.

20

The other point that we would like to make is

21

that discretionary admission without examination has been

22

subject to further Constitutional attacks on a regular

basis involving these so-called interstate harmony

So we may see full-time practice

We may also see the requirement of reciprocity

disappear, because it is, indeed, a reciprocity program.

restrictions of full-time practice and residence if he moved

from Florida.

5

would not be eligible?

MR. LUCYK:

He or she

Justice Stevens, let me articulate one

7

reason why I think, you know -- the presumption seems to be

8

in this day and age that if there is any condition which

9

limits admission to the bar it must be the product of

10

economic protectionism.

11

But there is another very valid reason for a bar,

12

a state bar, wanting to maintain a reasonable and

13

controllable size of the bar it is required to regulate.

14

And by the 1990s, there will be one million practicing

15

attorneys in this country.

16

a bar-regulating authority to have to consider, even if

17

just ten percent of those attorneys seek admission to the

18

bar by reciprocity, regulating a bar of 100,000 attorneys

19

or even more, especially for a bar like Virginia which has

20

only 14,000 attorneys at this time.

21

all of the potential misconduct problems that could arise.

22

Indeed, most of the states now have great backlogs in

23

their disciplinary proceedings because they simply cannot

keep up with the numbers.

25

It's a staggering thought for

And trying to regulate

But not only regulating misconduct problems, but

QUESTION:

Well, I think that all makes good

sense, but I would suppose that is directed at the distinction

between reciprocity states and nonreciprocity states, just

as in the same way that you might say we'll only take

lawyers whose names begin with A through M.

8

would serve the same purpose.

MR. LUCYK:

Because that

Justice, it certainly may serve the

10

same purpose, but we submit here that Virginia's rule does

11

achieve a number of very laudable purposes.

12

It does open the doors to reciprocity for and

13

grant a right of travel to non-resident attorneys, so they

14

may come into the state and engage in the practice of law.

15

At the same time, it still ensures a guarantee

16

of competence and commitment from those attorneys.

17

submit that the Virginia rule does achieve a balance, a good

18

balance, from the complete exclusion that was presented,

19

for instance, in the Piper case, and from the unregulated,

uncontrollable bar which might exist if there were no

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CORNISH F. HITCHCOCK, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE
MR. HITCHCOCK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

it may it please the Court:
There are two ways that a lawyer may be admitted

7

to the Virginia Bar.

8

the bar examination which is administered twice a year and

9

which is available to all applicants who meet certain

10

educational and character requirements.

11

is the one at issue here and it allows lawyers to be

12

admitted without taking the bar examination if they meet

13

three requirements: first, they have been licensed for a

14

least five years by a state which extends the same

15

opportunity to Virginia lawyers; second, they are willing

16

to comply with the full-time practice requirement; and,

17

third, they are permanent residents of Virginia.

18

add that these are ongoing requirements, that one may be

19

liable to expulsion from the Virginia Bar if a motion

20

applicant moves out of the state or ceases to practice

21

there on a full-time basis.

The residency requirement that is the focus of

that it helps to assure compliance with the full-time

practice rule.
If I may, at this point, I'd like to respond to a

point Mr. Lucyk made in resonse to Justice O'Connor's

question about after hours availability.

available after 5 o'clock or that that's one of the

purposes of why the rule is in effect.

Before discussing the privileges and immunities

clause legal issues, I'd like to make a comment on the

3

facts here which might help put the issue in perspective

4

and show how unconnected residence is with the goals that

5

the state is advancing.

6

Ms. Friedman began work with her current

7

employer in Virginia in January of 1986.

8

she was living in Virginia and qualified for admission on

9

motion under Rule 1(a)(1).

10

that the next month she got married and moved to her

11

husband's home in Maryland.

12

married then, she had waited a year, had been admitted on

13

motion.

14

she wanted to move into her husband's home in Maryland,

15

she had to chose between facing the possiblity of some

16

expulsion or disciplinary action under Rule 1(a)(3) or

17

else sitting down and taking the full Virginia Bar

18

examination.

19

At that time,

The problem in her situation is

Suppose instead of getting

While the situation may not be universal, I

20

suggest it illustrates one way in which this rule does not

21

advance the goals that the Commonwealth suggests.

QUESTION:

Is that such a terrific hardship

23

to sit down and take the Virginia Bar?

I mean that's

24

really what this all comes down to, that she just doesn't

she is who are making the same commitment.

Let me, since you bring it up, illustrate that

it does impose a hardship.

in order for the examination to be administered.

here again we are dealing with experienced lawyers who

the state is willing to say we will excuse you from this

applicant such as Ms. Friedman who has made exactly the

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Hitchcock, at least one

state, rather one court, the Seventh Circuit, I believe,
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

28
1

has held in a very similar situation that the right to be

2

admitted to practice on motion just isn't a fundamental

3

privilege, protected under the privileges and immunities

4

clause.

5

6

Isn't that right?
MR. HITCHCOCK:

Let me address that.

The court,

before it got to that point â€”

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. HITCHCOCK:

In the Sestric case.
The Sestric case, yes.

The

9

Sestric case was distinguishable first of all because it

10

held that the clause doesn't apply because the universe of

11

people being advantaged are new residents of Illinois and

12

the people being discriminated against were old Illinois

13

residents as well as non-residents.

14

between residents versus non-residents, the court said

15

that the clause does not apply for that reason.

Finding no symmetry

16

That is not the situation here.

17

QUESTION:

18
19

I think the court also had the view

that admission on motion just isn't a fundamental privilege.
MR. HITCHCOCK:

That was an additional point

20

which they discussed.

But, here, the distinction that was

21

made here, and I think in Sestric as well, is that as long

22

as a state gives you some opportunity to get a license,

23

that it is free to impose preferential or discriminatory

24

conditions even if, as in this case, they would be run

25

afoul of the Constitution.
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

29
1

It's like an unconstitutional condition that

2

the court has recognized in other cases, that even if a

3

state has no obligation to give a certain gratuitous

4

benefit to people it still must grant that benefit in a

5

manner that's consisistent with the Constitution.

6

QUESTION:

Well, if admission on motion is not

7

a fundamental privilege, then there's nothing unconstitutional

8

about imposing that condition.

9

MR. HITCHCOCK:

If it were, but I think that

10

you have to focus on what Piper held.

11

consistent with a number of earlier cases, that it is the

12

opportunity to practice law that is at issue.

13

specifically, in Toomer, in Austin, the court said the

14

inquiry is whether out-of-state residents are being treated

15

on terms of substantial equality with non-residents.

16

Have state residents demanded for themselves a benefit

17

which is not being extended to equally qualified

18

non-residents.

19

Piper said,

More

That's precisely the situation here.

Virginia residents have the opportunity to be

20

admitted in a very efficient and inexpensive manner,

21

indeed, almost a risk-free manner and that option is

22

simply denied to out-of-state residents.

23

I think the problem with the argument that's

24

advanced by the state and in Sestric is the assumption

25

that the clause only applies if lawyers are totally

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

30

1

excluded from the bar, if out-of-staters are totally excluded

2

from a certain privilege.

3

This Court has never held that.

I think this

4

case is closest to the cases involving commercial licenses

5

where a state has said we will let out-of-staters in but

6

we are simply going to charge them a higher licensing fee.

7

Now, there may be no fundamental right to pursue a certain

8

occupation.

9

state may say that we are going to put such and such type

11

allow no one the opportunity.

12

to allow someone to pursue their professional career in

13

the state, they must make it available on terms of

14

substantial equality to residents as well as non-residents.

15

In the fishermen cases, for example, the

But once they make a decision

To follow up on Justice Scalia's earlier

16

question, there just is not that term of substantial

17

equality here, to make lawyers, as a practical matter,

18

take time away from their existing practice to review

19

courses they may not have examined since they were in

20

law school and probably are not going to be practicing

21

in their practice in Virginia, to have to wait for ten or

22

eleven months to be admitted through the exam process

23

when lawyers can be admitted on four months by examination,

24

to have basically a risk-free way of getting into the

25

bar as opposed to the risk that any lawyer faces upon

Indeed, I would suggest, for experienced lawyers

that risk may be particularly greater.

that that lawyer may not have addressed since he or she

was in law school and must bone up on them and risk the

Indeed, in this case, for exam applicants there is a

differential that is directly related to that cost.

residents but who have to take the examination.

yes, because there are important practical consequences if

MR. HITCHCOCK:

The answer, Justice Scalia, is

that this Court has required a heightened form of scrutiny

opportunities, but they do provide opportunities if the

consideration is closely tailored.

response to the Chief Justice's question, if somebody wants

to take the examination but lives out of the state and

cannot be examined by a local character committee, he may

be able to charge them a little bit more money to have

If I may, I'd like to turn now to the specific

20

rationales that the Appellants have raised in defense of

22

The first rationale is that it promotes a

lawyer's commitment to Virginia.

My initial comment is

I'm not really sure what that means.

reformulation of the arguments which the Court rejected

anticipate a considerable practice there, unless they are

9

willing to take on the burden of paying bar dues and

10

continuing legal education requirements, and any pro bono

requirements, anything else that the state may seek to

impose.

I think there was a very

So that is why, we would suggest, that the

3

arguments about commitment which the Court rejected in

Piper apply with equal force in the context of motion

5

admissions, regardless of whether there's a lesser burden

footnote to that â€” true, I think, in states where lawyers

seek to practice on a multi-state basis.

Lawyers are not

Even if the Court were not willing to stop there

19

and say that these reasons â€” the argument is not

20

sufficiently substantial â€” there is an additional factor

21

here that is unique to Virginia that I think should lay

22

to rest any doubts about the validity or invalidity of

23

the residence requirement.

24
25

I'm speaking specifically about the full-time
practice rule.

If Virginia may validly seek to say that

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

40

all laywers admitted on motion must commit themselves to

2

full-time practice in the state, then the residency

3

requirement becomes, as the Fourth Circuit says, redundant.

4

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Hitchcock, what do you understand

is meant by the full-time practice requirement?
MR. HITCHCOCK:

The only interpretation that the

7

Supreme Court of Virginia has provided is in the Titus

8

case, which we cite in Footnote 2 of our brief, which is

9

that a lawyer must have an office in Virginia and must

10

practice there on a, quote, regular, unquote, basis.

11

The court -- that's a 1972 or 1973 decision â€”

12

has not construed it since then.

13

equate with full-time but I'm not sure about what would

14

happen if lawyers did other things, even if they were

15

living in Virginia, if they wanted to do things other than

16

practice law forty hours a week, thirty-five hours a week,

17

or whatever it may be.

18

more specific guidance and there are no disciplinary

19

opinions or other rulings that provide clearer guidance

20

on this point.

21

22
23

QUESTION:

Regular, they apparently

The court has not provided any

Mr. Hitchcock, do you think the

full-time practice requirement is Constitutional?
MR. HITCHCOCK:

Your Honor, in cander we

24

argued in Goldfarb v. Supreme Court of Virginia that the

25

full-time practice requirement was invalid under the
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

41
1

commerce clause.
QUESTION:

2

If that's an invalid requirement, how

3

can it be a substitute for protection for what the state

4

seeks to protect here?
MR. HITCHCOCK:

5

Well, as I indicated in the

6

earlier point, I think the Court could stop just by saying â€”

7

by following Piper in saying that one's commitment to

8

Virginia is sufficiently assured without regard to whether

9

or not there's a full-time practice requirement.
QUESTION:

10
11

You mean by the mere fact that your

client applied for admission?
MR. HITCHCOCK:

12

That's enough?

The fact that she applied for

13

admission and the fact that she was willing to do anything

14

that Virginia seeks to ask her short of full-time practice

15

would be enough here.
QUESTION:

resolution of this case, multi-state practice is the sort

of thing which I think states should be encouraging.

15

Chesterfield Smith, the former American Bar Association

16

president, noted in an article which the Court cited with

17

approval in Piper, as lawyers get older and more experienced

18

the demand for their services across state lines increases

19

and restrictions which limit their ability to practice

20

really disserve the public and disserve the clients who

21

may need and wish to retain their services.

22

QUESTION:

As

Yes, but as you develop that argument

23

what do you say about the state's position that really

24

what's going to happen here is that the states are all

25

going to start requiring bar exams and that will make the
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

43
1
2
3
4

problem even more acute?
MR. HITCHCOCK:

Well, my answer is that -- two

answers to that.
First of all, there's no case of which I am aware

5

involving discriminatory or preferential treatments where

6

any court has tried to predict what's going to happen.

7

a preferential law is struck down, a state has two choices:

8

they can make the benefit available to everyone or they

9

can make it available to no one.

10

certainly, that a reviewing court or reviewing judge should

11

say: what is the state likely to do?

12

constitute sound public policy in my mind and, therefore,

13

I'm going to uphold the Constitutionality or strike down

14

the Constitutionality based on that prediction.

15

QUESTION:

When

This Court has never held,

Does that result

But it's very rare that the whole

16

reason for an individual's asking us to strike it down is the

17

same reason that would be frustrated by one of the courses

18

that the state might take.

19

ironic about this case.

20

upon us is to enable freer commerce between the states in

21

legal services.

22

you are going to achieve, if we hold the way you want, is

23

to reduce that freedom rather than increase it.

24
25

That's what seems, to me,

The very reason you're urging this

And it's quite possible that the result

MR. HITCHCOCK:

It may be a possibility but

that's a risk involving any kind of preferential law.

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

44
1

There are also, I think, corrective mechanisms.

2

people who are injured if this provision were to be

3

withdrawn are not only lawyers from out of the states, but

4

Virginia law firms who may want to make it easier to

5

recruit lawyers, and may be willing to say to the Virginia

6

Supreme Court or the legislature which created this option

7

in the first place: we'd like the opportunity, it's really

8

difficult because everyone has to take the bar exam, would

9

you consider some kind of waiver of the exam for people,

10

without regard to the fact that they may chose to live

11

outside the state.

12

I mean, the

There are other corrective mechanisms but, again,

13

regardless of the ironies, if an institution decides to

14

close down or no longer make certain benefits available

15

because it has to admit other people, that's not an

16

argument that it's Constitutional or valid or should be

17

upheld.

18

It's the Court's function, I would respectfully

19

submit, to apply the law here and to let the consequences

20

be decided based upon what the Court's ruling is.

21

even if the Court does, if the full-time practice rule

22

remains in effect â€” although as I indicated in response

23

to Justice Stevens, there are problems with that â€” that

24

should be enough to satisfy the goals that the state seeks

25

to achieve with respect to assuring a compliance, competence,
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

And here,

45
1

whatever else.

2

by the fact that Virginia has no enforcement mechanism and

3

the notion that without the residence requirement lawyers

4

would be likely to set up sham residences is equally likely

5

as the prospect that they will set up sham offices, which

6

they're likely to do.

7

I think that specific argument is undercut

It might be said, ironically enough, if there are

8

ironies in this case, the people who this rule keeps out

9

now are those lawyers who cannot in good conscience say:

10

I'm willing to practice full-time, I live in Virginia.

11

The lawyers who are allowed in under the rule may be those

12

who don't honor their professional commitments to the same

13

as someone like Ms. Friedman.

14

15

or living in other states.

16

enforcement mechanism may be keeping out the people who

17

can serve Virginia clients well, allowing in those who are

18

not doing the sort of things Virginia seeks of people who

19

want to be admitted on motion.

In the remaining time, I'd like to take a moment
to talk about the other arguments.
If the Court should decide that the privileges

23

and immunities clause doesn't apply here, as some of the

24

questions have indicated, we still submit that the

25

judgement should be invalidated under the equal protection
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

46
1

clause, that there is no rational basis for holding that

2

where a lawyer lives promotes compliance with the rule or

3

promotes one's commitment to the jurisdiction.

4

In recent terms, the Court has struck down under

5

that rational basis test some preferential tax laws which

6

sought to give preferences to state residents vis-a-vis

7

non-residents: the Court found that that effort to give

8

the hometeam an advantage, as it said in one case, was not

rationally connected to the goals which were advanced.

Vermont.

citizens of other states who bought a car in, say, New York,

10

paid the tax there, came into Vermont and had to pay the

11

tax again.

That was an exemption.

It's a benefit â€”

The Court there rejected the justifications that

were offered about what amounted to a higher burden on

14

state residents, Vermont residents, vis-a-vis out-of-state

residents.

would be invalid under the commerce clause for some of

the reasons that I suggested earlier in colloquy with

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS - REBUTTAL

MR. LUCYK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

If it

please the Court:
I'd first like to respond to something that

6

Justice White said during my -- Appellee's argument here, and

7

that is that you expressed concern that if the Appellee

8

were required to take the bar examination she wouldn't be

9

able to work for six or seven months.

10

That is simply not true.

The bar examination is

11

only a two-day examination and the bar review course that

12

is offered for that occurs in the evening hours.

13

the Appellee could apply for the bar examination in May,

14

take the bar review course, take the exam at the end of

15

July, and she'd admitted to the Virginia Bar by October.

MR. LUCYK;

She could not hang out her shingle

MR. LUCYK:

Heritage Reporting Corporation

If you apply for the bar exam in May and are admitted in

October, that four to five month period is the same period

of time that it takes for someone to apply for reciprocity,

to have the papers processed by the National Conference of

So, we're not talking about a difference in time commitment.

There's no question, and we're not going to deny,

that the bar examination imposes a burden.

our restricted license by reciprocity also imposes a burden

On the other hand, the reciprocity rule imposes
