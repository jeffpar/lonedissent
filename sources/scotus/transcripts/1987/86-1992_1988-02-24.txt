ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBFRT H. KLONOFF, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the

10

issue in this case is whether the Ninth Circuit was correct

11

in ordering citizenship for the 16 respondents, all

12

Philippine veterans of World War Two, under a statute that

13

expired in • 1946.

14

We submit that this Court has already answered

15

that question in 1973 in INS versus Hibi .

16

held that the Attornev General's action in withdrawing the

17

vice consul, from the Philippines and the government's failure

18

to publicize the nroaram did not qive rise to an equitable

19

basis for disregarding the December 31st, 1946, cutoff, and

20

as I will explain during this argument, respondent's argument

21

is nothing more than a change of label.

22

argument made in this case is identical to that rejected in

23

Hibi .

24
25

The Court in Hibi

The substantive

We further submit that Hibi was correctlv decided
and that there is no basis for this Court to overrule it.
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

3

1

To begin with, the relief ordered by the Ninth

2

Circuit in this case is foreclosed by four naturalization

3

statutes in addition to the 1946 cutoff in Hibi, and as I

4

will explain, those statutes prohibit a court from orderina

5

citizenship under the expired and repealed 1940 Act even as

6

to those situations in which there was a timely application

7

under the 1940 Act that was still pendina and had not been

8

ruled upon, and we submit that these naturalization statutes

9

are dispositive for two reasons.

10

First, as this Court made clear in Fedorenko and

11

indeed as early as the Ginsberg case, a court has no eauitable

12

authority to disregard statutory requirements for citizenship

13

and more generally the Court of Appeals' invocation of its

14

eguitable authoritv in violation of statutory mandate is in

IS

fact an abuse of equitable authority.

16

established that a court of equity may not order relief that

17

is contrary to the leqislative intent.

18

Fe sumbit it is well

In addition, it is our position that the underlviha

19

premise of the Court of Appeals opinion is false.

20

view the Attornev General's actions were entirely lawful and

21

were within his discretion under the 19^0 Act, and as I will

22

explain, that is true cor three reasons.

23

In our

First, faction 7n5 of the Act left it to the

24

attorney General to decide where to "'lace examiners, when

25

to Place them, and for how lonq.

In addition, the decision

1

in this case, the revocation of the vice consul's authority

2

was based on bona fide foreign policy concerns, and as this

3

Court has made clear in numerous cases cited in the crovern-

4

ment's briefs, a high degree of judicial deference must be

5

given in the context of executive foreign policy decisions, and

6

that applies a fortiori.

decisions four decades later.

8

The Court is reviewing those

In addition, there is added discretion in this case

9

because there is no evidence whatsoever that Congress dis­

12

only confirm that the Attorney General acted lawfullv in what

QUESTION:

In fact, as we have

And you say that despite the languaae

of the statute.
MR. KLONOFF:
Absolutely.

The languaae of the '40 Act, voumean?

First of all, as we have explained in our brief,

18

it is anything but clear whether that statute was intended to

19

appl^ to individuals who enlisted or were inducted in the

20

Philippines, arid the Attorney General had to answer a number

21

of difficult issues before he even determined that it applied

22

there, particularly in the context-of the Philippine

23

Commonwealth Army.

24

intended to authorize the naturalization 6^ some guarter of

25

QUESTION:

We have naturalized a lot of them, though,

over there, didn't we?
MR. KLONOFF: We did, that's true, and in fact that

4

serves to undermine

5

something invideous about what was being done.

6

confirms that the decision was made for legitimate foreign

7

policy reasons, but going beyond that, Justice Blackmun, the

8

statute as described by the eight dissenting iustices below

9

is completely or>en ended. There is no mandate that the

10

Attorney General place an examiner in any particular location

11

or for any particular period of time.

12

discretion, and as we have pointed out in our brief, the three-

13

month period in which an examiner was actually placed in the

J4

Philippines before his authority was revoked compares quite

IS

favorably and is perhaps comparable to the post to post

16

rotation system that was employed elsewhere in the world.

respondent' sargument that there was
That only

It is left up to his

17

So ultimately it may be in fact that these respon­

18

dents and others similarly situated had as much access to an

19

examiner as soldiers elsewhere in the world, so we don't think

20

there is anything in the statute that compelled the Attorney

21

General to leave an examiner there, and indeed we submit it

22

was-entirely within his discretion to do what he did.

23

And again, I would point out that the subseauent

24

Congressional statutes only confirm that.

25

while the statute was still in effect, we'have Congress passinc

We have in 19^6,

a statute indicating that membership in the Philippine

Commonwealth Army does not constitute membership in the

3

United States armed forces . That directly contradicts the

4

Ninth Circuit's assumption that the plain

5

statute compelled the Attorney General to apply the program

6

in the Philippines.

7

readinq of the

12

ever that this program was intended to apply in the

13

Dhilippines, and we challenged respondents to cite anything

14

in the lecrislative history either to show that the proaram was

initially intended to apply in the Dhilippines or some

16

recognition on the part of Congress that the Attorney General

17

had erred or enaaged in misconduct, and thev have not cited

18

any, so we would submit in light of that complete absence of

19

anything by Congress to contradict what the Attorney General

20

did and aiven the foreign policy concerns that were the basis

21

for the decision, it would be particularly inapornriate to

second guess that decision ^0 vears later.

All we are saying is, you have a statute that on

its face has a 1946 cutoff, and as this Court said in Hibi,

10

the oublic policy underlying that cutoff is clear and must be

11

recoqnized, and that has to be balanced aaainst what at most

12

is an uncertain Congressional intent as to whether the

13

statute was meant to apply to the Philippines at all.

16

QUESTION:

Well, what if we disaaree and think it

was intended to apply to the Philippines?
MR. KLONOFF:

Then we still think for several

17

reasons that that is not dispositive.

In fact, let me take

18

it at several different levels. The Second Circuit in

19

Oleaario, the reasoning of which we aqree with on the statute,

20

assumed for purposes of the decision that the statute was

21

intended to apply to the Philippines, but what the Court said

22

was, that is only the beainning of the Question, because the

23

President in revokinq his authority had discretion to do so

24

under Section 705 of the statute, and more particulari” as a

25

result of the foreign affairs concerns that were the basis for

the revocation.

on' it. would be our submission that even it

2

Congress had been clear that the statute was intended tc

3

apply to the Philippines, that in light of the foreign policy

4

issue that faced the executive and in light of the very

5

reasonable and tailored response of the Attonrey General, that

6

was within his authority under the 1940 Act.

7

Furthermore, even if the conduct is considered

8

to be erroneous, in other words, if the Attorney General had

9

acted under a misoerception, we think that Hibi still fore­

10

closes the claim because it is not enough to simply err.

11

the court indicated, there was no affirmative misconduct thre

12

and accordinolv no basis for ordering equitable relief four

13

decades later, so we think that Hibi would be dispositive

14

reaardless of whether or not thi's Court acirees with us on the

15

interpretation of the statute.

16

As

We bring that out about whether the program was

17

intended to apply in the Philippines only to reinforce our

18

position that this Court has to weicih on the one hand a clear

19

Concessional intent expressed over the years from the 1940

20

statute itself through 1961 and repeated statutes of the

21

public policy that the '40 Act expires, it is revoked, and

22

that all petitions have to be considered under current law,

23

and the Court has to balance that against a rather vaaue, at

24

best, intention on the part of Congress.

QUESTION:

17

the Court in Olegario, the Congress in 1045 that gassed the

18

cutoff amendment, during the course of its deliberations

19

Senator Hayden made the remark that it was his understanding of

20

current law that Philippine veterans or soldiers were not

21

eligible for citizenship unless they later came to the United

22

States, and as the Oleaario Court points out, no one in

Congress expressed any disagreement with that observation.

was to make clear that members of the Commonwealth Army were

QUESTION:

Well, the statute was worded in a
It said that subject to --

I mean, wasn't that the central purpose

of it?
MR. KLONOFF:

That was, and all I am oointina out

18

is that a later remark about one of the purposes of the

19

statute being to make clear that for purposes of the citizen­

20

ship program members of the Commonwealth Army were not to be

21

treated as in the armed forces.

22

If I could turn back just briefly to the Hibi point,

23

the veteran in Hibi made essentially a two-part araument in

24

the Court of Appeals and in this Court.

25

Number One, that the Attorney General deliberately violated

His araument was,

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 62t*4Mt

14

1

the 1940 Act, and that Number Two, present day citizenship

2

was therefore approoriate as an equit^le remedv.

3

Ninth Circuit in Hibi adopted this two-oart analysis, and we

4

submit that if the case caption of the name and the references

5

to parties were removed, the Ninth Circuit's opinion in Hibi

6

is virtually a carbon copy of its current opinion.

7

really no analytical distinction.

8

the Attorney General violated the will of Congress, and

9

secondly that citizenship was approoriate as an equitable

10

remedy.

11

Nov/, the

There is

The Court first said that

Now, this Court summiarily reversed and held that

12

the conduct of the Attorney General at issue was not affirma­

13

tive miscoduct and therefore could not have stooped the

14

enforcement of'the statutory cutoff date, and in the conclu­

sion of'its ooinion the Court stated in no uncertain terms

19

terms had expired more than 20

years before

And now we have somebody coming in with the same

20

identical arguments, the same two-oart analysis, and arcming

21

for citizenship, and we think that Hibi is controlling, and we

22

agree with the dissenting judcres below that there is simolv

23

no meaningful difference between saying that the Government

24

is eauitably estopped from raising a statutorv cutoff and

25

disaregarding the cutoff as a matter of equity.
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4SM

15

1

Furthermore, we would submit Hibi is not only

2

dispositive of the statutory arguments, but is dispositive

3

of the constitutional arguments.

4

outsent that it is important to emphasize that the Court of

5

Appeals did not reach the constitutional issues, so it simply

6

makes no sense to distinguish Hibi on the around that these

7

parties are raising constitutional issues„ That would only be

8

a distinction as a way of defending the Court of Appeals case

9

if the Court of Appeals had in fact decided the case on con­

10

stitutional grounds.

11

Now, let me say at the

But in any event, as we point out, the constitutional

12

argument is in essence the same argument that was made before,

13

simply new labels being attached to old argument, and the

14

policies in Hibi about why a court should not on that

IS

occasion 20 years later now 40 years later ianore the public

16

policy of a cutoff apply equally well whether you label the

17

claim ecruitable estoppel, equitable relief, or due process.

18

And in fact numerous of this Court's decisions

19

dealing with equitable estoppel would confirm that.

20

example, in Immiaration and Naturalization Service versus

21

Miranda, where the Court held that the government was not

22

equitably estopped because of its delay in processing an

23

application for adjustment of status, it would be rather odd

24

if the alien in that case could coe back in and say that that

25

delay violated his constitutional rights and he is therefore

entitled to adjustment of status.

Based on the same aliena­

2

tion, the same thing would be true in Schleicker versus Hansen.

3

The erroneous advice leading an individual not to net

4

benefits for a period of time, the Court held there was no

S

equitable estoppel there, it would be rather odd if the person

6

could come right back in, put the label due process on, and

7

suddenly be eligible for all these -- for all these benefits.

8

If I could, if there are no questions on the Hibi

9

point, turn to the equitable issues, and it is important to

10

emphasize in all of these statutes that I am discussina the

11

reason we are discussing them is because

19

the Attorney General violated the 1940 Act.

had little problem concluding there was such a violation, but

10

as the dissenting judges noted and as the Court in Oleaario

leave that newly emerging country for the United States, and

6

you would have a country that would not have a nucleus of its

8

And it was only upon obtaining this memorandum that

9

the Attorney General initialed the memorandum and made the

10

decision that he would revoke the naturalization authority.

11
12

After Congress made clear that being in the

3

benefits of being i'n the United States armed forces, the

4

Attorney General aaain reinstituted the authority of the

naturalization examiner in the Philipoines, because at that

point since it was then being applied to members of the

7

Scouts rather than the Commonwealth, which was a much smaller

number, the concerns that had initially been raised by the

9

Philippine government were no longer a problem.

20

So we would urge the Court then to follow the

reasoning of the decision in Olegario and to hold that the

Attorney General's conduct was permissible under the '40 Act,

has to balance the equities, and one thing that could not be

MR. UNGAR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

The second is to take a closer look at just what

at the facts in Hibi.

I. think in Hibi the majority opinion

(202) 62S-4M8

24

looked at the facts in a more traditional equitable estoppel

2

context.

In a typical equitable estoppel arqument against

by some erroneous advice that a government

official may have given him.

conclude that because there was no affirmative act which

11

misled Mr. Hibi, that there was no estoppel.

12

rise to no estoppel.

14

there was no misleading of him.

QUESTION:

13

Mr. Hibi couldn't make that kind
Mo

It could give

It not only seemed to conclude, it'did

conclude.
MR. UNGAR:

IS

Well, that is not the way the majority

16

characterized what happened. The majority characterized what

17

happened as a mere failure to publicize the availability of

18

this wartime naturalization law and a mere failure to station

19

an examiner in the Philippines during all of the time that

20

veterans like fir. Hibi were eligible to apply.
But it wasn't just a mere failure, and if the

21
22

majority was saying a mere failure does not qive rise to an

23

estoppel, it certainly did not consider the issue of whether

24

a deliberate decision to disregard the law would qive rise to

25

estoppel.

In that sense, I think you can look back at Hibi

and come to a different conclusion.

MR. UNGAR:

nothing but a matter of neglect because the Hibi decision was

based upon the old Utah Power and Light case.

22

But the analysis that was applied by this Court was not the

23

analysis provided by the court below and it was not

inconsistent with --

25

QUESTION:

Yes, but ordinarily when the Ninth Circuit:

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 62S-4M*

. 26

1

analyzes a case one way and we analyze'it another, we prevail.

2

But apparently that isn't the case here.

3

MR. UNGAR:

Well, I think it is important how

4

perception of what happened determines how one analyzes the

5

case, and the majority in Hibi perceived the case as nothing

6

but mere neglect, whereas the true facts were much more than

7

mere neglect. In any event, I hope you won't consider Hibi

8

to be dispositive, because the veterans in this case have

9

raised a different legal issue.

10

the due process issues that Mr. Hibi did not raise and were

11

not considered in his particular case.

12

QUESTION:

That is, they have raised

Is the Solicitor General correct or

13

incorrect in saying that the Ninth Circuit did not pass on

14

these constitutional issues?

15

MR. UNGAR:

No, he is correct.

The Ningh Circuit

16

did not pass on it, and as we have indicated in our briefs,

17

we believe that this Court may pass on those issues if it so

18

chooses, or remand it for consideration of those issues if it

19

comes to that conclusion.

20

Let me turn first to the Question of error.

The

21

Solicitor General suggests that the Attorney General did have

22

the authority to halt the naturalization program in the

23

Philippines in 1945. I think the place to start first of all

24

is with the fact that what Congress had done here was to

25

enact a statute in the exercise of its exclusive naturalizatior
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

27

authority.

2

to be naturalized.

3

General of the United States.

4

if we look at the language and the purpose of the statute

5

and the means that Congress chose to implement that statute,

6

it seems to me that it is quite clear that the Attorney

7

General did have the obligation to carry out that law by

8

naturalizincr any qualified veteran.

9

Congress and only Congress can determine who is
That is not the function of the Attorney
And in this particular place,

The language of the statute is clear.

It says that

10

any qualified veteran may be naturalized.

11

statute was to provide naturalization for qualified veterans

12

in exchange for the service that they orovided to the United

13

States armed forces during the war.

14

sure that soldiers and sailors overseas would have the

15

opportunity to apply, the statute Section 705 specifically

16

called upon the Attorney General and the Commissioner of

17

Immigration to take whatever action is appropriate to make

18

appropriate rules and recrulations for the purpose of carrying

19

the law into effect, not to frustrate the purpose of the law.

20

That is the mandate that Congress provided in the 1942 amend­

21

ments to the 1940 Act, and I think it is clear from what

22

happened that during the war itself, from 1942 onward

23

throuahout the war the Attorney General recoanized that that

24

was his obligation.

I think certainly the language of the statute said he is

authorized to do this, but in the context of the statute,

certainly made that intention clear, and since they set up this

are considering the due process violation, this issue of

affirmative misconduct is irrelevant.

5

enough.

8

the due process argument is also important because of sub­

legislate away, so to speak, a constitutional injury to these

11

people.

The error is

I think it is important in that respect.

And also

So that would also be important for that reason.
Getting back to the issue of error, whether the

13

Attorney General had the authority to withdraw the examiner

14

from the Philippines during that time, the government says,

15

first of all, that perhaps the Philippines who were servinc

16

there were not entitled to naturalization in the first place.

17

I think what Mr. Klonoff is forgetting is that the Attorney

18

General made that determination in 1945 that Philippines, like

19

these respondents, were eligible for naturalization.

20

not really an issue before the Court any more.

that the executive department has great authority in the field

As to the fact that Congress did not discuss

event of objections by the Philippines government as part of

the foreign affairs issue, so to speak, it seems to me that it

10

is hard to believe that Congress would have wanted to take

11

away the offer of citizenship from Philippines in the

12

Philippines for such reasons, because when Congress enacted

13

this law it made it specifically applicable to persons who

purpose of taking away the offer of citizenship that Congress

had made to them.

It seems to me. if the Attorney General

2

felt that there were reasons not to grant citizenship to

3

Philippines in the Philippines in 1945 it was for Congress

4

to make that decision, because only Congress can determine

5

who is to be naturalized, and that when the Attorney General

6

made his decision, he really crossed the constitutional line

between his role as a person who is supposed to faithfully

had the examiner remained on duty in the Philippines during

agree with you in that respect.

it is difficult, too, because — for another reason.,

19

is that these people, these men who were in the Philippine

I think the 1948 Act, the enactment of that bill, one can

presuppose that Conqress assumed that everybody who was

covered under the 1942 Act would have had a fair chance to

apply, and here the war is --

S

QUESTION:

Well, but if the Solicitor General is

6

correct, I would think maybe that isn't right, because I

7

understood him to say that those whose applications were

8

pending and qualified, some of them were cut off under the

9

1948 Act.

10

MR. UNGAR:

That is .true, and it is interesting

11

also, Your Honor, that Mr. Klonoff refers to the Category Two

12

veterans and Category One veterans.

13

are those who learned about the opportunity to aDoly durinq

14

the war and made an effort to apply but were told that they

were ineligible to do so.

16

Categorv One veterans

Now, the government is acquiescing in their

17

naturalization even today on the theory that they made an

18

effort to do it and there was some sort of -- as an equitable

19

matter they should be naturalized today.

20

Klonoff's argument to its logical conclusion they shouldn't

21

be naturalized either because the 1948 Act would have cut

22

them off, but I think the main point is that 1948 was two

23

years after 'Philippine independence.

that Congress knew that these people were deprived of their

about the injury, again, I think it iks really asking the

about this law had the examiner remained on duty

in the Philippines in 1945.

to turn on that particular question.

crovernment' s own error, and that shouldn't' prejudice these

respondents in that particular light, and I think it is also

3

important to remember in that context that these veterans were

4

cut off during the war from all opportunity to learn about the

5

law.

6

and they were scattered throughout the Philippines. There was

7

only one examiner in Manila who was doing this and there was

8

no official notice to these people as there was to others,

9

and the fact is that some people did find out about it.

10

All this happened as the war was drawing to a close

The Category One people that we have referred to

11

did find out about their opportunity, and they must have

12

found out about it through word of mouth, so it seems to me

13

logical to assume that had the offer remained there there

14

certainly was a better chance that these 'people would have

15

found out about their opportunity to be naturalized and would

16

have taken whatever steps were appropriate to apply.

17

QUESTION:

May I ask, is there any evidence as

18

to whether there is any publicity in newspapers, even in

19

Army papers, you know, the GI -- I can't remember the name of

20

it now, but this program wasn't discussed?

21

MR. UNOAR:

There'is no evidence at all that I could

22

find to show that these people in the Philippines were

23

notified about their opportunity to apply for naturalization.

24
25

Mr. Klonoff refers to the Fedorenko and the Ginsberg
cases as suggesting that a court is not allowed to look beyond
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628*4808

42

1

what the statute provides with respect to naturalization.

2

It seems to me there is a difference between those cases in

3

determining -- there is a difference, in other words, in

4

determining whether an individual is eligible for naturaliza­

5

tion, in which case obviously a court has to look at the

6

naturalization statute as Congress provided.

here was different.

beginning in the Hibi case when they filed their petition for

certiorari in the Hibi case — he was a Scout, by the way, in

the much smaller unit, and at that time the government was

20

suggesting that as many as 30,000 Philippino Scouts were

still alive and would apply and 80,000 dependents would applv,

22

and that is only the' Scouts.

not allow them to do that. He violated his authority under
