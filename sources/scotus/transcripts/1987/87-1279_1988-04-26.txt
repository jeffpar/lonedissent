ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALEXIA MORRISON

7

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MS. MORRISON:

8

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The question before you in this matter concerns

11

whether on its face the independent counsel provisions of the

12

Ethics in Government Act run afoul of the constitution of the

13

United States.

14

This question was raised by the three Appellees in

15

this matter when each was subpoenaed to give evidence before a

16

federal grand jury.

17

covered by Title VI of the Ethics in Government Act, and had

18

been referred in 1986 by the Attorney General for treatment

19

under the independent counsel provisions.

20

That grand jury was considering matters

The Appellees moved to quash the subpoenas on the

21

basis that Title VI was unconstitutional.

22

disagreed and ordered compliance with the subpoenas.

23

Appellees refused, they were held in contempt.

Indeed, as we

2

indicate in our brief, the court looked beyond the facts

3

presented by this case and reached out for facts not before it

4

in order to found a basis for finding constitutional problems

5

with the statute.
This statute was enacted in 1978 after several years

6
7

of congressional hearings and lengthy consideration of its

8

provisions.

9

in 1987.

It has been reauthorized twice: in 1983 and again

In each case some fine tuning has been done to the

10

statute's provisions, but its basic approach has remained

11

consistent over the last decade.
With each passage of the Act, continuing it for five

12
13

year terms, the congressional fine tuning has been done with

14

insights provided from those who have observed operations under

15

the Act, including the United States Department of Justice.

16

Thus Title VI comes before you having three times

17

undergone bicameral passage in the legislature and presentment

18

to the President.

19

has signed the bill into law, albeit on the last occasion with

20

expressed reservations about the Act's constitutionality.

On each occasion, the then sitting President

Having made its legislative choices in enacting the

21

Under the statute, and it would seem

to us as a matter of basic, inherent powers, any citizen, any

12

body, any entity would be free under the statute to bring their

13

concerns about administration misconduct to the attention of

14

the Attorney General, and command thereby, simply by making

15

allegations, that the review required by the statute take

16

place.

17

QUESTION:

18

General on the 80th day after his investigation of whether

19

there are reasonable grounds to further investigate continues,

MS. MORRISON:

The Attorney General has, under the

22

statute as it existed when the matter before the Court was

23

referred for independent counsel treatment, a total of 90 days

24

within which to proceed with the preliminary investigation.

25

that information coming to him would trigger the commencement
of that 90 day period.

Indeed, under the 1987 reauthorization, the Attorney-

2

General gets an additional 15 day period within which to make a

3

determination as to whether or not there is reason to even

4

conduct a preliminary investigation, and then the 90 day period

5

begins to run.

6

9

court and seek an additional 60 days where he needs that

11

And the statute, in all of its incarnations,

additional time to make his determination under the statute.
Indeed, it is probably worth noting on that point

12

that in the very matter before the Court, the Attorney General

13

did not comply with the 90 day requirement that he act on the

14

allegations referred to him by the House Judiciary Committee.

15

Despite that fact the 90th day passed, and nothing happened.

16

Nothing occurred in this matter until the Attorney

17

General, after the 90 day period, made his reference to the

18

court in which he asked that only one of a number of people

19

covered by that House Judiciary Committee report actually be

subject to independent counsel treatment.

a matter of practice, has been the subject of the Department of

Written an opinion on the constitutionality, really,
of this special prosecutor statute
MS. MORRISON:

Well, it is interesting because the

22

constitutional question that the Special Division addressed in

23

the matter was actually raised by the Department of Justice in

24

connection with the review by the court of our request for

25

additional jurisdiction.
We went to the Attorney General initially, and asked

Heritage

12
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

that our jurisdictional mandate be expanded to include

CM

additional individuals.

3

took the provision in Section 594(e) of the statute, which

4

permitted us to address that question, to the court and asked

5

the court to review the matter in the connection of its role as

6

the definer of jurisdiction, the person who is setting the

7

parameters for the appointed individual to pursue.

8
9

When that request was turned down, we

Under 594(e), the court took not only our request but
also a submission from the Department of Justice, and it

10

ultimately turned out submissions in sort of amicus capacity

11

from the two individuals as to whom we sought to gain

12

jurisdiction, and considered all of those matters in connection

13

with its review of the scope of our jurisdiction.

14

In connection with the submission made by the

15

Department of Justice, they raised constitutional questions

16

about the statute, particularly as it would be affected by the

17

interpretation that we were asking the court to place on

18

Section 594(e).

19

And so the question of the constitutionality of the

20

statute was before the court in connection with its

21

consideration of our request which related to jurisdiction.

22

The court's writing of an opinion, we would suggest, simply is

23

a way for it to explain and make a record of how it addressed

24

that jurisdictional question.

So is it perhaps waived, and is that

something that the court below relied on
MS. MORRISON:

The court below did find that by not

15

raising the issue in the District Court, that we had somehow

16

waived that jurisdictional question.

17

on, the Air Florida case, is one that we suggest is not

18

appropriate or not dispositive of the issue, because there

19

there was a question relating to a substantive claim, a new

20

substantive claim that was sought to be raised on appeal.

The case that they relied

21

In a case where the question is jurisdictional, we

22

would suggest that that is something that can be reviewed by

23

any court at any point in the proceedings in order to determine

24

whether it is appropriate to proceed.

25

We would obviously prefer that this Court reach the
constitutional question in this matter.

Heritage

It would be of benefit

14
Reporting Corporation

1

to us and to everybody else who is operating under the Act to

2

have the question resolved, and not to have to proceed any

3

further with the constitutional question hanging over their

4

investigations.
However, our concern that the Appellate Court's

5
6

reading of Ryan and its fairly broad inroads on Blair, as they

7

read it, is a subject that concerns us and caused us to raise

8

the question.
With respect to any investigation conducted under the

10

statute, the independent counsel in three critical respects

11

continues to be a member of the Executive Branch.

13

established policies of the Department of Justice.

judicial or legislative branches.

of cases.

MS. MORRISON:

Yes, the statute says, that except

4

5

That is the same mandate that is sent by the

6

Department in its own guidelines to U.S. attorneys operating

all over the country.

question arises, does the independent counsel process somehow

24

the question of whether or not the prosecution function -- in

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear now from you, Mr. Davidson.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF

MR. DAVIDSON:

11

MICHAEL DAVIDSON

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING APPELLANT

8

10

Thank you, Ms. Morrison.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Congress has delegated a vital function to the

12

court in the implementation of the Ethics Act, but has striven

13

to maintain that function within the boundaries of the

14

Appointments Clause.

15

One manner in which the Appointments Clause carries

16

forward the idea of Separation of Powers is by dividing the

17

function of creating an office under law, and the power of

18

appointing a person to fill that office.

19

the sole power delegated to the court, of substance, is the

20

power of designating an individual to fill an office which has

21

been created by the action of the Attorney General.

22

QUESTION:

In the Ethics Act,

Well, Mr. Davidson, you could say that

23

about any cabinet office or any judicial appointment: Congress

24

creates the positions, the Executive designates the people to

25

fulfill them.
MR. DAVIDSON:

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Davidson, in your view are there no

7

limits at all on inter-branch appointments of inferior

8

officers, from one branch to another?

9

MR. DAVIDSON:

The textual grant of authority to the

10

Congress is indeed a broad grant of authority, and a grant of

11

authority which this Court recognized in the Siebold case.

12

it has been no part of the defense of this statute, that the

3
4

But

power is unbounded.
First, as a practical matter, what the Framers did in

5

the context of the clause which grants this discretion is that

6

it created substantial inducements for self-restraint.

17

Whenever the Senate would agree to a statute that would vest

8

appointment authority in the President alone, or the heads of

19

departments, or the courts of law, it must of necessity forgo

20

its power to advise and consent.

21

And whenever the House and Senate joined together in

22

a statute that would vest power in the courts of law, they both

23

must agree to forgo any political influence over the

24

appointment.

25

But moreover, if one looks at the history of the
utilization of this clause, from the first idea -- not

Heritage

25
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

accepted, but proposed — to vest appointment authority in the

2

court to appoint the Attorney General, from the first enactment

3

of authority of the court to appoint marshals when the marshall

4

appointed by the President has a conflict of interest, to that

5

of appointing interim United States attorneys, to the enactment

6

in Siebold and to this Act, one will see that the pattern that

7

the Congress has historically recognized as a valid pattern is

8

one which recognizes the need for an important degree of

9

affinity between the appointment and function and the role of

10

11

the courts.
And so we do not come before the Court today

12

suggesting that there is an unlimited, unbridled power of the

13

Congress to reach out throughout the Executive Branch, but it

14

is one which is carefully tailored to a function in which the

15

courts may indeed have a recognition of the problem presented.

16

A function that is vested in the court here is a

17

single function of appointing a counsel who mirrors the

18

essential characteristic of the Judicial Branch.

QUESTION:

Well, can you really say it is a single

function, because the Special Division is also given the power

22

investigation as well.

23

MR. DAVIDSON:

And to terminate the

As the Congress made clear in the most

24

recent reauthorization of the Act in 1987, the power to define

25

the jurisdiction of the independent counsel is solely the power
to carry into the appointment order a description of the

Heritage

26
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

#

1

authority that is needed to fully investigate the subject

2

matter which the Attorney General has identified.

3

The Special Division has no power to go beyond that

4

subject matter.

If the independent counsel uncovers the most

5

incriminating evidence about a different subject, the

6

independent counsel's sole opportunity is to go back to the

7

Attorney General and to request an expansion of jurisdiction,

8

and the Attorney General has absolute, unreviewable power to

9

make that determination.

10

QUESTION:

Well, is that what happened in this case?

11

MR. DAVIDSON:

When an expansion was requested, was the

request made to the Attorney General?
MR. DAVIDSON:

The independent counsel did go to the

Attorney General, the Attorney General refused an expansion,

19

and the Special Division, in the opinion which was discussed,

20

concluded that it was bound by that limitation, that it could

21

not go beyond the Attorney General's declination of any further

22

jurisdiction for this independent counsel.

somewhat the jurisdictional definition that had existed

The Special Division interpreted the

prior application of the Attorney General to include authority

to investigate whether the subject of the investigation had

persons.

1

the Attorney General, who is then given the power to

2

investigate.

3

In 1982, the Congress, out of concern and at the

4

suggestion of the Department of Justice, placed into the law

5

the obligation of the Attorney General to weigh the allegations

6

against the established policies of the Department of Justice.

7

It is not his duty to simply ask for an independent counsel

8

because a committee of the Congress has asked for it, but is to

9

engage in sufficient investigation to determine whether there

10
11

are reasonable grounds.
This case is the example of that: the Attorney

12

General's determination was a discriminating determination

13

which exonerated two of the possible subjects of this

14

investigation.

15

If I may speak for a moment about the removal

16

provision, which we think is quite central to this litigation.

17

The removal provision is one which the Congress has worked out

18

extensively with Executive Branch.

19

The first proposals were to vest removal authority in

20

the court, but persuaded particularly by the American Bar

21

Association, the Congress concluded that that might invest a

22

degree of supervisory power in the court which belonged

23

properly in an officer of the Executive Branch.

matter, where their counsel had engaged in extraordinary

3

impropriety.

4

the Congress in 1982 and asked for a lowering of that standard

5

to good cause, the Congress responded and lowered the standard

6

to good cause.

But when the Department of Justice returned to

And then in 1987, to avoid any question whether the

7
8

appointing court would have a vested interest in maintaining

9

its appointee in office, the Congress removed authority to

10

review removal of an independent counsel from the appointing

11

court to the District Court, and it further eliminated a

12

special standard of review that had been enacted earlier in the

13

law which would have allowed for review of any error of law or

14

fact.

15

Now the standard is the standard that the District

16

Court will conclude best accords with statutory and

17

constitutional values involved.

18

has the first opportunity to construe the statute.

19

the suggestions that have been made that the Attorney General

20

would lack the information upon which to base his

21

determinations, the statute clearly contemplates that the

22

Attorney General will make a reasonable and good faith inquiry

23

to the facts, because he must report on the facts that he has

24

found which would justify a removal.

That is correct.

inquiry that he deems necessary to determine whether there is

QUESTION:

MR. DAVIDSON:

How does he go about it?

exists.

exact parameters of the good cause provision.

But I understand

I think that there are two other aspects

Presidential power, the power to decide how to

brought, how it fits with national policy, whether matters

21

should be brought in front of this Court or not cannot be

reduced to a set of rules.

23

That is why we have a President.

If we could put it in guidelines we could do away

extraordinarily limited -- as they have to be -- part of the

(202) 628-4888

2

was intended to make sure that the Executive cannot control,

3

and therefore it separates the Executive from one of its

4

primary functions, first appointment and then control.
Let me say a few words, if I can, about the claim of

5
6

the independent counsel that of course the Attorney General

7

maintains the ability to make decisions at the threshold with

8

respect to whether an independent counsel shall be appointed.
The Congress, first of all, describes the Attorney

9
10

General's function as a screening function.

As Justice Scalia

11

has said, it has to be done in a very short time period.

12

more importantly, it has to be done in a situation in which the

13

Attorney General is denied investigatory tools:

14

grand jury, he can't use compulsory process.

But

he can't use a

So, for example, in this case Congress put in front

15

of the Attorney General four volumes, two and half years of

17

investigation, and said decide in 90 days without any

18

investigatory tools whether or not further investigation may be

19

warranted.

20

provides the Attorney General with no real choice --

21

That question stacks the decks too much.

MR. MARTIN:

He had the whole FBI available, but the

criteria which is imposed on the Attorney General is to make a
decision in a short time period as a screen —
QUESTION:

Yes, but I think your constitutional

argument would be the same if it was six months or a year,
wouldn't it?
MR. MARTIN:

I think the difficulty constitutionally

is that the Attorney General is not given the choice that he
normally has, if it were a situation where you or I were
involved, to decide, well, I need further investigation, or I
need to use a grand jury, or I need to dispose of it in one of
many different ways for national policy reasons or national
security reasons.
Instead he is given one choice and one choice only,
which is to take it out of the Executive Branch and to give it
to someone who is subject only to the control of his or her own
personal views.
There was some discussion earlier about the power to
expand, and again the legislative history, I think, makes clear
what's the court's role here.

First of all, it matches a

person to the particular prosecution, and then it decides what
shall be prosecuted.
In the Iran-Contra -QUESTION:

Mr. Martin, I doubt whether we are going

interpreted in an unconstitutional fashion.

I mean, the

chances that we would do that are rather slim, don't you think?
MR. MARTIN:

It certainly is true, but it is also

true that the language cannot be interpreted in a way wholly
inconsistent with the legislative history or to defeat the
legislative purpose, as the Schor case said.
But let me look at the language —
QUESTION:

Try us, if the difference is between

constitutionality and unconstitutionality.

Do you know of any

case where this Court said, gee, on its face this statute could
be constitutional, but the legislative history requires us to
interpret it in such a fashion that it is unconstitutional?
Can you give me one case where we have done that?
MR. MARTIN:

No.

But I can give you the specific

language that I rely upon for this question of defining.

The

statute says the Attorney General assists in defining
jurisdiction.

The statute in its own language says the court

defines with respect to jurisdiction.
In the Iran-Contra matter, for example, materials
have been lodged with this Court.

It was the Court that

decided to add the matter of Nicaragua as a response to a
Senate recommendation; it was not the Attorney General who
decided that.
The Special Division in a number of cases adds
additional people or related matters to its jurisdiction.

which Congress has thought was a substantial one, an important

power.
QUESTION:

4

What specifically does the statute say

5

about the role of the court in defining the jurisdiction of the

6

prosecutor?
MR. MARTIN:

7

It's very short: it says the court shall

8

find the jurisdiction of the prosecutor, and it doesn't say,

9

and it indicates that the Attorney General shall provide a

10

report to assist in that process.

11

on the court; there is no question about that.
QUESTION:

It doesn't in any way direct the court to

MR. MARTIN:

15

It places the power squarely

It does not, Justice Rehnquist.

It does

not.
QUESTION:

Do you contend that the definition of

17

jurisdiction in this case was unconstitutional in any way?

18

There may be some other cases the court might define the

19

jurisdiction in a way that would be totally intolerable, to go

20

investigate the Soviet Union or something.

21

got to do with the case before us?

22

MR. MARTIN:

But what does that

23

of the matters which the court resolved the independent counsel

included matters that were rejected by the Attorney General.

13

QUESTION:

If the Attorney General said, I think

14

there is probable cause, or reasonable cause or whatever the

15

statutory language is, to investigate charge A, and he names

16

one statute, could the court authorize the independent counsel

17

to investigate the possibility of violating related statutes?

18

Or must he just confine it to the particular statute

19
20

MR. MARTIN:

The statute, again -- the language

21

doesn't say anything but define, the legislative history

22

suggests the power to add related matters.

23

QUESTION:

But is it your submission that if the

24

Attorney General gives a specific reference naming only one

25

criminal statute and one target, possible defendant, that any
enlargement of that scope of jurisdiction to include a second

Heritage

2

statute would violate the constitution?
MR. MARTIN:

No, our submission is not based upon the

3

expansion activity of the Attorney General, it is based upon

4

the fact that the matter is taken out from the Executive Branch

5

altogether so that he can no longer control what the prosecutor

6

does, and with respect to all the prosecutorial decisions which

7

affect individual rights and subject a person to all the power

8

of the state, all through that process the Attorney General and

9

the President are without control.

And that is what this statute does by its language

and by its legislative history was intended to do, and that

12

displacement of the President is, we think, the problem.

I think it should be read in tandem with the function

terms of that as well.

which was indicated specifically that public integrity section

Mr. Davidson, following up on Justice

MR. MARTIN:

8

I think the answer has to be resolved by

looking in two directions: Article III and Article II.

In an

22

side of it, I think the difference is absolutely enormous.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

If you look at the Article II

Are you questioning the constitutionality

of that as a theoretical matter?
MR. MARTIN:

It need not be reached here, but the

Court in the Solomon case, which is the one case which said it

was constitutional, relied heavily that in that situation the

2

United States Attorney goes right into the Executive Branch,

3

and he is subject immediately to the control of the Executive

4

Branch, and Attorney General, if he wants to, can move him

5

immediately.
So it doesn't involve the displacement of power from

6
7

one Branch to the other.

That's why I say when you look at

8

these issues of what you can do on the Appointments Clause, it

is important to look at what its ramifications are for the

10

various parts of our Constitution, for Article II and Article

statutory framework that is urged to be founded on this

QUESTION:

5
6

My only point is that our history in

practice is rife with examples of inter-branch appointments.
MR. MARTIN:

I don't think there is anything in our

history -- to add to your point -- where someone was appointed

by a court to handle, independently of the Executive Branch,

one of the core functions of that Branch.

10

QUESTION:

Yes, but you used the term core function.

11

One of the questions is whether this is a core function,

The answer is that it is not explicitly

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES FRIED, ESQ.

12

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING APPELLEES

13
14
15

MR. FRIED:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We raise a number of particular objections to the

16

independent counsel statute: to the total exclusion of the

17

President from her appointment, from the very significant

18

limitation on the President's power to direct and remove the

19

independent counsel, and on the inappropriate involvement of

20

the judiciary in the appointment, direction, and removal of the

21

independent counsel.

22

But our central objection is that this statute strips

23

the President of purely Executive function, criminal

24

prosecution in an important class of cases, and lodges that

25

function in one almost wholly untethered to the President, and
at the same time it deprives the Congress of its power of
57

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

advice and consent, but worse, it absolves the Congress of its

2

weightiest and most painful duty, which is the scrutiny of the

3

Executive Branch, backed up by the painful duty of impeachment.
Now the Appointments Clause problem, to our mind, is

4
5

simply the most extreme of the constitutional anomalies in this

6

statute.

7

Buckley v. Valeo, who said the appointment power was a major

8

building block fitted into the constitutional structure.

It was Justice White, in a separate opinion in

By removing that block, this is only one of the

9
10

several ways in which this statute deforms that structure.

11

Now, one of the reasons that are offered for these

12

constitutional anomalies, the importance to the public to feel

3

that Executive officers would be investigated and prosecuted

4

with vigor and impartiality.
And the instance which the Appellant and all of her

5
6

amici urge is the Watergate episode.

7

is thought to teach the necessity for this provision.

8

respect we submit that that episode teaches the exact opposite

9

lesson.

20
21

That is the episode which
With

True, the dismissal of Special Prosecutor Cox was

regrettable, but it was not a constitutional catastrophe.
Had Special Prosecutor Jaworski been dismissed, had

22

the Watergate task force been disbanded, had those prosecutions

23

been abandoned, that would have been another matter.

24

everyone knows that those prosecutions proceeded to their

25

denouement without missing a beat.
And they did so not because of jury rigged

But

constitutional innovations such as we have here, but because of

2

public pressure and the long, deep shadow of Congress's power

3

of impeachment.

4

precisely how our Framers envisaged that the matter should

5

work.

6

That is our constitutional system, and that is

To be sure, it did not work without struggle and

7

strain, but it is a central fallacy of this statute to think

8

that a supremely political object — and I use the word

9

politics in its high sense, of those occasions which

10

concentrate the moral and practical sense of the people -- can

11

be accomplished without politics, that in some sense it can be

12

turned over to serene persons operating outside of the

13

political process, platonic guardians of sort.

14

Now, in Humphrey's Executor the Court described an

15

appropriate occasion for such perspicience.

16

appropriate to have a commission whose duties are neither

17

political nor executive, like the Interstate Commerce

18

Commission, and that commission can then exercise the trained

19

judgment of a body of experts.

20

It said that it's

That is not what the special prosecutor, what the

21

independent counsel does, and it is profoundly wrong to absolve

22

the political branches of their responsibilities, and hand over

23

those responsibilities to persons who act totally untethered to

24

any politically responsible person.

hard to imagine any officer in the government who is less

It is not entirely clear

7

whether they are officers of the United States or officers of

9

quite clear that the Appointments Clause, as it relates to

10

inferior officers, must lodge that appointment either in the

prominently in the Appellant's brief.

1

It is only when you have cross branch appointments that it

2

becomes crucially important to decide whether a particular

3

person is important enough, subordinate enough to be subject to

4

the inferior officer clause or the principal officer clause.

5

We submit that these are problems which the framers

6

did not intend us to face and that we need not face, because

7

the appropriate thing to do is simply to recognize and to

8

maintain the integrity of each of the branches, and not

9

countenance a system which would allow the Executive Branch to

10

be shattered into a thousand small offices, each of whom would

11

be appointed by courts of law.

12

Now, there's one further point that needs to be

13

mentioned regarding the control of the independent counsel by

14

the Attorney General.

15

the prosecutorial function which the Appellant and her Amici

16

offer is one which is scarcely recognizable to anybody who has

17

ever wielded that power.

18

It does seem to us that the picture of

I think that power is best described by Mr. Justice

a kind of discretion which can only be safely lodged in

responsibility is subject to Congressional oversight and if

MS. MORRISON:

Mr. Martin indicated in his argument

15

that the case that he thought might be important to the Court

16

discussed the President's pardon power that's constitutionally

textually committed to the President personally.

18

In this matter, we are talking about enforcement

powers that are created by statute, and Congress has found

within its appropriate power, we think, that individual matters

of criminal law enforcement should not be matters of politics.

I believe the statute says, except

5

QUESTION:

All right.

6

MS. MORRISON:

And I made reference before to the

fact that there are certain policies within the Department's

command.

Some of those would be checks that would not be

possible under the independent counsel statute where the

independent counsel is acting in lieu of the Attorney General

12

for purposes of let's say an immunity grant.
