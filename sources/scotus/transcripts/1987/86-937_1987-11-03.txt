Secondly,

21

the Court of Appeals erroneously supposed

22

that it was freer to find plain error in this case because the

prosecutor's remarks never objected to at trial implicated

Robinson's constitutional rights.

At

there's no good reason to think that

the jury is going to take those comments in an impermissible
way.
I have

in mind the legions of cases dealing — in

which the prosecutor says,

the evidence is uncontradicted,

is

unrefuted, and in which the Courts of Appeals nevertheless feel
constrained to struggle with that as a Griffin problem.

It

isn't, and it isn't for a variety of reasons, and the rule that
we have urged today,

we think,

will settle a great many of

those and reduce disputes that have nothing to do with the
meaning of Griffin.

I think there is a good deal of ambiguity to them,

which is exactly why the law insists that the participants in

there's every good reason to indulge

the presumption that the trial judge understood these remarks

not done so in this case.
We do think,

that the fact that he did so
