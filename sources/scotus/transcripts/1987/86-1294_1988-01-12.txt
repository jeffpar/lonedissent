ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES FRIED, ESQUIRE

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

9

MR. FRIED:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In this case, the Director of the Central

10

Intelligence Agency dismissed from his employment Doe, who had

11

been employed in the Agency for some nine years.

12

he was dismissed, he held a covert position as an electronics

13

technician.

14

At the time

In January of the year in which he was dismissed, he

15

voluntarily informed security officials that he was a

16

homosexual; and after considerable inquiry, negotiation and

17

discussion, in May of that year he was informed that the

18

Director of Central Intelligence had decided to terminate his

19

employment pursuant to Section 102(C) of the Act, which speaks

20

of termination with the Director deems that such action is

21

necessary or advisable in the interests of the United States.

22

23
24
25

Doe brought suit, seeking reinstatement or
reconsideration of the decision.
The Court of Appeals held that there were no
procedural defects in the procedures below, but did state that

Heritage

1

there was unclarity about the basis for the Director's action.

2

It was possible, in the Court of Appeals' view, that

3

Doe had been dismissed pursuant to a general policy of

4

dismissing all homosexual employees.

5

unclarity there.

6

Again, they found further

To the extent that such a policy dealt with employees

7

who had engaged in homosexual activities, which Doe had stated

8

he had since the year 1976, the Court of Appeals felt that the

9

matter was foreclosed by Circuit precedent in the case of

10
11

Dronenburq v. Zech.
However, the Court of Appeals thought it

12

possible that Doe had been dismissed on the basis of a general

13

policy for dismissing all employees with a homosexual

14

orientation.

15

And in that event, it became incumbent upon the

16

Agency to explain, in the Court's words, "at the very least,"

17

why such a policy was necessary and advisable in the interest

18

of the United States.

19

The Court of Appeals concluded, of course, that, to

20

the extent that these questions must be pursued in the District

21

Court, that review was not precluded under the Administrative

22

Procedure Act by Section 102(C).

23

It has been our position in all courts and it is our

24

position today that Section 102(C) of the National Security Act

25

of 1947, which sets up the Central Intelligence Agency,

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

5

1
2

precludes judicial review, under the APA, of this question.
It is important at the outset I think to have a sense

3

of the structure of the 1947 Act as a whole.

4

short statute.

5

It is quite a

It is a statute which establishes the Agency.

The first provision says there shall be a Central

6

Intelligence Agency and a director and a deputy director, and

7

then goes on to say what will happen if the director is a

8

member of the military.

9

The next section, which is Subsection (C), the one in

10

question here, which is the very first substantive section of

11

the Act, states that, notwithstanding the provisions of Section

12

751, or the provisions of any other law, the Director of

13

Central Intelligence may, in his discretion, terminate the

14

employment of any officer or employee of the Agency whenever he

15

shall deem such termination necessary or advisable in the

16

interests of the United States.

17
18
19

That is the first substantive section of the Act
setting up the Agency.
The next section, the very next section, sets out the

20

powers and duties of the director and the Agency, and that

21

section contains the provision which was the subject of this

22

Court's recent decision in CIA v. Sims.

23

It is that section which states that the Director of

24

Central Intelligence shall be responsible for protecting

25

intelligent sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure.

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

6

In our view, these two sections are really flip

1
2

sides of each other, that the general injunction upon the

3

Director to protect the intelligence sources and methods of the

4

United States implies, and then that it has set out the

5

specific duty to protect the integrity and security of the CIA

6

work force.

7

It seems to us, further, that the decision of this

8

Court in CIA v. Sims, which dealt with the latter provision,

9

sets the tone and sets the context for the consideration of the

10

case here.
In the Sims case, the Court of Appeals, the same

11
12

Court of Appeals as decided this case, while recognizing the

13

very special and delicate position of the Agency, went on to

14

give that provision what this Court described as a "crabbed

15

interpretation," an interpretation which would allow a

16

considerable amount of what I would call rummaging around in

17

the business of the Agency in litigation, through deposition,

18

through discovery, through testimony, document production, and

19

the like.

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Fried, I am not sure that I know

21

exactly how to interpret the majority opinion of the Court of

22

Appeals in this case.

23

Do you think that Court opened it up for courts to

24

determine in each instance under 102 whether the decision was

25

in the interest of the United States?

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
628-4888

(202)

7
1

MR. FRIED:

I think it certainly did.

2

What the Court said was that there was a possibility

3

that the firing was on the basis of a general policy relating

4

to employees with a homosexual orientation.

5
6

7

Therefore, it was open for District Court to inquire
what the policy is.
And, Justice O'Connor, it is not sufficient, I

8

suppose, once you get into litigation, for the Agency

9

to say well, we have no such policy.

10

11

simply

Because the litigant can

say, yes, you do, and let's have a lawsuit about that.
QUESTION:

Is it open to the Director to protect

12

himself from judicial inquiry by saying in effect that he

13

intends to give no reason?

14

MR. FRIED:

The Court of Appeals, in one of the more

15

mysterious aspects of its decision, said that if the Director

16

intended to terminate the employment without giving a reason,

17

that that would be all right.

18

But if, however, he was terminating the employment on

19

the basis of this policy, that would trigger the responsibility

20

of the Director to explain at the very least why his decision

21

and that policy was necessary and advisable.

22

Therefore, it would seem to me that it is open to a

23

persistent litigant in every case to say you, Director, did not

24

intend to give reasons, but it seems to us that nonetheless,

25

you acted under a general policy and now we think that policy

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

8

1

is unconstitutional and you must at the very least explain why

2

it is advisable.

3

QUESTION:

If it is correct that the Director

4

intended to give no reason, do you support that aspect of the

5

Court's opinion?

6

7
8

9

MR. FRIED:

I would be very happy to rest content

with that, except I don't know what it gives me.
I am afraid that I am buying an empty bag there,
because the Court of Appeals, while it acknowledge that

10

possibility, I don't think would have been content with a

11

simple statement that that is what we intend.

12

Indeed, it is a little hard to know how the Director

13

could have more clearly indicated that he was not putting

14

forward reasons, and inviting inquiry into the basis of his

15

action, because what he stated was that he is terminating the

16

employment because he deems it necessary and advisable.

17

Now, that seems to me to be about as good a way as

18

any to say I don't want to give any further reasons.

19

the Court of appeals said well, let's rummage around a little

20

bit more to see what we come up with. And that is what I think

21

is intolerable.

22

23
24
25

QUESTION:

And yet,

Do you think that the Congress intended to

preclude litigation of even Constitutional claims with 102?
MR. FRIED:

Yes, I do.

that has been our position

right along and that is certainly our position here today.

Heritage

9

QUESTION:

1
2

3

Even if were for example a policy not to

hire a black or a woman or something of that kind?
QUESTION:

Justice O'Connor, if the policy related to

4

hiring or promotion, Congress has subjected the CIA, in 72, to

5

Title VII, so that we would not that.

6

I think what we are talking about is termination of

7

employment.

And termination of employment is a very special

8

matter, because if you are an employee of the Central

9

Intelligence Agency, you have access to the most sensitive

10

intelligence information which this country possesses.

And the

11

only way to remove that access is to terminate the employment.

12

I think that is why such a special emphasis is given

13

to the issue of termination of employment and why it, in the

14

Congressional scheme, this is a Congressional scheme, it stands

15

on a different footing from the initial employment decision or

16

even promotion decisions.

17

The Central Intelligence Agency is subject to Title

18

VII and in fact welcomes the procedures that are involved

19

because it considers that those procedures in their invocation

20

which involve a considerable amount of internal review,

21

maintains the kind of morale inside the Agency which they are

22

very anxious to have.

23

But there does come a point where the Agency simp]y

24

must be able, without giving reasons and without triggering the

25

kind of inquiry, narrow as the Court said it was, but wide as

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

10
1

we think it is, without triggering the kind of inquiry in open

2

court.

3

QUESTION:

Why would a Title VII promotion suit

4

involve any less rummaging around?

5

MR. FRIED:

There are a number of very important

There is confession and there is avoidance, Justice

Certainly what is involved in Title VII is a

10

requirement to go to the Agency and to pursue internal remedies

11

there.

12

a handful — well, seven; I suppose that's a hand and part of a

13

second hand -- of those cases filed, since 1972, indicates that

14

the internal procedures take care of the matter.

15

And the fact that there have been a handful, literally

Now, you can have the lawsuit.

The important

16

is that that lawsuit itself might be trumped by 102(C).

17

is important to keep that possibility open.

QUESTION:

And it

I thought you were rejecting that

19

possibility.

20

the Title VII lawsuits for promotion but it does prevent this.

21

I thought you were saying 102(C) does not prevent

MR. FRIED:

Well, there would be the promotion and

22

perhaps there might be damages paid, but if it was determined

23

that this person no longer is somebody with whom the Agency is

24

comfortable as somebody with access, then they could terminate

25

that employee.

QUESTION:

1

No, they have not terminated him. They

2

just have not promoted him.

5

He says he is entitled to a

And you say that a lawsuit will lie.
MR. FRIED:

It will lie.

There is no question that

it will lie.

6

QUESTION:

And I say I do not see why that doesn't

7

open up the CIA to the same kind of probing that you are

8

objecting to here.

9
10

MR. FRIED:

Well, it does, but that is Congress'

decision.
We are saying that Congress made quite a different

11
12

decision as to the termination of employment.

13

is a rational line to draw.

14

QUESTION:

And I think that

It seems to me irrational.

I would think

15

that you would want to give the individual more protection for

16

dismissal than you would for promotion.
MR. FRIED:

17

The person who is interested in pursuing

18

a promotion claim is a person who is interested in working

19

within the Agency and who the Agency it interested in keeping

20

on in some capacity or another.
That person, on both sides of the transaction, is

21
22

still as it were, part of the family.
When you have a termination matter, you have a person

23
24

who at least one side of the relationship wishes to sever

25

entirely.

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

12

That is just a balance which was struck by the

1
2

Congress.
It is also worth noting that Title VII lawsuits

3
4

involve particularly serious and traditionally particularly

5

important Constitutional rights.

6

If Congress decided, which it has, that

7

discrimination on the basis of age, sex, race, are forms of

8

discrimination which are simply intolerable, then that is a

9

conclusion which we must bow to.

10

This is not a Constitutional

argument we are making.
QUESTION:

11

All of that goes, it seems to me, though,

12

not to — you have been objecting to rummaging around.

It

13

seems to me the rummaging around is going to be the same in

14

both cases.
Now, I can see a distinction between the two, based

15
16

not on the rummaging, but on the fact that the Courts

17

absolutely have no power to require the Director to hire

18

somebody he does not want in his office.

19

That is a different point from rummaging.

20

I could see drawing the distinction between Title VII

21

non-firing cases and other Title VII case on that basis.
That is, the Court has the power to prevent him from

22
23

promoting someone, or from not promoting someone, but he has

24

absolutely no power to prevent him from telling somebody to be

25

gone.

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

13

1

But that is not what you seem to be arguing.

2

MR. FRIED:

If the Courts have the power, as the

3

Circuit Court here asserted, to tell the Director, you may not

4

tell someone to be gone, then what follows is the mischievous

5

rummaging which concerns us.

6

Now, there is no doubt, the Agency is going to be

7

subject to lawsuits in a variety of areas.

8

say everything the Agency does, whatever it might be, and to

9

whomever it may do it, is absolutely precluded from review.

Congress did not

And my argument should not be taken as asserting

10
11

that.

What I am asserting is that Congress drew a line.

12

Perhaps the line should have been drawn somewhere else, as a

13

matter of policy.

14

But Congress drew the line where it drew it. And we

15

are saying that where it has drawn that line, it should be

16

respected.

17

the that to the important policies there, in effect authorized

18

the most extensive kind of inguiries.

19

And the Court of Appeals, while it gave a tip of

And that, we think, is what Congress intended to

20

preclude in 102(C), though, to be sure, they did not intend to

21

preclude it in respect to Title VII actions.

22

is Congress' decision.

23
24
25

So be it.

That

But here we have the Executive and the Congress lined
up together, rather firmly, for the proposition -QUESTION:

Mr. Fried, I am a little puzzled.

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

They

14
1

did not intend to preclude it in Title VII actions, but then

2

you say only Title VII actions involving promotions, but not

3

Title VII actions involving discharge?

4

MR. FRIED:

QUESTION:

certiorari petition?

7

the APA, I thought.

8

MR. FRIED:

9

QUESTION:

That is correct.

That is correct.

But is that question presented in your
You just asked about review pursuant to

Yes, that is correct.
So we don't have a question presented as

10

to whether there can be a Title VII action or a Federal

11

Question action.

12

13
14

MR. FRIED:

No.

We do not, in this case.

I was

endeavoring to answer Justice Scalia's question.
QUESTION:

What you are saying though is your broad

15

position is that even if the Agency had a policy of just hiring

16

born again Christians and for religious reasons they thought

17

they were the only appropriate agents to hire, that could not

18

be reviewed?

19
20

21
22

MR. FRIED:

No, that is not my position. 102(C)

refers to termination.
QUESTION:

Well, they terminated everybody who wasn't

a born again Christian.

23

MR. FRIED:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. FRIED:

They would have to hire them first.
Sure, they hired them.
That would strike me as very peculiar.

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

15
1

QUESTION:

2

MR. FRIED:

3
4
5

If they did it, I think they would be in

very hot water of all sorts.
QUESTION:

But would it be judicially reviewable?

That is what I am asking.

6

MR. FRIED:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. FRIED:

9

Suppose they did it?

It is my position that it would not.
It would not.
But there is no doubt that this Court

would be pressed, and I think might very well be tempted, to

10

reach a different conclusion in that case, because we have here

11

not one, but two questions.

12

13
14

We have, first of all, the statutory question:

does

102(C) preclude judicial review?
And I am quite clear that 102(C) would preclude

15

judicial review even if the claim were made that they first

16

hire and then terminate all employees who are not born again

17

Christians.

18

This Court might nonetheless conclude that 102(C), as

19

applied to that circumstance, is unconstitutional, as applied.

20

They might so conclude.

21

But I do not think that that extreme, but perhaps

22

useful, ability to keep the door unlocked though closed applies

23

in this case with these claims.

24
25

QUESTION:

Assuming, and I am not suggesting that it

is, but assuming a policy of denying employment to homosexuals

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

16
1

was unconstitutional, why would the review issue be different

2

than denying employment to anyone who is not a born again

3

Christian?
MR. FRIED:

4
5

denying.

It is a question of terminating.
QUESTION:

8

people.

9

Once again, it is not a question of

Terminating.

Sure.

You have a change of

The prior administration hired all these

The new administration comes in and says we just

10

don't think we want anybody except born again Christians and no

11

homosexuals.

12

If it is unconstitutional to do that, you seem to

13

concede it would be reviewable on the religious issue but not

14

on the other issue.

15

MR. FRIED:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. FRIED:

18
19

I do not say —
We might be pressed to find it was.
I am quite clear that 102(C) expresses a

Congressional intention to preclude review.
I cannot predict what this Court would say if that

20

claim -- religious discrimination -- were brought to it and the

21

question was whether 102(C) was Constitutional as applied to

22

that claim.

23

QUESTION:

I am puzzled by the footnote that your

24

opponents have on Page 16 of their brief about the quotes from

25

the District Court where the Government lawyers seem to say

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

17

1

that they were not asserting that the Director protected them,

2

insulated them from the Constitution.

3

are.

4

MR. FRIED:

But you seem to say they

Absolutely we are saying that.

And in

5

our reply brief we thought it important to deal with that point

6

by reprinting portions of the colloquy.

7

Our position is that we have been asserting, from the

8

outset, that review is precluded, and, of course, that such

9

review is Constitutional.

10

Now, at different times, pressed with different

11

questions, Government lawyers have struggled with different

12

aspects of that very difficult point.

13

But our position right along has been 102(C)

14

precludes APA review of this question and, as applied in this

15

case, it is perfectly Constitutional.

16
17
18

We have never receded from that point and we
certainly press it here.
QUESTION:

I thought Justice Stevens asked whether

19

you asserted that you were insulated from the Constitution.

20

Was that how you put the question?

21

understood you brief, you are not saying you are insulated from

22

the Constitution.

23

MR. FRIED:

And to that question, as I

One is not insulated from the

24

Constitution, in the sense that this Court is going to have to

25

decide whether the review preclusion as applied to a particular

v

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

18

1

claim is Constitutional.

2

We say that it is.

And if we are correct, then to

3

that extent, the matter is insulated from the Constitution if

4

that is how one wishes to put it.

5

But you are never insulated —

6

QUESTION:

7

One can be insulated from our review

without being insulated from the Constitution, I take it.

8

The President, in deciding whether this policy should

9

be adopted, about homosexual firing in the CIA certainly has to

10

sit down and think, does the Constitution permit this, doesn't

11

he?

12

13
14

He could not do it if the Constitution in his view
prohibited it, could he?
I thought your brief said you are bound by the

15

Constitution, but your judgment in this narrow area of the CIA

16

is final, as opposed to our judgment being final, where it

17

normally is.

18

MR. FRIED:

There is no doubt that the Director of

19

the Central Intelligence Agency takes an oath to support the

20

Constitution and that 102(C) is a review preclusion statute,

21

not something which says that the Director of the Central

22

Intelligence Agency is somehow not subject to the Constitution

23

he takes an oath to uphold.

24
25

QUESTION:

General Fried, you say that 102(C)

prevents review by the Courts of a claim that the termination

MR. FRIED:

Well, I hope I don't.

14

QUESTION:

I think it was used first from the Bench.

15

MR. FRIED:

I would like to say a little bit about

16

the statutory interpretation point, whether indeed 102(C)

17

intends the very categorical insulation from judicial review,

18

though not from the Constitution, which we assert.

19

Our point is really quite a simple one, that at

20

different times, different language is used to accomplish

21

this.

22

In 1978, the Congress said that the President may

23

detain or remove hostile aliens.

24

the APA the Ludecke case, this Court said that was sufficient

25

to preclude APA review.

And in the first case under

In 1947, the language was "...in his discretion."

1964, in the Act setting up the National Security Agency, the

3

language is "...in his discretion, and it is final."

4

In 1984, in the statute setting up the Defense

5

Intelligence Agency, the language was "...final and shall not

6

be appealed outside the Department of Defense."

7

To our minds, the language changes.

The thought is

8

the same.

clear that in 1798, in 1947, in 1964, in 1984, Congress was

seeking to accomplish the same result.
If that is not so, then we have the anomaly, an

11
12

anomaly which Congress clearly stated in various reports, it

13

did not imagine it was facing, that the Secretary of Defense,

14

in respect to the Defense Intelligence Agency, or the National

15

Security Agency, has this unreviewable power, but the Director

16

of the Central Intelligence Agency does not.
It seems to us that that is not a sensible scheme,

17
18

and it is not the scheme which Congress imagined it was

19

enacting.

22

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK H. LYNCH, ESQUIRE

23

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. LYNCH:

24
25

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

22

The only claim that Mr. Doe has that survives the

1
2

Court of Appeals Opinion is the decisions of the Court of

3

Appeals that he has an arguable Constitutional claim, if in

4

fact the Agency has a policy of discharging people on the basis

5

of homosexual orientation.

6

So the question then is whether Section 102(C) of the

7

National Security Act of 1947 precludes judicial review of that

8

Constitutional claim.

9

Now, whether or not the Government conceded that

10

there could be review of Constitutional claims, I think they

11

did in the District Court.

12

Appeals.

13

It is less clear in the Court of

But whether they conceded it or not, it is absolutely

14

clear that that issue was not litigated, because as the case

15

progressed to the District Court, and in the Court of Appeals,

16

the question was whether the Agency had followed its

17

regulations, not whether it had violated a substantive

18

Constitutional prohibition.

19

So consequently, the question of whether the statute

20

precludes judicial review of a Constitutional claim was not

21

litigated below.
At the least, we think the Court ought to remand the

22

23

case.

If it thinks that the statute does preclude review, at

24

the least it ought to remand the case for ventilation of the

25

question of whether Congress can constitutionally preclude

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

23

1

review.

2

3

However, we also submit that the statute does not
preclude review of Constitutional claims.

4

The statute on its face says nothing about judicial

5

review.

6

review.

The legislative history says nothing about judicial

7

What the statute does say is that notwithstanding the

8

provisions of the Lloyd-LaFollette Act or any other statute,

9

the Director, in his discretion, may terminate Agency employees

10

when he deems it necessary and advisable for the United States

11

to do so.
Now given the fact that there was not judicial

12

13

review of termination decisions in 1947, the most plausible

14

explanation of that language was that Congress was intending to

15

keep CIA employees who had been terminated out of the Civil

16

Service Commission, where they were entitled to go under the

17

Veterans Preference Act which had been passed in 1944.
That seems to be a very plausible, rational

18
19

Congressional expectation.

The CIA, after all, in the

20

beginning, in 1947, was going to be heavily populated with

21

Veterans in the Office of Strategic Services. They were

22

Veterans.

23

Without this statute they would be able to

go to the

24

Civil Service Commission to contest the Director's termination

25

decisions.

And it is quite plausible that Congress would have

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628--4888

24
1
2

wanted to prevent that.
But, since there was not judicial review of any

3

termination decisions at that point, it seems to me impossible

4

to say that Congress intended to preclude review in 1947.

Was there not some review under the Back

MR. LYNCH:

I do not know the precise year but my understanding
is that there was no review at all in 1947.

But that theory, that they just used it to

12

keep it out of the Civil Service Commission review, that would

13

not just apply to Constitutional claims.

14

Why does that lead to a conclusion at least that
only Constitutional claims can be -MR. LYNCH:

MR. LYNCH:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. LYNCH:

22

In fact, the Government's position, stated at Page 18

Non-Constitutional claims.
What is your position on that?
Our position is that it does not.

23

of their reply brief in the Court of Appeals, is that the

24

statute does not preclude review of actions alleging that the

25

Agency has failed to follow its regulations.

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

25
1

They accept the rule of Service v. Dulles and

2

Vitarelli v. Seaton, that they have to follow their own

3

regulations.

4

They also accept the fact that you get review of

5

personnel decisions under Title VII, short of termination.

6

Mr. Fried does not really concede it but he suspects

7

that if there were certain kinds of Constitutional claims, this

8

Court would also grant review.

9

I might also say that another provision of the

10

National Security Act

11

discus is the CIA Information Act of 1984, which is an

12

amendment to the National Security Act of 1947.

13

of 1947 which Mr. Fried neglected to

That statute, which was passed after the Sims

14

decision, makes it very clear that the Agency is subject to

15

judicial review under the Freedom of Information Act.

16
17

So in many respects, the Agency is subject to
judicial review.

18

Now, in view of the lack of any textual support for

19

preclusion, any legislative history support, what the

20

Government is really arguing is that the Congress must have

21

insulated this very sensitive Agency from judicial review.

22

But as I have just pointed out, in a number of other

23

significant respects, the Agency clearly is subject to judicial

24

review.

25

So this "rummaging around" argument does not, with

Heritage

2

respect, hold water.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lynch, as I understand the

3

Government's argument, it is not so much that 102(C) in so many

4

words insulates from judicial review but when you apply it

5

through the APA, by reading the APA in the

6

you find that there is no judicial review.

MR. LYNCH:

context of 102(C),

That is why it is so important to focus

on the solitary Constitutional issue that is at stake here.

9

Even if Section 102(C) met the standards of either

10

Section 701(A)(1) or (A)(2), for preclusion, even if it did,

11

and I do not think it did, but even if it did, that would

12

preclude, that would not resolve the question of whether a

13

Constitutional claim is precluded.

14

not

Because quite apart from the Administrative Procedure

15

Act and the exemptions to the Administrative Procedure Act,

16

people who are directly injured by the unconstitutional action

17

of an Executive Agency officer can get review of that claim in

18

the Courts.

19

You need a statute that very clearly, and very, very

20

clearly sets forth an intent to preclude review of a

21

Constitutional claim.

22

QUESTION:

I thought the question presented here, and

23

maybe it is a broader question, but I thought the question

24

presented was whether judicial review is available under the

25

Administrative Procedure Act,

That is true, but you still have to deal

with the cases as they come up here.
I think the way the Government justifies the way it

18
19

has phrased the petition is that they seem to argue that the

20

APA can withdraw jurisdiction to review Constitutional claims.

21

That again is another issue that was never litigated

22

below. And it seems to me that proposition is plainly

23

incorrect.

24

Congress cannot in the APA, or it did not in the APA,
affect the jurisdiction of the Courts to hear claims by

Because the statute leaves the decision of whether

QUESTION:

MR. LYNCH:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. LYNCH:

What page?

27A.
So what Judge Edwards did, in writing the

5

Opinion, was say that to satisfy -- if there is this policy,

6

based on homosexual orientation, in order for the Director to

7

justify the burden on an arguably protected Constitutional

8

interest, the CIA would have to demonstrate that it was

9

necessary or advisable in the interest of the United States to

10

have that policy.
But his invocation of those words from the statute is

11
12

directly in the context of setting out the Constitutional

13

claim.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Lynch, can I ask you a question.

I

don't find in your papers any square allegation that there is

Whether the issue that Judge Edwards says

is the only thing you can litigate was ever raised by you in

7

MR. LYNCH:

8

QUESTION:

9

I don't think it was.
We don't know.
In fact, a lot of your allegations, your

stipulation of uncontested facts, bring out the fact that your

10

client was never advised that there was any requirement about

11

homosexuality.

12

They did not ask him, they did not have any

13

regulations prohibiting it, all sorts of things that seemed to

14

indicate there was no such policy.
MR. LYNCH:

15

The record is in conflict and that is why

16

Judge Edwards sent it back for further development of the

17

facts.

18

22

When Doe told the security officer the very first day
that he was homosexual —
QUESTION:

The Deputy General Counsel said we don't

have any such per se rule.
MR. LYNCH:

First the security officer said there

23

apparently was a per se rule and then the Deputy General

24

Counsel said no.

25

The question is simply in dispute and that is the

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

reason for Judge Edwards reading.
QUESTION:

You say it is in dispute, but I don't

really understand how you raise that particular dispute.

That

is what I haven't been able to find.
I may be missing something.

It seems to me that

Judge Edwards raised that dispute.
MR. LYNCH:
Judge.

There is a lot of merit in what you say,

We were going on substantially different grounds.
QUESTION:

It would seem to me that on the grounds

you were going on, you lost.
MR. LYNCH:

We did.

But the Court of Appeals did

pull out of the fire this one Constitutional claim that we can
go back and litigate.
We did not do very well in the Court of Appeals.
That is for sure.

We pulled our chestnuts out of the fire, so

to speak.
QUESTION:

In fact, if I remember some of the facts

you have, you think that about 9 percent of the people employed
in the Agency are probably homosexuals.
MR. LYNCH:

That is a reasonable extrapolation of the

statistics on the population at large.
QUESTION:

And you are going to contend that there is

a total policy of banning them all.
I don't understand this case.

I would have thought

the Government would have been happy with its victory, would

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

have gone back to the District Court and filed an affidavit
saying we do not have any such policy and that would have been
the end of the lawsuit.
I just don't understand this case.
MR. LYNCH:

I would have thought that the Court would

have declined certiorari on that ground as well.
QUESTION:
MR. LYNCH:

I did, too.
It still could.

And I wish you would.

Let me address the question of whether despite the
lack of statutory or textual preclusion, you can draw from the
structure and purposes of the statute an intent to preclude
review.
First of all, the cases of this Court that apply that
doctrine, that you can look at the details of a legislative
scheme to infer an intent to preclude review are as in Block v.
Community Nutrition Institute, something like the Milk
Marketing Order Program, or in the Commercial Food Workers
Union Case decided last month, the very scheme of the National
Labor Relations Board providing for when review of certain
orders can be taken, and it also provides that certain orders
cannot be reviewed.
QUESTION:

I am sorry to interrupt.

May I ask you

one other question?
A claim that they had such a policy and so forth and
it was unconstitutional, would you say that was a claim for

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

33

review under the APA?
MR. LYNCH:

2
3

That there was an unconstitutional

policy?

4

QUESTION:

Yes?

5

MR. LYNCH:

No.

6

QUESTION:

So the issue that is left in the case is

7

not one embraced within the question presented by the

8

certiorari petition?

9

MR. LYNCH:

10

That is my position.

Let me be more subtle about it. The APA provides for

11

review of Agency actions that are unconstitutional, but, if for

12

any reason review of that question under the APA is not

13

available, you still can get review because the APA does not

14

preclude, and in this case no other statute does as well,

15

preclude review of the Constitutional claim.

16

QUESTION:

What was the claim here?

Was it brought

under the APA only or under other statutes as well?

involved, then you have to invoke the Administrative Procedure

2

Act in order to get the waiver of sovereign immunity.

3

So you are back in the APA.

4

QUESTION:

5

Yes.

After the amendment to Section 702,

there clearly is a waiver of sovereign immunity.

6

This is an action, we proceeded in the traditional

7

manner with an action against the Agency official.

8

we had named the United States as a defendant, under the 9176

9

amendment to Section 702, sovereign immunity would be waived.

10
11

QUESTION:

In a suit under the APA, though.

That is

an APA suit, where sovereign immunity is waived.

12
13

But even if

That is what I am trying to find out, is this an APA
case or not?

14

It smells to me like it is.

MR. LYNCH:

It is both an APA case and it is a non-

15

APA case.

Because even if review is precluded under the APA,

16

we can still bring the Constitutional claim.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. LYNCH:

Even if there is sovereign immunity.
Even if there is sovereign immunity.

19

Sovereign immunity does not bar claims against an individual

20

agency official that he violated the Constitution.

21

QUESTION:

But Mr. Gates, the Acting Director, or the

22

current Director, can't hire this person on behalf of the

23

United States.

The relief you are requesting is not relief that this
individual can provide, unless you invoke the United States.

MR. LYNCH:

Basically, Justice Scalia, I think the

2

position that you are putting forward is in amending Section

3

702, Congress resurrected obstacles of sovereign immunity that

4

this Court had removed in cases against individual officers.

5

You were deeply involved in that statute.

6
7

I can't

believe that that was what Congress was intending.
I was talking about the difference between this

8

statute and the kinds of statutes that have been found in their

9

structure to infer, where an intent can be inferred from the

10
11

structure of the statute, that review is precluded.
And I was making the point that Milk Marketing

12

Orders, the complex scheme for which decisions of the NLRB can

13

be reviewed, are entirely different from this generic statute.

14

The National Security Act of 1947 did a lot more than

15

what Mr. Fried pointed out.

16

created the Department of Defense.

17

It not only created the CIA, it

It combined the War Department and the Navy

kind, dealing with organization of Government agencies.

22

It took the Air Force out of the Army and set up
It set up the National

It is generic legislation of the broadest

It is not a detailed regulatory scheme providing for

23

review of some kinds of actions but not other kinds of actions.

24

And for that reason, that whole line of cases, the Community

25

Nutrition Institute and the Commercial Food Workers Union case

„

last week, is inapplicable in this context.

2

Again, the Government's argument, it seems to me, in

3

the end, is a policy argument, that the CIA ought to be immune

4

from judicial review.
There may be merit in that policy.

5

It may even be

6

that in an up and down vote in the Congress they could prevail

7

on that policy.
But there is no support, through any conventional

8
9
10
11

means of interpretation, that Congress made that decision in
1947.
Therefore, this Court should find this is a statute

12

which does not preclude review, and certainly not review of

13

Constitutional claims.

14
15
16

Unless there are any other questions, I think the
Court has my points.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lynch, if this had been a case against

17

the National Security Agency or the CIA by an employee there, I

18

take it you concede that judicial review would be precluded?

19

MR. LYNCH:

Of non-Constitutional claims.

I

20

certainly do not concede that those statutes have a strong

21

enough indication of an intent to preclude review of

22

Constitutional claims.

23
24
25

But I do concede that they seem to preclude nonConstitutional claims.
The Government makes a lot of the fact that there is

/1

a glaring inconsistency between the Secretary of Defense and

2

the Director of Central Intelligence.

3

Well, that is another one of their "Congress must

4

have meant...", but "must have meant" is not enough in this

5

context.

6

intended in 1947 to preclude review.

7

There has to be clear intention that Congress

And while there may be an anomaly between the extent

8

to which the Secretary of Defense is immune from judicial

9

review and the extent to which the Director of Central

10

Intelligence is immune from judicial review, that is an anomaly

11

to be resolved by Congress and not by this Court, with all

12

respect.

13

Thank you.

QUESTION:

General Fried, you have one minute remaining.

Thank you, Mr. Lynch.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES FRIED, ESQUIRE

17

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

18

MR. FRIED:

Just very briefly, it is quite clear the

19

Court of Appeals did make this decision under the APA.

20

quite clear that they made a decision which was both statutory

21

as well as Constitutional, because they said it was arbitrary

22

and capricious and required the Director to explain why his

23

action was advisable.

24
25

That is a statutory claim.

It is

And of course, the

difference between statutory and Constitutional claims is

thereby pointed out because the Constitutional claim is simply
the statutory claim with the addition of a citation.
There really is no difference.

And I think we are

not arguing about anything very much if we pretend that ends up
making a large point.
The reason we did not simply accept the remand is
because we would have been required to do more than file a
letter.

That letter would have been the beginning of the

litigation, and not its end.
We would say there is no such policy.
QUESTION:

General Fried, is anything in the record

suggesting there is such a policy?
