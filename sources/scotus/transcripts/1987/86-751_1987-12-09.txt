ORAL ARGUMENT OF VESTER T. HUGHES, JR., ESQUIRE

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. HUGHES:

7

Court:
This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Eighth

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Circuit, which denied Arkansas Best Corporation an ordinary

10

loss treatment on the sale of National Bank of Commerce stock

11

it had purchased after 1972, stock that, as the Tax Court

12

expressly found, Arkansas Best purchased solely for business

13

purposes.

14

The decision of the Eighth Circuit is in direct

15

conflict with a number of other decisions of the Circuit Court,

16

Court of Claims, Tax Court, and, indeed, is inconsistent with

17

past decisions of this Court as well.

18

The Eighth Circuit's Opinion challenges the

19

fundamental premise of what is known in the tax world as the

20

Corn Products Doctrine.

21

which an asset is purchased, and not the nature of the asset,

22

that determines whether it is a capital asset or a non-capital

23

asset.

24
25

That is, that it is the purpose for

In doing so, it presents a rather fundamental
question of the entire application of the tax law.

The

1

question of whether taxpayers can rely on the words of this

2

Court, the rulings of the Internal Revenue Service, the words

3

of the Congressional committees interpreting what the state of

4

present law is, and numerous other courts which also have

5

interpreted the language of this Court.
Consistency has long been a cornerstone of our tax

You are not saying the Internal Revenue

Service has always been consistent, are you?
MR. HUGHES:

No, Justice Blackmun.

I don't believe I

could say that.

13

14

Now that I have you interrupted, am I

correct in assuming the Tax Court decision here was not

QUESTION:

MR. HUGHES:

21
22
23

It was reviewed by the full Court.
It was?
It was a regular Tax Court decision, as

contrasted with a memo decision.
QUESTION:

Yes.

It was a regular decision.

But it was not reviewed, in the

technical use of that term, by the Tax Court?

24

MR. HUGHES:

25

that it is not a memo decision.

My understanding, Justice Blackmun, is
It is reviewed by the rest of

2

the Court.
QUESTION:

That is out of my line with my

3

understanding of long standing.

4

MR. HUGHES:

But then, go ahead.

The Corn Products decision actually was

5

a development in a much older line of thinking on the nature of

6

a capital gain.

7

You go back to the 1932 and the Opinion of Justice

8

Stone, in Burnet v. Harmel, and there was interpretation of the

9

1921 Act, as modified in 1924.

The 1921 Act, Congress decided

10

that sales of what had been denominated as capital assets would

11

be treated differently than the sales of other assets, and in

12

defining what a capital asset was, assets acquired and held by

13

the taxpayer for profit and investment, were to be treated as

14

capital assets, for profit and investment, and taxed at

15

preferential rates.

16

In 1924, that language was modified so that it would

17

become clear at that point that a taxpayer's personal assets

18

could have the same treatment.

19

to be treated as in the 1921 Act, and, indeed, in Burnet v.

20

Harmel, the Supreme Court said that there had been no material

21

change when the 1924 Act modified the 1921 Act.

22

But business assets continued

Consistent with this purpose, in 1936 then, the

23

Treasury, in GMC 17322, determined that hedging transactions

24

really were, in essence, insurance, and that they would be

25

treated, when they were entered into for protecting a

Heritage

5
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

taxpayer's manufacturing process, they would be treated as

2

ordinary assets.

3

hedging transactions of a speculator would be treated as a

4

capital asset.

That ruling was very clear to announce that

Therefore, you have the situation that the same

5
6

transaction, precisely the same transaction, had either capital

7

or ordinary treatment, depending on the motive, depending on

8

the motive of the person engaging in the transaction.

9

This was consistent with what the Supreme Court had

10

decided in Burnet v. Harmel, and of course was the prelude to

11

the Court's decision in Corn Products.
In the Opinion authored by Justice Clarke, the

12

13

question was whether Corn Products Corporation, which used corn

14

products in various manufacturing operations, would, by reason

15

of hedging transactions, realize a capital or an ordinary gain.

16

In that case, as the Court will recall, the taxpayer

17

had entered into the hedging transactions in order to protect

18

itself from price increases in corn.

19

escalated, there was protection.

20

And so, technically, it was not under the 1935 GCM.

21

Court said that didn't matter, that the transaction was one of

22

a prudent manufacturer, not one of an investor, not a

23

transaction entered into with an investment or profit motive,

24

if you will, but one directly related to the taxpayer's

25

business.

If the price of corn

That was not a true hedge.

But the

In 1958, then, the Internal Revenue Service issued

1

2

another ruling, the three examples, Revenue Ruling 58-40, where

3

it rules that stocks, bonds, or other securities that were

4

purchased solely for the purpose of obtaining inventory, or for

5

other business purposes — for example, the Government

6

securities that were purchased in order for a bonding

7

requirement to be met — would give rise to ordinary treatment,

8

not to capital treatment.

9

Revenue Ruling 58-40 is in direct conflict with what the

11

Court today, and is in direct conflict with what the Eighth

Circuit determined in this case.

MR. HUGHES:

QUESTION:

Did you cite 58-40 in your original Brief?
I believe we did, Your Honor.

didn't, of course, then the Government doesn't have an

23

opportunity to respond to it.

MR. HUGHES:

You do cite it in your Reply

I am certain that it was cited either in

one of the Amicus Briefs or in our Brief.
QUESTION:

It's in the Reply Brief. In your Reply

Brief.
MR. HUGHES:

4

In the Reply Brief.

The Revenue Ruling,

5

again, clearly indicates that stock can be an ordinary asset if

the principal purpose, if the principal purpose had to do with

7

the business of the taxpayer.

8

QUESTION:

9

Mr. Hughes, may I inquire about this

particular case?

10

MR. HUGHES:

11

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice O'Connor?
I take it that the stock acquired after

12

1972 was listed or referred to in the financial records of the

13

company as an investment.

14

MR. HUGHES:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. HUGHES:

17

Yes, Justice O'Connor.
As an investment.
I think that in terms of where it fitted

on the balance sheet, that that would inevitaby be true.

18

QUESTION:

What if the price of that stock had gone

19

up, and it had been sold?

20

wanted to get capital gains treatment of it?

21

MR. HUGHES:

I suppose the company might have

Yes, Your Honor.

We might very well

22

have been here today discussing the propriety of that

23

treatment.

24
25

QUESTION:

And the IRS would be in the position of

saying no, it ought to be an ordinary gain, do you suppose?

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. HUGHES:

4

It would be if it followed its rulings.

As in Corn Products.
As in Corn Products, or as in Revenue

Ruling 58-40 or as in Revenue Ruling 75-13.
QUESTION:

5

This is a bit of a twist.

Because

6

normally, had there been any kind of a gain, the situations

7

would be exactly reversed, or the positions taken, perhaps.
MR. HUGHES:

8

9
10

And of course, the Internal Revenue

Service did prevail in the Mansfield Journal case, where it was
exactly the reverse of the situation.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. HUGHES:

13

QUESTION:

They had contracts.

So it can cut two ways.
Yes, Justice O'Connor.
Do you think this is of diminishing

14

importance in light of the Tax Code changes and the withdrawal

15

of capital gains treatment altogether?
MR. HUGHES:

16
17

I don't believe so, Your Honor, for two

or three reasons.
You will notice that, both in the Petition for

18
19

Certiorari and in the Brief, of both parties, the importance,

20

the continuing importance was indicated to this Court, indeed,

the capital loss situation.

4

considered in the 1930s, in the early 1930s, when there was

5

some thought of elimination of capital gains, and it was

6

thought that the revenue, because of the stock market crash,

7

the Federal revenues could not stand the loss of revenue which

8

would be incident to allowing capital losses against — what

9

had been capital losses — against ordinary income.

And so taxpayers will have the detriment of

course, at any time of a stock market decline, that would be

12

The second reason I would say so, the Committee

13

Reports relating to the 1986 Act specifically left the capital

14

gains system in place, because Congress was not clear whether

15

it could maintain the 28 percent rate.

16

rate changed, then indeed there should be some kind of

17

modification.

18

And if the 28 percent

The situation is not just that the Courts have

19

followed Corn Products and have developed the reasoning of the

20

profit motive, the importance of the profit motive, a dominant

21

business motive, as contrasted with a profit motive being the

22

distinction.

1975, Treasury suggested to Congress that all capital stock be

taxpayer, which owned a trucking company, a furniture

17

manufacturer, a tire sales company, a retreading company, a

18

computer company, and then it had the interest in the bank,

19

which it had acquired in 1968, it could expand no further in

20

its other businesses unless it divested itself of the stock,

21

because of the Bank Holding Company, which became effective

22

December 31, 1970.

23

It had to divest itself of the stock.

Congress

And either the

And then in 1971, in August, this taxpayer filed with

24

the Federal Reserve a statement that it would divest of its

25

stock.

So it is clear that the taxpayer had no interest in

2

stock it had.

Indeed, it was trying to get rid of the

As the Tax Court found, the stock that it bought,

3
4

after 1972, was solely — and I reiterate the word "solely" —

5

for the protection of its reputation, for its business

6

purposes, because by that time, it was clear that the bank was

7

in financial trouble, and that the taxpayer was going to have

8

trouble selling the stock it already had, much less any other

9

stock that it purchased.
The fact that the taxpayer sold the stock solely for

10
11

business purposes then accords with what had been the

traditional rules as set forth in this Court.

We

MR. HOROWITZ:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The question in this case can be stated very simply.

18

The Internal Revenue Code sets forth limitations on the

19

deductibility of what are called capital losses — that is,

20

losses suffered on the sale or exchange of a capital asset. And

21

the question here is whether the losses suffered by Petitioner

22

on the sale of all of its shares of bank stock in 1975 are

23

subject to those limitations.

24
25

In other words, the question boils down to whether
those shares were capital assets.

I don't blame you.

MR. HOROWITZ:

— from what the Commissioner is

11

relying on from the Corn Products Decision which we did argue

12

for and which we continue to think is correct.

13

The Corn Products Decision did not create this kind

of amorphous judicial exception which throws the terms of

Section 1221 out the window.

MR. HOROWITZ:

The Court said it wasn't true hedging.

23

That was the issue that came before it, whether what was called

24

true hedging in the IRS' interpretation was the only thing that

25

could follow from the inventory exception or whether the sort

within the inventory exception.

and the Second Circuit held there.

That is what the Court held,

The only difference between the so-called true

4

hedging and what actually happened in Corn Products was that

6

the — well, maybe I should back up and talk about the facts of

7

Corn Products a little.
There, the Corn Products Company was engaged in, made

a lot of contracts for selling its corn products at fixed

10

prices.

It did not have a lot of storage capacity for raw

11

corn.

12

1930s was that it had gotten squeezed by rapid rises in the

13

price of corn.

14

at a given price and it had to buy corn at a much higher price

15

than it had anticipated, which led to losses on the sale of its

16

product.

So what had happened to it a couple times in the late

It was already committed to sell its corn oil

So to protect itself against those sort of price

18

rises, what it did was, it bought corn futures, so that it was

later.
Now, the only difference from the true hedge is that

it did not protect itself against a decline in the price of

corn.

5

wasn't what it was worried about, and it didn't really affect

6

the fact that the corn futures were really part of their

inventory control system, and essentially were a substitute for

2

completely remove the incentive or the opportunity for the

3

taxpayers to play a "heads I win, tails you lose" game, because

4

it is still in the taxpayer's interest in many cases to have an

5

investment gain or to have a gain on sale of stock treated as a
<

6
7

capital gain.
To give you an example, suppose a company had

8

$100,000 in regular income from its manufacturing operations

9

and it also had a$100,000 capital loss on the sale of

10

investment stock, that was clearly an investment.

11

-there is a third category of money out there.

12

what we might call Corn Products stock, stock that they would

13

be able to gin up a kind of argument that there was a business

14

purpose for getting it.

15

And suppose

They have some

Well, if they sell that stock at a gain, let's say

16

also a $100,000 gain there, it is in their interest to have

17

that $100,000 be denoted capital gain, because it will then

18

give them an opportunity to offset their $100,000 capital loss

19

that they have on the sale of investment stock.

20

would be that they only have $100,000 in total income whereas

21

if that so-called Corn Products stock is treated as ordinary

22

gain, then a capital loss will not be available to them and

23

they'll have to report $200,000 in income.

So the upshot

So the problem that we identify in our brief of where

It is set forth at Pages 1 to 3 of our Brief.

QUESTION:

And

No, but if Congress had adopted one of

these exceptions after Corn Products, you could argue that

MR. HOROWITZ:

Congress has not said anything about

remarkable, really, because clearly, just as you can see from

1

Mr. Horowitz, you know, if you are right,

2

that the statute as written governs, it is awfully hard to fit

even Corn Products' so-called inventory exception with that,

because those futures weren't inventory.

were something that helped the taxpayer maintain an inventory.

MR. HOROWITZ:

The Court said they

I guess there you are just talking

8

about sort of a narrow versus a broad interpretation of the

statute.

I think the Court found that the purposes of the

10

inventory exception were served by having these futures in, and

11

they pointed out the problems there would be if they were not

12

treated as inventory.

the Court noted that> the taxpayers could decide for themselves

ORAL ARGUMENT OF VESTER T. HUGHES, JR., ESQUIRE

4

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

5

MR. HUGHES:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

6

To Corn Products itself, Justice Clarke's language

7

was:

"Admittedly, Petitioner's corn futures do not come within

8

the literal language of the exclusions set out in that section.

9

They were not stock in trade, actual inventory, property held

10

for sale to customers or depreciable property used in a trade
\

11
12

13
14

or business."

That is Justice Clarke's language.

QUESTION:

Mr. Hughes, do you think your taxpayer

fits within the language of the statute somehow?
MR. HUGHES:

Justice O'Connor, there are two ways

15

that this could be approached, and I think that either way gets

16

us to the correct answer for the purpose of tax administration,

17

as it should be interpreted and applied.

18

The first of these is that you don't get to 1221 if

19

there are certain factors present.

20

that that is what Burnet v. Harmel was all about, because there

21

is no doubt about it that Mr. Harmel sold property.

22

oil and gas leases, he sold seven-eighths interest, of 1932.

23

There is no doubt that in 1955, in the Corn Futures case, that

24

futures fitted within what then was the 58-40 ruling, that if

25

you were a speculator, that that was a capital asset.

Heritage

A good argument can be made

40
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

He sold

You have

1

to look at the motive.
There is no doubt that in P.G. Lake, when Mr. Lake

2

3

and the O'Connor estate sold oil payments, they sold property.

4

But what the Court said was that you didn't get there, that it

5

wasn't 1221 and the language that you would have to go back to

6

is the 1921 Act.

7

Now, you could go a different action to divine the

8

purpose of Congress, and that may be a more palatable way,

9

because this Court has done that, if you will recall, and the

10

reason I went back to 1932, the other way is that you look to

11

see what Congress was trying to tax in one manner and what it

12

was trying to tax in another.

MR. HUGHES:

Justice Scalia, I don't think they would

11
