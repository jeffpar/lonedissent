ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM C. SHOCKEY
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

7
8

MR. SHOCKEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9

please the Court, this Court is called upon in this case

10

first to resolve a question of statutory interpretation,

11

what meaning do we give to 1823(e).

12

urges a very broad reading of the statute.

13

whom I represent, argue a very restrictive interpretation

14

of that statute.

15

The FDIC naturally
The Langleys,

In looking at past decisions of this Court rela­

16

tive to statutory interpretation questions, I note that

17

this Court looks first at the language of the statute,

18

then*?, if necessary, at the legislative history, and finally

19

at policy considerations, and I will take each of those in

20

turn.

21

The language of the statute says no agreement

22

which tends to diminish or defeat, et cetera, et cetera,

23

shall be valid as against the corporation.

24

That is the key word.

25

The statute says no agreement.

No agreement.

The statute does not say no claims.

1

We concede that some of the things that were

2

alleged by the Langleys in their original complaint are

3

agreements that 1832(e) bars, things such as the interest

4

rate being, supposed to have been different from what was

5

in the note, the term of the loany that it would not be due

6

until the property was sold, and that the liability on the

7

note was in rem.

8

agreements at variance with the documents.

9

or concede that representations made by the bank president

10

as alleged relative to the acreage in the tract of land in

11

question or as to the mineral acreage and the status of the

12

mineral rights in the property.

13
14

We concede those things.

QUESTION:

We do not have

Why didn't the bank agree that those -

that much land would be delivered?

MR. SHOCKEY:

QUESTION:

MR. SHOCKEY:

18

Those are

Well, first, the bank, of course —•

They did, didn't they?
— wasn't the true seller of the

property.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. SHOCKEY:

Well, I know, but they made the deal.
If Your Honor will refer to the

21

mortgage itself, which is in the Appendix at Page 29,

22

will see the fact that there were 1,628.4 acres in the

23

mortgage tract.

It is specified in the mortgage.

QUESTION:

What do you want us to look at?

do you find it?

On Page 29 of the appendix is — that

is one of the pages of the mortgage.

the middle of the page there is a reference in the mortgage

itself to the property containing 1628.4 acres.

5

7

QUESTION:

If I recall, right in

And you say that some substantially

lesser acreage was in fact conveyed?
MR. SHOCKEY:

Yes, ma'am, I do.

If you will recall

8

from the allegations in our complaint, the Langleys allege

9

that the property in fact only contained 1522 acres.

10

QUESTION:

In your complaint, did you seek to set

11

aside the transaction or to simply counterclaim for the

12

decreased value of the property?

13

MR. SHOCKEY:

We counterclaimed.

If you will recall,

14

the suit began with a suit on the note by the bank.

15

suit in Federal District Court seeking to rescind the trans­

16

action and to collect treble damages under the Rico statute.

17

This was prior to the time the bank closed.

18

distinguished from all the other FDIC litigation that I have

19

reviewed, and I have tried to review every FDIC case, our case

20

was pending.

Our case was pending at the time that the FDIC

QUESTION:

Mr. Shockey, it seems to me you are

23

saying that a promise is an agreement, but a representation

24

of present fact is not an agreement.

25

promise is any more literally an agreement than is a

It doesn't seem to me a

5

representation of present fact.

2

technical about it, an agreement requires an exchange of

3

promises.

4

you so much interest is any more an agreement than is the fact

5

that I say the land has so many acres.

6

If you want to really be

I don't know why the fact that I say I will charge

Well,, what the case boils down to at

this point is the, and I will explain to you how it is

8

different —

9
10
11

QUESTION:

You argue that the promises are agree­

ments, right?
MR. SHOCKEY:

Promises that Mr. Caughfield as the

12

president of the bank had the capacity to deliver, if you

13

will, interest rate, term of loan, and things of those nature,

14

okay, but Mr. Caughfield wasn't delivering the property.

15

Actually, another seller, another — a seller, a customer of

16

the bank actually delivered the property, actually

17

the mineral interests.

18

tions about the quality of the thing that was to be the object

19

of the sale, not necessarily things that would be as to the

20

qualities and characteristics of the loan transaction itself.

QUESTION:

Mr. Caughfield was making representa­

Why wasn't he promising that that

customer would deliver so many acres?
MR. SHOCKEY:

Excuse me, Your Honor? I didn't

follow your question.
QUESTION:

Why wasn't the officer, the bank officer
6

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

1

promising that the bank's customer would deliver so many acres?
MR. SHOCKEY:

2

We in fact contend that he was

3

promising that there would be.

4

that he was familiar with the tract, and that it would include

5

tha.t many acres of property.

6

QUESTION:

7

Why wasn't that as much an agreement as

anything else?
MR. SHOCKEY:

8
9

He represented that the tract,

Well, Your Honor, the representations

as to how many acres there would be and how many mineral

10

rights he would get were an ingredient, if you will, of the

11

sale between Leenerts Farms, who was the other bank customer,

12

and my clients.

13

of loan, and that sort of stuff were an ingredient of the

14

loan transaction.
You actually have two transactions between different

15

parties.

apparently made by the actual owner of the propertv who sold it

20

to your client?

21
22

23
24
25

or

Well, the promises that you now rely

the representations that you now rely upon were

MR. SHOCKEY:

No.

We allege they were made by the

bank president.
QUESTION:

The owner of the property never said he

had 1600 acres, or whatever it was?
MR. SHOCKEY:

I believe it is alleged in our
7

Acme Reporting Company

3

complaint that the Langleys met the seller at the closing.
QUESTION:

And the document at closing included

this document that you called our attention to?
■s

4

MR. SHOCKEY:

The documents at closing included a

5

sale agreement, a deed, possibly you may refer to at common

6

law, which is included —

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. SHOCKEY:

9

For that number of acres?
Right, and a separate document, a

mortgage, which is the lien instrument under Louisiana law,

10

which also contains the reference to the 1628.4 acres.

11

instruments contain that reference.

12

QUESTION:

Both

I must confess I am kind of puzzled.

13

Why wouldn't that have given them adequate information about

14

the size of the tract?

15

MR. SHOCKEY:

16
17
18
19

Well, the problem is, there was a

representation —
QUESTION:

There was an oral statement earlier that

there was more acreage.

Is that it?

MR. SHOCKEY: No, there was less acreage.

Actually,

20

a survey, as we allege in the complaint, reveals there was

21

less acreage.

In fact, over —

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. SHOCKEY:

24

25

Less than 1628?
Yes, I believe the exact figure is

1522, as alleged in the complaint.
QUESTION:

Why do you have to rely on an oral
8

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4880

1

statement about 1628?

That is in the written documents.

MR. SHOCKEY:

2

Well, I understand.

The mortgage

3

itself is not in the form sanctioned by the statute, as in

4

approved by the board of directors, and this and that and the

5

other.

6

QUESTION:

Yes, but it surely cleared up any — I

7

mean, it surely made it clear that that is the amount of

8

acreage that they were talking about.

9

MR. SHOCKEY:

Well, it surely makes it .clear that

10

that is what the Langleys thought they were buying.

11

with you there.

12

13
14

QUESTION:

I agree

I don't understand, though, why he has to

rely on an oral statement.
MR. SHOCKEY:

Well, would love to rely on my

15

mortgage, and if the Court would rely on my mortgage I would

16

be very enthralled, but the point is, I don't think the mort­

17

gage itself fits the requirements under 1823(e).

18

to have it not only in writing, but you have also got to have

19

it approved by the board, and this and that and the other.

20

QUESTION:

You have got

Well, in the mortgage, I assume the

21

representation as to the acreage is a representation from

22

your client to the bank rather than a representation from the

23

bank to your client.

24

MR. SHOCKEY:

25

QUESTION:

Yes, and —

Isn't that right?

I mean, in the

9

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

1

ordinary mortgage, if there is something wrong with the

2

acreage and it is less than indicated, is it the bank that

3

is somehow responsible?
MR. SHOCKEY:

4

The answer to your question is yes

5

and no, and I will explain.

6

law there.

7

prepared the mortgage instrument is actually representing.

8
9

You get to1 a question of state

You get to a question of who the lawyer who

Now, we allege in our complaint that the lawyer who
prepared the mortgage instrument was the bank's lawyer .

He

10

was the lawyer for the bank.

11

question at that point in terms of who is representing to who»

12

QUESTION:

So you get to a state law

And the mortgage, by the way, that also

13

wouldn't be an agreement, either, the representation as to

14

what the acreage is?

15

MR. SHOCKEY:

The representation contained in the

16

mortgage, you know, that is a document prepared from, if you

17

will, prepared from the same, the sale document.

They have

18

the same appendix with the property description.

So I am not

19

sure we can characterize that as an agreement.

20

document, you know, of course, prepared by the attorney who

21

was representing the bank.

22

QUESTION:

It is a

A mortgage is an agreement, certainly,

23

but you would say

that that portion of the mortgage con­

24

sisting of the representation that there are so many acres

25

in the land, that is not an agreement in and of itself?

1

MR. SHOCKEY:

2

QUESTION:

That is what I believe.

Yes, sir.

Ordinarily a representation of a warranty

3

or whatever you want to call it in a mortgage like that runs

4

from the mortgagor to the mortgagee.

5

said earlier, from your client to the bank, and not vice versa.
MR. SHOCKEY:

6
7

9

Right, and of course, where did my

client get the information?
QUESTION:

8

It would run, someone

He got it from the bank.

Well, what has happened to your lawsuit

against the bank president and the bank?
MR. SHOCKEY:

10

The bank president, for your infor­

11

mation, went into bankruptcy.

in the bankruptcy proceeding,

12

his discharge has been stayed

pending the final outcome of

13

the case.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. SHOCKEY:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

And that is still pending.
That is still pending.

Presumably your client could get some

kind of adjustment on recovery in that lawsuit.
MR. SHOCKEY:

Assuming the gentleman is solvent.

19

Of course, as I indicated, he has gone into bankruptcy.

20

discharge has been stayed pending the final resolution of this

21

case, be it in this Court or filed under remand.

22

QUESTION:

His

Mr. Shockev, tell me if I am mistaken

23

about what you are saying.

In the ordinary contract, any

24

representation of a material fact is automatically a

25

condition on the performance of the other party.
11

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

If that

1

representation isn't complied with, the other party doesn't

2

have to perform.

3

and don't express the condition, the condition is implied

4

anyway.

5

dition in this case had been expressed, and instead of just

6

saying, the banks just saying the land contains so many acres,

7

the bank says, I agree that if the land does not contain so

8

many acres, you will have no obligation under this contract.

Now, you can — if you make a representation

It simply is implied in fact.

Now, suppose the con­

Would that be an agreement?

9
10

MR. SHOCKEY:

11

QUESTION:

That would be an agreement.

So the only failure here - is, what distin­

12

guishes an agreement from a nonagreement is spelling out the

13

condition that exists anyway, whether you spell it out or not.

14

That is the line you would have us draw?
MR. SHOCKEY:

15
16

we are left with.
MR. SHOCKEY:

17
18

I believe that is the conclusion that

Yes, I think that is.

You are com­

fortable with that?
MR. SHOCKEY:

19

Obviously, I am not comfortable with

20

the Superholder in due course statute.

21

is tough.

22

Langleys because their suit was pending seven months prior to

23

the time the bank was closed.

24
25

It is not fair.

The statute is mean. It

It is really not fair to the

Basically what this Court has got to determine is
what is and what isn't beyond the scope of 1823.
12

Acme Reporting Company

We have

1

briefed to death the question of what is a representation and

2

what is a warranty and all that.

3

another source other than possibly my mother for something

4

like that.

I mean, we couldn't cite

5

I think what you've got to do is picture in your

6

mind W.T. Langley and Roy Caughfield standing in the lobby

7

of the Planters Bank in Opelousas, Louisiana, and think how

8

this transaction went down, how — what must one have'said to

9

the other and in what context, gleaned from the allegations

10
11

of the complaint.
I simply don't have time to go through it, but if

12

you will think of that in your mind, I think you will come to

13

have a better appreciation of what was agreed upon between the

14

gentlemen and what was in fact just represented and taken for

15

granted by the other.

Mr. Shockey, let me pursue this same

17

inquiry from a slightly different direction.

I can't seem to find it.
No, sir, it is not in the appendix.

It is in the record, of course.

5

QUESTION:

It is in the record.

6

MR. SHOCKEY:

QUESTION:

I do believe so, yes.

Does it contain the normal boilerplate

that all prior representations are merged into the agreement

Frankly, I cannot recall the provisions

of the instrument in that specificity.

MR. SHOCKEY:

4

5

There still is a question of what does

What is an agreement?

That is the

question.
You say it means a promise.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. SHOCKEY:

Rut it does not mean representations

8

as to the quality of the thing that is the subject of another

9

transaction between the borrower and another party.

10

QUESTION:

More precisely, you say it means only

11

express promises, because when you make a representation of a

12

material fact, there is an implied promise that the deal is

13

off if that fact isn't true..

14

agreement consists only of an express promise and not of an

15

implied promise.

transaction, if I make that express, you say it is an agree­

2

ment, but if I leave it to be implied, it is not an agreement.
MR. SHOCKEY:

3

But the difference between your analogy

4

and our case is, you are talking about you selling to me, two

5

parties to the transaction, and the party making the represen­

6

tation is the seller.

7

representation is not the seller.

8

Roy Caughfield had no obligation, implied or otherwise, to

9

make representations about the qualities of the thing.
QUESTION:

10

In our case, the party making the
The seller is somebody else.

But you are claiming that that represen­

11

tation goes to, goes to the validity of the deal between your

12

client and the bank.

13

with that deal and was part of that transaction as well,

14

wasn't it?

15

You are saying it has something to do

MR. SHOCKEY:

Certainly.

We look at legislative

16

history only if the language of the statute is unclear, as

17

this Court mentioned in the Blum versus Stenson case.

18

legislative history is sparse.

19

history that is available to the Court is actually testimony

given by members of the FDIC and their counsel at committee

hearings.

Are you trying now to show us that the

ordinarily think "agreement" would mean?

MR. SHOCKEY:

Well, all of the Federal Circuit Courts

13

have uniformly recognized that that sort of representation, if

14

you will, the Gunter court went to the point of trying to

15

distinguish between promissory fraud and fraud that did not

involve a promise to deliver at some future point in time.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, Mr. Shockey.

3

We will hear now from you, Mr. Taranto.
ORAL ARGUMENT BY RICHARD G. TARANTO

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

5

MR. TARANTO:

6

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

7

the Court, the question in this case is whether Federal law

8

permits petitioners to rely on unrecorded oral understanding

9

to defeat their straightforward written obligation to repay to

10

the FDIC more than $450,000 in borrowed money.
That question has two parts because there are two

11
12

sources of Federal law, Section 1823(e) and Federal common law.

13

Our primary position is that Section 1823(e) requires peti­

14

tioners to live up to their written obligation.

15

position is that Federal common law requires the same result.

Our secondary

There are two central reasons for both of our

16
17

positions.

First, it is necessary to the scccessful function­

18

ing of the Federal Deposit Insurance system.

19

standing Federal policy and the basic functioning of that

20

system as Congress intended require that the FDIC be

21

entitled to rely on the bank's written documents.

22

is fair.

23

$450,000 at issue here, this case presents a choice between

24

petitioners on the one hand who borrowed the money, the FDIC

25

insurance fund, and possibly other creditors on the other hand.

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Taranto, you say it's fair, but

do you really think Congress meant to totally repeal the

3

doctrine of fraud and the inducement as applied to this kind

4

of transaction?

5

MR. TARANTO:

I think what Congress intended to do

6

in Section 1823(e) was in effect to give by law the status of

7

a holder in due course to the FDIC, and that status would, as

8

Justice O'Connor suggested, preclude the assertion of personal

9

defenses, including fraud

in the inducement.

10

QUESTION:

Fraud in the factum, so-called, survives

11

holder in due course status.

12

MR. TARANTO: That's right.

13

QUESTION:

14
15

How do you distinguish that kind of

fraud from fraud in the inducement?
MR. TARANTO:

Fraud in the factum, as I understand

16

it, occurs when one person fraudulently induces somebody to

17

sign a different document from the document that person

18

thought they were signing, so it is akin to forgery or duress

19

but it is different from what is alleged here, which I think is

20

expressly in the complaint termed fraud in the inducement, that

21

representations were made fraudulently that induced them to

22

then sign the document that they had no difficulty reading or

23

understanding.

There is a case from the

The Court said that was enforceable against the

FDIC because the maker of the note was not negligent in

failing to discover that the bank had fraudulently failed to

12

do what it said it was going to do.

13

QUESTION:

Would it make any difference that the

14

FDIC in this instance did have actual knowledge before it

15

took over the assets?

16

MR. TARANTO:

We don't see how an actual knowledge

17

requirement can be read into the statute.

18

says that no agreement that tends to diminish the value of an

19

asset obtained by the FDIC shall be valid against the FDIC,

20

and it doesn't make any distinction

21

FDIC knew on the eve of the bank closing, perhaps by getting a

22

telegram, as has happened, somebody saying, hey, I have some

23

objection to this, to this defense, and in fact no court, not

24

one, to my knowledge, has suggested an actual knowledge

25

requirement in the context of Section 1823(e).
25

The statute simply

according to whether the

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

When some

1

courts have gone on past 1823 (e) and discussed the scope of

2

federal common law protections, several of them have discussed

3

an actual knowledge requirement.

4

itself an actual knowledge requirement was discussed, but there

5

it was satisfied.
QUESTION:

6

As it happens in Gunter

Mr. Taranto, can a fraudulent promiset

7

a promise that the promisor has no intention of performing,

8

can that constitute fraud in the inducement?

9

MR. TARANTO:

I think it can constitute fraud in

10

the inducement, but it would not be a permitted defense under

11

1823(e).

12

QUESTION:, I understand, but my point is that even

13

if we accept the interpretation of the word "agreement" that

14

the petitioner would have us adopt, we would not have

15

succeeded in establishing fraud in the inducement as a

16

defense.

17

MR. TARANTO: That's right. As I understand

18

petitioner's distinction and the distinction the Gunter

19

Court alluded to and then the Sixth Circuit in the Hatmaker

20

case more explicitly adopted, that distinction would say that

21

certain kinds of fraud in the inducement are barred by

22

1823(e) but certain other kinds are not, depending on

23

whether the fraudulent representation was a factual

24

representation or was a promise to do something.

25

That distinction, too, we think, is simply
26
Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

1

inconsistent with the policies behind 1823(e), those policies

2

being designed to allow the FDIC to look at the bank records

3

and take those records at face value and not have to look

4

outside the bank records.
QUESTION:

5
6

Mr. Taranto,, why aren't those policies

equally implicated by fraud in the execution?
MR. TARANTO:

7

The policies as we understand them are

8

designed to allow people who make — who assume obligations,

9

make a note in this case, to insist that any term that they

10

think is relevant to the note be placed in writing.

wrote up an agreement with the different sized acreage and he

QUESTION:

Well, I know, but the statute doesn't say

12

anything about holder in due course.

13

And if the bank says here is what you are going to sign, and

14

then substitutes another document, there has been an agreement,

15

there has been a representation.

have obliged himself under, so that — however one fits the --

22

that example into the language of the statute, there has never

23

been any attempt by the FDIC to depart radically from the basic

24

distinction in the holder in due course doctrine between the

25

personal and the real defense.

It is only when a borrower has

QUESTION:

fraud in the execution, as I recall, is that the person

That is,'he can't come in and say, you know, the agreement

Or in the statute.

MR. TARANTO:

— or in the statute that Congress

surveyed the whole range of questions that could arise when

the FDIC seeks to enforce a note that it obtains from the bank,

5

and I -might add at this point that that is the primary reason

6

why we think any argument about preemption of common law, if

7

we were to get to that, cannot survive.

Congress was doing in passing Section 1823(e), they were not

Now, it is true that our position, by reading

17

Section 1823(e) to grant the FDIC holder in due course status

18

as a matter of law puts the FDIC in a much more favorable

19

position than the bank itself would be in, but as Justice

20

Jackson said in the D'Oench decision, the corporation, the

21

FDIC, did not simply step into the shoes of local banks.

purposes sought to be accomplished by it can be accomplished

When you talk about the integrity of

banking statements and so forth, ordinarily that would not be

thought to suggest that a statement of a bank showing a note

You wouldn't say that statement lacked

There may be defenses to a note like that.
MR. TARANTO:

QUESTION:

MR. TARANTO;

As against the bank?

Yes.
Yes, and as against the bank officers

12

in this case a fraud defense not only could be asserted but

13

has been asserted and remains alive in this case.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

So I don't see where you get into the

sense of integrity of the bank statements.
MR. TARANTO:

I think what Justice Jackson had in

17

mind when referring to the integrity of banking statements was

18

the FDIC in its several roles as examiner of the institution

19

and then as the insurer that steps in once a bank fails must

20

be able to take those bank statements in effect at face value

21

the way a holder in due course would take a note purchased in

22

good faith at face value.

23

QUESTION:

But the inference from that observation

24

would be that if the FDIC knows that there is no integrity to

25

a bank statement, why should they win, if they know that this
32

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

1

is a false statement?
MR. TARANTO:

2

I think there is a statutory answer

3

and then a policy answer.

The statutory answer is that an

4

actual knowledge requirement simply, we think, cannot be

5

fitted into the language of 1823(e),

6

the courts have agreed to that.

7

like an ordinary holder in due course or good faith purchaser,

8

the FDIC is not in a position to simply walk away from the

9

transaction.

The policy — and all

The policy answer is that un­

The FDIC has certain obligations.

One way or

10

the other it is affected by the value of this asset.

11

it has to pay the deposit insurance up to $100,000 for each

12

depositor, or it has to infuse some of its own money into the

13

system either to assist the bank or to arrange for a new bank

14

to take over the failed institution, but the FDIC cannot

15

simply upon hearing that there is a problem with the asset

16

say, I won't have anything to do with it. The FDIC is in

17

effect an involuntary creditor, and the protections should

18

accordingly be stronger than in the ordinary holder in due

19

course.
QUESTION:

20

Either

Mr. Taranto, the old common law rule

21

under the D'Oench case, would that yield any different result

possibly?

23

which the O'Dench rule would cover — that it would cover

When

14

a bank, an insured institution, fails, the FDIC has several

15

options.

16

option is not to close the bank and pay off depositors, but

17

to try to keep the bank open, and that is done through a

18

purchase and assumption transaction, whereby another bank,

19

usually in the community, takes over the failed institution.

20

That is preferable for a number of reasons.

Congress itself has recognized these advantages.

Even

2

recently, this summer, since the briefing in this case was

completed, Congress added yet a new method by which the FDIC

4

can keep a bank open, create the possibility of a temporary

Act of 1987.
What is critical is that although that option is

preferred under the statute, it may be exercised only if it

5

unlike in the D'Oench case, all we are talking about is

whether petitioners must repay money that wasn't theirs to

12

requirements of the FDIC system require the same results.
Let me say a word finally about the common law

13
14
15

issue.

As I have mentioned —
QUESTION:

Do you think the result in D'Oench would

16

have been different if the FDIC had known that the note was

17

really not a note at all, it was a spurious note?

18

MR. TARANTO:

We think D'Oench either expressly or

19

all but expressly says that the result would not have been

20

different, because it says whether bank examiners were in

21

fact deceived or not is simply irrelevant to the issue.

22

only requirement for deciding that the notemaker as opposed

23

to the FDIC fund should bear the loss is that the notemaker

24

lent themselves to a transaction that would tend to deceive

25

bank examiners.

The

If those facts are enough, then an actual
37

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

1

knowledge requirement is simply irrelevant.

2

Briefly, on the common law issue, our first point,

3

as we suggested in our brief, is that 1823(e) cannot be read

4

as a preemption of common law, of common law making power of

5

the federal courts in these kinds of cases.

6

QUESTION:

7

sort of thing as preemption?

8
9

Well, do you ordinarily speak of that

MR. TARANTO:

Well, I think some of this Court's

cases have spoken about it as preemption.

It is not preemption

10

in the same sense as federal preemption of state law, but what

11

we have here is a general jurisdictional grant by Congress and

12

Section 1819 4th says that any case involving the EDIC arises

13

under federal law.

14

history, we think, or in the statute itself that what Congress

15

was doing here was like what it was doing in the principal

16

cases relied on by petitioner.

17

There is no suggestion in the legislative

Congress did not, as I have suggested, survey the

18

entire realm of possible defenses and make a considered

19

judgment that these and only these defenses were to be

20

precluded, and all other defenses available under state law

21

were to be recognized.

22

preemption is out of the way and that it is acknowledged that

23

if 1823(e) does not itself cover the facts here, that the

24

common law making powers of this Court should lead the Court

25

to reach the same result that the Fifth Circuit reached on

And we think that once the issue of

Under the Kimbell Foods analysis, all

2

three factors, we think, lead to the result, first, there is

3

a need for uniformity in the federal rule because there is a

4

single nationwide deposit insurance fund that is threatened

5

every time there

is a half a million dollar loss threatened.

6

Second, federal policies, as I have tried to explain

7

them and as they are reflected in 1823(e), would be frustrated

8

by disabling the FDIC from relying on bank records.

9

finally, we don't think that there would be a serious inter­

MR. TARANTO: Well, the considerations that an

understand to be a basis of the bargain in writing.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY WILLIAM C. SHOCKEY

17

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

18

MR. SHOCKEY:

When this bill that became this Act

19

moved through the legislative process, it was amended on the

20

House floor, as I recall, to change the word which was

21

"simultaneously" in the original draft, talking about when this

22

agreement must be placed in writing and all that sort of stuff,

23

to the word "contemporaneously."

24

handled the bill on the legislative floor, and he had some

25

remarks which are important not only for purposes of 1823(e)

Record 10731 and 32, he said in part, "Prior to and up to

the time of an unfortunate interpretation of the law it was

believed that all legal agreements entered into by the bank

and obligor were binding on the corporation, FDIC."

He goes on, at Page 732:

"It was never the intention

of Congress to give the corporation a stronger position than

10

that of the bank, and the adoption of the amendment, my

11

amendment, is offered to prove heretofore it was the intent

12

of Congress that any agreement in the absence of fraud is

13

binding on the corporation."

This is a fraud case.
