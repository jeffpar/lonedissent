ORAL ARGUMENT BY RAYMOND D. BATTOCCHI, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. BATTOCCHI:

6

7

the Court:
This case involves the constitutionality of both

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

clauses of a District of Columbia statute initially enacted by

10

Congress in 1938.

11

our argument into three parts.

12

After stating the case we propose to divide

First, we contend that the first clause of the

13

statute, which prohibits the display of specified flags and

14

banners, violates the free speech guarantee of the First

15

Amendment.

16

Second, we contend that the second clause of the

17

statute, which gives the police the power to disperse

18

congregations within these 500-foot zones, violates the First

19

and Fifth Amendments.

20

Our third and narrowest, contention is that both

21

clauses violate equal protection, because the Legislature has

22

allowed parties to labor disputes to utter precisely the same

23

speech and precisely the same conduct that Petitioners cannot.

24

The facts are simple and relatively straightforward:

25

Petitioners are three young political activists.

Heritage

(202) 628-4888

Each wishes

1

to display signs containing messages critical of foreign

2

governments and their policies and views on the public streets

3

and sidewalks of the District of Columbia within 500 feet of

4

the official government buildings they wish to criticize.

5

For example,

some of the Petitioners who wish to

6

display a pro-Sakharov,. or a pro-Solidarity sign on Sakharov

7

Plaza in front of the Soviet Embassy.

8

display the American flag there.

One Petitioner wishes to

Another wishes to display a

“stop the killing" sign in front of the Nicaraguan Embassy.

10

Each Petitioner also wishes to congregate wit^ two or more

11

other people within the 500-foot zones,

12

prohibited from either displaying signs or flags or

13

congregating by Section 1115 of the D.C. Code.

14

and each Petitioner is

There are numerous cases pending in the District of

15

Columbia courts involving prosecutions under both clauses of

16

this statute for displays of signs and congregations at the

17

Soviet and Nicaraguan Embassies.

18

This is a 1983 suit that was instituted in the

19

district courts seeking declaratory and injunctive relief; the

20

district court on cross-motions for Summary Judgment, upheld

21

both clauses of the statute and dismissed the Complaint.

22

The court of appeals in 1973 in the Zaimi case

23

interpreted the first clause of the statute to apply only when

24

there is a "display," of a flag or banner that produces one or

25

more of the enumerated consequences specified later on in the

Heritage

4
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

first clause.

2

narrowing that definition further, construed the first clause

3

to apply only to demonstrations in which signs are displayed

4

designed to bring foreign governments into public disrepute or

5

public odium.

6

In this case, the court of appeals, perhaps

So far as we can tell, neither Respondents nor the

7

federal government challenge that construction.

In other

8

words, under the first clause, the only thing that is

9-

proscribed is the display of a flag or banner or a sign

10

designed or adapted to bring a foreign government into

11

disrepute.

12

We note at the outset that under this construction of

13

the first clause, no violence is proscribed:

14

for Petitioners to demonstrate or for anybody else to

15

demonstrate; it is not illegal under the first clause for

16

anybody to engage in any violent conduct.

17

it is not illegal

There is a reference, and maybe several implications

18

in the brief of the Respondents and the United States'

19

suggesting that the first clause serves an interest in

20

protecting a security of foreign persons and property.

21

court of appeals itself acknowledged that, in fact, the

22

security interests asserted by the government in the court

23

below was insufficient to justify the first clause; according

24

to the court of appeals, the only conceivable interest that

25

would sustain the validity of the first clause over a First

note at the outset that what is involved here is political

out on interests — on issues, involving foreign relations

QUESTION:

But it is not enforcing a governmental

point of view on anyone, not on the United States' governmental
point of view on anyone.
MR. BATTOCCHI:

The United States' governmental point

of view mandated by Congress, is that views critical of foreign
governments are illegal, but views supportive of foreign
governments are no^t;

That "governmental view" is embodied in

the first clause.
As construed by the court of appeals, someone could
stand in front of the Nicaraguan Embassy and hold up a sign
saying,

"We support Daniel Ortega."

on the sign, and the message is,

But if one word is changed

"We oppose Daniel Ortega and

we oppose the Contras," that is then proscribed and it becomes
a criminal offense.

So in our view, the statute is viewpoint-

discriminatory in a very specific sense.
In some cases the Court has indicated that mere
"content-based laws:" as I understand that term it means that a
-- proscription of speech on all subjects except religion, for
example, or all subjects except foreign affairs -- a contentbased distinction is, if not a per-se violation of the First
Amendment, one that raises serious constitutional questions and
requires a compelling governmental interest in order to be
sustained.

In this case we have a narrow proscription:

statute does not prohibit all speech — it does not prohibit

That is true.

no.

argument only because it buttresses our "vagueness" contention,

and also shows in our view that the statute is arbitrary in

terms of the way it is both enforced and written.

MR. BATTOCCHI:

12

Then the statute would not be

13

vulnerable on a — the basis of a viewpoint-discrimination or

14

censorship attack, but the statute would, in our view, be

15

invalid because of its overbreadth.

just when you lump them altogether in a way which does not

2

in connection with an overbreadth argument is narrow:

3

that (a) this statute prohibits only expression and no conduct;

most legitimate interest in outlawing, and secondly —

But are there not other D.C. statutes that

QUESTION:

Yes, and that is the question --

Well, does the government have to put

14

every single prohibition possibly applicable into the same

statute?

MR. BATTOCCHI:

No, Mr. Chief Justice, but that is

exactly our point:

statutes.

our point is, there are other statutes that

This statute prohibits only speech in the first

clause, and unless the prohibition of speech is a governmental

mention our additional contention that the statute is overly

vague:

of the statute is that which is designed to bring a foreign

to Respondents is,

"it prohibits all criticism."

results:

6

letting thousands of people violate the statute at the South

African Embassy with impunity.

8

prosecuting everybody that demonstrates at the Soviet or

But on the other hand are

10

First, it shows that the potential for arbitrary and

11

discriminatory enforcement of the laws, which is an important

12

consideration in any vagueness context, is not a theoretical

13

one, but an active fact.

14

Secondly, in the "equal protection" context, to the

15

extent the government argues that what is at stake here is a

16

compelling governmental interest of great constitutional

17

magnitude, it is relevant in that regard.

18
19

QUESTION:

I frankly do not see which of your three

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Does it challenge the

And the court —

Does it represent the issue of

discriminatory enforcement?
MR. BATTOCCHI:

Yes, as we read Kolender and many of

14

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

the other "vagueness" cases, the primary concern in the

2

"vagueness" context is the potential for arbitrary and

3

discriminatory enforcement.

4

the potential for that, but the reality of it.

5

In our view here we not only have

But also, just from a legal standpoint, in the "equal

6

protection" context, the government's answer to our argument

7

essentially is that the insult-free interest is one of great

8

constitutional magnitude, a paramount value in our

9-

.-constitutional scheme, and in response to that, it is relevant

10

for us to point out that the Record belies that assertion.

11

this interest is as paramount as the government contends, then

12

how can it be that at the one place in the City of Washington,

13

where there has been a great deal of exposure and where our

14

activities are more visible to the world at-large than any

15

place else, at the South African Embassy, they have let

16

everybody violate the statute and get away with it.

17

certainly is relevant to whether the asserted compelling nature

18

of this interest is in fact as important as the government

19

suggests or whether the Record belies that assertion.

20

If

That

If I may, I would like to turn to the grounds upon

21

which the government attempts to defend the first clause:

22

first interest asserted is the "dignity interest."

23

understand the government's position, there is no dispute that

24

this clause cannot be sustained as a reasonable or valid time,

25

place or matter restriction because it is content-based and

15

(202) 628-4888

the

As we

1

therefore, by definition, not a valid time, place or matter

2

restriction.

3

clause serves to further a compelling governmental interest and

4

is narrowly tailored to accomplish that end.

5

interest is the so-called "dignity interest."

6

The government's position is that the first

The compelling

Again, the "dignity interest" asserted by the

7

government is not an interest in the context of speech or the

8

style of expression; it is not the difference between speaking

9

through a loudspeaker system and conveying messages i-n a more

10

delicate way -- the interest is an interest in avoiding

11

political disagreements or political insults.

12

In our view, the simplistic view we take of this

13

issue, the argument that the avoidance of political insults is

14

a compelling governmental interest which can override First

15

Amendment rights, is a contradiction in terms.

16

can tell, even though the Article II makes the President and

17

Commander in Chief, it is clear in the Court's prior decisions

18

that members of the public have a right to politically

19

criticize the President for his conduct in office.

20

Bridges v. California through Linmark v. Virginia, it has been

21

established, as we read the cases, that ordinary members of the

22

public have a right to politically criticize or otherwise

23

criticize judges and Justices for the way they carry out their

24

duties.

Insofar as we

difficult to believe that those who wrote and ratified the

political opponents like King George or other world leaders, in

5

an envelope that immunizes them from criticism.

That is true, but that cuts two ways,

Mr. Justice.

In this connection we are addressing the

14

legitimacy of the insult-free interest.

interest is a legitimate one, for governments and for foreign

16

officials, and it is sufficiently important to override First

17

Amendment rights, then at a minimum, it should be applied

evenhandedly.

applied to people who depend upon picket signs to convey their

views, it is not applied to others who own newspapers or own

television stations, or who are even able to speak orally

insults are permissible everywhere outside the zones, but

demonstrations that were then being conducted near a number of

3

Secretary of State Hull requested that the statute be enacted.

It was drafted by the Chairman of the Foreign Relations

Committee, and the statute has been repeatedly upheld in

litigation in the lower federal courts in the District of

It had the strong support of the State Department:

But Congress and the President apparently

Congress has delegated this matter to

fact has done that.
The Secretary of the Treasury's interest is involved

because the Secret Service provides protection to foreign

So we do not believe that there has been any

And then it later was dropped, was it not?

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, the statute has not been repealed

or affected.

There was a proposal in 1986 to repeal the

statute,-in fact the Senate passed that.

The Congress declined

10

to repeal it.

What Congress did instead was pass a sense of

the Congress' resolution and asked the District of Columbia

government, the Council, to consider whether revisions in the

statute might be appropriate.

finally.

First of all, Congress, as Mr. Schwab mentioned, has

the responsibility and the authority to review statutes passed
by the District of Columbia government, so if this should be
repealed or revised, Congress has the authority to overturn
that.
Secondly, when Congress sent it to the District of
Columbia government, it in no way disclaimed the important
national interest and law of nations underlying it.

In fact,

it recognized that-there were security interests and said that
they may have to be balanced against other interests.
And thirdly, Congress quite specifically said that
the D.C. Council should take this into account with the views
of the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury
because of their diplomatic and security interest in the
matter.
QUESTION:

But that certainly is an abnegation, at

least, of any views by the Congress on the point.

Congress is

basically saying, "well, we really have not made the judgment
that the international interests require this any more."
MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

The judgment — what Congress

said is, "we have not made the judgment that the interests that
underlay the statute in 1938 are no longer in force."

Congress

again — had before it a proposal to repeal this statute and
declined to do it.

So as far as the law, as it now stands,

22-1115 is still on the books as Congress passed it, and the

Heritage

Has the Federal Government made New York

to cooperate with the city police in New York in establishing

appropriate security perimeters around U.N. missions up there.

The

two — two justifications for the statute are for security on

the one hand and the dignity interest on the other.

6

think the security interest by itself is sufficient to justify

the first clause of the statute?

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

9

Do you

Perhaps not in every application.

Certainly the sort of demonstrations that — one category of

10

demonstrations Congress was responding to in 1938 involved

11

picketing by 30 or 40 people or even larger demonstrations.

12

think at that point the security interests coincide with the

dignity interests.

then the security interest may be reduced.

ordinary pedestrian.

you think the dignity interest by itself would be sufficient to

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes I do.

And the dignity —

That is because we do not want to insult

our guests when they are invited here on a diplomatic mission?

that authority.

It would be quite similar in this unique

context to a "fighting words" sort of statute, which is what we

analogize this statute to, words that are particularly likely

18

QUESTION:

So you agree that is the same case as this

statute?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

In this case we are talking

19

about — I think that this case is even stronger where we have

20

a specific diplomatic undertaking in the conventions which

21

Congress recognized in 1938, not to protect any insults in the

22

newspaper or anywhere else, but to protect the premises, and

23

that the purposes of this are related to the diplomatic

immunities that go back 200 years, which are to enable citizens

MR. KNEEDLER:

that would .separately reach that.

10

I would like to make several other points in closing.

11

I do not have this much time:

12

point that Justice Stevens mentioned, at page 14 of our brief,

QUESTION:

--

But have any of them taken either of the

23

two appropriate steps, one a 500 foot buffer zone, or two, no

25

MR. KNEEDLER:

Heritage

Not specifically a 500 foot buffer

43
Reporting Corporation

zone.

As this passage recites, the State Department has been

2

successful in establishing some security perimeter, some space

3

in which demonstrations, including signs, cannot occur.

4

that has happened.

5

under the Vienna Convention, it is sensible to take into

6

account the special sensitivity in this country to giving local

7

police too much discretion in deciding how far away a

8

demonstration should be located or how it should be conducted.
