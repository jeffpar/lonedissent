CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

3

this morning in No. 86-805, Billy J.

We will hear argument first
"B.J." Pinter v. Maurice

Mr. Sparks, you may begin whenever you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRADEN W. SPARKS, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. SPARKS:

8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
10

The case this morning is important because it bears

11

upon the day to day regulation of the securities industry, and

12

it has to do with two issues that concern Section 12(1) of the

13

Securities Act of 1 33 which provides for an express private

14

right of action against any person who offers or sells an

15

unregistered security through the use of the mails or the

16

interstate commerce.

17

I would like to state the questions as follows.

18

First of all, whether the long established definition of a

1

Section 12(1) seller under the Securities Act of 1 33 and

20

Section 12(1) specifically should be modified to incorporate a

21

new threshold requirement that the seller must be motivated,

22

and I would like to stress that word motivated, by a desire to

23

receive a financial benefit for his efforts in order to be held

24

responsible for his conduct.

25

And secondly, whether or not the common law

Heritage

3
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

in pari delicto defense, or perhaps I would prefer to refer to

2

this as the regulatory purpose defense rather than strict

3

in pari delicto defense, is available in a private action for

4

the rescission of the sale of unregistered securities brought

5

under Section 12(1).

6

Just briefly, the statute provides that any person

7

who offers or sells a security in violation of Section 77(e) of

8

this title shall be liable to the person purchasing such

9

security from him, and it goes on to provide for rescission in

10
11

the common law fashion.
To telegraph my position in this case, the Fifth

12

Circuit's addition of a pecuniary benefits test to the settled

13

definition of a seller of unregistered securities is damaging

14

and threatening to the continued regulation of the securities

15

industry in my opinion.

16

that the in pari delicto defense does not apply between

17

co-violators of Section 12(1) is in direct conflict with this

18

Court's ruling in the Bateman Eichler case.

19

And the ruling by the Court of Appeals

I think that the facts in this case are extremely

20

important, and I would like to spend a certain amount of time

21

with regard to the facts.

22

Of course, in the trial court, Mr. Pinter was a

23

Defendant, and Mr. Dahl was one of twelve Plaintiffs.

24

and the other eleven Plaintiffs sought to recover from Mr.

25

Pinter for the sale of unregistered securities.

4
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

Mr. Dahl

The complaint

1

detailed a number of misrepresentations, and concealments, and

2

non-disclosures on the part of Mr. Pinter doing business under

3

the various names of his companies.

4

Mr. Dahl, the Trial Court found, was a California or

5

Texas resident, a real estate broker, and a man whose personal

6

wealth exceeded one million dollars, and whose income

7

approached $250,000 on an annual basis.

8

certain abortive efforts, and I am at paragraph 7 on page 31 of

9

10

certiorari.

11

by Mr. Dahl to become interested in the oil business.

12

The Trial Court detailed certain abortive efforts

I would like to quote from the record.

And I want to

13

make it clear that everything that I quote from the record will

14

be either from Mr. Dahl's testimony who I am in opposition to,

15

or from the testimony of Mr. Gottsch who was called on behalf

16

of Mr. Dahl.

17

any statements made by my client in this case.

I am not attempting to support my arguments by

18

Mr. Dahl testified at the joint appendix, page 105,

19

that he was interested in being in the drilling business, and

20

that he did not have the money that he needed to become

21

involved in the business, and that he hired Mr. Minor whose

22

position was to "raise money", and that is quote.

23

was his job, and this was Mr. Minor who was hired by Mr. Dahl

24

to work for Puma Petroleum and Wrangle Oil & Gas, it was his

25

job to bring investor money.

Heritage

And that it

And Mr. Minor was fired by Mr. Dahl prior to his

2

hiring of a Mr. Kirk when it became known to Mr. Dahl that he

3

had spent $10,000 to obtain a legal prospective, and he was

4

fired on that basis.

5

individual by the name of Mr. Kirk, who was in the Texas and

6

Oklahoma area attempting to acquire leases for Mr. Dahl who was

7

living in California.

10

QUESTION:

And then Mr. Dahl then hired another

Mr. Sparks, was the legal prospectus the

one that would have pertained to the transaction that gave rise
to this suit?

11

MR. SPARKS:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. SPARKS:

14

QUESTION:

15

from what you are telling us?

16

MR. SPARKS:

The record does not say, Your Honor.
Do you contend that it was?
Sir?
Are we supposed to draw that inference

The only inference that I would like the

17

Court to draw is that Mr. Dahl was aware of the need to draw a

18

prospectus in becoming involved in the oil and gas business,

19

and had hired Mr. Minor for that purpose, and fired him when he

20

discovered that he had spent $10,000 in that way.

21

The position of the government, the Attorney General,

22

is that one must be a promoter if one is interested in becoming

23

involved in the business, more a promoter than an investor, and

24

one may be held in pari delicto.

25

And I want to point out that I am trying to isolate

6

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

in my discussion of the facts those facts which would show that

2

Mr. Dahl was desirous of getting into the oil and gas business,

3

and that it was his intention to not be merely a investor at

4

least initially.

5

explained is all that needs to be drawn from that fact.

6

Mr. Kirk was hired after Mr. Minor was fired.

I think that the inference that I have

His

7

job, and this is page 108 from the joint appendix, was to

8

locate, acquire and sell leases.

9

Dahl to Mr. Pinter as a knowledgeable and capable oil man.

And Mr. Kirk introduced Mr.

10

would like to point out that Mr. Kirk, of course, was Mr.

11

Dahl's agent in that introduction.
QUESTION:

12

13

I

You mean he introduced him to his former

employee?

14

MR. SPARKS:

Mr. Kirk, the new employee, introduced

15

Mr. Dahl, his employer, to Mr. Pinter, an oil man, who was in

16

the Oklahoma oil and gas business.

17
18

QUESTION:

I thought that

you were saying that Pinter had previously worked for Dahl.

19

MR. SPARKS:

20

QUESTION:

21

Oh, I misunderstood you.

No, sir.
I am sorry.

I did not follow your

statement as well as I should have.
MR. SPARKS:

22

Mr. Kirk was working for Mr. Dahl.

He

23

found Mr. Pinter in Oklahoma, and introduced Mr. Pinter to Mr.

24

Dahl as a knowledgeable oil and gas man who was working in

25

Oklahoma.

Heritage

7
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

Then Mr. Pinter came to Oklahoma and visited the

2

properties, and looked at the geology, the well logs and the

3

other materials which were assembled in the words of the Trial

4

Court by Mr. Pinter.

5

investigation of the circumstanced decided in the Trial Court's

6

words that there "no way that he could lose investing."

7

And after conducting his own

Now there were two different groups of investments

8

which were made by Mr. Dahl, and I would like to point this out

9

and go into some detail here.

Because again it is important,

10

because it deals with Mr. Dahl's involvement and the extent to

11

which he may be considered to be actively involved in seeking

12

oil and gas business opportunities.

13

After deciding that he wanted to invest with Mr.

14

Pinter, he went up to Kansas where he found his friend, a Mr.

15

Gottsch, who testified for him at the time of trial.

16

Gottsch was in the cattle feeding business, and was an

17

independently wealthy individual.

18

his own words, brought Mr. Gottsch to Oklahoma, and introduced

19

Mr. Gottsch to Mr. Pinter in Oklahoma.

20

introduction, he caused Mr. Gottsch to loan him, Mr. Dahl,

21

$250,000 and to put $250,000 of his own money into the initial

22

three well project that the two men got involved in.

23

Mr.

He contacted Mr. Gottsch, in

And as a result of that

And they, Mr. Dahl and his friend, Mr. Gottsch from

24

Kansas put up the entire $500,000 needed to fund the first

25

three of five wells that will be discussed here.

8

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

They bought

1
2

all of the available interest money in those three wells.
Mr. Dahl put not one penny of his own money into

3

those three wells.

4

and solicited, I believe that it is very fair to say, Mr.

5

Gottsch with regard to that transaction.

6

Dahl then went into business with Mr. Pinter in effect drilling

7

the first three wells.

8
9

He caused Mr. Gottsch to loan him the money

Mr. Gottsch and Mr.

Sometime prior to that, Mr. Pinter had begun the
process of drilling two additional wells.

In the words of Mr.

10

Dahl, he decided that it would be appropriate for him to go to

11

Mr. Pinter and to suggest to Mr. Pinter that he had certain

12

friends and relatives in California who would be very

13

interested in these other two wells, since they seemed like a

14

sure deal as far as he was concerned.

15

And so he went to Mr. Pinter and suggested to Mr.

16

Pinter that he would involve his friends in California.

17

gave him some investment contracts.

18

contracts in hand, some of which were in blank and some of

19

which were made out in the name of Maurice Dahl or assignee.

20

He then took these.

Pinter

He took the investment

They had not been

21

fractionalized.

22

He took them to California, and went to eleven of his friends

23

and sold them interests, and made all representations and all

24

communications to each of the people in California.

25

They were simply blank investment contracts.

QUESTION:

When you say blank investment contracts,

9

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

Mr. Sparks, do you mean that the contracts were all written out

2

but unsigned?
MR. SPARKS:

3

No, sir.

They had blanks in them for

4

the percentage of interest that the investor would buy.

5

had a blank for the name of the investor.

6

instead of a blank, they said Maurice Dahl or assignee.

7

they were blank only in those respects.

8

money, as to the percentage of interest in the various wells,

9

and as to the person who was acquiring the interest.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. SPARKS:

12

QUESTION:

Or in some cases,

While you are interrupted, Mr. Sparks.
Yes, sir.
This transaction with Mr. Gottsch, the

first half that you described, was Gottsch one of the

14

Plaintiffs?
MR. SPARKS:

No, sir, he did not sue.

He testified

16

on behalf of Mr. Dahl, but he was not a Plaintiff in the

17

action.

18

So

As to the amount of

13

15

They

He testified at trial that he was looking, to put it

19

in his words, and this at 113 in the joint appendix, "I was

20

looking to Maurice.

21

not of merit to me."

22

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Whoever he was in business with, that was

What does that have to do with the claims

of the eleven other people?
MR. SPARKS:

The only importance that Mr. Gottsch has

is that I believe that it is very fair to say that Mr. Dahl

10

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

solicited Mr. Gottsch.

2

QUESTION:

3

But if they are not the people that are involved in

4
5

Maybe he solicited a lot of people.

the lawsuit, how does that bear on the lawsuit?
MR. SPARKS:

Well, to me, sir, it is circumstantial

6

evidence of Mr. Dahl's solicitor type behavior.

7

to me that it is fundamental to Section 12(1) of the Securities

8

Act of 1933, especially when understood on its face and also

9

from the legislative history of that Act, and President

And it seems

10

Roosevelt's comments when he introduced the bill and asked that

11

it be passed, that the whole idea was to shift the burden of

12

responsibility on the person who made solicitive type of

13

comments or representational activity in connection.

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

Maybe he did or did not solicit the

15

eleven people involved, but would it prove solicitation of

16

these eleven if he solicited Mr X, Y, Z?

17

MR. SPARKS:

No, sir.

I do not follow that.

But in pari delicto, actually

18

what I referred to as the regulatory purpose defense, the whole

19

issue is to look at what Mr. Dahl did.

20

QUESTION:

Supposedly you proved that he committed an

21

egregious violation with respect to Mr. Gottsch, would that be

22

a defense that Mr. Pinter could assert in the claim?

23

MR. SPARKS:

It would be evidentiary of his conduct

24

in pari delicto; yes, sir.

I might point out, Justice Stevens,

25

that at the Trial Court that Mr. Dahl bore down exceedingly

11

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

hard in attempting to establish that all of these transactions

2

were integrated.
Now on appeal, the position is that these are

3
4

separate transactions.

And I might point out also that the

5

Trial Court found that each of the sales involved from the

6

Defendant to the various Plaintiffs including Mr. Dahl were

7

related.

8

describing the various oil wells and investments.

9

Now Mr. Gottsch's involvement is simply

That was the word that the Trial Court used in

10

circumstantial evidence of Mr. Dahl's attempt to solicit others

11

in the offer, sale and delivery of unregistered securities.

12

The statute being a strict liability statute, clearly

13

Mr. Pinter is responsible under Section 12(1).

14

contended otherwise.

15

be affirmed with regard to the other eleven Plaintiffs.

16

solely with respect to Mr. Dahl, he is asserting the defense

17

that it would be inappropriate and would not further the

18

statutory purpose of allow Mr. Dahl to recover against him,

19

because Mr. Dahl was fundamentally responsible in the words

20

of -- yes, sir.

21
22

QUESTION:

His position is to allow the judgment to
And

May I ask, you are only claiming

in pari delicto insofar as the claim by Dahl against Pinter?

23

MR. SPARKS:

24

QUESTION:

25

It was never

That is correct, Your Honor.
You are not claiming that it has any

bearing on the claims of the other eleven or right to

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

2

contribution or anything like that?
MR. SPARKS:

We did not appeal with regard to

3

12(1) violations as to the others.

4

should be responsible in contribution along with Mr. Pinter to

5

the other Plaintiffs.

6

QUESTION:

MR. SPARKS:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. SPARKS:

13

QUESTION:

16
17
18
19

The securities laws, Your Honor, Section

11, for example, provides for a right of contribution between
joint tort feasors.

15

What is the statutory basis, or is a state

law basis, for your contribution claim?

10

14

We do contend that Mr. Dahl

That is because he is a seller?
Yes, sir.
You claim that he is a seller, and

therefore a joint tort feasor with Pinter?
MR. SPARKS:

That is correct; yes, Your Honor.

Equally responsible for the same statutory violation.
QUESTION:

And the Court of Appeals rejected your

claim that he was a seller?
MR. SPARKS:

Yes, sir.

They invoked a pecuniary

20

benefit test to get around, from my position, in order to

21

substantiate the decision that he was not a seller.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. SPARKS:

And both issues are here?
Yes, sir.

And the Court of Appeals

24

found that his conduct was a substantial factor in the sale of

25

unregistered securities.

Heritage

13
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. SPARKS:

But what?
But that he was not motivated by a

3

desire for pecuniary benefit directly or indirectly, which

4

seems to me to fall right in the face of the Dirks opinion

5

which talks about representational benefit at the very least.

6

And which seems to me on the facts, even the facts as adduced

7

by the Fifth Circuit, to be inappropriate as a conclusion, as a

8

matter of factual conclusion, Your Honor.

9

This was a man who was trying to get into the

10

business and who was also trying in the words of Judge Brown to

11

capitalize his own investment, and thought that it was

12

appropriate to do so by going to California and selling other

13

investors in this very same project.

14

It seems to me to be inappropriate to conclude that

15

he was acting merely gregariously which is what the Fifth

16

Circuit said.

17

Judge Jones happy hour cocktail conversationist type of advice.

18

This was not simply a comment.

19

government, they contend that strongly urging someone to become

20

involved without being motivated by pecuniary benefit

21

constitutes non-seller and non-solicitation conduct.

22

I do not believe that this was in the words of

And in the words of the

I would respectfully disagree with that position.

It

seems to me that fundamental to the Securities Act of 1933 is

24

this concept that the burden must be shifted.

to those people, those kinds of people, sit there with an

some fiduciary responsibility it seems to me to them to tell

5

them the truth.
Now Mr. Dahl's position is I am not a seller, and

6

7

that seems to me to be absurd.

He is a seller.

And the mere

8

fact that he is not directly receiving some pecuniary benefit

9

does not mean that he is not receiving some pecuniary benefit.

10

Certainly, he is, because he is capitalizing the investment

11

that he is trying to become involved in.
QUESTION:

12

Mr. Sparks, I am sorry to interrupt you

13

again.

But you told me that you are relying on Section 11 for

14

the right of contribution.

15

Is this not a Section 12 suit?

16

MR. SPARKS:

17
18
19

It is a Section 12 lawsuit from the

standpoint of the Plaintiffs; yes, sir.
QUESTION:

Section 11 applies to misstatements in

prospectuses, does it not?

20

MR. SPARKS:

21

QUESTION:

Section 12.2.
Section 12 is where you have no

22

registration at all, is it not?

23

MR. SPARKS:

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

to this case, does it?

Dahl lacked any sort of pecuniary gain motivation.
MR. SPARKS:

No, Your Honor, that is not correct.

What the Trial Court found was that Mr. Dahl did not receive a

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD G. TARANTO, ESQ.

4

AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONERS

5
6

MR. TARANTO:

Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it

please the Court:

7

On the in pari delicto question in this case, the

8

Securities and Exchange Commission thinks that the Court of

9

Appeals was wrong to the extent that it ruled that the

10

in pari delicto defense is never available in an action brought

11

under Section 12(1).

12

As I propose to explain in more detail in a moment,

13

and I want to present our views in a manner slightly different

14

from our presentation in our brief, we think that the

15

in pari delicto should be available in certain narrowly defined

16

circumstances.

17

On the second question in the case, we think that the

18

Court of Appeals was right in ruling that a person who solicits

19

a securities purchase may be liable under Section 12(1) along

20

with the person who passed title, but only is the solicitor had

21

some motivation in promoting the purchase other than a friendly

22

desire to further the interests of the buyer.

23

then can he fairly be aligned on the selling side of the

24

transaction.

25

contribution may be available in a Section 12 action.

Because only

We do not take a position in this case on whether

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Taranto, suppose the primary

2

Defendant here, suppose Mr. Pinter, were a philanthropist, and

3

it were shown that he really did not expect to make any profit

4

from this stock, but just to benefit his friends and associates

5

that he was selling their interests in the wells, would that be

6

enough to exempt him from liability under 12(1)?
MR. TARANTO:

7
8

Not when the

issuer is actually the person passing title to the security.
QUESTION:

9
10

No, I do not think so.

No, but he comes under the same language.

I mean he sells or offers.
Why should that be a necessity for the

11

12

in pari delicto but not a necessity for the substantive

13

liability in the first place?
MR. TARANTO:

14

Well, the financial interest test does

15

not go to the in pari delicto defense, but it goes only to

16

whether a person other than the person passing title can also

17

be a seller, and therefore conceivably liable to the other

18

people that he solicits.
QUESTION:

19
20

I understand that, but that is the first

step to establishing the in pari delicto defense.
Why should it be that the issuer need not have that

21
22

kind of motivation, but that someone else in order to be liable

23

must?

24
25

MR. TARANTO:

We think that Section 12 is firmly

rooted in the common law remedy of rescission where financial

Heritage

19
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

interest does not play a role as to the person who passes

2

title.

3

amendment in 1954, and its judicial history prior to that seems

4

to us to make it clear that liability can extend somewhat

5

beyond the person who owned the security before the sale.

6

The history of the development of Section 12, and its

The question then is what kind of limits have to be

7

placed on the extension of liability beyond the person who

8

passed title.

9

but there is an important distinction which we think that the

10

Court of Appeals rightly captured between somebody who simply

11

urges somebody else to get in on a good deal and on the other

12

hand somebody who because of his own interests is properly

13

aligned on the selling side of the transaction.

Solicitation, we think, is part of the statute,

14

We do not think that financial benefit is a -- we do

15

not mean by that something terribly precise or limited in that

16

indirect financial interests can align the individual on the

17

selling side of the transaction just as a commission can.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

But that it not necessary, you say, to

align Pinter on the selling side?
MR. TARANTO:

No.

It seems to me that there are

21

always two people, one person on each of the two sides of a

22

sale, the person who passed title and the person who then owns

23

the security after that transaction.

24

do is establish some limits on the extension of the seller

25

class beyond the person who is unquestionably in that class,

And what we are trying to

20

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

2

namely the person who passed title.
QUESTION:

That is the key then.

If you have title

3

and pass it, it does not matter whether your motivation is

4

beneficent or proper.

5

you are looking only at someone who participated in the

6

offering somehow, you need the motivation.

Whereas if you did not pass title and

7

MR. TARANTO:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. TARANTO:

Yes, I think that is right.

Even if you are an agent of somebody else?
If you are an agent for the seller,

10

there is very likely to be some kind of interest of your own,

11

presumably a continuing relationship with the seller, if you

12

are carrying on the activities for the seller.

13

QUESTION:

Supposing the person holding title is an

14

agent of someone else just for the purpose of holding title,

15

and he passes it when he is told to by his principal?

16

MR. TARANTO:

It sounds to me as though -- I am

17

somewhat confused by who exactly is passing title in the course

18

of that transaction.

19

QUESTION:

Whoever is holding title passes title, and

20

supposing that the person holding title is an agent for that

21

purpose for somebody else?

22

MR. TARANTO:

I think that anybody who is the holder

of title before —

Reporting

(202) 628-4888

Let me

1

try to -QUESTION:

2
3

If I can ask one other question about the

seller.
Is it necessary to be a seller in order to — I mean

4
5

is it not possible that Dahl could not be a seller and

6

nevertheless the defense of in pari delicto would be available?

7

MR. TARANTO:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

And is it also not possible that he could

be a seller and nevertheless the claim of contribution would
fail?

11

MR. TARANTO:

12

QUESTION:

13

Oh, yes, absolutely.

Yes.

So it may be true that we do not have to

decide the seller issue?

14

MR. TARANTO:

That is right.

The Court of Appeals

15

did not decide the underlying legal question whether

16

contribution can ever be available in Section 12.

17

unnecessary to do that, because it thought contribution should

18

not be available in this case even if it could be available in

19

some other Section 12 case.
QUESTION:

20

It found it

Do you also think, Mr. Taranto, that the

21

District Court and the Fifth Circuit did not make the necessary

22

determination about the pecuniary interests that Dahl might

23

have had?

24
25

MR. TARANTO:

Yes, we do.

We think that the District

Court did note that Dahl did not receive any commissions, but

22

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

did not address whether there was some indirect financial

2

interest.

3

particular purchases in order to make his investment

4

profitable, and whether there were other potential purchasers

5

who might have taken the place of these.
QUESTION:

6

7

In particular, whether Dahl would have needed these

that?
MR. TARANTO:

8

QUESTION:
10

So you think that we need to remand on

Yes, we do.

And that means that we have to also

address the merits of the contribution issue?
MR. TARANTO:

11

Well, it seems to us that that issue

12

has not been briefed.

13

Appeals, the Court of Appeals were to address the contribution

14

question and decide that contribution could not be available

15

under Section 12 regardless of the particular financial

16

interest or its absence, that issue would not have to be

17

addressed.

And if on remanding to the Court of

Mr. Taranto, would you do one more thing

24

the difference between the position that you now advocate and

25

the one that you set forth in your brief, because I want to be

Heritage

Would you be sure to explain to me

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

sure that I get that.

2

MR. TARANTO:

The difference I think is really one of

3

emphasis.

To the extent that we suggested in the brief that

4

the first part of our test for the in pari delicto defense was

5

that the buyer had to be more a promoter than an investor, the

6

main thing that I wanted to do was to dispel any misimpression

7

that what we meant by that was a simple comparison, how much

8

did the buyer solicit and how much did he purchase, and that

9

that would somehow automatically answer the question.
By promoter, we mean something broader than that.

10

We

11

mean simply what role did this buyer play in the offering as a

12

whole.

13

in any number of respects, not just soliciting purchases.

14

might have prepared offering material, and he might have been

15

the instigator.

16
17
18

To be a promoter, he might have played an active role

QUESTION:

You mean on the whole and not necessarily

to these particular Plaintiffs?
MR. TARANTO:

That is right.

What we mean by the

19

promoter part of the test is something that focuses on the

20

buyer's role and the offer as a whole, and we then move on.

21

He

QUESTION:

But you would not say in the colloquy that

22

was going between counsel and Justice Stevens that the offering

23

to someone who was not one of the Plaintiffs here is merely

24

confirmatory or circumstantial evidence of the necessary

25

qualification?

MR. TARANTO:

5

QUESTION:

6

If I agree with you that this matter was not found,

that is the financial motivation by the District Court, but I

think that it was found by the Court of Appeals, would we still

have to remand?

10
11

14

Direct evidence.
Direct evidence of a promoter role.

May I ask one more question.

Your brief says that the Court of Appeals did not
find it either, and I happen to disagree with that.
What if I think that the Court of Appeals did find no
financial motivation, but the District Court did not?
MR. TARANTO:

I think that without factual findings

15

by the District Court made in the light of a broad enough

16

understanding of what kinds of financial interests can qualify

17

for this test to align him on the selling side of the

18

transaction that further findings should be made.

19

In particular, there seems to be some disagreement

20

between the majority and the dissent in the Court of Appeals

21

about certain kinds of indirect financial interests and whether

22

they would quality.

Mr. Taranto, I do take it that you

disagree with the Court of Appeals on the standard to be

applied in determining the in pari delicto defense?

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. SPINUZZI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

Congress set them up, and this Court has

And the premise on which we

It is sought here to

Frankly, my first impression was similar, that on a

22

conduct but also in illegal conduct.

2

3

However, it is a rare exception, as stated by this

4

Court, that you will permit that defense, because the normal

5

and general rule is that it will not be permitted.

3

that he is not liable?

4

MR. SPINUZZI:

Both the

Pinter was, because he was the issuer of the securities.

8

10

QUESTION:

Mr.

What would make Dahl liable in your view,

does he have to be the actual seller who transfers title?
MR. SPINUZZI:

That would be one.

Because by being

the actual seller, that would do it.

11

QUESTION:

I am sure that would, but what else?

12

MR. SPINUZZI:

I think that there are other

13

situations.

14

these were unregistered securities, which he did, and he knew

15

that there was a private offering exemption being sought to be

16

proven and Mr. Dahl himself knew that he could avoid and ruin

17

the private offering exemption by his own wrongful conduct,

18

then I think that he could be liable.

19

Let me use an example.

If Mr. Dahl knew that

A person who wants to meet the private offering

20

exemption or the non-public offering exemption as it is

21

technically called has certain restrictions.

22

the exemption provided by Congress to say all right, if you do

The seller is liable to the purchaser, but it does not say

It would be construed, and I think that in

It is an interesting point.

Because at one time the

statute in the definition included sale to include an offer.

17

It was later amended about 1958 and removed that provision.

18

But logically speaking, a person who really actively

19

participates in a sale, and I think that a pecuniary benefit

20

test is applicable.

21

Because very frankly, in the Trial Court, the defense

22

was raised that Mr. Dahl agreed to sell in exchange for a

23

commission.

24

was finally admitted by Mr. Pinter that he was wrong, that he

25

did not pay a commission or agree to pay a commission.

That is pecuniary benefit.

Heritage

It was disproved.

(202) 628-4888

It

So that

1

would be one sense.

2

Another sense would be the way that the SEC has taken

3

the position.

That if he were a promoter of the enterprise,

4

that if he had a financial interest in the actual business

5

himself, that would be different.
We have taken the position that where the purchaser

6
7

of a security has only an interest in a venture as an investor

8

himself that he cannot be a seller to someone else merely by

9

saying, hey, I have got a good deal, I have checked it out and

I think that it is great, you ought to get into it.

is basically what happened here.

And that

Now there was not even any negotiation by Mr. Dahl

with these other people.

The subscription agreement prepared

Mr. Pinter says, hey, you should have told him

Now the critical thing that came up in the testimony

15
16

that really is shocking is Mr. Pinter says that he gave nothing

17

to Mr. Dahl to explain this offering or the three offerings,

18

nothing.

19

but it has nothing to do with the particular well.

20

said that it was to give him an idea of where approximately the

21

wells were located.

22

He gave him one thing as a kind of geological report,
He just

Well, that does not even meet, of course, the

23

registration requirements, and it certainly does not meet the

24

exemption requirements.

specifically said in the subscription agreement that these

which is exempt from registration under the non-public offering

"In reliance upon Rule 146."

And Rule 146

Now if you are going to put the burden on Mr. Dahl

6
7

and say equitably he is estopped and he is in pari delicto

8

because he knew that the securities were unregistered, then so

9

did everyone else who invested in those wells, because they all

signed the subscription agreement and the subscription

agreement is very specific that these are not registered.
But if you are going to charge him with that burden,

12

13

then we should always charge him with the other burden it says,

QUESTION:

Mr. Dahl received a

But the others are not responsible for its

having failed to be a private offering, and the contention here

20

is that Dahl is in part, because he was one of those who

promoted the entire scheme, whether he did it for purposes of

friendship or for purposes of profit.

QUESTION:

MR. SPINUZZI:

No, sir.

Is that your theory?
No, sir.

Why

MR. SPINUZZI:

1

In that case, I would say that he is

2

going to come under the three categories of either an issuer,

3

or an underwriter, or a dealer in securities.

4

definitions are broad enough to catch a person in that

5

position.

Those

As a matter of fact, one of the exemptions from

6
7

registration specifically says if you are not an issuer, and if

8

you are an underwriter, and if you are not a dealer, than you

9

may sell the security.

Now normally, that is a secondary

10

trading type exemption, but it could also count for a normal

issue.

So in those three categories, I think that it would

The Fifth Circuit passed upon the

in pari delicto.
MR. SPINUZZI:

The Fifth Circuit apparently decided

8

that it was of significant enough importance that they would go

9

ahead and rule on it.

10

QUESTION:

And estoppel?

11

MR. SPINUZZI:

And estoppel.

As a matter of fact,

12

estoppel was the main point of Judge Hill.

13

saying -- estoppel, of course, here was he knew or did not know

14

that securities were unregistered.

15

the old case from the Fifth Circuit, Henderson v. Hayden, that

16

they have always applied the standard that you cannot waive

17

your rights under the statute and you cannot be estopped from

18

your rights under the statute even if you have knowledge that

19

they are unregistered.

20

Judge Hill kept

Judge Hill said so what,

Because in this instance, the great white father,

21

Congress, says we are going to protect you, public, from your

22

own ignorance unless the issuer gives you a complete disclosure

23

of all material information.

24

Mr. Investor, it is your tough luck, you take care of yourself.

25

And that is the way that it has been, and really the way that

Heritage

If he gives you disclosure, then

38
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

it should be, because the law imparts the fairness of

2

disclosing the investment opportunity.
QUESTION:

3

Well, Mr. Spinuzzi, it seems to me that

4

under that approach that it would further Congress' objectives

5

to provide a in pari delicto defense to someone who is a

6

promoter and who gets other people to buy these unregistered

7

securities as a promoter, and I think that is what the SEC is

8

arguing.

9

MR. SPINUZZI:

I think that they are trying

10

to — well, the SEC has policy decisions too, and I agree.

11

And their policy decision here is that they would like to

12

enlarge it to cover a promoter in that sense, and I cannot

13

disagree.

14
15

QUESTION:

And it would seem to further Congress'

purposes here?

16

MR. SPINUZZI:

17

QUESTION:

18

Yes.

So the question is whether Mr. Dahl is

indeed a promoter in that sense.

19

MR. SPINUZZI:

20

QUESTION:

I agree.

And perhaps the courts below did not have

21

a chance to focus on that, because at least the First Circuit

22

thought that defense was not available at all.

23

MR. SPINUZZI:

24

they did not focus.

evidence to support such a theory.
So assuming a remand as an example, there is nothing

there in the record for the Court to make a ruling on.

5

is nothing, absolutely zero, to indicate the Mr. Dahl was a

promoter of this, evidentiary-wise or otherwise.

MR. SPINUZZI:

12

QUESTION:

14
15
16

No.

Do you think that it requires Dahl to be a

promoter?
MR. SPINUZZI:

I think that it would.

QUESTION:

Well, that is something different than

what we said in the Eichler case.

18

MR. SPINUZZI:

MR. SPINUZZI:

That is an additional element that is not

17

23

That would

I do not think that you accept the SEC's

11

13

There

That is correct.

But Eichler referred to another section,

is that it?
MR. SPINUZZI:

Eichler was basically talked on the

1934 Act which was a 10(b)(5) fraud action, and we are not

Heritage

40
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

talking about fraud here.

I can understand the exception that

2

this Court made in the Eichler case, and it makes good sense.

3

But in that case, even the Court here did not permit the

4

in pari delicto defense to be used.

5

QUESTION:

Exactly.

6

Why do you need any more in this case?

7

MR. SPINUZZI:

I do not think that we need any more.

8

You see, the wrongful conduct that they are claiming with Mr.

9

Dahl is that he was also a seller to his friends by giving them

10

a tip.
QUESTION:

11

If we say that the in pari delicto defense

12

is available in some circumstances contrary to the Court of

13

Appeals, must we not remand and say, look, here is the right

14

rule, now decide whether it is available on the facts.

15

there are not enough facts, maybe you have to send it back to

16

the Trial Court.
MR. SPINUZZI:

17

If

I do disagree with the SEC on that

18

part.

19

in pari delicto was never permissible in a Section 12(1) strict

20

liability situation.
QUESTION:

21
22

23

I do not believe that the Fifth Circuit said that the

Well, it said that it was not available

here.
MR. SPINUZZI:

Yes, sir, it did.

And the reason that

24

it did is that it said that Dahl was a buyer of all of these

securities, and as a buyer you are talking about so-called

complain.

That is basically what the Court said.

QUESTION:

Absent a showing a Dahl's conduct was

10

offensive to the dictates of natural justice, the unclean

11

hands, the in pari delicto unclean hands are not available.

12

MR. SPINUZZI:

I agree.

And the only thing that I

13

can figure is that he is going back to the historical call it

14

transition of the equitable doctrine.

15

QUESTION:

But did not the Court of Appeals hold in

16

discussing estoppel that to allow the estoppel defense would

17

frustrate the purposes of the Act?

18

MR. SPINUZZI:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

Yes, sir.

And that is one of the requirements also

of in pari delicto indirectly, is that not right?
MR. SPINUZZI:

They have a slightly different

wording, sir, and if I may read my note here on it.

May it please the Court:

I would like to address a couple of questions very

submit outside of the record that there were omissions.

7

findings.
Secondly, I would like to point out in response to

11
12

the questions of Justices Scalia and White that with regard to

the in pari delicto test suggested by the government that they

14

suggest that one ought to be a promoter and somehow be involved

15

in the decision not to register, or involved in the conduct

16

that results in the loss of the exemption.
And I submit that in a 12(1) context, a strict

17
18

liability context, that this puts again the burden on

19

establishing a state of mind that a decision was made not to

register, and that a decision was made to take the transaction
