ORAL ARGUMENT BY HERBERT RUBIN, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

7

9

MR. RUBIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case arises by certiorari to the

10

Appellate Court of Illinois.

11

the gravest issue regarding the continued viability of a

12

highly successful, a real success story among treaties,

13

the Hague Convention on Service of Process, which to date

14

has been recognized and acknowledged to be a simple,

15

effective device to end and remove what was a minefield

16

for litigants, Americans abroad as well as foreign

17

litigants in the United States.

18

It presents, we believe,

What has happened here by the decision in this,

19

in the court below, is that there is a suggestion which

20

has been created, a somewhat cynical suggestion, that

21

service on a foreign involuntary agent has been ruled out,

22

but service on an involuntary agent in the United States

23

is perfectly all right and not within the treaty.

24
25

Respectfully, we believe that this is a
somewhat parochial and provincial approach which is
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

4
1

inappropriate in the area of contract law which involves the

2

world community.

3

QUESTION:

Counsel, suppose that the CEO of

4

Volkswagen Germany were in Illinois for a business meeting

5

for a day and he were served, what result?

6

to comply with the treaty?

7

MR. RUBIN:

Would you have

I think, Your Honor, that you would

8

have to comply with the treaty.

9

treaty contemplates that — and I don't believe that the

10

intention of the contracting parties was that there should

11

be a kind of a hit-or-miss situation with respect to the

12

service of process.

13

I don't believe that the

Service of process is, I think, the quintessential

14

element in the commencement, in the conduct, of a lawsuit

15

which cries out for formality, for a sense of very definite

16

precise kinds of procedures so that a party who is being

17

hailed into court is informed that this is the start of a

18

lawsuit, that this is the time when you have to begin to

19

respond, and that any kind of actions that have to be

20

taken are being taken, and that the idea that the president

21

is running through an airport and some papers pushed on

22

him should trigger that.

23

was not within the contemplation of the contracting parties.

24
25

QUESTION:

We respectfully submit that that

What is the language in the treaty

that you rely on in order to support your conclusion that
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

5
1

the documents would necessarily have to be transmitted

2

abroad as a practical matter?

3

transmitted as a legal matter.

4

MR. RUBIN:

Because they don't have to be

We respectfully submit that in

5

presenting the proposition to the Senate, Mr. Carney, who

6

was the representative of the State Department who presented

7

it, indicated in the broadest terms how this treaty was to

8

be administered and what it's purpose was.

9

He said that for the purpose, for the service

10

of judicial documents abroad, that is, in cases where an

11

action is commenced by a Plaintiff in one country against

12

a Defendant who is in another country; now the juxtaposition

13

is very clear: you have a case where you have a Plaintiff

14

in one country and a Defendant who is in another country.

IS

QUESTION:

But that's not what the treaty says.

16

The treaty says where there is occasion to transmit a

17

judicial or extrajudicial documents for service abroad.

18

MR. RUBIN:

That's right and that, too, is

19

stated in the broadest and most embracing fashion.

20

in all cases where there is an occasion to transmit a

21

document for service abroad.

22

23
24
25

QUESTION:

It says

Even if the company does it

voluntarily, not as a legal requirement?
MR. RUBIN:

Your Honor, please, I believe that

the intention was clear among the contracting parties.
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

And,

6

1

indeed, it was understood by each of the courts that've had

2

occasion to rule on it.

3
4

QUESTION:

irrelevant that the document has to be transmitted abroad?

5

MR. RUBIN:

6

QUESTION:

7

Well, then are you saying that it's

It is not irrelevant at all.
Well, then we have to focus on the

language of the treaty in that clause, don't we?

8

MR. RUBIN:

9

QUESTION:

The expectation, Your Honor -All right.

Then, in the example I

10

give, why is there any necessity to transmit the document

11

abroad?

12

MR. RUBIN:

There is the necessity to transmit

13

it abroad, Your Honor, because the party that's being

14

hailed into court has a right to know precisely what the

15

contentions are against it.

16
17

QUESTION:

It knows.

The president, in the

hypothetical case receives the document in Illinois.

18

MR. RUBIN:

Well, the president is receiving it,

19

Your Honor, on the fly.

20

point is prepared to address that issue.

21

contemplation of the treaty was that there should be the

22

formality.

And the

That's instinct in every aspect of this treaty.
QUESTION:

23

He is not someone who at that

Mr. Rubin, what if Volkswagen

24

Germany had an office — that's the next question — in the

25

state?
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

7
1

MR. RUBIN:

I think, Your Honor, that if it had

2

an office in the state it would have qualified in the state.

3

It would have designated a representative to receive

4

service —

5

6

QUESTION:

No, this is a state that doesn't have

such a thing.

7

MR. RUBIN:

8

QUESTION:

If it had an office in the state -Just has an office in the state.

9

That's all.

10

it has an office there.

11

It hasn't designated anybody as an agent, but

MR. RUBIN:

I think in that respect, also, you

12

have a question as to what kind of an office this is.

13

this is an office where you have a freight forwarder

14

sitting there, it's not the kind of a situation —

IS

QUESTION:

No, this is a big office.

If

This is an

16

office that engages in the full line of the business that

17

the parent company does in Germany.

18
19

20

MR. RUBIN:

Well, that's not the situation,

obviously, Your Honor.
If the corporation has proceeded into the state

21

and set up a structure under which it is conducting —

22

it has essentially removed itself into the state — this

23

would be the type of case, for example, we had in

24

Perkins v. Benquet or the type of case where perhaps you

25

had in the Scophony case, where you now have moved the
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

8
1

Corporation into the state, you would have a different

2

situation.

3

QUESTION:

It's not moved there.

There still is

4

a German corporation.

5

most of their business in Germany, but they have a

6

full-fledged office in the state.

7

MR. RUBIN:

They do a lot of business in Germany,

Your Honor, the expectation and

8

intention still is that the address of the company is in

9

Wolfsburg, Germany, and it's anticipated that service would

10

take place at its office.

11

QUESTION:

Where it's incorporated, is that it?

12

It has to be at its head office?

13

MR. RUBIN:

14

At its home.

Where it is.

That's

where it is.

15

QUESTION:

And you find that in the language of

16

the treaty where there is an occasion to make service

17

abroad?
MR. RUBIN:

18

I think, Your Honor, I find it in

19

terms of the recital by the — in the Senate document —

20

saying that where the action is commenced by a Plaintiff

21

in one country against a Defendant who is in another

22

country.

23

no suggestion in this case -- that Volkswagen was in the

24

United States with offices itself.

25

here is that somehow or other it has created an involuntary

This continues to be —• it is certainly, there is

The only suggestion

1

agent.

2

QUESTION:

Well, that's a dramatic departure then

3

from the way process is ordinarily served on corporations

4

outside of the treaty where, you know, you have to serve

5

some human individual every time when you are serving a

6

corporation.

7

treaty just has dramatically changed that.

8

And, certainly, and you say then that the

MR. RUBIN:

I say, Your Honor, that the treaty

9

contemplates that there be a very, very significant

10

formality in terms of service.

11

created here has been a very efficient, a very simple, a

12

very mechanical device, which was the contemplation of the

13

parties.

14

QUESTION:

And, in fact, what has been

But I just don't understand the

15

principle that you're urging on us as the determinant for

16

when the treaty applies and when it doesn't.

17

if the corporation is in Illinois.

18

corporations are physically present only through their

19

agents.

20

manufacturing plant there and that that would do it.

21

This is just an unprincipled rationale that you're urging

22

upon us.

23

You say: well,

But we know that

You seem to assume there has to be a large

MR. RUBIN:

Respectfully, Your Honor, what

24

we're saying is that the principle is that a formal document

25

should be, was anticipated by the contracting parties to be,
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

10
1

directed with a degree of formality, so that there could be

2

certainty, so that they could put the simplicity or there

3

I

can be an assurance, and that's what was achieved by the

4

parties.

5

expressly by the five contracting parties who are the major

6

commercial nations in the world outside of the United States.

7

You have, of course, the United Kingdom, Japan, France,

8

Belgium, and Germany, which have expressly indicated that a

9

service on an agent outside of the nation is simply not

10

contemplated here.

11
12

Indeed, that's the indication which is set forth

QUESTION:
service of process?

13

MR. RUBIN:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

Unless it's an agent appointed for the

That's right.
But in that situation, the papers

still go abroad.
MR. RUBIN:

But there, again, the treaty

17

expressly provides that there can be a voluntary submission.

18

And this was the contemplation of the treaty.

19

says that if a party voluntarily submits, it's one thing.

20

But there is no voluntariness here.

21

QUESTION:

The treaty

Well, let's assume that there's an

22

office in the state, that the foreign corporation

23

voluntarily set it up.

24

business but they should have.

25

MR. RUBIN:

They haven't qualified to do

Your Honor, if there is a voluntary

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

11
1

submission, if there's a voluntary acceptance, certainly

2

that is within the shared anticipation, the expectation, of

3

the parties.

4

contrary.

5

But the shared expectation here is to the

QUESTION:

So you suggest that if a foreign

6

corporation sets up an office in a state or in such a way

7

that it should have qualified but did not, that that office

8

could be served?

9

And here's an office.

10

have qualified and appointed an agent.

11

It did it voluntarily.

MR. RUBIN:

It set it up.

They're doing business.

They should

They did not.

To the extent that there's a

12

voluntary submission to the acceptance of process, that

13

would be the case.

14

that this is not a case where the Petitioner is seeking

15

to avoid amenability to litigation in this state.

16

And I should point out to you, too,

This is not a case of jurisdiction.

There's no

17

question here of avoiding in any way of being sued and

18

responding to the issues and having a full course hearing

19

on whatever are the basic elements to be decided

20

substantively.

21

QUESTION:

Well, I take it you agree on my

22

example that the foreign corporation could be served

23

through its office in the United States.

24

MR. RUBIN:

25

QUESTION:

Well —
Is that right or not?

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

12

1

MR. RUBIN:

I'm not sure, Your Honor, that I'm

2

in a position to concede that as the intention.

3

talking now about a contract among parties and, to the

4

extent that it has now been expressed formally and, I think,

5

authoritatively in the notes verbal which have been filed

6

and the amicus brief which has been filed, this is the law

7

and this is the understanding of the contracting parties.

8

We're

I'm certainly not in the position to make a

9

concession which is contrary to their, I think,

10

authoritative expression of what their expectation has been.

11

And they give reasons for it, as well.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Rubin, that brings up an issue.

13

You've quoted from the Senate debate on the treaty.

14

is the situation if we think the treaty is clear, that the

15

language is clear, and let's even say all the other parties

16

have interpreted it that way.

17

treaty really means is X.

18

ratification debates, that the executive has simply

19

misrepresented the treaty, and the Senate thinks the treaty

20

means Y, what are we bound by?

21

MR. RUBIN:

What

So, we think what the

But we find in the Senate

I think, Your Honor, you're bound,

22

you're interpreting, you're construing a contract.

23

is a world contract in which the United States made

24

representations to the other contracting parties.

25

suggestion is made here that the United States, perhaps, got
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

This

The

13
1

even the better of the bargain because it was giving up very

2

little and getting very much.

3

of protection for its citizens, the businesses which do

4

business abroad and are sued abroad.

5

construing what the shared intention was, what the shared

6

expectation is, I think that we have to understand that the

7

interpretation given by these other contracting parties

8

has certainly some persuasive effect.

9

articulated by this Court in the Air France case.

10

QUESTION:

Indeed, it got quite a bit

And in terms of

And I think that was

Are you going to answer my question?

11

Do we give the treaty what we think was its meaning despite

12

what we know Congress thought it meant, or the opposite?

13

MR. RUBIN:

I believe the Court has to give the

14

meaning that the Court believes, because this is a federal

question.

16

the way in which it believes that the contracting parties

17

intended.

18

The Court is going to construe the treaty in

Respectfully, also, Justice Scalia, I believe

19

that there's been a patent overstatement as to what the

20

impact was going to be on American law.

21

to the Senate document, it is very clear that the statement

22

was made that this will not make major changes in American

23

procedures with respect to judicial assistance.

24

that's all that was said.

going to be significantly changed.

Again, looking

But then what was it that the other contracting

10

nations intended and what did they carry out and what is in

11

existence?

12

how this works.

13

We say it's uniform.

14

it works.

15

Plaintiff takes his summons and complaint, if required by

16

the foreign country, as it does in Germany — it's

17

translated, there are standardized forms which have to be

18

prepared which are transmitted, it's sent by ordinary mail

19

to the central authority — and from that point on, free

20

of charge, without worry, without care, the central

21

authority takes it and puts it in whatever channels are

22

necessary and affects the service, and you get this

23

certificate —

24
25

I think, if I may just take a moment to indicate
We say it's simple.

We say it's efficient.

And it's striking, the way in which

to any foreign corporation that has not appointed an agent

for service of process within the state.
MR. RUBIN:

Respectfully, I believe that that's

3

what the treaty intended and that is, it was the huge

4

mischief and evil which was sought to be overcome here is,

S

indeed, overcome by this very, very simple procedure.

6

QUESTION:

Let me ask you one more question.

7

Suppose Volkswagen is physically present in, say,

8

the state of New York, with a major corporate office and

9

a manufacturing plant, too.

10

through service of process, serves Volkswagen in New York.

11

What result?

12

MR. RUBIN:

And then the state of Illinois,

Your Honor, again, on the basis of

13

the formal position taken in the note verbal and the

14

amicus brief, I think that the result would be that there

15

would have to be service abroad unless Volkswagen was

16

actually here.

17

But that isn't the case.

We're talking now

18

about a treaty which is going to have the universal

19

application.

20

for example, to a case where there's an attempt to serve

21

an adjuster of an insurance company where you have small

22

companies that are going to be faced with papers which are

23

pushed at them, and then they have to cope with them.

24

We're talking also, Your Honor, about a situation where,

25

expressly, the United States and all of the other parties

We're talking about a treaty that relates,

expectations and the contemplation of the parties at the

instrument that they adopted.

particular case?

QUESTION:

17

MR. RUBIN:

I think, Your Honor, that —
I mean, a case authority.
The Air France case, for example.

I believe also that was indicated in the Aeorospatiale

19

case.

20

which is being addressed --

And particularly where you have a remedial situation

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. RUBIN:

What is a remedial situation?
You have a totally chaotic situation

23

where courts are being burdened with a lot of ad hoc

24

issues that they have to decide whether somebody is —

25

whether this insurance adjuster or this freight forwarder

or this toolmaker — an agent.
QUESTION:

Well, are you suggesting there is

some situations where treaties are made, or laws are passed,

4

that not, quote, remedial, close quote?

5

MR. RUBIN:

No, Your Honor, but I'm saying —

6

QUESTION:

I mean, Congress doesn't act unless

7

they think there's something that needs a remedy, does it?

8

MR. RUBIN:

9

QUESTION:

I understand, Your Honor, but —
So why is one situation different

10

from another so that you would say one situation is a

11

remedial situation whereby inference, perhaps, another

12

situation is not a remedial situation?

13

MR. RUBIN:

Well, I think because in this

14

particular case, all of the commentators indicated that

IS

there was in existence at that time a chaotic situation

16

which had to be remedied, and that there was an expanding

17

area of transnational litigation, and the burdens on the

18

court were being very, very heavily tried, and therefore

19

this was the quintessential situation for remedy and the

20

remedy by this simple device and there's no counterbalancing

21

reason why it shouldn't be used.

22

QUESTION:

May I ask you a question, Mr. Rubin?

23

One of the concerns was that it sometimes hard to identify

24

an involuntary agent.

25

a subsidiary should be treated as an agent or not.

I think you have

problems whether

But even if you apply the treaty procedure for

service of process purposes, aren't you still going to have

that kind of issue?

4

service would have been perfectly all right if you followed

5

the treaty procedure, but nevertheless the Defendant might

have contended that it has no representation within the

MR. RUBIN:

MR. RUBIN:

I don't think that it is clear.
But you don't challenge that?
No, Your Honor, please, the question

of jurisdiction here is not on the basis of doing business.

The question of jurisdiction has to do with whether it's

fair to be hailed into this court.

MR. RUBIN:

No, Your Honor.
It wouldn't?
You have a separate entity.

existence of the separate entities where you have, which

There's no reason for raising that question

Well, let me just ask one thing to

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Very well, Mr. Rubin.

We'll hear now from you, Mr. Ring.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACK SAMUEL RING, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

9
10
11

MR. RING:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
It is the Respondent's position that the Hague

12

Convention for service abroad does not render invalid

13

service in a foreign corporation within the United States

14

when such service complies with due process.

15

The heart of the issue before this Court is the

16

interpretation of the Hague Convention on service abroad,

17

regarding service in a foreign corporation doing business

18

in Illinois, which it owned and so closely controlled.

19

It is, therefore, necessary to look first at the convention

20

which is clear with regard to its scope.

21

Article 1 of the convention states: the present

22

convention, and I quote, shall apply in all cases, in civil

23

or commercial matters, where there is occasion to transmit

24

a judicial or extrajudicial document for service abroad.

25

If the drafters of this convention had intended
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

23

1

the convention to be an exclusive method for service upon

2

foreign nationals, regardless of their presence and their

3

shores, then I believe Article 1 would have simply read:

4

the present convention shall apply in all cases, in civil

S

or commercial matters, involving foreign nationals.

6

Clearly, if the framers would not have intended

7

this treaty to apply to all foreign nationals, they would

8

never have used the clause: where there is occasion to

9

transmit a judicial document for service abroad.

10

QUESTION:

May I interrupt you there?

11

MR. RING:

Yes, Your Honor.

12

QUESTION:

What language was this treaty —

13

18

MR. RING:

QUESTION:

And the word, occasion.

There could

20

be an occasion for a service of a document abroad,

21

couldn't there?

22

opportunity, an occasion on which it might be done, or

23

something like that?

24

MR. RING:

25

What if you read the word to sort of mean

I would say that there's an

opportunity to serve abroad.

MR. RING:

I read occasion to be necessity.

necessity.

That's how you read it.

The intent of the convention, Your Honor, was

to provide a method, facilitate a method, for service abroad.

So the purpose, when you look at all of the —

I couldn't agree more with the Petitioner -- when you look

at the language of the legislatures, the Senate committees,

and the U.S. negotiators, it was never the intent of our

country to give up the domain of the several states laws.

The purpose was, in fact, to permit American

litigants to serve abroad, to serve a person overseas,

16

members of the convention -- which I think there are

17

thirty — the same privilege, the same right, to sue

18

Americans and give them notice over here of litigation

19

when it was pending abroad.
QUESTION:

20

Mr. Ring, do you agree with the SG's

21

position that this treaty did eliminate, however, two

22

things: one, the — what's it called -- French practice,

23

notification au parquet, which is sort of you just serve

24

some functionary in France and can sue anybody by doing

25

that.

Do you agree that it eliminates that?
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

28
1

MR. RING:

I agree that -- I can't pronounce it

2

as you do, Justice — but I do agree that the purpose of the

3

convention, it was a fair — and that's why Article 15 and

Article 16 were —

QUESTION:

Just answer.

MR. RING:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Does it eliminate that?

8

MR. RING:

Yes.

9

QUESTION:

It does eliminate that.

10

MR. RING:

Yes, it does.

11

QUESTION:

Now, how come it eliminates that?

12

MR. RING:

Because prior to this time, there

Does it eliminate that?

13

was no due process built into the notification au parquet

14

as we have in Secretary of State service.

IS

embedded in our particular statute so that there would be

16

an extra requirement of due process.

17

QUESTION:

Well, that's a good reason why it

18

ought to be eliminated.

19

eliminate that but not eliminate this?

20
21

22

MR. RING:

We have that

But why does the text of it

Because it had no affect on our own

domestic policies of service of process.
QUESTION:

Oh, it says somewhere in the treaty

that it can affect internal French requirements as to

what's needed to get proper service but not internal

25

United States requirements?
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

29

MR. RING:

1

The purpose of the notification au

2

parquet, the purpose of the treaty for the civil law

3

countries, was because they were fearful that unless they

4

had some kind of protection that the French, who are using

5

notification au parquet, might, in fact, obtain judgements

6

without giving notification.
QUESTION:

7

I understand and I assume that we were

8

fearful of that, too.

But I can't, for the life of me,

9

figure out how it reaches the one but doesn't reach the

10

other?
MR. RING:

It would reach our Secretary of State

13

QUESTION:

It would reach that, too?

14

MR. RING:

It would if --

QUESTION:

Why?

MR. RING:

If only -- if we had a Secretary of

12

service.

17

State statute which provided for, which would have to have

18

for due process, a requirement to give it extra step --

19

if that extra step of mailing could not be done in our

20

shores, yes, we would have to use the convention.

21

If, on the other hand, it was on our shores,

22

I'm saying we would not have to use the convention.

23

in fact, we had a mailing required to go to a corporation

24

at its principle place of business, or where he's

25

incorporated, and that place was in a foreign country, yes,
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

If,

30
1

we would have to use the convention.

2

QUESTION:

That distinction hinges upon the

3

assumption that the French practice requires, for its

4

effectiveness, that the French functionary transmit the

5

document.

6

you certain that the French practice —

7

And that's being contested by Mr. Rubin.

MR. RING:

Are

The French have recently changed their

8

law in that they now require that there be a transmission --

9

I'm not sure of the complete language requirements of the

10

French law -- but if there would be, in the same method,

11

if they had to send over that transmittal to the United

12

States, if there was no agent over there which they could

13

serve, then, yes, it would have to go through the convention.

14

In the same way that our Secretary of State process would

15

have to be through the convention if there was no way of

16

making that second mailing on our shores.

17

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Ring, if your interpretation

18

is correct, though, there would be no reason why France

19

couldn't return to its system of notification au parquet.

20

MR. RING:

Well, first of all —

21

QUESTION:

None whatsoever.

They're not bound

22

by our due process requirement and there is no due process

23

requirement written into the Hague Convention.

24
25

MR. RING:

That's true.

They could go back and

do that if they wanted to.
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

31

QUESTION:

1

Yes.

And that was exactly one of the

2

things that we had an interest in eliminating and motivated

3

us to participate in the Hague Convention.

4

that method of service of American companies in France.

5

Isn't that right?
MR. RING:

6
7

We didn't like

That's true, Your Honor.

But the

French have recently changed the notification au parquet —
QUESTION:

8

Well, all right, except if your

9

interpretation of this treaty is correct, the French can go

10

back to their old system.
MR. RING:

11

Nothing would prevent that.

We have no control over their internal

12

law.

They have no control of our internal law, nor should

13

they have a right to determine our internal law.
QUESTION:

14

But you agree that one of our goals

15

and purposes in entering into this treaty was to eliminate

16

that notification au parquet.
MR. RING:

17

No.

Our interest, our interpretation,

18

our desire, was to find a method where we could have

19

service abroad because we were having difficulty finding a

20

procedure.

21

courts where we were trying to find a method by mailing.

22

Rule 4(i) started the process in our federal

QUESTION:

Don't you agree that we were also

23

concerned about inadequate methods of service and

24

notification on American companies abroad?

25

MR. RING:

There's no question about it.

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

But the

32
1

fact is there are approximately thirty countries which are

members of this convention, and most of them, the majority,

more than the mojority, entered the convention for the

4

purpose of having this protection against notification au

of those countries agree with us.

MR. RING:

The briefs filed with us in

There are only four countries — there

13

are thirty countries, I understand, who are contracting

14

parties.

15

you use that kind of logic, I would say the majority agree

16

with us.

17

And none of them has stated any objection.

QUESTION:

Well, you can't take the failure to

file a brief here as agreement with you.

19

had anything you could cite?

20

MR. RING:

If

I wondered if you

No, I don't, Your Honor.

All I can

21

say is I have to use common sense, and I would say that if

they really objected strongly they would have possibly also

23

filed briefs, as some of the countries did in deciding

I also might add that because these are diplomatic

the diplomatic notes.

5

in fact, the German government — and I had mentioned to

6

them as the reason for their notes — I say this because if

7

you look at the Belgium note, they say: based on what the

8

Federal German Republic told us about this situation.

9

I don't know -- I'm not privy to the what the discussions

10

were between the German embassy and the other embassies

11

and, of course, if I had privy to that I might have a better

12

answer for you.

13

that.

14

Whether or not they would agree with
And we also don't know, Justice, what,

I'm sorry.

QUESTION:

I don't have any more than

Mr. Ring, can I ask you kind of a

15

common sense, practical question, and get away from the

16

language.

17

What is the burden on an American Plaintiff if

18

we should hold that the treaty — occasion means, you know --

19

means what your opponents say and this is the way to serve

20

foreign corporations and you have to go through this

21

mailing procedure, is that such a big deal?

22

MR. RING:

Well, if mailing was the thing that

23

you would have to worry about alone, I think that would be

24

fine.

25

some question about my wisdom in not using the convention.

But there is a problem in this case.

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

There was

34
1

If you consider, Justice, that it cost me $42.00

2

to file my suit — I mean, forget service cost -- on

3

Volkswagen, if I had to get the translation, which is a

4

requirement of Article 5 of the convention, it would have

5

cost me, for a 42-page complaint, $2,500 to $3,000.

That's

6

common sense to me because that's my client's money.

It's

my money.

10
11
12

I'm trying to do the best I can for my client.
QUESTION:

So what's involved is the cost of

translating the complaint, basically?
MR. RING:

Very expensive.

And there's also

another problem, Justice.
Let's assume that I were to use the convention —

13

and this happened —■ Germany, by the way, has three central

14

authorities.

15

of those procedures.

16

authority and some do.

17

They are the only nation that has requirements
Most countries don't have a central
There's some confusion with that.

However, if the central authority which receives

18

your particular request determines that they can't understand

19

the translation and because I wasn't able to get a real

20

good interpreter, unfortunately, who didn't know law, then

21

the fact would be that they would return it to me.

22

That would mean, under our Illinois law, I have

23

a thirty-day summons life.

And that cannot be changed by

24

a clerk, as the Petitioner suggests, or a Judge.

25

our rule and procedure do not provide for extension of
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

Because

35

the life of the summons.

2

it would be returned, I would have to go through the same

3

process, more expense with translation, and have that sent

4

back to the consular, or whoever is going to be the central

5

authority, and see if they'll accept it this time.
There's problems that would come into a practical

situation.
QUESTION:

8

I can see that theoretically, but I

should think there would be competent translaters

available.
MR. RING:

11

Well, I can show you that we have

12

seen documents where they have been returned.

There's

13

nothing to stop them — any country -- from rejection.

MR. RING:

Like Chicago, Justice.

20

And I think it is initimidating to us, too.

Right.

But I think that when you look at those problems, the fact

22

that you might -- you might turn this convention not into

23

a service convention, but to a dismissal convention.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY JEFFREY P. MINEAR, ESQ.

11

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT.

12
13
14

MR. MINEAR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Volkswagen is fundamentally mistaken in arguing

15

that the Hague Service Convention gives foreign corporations

16

blanket immunity from local service rules.

17

Article 1 states the convention comes into play

18

only when there is occasion to transmit a judicial document

19

for service abroad.

20
21

22

QUESTION:

Well, that isn't the French language

exactly, is it?
MR. MINEAR:

That is correct, Your Honor.

The

23

French language is even stricter than that.

24

essentially, that the convention is applicable only when

25

the document must be transmitted abroad to be served there.
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

And it says,

40

QUESTION:

1

2

It says: doit, which is from devoir.

Meaning should or ought, not must.
MR. MINEAR:

3

Yes.

In this context, it would be.

4

I think the best interpretation would be must or is to be

5

transmitted.

6

does not leave much room for the interpretation that

7

Petitioner's suggest, namely, that whenever there is an

8

opportunity to transmit the document abroad.

9

In any event, it seems quite clear that it

This is, of course, the most natural reading of

10

Article 1.

And it is fully supported by the negotiating

11

history which indicates the drafters left to each state

12

responsibility for determining when a document must be

13

served abroad.
The reporter specifically explained in the

14
15

debates that, quote: one must leave to the requesting state

16

the task of defining when a document must be served abroad.

17

This appears at Negotiating History, page 254.

18

QUESTION:

When the French do that — how can you

19

strike down the French practice?

20

MR. MINEAR:

21

That is what troubles me.

The notification au parquet

practice?

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. MINEAR:

Yes.
That, in fact, was clarified in the

24

report that was prepared by the reporter of the convention.

25

In this report, the reporter noted, and I quote:
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

41

While the strict language of Article 1 might raise the

2

question whether or not the convention regulates notifaction

based on the debates is that the convention would apply —

MR. MINEAR:

8

Well, that's nice.

What do you mean

Is it in the -On the debates — what the reporter,

9

at this point, this appears at Negotiating History, page

10

11

the debates.

12

At that same page, there is also a footnote back to

What the reporter's relying on is on statements

13

from the French and Dutch delegations that au parquet

14

service does include an obligation to transmit the document

15

abroad as part of the service procedure.

16

For example, Mr. Lef of The Netherlands explained,

17

and this is at page 169 of the Negotiating History,

18

translated, quote: There is in The Netherlands a real

19

obligation on the part of the Public Prosecutor's Office

20

and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to transmit abroad --

21

close quote.

22

He also indicated the situation in The

23

Netherlands is, therefore, quote: almost identical --

24

close quote, to that of France.

25

Indeed, shortly after signing the convention,
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

42
1

France amended its Code of Civil Procedure, Article 684

2

through 686, to eliminate any doubt that documents served

3

through this method must be transmitted abroad.

4

QUESTION:

So your position is that it covers any

5

situation in which under the domestic law the document must

6

be transmitted abroad.

7

MR. MINEAR:

8

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.
And you assert that there is no

9

necessity under the domestic law of Illinois here for the

10

agent to transmit the complaint to his principal?

11
12
13

MR. MINEAR:

That is also correct, Your Honor.

That is our position.
QUESTION:

What if Illinois simply says: you

14

can serve this — when you want to serve Volkswagen Germany,

15

you can serve the Secretary of State right here in

16

Springfield?

17

MR. MINEAR:

Illinois, in fact, does leave open

18

that opportunity under its corporation law.

19

that's Section 5.25 of the Illinois Code.

20

I believe

But what it also indicates is that if one serves

21

the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State is under an

22

obligation to transmit those documents abroad.

23

QUESTION:

What if Illinois says, hypothetically,

24

you may serve the Secretary of State here in Springfield

25

and he'll post a notice on the door.
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

43

MR. MINEAR:

1

That would probably be

2

unconstitutional under Wuchter v. — Wuchter.

3

recall the last name of the party, but that's cited in our

4

brief.
QUESTION:

5

6

I don't

But it's a matter of due process and

not of service?
MR. MINEAR:

7

Yes, and that simply indicates that,

8

in fact, Volkswagen has two levels of protection here.

9

First, Illinois statutory law and, second, the due process

10

clause.

11

In short, there's ample protection.
QUESTION:

Due process isn't going to protect

12

American companies abroad from other state's, member

13

state's, rules.

14

MR. MINEAR:

Yes, that's right, Your Honor.

15

But I also, respectfully, submit that interpreting the

16

convention in the way that Petitioner suggests will not

17

protect American corporations, either.

18

corporations are not obligated to follow our interpretation

19

of the convention, and they are not obligated to follow

20

this Court's interpretation of the convention.

21

it appears that some of the foreign governments' positions

22

are somewhat inconsistent with their own law.

23

The foreign

In fact,

For instance, in Illinois, under the Illinois

24

Companies Act of 1985, Section 695 does provide for service

25

upon an unregistered foreign corporation at its place of
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4808

44
1

business in England.

2

would be inconsistent with the convention but, nevertheless,

3

is allowed.

4

Procedure, of Section 690, also provides for service at a

5

place of business or upon any qualified member of the

6

corporation.

7

English courts might ultimately interpret the convention.

8

We're not aware of any decisions from those courts that have

9

interpreted the convention.

10

That, under Petitioner's position,

Likewise, the French's new Code of Civil

Now, we don't know how the French or the

However, we believe, that given, in particular,

11

with France, the language of Article 1 the most likely

12

interpretation would be the interpretation that we, in

13

fact, advance here.
Now, I would like to return to the notification

14
15

au parquet again to clarify another matter of confusion.

16

The convention does not eliminate or remove the

17

notification au parquet.

18

exists in the French Civil Code, of Section 684 through

19

686.

20

In particular, it regulates it under Article 15 of the

21

convention.

22

some confusion about this question of where there is

23

occasion.

24
25

That method of service still

What it does do is regulate that method of service.

Now that also explains why there might be

But, again, it depends on whether or not

QUESTION:

Could you — I don't know whether

13

you have it handy now, but I'd be curious to whether the

14

phrase: had to be transmitted abroad, there is in the

15

French, using the verb devoir,

16
17
18

MR. MINEAR:

I don't have it here, but I believe

that is the past tense of the verb devoir.
We note, further, that there are no substantial

19

policy reasons for rewriting the Hague Convention to

20

protect Volkswagen from the service method employed here.

21

It is certainly not unfair to serve Volkswagen through

22

instate delivery of a summons to wholly-owned and closely

23

controlled subsidiary that conducts Volkswagen's affairs

24

in the foreign state.

25

First, Volkswagen is subject to the Illinois
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

46
1

court's jurisdiction, precisely because it does business in

2

Illinois through that subsidiary and, in fact, the Illinois

3

Appellate Court's decision reflects this in Pages 8 through

4

Page 18 of the Petition Appendix.
Second, Volkswagen has complete control over that

5

6

subsidiary and, therefore, can, and we believe, has, taken

7

the necessary steps to assure that it will receive prompt

8

notice of suit.

9

Third, this service method does not discriminate

10

against foreign corporations because it subjects them to

11

precisely the same requirements as any domestic out-of-state

12

corporation.

13

And, fourth, Volkswagen receives all the

14

protections associated with the due process clause.

IS

is as much, or more, protection than U.S. corporations

16

QUESTION:

For what purpose are they an agent?

18

Suppose I appoint someone an agent and I say: you're an

19

agent for everything except receipt of service of process.

20

I do not want you to be an agent for that and I forbid

21

you to transmit to me any process you receive on my

22

behalf?

Would this Illinois provision —
MR. MINEAR:

Volkswagen has said here, with respect to its wholly-owned

subsidiary.
Heritage Reporting Corporation

Our position is that a state is in a position to

that is a matter of state law.

Others don't.

however, is that the requirements to become an agent for
