86-836, Hazelwood School District

MR. BAINE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case come before the Court to resolve;the issue

12

of whether a school sponsored high school newspaper produced

13

and published by a journalism class as a part of the school

14

adopted curriculum under a teacher's supervision and subject to

15

a principal's review is a public forum for the purpose of the

16

First Amendment.

17

During the 1982-1983 school year, the Hazelwood East

18

curriculum included two journalism classes, Journalism I and

19

Journalism II.

20

successful completion of —

21
22

Enrollment in Journalism II required the

QUESTION:
just posed, did they?

23

MR. BAINE:

24

QUESTION:

25

No Court ever decided that question you

I believe the Eighth Circuit, Your Honor.
I thought that they said that it was not

part of the curriculum.

MR. BAINE:
curriculum.
QUESTION:

3
4

They said that it was not part of the

But your question was whether a journalism

as part of a curriculum is a public forum.
MR. BAINE:

5

The trial court found that it was found

6

that it was a part of the curriculum and was not a public

7

forum.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. BAINE:

I know.
The Eighth Circuit then found that

10

because of the numerous ideas expounded in the paper that it

11

was not a part of the curriculum.

12

the issue that is here before the Court is whether or not the

13

school having adopted a curriculum matter in the teaching of

14

journalism through a textbook and through a classroom setting

15

Where the teacher according to the written curriculum attended

16

both the original teaching involving the textbook course which

17

was Journalism I and then in Journalism II continued with that

18

same class —
QUESTION:

19

And I think that is really

Do you think that just the issue of

20

whether something is part of the curriculum or not is really a

21

question for us?

22

MR. BAINE:

I think, Your Honor, whether or not the

23

matter is a public forum is a matter for you, because this

24

then —

25

QUESTION:

But I do not think that the Eighth Circuit

4

Heritage

1

would have held that yes, this is a part of the curriculum but

2

it is still a public forum.

3

MR. BAINE:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. BAINE:

The Eighth Circuit found -That was not a part of the curriculum.
There was a finding of fact on the part

6

of the trial court, and the Eighth Circuit never really did

7

find that the findings of the trial court were clearly

8

erroneous.

9

opinions that were allowed to be present in there that the

What they did find was because of the diverse

10

hewspaper was in fact a public forum.

11

really reversed any of the findings of fact.

12

'

13

something at the beginning of the school year that said that

14

the publication shall be consistent with the First Amendment or

15

something?

QUESTION:

MR. BAINE:

16

I do not think that they

Well, Mr. Baine, was is it a regulation or

NO, Mr. Justice, it was not that.

On two

17

occasions, there were printed in the paper statements not

18

authorized by the board or anybody who developed in the

19

evidence.

20

Amendment rights of the students would not be abridged.

21

there were articles appearing, one was in 1980 and one was in

22

1982.

But there did appear on two occasions that the First

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. BAINE:

25

QUESTION:

Excuse me, that appeared where?
That appeared in the paper itself.
In the paper itself?

5

That

MR. BAINE:

1

In.the paper itself.

But there was no

2

developed evidence before the trial court how that all came

3

about, and no one was able to find out how that ever got in the

4

paper, but it certainly was not adopted by the board of

5

education.
QUESTION:

6

But it obviously was by the teacher, the

7

journalism class teacher, or it would not have been in the

8

paper, I take it.
MR. BAINE:

9

Right.

And again I would respectfully

10

suggest that the journalism course is taught by the teacher in

11

accordance with the adopted curriculum.

12

stated specifically how it would be adopted, and how the story

13

ideas, and how the course would be developed.

i .

15

of the paper?

QUESTION:

16

MR. BAINE:

17

QUESTION:

And the curriculum

Did it not appear in the editorial section

It,did.
Did not the editorial section of the paper

18

say that the editorials did not represent necessarily the views

19

of the school or the school administration?
MR. BAINE:

20

It did that.

There was a provision in

21

the Hazelwood policies that matters could be submitted to the

22

school newspaper by persons outside such as letters to the

23

editor, which could be and as a matter of fact it was

24

developed.

25

question a letter to the editor which was edited by the teacher

2

infrequently used.

But it was something that was

Basically speaking, the Hazelwood East Spectrum was a

3
4

newspaper that was produced as a result of students

5

successfully completing a journalism course called Journalism

6

I.
QUESTION:

7
8
9
10

'

1

Mr. Baine, let me ask you one more

question.
MR. BAINE:
QUESTION:

Sure.
Do you think that the Eighth Circuit saw

11

this case as kind of an estoppel case where the school board

12

had in effect told the students you are going to have complete

13

First Amendment rights> or do you think that they saw it as a

14

case that it did not make any difference what the school board

15

said, that once you some students over loose on a newspaper

16

that they have got those First Amendment rights whether the

17

school board wants to have it or not?

18

MR. BAINE:

The Concern that I saw in the Eighth

19

Circuit's opinion which was not supported by the findings of

20

the trial court in this case was the many and diverse, articles

21

that appeared in the paper that the Eighth Circuit seemed to

22

find in the record were student initiated or student sponsored.

23

And therefore, having opened the Hazelwood East Spectrum to

24

articles of diverse opinion, the board of education and the

25

principal would then have been estopped --

i

QUESTION:

2

MR. BAINE:

Lost all of its power.
Lost control over the paper.

And we

3

submit that the record that we developed in the trial court and

4

that the trial court found in its 21 findings of fact did not

5

support that, nor did the Eighth Circuit when they found that

6

find anything clearly erroneous in the findings of fact of the

7

trial court.

8
9

So what we have here, again if I may respectfully
continue, is a newspaper which is generated in the second

io

semester by students who have been taught certain values in

11

journalism such as responsible journalism, journalistic ethics,

12

copying, writing, story development, ideas and that sort of

13

thing, and then these students are brought into Journalism II

14

to practice that art under the supervision of that teacher.

15

And in the practice of that art the teacher, as the

16

evidence in the trial court was adduced, the teacher then gave

17

these students story lines to be developed.

18

developed those story lines, and those story lines were then

19

submitted back and forth to the teacher for as many as four or

20

five revisions.

21

The students

Evidence in the trial court indicated by the

22

Respondent's own witnesses that a story, for example, in this

23

newspaper on diabetes was not printed at all.

24

had gone through the process of developing a story on diabetes,

25

but it just was not printed.

8

Heritage Reporting Company
(202) 628-4888

So the student

1

Students were given grades whether they printed a

2

story in this publication: or not.

3

on whether there was ultimate publication or whether their

4

article or their effort was not published.

5

not participate particularly in the writing of articles,: but

6

their major job was in the layout, editing, and other things.

7

So they were graded not only

Some students did

In fact, the three Plaintiffs in this case are not

8

the authors of the story in question, but rather were active in

9

the production of the newspaper as layout editor, and one of

10

the Plaintiffs I think assisted in the design of a graph that

11

was used in the story.

12

In the May 13th issue of the Spectrum,

it was

13

proposed to be a six page newspaper.

14

I think is important in this case is that the teacher who had

15

taught these students, in the fall and was teaching these

16

students in the spring semester on April 29th was granted

17

permission by the board of education to leave education and go

18

get a job, had a better offer in private industry.

19

One additional fact which

The board of education through the administration

20

appointed an administrative level journalism teacher as a

21

substitute teacher.

22

teacher was a highly qualified teacher, and as a matter of fact

23

was the administrative person to supervise journalism.

24

reason that they appointed such a qualified person to do that

25

is that it was at the end of the year,

The trial court found that this substitute

And the

and two responsibilities

9
Heritage
Reporting Company
(202) 628-4888

1

remained of the Journalism II class.
One was the production of the final two newspapers,

2

3

one of which was the May 13th edition, and the other one was

4

the class legacy paper which came out later, both of which

5

according to the testimony were about 90 percent complete when

6

teacher number one left and teacher number two came in.

7

the other was the production of the yearbook, a highly complex

8

project on the part of the students, which needed to be

9

completed.

10
11

And

So the administration sent in a very qualified

teacher.
When that teacher received the articles from the

12

students and reviewed them, he attempted to contact, as the

13

evidence in trial court showed, he attempted to contact the

14

principal about these stories as he had an objection to them.

15

He was unable to do that, so he went and put them into proof

16

and sent the proof to the principal, and asked the principal

17

his opinion about it.

18

And the principal said that those stories because

19

they involved the subject matter that was in them, the story of

20

the three young pregnant ladies who told how they got pregnant,

21

whether they used birth control, the reaction of the father of

22

the child, the reaction of their parents to the pregnancy, and

23

other items, and the article on divorce where a freshman gave a

24

story of why or the recounting of why she believed her parents

25

got divorced and her name was involved, the principal said to

10

Heritage Reporting Company
(202) 628-4888

1

Mr. Emerson, who was then the substitute teacher, what can be

2

done about this.
Now you recall that I stated that it was a six page

3
4

newspaper.

5

court found, and no one has set aside this fact, the trial

6

court found that the principal believed that Mr. Emerson, the

7

substitute teacher, was at the printers and he needed a yes or

8

no answer at this point.

9

if he said no, something had to be done.

10

The principal thought at this time and the trial

If he said yes, it would be printed;

The principal said what could be done, and Mr.

11

Emerson said we can delete page four and five, and make page

12

six into page four, and we have got a four page paper.

13

principal said go ahead and do that, and that is what happened.

14

So the articles that the principal had an objection to were the

15

articles involving the recounting of the tales of the pregnancy

16

of three school girls and the recounting of the tale of why the

17

parents of one of the freshman, in fact several parents of

18

students, but particularly one named freshman's parents got a

19

divorce, were deleted and the paper was then printed and

20

distributed to the class.

21

The

In analyzing the First Amendment issues, the District

22

Court distinguished in this case between privately initiated

23

speech which has strict constitutional rights, and student

24

speech in the context of a school sponsored publication or

25

activity that involved curricula matters.

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Baine, we have not analyzed First

2

Amendment Issues in the school context in public forum terms,

3

have we, have we not usually tested the First Amendment issue

4

by the Tinker test?
MR. BAINE:

5

I think, Mr. Justice, that in looking at

6

Fraser, which decided on the same day, that Fraser had a

7

curricula aspect to it.
QUESTION,:

8
9

But the opinion in Fraser did not turn,

did it, on a public forum analysis?
MR. BAINE:

10

But it did not turn on the Tinker

11

analysis either.

12

the role of the school in inculcating values in students that

13

the school officials had some interest loco parentis in the

14

outcome.

15

principal's interest in protecting.

16
17
18

It turned on the fact of whether or not in

And in this case particularly, you see the

QUESTION:

But did not Fraser analyze the situation

as whether or not the speech had been disruptive?
MR. BAINE:

I think that it analyzed it a little bit

19

differently than that.

20

Fraser other than a few laughs that the speech was disruptive.

21

And I think that the Court decided it on really the content and

22

the people involved in the audience.

23

In fact, there was no indication in

And here is what the trial court did in our case.

It

24

said while that there was nothing in there was really that

25

outstandingly bad, but they reckoned that the principal could

12

Heritage

Reporting

(202) 628-4888

Company

i

understand the school audience as well as anyone else in that

2

some of the information in those articles might make it appear

3

that because it was produced in a classroom exercise that the

4

school in effect had condoned the activities of these children,

5

of these young ladies who had-gotten pregnant, for example.

6

And utmost in the principal's mind —

7

QUESTION:

Even if the school would not appear as

8

condoning it, the school was certainly providing the paper and

9

the ink and the money to write the story, right, which was not

10

the case in Tinker?

11

MR. BAINE:

12

QUESTION:

13

It was their own arm bands in Tinker, they

brought them from home, the school did not provide them?

14

MR. BAINE:

15

about in the school.

16

Well, that is true.

Right.

This was not written and carried

I think that in looking at the story and the way that

17

it was presented in the trial court and not found to be

18

erroneous by the Court of Appeals was the fact that the lead in

19

these three pregnancy stories, the names have been changed to

20

grant these young ladies anonymity.

21

that the principal by reading the article felt that he knew who

22

the children were, who the young ladies were.

23

the case, he felt that others would know who they were.

24

the purpose espoused on the article was to grant them

25

anonymity, the article failed.

And the trial court found

13

Heritage

Reporting

(202)

628-4888

Company

And if that was
And if

1

Now again we have to take this in the context of the

2

fact that the trial court felt that when the principal had the

3

question placed to him by the substitute teacher that he had to

4

make a decision, you know.

5

said I know who these girls are.

6

about the divorce, and he said he know who this girl is and I

7

know who her parents are. I do not think that the parents have

8

had an opportunity to respond, the issue of fairness and

9

balance is missing in that article.

And he looked at the article arid he
He looked at the article

The trial court

10

specifically commented on his finding of the credibility of the

11

principal in that case.
So when you take into consideration the fact that the

12
13

trial court found that,there was a protectable interest even

14

espoused by the article, and that is the girls should remain

15

anonymous and the article did not protect that, we feel that

16

the court found that it was not a public forum, that it was

17

adopted on a curriculum basis, and that as a curricula writing

18

that it was subject to the control of the principal.
The Eighth Circuit really said well, the school can

19

20

only do that when the issue would subject the school to tort

21

liability.

22

only liability was for the invasion of privacy of the girls.

23

And since the girls had given their consent, obviously their

24

privacy could not be invaded.

25

And in this case, the Eighth Circuit felt that the

We differ with that somewhat, since also the article

14

Heritage

Reporting

(202)

628-4888

Company

1

mentioned the parents of the girl, the husband of the girl, the

2

decision of whether or not to use birth control, and how the

3

sexual activities occurred.

4

were interested.

5

So there were other people who

But we do not think that tort liability is really an

6

appropriate standard.

That here the interests that a school

7

has in the well-being of the students far exceeds whether or

8

not the coffers of the district are going to be damaged by the

9

onslaught of litigation.

Although Judge Wolman in his dissent

10

said that the majority's decision in the Eighth Circuit put the

11

school district between the Scylla of suit by the students and

12

the Charybdis of suit by somebody else who was offended by what

13

the students wrote.

14

But still and all, we feel that the true test is

15

whether or not, as expressed in Fraser and similar cases,

16

whether or not the school district has an interest in the

17

well-being and the nurturing of the students who were there.

18

QUESTION:

And you would fix the limits at that point

19

I take it, the limits of what the school and its principal can

20

do, what I am trying to find out is what your standard is?

21

MR. BAINE:

I think that it is similar to the

22

standard, Mr. Justice, as you said in Pico that while there may

23

be some things that cannot be removed from a library, a school

24

can make a decision whether or not those articles or books are

25

suitable for different age groups.

1

In this case, whether or not involving students in a

2

public telling of their life and putting it in a semi-official

3

publication of the school district, I think that is not a hard

4

decision for the principal to make.

5

the family life, the private lives of the family members who

6

make up the patrons of the district, is not appropriate fare

QUESTION:

11

Well, you would go further than that,

12

would you not, you would say that the school could censor the

13

paper if it had a lot of misspelling in it, would you not?
MR. BAINE:

14

Well, that, of course, is the Reinke

15

case, Judge, which the Eighth Circuit rested quite a bit on it.

16

And according to Reinke v. Cobb County, the Federal District

17

Court there found that the Tinker standard applied to school

18

newspapers would not allow the teacher to even correct

19

misspellings.

MR. BAINE:

Well, in the scheme of things, as the

2

journalistic courses are set up at the secondary levdl, the

3

teacher has a lot of control over good taste.

4

things that they were to learn in Journalism I was that

business of taste and the community standard.

think that is best left decided at a local level.

Where that is, I

You would say that good journalists have

good taste, and that you can teach that in a journalism class?
MR. BAINE:

Well, I think that you can teach not good

10

taste, but I think that you can teach an acceptable standard

11

which does not suppress viewpoint, all right, and then allow

12

the student and everybody else to grow as their time and

13

maturity grows.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Baine, supposing in this particular

15

journalism class the faculty and the school board said we are

16

going to let you put out a student newspaper and it is a little

17

bit devoted to journalism, but one thing that we want you to

18

understand above everything else is that the faculty advisor

19

has the absolute authority to censor anything if he is a man or

20

she if she is a woman wants to, it may be arbitrary but if you

21

come into the class that is what you are going to come up with.

22

MR. BAINE:

23

QUESTION:

Well, as a matter of fact -Do you think that would violate the First

24

Amendment if the faculty advisor goes ahead and says look, I

just do not think 'much of this article, it does not suit me?

18

between censorship and editing is that censorship in my opinion

is somebody who is outside of the process who comes irt and says

violated and I want to stop that publication.

QUESTION:

Mr. Baine, what that really adds up to is

no First Amendment protection then in that circumstance, none

Mr.; Justice, I do not believe that there

answered?
MR. BAINE:

But I believe that in assigning a

12

classroom exercise that the overriding interests of academic

13

freedom, you know, in order to teach, that there is a First

14

Amendment right inherent in teaching I think that was indicated

15

in the Ewing opinion that said that somewhere there is a

16

conflict between the academy's right to teach and the person's

17

right to speak.

18

In this case, the academy is the Hazelwood School

20

journalistic standards.

21

endless as to what the technique would be in resolving those, I

22

think that is a balancing between that and absent a viewpoint.

23

And while the argument could be

Now again we go back to the trial court.

Because it

MR. BAINE:

Well, first of all again, I would beg

that the word censorship in the classroom be eliminated.
QUESTION:

Well, forget the label, could they do

that, could you give the authority to the teacher?
MR. BAINE:

I would say that that is not the facts

that we have in this case.

QUESTION:

19

MR. BAINE:

20

QUESTION:

I understand that it is not the facts.
And that is a tough hypothetical.
But what is your answer to it?

I mean you

21

gave one answer to the Chief Justice, and I wonder if that is

22

the answer.

23

MR. BAINE:

The answer is if you can establish

clearly on the part of the school a viewpoint of discrimination

that that would abridge fundamental First Amendment rights.

You cannot have it both ways.

MR. BAINE:

that that is a fact.

That does not help us much.

Let us talk about viewpoint

permit an article that discussed the same topic but seemed to

frown upon that kind of activity, that the principal could not

The principal could not exclude an article

If he allows sexuality to be talked about, he has to

allow both the pros and the cons of adolescence sex to be set

MR. BAINE:

I guess the answer is if it is reasonable

Well, I think that when you balance or

it be totally the same no matter what the faculty or school

MS. EDWARDS:

5

QUESTION:

Fine, they set the

Supposing they set them a little bit

6

differently, and said that this is going to be printed the way

7

that ordinary newspapers are, it does not come out during

8

class, you are going to work on it as an extracurricular

9

activity, but here are the rules.

You are going to be subject

10

to review on your subject of topics, and to take Justice

11

Scalia's example, we want to promote morality as we see it.

12

if you are touching subjects such as high school sex, we will

13

encourage and insist on one point of view rather than another.

14

MS. EDWARDS:

I think that they can do that, but I

15

think that there would be trouble doing it with an

16

extracurricular activity.

17

QUESTION:

18

MS. EDWARDS:

Why?
Well, because I assume that

19

extracurricular means that they are only putting in the money

20

and do not have a journalism instructor there.

21

22
23

QUESTION:

So

Well, supposing that there is an

instructor.
MS. EDWARDS:

Then I think that it sort of falls

24

similarly where we do in the middle.

We are not

25

extracurricular and we are not a laboratory experience only in

26

Heritage

Reporting

628-4888

Company

1
2

the classroom.
QUESTION:

But what does that distinction contribute

3

to the First Amendment argument, the difference between the

4

curricular and extracurricular?

5

MS. EDWARDS:

Access.

The harm that the First

6

Amendment is designed to prevent is that a viewpoint that the

7

government does not like for,any reason is excluded.

8

you have students allowed to make certain editorial control

9

decisions or allowed to have certain access to their expression

And when

10

in the written columns, then the First Amendment applies and

11

that is protected.

12

QUESTION:

Supposing it said the students are to

13

write these pieces and we are not going to write anything

14

ourselves, but the faculty advisor reserves the right to say no

15

to anything that involves taking a position that is morally

16

undesirable for high school students.

17

MS. EDWARDS:

I think that the school board, the

18

principal and superintendent, superiors, can delegate the

19

editorial function to an advisor, and he can exercise that in

20

whichever way he thinks as long as it is not viewpoint based.

21

Now if he says that it is viewpoint based, then I do not think

22

that would be protected.

23

QUESTION:

So the advisor cannot say I reject this

24

article which encourages what I think is immorality in the part

25

of high school students, but I will accept this article which I

27

Heritage

Reporting

(202)

628-4888

Company

1
2

think encourages morality?
MS. EDWARDS:

It does not serve an editorial function

3

and it does not serve an educational interest.

4

that would be constitutional.

5

QUESTION:

I do not think

So you either have to have no school paper

6

or you have to have a school paper that carries articles like

7

smoking pot is fun, that is the constitutional choice?

8
9

MS. EDWARDS:

I do not think so.

I think that you

can allow the school to set up one that is related to their

10

educational interests, so long as they do not tell the students

11

now go and exercise your Tinker First Amendment rights.

12

QUESTION:

13

MS. EDWARDS:

14
15

one or the other.

I do not understand.
I do not think that it only has to be

I mean I think that the school can --

QUESTION:

I could set up a newspaper then and say

16

you are not going to have any articles in it that encourage the

17

smoking of pot, I can do that?

18
19

20

MS. EDWARDS:

If it is viewpoint based, I do not

think that they can.
QUESTION:

They cannot.

So I either have to have no

21

newspaper or I have to have a newspaper that has articles

22

encouraging the kids who go to that school to smoke pot.

23
24
25

MS. EDWARDS:

Along with other viewpoints, yes.

They

have to allow that viewpoint, if that is what you are asking.
QUESTION:

I understand your position now.

28

Heritage

Reporting

628-4888

Company

MS. EDWARDS:

1

I mean I think that the viewpoint

2

discrimination is sort of a key to what they did in this case.

And it reminds me of something that you asked about of Mr.

4

Baine.

5

trauma, leaves scars, do not ever do this, it has nothing to do

6

with, you know, being a good person in school.

7

article says I am happy having this baby.

8

whether the principal intended it or not, was to leave out that

9

what he perceived, which you categorized as a moral choice in

The 1977 article on pregnancy said this is horrible,

The 1987

And the effect,

10

some sense, to leave out that one viewpoint that that one

11

student had which said, you know, this is okay for me today.

12

And to only allow -- because for some arbitrary reason this

13

article on pregnancy was allowed ten years before -- to only

14

allow the viewpoint that this is a horrible thing, and do not

15

dare go and do anything like this if you want to be a decent

16

person.

17

QUESTION:

What about teaching in the school, I

18

presume that you could try to teach the students that smoking

19

pot is no good or could you, would you have to have a teacher

20

come up and give the other side and say on the other hand maybe

21

smoking pot is good?

22

23
24
25

MS. EDWARDS:

I do not think that you can pair a

newspaper with what they teach in social studies.
QUESTION:

Why can the school enforce a point of view

in the one case and not in the other?

29
Heritage Reporting Company

Because student expression as opposed

difference.

QUESTION:

11

So the only way to avoid all of the good

12

stuff that you are doing in the classroom teaching them that

13

smoking pot is no good is not to have a student newspaper, that

14

is the only way that you could avoid the school formally

15

subsidizing that opposing value judgment.
MS. EDWARDS:

16
17

Not to pay for it, not to have an

advisor.

18

QUESTION:

Right.

19

MS. EDWARDS:

And not to allow the other viewpoint to

20

be presented.

To only have one viewpoint, you would have to

21

have no school newspaper, yes.

22

QUESTION:

So I take it on your theory that the

23

school could not even require that the students include in the

24

newspaper the idea that smoking pot is bad.

25

MS. EDWARDS:

Oh, sure.

That is both viewpoints to

11

MS. EDWARDS:

12

all.

No what?
I do not believe that is required at

I do not think that anybody said that they had to have.

13

QUESTION:

14

MS. EDWARDS:

15

NO.

What is required?
That they would have to put in a story.

The point is excluding a viewpoint.
QUESTION:

16

I know.

But the school says to the paper

17

you have put in a story that smoking pot is great, now you have

18

to put in a story along with it that smoking pot is bad.

19

Now could they do that to the newspaper?

20

MS. EDWARDS:

21

QUESTION:

No.

The school is not the editor.

All right.

So the students could

exclusively say only that smoking pot is great, that is your

theory.

I really do not know the answer to that.

think that it has so much to do with other things such as

7

public access and things to the airwaves and things like that,

8

I really do not know.
QUESTION:

9

I mean I

You do not think that you could have a

10

class in which you are teaching students journalism and

11

teaching them how to produce a newspaper and maintain school

12

control over all aspects of that publication including content?
MS. EDWARDS:

13

Not if the content is placed and

14

delegated to the students or jointly with the students'

15

advisor, and not if it is discussion or an expressive vehicle

16

as they admit this paper was for student expression.

17

that when you get student expression involved, then the

school's control cannot be absolute.
QUESTION:

case.

the person who normally exercised responsibility, Mr. Stergos

about it, and had just as weak reasons as the principal did,

Would you still have a case?

6

MS. EDWARDS:

QUESTION:

If he —

If he ended up after all of the

deliberations had gone into whether these articles ought to go

in or not, and he comes to the conclusion that these are not

11

them.

12

Do you have the same right to say?

13

MS. EDWARDS:

Frankly, I think that it is not very

strong, no.

I would say that the advisor has the ability and

the right because of his expertise to do some editorial

function.

MS. EDWARDS:

That they reached up and got someone

standards, this article does not show the degree of maturity

3

that we think that it ought to show to have the school name on

4

it and all of the rest, there is some misspelling in it and

5

some bad grammar, a mixture of reasons, that is not enough?

6

MS. EDWARDS:

7

QUESTION:

8

The advisor, that he could do that?

If the advisor can do it, I do not

understand why the principal cannot.
MS. EDWARDS:

9

Because the advisor is part of what has

10

been delegated by the school to be the training and practicing

11

of student expression.
QUESTION:

12

It seems to me what you are saying is if

13

you are going to have censors that they have to be good

14

censors.

15

MS. EDWARDS:

No, I think that they have to be

16

journalistically involved, so the motivation of the school is

17

good journalism and not a viewpoint.

18

QUESTION:

It is a constitutional line whether you

19

are violating the Constitution depends on whether you have a

20

good journalist involved or not in the censorship?

21

MS. EDWARDS:

The constitutional line comes with

22

whether student expression is protected or not.

23

then I think that the scrutiny has to be very strict.

24

thought that we were talking about a very detailed situation

25

where the actual censorship was done by one person at one level

2

detail is not to me of constitutional limits, but the

3

censorship is.
QUESTION:

4

So that

Well, I would think that you would say

5

that the principal not being acquainted with journalism could

6

not order this piece deleted even it had inflammatory matters

7

in it.

8
9

10
11
12
13
14
15

MS. EDWARDS:

I think that is because of Tinker.

I

do not think that has so much of a policy aspect except of the
school's educational interests.
QUESTION:

Here is this principal who is not the

advisor, and he is telling them to take it out.
MS. EDWARDS:

I think that he could do that.

Now I

am hoping that is not a practical situation.
QUESTION:

But he could not say well, I think this

16

article ought to be taken out because it involves some parents

17

who really ought to have a chance to say their piece before

18

anything is published like that, he could not say that?

19

MS. EDWARDS:

20

QUESTION:

No.

Does not any newspaper have somebody who

21

makes a judgment as to whether what is published in the

22

newspaper will offend the community, I assume that any

23

newspaper does not try to publish stuff that is offensive?

24

MS. EDWARDS:

25

QUESTION:

Sure.

Now who does that when you have a school

newspaper.

Suppose the principal says here is an article that

2

is on premarital sex, it is an interesting article, but this is

3

a very conservative rural community, our people will find this

4

offensive.

If I were running the local newspaper, I would not
*

5

run a piece like this.

6

And if he cannot make it, who makes it in the school then.

7

are telling me that you have school newspapers that cannot

8

exercise any judgment as to what offense be.

9

MS. EDWARDS:

Now what if he makes that judgment.
You

When the government is the publisher, I

10

do not think that we can equate it to one person with the same

11

rights as the private press.

I do not have a very good answer

12

for that difficult question.

I do not think that the students

13

have to be involved in that if it is their expression.

14

QUESTION:

Once again, you leave us with a terrible

15

choice, either no newspapers at all or newspapers that have to

16

be offensive as no private newspapers need be.

17
18
19

MS. EDWARDS:
need to be either.
QUESTION:

Well, why would a student newspaper

I mean I think that -Because nobody can stop them.

Well, all

20

right, you have to get very responsible adolescents who have

21

very good judgment as to what is offensive to the whole

22

community or not and care.

23

MS. EDWARDS:

I think that private newspapers print

24

offensive things all of the time to some portions of the

25

population.

he does.

MS. EDWARDS:

Yes, if it is inflammatory, libel,

obscenity, and disrupting school, and invading rights of

I am puzzled by the fact that the First

MS. EDWARDS:

Well, I think that in attempting to

analogize to the private press which has a reporter, editor,

22

publisher and an owner, that we have gotten a little bit away

23

from the First Amendment application.

Given your different examples, is,it of

any significance in this case that the school had no objection

to the distribution of xerox copies of the material that was

excluded from the newspaper itself, they just did not want to

10

Ms. Edwards, if I recall your response,

11

you said that it would be okay if the school said this is a

published, we are going to have the last word, that would be

14

okay.
Now suppose it did not say that, at the beginning it

15
16

said it is going to be a wide open paper, but then it begins

17

behaving otherwise, and it starts excluding material when the

18

school was exercising its own judgment that the material is not

19

very good.

20

That would violate the First Amendment then, right?

21

MS. EDWARDS:

22

QUESTION:

Yes.

Why should that be, I mean it is sort of a

violation of the First Amendment that depends on breach of

contract or estoppel or what.

Would that be okay, if they changed their mind in the

MS. EDWARDS:

5

Well, I might qualify my answer a

little.

If it were communicated to the students in some manner

that they now knew that this was the new way to operate, then

8

it might be all right.

This was done too informally, so this

violation?

MS. EDWARDS:

17

No.

It is a pretty frail protection, if that

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS - REBUTTAL

20

MR. BAINE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

21

In answer to Justice White's question, in our

22

petition for writ, we have included the decision of the Eighth

23

Circuit.

24

Court noted, the Spectrum was produced by members of the

25

Journalism II class, its staff was essentially restricted to

And on page A-9 it says,

"Although as the District

44

students of the class and the Spectrum was a part of the school

2

adopted curriculum."
We would submit that the curriculum that was adopted

3
4

by the Hazelwood School District was adopted as the

5

Respondent's own witness said "in the best fashion for the

6

teaching of journalism in a secondary level," and that is under

7

the supervision of a classroom teacher as opposed to an

8

extracurricular, that the curriculum was a very well thought

9

out and well set out correlated with textbook and classroom

10

instruction.

11

subject to the supervision of the principal.

14

And therefore, it was a curricular matter and

But the court said that it was something

more, too.
MR. BAINE:

You are correct there.

They added that

15

it was something more because of the diverse number of ideas

18

to say that the District Court's finding that it was a

19

20

or would have said it.

I think that if the Eighth Circuit wanted

Is there not also some other
