ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. BARRETT PRETTYMAN, JR., ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PRETTYMAN:

10

Cause Number 86-473,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on certiorari to the 4th Circuit

11

Court of Appeals and it involves the question of whether

12

citizens can sue for purely past violations as opposed to on­

13

going violations under the Clean Water Act.

14

Congress has set up a rather interesting dual system

15

of regulating effluent discharges into the nation's waterways.

16

The states adopt these plans, which are approved by the

17

Administrator of EPA, the states issue permits, which set forth

18

the effluent limitations and standards under which the permit

19

holders can discharge, and then to demonstrate that he is

20

operating within the ambits of his permit, the discharger is

21

required to constantly test the effluents and to fill out DMRs

22

or discharge monitoring reports which are on public file and

23

which anyone can go see.

24

These DMRs show on their face when the permit holder

25

is operating within the parameters of the permit and they also

show on their face if,

these DMRs on the public record and then give sixty day notice

if they're going to sue for alleged violations and if the suits

are not settled,

in fact,

the discharger is exceeding

Thus, citizens groups like Respondent can review

I really mean that that money, of course, goes to the

They allege in their allegations the permit holder to

10

be in violation. They usually attach these DMRs to their

11

complaints and as I say,

12

to the United States.

13

in theory at least,

the recovery goes

When Gwaltney of Smithfield purchased a meat

14

rendering and packing plant from ITT toward the end of 1981,

15

found after the purchase that it had inherited some problems,

16

principally with the biological treatment system.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. PRETTYMAN:

It had no prior knowledge?
They did have knowledge that ITT had

19

had problems. They thought the problems had been solved. They

20

found after they purchased that the problems had not been

21

solved.

22

These problems involved primarily chlorine,

fecal

23

coliform, and total kjeldahl nitrogen or TKN,

24

experienced various excedences and various parameters of its

25

permits.

However,

it

and it thereafter

undisputed that all of the excedences had, in fact, stopped

2

prior to this suit.

3

stipulated between the parties and the Respondents even

4

conceded in their question presented before this Court that

5

this case involved only past violations.

The Court of Appeals so held. It was so

First, as to chlorine, I'll touch on these just

6

7

briefly, as to chlorine, we have found many problems in

8

installing a new automatic chlorinator, but that finally fell

9

into place in October of '82, so that there were no excedences

10

for some twenty months or almost two years prior to the trial

11

in this matter.

12

With the exception of start-up excedences, which I'll

13

talk about a little bit more later, the same is really true for

14

fecal coliform; that is, that they substantially ended in 1982.
We had more problem with the TKN and had to install

15
16

largely a new system and there were various fits and starts,

17

including a six-month delay by the State Water Control Board

18

itself, but the system was finally approved by the state and it

19

began operation in October of '83 and it was fully on line in

20

December.

21

So that the only TKN excedences between then and --

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. PRETTYMAN:

Is that a coined word or something?
Yes, Your Honor.

It's the

24

alternative to violation because if you use violation, there

25

seems to be some import -5

QUESTION:

2

Is it coined for this industry or

something?

3

MR. PRETTYMAN:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. PRETTYMAN:

6
7

Pardon?

Pardon me?

Was it coined for this statute?
No. It is my understanding it is

regularly used in the industry. It's not just for this case.
What it means is, Your Honor, that you have exceeded

8

the limits in your permit, but an excedence, of course, could

9

be a permissible upset or could be for other permissible

10
11

reasons. Therefore, it's not necessarily a violation.
And as I was saying, the excedences here, as far as

12

TKN is concerned, were the unavoidable start-up excedences

13

before suit. The District Court held that there is no way to

14

start-up a biological treatment system without violations.

15

But the important point here, really, to focus on is

16

that the last fecal coliform excedence was four months before

17

suit, TKN was a full month before suit, and, of course, the

18

chlorine was twenty months ago.

19

the rather pristine question of whether citizens can sue for

20

purely past violations, those which have abated prior to suit.

21

The Court of Appeals held that they can. We say that

22

they can't. The Solicitor General interprets the Act as we do,

23

as to past violations.

24

how he interprets the word "alleged" in the statute and,

25

therefore, with his recommended disposition.

So, the case comes to you with

We disagree with him only in respect as

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Prettyman, did the District Court have

2

an alternative holding below that there were continuing

3

violations?

4

MR. PRETTYMAN:

5

QUESTION:

What it had, Justice O'Connor, was —

I was under the impression that it did,

6

and that that holding was just not reviewed by the Court of

7

Appeals.

8
9

MR. PRETTYMAN:

That alternative holding, which was

in a footnote, was that even if you couldn't sue for past

10

violations, that there was a good faith allegation of on-going

11

violations.

12
13
14

I would emphasize in regard to that, first of all, as
you point out, the —
QUESTION:

So, even if you were right, what, at best,

15

what would happen?

16

that could be considered?

17

It would be vacated and remanded so that

MR. PRETTYMAN:

Well, if you reach that question,

18

because you don't have to reach it, of course, if you reach

19

that question, I would certainly think you would want to remand

20

to the Court of Appeals for its consideration, but you

21

shouldn't have to reach that question at all because in view of

22

the fact that it is quite clear, both from the facts, the

23

holding and the stipulation, that everything had stopped, had

24

abated prior to the suit, it really didn't make any difference

25

whether the allegations were good faith or not.
7

1

QUESTION:

Well, unless the trier of fact thought

2

that there was, indeed, a likelihood of some continuing

3

problem, for example, with the TKN-type discharge.

4

MR. PRETTYMAN:

In that regard, Justice O'Connor, I

5

wonder if I could call your attention to Footnotes, I think

6

they are, 25 and 26 of the District Court's opinion because he

7

very well addressed those particular matters.

8

9

25 and 26, where he, in effect, said some question
has arisen as to whether these problems would continue, but I

10

regard that as entirely too speculative to find. He, in effect,

11

holds in these two footnotes that the problem has entirely

12

ceased and I want to point out to you that the Respondents are

13

not here arguing anything about good faith allegations or that

14

these were on-going violations.

15
16
17
18
19

What they are here arguing is that they can sue for
past violations period.
QUESTION:

They posed the suit because --

Mr. Prettyman, can the EPA Administrator

bring a civil penalty action for purely past violations?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

That is an interesting question, and

20

we really don't know the answer to that yet.

21

said yes, but it's interesting that --

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. PRETTYMAN:

The Government

The language is the same.
No.

With great respect, Your Honor,

24

it is not the same. The language in regard to the Government is

25

in Section 309 or 1319, and the language is quite different.
8

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

It is so different that the Government, when it seeks

1

2

to bring a suit for past penalties, doesn't even rely on this

3

statute.

4
5
6

It relies on the judicial code.
QUESTION:

The Government relies on statutes outside

because of the similarity of the language perhaps.
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Right.

And the reason they do that

7

is the language is really not clear in this statute itself as

8

to whether — it's a very convoluted statute when it comes to

9

the Government's rights, but certainly even if the — the point

10

I want to make is that even if the Government can sue for past

11

violations, it is quite clear that the language and the rights

12

are very different from those that relate to a citizen and the

13

Solicitor General is very strong on that point, that he does

14

not believe for a moment that a citizen has the same rights as,

15

and comes under the same language as, the Government does.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Prettyman, the language governing

17

private civil actions doesn't say has violated, but it doesn't

18

say is violating either.

19

MR. PRETTYMAN:

20

QUESTION:

It says is in violation of.
Yes.

Now, that, it seems to me, means something

21

quite different from is now violating.

If you're caught by

22

radar exceeding the speed limit and a police car pulls along

23

side you after you realized that you've been caught and you've

24

lowered your speed, he doesn't say into your window, you are

25

violating the speed limit, you were violating it five miles
9

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

He will say, you know, you were in violation of the

1

back.

2

speed limit.
MR. PRETTYMAN:

3

That would be very fair, Your Honor,

4

if that's all the further we went, but the fact is that this

5

statute, two things go to that.

6

uses the present tense in at least four other places in this

Now, what if I think that that status means you

10

11

violated it in the past and you haven't done anything that

12

seems likely to eliminate that possibility of violation in the

13

future?

14

means?

What if I considered that to be what in violation of

MR. PRETTYMAN:

15

You may then be engaged in an on­

16

going violation and,

17

able to sue because an on-going violation is a present non-

18

compliance because of a failure to correct an underlying

19

difficulty, and if you have,

20

times, you have done nothing about it, and the suit is brought,

21

that may be an on-going violation, may be perfectly proper to

22

sue .

23

in fact, under our definition,

you may be

in fact, violated for several

That's not what happened here.

In this suit, what

24

happened was there were a series of excedences and we did

25

something about it.

We put in place two new systems which were
10

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

supposed to deal with it. After the systems were in place, we

2

had unavoidable start-up excedences, which could not be

3

avoided, the District Court so held, they were no more normal,

4

the District Court again held, than you would expect in an

5

ordinary case, and it was right at the tail end of this,

6

knowing that the situation had abated, knowing that it had been

7

corrected and had come to a close, that Respondents come in and

8

sue.

9

QUESTION:

Is that knowledge clear?

You said that

10

the last violation, the TKN violation, was, excedence, if you

11

want to put it that way, was one month before suit was filed.

12
13
14

But at the time suit was filed, was it clear that the
new equipment you had put in would do the job?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

I don't think there's any question

15

about that, Your Honor.

16

and the footnotes that I pointed out to you and where he said

17

we were, in fact, in compliance, and also --

18

QUESTION:

As the District Court ultimately held

I didn't ask whether you were; I asked was

19

it clear at the time that the suit was filed that the new

20

equipment was effective to do the job.

21

MR. PRETTYMAN:

I think so, and this is the reason

22

that I say so, Your Honor.

First of all, they knew that the

23

new equipment had been put in. Secondly, they knew that it had

24

been completed. They attended a meeting in March of the State

25

Water Control Board at which this was discussed, and the State
11

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202}

628-4888

1

Water Control Board said, look, we've seen it, it looks to us

2

like you're getting this thing under control. There's no need

3

for any further action.
Then, there were some unavoidable start-up

excedences.

7

these unavoidable start-up excedences.
QUESTION:

10

I keep emphasizing that because you cannot start a

But the fact it's unavoidable doesn't get
I mean, the statute doesn't require

negligence or wilfulness to make it an excedence.
MR. PRETTYMAN:

11

Well, let me say two things to that,

12

Your Honor.

13

excedences had ceased prior to suit, but, secondly, even if

14

they had been going on, it may well be that a start-up

15

excedence could be a past violation that, for example, the

16

state could go after.

17

First of all, even the unavoidable start-up

But by definition, it cannot be an on-going

18

violation.

An on-going violation is something where something

19

is going on because of a problem and you are not fixing it, you

20

are not doing anything about it.

21

we've done everything about it.

23

starting to form on the lagoon which takes a long time. That's

a problem getting that into shape, and those excedences cannot

possibly constitute an on-going violation by their very nature.

This is a situation where
We put in a new system.

We

It is now -- the crust is

12

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1
2

They are the tail-end of abatement.
The whole purpose of the statute is abatement. The

3

statute, you've got to remember, follows directly upon the

4

Clean Air Act, and the Clean Air Act, as you will recall, had

5

only an injunctive provision in it, and it related only to

6

compliance, only to on-going, only to abatement.

7

The one thing that this statute added to the Clean

8

Air Act was the remedy of penalty, and that, by adding the

9

penalty, what, it seems to me, Congress clearly did was to say

10

we're going to add an extra incentive for you to stop sooner

11

because by saying that you're going to get penalties and not

12

just an injunction, it becomes very much to your advantage to

13

stop at the earliest possible moment during the sixty-day

14

period, for example.

15

You get your sixty-day notice.

If you can abate in

16

there and stop, you have avoided your penalties and that's what

17

the Act is entirely about.

18

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Prettyman, what's the test for

19

violation and to get into court in this citizens suit?

20

don't really take the position, as I read your brief, that

21

there has to be a violation on the day the suit is filed.

22

MR. PRETTYMAN:

Correct.

You

I'm not sure I can define

23

it any better than I did a little while ago, and that is

24

present non-compliance for failure to correct the situation.

25

Our definition would be that if there -- the 5th Circuit
13
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

pointed this out in Sierra Club v. Shell_Oil that you can't

2

just take an excedence here, an excedence there, and kind of

3

bunch them all together and say this is an on-going violation.
What you do is you kind of look behind them and you

4
5

see is there a reason for this, is it on-going, do you have

6

here somebody who has just turned off the spigot in order to

7

avoid a suit, is it a periodic episodic violator who is just

8

trying to avoid suit.
In other words, the District Court can look at the

9
10

facts very much as he does in a regular injunction proceeding

11

to determine whether there is a problem which is creating

12

excedences which you have not corrected, you have not done

13

anything about.

15

If you have not, then it is an on-going

QUESTION:

And if there's any question about the

16

efficacy of the so-called correction, is that something that

17

would entitle the citizen to sue and litigate about?

18

MR. PRETTYMAN:

Might well.

Now, for example, let's

19

suppose you have taken some action, but it's the improper

20

action, it's ineffective action, it's not enough action,

21

won't work, that's something that the court would be entitled

22

to look to to see whether, in fact, there is an on-going

23

problem that you have not properly addressed.

That's —

But they didn't.
Well, I wouldn't say that there's no

did it and what manner, but this suit is not about, and even

Respondents do not say it is about, whether the penalties were

didn't move quickly enough.

was satisfied with the compliance, he would not issue an

For the period up until the time that

If there was jurisdiction at the time

MR. PRETTYMAN:

Because, Your Honor, at the time the

suit was filed, there was jurisdiction and the reason that

22

there was jurisdiction was that this statute required an on­

23

going violation at the time suit was filed and in your

hypothetical, there was an on-going violation.

are very close on our interpretation of that, and perhaps I

4

ought to turn then to one difference between us and the

5

Government before I come back to other matters.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Prettyman, I take it your answer to

7

one of Justice White's questions, however, is, or is it, that

8

under those circumstances, the District Court should dismiss

9

the complaint?

10

MR. PRETTYMAN:

11

QUESTION:

12
13

No.

Jurisdiction and then there was

compliance, what happens to the lawsuit?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

No. What I would say under those

14

circumstances is that he should not issue an injunction if he's

15

satisfied that there is true compliance and abatement, but that

16

he may well decide to issue penalties because he had

17

jurisdiction at the time that the suit was brought.

18

Now, I want to say just one thing before I get to

19

this business of allegations.

20

that, really, this statute makes no sense if you're going to

21

treat it as going to past violations.

22

I just want to point out to you

Let me just give you two brief examples.

The citizen

23

would be giving notice of something that's already abated.

24

the courts that have looked at this agree that one of the

25

purposes of giving sixty-day notice to the permit holder is to

All

1

allow him to get himself into shape and to abate, to get rid of
the problem.

3

Here you have a situation where somebody is s\iing for

4

penalties five years old, maybe fifteen years old, because we

5

don't know what the statute of limitations is.

6

in the statute.

There isnone

So, you're suing for fifteen years old and you're

giving the man sixty days notice for what?

9

sense. The only thing that makes sense is that you're giving

10

him sixty days notice of an on-going violation.
One other example.

11
12

It doesn't make any

The citizen couldn't sue for past

violations when the Administrator is already suing for on-going

i^\

violations.

I realize this is a little difficult, but if you
✓

14

will look at the language in 1365, you will see that what it

15

says is that when the Administrator is actively prosecuting a

16

suit for compliance, the citizen can't come in and sue.

17

§

•

Now, the only way that makes any sense at all is if

18

they're both trying to sue for the same thing; that is, the

19

citizen is trying to sue for an on-going violation, and the

20

Government is suing for an on-going violation.

21

If you have the citizen stopped from suing for past

22

violations because the Government is suing for present or the

23

Government is not suing for present and they are both suing at

24

the time, same time, for past, it doesn't — the statute

25

doesn't hang together. It makes no sense.
19
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

But 1st ms move then to the one’ point of difference

1

2

between us and the Solicitor General, and that is this business

3

of the allegation. He puts a great deal of stress on the word

4

"alleged", and he feels that a good faith allegation of on­

5

going violation gets the citizens past the jurisdictional

6

requirements of an on-going violation.

7

Now,

I want to emphasize, as we've already pointed

8

out,

that the Court of Appeals never passed on this, and that

9

even the District Court said that the good faith allegation

10

related only to TKN and, Justice O'Connor, TKN was the smaller

11

part, as you know,

12

chlorination, which stopped twenty months before.

13

of the award.

But even as to TKN,

A million dollars was for

that's very confusing because the

14

Government concedes that once you make an allegation and we

15

contest it under 12(b)(1),

16

we're saying is here, you can allege all you want to that

17

something is on-going, but if,

19

the Court can go behind it, and all

in fact, we challenge you, you

This is true in any kind of a suit.

It's true in a

20

suit where I file a suit against you on diversity grounds in

21

Pennsylvania and I attach all of your prior reports to show you

22

were there and you file a motion dismissing saying I'm sorry I

23

moved into your state of Maryland since my last report.

24
25

QUESTION:

Isn't the Government's position that it

should apply something like Rule 11 of good faith belief?
20

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

MR. PRETTYMAN:

1

Yes, but look what that does, Your

2

Honor.

Someone who files a group of DMRs just as someone who

3

files your last ten quarterly reports would, in good faith,

4

believe that we are in the midst of an on-going violation or

5

that you are located in Pennsylvania.

6

and,

7

and if, in fact, our violations have come to a halt prior to

8

suit, they have been abated, they have been cleaned up and

9

stopped, which is the purpose of the Act, then all we're saying

But if that is attacked

in fact, you have moved from Pennsylvania into Maryland

10

is that you can't go ahead with a suit where a mere allegation

11

gets you to trial.

12
13

If the allegation is wrong, it doesn't make any
difference what your good faith is, it is wrong.
I see I don't have much time left, and if I could,

14
15

I'd like to save just a few moments for rebuttal.

16

Thank you.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

22

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Very well, Mr. Prettyman.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

23

It may be useful to begin by indicating the degree to

24

which both the District Court and the Court of Appeals did deal

25

with the question of whether there was a risk of repetition of
21

Heritage

1

the violations which it had noticed for the past.
I simply want to draw the Court's attention to two

page 38(a).

on page 38(a)?
The problem of

determining whether a violation is continuing is highlighted.
Well,

in this case, skipping a bit, with the history

Now, the Court of Appeals, and here I refer the Court

1

2

to page 7(a) of the Appendix and Footnote 9, looking at the

3

second paragraph of that footnote, and the second sentence of

4

that paragraph, the Court of Appeals says "a very sound

5

argument can be made that Plaintiff's allegation of continuing

6

violations were made in good faith despite the fact that

7

Gwaltney had not actually violated the Act since May 15th,

8

1984."

9

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Claiborne, what about the

10

Footnotes 25 and 26 that Mr. Prettyman referred to in the

11

District Court Opinion, which basically say the District Court

12

believes that to conclude there were continuing violations

13

would be too speculative on the present record?

14

MR. CLAIBORNE:

I think those, Justice O'Connor,

15

those two statements can be reconciled. What the Court is

16

saying is that at the time of filing and at the time of trial,

17

there was ground to fear that there would be repetition of the

18

excedences, so called; that is to say, violations in winter

19

time.

20

By the time this opinion is written in June of 1985,

21

the Court, having experienced a winter without violations, is

22

now saying we don't have ground to fear for the future any

23

longer.

24
25

They are different times we are talking about.

You don't think, the District Court Opinion

MR.

CLAIBORNE:

2

QUESTION:

I do, Your Honor.

And that these footnotes indicate that the

3

Court found that too speculative to find an on-going violation

4

at that time?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

5

That is exactly — Justice O'Connor,

6

I may have mis-spoken. What I meant to indicate was that the

7

Court found that in June of 1984, when the complaint was filed,

8

and in December of 1984, when the trial was held,

9

still ground to fear that the system,

10

handle the problem during the winter.

11

there was

When this opinion is written and that is what the

12

ultimate footnotes are addressing now,

13

it would be speculative to suppose that -- the winter having

gone by without incident,

15

that there would be problems for the future.

That would be the normal -- wouldn't that

be the normal assumption?

4

MR. CLAIBORNE:

5

QUESTION:

6

Well, Your Honor, —

That he'd be writing his opinion based on

the record that was made.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

7

-- the footnote to which I have

8

referred, Footnote 8, very clearly indicates that not only in

9

the Court's view, but in view of the expert for the Defendant

10

there was ground to fear that the problem had not been solved

11

as of the date of trial in December 1984.
QUESTION:

12

Well, why shouldn't the rule be for this

13

jurisdictional argument or the citizen bringing suit, at the

14

time of filing the suit, which in a lot of courts will be an

15

awful long time before the trial, --

16

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Your Honor,

this is only a preamble

17

to say, as Your Honor has indicated,

there is perhaps a little

18

logic in focusing on the state of mind of the Plaintiff and the

19

grounds for objective belief at the time of filing as opposed

20

to the time of judgment, and, yet, my learned friend,

21

indicate that he would condone the assessment of penalties

22

entirely for the past provided that at the time of filing there

23

were an on-going violation, even though it had been

24

demonstrated that the problem was cured before judgment was

25

entered.
25

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

seem to

Now,

1

that,

to us,

highlights the reason why it is not

2

sensible to focus on the notion of on-going violation at all,

3

whether at the time the suit is filed or at the time when

4

judgment is entered, and it is for that reason that we cannot

5

embrace either the 1st Circuit's decision or the Government's

6

brief here, albeit they might resolve this case favorably to

7

us, .because it seems to us that the logic must be that if

8

matters whether there's an on-going violation,

9

that matters is when penalties are being assessed,

10

it

the time when
not when the

suit is being filed.
QUESTION:

11

So, you want us to take the case as it

12

comes to us and decide whether the Court of Appeals is right or

13

wrong?

14

MR.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR.

17

QUESTION:

CLAIBORNE:

Indeed.

On its theory?

CLAIBORNE:

On its theory.

On your construction of the statute, what

18

do you make of the purpose of the sixty-day notice provision,

19

which your opponent says doesn't make sense unless it's given

20

opportunity to abate?

21

MR.

CLAIBORNE:

I'm grateful to the Chief Justice for

22

having focused my attention on that question.

23

history as to the reason why that sixty-day provision was

24

inserted never mentions one reason being to afford the violator

25

an opportunity to get off the hook.

Legislative

That is no where suggested

26

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

in the legislative history as a reason for the notice.
The reason for the notice is to allow the Government.,

2
3

indeed, both Governments, federal and state governments, to

4

take this opportunity to decide whether they wish to enforce

5

the Act and thereby preempt the citizen's suit, and that is —
QUESTION:

6

But the notice doesn't just go to the

7

Government; it's notice both to the Government and to the

8

violator. What's the reason for the notice to the violator?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

9

I suppose, Justice Scalia, that there

10

are two reasons for the notice going to the violator.

The

11

first is that when a violator or an alleged violator is being

12

reported to the authorities as such, as violating the Act, it

13

seems only fair to give him notice of that, not so that he can

14

get off the hook for the past violations, but perhaps so that

15

he will more quickly come into compliance and afford himself an

16

opportunity to t - liable for fewer penalties for a shorter

17

time.
It does have that effect of goading the violator into

18
19

ceasing more quickly, not in order to be totally absolved for

20

the past, but to shorten the period for which he will owe

21

penalties.

22

If, indeed, penalties are appropriate and we do not

23

maintain that penalties are always appropriate no matter how

24

isolated the violation, no matter how old it may be, no matter

25

how quickly it was corrected, those are matters which the
27

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

District Court in its discretion may determine at the penalty

2

phase it had no bearing on the jurisdiction of the Court to

3

entertain the case --

4

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Claiborne, —

5

MR. CLAIBORNE:

6

QUESTION:

— and ever bearing on the --

-- I'm troubled by suppose we have a

7

situation of two or three isolated violations, five years

8

before the suit is filed, and the citizen files the suit

9

seeking only civil penalties for those prior violations.

10
11

12
13

Now, you want us to hold that that kind of a suit is
perfectly permitted and that the Court has jurisdiction, right?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

may be a question about whether five years is beyond --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. CLAIBORNE:

16
17
18
19

I would say, Justice O'Connor, there

Well, there's no statute of limitations.
Well, that's not entirely clear.

There is a suggestion that the statute -QUESTION: . Well, let's not go off on that.

Let's

assume there is none.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

It so happens the statute of

20

limitations would be applicable as a five-year one which is the

21

only reason I mentioned it.

22

and otherwise the matters are as Your Honor suggested, that is

23

a case in which we would say there is jurisdiction in the

24

District Court to entertain the citizen complaint.

25

QUESTION:

But let's say it's four years ago

Well, now, the penalties go only to the
28

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

Government, is that right?

2

MR. CLAIBORNE:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Well, let me say, first, that the

question of standing had not been taken to this Court.
QUESTION:

7

8

And how does the citizen have standing in

a constitutional sense to come in and get those?

5
6

That is so.

Well, I know, but doesn't that form an

interpretation of the statute?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

9

Well, it may be that because the

10

standing in strict sense is jurisdictional, it's before this

11

Court in any event, and I'm not trying to avoid the question;

12

I'm just giving a preparatory explanation.
In our view, standing in the citizen complainant, and

13
14

he must be under the statute not any citizen but one who is

15

aggrieved by the pollution which occurs, that means, and as is

16

true in this case, that a member or more members of the

17

organization must live on or near the affected water and be

18

injured by its pollution, either in his commercial or

19

recreational activities there. That shows that he has injury in

20

fact.

21

Now, it is perfectly true that the assessment of

22

penalties will not immediately and directly redress that

23

injury, but it will have a substantially beneficial effect on

24

his interest in that river in the following three ways: first,

25

the threat of the imposition of such penalties is likely as the
29

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

A

1

EPA policy on penalties is at pains to indicate to deter him

2

from violating in the first place.
But even after he has violated, if he has been

3
4

assessed substantial penalties, it is an assurance that he will

5

not return to his old ways.

6

injunction would not have been necessary, the assessment of

7

penalties against him does obviously deter him from doing it

8

again.

9

MR. CLAIBORNE:

11

QUESTION:

13

But, thirdly, —

— that really is stretching any

traditional notice of standing.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Your Honor, I think not.

It has a

14

very particular effect on the particular river and the

15

particular injury that this individual Plaintiff is concerned

16

about, and the third way in which it relieves his concern is

17

that it deters not merely that same violator but others on the

18

same river or river system who would otherwise feel free to

19

pollute the river until enjoined.

20

^

Well, it seems to me —

10

12

5

QUESTION:

Even in circumstances where

QUESTION:

On that analysis, you would say that

21

Congress would have the power to confer standing upon any

22

citizen to prosecute violations of crimes within his community,

23

right? Congress could pass a law saying the United States

24

Attorney shall no longer be the sole person who can prosecute

25

crimes, but any person in the community in which a crime
30
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

occurred may bring a prosecution?

2

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Justice Scalia, there are, I assume,

3

independent reasons not related to standing why an individual

4

ought not be permitted to prosecute criminally.

5

answer on standing, I suppose the answer must be yes, that

6

prosecuting for crimes and prosecuting for penalties would

7

serve the interest and protect the values in that river to the

8

same degree, but —

9

QUESTION:

So far as the

But I thought your answer to Justice

10

O'Connor's question was that you had to be affected by the

11

particular pollution in question before you could sue as a

12

citizen and, therefore, it seems to me your answer to Justice

13

Scalia ought to be the logical counterpart woiild be to allow

14

victims to bring a prosecution for crime but not just anyone in

15

the community.

16

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Well, I suppose that Justi a Scalia

17

was really asking me, and I shouldn't be making such

18

assumptions, whether this same citizen who lives on or near the

19

river would have equal standing to bring a criminal prosecution

20

as he does in my submission to bring an action for civil

21

penalties, and put that way, my answer is yes, he's got equal

22

standing, but the privilege of prosecution is one that, for

23

other constitutional reasons, not standing, are not available

24

to the ordinary citizen.

25

QUESTION:

You never got to your third reason,
31

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

the

1

third way that a citizen -- that this person is affected.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

2
3

deterring others —

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Justice White, the third way is in

I see.
— on the same river who would

6

otherwise feel sanguine about polluting the river, and I must

7

say that we are talking here about the imposition of civil

8

penalties, not a marginal peripheral unimportant sanction.
It is, as the EPA policy has made clear, probably the

9
10

most important sanction in government enforcement.

One would

11

suppose that when the citizen is given the privilege of

12

standing in for the Government, provided he has standing or

13

personal interest in the matter, he ought to have as much as

14

possible the same weapons.
Now, he cannot issue administrative orders.

15

He

16

cannot institute criminal prosecutions, but when it comes to

17

civil actions, one would expect him to be able to obtain»like

18

relief and this relief, the imposition of penalties, is the

19

most important instrument because, otherwise, a polluter has

20

every incentive to delay compliance and to profit by his

21

advantage over complying competitors and to delay the

22

expenditures.
QUESTION:

23
24

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Your Honor. Congress was well aware that there might be a

tendency to abuse the citizens supervision, so it provided and

the legislative history notes it that attorneys' fees are

if he files frivolous, vexatious or harassing litigation, and

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Well, it isn't —

Not really on behalf of, but —
It would be extraordinary if the
33

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

solution to the standing problem were to have a Treetom action,

2

which the Court has more than once indicated presents no

3

constitutional problem, which Congress only last year

4

reaffirmed and widened with respect to the False Claims Act,

5

thereby if we had a Treetom action in which the informer had a

6

pecuniary interest because he got a share of the assessment

7

and, yet, he would widen the class of potential plaintiffs to

8

include any citizen, as is true under the False Claims Act, now

9

that simply cannot be a way one solves a constitutional

10

standing problem and, yet, it would seem to be, if this Court

11

were to hold that there is such a problem, a simple remedy for

12

Congress at the next session.
Now, I want to — I am making a very disconnected

13
14

argument, but I want to stress that Congress did not use

15

It seems to us that the Court ought to prefer to tax

clearly but perhaps, even somewhat illiterate sentences here

is downright nonsense.

there can be no question. The statute says so.

It is downright nonsense to say there

cases, because they must be rare, in which despite having been

notified sixty days before, the polluter is so perverse and so

improvident as to continue his evil ways until the day of

filing or perhaps the day of judgment, maybe that's the

6

Government's position, I'm not sure, because otherwise he is

7

excused from all penalties and the Court has no power to impose

8

them.

9

And then to say oh, but, that means only in those rare

One thing or the

other. It is conceivable to

10

hesitate to give the power to assess penalties going to the

11

Treasury for private payment. One can understand that, but once

12

you do give a plaintiff that power, you don't take it all back

13

from him and make it available only in that rare case that .it

14

will almost never occur; that is the case where the polluter is

15

so perverse and so improvident as to continue his violation

16

long enough to give the Court jurisdiction to enter these

17

awards.

18

That simply cannot have been the intent of Congress.
The — it was mentioned that Section 505(1)(b), this

19

is reproduced in Petitioner's brief at page 3, refers to an

20

action to require compliance and that is an action to require

21

compliance by a citizen which would be barred if the Government

22

had previously filed.

23

And the suggestion is that an action for penalties is

24

not an action to require compliance; therefore, Congress is

25

telling us here that it never intended to authorize an action

for penalties.

loss, but the other thing to be noticed about this provision is

3

that it doesn't use language quite so fastidiously.

4

Now, we know it did.

So, we're a bit at a

The words are that the Federal or State Governments,

5

the citizens suits will not lie if the Federal or State

6

Governments has commenced and is diligently prosecuting a civil

7

or criminal action in a court of the United States to require

8

compliance with the standard of limitations and so forth..

9

Let me say a criminal action is not, strictly

10

speaking, an action to require compliance any more than an

11

action to collect penalties.

12

that Congress was not punctilious in its use of language, not

13

that it meant that there was no action by the citizen to secure

14

an assessment of penalties.

15

What is proved here is simply

Indeed, the Congress, in 3985-86 and '87, made quite

16

clear that it understood itself sore years earlier to have

17

authorized citizens suits in respect of wholly past violations

18

and to the assessment of penalties without an injunction in

19

those circumstances.

20

I draw the --

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Claiborne, that section may bring the

22

realization of the question I asked you because it permits the

23

citizen to intervene as a matter of right in the criminal

24

action apparently.

25

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Again, Justice Scalia, I wonder
36

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

whether they really meant it.

2

We do not claim that right.

3

I think that is rather a lapse.

The Section 309(d) was added in 1987.

It had been

4

prepared in 1985 and 1986, the provision, for quite independent

5

reasons, was vetoed by the President, and, so, was not enacted

6

in its final form until 1987.

7

Its purpose, so far as we're concerned, was to add to
e

8

the Clean Water Act an ability for the Administrator to assess

9

penalties administratively.

He had already issued cease and

10

desist orders administratively, but he could not assess

11

penalties in this way.

12

Having given the Administrator that authority and we

13

are clear on both sides that this authority relates solely to

14

past events, solely to past violations, which attract the civil

15

penalties, Congress went on to say that a citizens suit would

16

lie in respect of the same violations only if notified or filed

17

before the Administrator acted.

18

Now, according to the Petitioner, that was

19

unnecessary to say because there could be no citizen suit

20

notified or filed in respect to purely past violations.

21

is Congress indicating that it understood otherwise.

22

Here

I may say that the Petitioner himself obviously

23

understood otherwise during the eleven months before the filing

24

of the motion to dismiss on this ground and when it took the

25

trouble to seek amendment of the summary judgment that had been

entered in August 1984, to absolve itself in respect of the

2

violations that had occurred before it acquired the property,

3

what was the point of that, except that it feared that

4

penalties would be assessed in respect of those old violations.

5

It was only eleven months later that, and only when

6

the 5th Circuit handed down its Hamford decision that anybody

7

for the first time focused on the present tense in 505 and

8

said, oh, this qualifies, the entire statute, we had it wrong,

9

no penalties can be assessed in a citizen suit, except only,

10

when for reasons not easy to understand, when they are, in

11

effect, combined with an injunction.

12

need penalties because the injunction serves the purpose and

13

its violation will, of course, attract civil and criminal

14

contempt penalties of its own.

MR. PRETTYMAN:

21

23

Thank you, Mr. Claiborne.

Just a few very quick points, Your

Honor.
I would urge that you read the end of Footnote 9,

24

which my good friend for the Respondents did not get to, and

25

call your attention to the first part of it.

We filed a motion to dismiss almost a year after the

2

last violation, which clearly alerted the District Court Judge

3

that there had been no violations during the course of that

4

year when he ruled he was fully familiar with that.

5

I have to go outside of the record to make the

6

following statement, and that is that there have been none for

7

now four years, and I say that with equanimity because I am

8

sure my Respondents won't dispute it.

There was one hurricane

The problem with the Article 3 is that I think it may

11

be directed in your questions, Justice Scalia, to perhaps the

12

wrong point.

13

redressability; that is, when all of the penalties go to the

14

Government and you don't have an injunction going to the

15

underlying fact, you have an injury that is not redressed by

16

any remedy and that closes the Article 3.

17

The real problem with Article 3 is

And I would urge the Court to be very careful here if

18

it's going to open the flood gates to these past suits because

19

you know you're not only going to have these federal suits for

20

going back we don't know how many years, maybe fifteen, but

21

we're going to have many state claims, you're going to be

22

trying state claims in federal courts going back fifteen years,

23

which is going to be attached to those federal claims, which is

24

going to cause great hazard to the federal courts.

25

Thank you very much.
