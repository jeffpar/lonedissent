CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Mathews, you may

ORAL ARGUMENT BY ERNEST L. MATHEWS, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. MATHEWS:

7
8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case is the extent to which the

9
10

Employees Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, ERISA,

11

preempts state garnishment laws.
The Petitioner is a longshoreman's vacation and

12

13

holiday fund which is an employee benefit fund, a welfare fund

14

governed by ERISA.

15

The case arose when a collection agency in Georgia,

16

the Respondent Lanier Collection Agency, attempted to garnish

17

the vacation and holiday benefits of 23 longshoremen.

18

brought a proceeding in the County Court of Chatham County,

19

Georgia.

20

They

In the decision under review, the Supreme Court of

21

Georgia held that while the state garnishment procedures were

22

not preempted as applied to ERISA welfare funds, the exception

23

in the Georgia statute, which removed from the effects of

24

garnishment welfare funds, was preempted as being contrary to

25

the provisions of ERISA.

3

(202) 628-4888

1

The real issue in this case, it seems to me, is

2

whether Congress means what it says, because we are dealing

3

here with an expressed preempt section, Section 514 of ERISA,

4

which says that any state law that relates to an employee

5

benefit plan is preempted, so there is no need to psycho­

6

analyze Congress or to go into legislative history.

7

right there plain and simple in the statute.

8

"relate to" have been construed by this Court in a unanimous

9

decision which has been relied on in five different cases with

It is

And the words

10

no change from the definition that relate to as the ordinary,

11

common sense dictionary meaning.

12

something, if it has an effect on it, it has reference to it,

13

it has a connection with it.

14

If something relates to

So really the only question in this case is whether

15

or not when you have an attempt to garnish these funds, does

16

the state garnishment law have an effect upon the funds.

17

QUESTION:

How about state laws against embezzlement?

18

I mean it just can't possibly mean anything that has an effect

19

upon the fund.

20

apply to embezzlement from the funds?

21

You mean state laws against embezzlement do not

MR. MATHEWS:

Well, Congress anticipated your

22

question, Justice Scalia, because ERISA expressly removes from

23

its preemption section state laws of general — criminal laws

24

of general application.

25

So embezzlement is a --

QUESTION:

Civil laws of general application.

2

MR. MATHEWS:

3

QUESTION:

4

Criminal laws.

What about civil laws of general

application?

5

MR. MATHEWS:

6

QUESTION:

7

embezzlement under state law?

8
9

Congress does not remove that.

So there could be no civil action for

MR. MATHEWS:

No, there could not.

And I think

that's similar to a case that this Court had where the

10

beneficiaries of the fund tried to bring a common law action

11

against the trustees, and this Court held, no, they were

12

limited to the remedies provided in ERISA.

13

I think there would be a remedy in ERISA if there

14

were embezzlement by the trustees, but it wouldn't be a state

15

common law embezzlement action.

16

QUESTION:

An automobile accident caused by a car

17

driven by an employee of the trust, on the business of the

18

trust, you say there could be no recovery because that would

19

relate to ERISA.

You would say that.

MR. MATHEWS:

MR. MATHEWS:

I don't think I have to.
All right.
I'm not sure.

QUESTION:

2

MR. MATHEWS:

intended that these ERISA plans function.

4

going to function in the real world, they are going to have to

5

hire employees, they are going to have to rent premises, you

6

know, rent a xerox machine, what have you.

7

to work for them if they can't sue them for their wages, and no

8

one is going to rent property or rent space to them if they

9

can't evict them if they don't pay.

And if they are

And nobody is going

So I think Congress must have intended that the

11

ordinary liabilities that someone has entering into any

12

business would apply to the ERISA fund.
QUESTION:

13

So we are just arguing about whether being

14

liable for garnishment is one of the ordinary things that any

15

employer normally engages in.
MR. MATHEWS:

16

And if this case were a garnishment

17

about a fund employee, I might even agree that that is not

18

preempted.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. MATHEWS:

I see.
But this is a garnishment of the

21

beneficiaries of the fund.

22

well, it really doesn't have any paid employees.

23

did, it would have two or three.

Well, I think that Congress obviously

QUESTION:

All I am

pointing out is you really just can't say it's simple language

if it relates to.

5

things will relate to the fund in the sense of having an effect

6

upon the fund, which you will acknowledge are okay.

You really don't mean that.

MR. MATHEWS:

Yes.

I mean a lot of

laughing.

You can have fun but you can't die

That's the doctrine that applies.
MR. MATHEWS:

No, the federal laws should not be

13

impaired in their work.

14

Airlines case, that they are sort of revived when they are

15

necessary to accomplish the ends of a federal statute.

16

And the doctrine in Shaw v. Delta

One of the ends of ERISA is to have plans work, and

17

so I would say it's a revival, but that 514 still would,

18

without that concept of revival, would preempt them.

19
20

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Mathews, there is a sue and be

sued clause in ERISA, isn't there?

21

MR. MATHEWS:

22

QUESTION:

Yes, there is.

And this Court has said, based on other

23

sue and be sued clauses in other circumstances, that that would

24

include garnishment proceedings, hasn't it?

25

MR. MATHEWS:

I believe it has.

7
Heritage Reporting Corporation

QUESTION:

So it certainly is conceivable that

2

Congress intended that garnishment procedures be included

3

within the scope of that sue and be sued provision as being all

4

right.
MR. MATHEWS:

5

If we were looking for an implied

intent of Congress,

But

It said all state laws

We don't have to delve for Congress's intent and

functioning, or is expressly allowed.

11

Congress said if it relates to, and certainly —

12

QUESTION:

Well, of course, Congress did enact

13

Section 206(d) dealing expressly with assignment or alienation

14

of benefits for pension plans.
MR. MATHEWS:

15

That is true, but 206(d)

in its

16

specific terms deals with the voluntary alienation of pension

17

funds.

18

QUESTION:

Well, it deals across the board.

19

MR. MATHEWS:

Well, there has been a gloss on the

20

statute by the courts that that would also cover involuntary

21

alienation.

22

plans.

23

That is true.

QUESTION:

Well,

But 206 says nothing about welfare

in your view,

206(d)

is at least

24

partially superfluous since you think 514 would preempt anyway.

25

So why did Congress need to pass 206(d)?

8
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

MR. MATHEWS:

Well, historically speaking, they

2

passed 206(d) before they passed 514.

3

was drafted there was a much less pervasive preemption

4

provision in the House and Senate drafts of ERISA than in the

5

conference that come up with the 514 which got to the relation

At the time that 206(d)

There are a lot of procedures connected with it, and

18

that's part of the problem that the fund faces is that you have

got funds that have four different states involved, and they

all have different procedures.

21

noxious procedure in that you have got to appear like a

defendant, appear by attorney, file an answer, update it every

to meet state procedures.

14

MR. MATHEWS:

But I don't find a

Well, again, Your Honor, you are going

15

to an implied preemption analysis in trying to psycho analyze

16

Congress.

17

They said does it relate it, and I think that in the real world

18

you cannot say it does not relate to when it makes the trustees

19

pay out the benefits differently than the trust funds says,

20

when it puts them to administrative burdens of appearing in

21

court, when it puts them to a large expense, because in every

22

one of these things they have got to hire a lawyer.

23

I am not just saying let's do what Congress said.

And I figure in the course of filing the updates and

24

everything, that lawyer has to put in an hour's time in the

25

course of a year.

So you are figuring about $100 per

Heritage Reporting Corporation

garnishment.

We have over 109 garnishments in one year alone.

2

That's money out of the fund.
And Congress itself has recognized in another

3

connection, the Consumer Protection Act, that state garnishment

5

laws do have an impact.

6

$1,000 fine and a year in jail for an employer to fire somebody

because his salary has been garnished.

8

Why do they do it?

They have made it a crime with a

they would rather fire somebody than pay the garnishment.

laws, the discrepancies and differences in them have made the

purposes in ERISA.

Well, why is that different?
Because that is necessary to the

functioning of the fund or of anybody else who goes into

11

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

business, and I think it's impliedly revived by Congress's

2

intention that there be funds.
QUESTION:

4

But your language is still the same, and

the garnishment -- you rely entirely on 514, don't you?

I think 514 says what it says.

it says.

Yes, Your Honor, entirely.
It's very clear what

This Court has said what it means.
Does it have an effect on the plan?

It does have an

What they seek to garnish in this case,

In Georgia,

all their vacation for the previous year if they have qualified

20

for vacation and holiday benefits.

21

So like December 31st they get all their holidays and

That's what I say about the 45-day renewal.

If they

22

get served with a garnishment in January, every 45 days they

23

have got to go up and say, we don't owe them anything yet until

24

we get to December 31st.

25

and now we owe it to them, and here's the money.

And then they come in and they say,

12
Heritage Reporting Corporation

So it's an

1

ongoing thing which plan has to refer to our office, and an

2

attorney has to work on them.

AS AMICUS CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS

3

MR. MARTIN:

4
5

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We agree with Petitioner that ERISA, in general,

preempts the application of state garnishment laws to employee

benefit plans.

8

get to the 514 point, I'd like to respond to a couple of points

9

of Justice O'Connor.

10

Our view is also based on 514.

But before I

The sue and be sued clause in Section 502 seems to us

11

to mean that a plan may be sued on any valid federal claim or

12

13

provision of 514, whatever that means.

14

It does not override the preemptive

And with respect to 206(d)(1), which provides that

15

pension benefits may not be assigned or alienated, we do think

16

there is a bit of overlap between 206 and 514.

17

that to conclude it, this overlap makes much more sense in a

18

complex ERISA statute that was built over the course of years

19

than to conclude that 206, by addressing pension benefits and

20

not welfare benefits, silently excluded garnishment of welfare

21

benefits from 514. Exclusions from 514 are in 514, 514(b) in

22

particular.

23

But we think

Justice Scalia raises the obvious question, where

24

does the line draw in 514.

We think that there are a number of

25

ways to answer that question.

14
Heritage Reporting Corporation

One rule of decision would be a state law that

ORAL ARGUMENT BY MAUREEN E. MAHONEY, ESQ.

9

AS AMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF JUDGMENT BELOW
MS. MAHONEY:

10
11
12

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Solicitor General and the Petitioners are

13

searching for a line on how to interpret Section 514's relate

14

to language.

15

in all of the other cases, with the exception of Franchise Tax

16

Board in which this Court has considered the preemptive scope

17

of Section 514, it was dealing with actions which were brought

18

by trustees or beneficiaries.

19

There is no question it's a difficult task.

But

Trustees and beneficiaries are provided specific

20

remedies under Section 502 of the Act.

21

that when you are dealing with claims by beneficiaries and by

22

trustees within the core of the Act, that all state law, all

23

state substantive law and even the causes of action are

24

preempted because those are within the core of ERISA.

25

And the Court has found

The only case where this Court has considered the

19
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

m

1

scope of preemption in an action brought by a party not covered

2

by Section 502, such as a creditor of the fund or as in this

3

case, a creditor who seeks garnishment against a beneficiary,

4

was Franchise Tax Board.

5

And in that case this Court specifically drew the

6

line by saying that ERISA was not intended to preempt all

7

causes of action by third parties against a fund.

8

speak to the question of what a third party's remedies against

9

the fund may be.

10

It doesn't

Instead, it says that the causes of action themselves

11

are preserved, but the substantive law that will be applied to

12

the right to recover has to be consistent with federal law

13

under ERISA.

14

So, in effect, in Franchise Tax Board, the Court drew

15

a line and said the action to enforce the tax levy, which was

16

brought by the state, was not in and of itself preempted, but

17

the question of whether or not the trustee could comply with

18

that remedy had to be answered under federal substantive law.

19

So, in effect, this Court has said that while a

20

conflicts analysis for preemption isn't required in a case

21

which is brought by an beneficiary or by a trustee within the

22

realm of rights covered under Section 502, it is required when

23

it is an action which is brought by a third party against a

24

fund for remedies which are collateral to the substantive

25

purposes of ERISA.

QUESTION:

#

decision to which you refer, was that decision of our Court or

of the Ninth Circuit?
MS. MAHONEY:

4
5

That was a decision of your Court, Your

Honor.

6

QUESTION:

7

MS. MAHONEY:

Of our Court.
In that, it was a case involving the

8

question of whether or not an action which was brought by the

9

State of California to enforce its tax levy could be removed to

10

federal court as a federal question.

11

question, this Court had to decide whether or not ERISA

12

preempted that cause of action in its entirety such that it

13

couldn't proceed in state court.

And in looking at that

And the Court very explicitly said, we don't answer

14
-

Ms. Mahoney, was the Franchise Tax Board

15

the question of whether or not ERISA precludes garnishment.

16

That's a question that has got to be answered under the

17

substantive law of ERISA.

18

whether or not the trustee should comply with a writ of

19

garnishment is one which has to be answered under common law

20

principles developed by this Court pursuant to ERISA.

In other words, the question of

So it seems to me that the question in this case is

21
22

whether or not the garnishment action that has been brought by

23

the Respondent in this case conflicts with the substantive law

24

of ERISA.

25

maintain that it conflicts in two respects.

And essentially the Petitioners in the United States

21

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

First, they say it conflicts because ERISA was

1
2

intended to prevent any creditor from ever asserting a claim

3

for garnishment against the fund, or ever attempting to

4

alienate the benefits in favor of creditors; that that was a

5

substantive protection which ERISA was intended to provide

6

which would be destroyed.
Second, they maintain that ERISA was intended to

7

8

prevent the fund itself from having to endure the burdens of

9

garnishment.
With respect to both of these issues, I think the

10
11

answer is that there simply is no such federal purpose under

12

ERISA.

13

separately, it becomes apparent why.

And that if we look at each of these questions

14

First, on the question of whether or not Congress

15

intended to protect beneficiaries in all welfare plans from

16

involuntarily alienation of benefits, we look first to what

17

ERISA says on this subject.

18

Under Section 206(d), Congress very explicitly

19

provided that pension benefits cannot be alienated, can't be

20

alienated in an involuntary or a voluntary fashion.

21

it did that,

22

law, and I think it's important to understand how you protected

23

benefits, or wages, or property from creditors at common law in

24

order to understand the significance of what Congress did.

25

And when

it was acting against the backdrop of the common

Essentially at common law any property in the hands

22

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

of a third party could be alienated in favor of creditors
unless it had been donated, placed in the trust and the trust
had a spendthrift clause.
So when Congress came to this problem for pension
benefits, it went ahead and it required that pension -promises to pay pension benefits have to be funded, they have
to be placed in a trust, and they have to have a spendthrift
clause.
QUESTION:

Well, Ms. Mahoney, Congress also, though,

enacted Section 514, and that's what obviously the government
and the Petitioner are relying on.

And in the process,

Congress also, in 514(b)(&), exempted domestic relations orders
from the preemptive effect of 514(a).
Now why would it have done that if it didn't think it
had prevented in 514(a) the garnishment pursuant to a child
support order, for example?
MS. MAHONEY:

substantive law question.

It

It was directed at the

to 514 for domestic relations order does, because it says that
the substantive law of whether or not a wife is entitled to
support will be determined under the state law of domestic

QUESTION:

Well, aren't most of these domestic.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

garnishment order if there are some funds to do it?
MS. MAHONEY:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, it could be —

And isn't that legitimately a concern of

Congress in exempting it?
MS. MAHONEY:

Yes, it is, except that the domestic

relations exception does something much broader than
garnishment itself.

It actually provides that the plan -- that

the issue of rights to benefits is to be decided under state
domestic relations law, not under federal law, and -QUESTION:

But it may also affect the garnishment.

MS. MAHONEY:
garnishment.

It certainly may affect the

But I think that you -- that the exception is

necessary only to the extent that it affects the substantive
law.

And that in this case, no exception to, or no exemption

from 514 is necessary, because federal substantive law does
have to govern the question of whether or not the trustee is
obligated to comply with the garnishment order.

I think that

is the critical difference, and that's why the exception for
domestic relations orders shouldn't be read to just mean that
any garnishment has to be approved by a specific exemption to
the section, because it did much more than approve garnishment
orders.
In fact, it's not even clear that garnishment orders
itself are within the specific definition of domestic relations

24
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

orders.
QUESTION:

Let me ask you, since you are interrupted,

about this particular Georgia law.
It seems to me that under the terms of the Georgia
law, even if we agreed with you on the scope of 514, we would
still have to reverse because the Georgia Supreme Court was
certainly -- it took a very odd view of the effect of the
Georgia law, didn't it?
MS. MAHONEY:

You are referring to the section which

exempts ERISA plans from garnishment?
I think that the section which exempts ERISA plans
from garnishment has to be preempted by Section 514.

And the

Georgia Supreme Court was correct in that, because that
section, its only purpose is to regulate ERISA plans.
In effect, what the exemption does is it says trusts
in the State of Georgia have valid spendthrift clauses whenever
they are created for an ERISA plan beneficiary. That will
create the precise disuniformity which Congress intended the
preemption clause to establish.
If Georgia is permitted to say that in our state
spendthrift clauses are in force, then there will not be a
uniform substantive law governing trust administration
throughout the United States, and that's why this Court in
Franchise Tax Board said that the question has to be answered
under the federal common law developed under ERISA and cannot

2

And also, Your Honor, to the extent that that section

3

is preempted, the rest of the garnishment laws remain in tact,

4

and the remedy can proceed.

5

QUESTION:

Do you happen to know if prior to the

6

enactment of ERISA going back in the early days in Georgia, and

7

prior to the enactment of the particular statute that you just

8

say is preempted, the one relating to ERISA, would the

9

garnishment been appropriate in Georgia of a, just say there

10
11

was a state-administered plan like this?
MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, I don't now of a specific

12

case, but I believe that the general principles of garnishment

13

that were applicable in Georgia would have permitted this

14

garnishment because there was no general exception for benefits

15

of any type.

16

In fact, there is no exception for vacation benefits

17

that are not in an ERISA fund under the Georgia law.

18

is no indication that Georgia, independent of ERISA, would have

19

wanted to protect these particular kinds of benefits.

I was just

Heritage Reporting Corporation

2

trust funds like this even before ERISA was enacted.
MS. MAHONEY:

Well, one of the things that I think is

3

important to keep in mind here is that the specific funds are

4

vacation funds.

5

occurs just in the ordinary course of wage garnishment, because

6

the vast majority of American workers are paid vacation pay

7

through their regular wage distributions.

8
9

And ordinarily garnishment of vacation funds

And, in fact, the Department of Labor has found that
vacation pay shouldn't even be subject to ERISA except to the

10

extent it's placed in a trust fund, because Congress didn't

11

have any substantive intent to protect vacation pay.

12

And what that really says here is that Congress must

13

not have intended to prevent the alienation of vacation pay in

14

favor of creditors.

15

subject to ERISA.

16

reason to find that vacation pay should be protected from

17

alienation simply because it's been put in an ERISA fund.

18

QUESTION:

Otherwise, all vacation pay should be
Nor can it be said that there is a good

Well, you get two kinds of vacation pay.

19

Some just pay the regular salary when an employee is on

20

vacation and that, of course, would be subject to garnishment

21

if he just got his salary.

22

But if you put it in a fund, it's not payable until

23

the employee accrues the amount that would be distributed when

24

he gets his vacation, he or she gets his vacation.

25

MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, it cannot be garnished

27

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

until that point in time either.
QUESTION:

Well, of course not, because there is no

vested interest in it until —
MS. MAHONEY:

That's right.

So, in other words, the garnishment works precisely
the same way.

Under the Georgia law, the creditor is not

entitled to obtain that vacation pay until the date in which it
in fact can be paid to the employee.
QUESTION:

Right.

MS. MAHONEY:

And when it garnishes wages, it's not

entitled to the wages until the date on which it is payable to
the employee.
QUESTION:

Right.

MS. MAHONEY:
In fact,

So they are really indistinguishable.

it's just happenstance that vacation pay is in a trust

fund in this case.

It only occurs really because these are --

it is an industry where they have multiple employers during the
year, and therefore the only way to provide vacation benefits
is through a trust fund of this type.
But it is very difficult to look at the issue of
vacation pay and to say that Congress had an affirmative intent
to make sure that vacation benefits would not be subject to
claims of creditors.
In fact, it's the Department of Labor's position on
vacation pay by adopting a regulation which takes vacation pay

28
Heritage; Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

outside of the scope of ERISA is the best evidence of the fact
that Congress didn't intend to provide this kind of substantive
protection to vacation pay.
QUESTION:

Ms. Mahoney, the government has given us

its best shot at a general rule to determine what "relating to"
means.
What is yours?

What is the general rule that

includes this case and also helps us in future cases?
MS. MAHONEY:

I think the general rule has got to be

that, first of all, state procedures are not laws that relate
to ERISA plans even though they might burden ERISA plans,
except to the extent they are in conflict with the substantive
requirements of ERISA.
And I say that because if you look to the statute, it
seems very clear that Congress did not intend to preempt state
procedures.

Congress preserved concurrent jurisdiction.

It

provided certain procedural requirements for cases brought in
federal court which it did not impose on the state courts
hearing the same actions such as service of process and venue.
And with respect to the kind of procedure that's in
issue here, procedures in aid of execution of judgments, there
simply are no federal procedures in aid of execution of
judgments.
QUESTION:

Well, it seems to me this is a procedure

if you look at it from the standpoint of the creditor, or from

29
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

the standpoint of the debtor, but I don't know that from the
standpoint of the garnishee getting an order from the court is
a procedure.

It's no different from a tax assessment, it seems

to me.
MS. MAHONEY:
like a subpoena.
69.

Well, I think, Your Honor, it's more

It's been defined as a procedure under Rule

It is a writ, that's what it is.

It has been defined as a

procured under the Consumer Credit Protection Act which governs
garnishment, and even in the Rules Enabling Act that gives this
Court the power to adopt federal rules, it says Rules of
Procedure include writs.
So I do think that it is a procedure.

It's much like

a subpoena.
When the trust fund obtains a subpoena to come and
testify and bring records, it is very, very burdensome, and
nobody likes getting them, but certain -- and it certainly
burdens the plan in much the same way that the garnishment writ
burdens the plan.

But I don't think that 514 was meant to

totally displace all of the judicial remedies which are used in
both state and federal courts.
And essentially I don't think -- it doesn't serve to
adjudicate liability.

It only serves to take liability which

is already established.
QUESTION:

What about an order and execution of

judgment; is that a procedure?

30
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

MS. MAHONEY:
QUESTION:

So any state judgment --

MS. MAHONEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

The judgment itself.

So long as you can get a judgment in state

court, you can execute it against the ERISA trust.
MS. MAHONEY:

I think that's correct except to the

extent that it would contravene the substantive provisions of
ERISA.

I mean that's what Franchise Tax Board does very

explicitly, and says that you have to look to see whether or
not a third-party remedy would be inconsistent with the
substantive law governing ERISA.

And I think that's where the

line has got to be.
If it conflicts with the purposes of ERISA, if ERISA,
for instance, was intended to preclude alienation, then
certainly it is preemptive.

But unless ERISA in fact intends

to preclude alienation, or intends to prevents burdens on
plans, plans themselves, then I do not think that it can be
preempted.

There has to be a conflict with the substantive law

of ERISA before —
QUESTION:

So you say then that even if ERISA would

provide that you can't get a hold of these vacation benefits,
nonetheless, the garnishment process would be in force?
MS. MAHONEY:

No, Your Honor.

Well, the procedure

would be in force, but there would be no right to recover.

Congress said that it would be inappropriate to do so, and that
is a perfectly valid answer which would have to preempt any

But, counsel, I have trouble with this

MS. MAHONEY:
QUESTION:

I guess you call execution a procedure.

MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor.

Yes, Your Honor, I would.

That's a procedure?

MS. MAHONEY:

Yes, it is.

Under Rule -- you're

talking about execution of judgments, I assume.
QUESTION:

I said executions.

MS. MAHONEY:

Oh, I'm sorry, Your Honor.

I don't think that's provided for under Rule 69.

32
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

Whether you call garnishment a procedure, which Rule 69 does
call it, or whether you say that it in fact is a creditor's
remedy, the answer should be the same.
QUESTION:

Well, do you see a difference between the

procedure of asking you to testify and the procedure of taking
your money away from you?

Do you think they are both

procedures, right?
MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, in this case I do,

because -QUESTION:

They are a little different, though,

aren't they?
MS. MAHONEY:

Yes, they are different.

asking for something different.

They are

But when they ask for the

money, they are not attempting to adjudicate liability on the
part of the fund.

We're talking about a liability which is

established, a liability that is due not to the garnishee but
rather, to the beneficiary.
And the only -- the significance of the writ of
garnishment is it says instead of paying over the money you owe
to the beneficiary, you pay 25 percent of it, in the case of
wages, over to us.
QUESTION:

It's very similar to — it's equivalent —
You mean as to the person with the money,

it's just a procedure.
MS. MAHONEY:

To the person with the money, it is a

procedure, yes.

33
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

The trust doesn't dispute that the monies are owed to
the beneficiary, and it discharges their liability to the
beneficiary.

They just claim that it's burdensome to have to

do it just as it is burdensome -- I mean their complaint is not
about having to give the money.

It's about the fact that they

have to go through the burdens attendant to garnishment, and
that's an argument that's been rejected by this Court before.
In FHA v. Burr, the federal agency said we can't be
subject to garnishment for our employees' wages because it's
too burdensome.

It requires us to process these claims, and

the Court said, no, that is an important part of the judicial
process unless Congress expressly says you are relieved from
that burden.
QUESTION:

Well, that didn't involve an ERISA plan

though.
MS. MAHONEY:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, it didn't.

So I think that -- unless you are dealing

with Section 514, that probably isn't a good precedent.
MS. MAHONEY:

Well, the reason that I think it is a

good precedent is because it says that garnishment is viewed as
a normal incident of the judicial process.

And unless you are

immune from suit, or unless Congress expressly says you are not
subject to garnishment, you are.
And I think that when you look at 514, it really
can't be construed as an expressed direction that no

34
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

garnishment can be permitted, and that's why I think that the
case in fact is very much on point.
Why is it that the trust funds are exempt from
garnishment?

Is it because it's simply a burdensome procedure?

Well, if so, then why aren't they also exempt for a subpoena
directing them to produce all their records and come and
testify?
QUESTION:

Well, I think the Solicitor General

doesn't point so much to that as it does a protection of the
benefits themselves.
MS. MAHONEY:
question.

Okay, that is a very different

To the extent that Congress intended to protect the

benefits from alienation, there is no question that the
substantive federal law has to govern.
I do not think, though, that ERISA reflects an intent
to protect the beneficiaries from alienation of vacation
benefits.

Congress knew how to protect benefits.

They knew

that they needed to put them in a trust fund, and they needed
to have a spendthrift clause.

That's what they did for pension

QUESTION:

it?

That's what this turns on, doesn't

What does "relate to" mean?
MS. MAHONEY:

Yes, Your Honor, except that I don't

35
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

believe that the "relate to" language should be construed to
apply to a third-party action when Congress didn't even address
the question of what remedies would be available to third
parties.
I don't think that this is really any different than
let's say a cause of action by an accountant for breach of
contract against the fund.

That would require the fund to pay

out monies that otherwise could be paid to beneficiaries if
they were held liable, and there is no federal creation of a
cause of action for such creditors.
Nevertheless, it would relate to the fund in the same
way that garnishment relates to the fund.

But I can't believe

that Congress intended to preempt all third-party actions, and
that really was the essence of the holding in Franchise Tax
Board.

Was that for those remedies that Congress doesn't speak

to, remedies by parties other than trustees and beneficiaries,
they are preserved except to the extent they are inconsistent
with the federal substantive law under ERISA.
And so we are back to the question, the key question
in this case of whether or not Congress intended to prevent the
alienation of vacation benefits.
QUESTION:

May I just clarify one.

I think I know

the answer, but I want to be sure.
You do agree, do you not, that if this were a pension
plan, you could not garnish the --

MS. MAHONEY:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And you emphasized the fact that welfare

plans and pension plans are treated differently under the
statute.
MS. MAHONEY:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

But then in Franchise Tax Board, it was a

welfare plan, wasn't it?
MS. MAHONEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, it was, Your Honor.

Then how to you explain that case?

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, Franchise Tax Board I think is

critical to the analysis here, because in Franchise Tax Board
the state brought an action to collect on its tax levy in state
court.

They did it under a state cause of action.

The

trustees of the plan that were sued removed the case to federal
court, and the question which was ultimately decided by this
Court was whether or not the removal was proper.

And they

found that they had to answer two questions in determining
whether or not the removal was proper.
The first was whether or not that cause of action
raised a federal question on its face.
was it does present a federal question.

And the answer given
The federal question

is whether or not the trustees are obligated to comply with the
levy.

But that is raised by way of defense.

Therefore, it's

not removable under the well pleaded complaint rule.
But the looked to a second question, and that was

1

whether or not it was removable because the cause of action

2

itself was preempted in its entirety by ERISA.

3

said it was not.

4

the question -- in fact, it says that ERISA neither creates nor

5

expressly denies any cause of action in favor of state

6

governments to enforce tax levies or for any other purpose.

doesn't purport to reach every question relating to plans

covered under ERISA.

This Court said that ERISA does not speak to

QUESTION:

But then, as I remember the legislative

history the government cites on (b)(7), refers to the Ninth

Circuit decision in Franchise Tax Board.

That's correct.

Now was that before our decision?

What's

Your Honor, I believe —

See, that seems inconsistent with your

position, or am I missing something?
MS. MAHONEY:

No, I think you are correct.

I think

21

it is inconsistent with the position.

I don't have a reason to

22

say that it is different.

23

when Congress looked at the Franchise Tax Board opinion, that

24

opinion didn't consider whether or not the substantive law of

25

ERISA could be used to prevent garnishments which were

The only thing I could say is that

38
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

inconsistent with the purposes of ERISA.
And it may well be that if Congress had understood
the issue in that fashion, they wouldn't have found that
garnishment should be precluded, because they may have been
concerned that garnishments could occur even where plan
benefits should not be subject to alienation.
QUESTION:

Before the (b)(7) amendment, had the

courts been allowing — in alimony and child support cases, had
they been allowing collections from pension trusts as well as
welfare trusts?
MS. MAHONEY:
QUESTION:

They had.

MS. MAHONEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, they had, Your Honor.

They had been allowing them.

Which was really inconsistent with --

normally thought to be inconsistent with that spendthrift -MS. MAHONEY:

Yes, but they found an implied

exception essentially.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MS. MAHONEY:

I don't think that those cases are

particularly germane to the issue of whether or not non­
domestic relations orders can be enforced against a plan or not
though.
QUESTION:

Can you refresh my recollection on one

other thing?
Why isn't the Respondent defending the case itself?

Why were you appointed?

This isn't a moot case is what I wanted to be sure MS. MAHONEY:

3

No, Your Honor, it's not a moot case.

4

They still very much would like to have the monies collected,

5

but they simply didn't want to invest anymore monies in the

6

case.

QUESTION:

I see.

I take it you are defending the

judgment below and also the rationale?
MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, yes, that is correct.

10

QUESTION:

You defend every step in that.

11

QUESTION:

Well, that's quite wrong.

You said you

12

thought the statute was preempted, the Georgia statute that

13

they construed.

14

MS. MAHONEY:

The section of the Georgia statute

15

which purports to provide —

16

QUESTION:

17

You rely on the general garnishment statute.

18

MS. MAHONEY:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

)

You say you don't rely on that statute.

That's correct, but that --

So that's a very different argument than

the Georgia court made.
MS. MAHONEY:

Well, the Georgia court simply said

22

that that section of the Georgia law which purports to provide

23

an exemption from garnishment is preempted, and it didn't go

24

into detail in looking at what else there was, but they

25

affirmed the order of garnishment, so they presumably found

40
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

that the rest of the statute remained in tact, and I think that
that is the analysis.
QUESTION:

The Georgia court did say that this state

was preempted.
MS. MAHONEY::
QUESTION:

Yes.

MS. MAHONEY:
QUESTION:

They said that the section --

Yes, Your Honor, they did.

But then it went on and did what?

MS. MAHONEY::

It went on and upheld the garnishment

orders -QUESTION:

Because?

MS. MAHONEY:

-- because the rest of the statute was

not preempted and the garnishment was consistent with ERISA.
QUESTION:

I thought they thought that ERISA

affirmatively permitted garnishment.
MS. MAHONEY::

They did.

In other words, they found

that -QUESTION:

Sort of a negative inference from --

MS. MAHONEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, the inference which I think --

And you defend that?

MS. MAHONEY:

Oh, absolutely; oh, absolutely.

I

think that ERISA very much intended to permit creditors'
remedies against welfare plans, particularly in the case of
benefits such as vacation pay.
QUESTION:

Well, if that's so, that's all the court

41
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

below needed to say.

2

permit garnishment, a state should not be able to except it.
MS. MAHONEY:

That's correct.

I believe that is what

the Georgia Supreme Court said.
QUESTION:

If the ERISA affirmatively intended to

Well, they didn't even need to mention 514

then.
MS. MAHONEY:

7

Well, I think they mention 514 in that

8

that is the expressed preemption clause.

9

but you are right, it would be preempted even if there were not

10

So to that extent,

an --

11

QUESTION:

Yes.

12

MS. MAHONEY:

13

But on the question of whether or not — I really

-- expressed preemption clause.

14

think that the key question here is whether or not there is,

15

under this Court's power, to create common law of trusts,

16

whether or not there is a policy reason in favor of preventing

17

the alienation of vacation benefits held in a fund.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, Ms. Mahoney.

19

Mr. Mathews, you have six minutes remaining.

20

MR. MATHEWS:

Your Honor, obviously Ms. Mahoney and I

21

are in sharp disagreement, but I think the lines are well

22

drawn, and I don't think I have to take any more time of this

23

Court.

24

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

25

The case is submitted.

Thank you, Mr. Mathews.
