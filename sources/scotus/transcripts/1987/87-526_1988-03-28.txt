ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN H. STEINGLASS, ESQUIRE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STEINGLASS:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice,

11

and may it please the Court, the issue presented by this

12

case is wehther states like Wisconsin, which opened their

13

courts to 1983 actions, may rquire

14

with notice of claims statutes.

15

1983 plaintiffs to comply

Had Bobby Felder filed this 1983 action in the

16

federal courts he would not have been required to comply with

17

the Wisconsin notice of claims statute.

18

The Wisconsin Supreme Court acknowledged this,

19

but characterized the notice of claim requirement as a

20

procedural requirement, and relying in part on the Tenth

21

Amendment, held that state courts entertaining 1983 cases

22

could require compliance with state procedural rules

23

such as notice of claim requirements.

24
25

Despite this characterization of the notice of
claim requirement as procedural, the requirement has nothing

to do with regulating the conduct of litigation in the

2

state courts.

its origin in legislation enacted in response to the

4

Wisconsin Supreme Court's abrogation of governmental tort

5

immunity in 1962.

6

The notice of claim statute in Wisconsin has

In addition to partially restoring governmental

7

immunity, the notice of claims statute established a con­

8

dition precedent for commencing or maintaining civil actions

9

in the state courts of Wisconsin against local governmental

10

entities and their employees.

11

To maintain such a suit, a prospective plaintiff

12

must serve a written notice of the circumstances of the claim

13

within 120 days of the event giving rise to the claim.

14

a governmental employee is a defendant, as in the present

guidance as to what this prejudice requirement means or how

Court has never addressed a case

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Nonetheless,

7

1

we believe that decisions of this Court construing essential

attributions of a Section 1983 cause of action lead to the

3

conclusion that the notice of claim requirement is improper.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Steinglass, let me ask before you

5

launch into that another question about the meaning of the

6

state statute.

7

state court is against the employee in his individual capa­

8

city?

9

Does it require or apply if the suit in the

MR. STEINGLASS:

I believe not, Your Honor.

I

10

believe the statute refers to suits against the employee for

11

acts done in their official capacity or in the course of their

12

agency- or employment.

13

QUESTION: And your suit here or the plaintiff's

14

suit here was against employees in both their official

15

capacity and their individual capacity?

16

MR. STEINGLASS:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

20
21

22
23

That is correct.

But the court below didn't make any

distinction, I gather.
MR. STEINGLASS:

That is also correct.

That is

also correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Did you ask the court to make such a

distinctijn?
MR. STEINGLASS:

Well, I think the central

24

argument that was made in the case below was that the notice

25

of claim requirement was simply inapplicable to 1983 cases,
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

8

1

and a secondary argument was that it didn't apply as a matter

2

of state law.

3

you raise was in fact raised in the Wisconsin courts.

4

I don't believe the specific arqument that

This Court, in Wilson versus Garcia addressed the

5

appropriate statute of limitations in Section 1983 actions and

6

held that in each state there should be a sinqle limitations

7

period for 1983 litigation, and that that limitations period

8

should be the limitations period for general personal iniury

9

actions.

10

The Wisconsin Court of Appeals in the present case

11

identified the appropriate limitations period in this case as

12

three years.

13

operates to cut off a plaintiff's right to sue short of that

14

full statutory period.

15

The notice of claims statute, we contend,

Now, in support of the notice of claim requirment

16

the Wisconsin Supreme Court identified as the primary

17

purpose of the requirement the desire to settle disputes

18

without resort to litigation, certainly a legitimate purpose

19

in the abstract.

20

purpose when offered by the State of Maryland as a justifica­

21

tion for its six-month limitation period in cases involving

22

administrative agency allegations of employmnet discrimination

23

in Burnett versus Gratten.

24
25

However, this Court rejected that identical

But the Court has noted that in choosing a
appropriate limitations period, a different balance of

(202) 628-4888

9

interests enters into a state decision

2

balance of interests that should be considered when a court

3

is dealing with a federally created cause of action.

4

QUESTION:

than the apprcrpriate

Mr. Steinglass, is your principal

5

complaint here the six-month statute of limitations after

6

the notice is — after the city counsel has refused to act

7

or the requirement of a notice at all?

8

MR. STEINGLASS:

No, I think this case principally

9

involves the requirement of a notice at all.

10

ambiguities of the Wisconsin Supreme Court's decision is,

11

they never addressed whether they believed that the six-month

12

limitations period is applicable.

One of the

13

The Wisconsin Court of Appeals held it was a full

14

three-year period, and the Wisconsin Supreme Court dismissed

15

this case for the simple reason that the plaintiff did not

16

file the initial notice of claim within 120 days of the

17

incident, and did not give actual notice within the meaning

18

of the statute.
QUESTION:

19

So again, we don't know under Wisconsin

20

law whether if you file the notice of claim and it's not

21

acted on by the city council, how long thereafter you have

22

to file?

23
24
25

MR. STEIiNCLASS:

We have no definitive ruling

as to what the Wisconsin Supreme Court thinks about that.
QUESTION:

And you don't know why you didn't go

into federal court instead of the state court.

6

QUESTION:

Yes.

We don't

If the notice of claim

I said, we don't know why your

client chose the state court instead of the federal court?

7

MR. STEINGLASS:

Well, Your Honor, there is

8

nothinq in the record indicating why the plaintiff chose the

9

state courts rather than the federal courts, but Congress

10

gave plaintiffs that choice, and that is part of our system

11

of concurrent jurisidction, and I have practiced law in

12

Wisconsin for many years, and the Wisconsin courts are per­

13

fectly fine courts, quite capable of dealing with 1983 issues

14

and other federal rights, and the plaintiff made that

15

decision.

2

QUESTION:

I don't see exactly why the length of

the limitations period is involved here.

3

MR. STEINGLASS:

Well, Your Honor, it seems to us

4

that if there is a three-year limitations period using the

5

period identified by the Wisconsin Court of'Appeals in this

6

case,

7

that entitles a plaintiff to wait that full period.
QUESTION:

But the Supreme Court of Wisconsin

8

never got to .this question, as I understand.

9

decided it authoritatively but didn't because your client

10

hadn't filed a notice of claim.

11

MR. STEINGLASS:

It could have

That is correct, but the use

12

of the notice of claim requirement to deny a right to sue

before the expiration of the full limitations period cuts off

14

the ability to go to court.

QUESTION:

But we don't know whether that's true

in Wisconsin or not, as I understand it.

the notice of claim issue as being dispositive.

to address the suitability of different lengths of time.
MR. STEINGLASS:

No, what I really was planning

to address was the way in which the short notice of claim

requirement placed a burden on plaintiffs who were seeking

25

access to the state courts, and what I was going to say was,

I was going to analogize to this Court's discussion in

Burnett about the practicalities of litigation and the

difficulty that prospective claimants often have.

are not aware of the formality of the procedure.

certainly can proceed pro se.

them from doing that, but often they are simply unaware.

There is nothing prohibiting

Well, Mr. Steinglass, it does strike

9

me that just possibly people who want to rely on state courts

10

for their litigation and file suit there generaly speaking

11

have to take those courts as they find them, with whatever

12

procedural requirements those courts employ.

MR. STEINGLASS:

Well, that argument can be made,

QUESTION:

In the FELA cases plaintiffs

Well, of course, with the FELA one

19

can say that Congress was addressing specifically the

20

procedural requirements that were to be met in those cases,

21

and I am not sure that that is the thrust of the 1983

22

litigation, which did seem to be addressed to opening a

23

remedy in federal courts.

24

MR. STEINGLASS:

that an important function of 1983 was to create access to

held is available in both state and in federal courts.

Well, but one can find a focus and

a Congressional intent to effect those very things in

16

that particular Act, but I am not sure one can find it in

1983.

18

MR. STEINGLASS:

Well, I can't point to any

19

specific intent in which Congress said state courts must here

1983 cases or if state courts do hear 1983 cases they must

21

follow these procedures or those procedures.

22

admittedly a very, very bare statute, and yet we must look

23

at the remedy that is created and ask whether that statute

24

should mean one thing in state court and another thing in

25

federal court.

It is

I think the implication of the Wisconsin
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

14

decision is that 1983 will mean one thing in the state

courts and one thing in the federal courts, and the result

of this decision is that in Wisconsin, at least, when

MR. STEINGLASS:

MR. STEINGLASS:

no doubt.

21

Of that there is

In addition to the conflict with the notice --

with the statute of limitations principles, it is our

position that the notice of claim requirement constitutes an

QUESTION:

Could the Wisconsin courts -just

decline to entertain 1983 actions?

5

MR. STEINGLASS:

Well, that possibility is there.

6

The question that would raise, of course, is whether they

7

could properly do so.

8
9
10

QUESTION:

Is there any decision by this Court

either way?
MR. STEINGLASS:

Not with respect to 1983 cases,

11

at least not directly.

12

Court pointed out that the non-discrimination principle would

13

apply, and so if the Wisconsin courts entertained the same

14

type of claims under state law they would not be permitted

15

to exclude 1983 cases, no squarer holding --

In both Martinez and Thiboutot this

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. STEINGLASS:

What would be the same kind of claims?
Well, that's a question to which

18

this Court has not provided a qreat deal of guidance.

19

Testa this Court observed that the Rhode Island courts in

20

claims, but entertained both FLSA federal claims and other

4

QUESTION:

It is difficult to imagine —

Well, you know the Wisconsin courts

entertain those.

5

MR. STEINGLASS:

Well, the non-discrimination

6

principle, to be sure, weights the balance very heavily in

7

faovr of state courts entertaining cases, and I think that is

8

how it should be.

9

more difficult issue which this Court need not address, but

10

at least in response to your question, Justice White, I

11

should point out that the Connecticut courts in 1912 refused

12

to entertain FELA cases.

13

policies involved in the FELA legislation, and what this

14

Court did in Mondou, the second Employer Liability Act

15

case, is, they classified Connecticut's disagreement with

16

federal law as inadmissible, and the Court stated that the

17

existence of the jurisdiction creates an implication of duty

18

to exercise it, and that its exercise may be onerous does

19

not militate against that implication.

20

Beyond that, there is support for even the

They disagreed with the substantive

We read cases like Mondou and Testa as not simply

21

establishing a principle of non-discrimination. States are

22

under an obligation that goes beyond simply refraining from

23

discriminating against federal causes of action, but those

24

issues --

25

QUESTION:

Let's be sure about one thing.

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

There is

17
1

no case here that you know of that says that a state court

2

must entertain a 1983 action?

3
4

MR. STEINGLASS:

That is correct.

That is

correct.

5

But as I was just indicating, the issue, the

6

ultimate issue of the obligation of state courts as a

7

constitutional matter or even a statutory

8

entertain federal causes of action in general or 1983 cases

9

in particular is simply not involved in this case, because

10

the Wisconsin courts have opened their doors and opened them

11

widely, not as widely as we would like, as this case

12

illustrates, but they have entertained 1983 cases.

13

virtually every state in this country has entertained 1983

14

cases with very, very minimal guidance from this Court in

15

terms of what should happen when a 1983 case is heard in

16

the state courts.

17

MR. LANGLEY:

I agree

But there is nothing else in the procedure

The claimant can simply ignore the process after

12

that and file a lawsuit.

13

this case was that there was no attempt to comply whatsoever.

14

The reason that Court does not require or the state does not

15

require participation in the process is, the state does want

16

to preserve these claims, and does want to give a claimant

17

an opportunity to go into court, to file a lawsuit if the

18

claimant feels that that is the only appropriate result, but

these matters short of litigation.

The statute works.

Mr. Langley, does the statute apply at

taken in the scope of employment, and the introductory

capacity or in the course of their agency or employment.

If this claim had been filed -- if the

suit had been filed in federal court, do you think that the

has not decided that issue.

14

the statute are important regardless of whether the litigation

15

is brought in state court or in federal court, but I

16

recognize that the weight of authority in the circuits and

in the district courts is that it does not apply, it does

Secondly, the purposes behind

QUESTION:

I point out here —

Is that because it is close to an

22

exhaustion requirement such as the Court dealt with in

Patsy ?

24
25

MR. LANGLEY:

There is in my judgment in reviewing

those cases very little analysis of why that is the answer.
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

27

However, I believe that the purpose or the reasoning behind

2

the Court is really the application of the 1988 analysis.

3

They look to see whether there is a gap or a deficiency in

4

the federal law before turning to state law, and generally

5

the courts have held that this type of requirement does not

6

represent a gap or deficiency in the federal law, and there­

You say there is no gap where the issue

MR. LANGLEY:

7

MR. LANGLEY:

No, it does not.

If

No, it does not.

What is the purpose of that requirement?
The purpose is, if a claimant, if we

can assume that a claimant acts in good faith, it puts the

city on notice of what the claimant values that claim at.

we, in terms of investigation, determine that this is a valid

That is why the statute is so

One difficulty with that argument is

that if the statute only applies to state court litigation

impact is that you would just channel this litigation into

How can you comply with it after 120

days has run?
MR. LANGLEY:

Again, by any type of actual notice

after 120 days the Court has held that the action is not

barred so long as the claimant can show that the

municipality is not prejudiced.

the requirement that a claimant show no prejudice is a

21

minimal requirement, a minimal requirement.

generally means that we haven't had the opportunity to

investigate the claim.

Of course, there was opportunity, but

may I ask one other question?

which after the 120, initial 120 day period has run you can

comply with the statute by giving actual notice?

4

MR. LANGLEY:

The court has held that the overall

statute of limitations in Wisconsin is three years.

5

QUESTION:

So you are telling me that any time

6

within three years the plaintiff could have given actual

7

notice of the claim and then filed suit?

8

MR. LANGLEY:

I think under the circumstances of

9

this case it is reasonable to conclude that the Court would

10

find that we were not prejudiced, and that had he made that

minimal effort —

If that is true, why isn't filing the

MR. LANGLEY:

If you filed a complaint within three

MR. LANGLEY:

But that is exactly what our court

has said because of the underlying purposes of the statute.

12

They want to afford municipalities an opportunity to address

these matters prior to litigation.

It works very well.

Its purposes are

Within three years the

I don't know what that is, but he gives them actual

MR. LANGLEY:

QUESTION:

The next day he could not sue.

Well, so actual notice isn't enough,

is it?

10

MR. LANGLEY:

He would have to also comply with

That's correct.

He must take the

additional step and show that the municipality was not

burdened.

QUESTION:

And you must wa.it 120 more days to give

the municipality the opportunity to make a settlement offer?

7

MR. LANGLEY:

To make a settlement.

That's right.

8

Once the claim document is filed, and as I pointed out

9

normally if the 120-day time period is missed, the claim

10

document serves as both actual notice and claim, and he must

11

then wait 120 days prior to filing the lawsuit.

Is that it?

How much time after he has given you

applies to the second part of the statute, which is the

Including proving that the municipality

was not prejudiced?

MR. LANGLEY:

QUESTION:

19

MR. LANGLEY:

Yes.

Where has he done that?
He has not done that in this case.

20

The dourt held that while the city was aware that there was

21

an incident, we were not aware that this person would seek

22

as a result of the facts of tha>.t incident to recover damages

23

against the city.

24
25

The court held that in order to comply with the
actual notice requirement you must advise the city, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

42

1

common council, and the mayor that you intend to seek to

2

recover

damages as a result of that incident.

3

We get notices of this type of incident or other

4

types that could result in lawsuits throughout the departments

5

of the city that the common council and the mayor never

6

become aware of, so they can't afford themselves of the

7

benefits of the statute because they are not aware that these

8

incidents occur.

9

In fact, in this case there is a footnote regarding

10

comments made by one of the aldermen who received a call

11

about this incident and who reported it to the chief of

12

police. He indicated that he didn't feel that this was a

13

claim or a notice of claim, that it was nothing more than a

telephone call that he had received from a constituent

regarding an incident that he wanted the department to look

into.

He didn't believe that there was compliance with the

Again, the statute is somewhat confusing because

19

of its two parts and the time frames contained in the two

20

parts, but it has served its purposes well, and it is not,

21

and I repeat, it is not a substantial burden placed on a

22

claimant.

23

claimant had in this case was simply a refusal to comply

24

with the statute in any regard, even though the claimant

was put on notice.

Compliance is minimal.
