CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We will hear argument now

in No. 87-168, Russell Frisby v. Sandra C. Schultz and Robert
C. Braun.
Mr. Fuhrman, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD H. FUHRMAN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. FUHRMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is an appeal from a judgment of the United
States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.

This judgment

was adopted by an equally divided court from a vote of five to
J

five.

The effect of the judgment was to affirm the order of

the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Wisconsin.
That order contained an injunction that enjoined the
enforcement of an ordinance of the Town of Brookfield.

That

ordinance provided for the prohibition of picketing before and
about any residence or dwelling in the Town of Brookfield.
After that ordinance was adopted, the Appellees
commenced this legal action seeking declaratory relief and an
injunction against the enforcement of the ordinance.

They

immediately asked for a preliminary injunction, and that was
granted.
In the request for the preliminary injunction, it was

Heritage

3
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

argued that there was a violation of the equal protection

2

clause as well as the First Amendment, and that particular part

3

of the argument of the Appelles was not ruled upon favorably by

4

the District Court, and there was no cross appeal from that

5

particular part of the order.

6

An appeal from the order as a whole was taken by the

7

Appellants, that is by the Town of Brookfield, and proceeded to

8

the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.

9

Before all of this occurred, I should point out that

10

the initial ordinance adopted by the Town of Brookfield

11

provided an exception to the prohibition against picketing,

12

namely an exception in favor of labor disputes.
j

13

When the town attorney became aware of the fact that

14

that ordinance had been adopted, he advised the chief of police

15

not to enforce it until he had an opportunity to study its

16

constitutionality.

17

After he had reread the case of Carey v. Brown, he

18

advised the town board to repeal that ordinance in deference to

19

this Court's decision in Carey v. Brown.

20

precisely that.

21

The town board did

Subsequently, they adopted the current ordinance,

22

which has a uniform prohibition against residential picketing

23

without any exception.

24

footnote number two of this Court's decision Carey v. Brown in

25

which this Court stated that it was reserving judgment on the

Heritage

And this also was in recognition of

question of whether or not an ordinance that uniformly-

2

prohibited picketing without exception --

QUESTION:

Did it say prohibit; it just said

regulate, did it not?

5

MR. FUHRMAN:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. FUHRMAN:

The â€”

Well, never mind, maybe I have it wrong.
Well, footnote two reads as follows,

8

"Because the Court of Appeals concluded that the labor dispute

9

exception was not severable from the remainder of the statute,

10

it invalidated the enactment in its entirety.

11

therefore found it unnecessary to consider the

12

constitutionality under the First Amendment of the statute that

13

prohibited all residential picketing.

14

statute defective on equal protection principles, we likewise

15

do not consider whether a statute barring all residential

16

picketing regardless of its subject matter would violate the

17

First and Fourteenth Amendments."

The Court

20

ordinance that prohibits all residential picketing without the

21

labor exception.

22

Because we do have an

The fact situation that gave rise to the adoption of

23

these two ordinances was a period of picketing of approximately

24

three weeks that had been conducted by the Appellees and their

25

associates before the home of one Dr. Benjamin Victoria, a

Heritage

5
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

resident of the Town of Brookfield.

The purpose of the

2

picketing was to denounce him as an abortionist and as a killer

3

of babies.
The town board had no desire to get involved in this

4
5

debate.

6

that occurred, and also it was appalled at the very

7

serious -QUESTION:

8
9

However, it was appalled at the invasion of privacy

Now this picketing was at the Doctor's

home, was it not?

10

MR. FUHRMAN:

11

QUESTION:

12

It was at the Doctor's home.

He did not operate a clinic, did he, from

his home?

13

MR. FUHRMAN:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. FUHRMAN:

No, he did it.

It was just where he lived?
That was just where he lived.

In fact,

16

he had two clinics, one in Milwaukee, and one in another city,

17

but not in his home.

18

QUESTION:

None in Brookfield?

19

MR. FUHRMAN:

20

So in oral argument today, I propose to concentrate

None in the Town of Brookfield, right.

21

on three principal points.

The first is that the District

22

Court order was filed, and it was a final order.

23

the residential streets of the Town of Brookfield are not

24

public fora.

25

streets of the Town of Brookfield are public fora, that

Second, that

And third, that assuming arguendo that the

6

1

nevertheless that the ordinance is a valid and constitutional

2

regulation of time, place and manner, and to achieve two

3

important governmental interests, the one being residential

4

privacy, and the other being public safety.
QUESTION:

5
6

the preliminary injunction.
So is our standard of review whether the lower court

7
8

Mr. Fuhrman, we are reviewing, I guess,

abused its discretion in the issuance of the injunction?
MR. FUHRMAN:

9

We contend that it is not.

And I would

10

like to point out perhaps at this point that although the order

11

of the District Court is in form a preliminary injunction,

12

actually however, it has finally decided the constitutional

13

issue involved, at least from the standpoint of the District

14

Court.

15

QUESTION:

You still want to go to trial?

16

MR. FUHRMAN:

No.

Let me explain.

The preliminary

17

injunction so-called said that it would become final in the

18

event that there were no requests for a trial, number one, by

19

any party; and number two, that an appeal would be taken.
So the protect the interests of the Town of

20
21

Brookfield, we did appeal and we did file a request for a

22

trial.

23

Court had already determined that it would be unnecessary to

24

have an evidentiary hearing.

25

But it is clear from a reading of the order that the

And there were two reasons for that.

a trial, the trial would be purely on that constitutional

issue.
j

QUESTION:

13

Mr. Fuhrman, can I ask whether this

14

ordinance would prohibit someone picketing generally, that is

15

suppose a picket was not stationed in front of this Doctor's

16

house, but would a group of people be able to parade through

17

the neighborhood carrying signs and just leave?

18

MR. FUHRMAN:

19

QUESTION:

20

Yes.

What does picketing consist of under the

ordinance?
MR. FUHRMAN:

21

Although the ordinance contains no

22

definition section, in our opinion, picketing would be having

23

the picket proceed on a definite course or route in front of a

24

home.

25

picketing before and about a dwelling or a residence.

Because keep in mind, the ordinance only prohibits

QUESTION:

And that means that you have to be

concentrating on one dwelling?

3

MR. FUHRMAN:

4

QUESTION:

5

That is right.

If you were just walking through the

neighborhood, that would not qualify?

6

MR. FUHRMAN:

7

QUESTION:

That would not qualify.

Suppose you were walking by a home with a

8

picket sign that said,

10
11

"I am against the war in the Asian

MR. FUHRMAN:

In the Town of Brookfield, under this

ordinance, it would be.

12

QUESTION:

And what would that damage be to the city?

13

MR. FUHRMAN:

The damage would be to privacy.

14

Because the ordinance is content neutral.

15

with the message at all.

16

QUESTION:

It has nothing to do

So if you had some people marching up and

17

down these streets saying vote for so and so for sheriff, that

18

would be banned, too?

19

MR. FUHRMAN:

If as Justice Scalia asked, it was a

20

march, the answer would be that it would not be in violation of

21

the ordinance.

22

route only in front of this particular house, any particular

23

house which is targeted, then it would be a violation.

24
25

However, if the pickets actually pursued a

QUESTION:

Do the findings of fact indicate that

there is a commercial area or business area in which picketing

1

can take place, was that a stipulation or a finding?
MR. FUHRMAN:

2

It is an uncontested fact, yes.

There

3

are two commercial areas in the Town of Brookfield along the

4

Bluemound Road.
QUESTION:

5
6

Near this residence, is the commercial

area anywhere near this residence?

7

MR. FUHRMAN:

QUESTION:

9

Is the Doctor's clinic in Brookfield or is

it elsewhere?

MR. FUHRMAN:

No.

It is elsewhere.

area on Bluemound Road from this residence?

QUESTION:

The invasion of the

You are still relying on the threat to

public safety?

11

MR. FUHRMAN:

12

QUESTION:

Yes, we are.

Although you just told me that there would

13

be no problem if the picketers kept moving throughout the whole

14

neighborhood, I mean it is less of a threat if it occurs in the

15

whole neighborhood than if it occurs in front of one house?

16

MR. FUHRMAN:

As we pointed out in our brief, in the

17

event that you have a parade rather than simply a picket, you

18

do have a less hazardous situation.

19

that any walking on the street by pedestrians is dangerous.

20

But it is more dangerous if you have a picket line.

21

you have these people not actually in continuing movement, but

22

you have them moving only a short distance, and then following

23

their picket route, you see.

And you could be walking the

2

same way throughout the whole neighborhood, two abreast or back

3

and forth or whatever.

4

It seems to me that if you are focusing on the fact

5

that it is in front of one house, that it must have something

6

to do with matters other than safety.

7
8

QUESTION:

Well, your record certainly contains

instances of interference, does it not?
MR. FUHRMAN:

9

Well, the record contains instances of

10

interference, which of course goes beyond picketing, such as

11

obstructing the driveway and trespassing upon property.

12

has been pointed out by the Appellees, there are ordinances

13

addressed to those particular problems.

14

discussing today really is the picketing ordinance itself.
QUESTION:

15

Now as

The point that we are

Mr. Fuhrman, would the town prohibit

16

Appellees from standing in the street in front of the house and

17

handing out leaflets containing the same messages as on the

18

signs?

19

MR. FUHRMAN:

No.

It is our understanding that

20

leafleting is not covered by this ordinance.

21

conceive of a situation where a picketer might have leaflets

22

and do two different things.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Now I could

But leafleting is not picketing.

But what is a picket, does a picket have

to have a sign?
MR. FUHRMAN:

He does not have to have a sign.

Suppose he just stands there handing our

leaflets, but he stands right at the one stop, is that

14

QUESTION:

Suppose he just stands in one spot and

hands out the leaflet, is that a picket?

15

MR. FUHRMAN:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

Not a picket.

But if he moves ten feet of the way, then

that is a picket?
MR. FUHRMAN:

If he is moving and following a picket

19

route, he is a picket, right.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. FUHRMAN:

Even if he is not carrying a sign?
That is true.

For instance, although I

22

am not aware of any Appellate Court decisions on this, there

23

have been instances where a member of the Ku Klux Klan has

24

picketed from one point to another point following a picket

25

route in a residential area.

Heritage

And that would be a violation of

14

the ordinance.
QUESTION:

2

Let us assume that he was in a black

3

neighborhood and he walked up and down a whole block and did

4

not concentrate on one house, is that picketing?

5

MR. FUHRMAN:

Then it would not be picketing within

6

the meaning of our ordinance.

7

QUESTION:

Well, he is concentrating on all of the

8

houses there, all of the houses.

9

MR. FUHRMAN:

10

I understand what you are saying.

And

I am simply drawing a distinction between picketing and parade
QUESTION:

11

Mr. Fuhrman, do you say that a single

12

picketer,

13

residence substantially interferes with the residential

14

privacy?

15

let us say present one hour a day, in front of a

MR. FUHRMAN:

I certainly do.

Let us just take the

16

Ku Klux Klan picketer that I just mentioned before.

17

one picket making that route back and forth in front of one

18

home that he is targeting would violate the privacy.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. FUHRMAN:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. FUHRMAN:

Certainly

For one hour a day or half an hour a day?
Yes, ma'am.

I would say so.

Or once a week?
I would say that if he did it once a

23

week, that it would also be a violation of the privacy of that

24

home.

25

QUESTION:

Sufficiently substantial to justify the

15
Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1

First Amendment infringement?

2

MR. FUHRMAN:

It certainly would.

3

The second point that we planned to discuss was the

4

matter of the streets of Brookfield not being a public fora.

5

Now we realize, of course, that there are cases that have

6

substantial dicta indicating a repetition of the cliche that

7

streets are quintessential public fora since time immemorial.

8
9
10

And we believe that the key word in that cliche is
the word immemorial.
QUESTION:

We realize that -One man's cliche is another man's

11

fundamental principle.

12

MR. FUHRMAN:

Be careful here.
Touche.

Nevertheless, I think that we

13

have to really realize the historical origin of this.

Many,

14

many years ago, the streets of Ancient Rome converged upon a

15

public square known as the Forum.

16

buildings were at the Forum, and that Forum was certainly the

17

place of discussion and of debate.

18

derived their names from that location.

And all of the principal

And all other forums have

19

We submit, however, that in 20th Century United

20

States that to say that every street is a public forum is

21

simply a statement contrary to fact.

22

Take for instance, the major arteries of the

23

interstate highway system.

24

that penetrate all of the major cities of the United States.

25

And nevertheless, they are â€”

Heritage

Here you have a system of arteries

QUESTION:

Billboards are forbidden on some of them,

are they not?

3

MR. FUHRMAN:

4

QUESTION:

5
6

I beg your pardon.

Billboards are forbidden on some of them,

are they not?
MR. FUHRMAN:

Right.

But they are cordoned off by

7

cyclone fences from the pedestrians and for a darn good reason.

8

Because the volume of traffic and the velocity of traffic is

9

such that to say that that would be a forum for picketing and

10

other forensic activity is just ridiculous.

11

we have the old cliche or fundamental principle.

12

And nevertheless,

And on the other hand, we have the opposite extreme.
j

13

We have these thirty foot roads in suburban Brookfield which

14

are so small and so narrow that only one car can travel in each

15

direction at the same time, no curbs, no gutters, no sidewalks.

16

Basically, it is an inherently hazardous situation for any

17

pedestrian as a matter of res ipsa loquitur, simply by

18

accepting these basic facts which are undisputed.

19

QUESTION:

That argument might cut two ways.

Because

20

if there are no sidewalks, I presume that when someone has to

21

go for a walk, that person must walk on the street, so drivers

22

should realize.

23

MR. FUHRMAN:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. FUHRMAN:

Or across his neighbor's lawn.

They encourage trespassing in Brookfield.
Well, trespassing is a matter of

N

Heritage

17
Reporting Corporation

1

intent, because of the neighbor consensus.
QUESTION:

2

But is it not normal that in a lot of

3

neighborhoods like that that you do in fact walk along the edge

4

of the road, do you not?

5

MR. FUHRMAN:

6

QUESTION:

This does happen.

So I would think that the drivers would be

7

aware of the fact that it is not a heavily trafficked area, I

8

am sure, and they would know that you have to drive rather

9

carefully.

10

What is the speed limit, about fifteen miles an hour?

11

MR. FUHRMAN:

12

QUESTION:

13

No, it is twenty miles an hour.

Twenty miles an hour.

So it is not high

traffic and high speed driving.

14

MR. FUHRMAN:

No.

And of course, I would concede

15

that any pedestrian on these streets is to some

16

extent --

17
18
19

QUESTION:

That sounds like the ordinance is enacted

for the protection of the picketer.
MR. FUHRMAN:

Well, this is the reason why I am

17

There is no

In light of the preliminary nature of the case, this

18

case may well be more appropriately handled by way of summary

19

affirmance rather than a comprehensive review of the town's

20

claims, claims which we contend lack support in either the

21

record nor the decisions of this Court.

22

The town's case rests fundamentally upon a challenge

23

of two basic premises of First Amendment law.

That streets are

24

quintessential public fora; and that picketing, a legitimate

25

peaceful forum of First Amendment expression is to be permitted

QUESTION:

The District Court or Court of Appeals,

10

MR. MCDOWELL:

The District Court's opinion indicated

that based upon the facts that are currently in the record that

as developed there, that there would be a sufficient record to

20

make that determination.

21

Because based upon the normal assumptions that

However, if other facts are sought to be introduced,

22

such as for example, the question of whether one must move or

further determination.

But before us today, I guess that

Mr. Fuhrman says that he does not now want a trial.

QUESTION:

Mr. McDowell, is this a facial attack on

the ordinance?
MR. MCDOWELL:

The attack is more in line of a facial

attack, in that what the picketers are challenging is the

25

application of the ordinance to picketers in general and into

QUESTION:

So it basically is

Well, if it is, then I take that if there

4

is any set of facts that we can think about picketing to which

5

the ordinance could constitutionally be applied, you lose, do

6

you not, if it is a facial attack?
MR. MCDOWELL:

7

If it is a facial attack, there the

8

question that this Court would have to determine is whether the

9

ordinance could appropriately be subject to a limiting

construction.
In this case, the town in its brief indicated that

limiting constructions might or might not be possible, but that

the town wished to forbid all picketing.
QUESTION:

5

You are not relying on the overbreadth

doctrine then, I take it?
MR. MCDOWELL:

6

The overbreadth doctrine is a point

7

that we have relied upon at various points.

It was not the key

8

issue upon which the District Court granted its injunction.

9

However, the overbreadth doctrine has been raised both at the

District Court and at the Seventh Circuit.

there may well be that the ordinance sweeps substantially

consider in terms of the motivation perhaps of the town in

The reason why picketing may be a

MR. MCDOWELL:

Turning first to safety, the reason

why it is not narrowly tailored to support the safety interests

is number one, because the ordinance prohibits only picketing

activities which can have just as severe an effect upon the

QUESTION:

Could they be arrested for violation of

that ordinance?
MR. MCDOWELL:

That is correct.

They could, if they

QUESTION:

Is there any way that they could not be on

MR. MCDOWELL:

They would be on the streets.

And

there, you have the question of whether such activity would

obstruct the street.

8

the town has not done this -- the point is that the town has

9

banned all picketing irrespective of numbers -- the town could

And there, what one could do perhaps, and

perhaps place some limitation on the numbers of picketers, some

11

limitation on the time at which the picketers could be out

j

13

QUESTION:

Let me interrupt you.

You told me a

14

minute ago that this picketing of forty persons all day long

15

was constitutionally protected.

16

How could they put a limit on, you mean no more than

17

fifty would be the limit, or could they put a limit on no more

18

than one or two?

19

MR. MCDOWELL:

We believe, and obviously this is a

20

legislative question which the town would have to address, and

21

it would present a different constitutional question.

22

QUESTION:

It is not a legislative question.

You are

23

telling us what they could constitutionally do, that they

24

constitutionally could do these alternative things, all of

25

which are different from what you a few minutes ago told me

Heritage

36
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

that they could not constitutionally do.
MR. MCDOWELL:

2

Let me clarify then my statement of a

few minutes ago.

4

something that is constitutionally protected.

5

numbers of picketers could be regulated to the extent that

6

numbers of picketers interfere either with free use of the

7

streets or with the interests of the town in privacy.
QUESTION:

The basic protection of picketing is
Certainly,

Well, specifically, could they pass an

ordinance saying that you may not picket with more than ten
persons in front of a house for more than eight hours a day?
MR. MCDOWELL:

11

We would have with respect to that

12

ordinance the similar analysis that would have to be applied.

13

That is does the ordinance restrict picketing.

QUESTION:

15

I understand the analysis.

I am curious

to know what your answer is.
MR. MCDOWELL:

16

All right.

My answer would be that

ten picketers would raise a severe question, because there

18

would be a question of whether a limitation -QUESTION:

19

20

I understand that there is a severe

question, but what is the answer to it?
MR. MCDOWELL:

21

Okay.

I would say that that would not

22

be constitutional, because there would not be a significant

23

enough impact upon public safety interests to justify the

24

ordinance.

25

QUESTION:

In other words, you gave me the same

37

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

answer that you did before, the picketing that you engaged in,

2

you think was constitutionally protected.

3

alternatives about changing numbers or hours are purely just

4

argument.

You do not really believe that.
MR. MCDOWELL:

5

And therefore, these

The question with respect to whether

6

the picketers would believe that or not, I think would largely

7

be determined if the town passed such an ordinance, would the

8

picketers then challenge it as an unreasonable limitation on

9

their speech.

And that is a question for a future case.

QUESTION:

10

But it is not so much the picketers.

You

11

are giving answers saying that although the town cannot do what

12

it has done, that it could do these other things.

But then

J

13

that seems inconsistent with the answer that you think that the

4

Constitution protects the way that you actually picketed here,

5

which would be prohibited by some of the alternatives that you

6

propose.

7

alternatives.

8
9

So the question is how serious you are about the

MR. MCDOWELL:

I would answer the question this way.

We are serious about the alternatives.

It is possible that

20

some of the picketers' activities might have violated the

21

Constitution under a narrowly tailored ordinance.

22

ordinance, however, is not narrowly tailored.

23

QUESTION:

This

Suppose that we thought that as applied to

24

the picketing that actually had taken place and presumably

25

would take place again, that the ordinance was quite

Heritage

38
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

constitutional, what if we thought that.
Should we not then just sustain the ordinance, or

2
3

what else do you have to offer?
MR. MCDOWELL:

4

I would again go back to points that

5

have been emphasized with respect to the entire discussion of

6

this case.

7

on picketing which took place after the ordinance was passed.
QUESTION:

8
9

What is not involved here is an enforcement action

I know.

But if this is a facial attack,

and suppose we say that as applied to this picketing as applied

10

by the District Court, that this ordinance is quite

11

constitutional.
Now is not your only rejoinder then, well, that may

12

13

be so, but it is overbroad?
MR. MCDOWELL:

14

That is right.

That is right.

15

activity is not protected, then it becomes an overbreadth

16

challenge.

17

QUESTION:

And then what do we have to do, do we have

18

to imagine the reach of the ordinance.

substantially overbroad.

additional facts and so forth put out as to the enforcement

policies of the town, which might need to be dealt with at that

point.

There might have to be

But to do that, we

2

MR. MCDOWELL:

No, but --

We could never decide an overbreadth case

would be applied in these situations.

QUESTION:

9

10

That is not how we do

Overbreadth is --

If it is overbroad, it is overbroad, is it

not?
MR. MCDOWELL:

Right.

Overbreadth is basically a

question of applying the sweep of the statute, and in essence

12

determining that the statute can apply very clearly to

13

protected activity.

14

ordinance which bans all residential picketing in a

15

neighborhood without any concerns.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

And that is apparent with respect to this

Have we ever applied overbreadth to an

ordinance or a statute dealing just with picketing?
MR. MCDOWELL:

I believe that the Thornhill case,

19

which overbreadth was first utilized, was a picketing case. So

20

picketing cases are subject to overbreadth analysis.

21
22
23

QUESTION:

Have you ever checked on how many times

Thornhill has been cited?
MR. MCDOWELL:

I have not checked out how many times,

but I believe with some degree of frequency in my reading of

this Court's First Amendment cases in preparation here.

Well, has the Court confronted a case

17

where the public forum doctrine has squarely measured against

the interest of the homeowner and privacy and quiet?

The closest that this Court has come

to that situation was the Carey case.

And in the Carey

QUESTION:

Granted, you are absolutely correct.

However, I would also point out that in the Carey case in

footnote that this Court indicated that its justification and

6

the reason for its analysis in the Carey case was the presence

of a public forum there.

18

MR. MCDOWELL:

Yes, I think it could.

13

important interests of the picketers in the First Amendment

expression.
Right.

But

15

QUESTION:

Now let us talk about that.

16

What is it that you can only do by picketing that you

17

cannot do by some other form of activity, handing out leaflets

18

and parading around, picketing in the sense in which this

19

ordinance uses the term, parading around the whole

20

neighborhood, handing out leaflets, picketing or doing whatever

21

you want in front of the doctor's offices, what is there

22

distinctive about this, is there anything distinctive about

23

this activity except the invasion of this man's privacy?

24
25

MR. MCDOWELL:

What is distinctive about picketing

activity is that by use of signs and by use of perhaps a

Heritage

44
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

limited degree of movement that it creates a place where people
can determine and people can see a message that is broadcast by
way of signs.
And there is a question that perhaps could be turned
the other way with respect to that, what is the significant
difference between picketing and marching.

If marching is to

be prohibited, what is there about picketing that makes it so
substantially different that there is a more extensive need to
regulate such activity.
QUESTION:

I suggest that if you have a parade in

your neighborhood and then have a picket at your house, that
you will see the difference.
MR. MCDOWELL:

Perhaps so, perhaps so.

But the

essential question though that has to be determined when one
deals with the interest in residential privacy is that this
interest is not an interest in restricting content.

There mere

emotional impact that one may receive from the content of
speech is not relevant.

That I believe is the message of the

Boose case.
What is involved here and what is critical to
remember is that this ordinance would prohibit picketing
activity where it were friendly or unfriendly.

For example,

one under this ordinance could go back and forth in front of
Dr. Victoria's house indicating that Dr. Victoria adhered to
the finest standards of the medical profession.

Heritage

considered without respect to the content of speech.

And furthermore, the presence of the

If the town's real interest is in prevention of

appropriately dealt with in other fashions. But the First
