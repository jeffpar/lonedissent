ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT E. TAIT, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. TAIT:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court.
From appellant's perspective, the single issue

11
12

involved in this case is whether the State of Ohio may be

13

permitted to impose its safety regulations on a nuclear

14

production facility which is exclusively owned and controlled

15

by the United States of America, and essential to the national

16

defense.

17

Very briefly at the time this action arose, the

18

Goodyear Atomic Corporation, the appellant herein, operated a

19

nuclear production and utilization facility located near

20

Portsmouth, Ohio, under contract with the United States

21

Department of Energy.

22

type in the United States, and is the only facility in America

23

capable of enriching uranium to the assays needed to power our

24

nuclear ships and submarines.

25

importance of this particular operation, Congress has mandated

This facility is one of only two of its

Because of the critical

that the Department of Energy be the exclusive owner of all

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

land, buildings and equipment associated with this operation,

2

and significantly that DOE establish radiological and non-

3

radiological safety regulations with which its contractor

4

operators must comply.
Now, as noted in the record, the operating contract

5
6

under which Goodyear operated the facility in question

7

contained a specific provision implementing that requirement.

8

This particular case arises out of a simple Workers'

9

Compensation claim involving a former Goodyear employee, the

10

appellee, Esto Miller.
In 1980, Miller fell from a scaffolding and fractured

11
12

his ankle.

13

and subsequently returned to work.

14

He was paid normal workers' compensation benefits

QUESTION:

I take it there's no doubt here, Mr. Tait,

15

that the regular incidence of Ohio Unemployment Compensation

16

law apply to the Goodyear Atomic plant?

17

MR. TAIT:

There is no question, Your Honor, that in

18

accordance with 40 U.S.C. 290, the Workers Compensation

19

benefits, normal Workers Compensation benefits do apply to the

20

operations of this plant and to Goodyear employees, yes.

21

And there has never been any question, nor has there

22

ever been any dispute as far as I'm aware with respect to those

23

type of benefits. The dispute arose in this case, however,

24

because in addition to his normal workers' compensation

25

benefits, Miller sought to hold Goodyear liable for an
additional award, allegedly based upon their violation of a

Heritage

4
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

specific safety requirement promulgated by the State of Ohio.

2

Now, when he filed this application, the

3

administrative body charged with enforcing these requirements,

4

the Industrial Commission of Ohio, dismissed the application,

5

recognizing their belief that it was preempted by Federal law,

6

by the Atomic Energy Act, and by principles of Federal

7

immunity.,

8

QUESTION:

Not a great deal involved, was there?

9

MR. TAIT:

No, there was not a great deal involved,

10

and in fact there has never been a great deal involved with

11

respect to this particular claim as a monetary matter.

12

However, through a mandamus action that was initiated

13

on behalf of Mr. Miller, both the Ohio Court of Appeals and the

14

Ohio Supreme Court reversed the administrative determination

15

because of what they perceived to be somehow a significant

16

distinction between radiological and non-radiological hazards.
Now, what is clear from those decisions is that

17
18

neither of the Ohio courts understood the issue in this case.

19

They first and foremost refer to this operation as a power

20

plant.

21

recognize the fundamental distinction between an NRC operated

22

power plant and a DOE-owned and controlled Federal nuclear

23

production facility.

24
25

It is not a power plant.

They completely failed to

Thirdly and most importantly, the Ohio Supreme Court
in particular failed to recognize the significance of the
Federal ownership of this particular facility.

the Federal facility is being operated by a private contractor?

difference whatsoever.

considerations as this facility does, nevertheless, this Court

11

in the Hancock decision reiterated the basic Constitutional

12

doctrine that absent express Congressional authorization, such

13

facilities are free from State regulation.

14
15

And we submit that this Court's

Was there any discussion in Hancock of how

to reconcile that with Penn Dairies?
i

16

MR. TAIT:

Well, Your Honor, the Penn Dairies line of

17

cases which are raised by the appellant as a way to try to

18

evade the Hancock immunity in this case, seems to me to involve

19

three different areas of inquiry.

20

of those cases involved contractors that were providing goods

21

and services to the Federal Government as opposed to actually

22

involved with the day to day operation of a Federal facility,

23

in effect, surrogate Government employees.

24
25

First of all, the majority

Secondly, with the exception of the New Mexico tax
cases, I'm not aware that any of those matters involved a
nuclear facility or facilities that had any national defense

input.

2

Thirdly, and perhaps most significantly, however, the

3

Penn Dairies line of cases it seems to me creates a distinction

4

between an impact upon the expense or cost of the Federal

5

operation of the facility as opposed to the day to day conduct

6

of that facility. And I think that's an important distinction.

7

QUESTION:

What if this were a third party tort

8

action under State law not involving an employee.

9

somehow preempted in your view also?

10

MR. TAIT:

Is that

Well, it would seem to me that the

11

question would become the extent of the effect of the action on

12

the operation of the facility itself.

13

action where an employee, for instance, is in the parking lot

14

of the facility and somehow gets run over by a forklift

15

operated by a Goodyear employee, then there is perhaps a

16

question of whether or not the immunity that was established by

17

this Court in Hancock can apply.

I suppose if you have an

18

However, in this particular instance --

19

QUESTION:

What's your answer?

QUESTION:

It is dependent upon the affect on the

Heritage

If the contractor has been

operating negligently, the State tort action will cause the

behavior to change.

3

MR. TAIT:

If in fact the basis behind the State tort

4

action is contractor operation that is basically in compliance

5

with how the Federal Government has instructed him to operate.

6

And therefore would provide some sort of chilling effect on how

7

he operates the facility.

8

that the immunity would apply to that contract because it would

9

go to the very heart of the Federal function.

10

And I guess our position would be

In this particular case, however, we don't have that

11

difficult a situation as far as we're concerned.

12

are literally thousands of pages of safety requirements

13

promulgated by the State of Ohio, enforced by an Agency of the

14

State of Ohio in which they are requiring a Government

15

contractor to comply.

16

QUESTION:

What you have

Mr. Tait, to add on to Justice O'Connor's

17

question, what if there was a Federal Statute that said State

18

tort law shall apply, notwithstanding otherwise applicable

Federal immunity.

20

on the circumstances?

21

Then would you still have to say it depends

MR. TAIT:

Well, if I interpret the Hancock decision

22

correctly, Your Honor, if in fact there is specific

23

Congressional authorization of the type of State activity that

24

is attempted to be imposed on the facility, then that expresses

25

the Federal Government's Congressional intent to allow that
type of application.

QUESTION:

1

Well, here we don't have a statute that

2

says State tort law shall apply.

We have a statute that says

3

State Workmen's Compensation laws apply.

4

MR. TAIT:

That's correct.

5

QUESTION:

And at the time that statute was enacted,

6

as I understand it, what, one-seventh of the States' Workmen's

7

Compensation laws had a provision like this.

8

MR. TAIT:

That's correct.

9

QUESTION:

You say that they regulate the activity

10

rather than they're just monetary.

11

increase the cost to the Government, and I'm not sure that's a

12

valid way to distinguish the cases that respondent's come up

13

with.

14

Workmen's Compensation, I presume, and disregard the State

15

requirements, couldn't it?

16

Well, in a way, they just

Your client can just roll along and pay more money in

MR. TAIT:

You're only talking money.

As a practical matter, Your Honor, I don't

17

think that's possible.

18

disregarding safety requirements, it seems to me in this day

19

and age, that the first thing you're going to have is

20

tremendous labor difficulties where the union is going to say

21

the employer is not encouraging employee safety.

22

employer is engaging in activities that fly in the face of

23

employee safety.

QUESTION:

Supreme Court didn't say we have to obey these State rules.

2

Compensation.
MR. TAIT:

It seems to me that if we would so

3

respond, Your Honor, that's small solace for the union, nor is

4

it going to help our labor difficulties at all.

5

QUESTION:

if you rely on the labor situation, would

6

it not be possible independently of a State requirement for the

7

labor union to negotiate a contract which contained a provision

8

that the employer would agree to abide by State regulations

9

even though not compelled by State law to do so.

10
11

That I

suppose would be permissible under -MR. TAIT:

It seems to me that that's permissible,

12

Your Honor, but again, we would argue that first of all that

13

was certainly something that was not contemplated by the

14

Congress when they passed the Atomic Energy Act, which requires

15

exclusive control.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Tait, isn't there a Code of

Safety, a Federal Code, that your client has to abide by?
MR. TAIT:

Yes, Your Honor.

The important

19

distinction is in fact that the safety regulations which are

20

applied to this plant by reason of the Atomic Energy Act are

21

specifically promulgated by the Department of Energy.

22

safety regulations which the Department promulgates are

23

applicable to these facilities, this small number of

24

facilities.

25

These

Congress so intended in the Atomic Energy Act.

OSHA has recognized that their requirements do not
apply to these facilities by reason of the Atomic Energy Act.

And we submit that if you have such a recognition by another

entity of the Federal Government that certainly the State of

Ohio's requirements --

QUESTION:

Well, the question is what Congress

6

MR. TAIT:

Absolutely.

7

QUESTION:

I suppose if there was some real conflict

intended.

8

between a State regulation and this Federal code, I suppose the

9

Federal code would be supreme.

10

But this regulation that was

violated here, State regulation, --

11

MR. TAIT:

Scaffolding regulation.

QUESTION:

inconsistent with any provision -MR. TAIT:

The scaffolding regulation itself is not

inconsistent with any Federal regulation.

16

17

of regulations that are inconsistent with Department of Energy

18

Regulations, and with which this operation, as I understand it,

simply could not economically comply.

They're clearly are

But the point I believe, Your Honor, as this Court

21

has recognized in International Paper and in Garment and in

22

many of the cases is that where you have an effect, in effect

23

serving two masters, that it creates some sort of chaotic

case basis necessarily negatively impacts on the way this

2

operation is conducted.

3

QUESTION:

Well, I take it you say that absent this

4

permission to apply the State Workmen's Compensation Act, it

5

would be clear that the State could not regulate anything here.

6

MR. TAIT:

That's correct.

7

QUESTION:

And you say that this provision of with

8

respect to the Workmen's Compensation Act wouldn't really

9

change that.

10

MR. TAIT:

Section 290, yes, Your Honor.

And if I

11

may, the United States is going to address that issue more

12

completely and I would like to reserve the remaining time for

13

rebuttal, if I might.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS W. MERRILL, ESQ.

17

AS AMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF APPELLANT

18
19
20

MR. MERRILL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court.
The initial question in this case as Mr. Tait has

21

discussed is whether the doctrine of Hancock v. Train applies

22

to a State that seeks to enforce its specific safety

23

regulations at nuclear --

24
25

QUESTION:

Did Hancock v. Train involve anything like

Section 290 here?
MR. MERRILL:

Hancock v. Train involved what was I
12

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

think a closer question, Mr. Chief Justice, which whether

2

Section 118 of the Clean Air Act constituted specific

3

authorization to the State of Kentucky to regulate a Federal

4

facility, such as Paducah production plant.

5

of Section 118 was if anything much more of a clear

6

authorization on the part of Congress permitting State

7

regulation than Section 290 is.

8

9

QUESTION:

And the language

But if we affirm the judgment here, it

doesn't seem to me we're authorizing blanket regulation of

10

these facilities by the State of Ohio. We're simply saying the

11

State of Ohio can impose a Workmen's Compensation judgment one

12

half times again because of violation of its safety

13

regulations.

14

compensation award by ^go.

15

We know that it can impose the initial workmen's

MR. MERRILL:

That's correct, Your Honor.

I would

16

emphasize however that at some point, you have to draw the line

17

in determining what a workmen's compensation law is.

18

relevant language of Section 290 simply authorizes States'

19

workmen's compensation laws to apply on Federal property and

20

facilities.

21

The

The appellees in this case have conceded that a new

22

provision in the Ohio Statute added in 1986 that allows the

23

Ohio Industrial Commission to issue mandatory orders to

24

employers requiring that they comply with specific safety

25

regulations could not be applied to the Portsmouth Fuel
Production Plant. That by itself suggests that the mere fact

Heritage

13
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

that the State has labeled something a workmen's compensation

2

law or has instructed its Industrial Commission to enforce the

3

law is not enough.

4

Congress had in mind.
QUESTION:

one.

You have to ask the question of what

I might also suggest that circumstances

We don't have that case before us, we have this

8

MR. MERRILL:

9

QUESTION:

That's correct.

I'd also suggest that one-seventh of the

10

States didn't have that kind of a provision at the time this

11

adoption of the workmen's compensation law was enacted by the

12

Congress.

13

MR. MERRILL:

That's correct, Justice Scalia.

And in

14

many cases, the existing legal landscape or the state of the

15

law in effect at the time that the Congress passes a statute is

16

a relevant consideration to look to in deciding what Congress

17

must have meant.

18

But we would submit that there are several aspects in

19

the background of the language and the legislative history of

20

Section 290, which strongly suggest that Congress did not have

21

any but the narrowest purposes in mind when they enacted that

22

particular statute.

23

First, let me address a more general issue which is

24

raised by the appellee's reliance on another Federal Statute

25

and which I think is also relevant in understanding Section
290, and which has not been adequately brought out in this case

Heritage

14
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

because the issue really only arose when the appellees filed

2

their brief.

3

The appellees referred to a statute 16 U.S.C. 457 as

4

being relevant to this case.

5

application of state wrongful death and personal liability law

6

on property which is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of

7

the United States.

8

9

That statute authorizes the

This particular statute is irrelevant, utterly
irrelevant to this particular case because it only applies in

10

Federal enclaves, areas that are subject to the exclusive

11

jurisdiction of the United States.

12

Plant is not a Federal enclave.

13

Commission purchased the site in 1952, it did not take the

14

necessary steps to insure that the property would be subject to

15

exclusive Federal jurisdiction, and so by its terms, Section

16

457 does not apply to the Portsmouth Plant.

17

The Portsmouth Gasification

When the Atomic Energy

More fundamentally, Section 457 does not go to the

18

question of Federal immunities, the question which is at issue

19

in this case and presented by the Hancock decision, 457

20

concerns the question of the scope of state territorial

21

jurisdiction over Federal property.

22

says that any objection to the territorial application of State

23

wrongful death and tort law is waived, but it does not waive

24

any Federal immunities.

25

And Section 457 simply

For example, in this Court's recent decision in
Westfall v. Irving arose out of a tort allegedly committed at

Heritage

15
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

an Army depot which was a Federal enclave. The only reason

2

State tort law applied in Westfall at all was because of

3

Section 457, but no one in that case contended that Section 457

4

constituted a waiver of any immunity that the Federal employees

5

had.

6

were conducting a discretionary function, they would be immune

7

from any such tort action.

And in fact, this Court recognized that if the employees

8

So there's a distinction between territorial

9

jurisdiction and immunities, and Section 457 only addresses the

10
11

former claim.
QUESTION:

Mr. Merrill, may I just ask in that

12

connection, supposing there were a suit by one employee against

13

another arising out of some charge of negligence in the plant.

14

That could be decided as a matter of State law, I suppose?

15

MR. MERRILL:

Yes.

Yes, Your Honor, or a third

16

member of the public entered the property and was tortiously

17

injured, State law would govern.

18

because this is not a Federal enclave but simply because the

19

application of tort law in such a way that it would not

20

constitute a regulation of the facility itself would not

21

trigger the Hancock type Federal facilities immunity.

22

QUESTION:

Not because of Section 457

Well, suppose a member of the public slips

23

and falls as he comes in and says it was just unsafely

24

maintained.

25

the place is kept up in Justice Steven's hypothesis.

Now, that certainly has something to do with how

answer is still the same, I take it?

Heritage

16

(202) 628-4888

And your

MR. MERRILL:

1

Well, Justice Rehnquist, we think it's

2

a more difficult question.

3

difficult question to what extent the application of ordinary-

4

tort principles or State negligence law represents a regulation

5

of a Federal facility, as opposed to simply a regulation of a

6

private dispute between two parties or a regulation of a

7

contractor's relationships to its employees.
In some situations, we think that it would be in

8

9

It would present a much more

effect a regulation of the facility.

For example, if the

10

predicate for the action was the fact that the defendant had

11

allegedly violated a specific State safety regulation and that

12

was constituted per se negligence.

13

be no different from the application of a specific safety

14

regulation in this case.

We think that would really

15

But those difficulties in line drawing with respect

16

to tort actions aren't really presented in this case, because

17

here you have a specific State safety regulation which is

18

clearly regulatory in its effect, and its application, we

19

think, triggers the Federal facilities immunity.
Let me turn then to Section 290, and the reasons why

20
21

we in particular think that Section 290 should not be read as

22

authorizing the application of the State safety regulations in

23

this case.

24
25

First of all, the problem that gave rise to the
enactment of 290 was real a problem very much like that
addressed by Section 457.

Heritage

That is, it was a question of

Murray v. Gerrick, Section 457 was not broad enough to

6

authorize the application of State workmen's compensation laws

7

on Federal enclaves.

8

insurance carriers were resisting the payment of workmen's

9

compensation claims for people injured in the construction of

So the immediate problem that gave rise to the

11
12

enactment of Section 290 was a territorial jurisdiction

13

problem, it was not a Federal immunities question.

14

Section 2 is drafted more broadly than Section 457.

15

not simply apply to enclaves, it applies to all Federal

16

property.

17

that Congress was thinking beyond the question of territorial

18

jurisdiction, we think that the Court should be reluctant to

19

construe that statute as in effect a waiver of a Federal

20

facility immunity, such as the type recognized in the Hancock

21

case.

To be sure,
It does

But given that there's no suggestion in the history

22

Second, there is a specific legislative history in

23

the enactment of Section 2980 that addresses the question of

24

State safety regulations,.

25

initially passed the House provided that no only State

2

laws would apply to Federal buildings and projects.
The Senate amended the bill by deleting this

3

particular reference to State safety and insurance laws. And

4

the Senate report specifically observed that the reason for the

5

deletion was that these provisions were objected to by

6

procurement agencies of the Government inasmuch as such

7

provisions would not only produce conflicts of authority

8

between State and Federal officers, but would also mark a wide

9

departure from the well established principle that Federal

10

officers should have complete charge of any regulations

11

pertaining to Federal property.

12

The House then acceded to the Senate's amendment.

13

And that history, we suggest, is strongly probative of the fact

14

that Congress had no intention when it enacted 290 of waiving

15

any immunity objection to the application of State safety

16

regulations to Federal facilities.

17

Finally, as if to underscore the narrowness of 290,

18

Congress added a proviso to the Statute expressly reaffirming,

19

"by the passage of this section, the United States of America

20

in no wise relinquishes its jurisdiction for any purpose over

21

the property named, with the exception of extending to the

22

several States within whose exterior boundaries such place may

23

be, only the powers above enumerated relating to the

24

enforcement of their State workmen's compensation laws.â

25

Now, again, this does not define what State workmen's
compensation laws means, but it does strongly suggest, we

Heritage

19
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

think, that Congress did not intend Section 290 to be used as a

2

vehicle for enhancing State regulatory control over Federal

3

property.

4

Putting together the background of Section 290, the

5

text and the legislative history, we think that as a matter or

6

ordinary statutory construction the correct conclusion to draw

7

would be that that statute does not authorize the application

8

of anything more than traditional State workmen's compensation

9

laws to Federal facilities.

10

Hancock requires even more.

However, this Court's decision in

As stated in the companion case of EPA v. Water

13

regulation only when and to the extent that Congressional

14

authorization is clear and unambiguous.

15

said about Section 290 as a matter of ordinary Statutory

16

construction, we think it's plain that it can't pass this more

17

exacting standard.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEWART R. JAFFY, ESQ.

22

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE
MR. JAFFY:

23
24
25

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court.
As an employee in the State of Ohio, I'm covered by
the Ohio Workers Compensation law.

Heritage

I'm covered as an attorney

20
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

during my work.

I would be covered if I worked in a factory.

2

I would be covered if I worked for the Goodyear Company, which

3

is an Ohio Corporation, and I would be covered if I worked for

4

Goodyear Atomic, which is a subsidiary of the Goodyear

5

Corporation.

6

General concede that Mr. Miller, the person who was injured in

7

the industrial accident, is covered under the Ohio Workers

8

Compensation Law, and covered pursuant to 40 U.S.C. Section 20.

9

No argument on that part of it.

And in fact, the appellant and the Solicitor

10

What the appellant would like to do is to carve out

11

part of that Ohio Workers Compensation law, persuade you that

12

in fact it is not really workers' compensation, and tell you

13

for that reason it does not enjoy the protection of 40 U.S.C.

14

Section 290.

15

of the facts of the case, some of the history that will explain

16

to you how it is that this provision for additional

17

compensation was placed into the Ohio Constitution and provides

18

this additional compensation to injured workers in Ohio.
In addition to that, I will discuss some statutory

19
20

I'm going to discuss with you today a little bit

interpretation with you.
As is probably clear to you, Mr. Miller, while

21
22

working for Goodyear Atomic, was engaged in maintenance work,

23

he was not doing radiological work.

24

a manually propelled scaffold or high horse ladder, as it's

25

called.

He was standing on top of

The ladder is such that it may be lowered to the

ground, it may be raised to a height of sixteen feet.
21

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

It has a

1

platform on the top of it, and there's a guard rail so that a

2

person does not unwittingly fall off.
What really happened was that Mr. Miller needed to

3

4

lower he ladder.

In order to do that, he first had to lower

5

the guard rail.

6

the ladder starting to lower the guard rail, and what happened

7

was that a projection from the rail, a bolt that protruded,

8

caught the glove that he was wearing, pulled him off balance,

9

he fell to the ground, fractured his ankle, injured his heel.

10

Now, no argument that it happened, no argument that

11

it's covered under Ohio Workers Compensation Law, no argument

12

that in fact Goodyear Atomic is a complying employer under the

13

Ohio law.

14

workers compensation coverage.

Now, there he is in a squatting position on

After he returned to work, he was awarded another

22

type of Ohio's worker compensation and that is called a

23

disability award because he still had some residual disability.

24

And so he received another 16 weeks of worker's compensation at

25

the rate of I think it was $83 a week.

And then he applied for

this award that's the subject of the case here today.

An award

that is called an additional award where there is a safety-

The additional award is provided under the Ohio

I'll discuss the history of it with you in a moment.

4
5

But so that you understand, our Constitution says, if the

6

industrial Commission determines there is a safety violation

7

and that it caused the accident, the Industrial Commission may

8

award no less than 15 percent of what had been paid to this man

9

by way of workers compensation, no more than 50 percent of what

10

has been paid to this man by way of workers compensation, so

11

that the additional award is I think tied into the whole

12

worker's compensation program.
What you have in front of you today is a case that

13
14

involves as a minimum to this claimant, something like an award

15

for additional compensation of $1328.

16

that was filed in this Court cost more than the minimum award.,

17

The maximum award that this individual may receive is

The record in this case

18

$4439.

And that's what we're involved with.

Now, how do we

19

get to the additional award, how did the State of Ohio provide

20

for it.
If I were that employee working in Ohio in 1900 and I

21
22

got hurt in 1900, I would have sued Goodyear Atomic for my

23

injury.

24

1921 Ohio changed the procedure.

25

state that changed that procedure, and I may say a few of these

I had a common law suit is what it amounted to.

By

And Ohio wasn't the only

things about worker's compensation because I assume that you're

23

1

not familiar, and there's no reason for you to be familiar with

2

worker's compensation.

3

They're State matters traditionally.

But in 1912, Ohio provided by its constitution, vote

4

of the people, for a worker's compensation program.

They were

5

much like many other States.

6

this process of adopting workers compensation programs.

7

that there was created a State Industrial Board and the purpose

8

of it was to pay compensation where a person was injured

9

because everybody recognized the old system didn't work.

All states were going through
So

We

10

had become some type of an industrialized society by then.

11

there was in that Ohio Constitution in 1912, a provision which

12

retained the right to sue at common law, the right to sue that

13

employer where in fact the injury occurred because the

14

requirements dealing with the preservation of life or safety

15

had not been met by the employer.

16

So here I am in 1912.

But

I, the employee, have a right

17

at common law to sue.

18

until 1923 because people figured out by 1923 that it was not a

19

good idea to permit the suit, that it really didn't serve the

20

purpose intended by workers' compensation.

21

22

considering here today.

24

additional award which is in front of me today.

MR. JAFFY:

Yes, sir.

I think the history

Well, Mr. Jaffy, would this be a different

MR. JAFFY:

12

I don't think it would be a different

13

issue.

I think it would be the same issue.

I have to

14

emphasize of course and I'm certain the Court understands, in

15

this instance the safety requirement is virtually identical.

to do what I think Goodyear Atomic was entitled to do anyway,

3

which is to totally disregard if it so chooses, what it is that

What triggers anything in Ohio is the fact that there has been

an injury.

Goodyear Atomic --

8

QUESTION:

9

There has to be a violation, too, Mr.

Jaffy, and that's what I'm a little bit hung up on.

I have no

10

problem in light of Section 290 of applying the workmen's

11

compensation law by its terms.

12

Workmen's Compensation law does not apply and does not provide

13

the added amount unless the employer is within the terms of the

14

compensation law, in violation of a safety rule of the

15

Industrial Commission.

The trouble is that the Ohio

So to find that this employer is within that

16
17

provision of the Compensation law, I also have to find that the

18

employer was violating a safety rule of Ohio, which means, it

19

seems to me, I have to find that he was subject to the safety

20

rule of Ohio.

21

Isn't that what the

Statute says?

22

MR. JAFFY:

you and I are both perfectly

So that

clear, I

don't think you have

to make a finding on whether

24

there is a violation or not.

now is a question of may the State of

Ohio proceed to make a

determination that there has been a violation, and if in fact,

Heritage

26
Reporting Corporation

it so finds, may it then award additional compensation.

2

QUESTION:

Well, and don't we also have to find that

3

this employer can be in violation of Ohio's regulatory laws, or

4

can we let Ohio say he's in violation, when he isn't?

5

MR. JAFFY:

Justice Scalia, if I may, I think what

6

you need to find is that Congress provided by 40 U.S.C. 290

its significance.

23

It seems to me the Statute is clear.

And I have

And I think it all goes back to 16 U.S.C. 457 when

24

Congress passed 457, it remitted a tort action, and there were

25

courts, as you probably understand, who felt that 16 U.S.C. 457
applied to Workers' Compensation.

Until this Court decided

think it's at JA-50, a report from the Union safety

to me that 290 was and is written about as broadly as a statute

could be written.

4

people trying to write it in such a fashion that should this

Court come to grips with this problem again, the Court would

understand that the intent of the Congress is to permit

extent.

And you can almost see the Congressional

about as broadly written as anything could be when they say

12

whatsoever authority the State is authorized to handle workers'

compensation has the authority to proceed with this matter.

QUESTION:

Mr. Jaffy, I think what the Government's

position would be is that in the same manner and in the same

extent simply means this, that where a person is not in

violation of a State regulation, he should not be assessed the

not within the meaning of the Ohio Workmen's Compensation law,

Would you agree that Ohio could not

So to that extent, the regulations are

deny them the opportunity to operate as they did in the Hancock

And they also could not close down the plant, or

MR. JAFFY:

Yes.

There's no question about closing

24

down the plant, and very frankly, I think that's the key

25

element with the Hancock case and it involved more, as I'm sure
you know, more than just an AEC operation.

We'd have no problem here of course, and I

I'm not certain that I at all understand the distinction that

you're trying to make.
