Mr. Sawatzky, you may proceed whenever you are

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GERALD SAWATZKY, ESOUIRE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SAWATZKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11

please the Court, the questions presented in this case are,

12

first, whether the full faith and credit clause and the due

13

process clause require Kansas, a quorum state, to apply the

14

limitations laws of the States of Texas, Oklahoma, and

15

Louisiana, where the claims arose in favor of class members

16

residing in those states, and secondly, whether Kansas has

17

failed in this case to apply the interest laws of those

18

same states to those claims as required by this Court's

19

decision in Phillips Petroleum Company versus Shutts, which

20

was an identical case to this one except it did not involve

21

the limitations issue.

22

Sun Oil sells gas from wells located in various

23

states and pays royalty to landowners, thousands of land-

24

owners located in these states.

25

receiver, filed for and received price increases from the

In the 1970s Sun had

Heritage Reporting Corporation

3

1

then Federal Power Commission subject to refund pending a

2

determination of their leqality, and once determined to be

3

legal, royalty was paid on the suspended funds representing

4

the increases to the royalty owners, and such payouts were

5

made in July of 1976 and on another occasion in 1978.

6

Plaintiffs filed this suit in August of 1979 in

7

Kansas state court seeking to collect interest on the

8

principal payout of these suspended royalties on behalf of

9

the class of these royalty owners located in these various

10

states.

11

in states other than Kansas. Over 90 percent of the wells

12

were located in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana.

13

Ninety-nine percent of the class members resided

Now, in the first Wortman case in 1984 the Kansas

14

courts held that Kansas interest law should be applied to

15

all the claims in all the states and also held that the

16

Kansas limitations statute, which it determined was five

17

years, should apply to all the claims in all the states.

18

Thereafter, this Court decided Phillips versus

19

Shutts in 1985, which required Kansas to apply the interest

20

laws of the other states to the claims arising in those

21

states if those laws were different, and it pointed out they

22

probably were different.

23

On Sun's petition this Court then remanded the

24

first Kansas Wortman case back for reconsideration in

25

light of this Court's case of Phillips versus Shutts.
Heritage Reporting Corporation

And on

4

1

Reconsideration the Kansas court, reviewing many decisions

2

in these other states, and not finding anything directly on

3

point, nevertheless held despite this Court's direction that

4

the Kansas theory of equitable interest would be uniformly

5

adopted in each one of these states.

6

Then on the limitations question when we again

7

raised the constitutional objection that the limitations

8

laws were substantive, certainly as substantive as interest

9

laws, where the difference is between 6 percent and 10

10

percent, between liability and no liability, the Kansas

11

court adopted what is a standard black letter conflicts

12

rule that limitations goes, is remedial or procedural,

13

therefore the law —

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Sawatzky, may I ask you a question?

IS

It seemed to me that at least in vour brief you didn't argue

16

that Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma courts consider

17

their shorter statutes of limitations as substantive.

18

MR. SAWATZKY:

19

QUESTION:

Your Honor, the -- I think I —

Do they -- have you cited any

20

authority that would indicate to us that those states

21

regard their statutes of limitations as substantive

22

rather than procedural?

23

MR. SAWATZKY:

No, Your Honor.

Those states

24

follow the common law rule, as Kansas does, as most states

25

do, that the normal statute of limitations such as we have
Heritage Reporting Corporation

5

1

involved here, are considered procedural or remedial for

2

conflict of laws purposes.

3

those states do not apply those laws to claims arising in

4

each one of those states in such a manner as to terminate

5

completely any claim or cause of action that has arisen in

6

that state.

7

That does not mean to sav that

And my whole point, Justice O'Connor, is that the

8

nature of a statute of limitations when it is applied by

9

each one of these states is such that constitutionally it

10

is substantive because it deprives a party of a claim.

11

QUESTION:

Well, I can imagine certainly that a

12

particular state could make a determination for itself

13

that it wanted to treat a particular statute of limitations

14

as substantive, but absent that, I wonder whether we should

IS

assume that it is.

16

NR. SAWATZKY:

I think that in applying the

17

constitution, Your Honor, we must look at what a statute

18

of limitations does to a party and to a claim, and because

19

of the history, the common law history by which this

20

common law fiction arose, a fiction that limitations goes

21

to the remedy and not to the right, which arose way back

22

in McLemoyle versus Cohen.

23

Prior to that time. Justice Storey -- I am getting

24

back into history now, but it goes right to the very

25

essence of this case.

And that is that Justice Storey in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

6

1

LeRoy versus Crowninshield analyzed this common law fiction

2

and from every aspect he concluded in effect that a limita­

3

tions law by its nature was substantive because it affected

4

the substantive rights of the claimant.

5

6

QUESTION:

Well, that certainly wasn't the holding

of this Court in the Wells case, was it?

7

MR. SAWATZKY:

No, it wasn't.

In the Wells case,

8

Your Honor, there was absolutely no reexamination and no

9

constitutional analysis of limitations statutes or their

10

purposes.

11

12

QUESTION:

Well, Justice Jackson certainly put

forward an argument in his opinion in that case.

13

MR. SAWATZKY:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. SAWATZKY:

Yes.

But it didn't carry the day, did it?
It didn't carry the day, Your

16

Honor, because the majority opinion in Wells simply rotely

17

adopted the old McLemoyle line of cases, and if you look back

18

at McLemoyle, likewise it did not analyze the guestion.

19

would think that before we rotely adopt

20

the sake of old times and antiquity that we ought to look

21

at the reason behind the rule and see if the rule stacks

22

up in light of the purposes of our constitution.

23

One

an old rule for

And if we do go back, you will note that

24

McLemoyle and Wells recited the common law fiction that

25

limitations goes to the remedy and not to the right.
Heritage Reporting Corporation
AOU.Jftflfl

Well,

7

1

that is pretty well accepted by scholars that that remedy,

2

common law remedy type of thing was basically something to

3

preserve English sovereignty over England's people and its

4

courts.

5

Now, when Justice Storey, really the only analysis

6

made in the early days was by Justice Storey in the Crownin-

7

shield case, and he examined it by reason and logic and said,

8

in effect, the common law rule is wrong, but it is the lav/,

9

and I will apply it to the case, but that case did not
4

10
11

involve the Constitution.
And if you come to the Constitution, where Kansas

12

must respect the laws of Texas which affect people's riahts,

13

and like any other substantive law, then we have an issue

14

which is not, which is not simply a question of the common

15

law of England.

16

Limitations --

17
18
19
20

We have a constitutional purpose.

QUESTION:

Do you think we have to overrule a

whole string of cases to hold for you on this?
MR. SAWATZKY:
Your Honor.

I don't really think you have to,

I think it would be the best thing --

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. SAWATZKY:

Just ignore them, or what?
I think it would be the best thing

23

that this Court could do to overrule them, because it is

24

an old English common law fiction which has been applied

25

without discrimination.

MR. SAWATZKY:

QUESTION:

8

MR. SAW7ATZKY:

The Third Circuit?
The Third Circuit.

What did they say?
They said that constitutionally

9

under the full faith and credit clause and the due process

10

clause in particular, the common rule in effect, the common

11

law rule should be disregarded because one state should

12

apply the law of another state.

13

QUESTION:

They must have felt that there weren't

14

any cases and this Court finding them that would hold

15

otherwise.

16

MR. SAWATZKY:

Well, I think, Your Honor, you

17

are coming to one aspect of my case.

18

a bigger chunk than I should chew by saying that some of

19

these old cases are wrong, which I think they clearly are,

20

but in Keaton versus Hustler Magazine, this Court said

21

under a due process analysis it would reserve the question

22

of whether or not one state must apply the limitations law

23

of another state where the forum state's only connection

24

was the presence of a suit, the bringing of a suit.

25

QUESTION:

Perhaps I bit off

Do you think in some of the old cases

Heritage Reporting Corporation

9
1

2

did that very situation obtain?
I mean, how could Hustler have reserved that

3

question if there were a lot of cases historically that had

4

addressed that very situation?

5

MR. SAWATZKY:

6

QUESTION:

7

Had they or not?

8

MR. SAWATSKY:

Well, yes.

That --

Had they?

There had absolutely been no

9

cases discussinq, analyzing the due process clause in

10

connection with this problem.

11

consider it.

12

before the --

13

14

The Wells case did not

Certainly McLeinoyle didn't.

QUESTION:

So it's the constitutional issue that

Hustler reserved, you think?

MR. SAWATZKY:

16

here for this Court in this case.

17

19

It was long

QUESTION:

It is perfectly open and right

How is the due process argument

different from the full faith and credit argument?
MR. SAWATZKY:

Well, you look at the due process

20

analysis in the Shutts case itself and in the cases cited

21

by Shutts, and that is that parties are entitled to expect

22

that their activities and their rights and legal

23

obligations will be governed by laws of the jurisdiction

24

where they undertake their activities, and where the

25

alleged wrong or the breah occurs, and that this lends
Heritage Reporting Corporation

10
1

predictability to the law, and this is an element of the

2

fairness incorporated in and an absolute part of the due

3

process clause.

4

expect that this law where they perform their activities

5

will be applied, but not —

6
7

Fairness that the parties reasonably

QUESTION:

Predictability is important when you

are goinq to govern your actions by it.

8

MR. SAWATZKY:

9

QUESTION:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

But how do you govern your actions

10

differently if you know that there is a five-year statute

11

of limitations rather than a nine-year one?

12

time go faster or make it go slower?

13

can do about a statute of limitations.

14

affect your --

15

MR. SAWATZKY:

Do you make

There is nothing you
It doesn't

The statute of limitations, as

16

this Court has pointed out many times and is generally

17

recognized, is a statute of repose that gives people

18

certainty in their affairs, and if you want to go to a

19

state and conduct your activities with a limitation of two

20

or three years instead of five of six years, that is your

21

option.

22

QUESTION:

Do you think anybody ever conducted

23

affairs in one state versus another because they knew they

24

had a shorter statute -- do people really advert to

25

statutes of limitations when they conduct their primary
Heritage Reporting Corporation

11

1
2

conduct?

I can't imagine that.
MR. SAWATZKY:

Well, I don't think anybody has

3

made a study out of it, Your Honor, but that is one of the

4

elements that goes into your expectancy.

5
6
7

QUESTION:

Part of a favorable climate for

business, perhaps?
MR. SAWATZKY:

Well, the point is, though, that

8

in any action there are affirmative defenses, let's say

9

unclean hands or something else.

10

because this law affects the rights of the parties, affects

11

this claim in this case substantively, it wipes it out,

12

or it increases it, therefore it is subject to the due

13

process clause, and you look to the lav/ of the state and

14

jurisdiction that has an interest in that.

15

QUESTION:

Normally we say that this,

But one can certainly make the argument

16

in the case of the statute of limitations that the primary

17

interest it serves is that of a state, the state's court

18

system in not trying to process stale claims which are

19

very difficult to figure out who is right and who is wrong,

20

and that if Texas feels they want a shorter statute of

21

limitations, it is a state interest there that is being

22

vindicated, but if the Kansas court system feels they don't

23

have that same reservation, then why not let Kansas apply

24

its longer statute?

25

MR. SAWATZKY:

Of course, in our case, you

Heritage Reporting Corporation
f?071 67R.4ftflft

12

1

understand, Kansas supplied its longer statute, not a

2

shorter statute --

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. SAWATZKY:

Yes.
-- to bar something, and so this

5

argument technically would not apply, but -- and so I

6

wouldn't need to rebut that particular argument, but I

7

think from the standpoint of logic and common sense, this

8

argument which has been made does not bear analysis, because

9

the interest as far as stale claims is concerned, the

10

parties are interested in it.

11

evidence in this case that has been lost bears upon the

12

parties and upon that claim.

13

every day handle cases where the evidence is difficult.

14

Whether or not there is

Now, our courts all the time,

Whether a statute of limitations has run or not

IS

run or whether any evidence has been lost or not lost,

16

the state where this occurs does not have an interest in

17

the freshness or the staleness of that claim per say because

18

of all these factors.

19

the parties.

20

The interest and the impact is upon

Professor Loeffler, who has been involved in

21

this situation and studied this for many, many years,

22

succinctly summarizes it in the Mercer Law Review article

23

which we cite in our reply brief, where the Uniform

24

Commissioners on State Laws studied the problem, and back

25

in the fifties they proposed a uniform rule that the
Heritage Reporting Corporation
nno\

13

1

shorter statute would apply, adopting this very argument

2

that the Chief Justice has mentioned.

3

to be very unsatisfactory, and his analysis in this article

4

and by the commissioners showed the weaknesses in that, just

5

as I think that I have tried very poorly to mention.

6

But this turned out

And as a result they adopted, they concluded

7

that, yes, limitations laws are substantive, and because

8

they are substantive, the law which should be applied in

9

our uniform law proposal is that you look to the law just

10

like any other substantive law of the state where the

11

activity occurred and the claim arose.

12
13
14

QUESTION:

And that -- taking it both ways,

whether the forum state statute is longer or shorter.
MR. SAWATZKY:

That is correct.

That is what

15

they concluded.

16

they had formerly proposed, and they studied this, and they

17

know about it.

18

They disregarded or they discarded what

Now, the same thing has occurred in England that

Was he recommending a conflicts of law

MR. SAWATZKY:

His function and his role, Your

2

Honor, was in the conflict of laws area, and was proposing

that as a uniform rule.

4

QUESTION:

I have a vague recollection that he

5

is very reluctant to constitutionalize the law of

conflicts of laws.

7

MR. SAWATZKY:

But if you read the article and

8

read the study, and similar scholars, and conclude, Your

9

Honor, that this is substantive, that they are correct

10

in saying it is substantive, once you say it is substantive,

11

our constitution requires us to apply it in that manner.

12

Their role is not to take over the function of this Court.

Mr. Sawatzky, what do you do with

IS

Texas itself says when it enacts its statute of limitations:

6

the reason we have these statute of limitations is, we don't

7

think our courts can find the facts very accurately or

8

efficiently when the claims are older than this.

9

other courts want to take a shot at it, if they think they

20
21

Now, if

can do better, we don't care.
Texas says that.

Our statutes of limitations

22

are jus procedural.

23

neither the full faith or credit clause nor the due

24

process clause would require the forum to apply them, or

25

would you still say the forum had to apply them?

Then you would acknowledge that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

15

1

MR. SAWATZKY:

I would still say, Your Honor,

2

that that would apply.

3

of all, Texas doesn't really say that.

4

procedural, but that is because of this old common law

5

fiction.

6

because it is procedural it affects our ability to handle

7

these claims --

Number One — for two reasons.

First

They may sai it is

And secondly, if they did go further and say that

QUESTION:

It is in the statute.

They have

actually —
MR. SAWATZKY:

In the statute.

I say it would be

11

unconstitutional because it would not reflect reality, because

12

the reality is that the administrative upkeep of the courts,

13

the procedure in the courts is not really affected by

14

whether a statute is longer or shorter.

IS

Loeffler points that out very well.

16

And Professor

And if. you assume that what I am saying is

17

correct, and I think it is correct, then a state's arti­

18

ficially saving that something is true that is not true

19

cannot possibly govern the operation of our constitution.

20

So we come again to the -- I was mentioning the

21

law of England that gave rise to this whole problem.

22

Law Commission made a study and concluded, yes, limitations

23

laws by their nature are sulistantive.

24

in England now is, pursuant to Parliament, that the

25

law of the place where the occurrence happened or the

Therefore the law

The

action is brought in England.

3

Now, there are also movements under foot to

revise the Restatement of Contracts, Conflicts, second,

S

section 142, which recognizing this problem, because you

6

see, in the Ferens case, when the Ferens case, the Third

7

Circuit held that this basically was a constitutional

8

problem, and we had a situation where an accident in

9

Pennsylvania and barred by the Pennsylvania statute was

10

brought in Mississippi, where they have a longer statute,

11

in federal court.

12

So it is brought in federal court, and the conse­

13

and therefore

15

16

of our old common law rule was that it is procedural
you apply the law of Misssippi, which was

Well, then under the forum non conveniens statute

17

you bounce it back to federal court in Pennsylvania, where

18

it was barred, of course, if it had been brouqht there

19

by the statute, and suddenly you have a claim that is alive

20

in Pennsylvania that was really dead in Pennsylvania, and

21

this points out the whole illogic and irrationality

22

of this common law fiction that savs that a claim which is

23

dead and unenforceable in the state which created it, and it

24

is qone, nevertheless lives and survives well in any state

25

that fortuitously may have or later enact a lonqer statute

of limitations, and allow this kind of forum shopping

2

and

3

And this is especially a problem in class actions such as

4

this particular case, because what we will have is a forum

5

state that has a law favorable to one particular class or

6

one particular interest, so a class action will migrate to

7

that state, and that state will then with the longer statute

8

apply the law everywhere and perhaps apply its own law to

9

the other states like Kansas has here and become a magnet

10

state and a state which applies national law which it

11

creates.

12

hopscotching among the states in litigation to occur.

QUESTION:

Where I don't follow you, Mr. Sawatzky,

13

is, I don't see how we can tell a state that its statute

14

of limitations must be substantive, and once you accept

15

that then your scheme doesn't give us any more certainty than

16

the existing scheme.

17

state's statute of limitations to decide whether they

18

really intend it to be substantive or not.

19

is shifting the presumption, I suppose.

20

You would still have to examine each

MR. SAWATZKY:

All you are doing

If a state were to design a

21

statute of limitations so that it would bear a real

22

relationship to lost evidence and to stale claims and which

23

could demonstrably improve the administration of cases

24

in this Court, that might be one thing.

25

But that is not what we have here.

Heritage Reporting Corporation
lnni\ (.oa.ioaa

We just have

18

1

general statutes of limitations which by their nature are

2

statutes of repose for the benefit of people because we

3

live in a world of time and space where we draw lines on

4

the map that give jurisdiction, and we draw lines in time

5

which say we go on to something new, and people are entitled

6

to rely on that.

7

And it is important in civilization, ever since

8

the early 17th century under the King James Statutes, which

9

the Schreiber case in the Tenth Circuit before where the

12

In the Ferens case, they said you can't do that,

13

you can't jump over to Mississippi and come back to

we lose sight of the fundamental question in this case, and

in my opinion the fundamental question is, are our courts,

3

our institutions of justice capable of redressing an

4

enormous interstate ripoff by a large national corporation

5

at the expense of about 3,000 people located in several

6

states, or does the expense of individual suits and the

fact that the victims are located in many of the states

8

mean that the courts can do little for them, and that the

9

defendant can take and use their money with no real fear

of accounting?

11

The facts in this case show that Sun used money

While I have you interrupted, what if

Texas, for example, passed a law that made it crystal clear

it considered its shorter statute of limitations to be

MR. PENNY:

Yes, I do, Justice O'Connor, if Kansas

did not have enouqh other contacts with the litigation to

make its application of its own statute of limitations

11

reasonable.

12

I think the -- I would like to talk a little bit

13

now about substantive and procedural.

14

the labels are very important here, but they are more than

15

labels, and this is evident by the fact that when you

get a -- when the case is dismissed because it is brought

too late for the statute of limitations, when it is an

18

outlawed claim, that is not treated anywhere that I am aware

19

of as a judgment on the merits.

20

I am not sure that

Statutes of limitations have been considered

21

procedural rather than substantive because they have nothing

The attack on Kansas' application of its own

11

statutes of limitation is made on a couple of different

12

grounds, and I would like to talk about the Fourteenth

13

Amendment ground first.

14

As I read the cases of this Court, the Fourteenth

Amendment would not require Kansas to apply the statute of

limitations of another state.

17

Phillips versus Shutts this Court determined what modest

restrictions there are on the state's application of its own

substantive law.

machinery for regulating its judicial process that the

modest.

MR. PENNY:

Yes, I think it was a good faith

5

effort, and I think if one of these cases comes before one

6

of the other courts, Texas, Oklahoma, or Louisiana, I think

7

it's quite likely they would do exactly as the Kansas court

8

did.

10

MR. PENNY:

11

QUESTION:

In spite of a statute.
Yes.
In Oklahoma it says, here's the interest

rate on overdue royalty.

13

federal rate.

14

MR. PENNY:

We nevertheless will apply the

I think that would make it more

difficult.

statute as well which the Kansas court decided not --

17
18

However, Kansas had a general interest rate

QUESTION:

Have you got a citation for the

Oklahoma statute that you didn't have in your brief?

19

MR. PENNY:

20

QUESTION:

Title 52, Section 540.
May I ask if that statute was called

21

to the attention of the Kansas Supreme Court by either

22

party to the litigation?

23
24
25

MR. PENNY:

It was not, Your Honor, and maybe

this is incompetence on our part.
QUESTION:

You at least had a theory that the

federal rule applied.

2

MR. PENNY:

3

QUESTION:

4

Yes .
And they opposed it.

What did they

claim?

5

MR. PENNY:

They claimed 6 percent.

Oklahoma has

6

a general statute or a general interest state of 6

7

percent.

8
9

QUESTION:

But isn't there an issue in here of

not only postjudgment but prejudgment interest?

10

MR. PENNY:

Yes,

sir.

I have been talking all

11

throughout about prejudgment interest, and the only place

12

the --

13

QUESTION:

I thought there was some argument

14

that these other states wouldn't give prejudgment interest

15

at all.

16

MR.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. PENNY:

PENNY:

Yes, there was that claim made.
Well
It would be, espeically with respect

19

to Oklahoma, the claim was made that there would be no

20

prejudgment interest.

21
22
23

QUESTION:

That was a common law rule, wasn't

it?
MR. PENNY:

Yes.

I think that would be very

24

difficult to maintain inside of the particular statute they

25

have on there, and again,

QUESTION:

May I ask about the Oklahoma statute?

2

I understand — neither party cited it, and I understand your

3

theory was that the federal rule applied.

Were you aware of the statute at the time the case
was argued in Kansas?

opponent was or not?

MR. PENNY:

I see, and you don't know whether your

No.

It was never cited to any court

considering --

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. PENNY:

14

I was not aware of the statute until

What about the Louisiana statute?
The Louisiana statute was cited by

the Kansas court in the Shutts versus Phillips case.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. PENNY:

How about in this case?
In this -- the Kansas court's

17

opinion in this case referred -- mostly just referred to

18

the Shutts case, which had been decided a month earlier.

19

20
21

QUESTION:

Well, how come they said Louisiana would

apply the federal rule?
MR. PENNY:

There was a case in Louisiana called

22

Boutte versus Chevron, in which the federal court said,

23

whenever this money is paid out — it was dicta in the

24

case, but the federal court did say, Chevron, you don't have

25

to pay the money out until the rates become final, but when
Heritage Reporting Corporation

39

1

you do pay the money out, you will pay them to the royalty

2

owners at the same -- together with the same rate of interest

3

as you are required to by your Federal Power Commission

4

undertaking.

5

There was also a federal court case in Texas,

6

Sid Richardson Oil and Gas Company, in which the federal

7

judge said the same thing, that when the money goes out it

8

will go out with the same rate of interest.

9

Here I think the Court has two options on this

10

determination of other states' law.

11

the Kansas decision which is made in good faith.

12

is exactly like state law turns out to be two or three years

13

later or a year or two later probably doesn't happen very

14

often, even when a federal court predicts what a state court

IS

is going to decide, or a federal court predicts what another

16

-- a neighboring state court will decide.

17

One would be to affirm
whether it

The other option, I think, would be to find that

18

the Kansas determination was erroneous, althouqh I submit

19

by a very small amount, and enter judgment for interest in

20

accord with the Oklahoma statute, the Texas Cavnar rule

21

on prejudgment interest, and the Louisiana civil code

22

section.

23

If there are no other questions, I will finish.
