PROCEEDINGS
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

3

morning in No.87-16, Richard D. Shapiro versus the Kentucky Bar

4

Association.

Mr. Cox, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY DONALD L. COX, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

7

MR. COX:

8

This is the third case in six years which has come to

9

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:

this Court from the various district courts and has involved

10

absolute bans on various forms of written advertising by

11

attorneys.

12

they go into the Zauderer case and now in the Shapiro case.

In each of those cases, and they begin with R.M.J.;

And in each of those cases there is no record

13

®

We'll hear argument this

14
15

evidence below which would justify the absolute ban which the

16

supreme courts sought to impose.

Bar Association has advanced, and in which the various state

We had thought that this Court had made it absolutely

17
18

clear in the Zauderer decision when it said that an attorney

19

may not be disciplined for giving out truthful and non-

20

deceptive advice to specific clients about their legal rights.

21

We thought that that had settled the matter, but apparently it

22

has not; and we are here once again on another issue that has

23

been imposed, an absolute blanket ban on attorney advertising

24

speech.

25

The issue here today is something called targeted

Heritage

3
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

direct mail solicitation, which basically involves a situation

2

where an attorney sends out a written letter to a person whom

3

he has identified has having a specific legal problem; and that

4

letter contains some generalized legal advice similar to the

5

advice, perhaps, that was given in the Zauderer advertisements.

6
7
8
9

The Kentucky court has upheld the actual ban, and
that is why we are here today.
I would like to first go over just briefly the
situation in Kentucky, the specific, what I would call all-

10

encompassing rules regulating attorney advertizing, and then go

11

hopefully into the facts, and then into the legal argument.

12

Kentucky probably has as all-encompassing regulation

13

of attorney advertising as any state in this country.

14

Kentucky has done as gone through this Court's decisions, and

15

has seen in those decisions where the Court has indicated

16

various possible means of regulating attorney advertising.

17

Kentucky has, without exception, adopted all of those; and then

18

it's come up with some twists of its own.

19

What

As this Court suggested in R.M.J. and Central Hudson,

20

first off, Kentucky has a strict pre-submission process.

21

that process, advertisements of the type we're talking about

22

here, and almost all advertisements, except very limited

23

routine advertisements, are required to be pre-submitted to an

24

agency of the State Bar Association comprised of three lawyers

25

who are appointed by the State Bar Association.

4

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

Under

Those three lawyers review the advertisements;

1

2

they're given the power under the state regulation to conduct

3

investigations; to subpoena witnesses; and in addition, under

4

those regulations, are given the power to, in effect, edit the

5

advertisement by suggesting disclaimers; by suggesting changes

6

in the language.

7

And most importantly, I think from the standpoint of

8

this case, under those regulations, an attorney has to wait at

9

least 30 days before sending out any advertisement.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. COX:

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Cox?
Yes sir?
Let me look at this precise letter:

it

13

states, doesn't it, that "It has come to my attention that your

14

home is being foreclosed on."

15

certainly indicates familiarity with the precise piece of real

16

estate.

17

MR. COX:

Couldn't that be misleading?

It

Well, I think what it indicates, Justice

18

Blackmun, is that Mr. Shapiro had gone to the court records and

19

determined that, in fact, there was a foreclosure action

20

pending.

21

I don't think that it indicates any more than that.
And I think the important thing to note with respect

22

to this particular advertisement is that it was submitted to

23

three different state bodies, and in not one of those three,

24

did anybody say anything about it being false, misleading,

25

deceptive, or anything else.

Heritage

It was submitted to the state

5
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

advertising commission,who in the first instance, reviews all

2

advertisements.
It was submitted to the ethics committee; again, no sta

3
4

statement that there was any problem; it was submitted to the

5

state supreme court; the state supreme court did not in any way

6

base its decision -QUESTION:

7

But Mr. Cox, isn't it possible that all

8

three of those agencies, while it's clearly banned by an

9

existing rule, so we don't have to reach the question of

10

whether the particular advertisement is misleading.

11

MR. COX:

12

QUESTION:

That is a possibility.

But I do not --

And in fact, has anybody reviewed this

13

particular letter under the rule that was promulgated after the

14

letter was submitted?

15

MR. COX:

16

QUESTION:

17

But they didn't tell us anything about

whether it was misleading or not, did they?
QUESTION:

18
19

The Kentucky supreme court did.

The Kentucky supreme court simply said it

was banned.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. COX:

Banned by a broad regulation.
But they cited -- and I think it's

22

important that the cited in their decision the fact that it had

23

been reviewed by these lower court -- these lower bodies, and

24

there had been no finding that it was false, misleading, or

25

deceptive.

I think we can't --

2

QUESTION:

There is no finding that way, but there

was no finding the other way either.

3

MR. COX:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. COX:

That's correct.
Well, Mr. Cox — go ahead.
Would it not be more neutral if they said,

6

started off by saying, "Is your home being foreclosed?"

7

There again, there would be no connotation of

8

familiarity with this particular thing, and it would be much

9

more like the I.U.D. case that we had some time ago.

10

MR. COX:

But this letter is sent to people whose

11

homes are being foreclosed on.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. COX:

14

QUESTION:

Well —
I mean, that's
-- I mean, that would be a mistake.

15

That's what concerns me a little bit is there is a possibility

16

of it being misleading.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Cox, do you think that the state is

18

free to impose higher standards of truthfulness and honesty on

19

advertising like this than would be the case for selling soap

20

or vacuum cleaners, or something of that kind?

21

MR. COX:

It is my view that the false, misleading,

22

and deceptive rubric has to be judged in context; and we're

23

talking in the context of a letter coming from an attorney, so

24

obviously —

25

QUESTION:

Yes.

That's why I'm asking the question.

7

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

MR. COX:

-- and I am suggesting that under those

circumstances, a letter coming from an attorney might be judged
somewhat differently than a letter coming from the soap
company.
QUESTION:

So you would concede that higher standards

may be imposed?
MR. COX:

Somewhat higher standards, depending upon

what the context of the letter is.
QUESTION:

Do you think the state can ban telephone-

targeted advertising?
MR. COX:

It is my view that that is not the issue

before the Court here -QUESTION:
MR. COX:

Yes, I know that.
-- in this case.

But it is my view that

the Ohralik decision involved a specific set of facts in that
case, and telephone-targeted solicitation would depend on the
facts.

I do not believe, consistent with the First Amendment

overbreadth doctrine that Ohralik means all types of in-person
solicitation could be banned.

I think it depends on the facts

of the case, and that's what the Court has held in some of the
other decisions.

So I don't agree that there could be an

absolute ban on telephone solicitation.
But I don't believe the Court gets to that point in
this case.

Our concern here today is that we have yet another

example with a bar association without any fact-finding

8

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

whatsoever simply banning a written advertisement, and holding
in the Zauderer case that that can't occur.
You have to look at the advertisement and determine
whether it's false, misleading, or deceptive.

We have a three

attorney panel that does that in Kentucky; and it should be
left to them.
Let me point out one additional thing:

the Kentucky

rules make it very clear that even if there is a problem, as
Justice Blackmun suggested, maybe Mr. Shapiro should have said
"Is your home being foreclosed upon?"
If that's the kind of problem with the Shapiro
advertisements, first off, that's not a basis for banning all
targeted direct mail advertisements; and second, it's not a
basis for banning Mr. Shapiro's advertisement, because under
the specific rule, before the advertising commission takes the
-- goes to capital punishment, it's required, in essence, to
consider modifications of the language of the advertisement,
the insertion of disclaimers.
For example, to answer your concern, they might
suggest a disclaimer that not all people's homes have been
foreclosed upon.

I mean, I can't --

QUESTION:

I would think that you have that he has

amended, saying "Is your home subject to foreclosure," that
would be banned under this rule?
MR. COX:

Yes, that would be a flat ban.

Heritage

9
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

Yes, the

rule -- yes, Justice White, the rule bans anything you say in

2

writing that's in the mail targeted to a person that you know

3

has a specific legal problem.

4

place, which I thought was removed in the Zauderer decision.
QUESTION:

5
6

Is the Kentucky rule based on an American

Bar Association suggested rule?

7

MR. COX:

8

QUESTION:

9

So you still have the ban in

Rule 7.3.
Did the ABA in working on its rule, and

ultimately promulgating, did it make any factual inquiries that

10

MR. COX:

11

9

Those have not been brought to my

12

attention.

13

7.3, one of the prime reasons why the ABA rejected the pre-

14

submission process appeared to have been the argument there

15

that some were saying, "Well, wouldn't pre-submission address

16

these problems?"

17

too difficult — the agencies would be too busy and they

18

wouldn't be able to go through these advertisments.

19

certainly not been the experience in Kentucky.

20

The kinds of factual -- in the comments to Rule

And the ABA's comments say,

"Well no, it's

That's

This commission's been around for six years; and in

21

their decision, now -- we've got to look at the advertising

22

commission of the Kentucky Bar Association.

23

recommended that the Kentucky Bar Association delete this rule

24

they were enforcing because they felt it was unconstitutional

25

under Zauderer; that, incidentally, that was the position of

They believed and

10

Heritage

1

•

2

the American Bar Association advertising commission; and the
American Bar Association ethics commission; and the Department

3

of Justice anti-trust division; and the Federal Trade

4

Commission.
So all of the agencies that have looked at this,

5
6

except the trade associations, the lawyer trade associations,

7

have in essence come to the conclusion that this is unworkable.

8

And unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

9
10

it's unworkable, or that, in their view, it's unconstitutional

11

because of our decisions?

12

^

Well, do they come to the conclusion that

MR. COX:

They came -- the advertising commission, I

13

think, had two concerns.

14

- remember, they were the people who administer this on a day-

15

to-day basis -- it seems to me if they had a concern about the

16

workability of the system, they would have expressed it.

17

The Kentucky advertising commission -

But I will concede that, for the most part, those

18

administrative agencies who looked at the issue have emphasized

19

more this Court's what I think is clear holding in the Zauderer

20

decision.

21

Yes, that is correct.
But the important point is that the people who would

22

be administering this have expressed no fact finding of any

23

problem at all.

24

case, the amici have come into this Court and in their briefs,

25

I think they concede that this factual vacuum that we're acting

The only fact finding that we've had in this

11

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

•

1

on a naked record; and so they have attempted to after-the-fact

2

supply a factual basis for this rule which is unsupported in

3

the record; and what they did is they went out and conducted

4

what I can only call a "jack-leg survey."

5

results of that survey to this Court.
The survey was actually conducted after this Court

6
7

granted certiorari.

8

important nugget in the survey of the Florida Bar Association.

9

And that nugget, I think really addresses the concerns that

But there's a nugget -- there's a real

10

everybody has, and that is, what impact do these direct-mail

11

advertisments have on the recipients?

12

^

And presented the

And here's this one nugget, virtually -- this is the

13

Florida Bar Association in their survey, virtually no one

14

believes -- and these are the recipients now, virtually no one

15

believes that direct mail advertisments they received from an

16

attorney was either intimidating or frightening, or confusing.
So the only evidence we have in this case before you,

17
18

is that.

There is just no other evidence, and I think the

19

Kentucky supreme court really realized that because in their

20

decision they didn't purport to rely on evidence.

21

decision was based on the following:

22

serious potential, now -- that these kinds of advertisments

23

have for the kinds of harm that this Court has said could be

24

the basis for a ban, they said it was entirely possible that

25

these harms would result; and they said it was full of "the

the serious potential -

12

Heritage

Their

possibilities.
Well, I think, you know, it's possible the roof could
fall here, but it's not the basis for our leaving the court
room.

And I don't think the possibility that someone may be

overreached, or may be misled, is the basis for a blanket ban.
If there is a problem with an advertisement, we —
QUESTION:

So you say the possibility of being

overreached isn't a basis for a blanket — supposing there were
evidence showing that something more than a possibility -- a
reasonable probability or something like that?

Would you still

say no blanket ban?
MR. COX:

I would say that, as to written

advertisments, you have to look at each individual
advertisement.

I do not conceded as a matter of fact or law,

that written advertisments are inherently deceptive by their
very nature.
Nor do I concede as a matter of fact or law that
letters sent out to people who have legal problems, are
inherently deceptive.
I think what this Court has said in its prior
opinions is,

"Let's look at them on a case-by-case basis."

QUESTION:

Supposing the Florida survey that you

refer to, which you say was taken after-the-fact and wasn't the
base -- and really can't be the -- supposing it had shown that,
you know, 30 percent of the people felt intimidated or misled,

Heritage

13
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

and that had been the basis for Kentucky's rule — would you

2

say that the result was still the same?
MR. COX:

3

No.

I don't believe that we should get

4

into the least common denominator situation.

5

that doing a survey -- how would you survey about

6

advertisments, written advertisements in general?
QUESTION:

7
8

MR. COX:

So

No.

No, I think it is useful on the other

side.
QUESTION:

11

12

You regard it as "nugget," I thought?

I thought perhaps you thought it was useful?

9
10

I don't concede

But I mean, what if it had come out the

other way?
MR. COX:

13

I think if it had come out the other way,

14

then we'd be in a problem.

But it says, "virtually no one."

15

So if 99 percent of the Florida people had said they felt

16

intimidated, overreached, and whatever, then maybe we'd have a

17

problem.

18

But I don't believe that's even a remote possibility.

19

I don't think that there's any way that you can design a survey

20

which would survey for the -- to cover all possible written

21

advertisments.

22

I just don't think that's the case.

Our view is that, consistent with Zauderer; it's

23

right there in writing, you have to look at each advertisement

24

individually, and we've got a perfect process.

25

QUESTION:

Well, I think that if you take it you

think that some targeted mailings could be forbidden?

MR. COX:

If on their face are false, misleading, and

deceptive.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. COX:

6

QUESTION:

Yes .
And some can't.

Some cannot be.

So, if that's the case, what is the

7

justification for declaring this rule invalid on its face?

8

That's what you asked, isn't it?

9

MR. COX:

Well, I think, well, as the first matter I

10

asked that Mr. Shapiro be able to be permitted to send out this

11

letter, but yes.

12

QUESTION:

All right, then, all you're really asking

13

is that, as applied to your case, this rule is

14

unconstitutional?

MR. COX:

QUESTION:

Did it?

I thought it struck it down.
Oh, all right.
I believe it struck it down, although I

Well, I was going to ask next, did the

Kentucky supreme court say why they struck that one down?
MR. COX:

They said why, but I think they misspoke.

13

They said they were striking it down in view of Zauderer.

14

think what they really meant was they were striking it down in

15

view of Primus, because the old rule had prohibited targeted

16

direct mail soliciting for both pecuniary and non-pecuniary

17

gain — that's Primus on all fours.

18

QUESTION:

I

In Primus.

But the rule you have brought before us

19

now, as I understand it, is a precise counterpart of the ABA

20

rule, is it not?

21

MR. COX:

Yes sir.

And it is precisely the same --

22

it may be more severe than the old Kentucky rule -- the only

23

difference between this rule and the old Kentucky rule, is that

24

the old Kentucky rule, a part of it was unconstitutional under

25

Primus, but as applied to the facts of this case, there is no

difference between the application of 7.3 and the application

2

of the old Kentucky rule.

3
4
5

Well, as to their reasons for striking

down the first rule, do you suggest they just misspoke?
MR. COX:

I believe they struck it down on purpose

6

because they deleted -- they put in a pecuniary gain

7

requirement.

8

would be Primus.

The reason they looked -- you're the one

-- it was the -- it was Mr. Shapiro that brought the Zauderer

case before them, wasn't it?

15

MR. COX:

Yes sir.

The Zauderer, I mean, Zauderer

16

says, I mean, I just don't see how it can be any clearer.

17

Zauderer says that an attorney may not be disciplined for

regarding the legal rights of potential clients.

And in that quote I just

QUESTION:

Mr. Cox, how many states today do you

think have this flat ban on targeted direct mail?
MR. COX:

It's reported in our brief -- and our

numbers differ from the numbers that they reported, but it's

10

around perhaps half.

11

out of the ABA service on attorney advertising, and so it's a

12

little clearer, but there is a significant number that do have

13

the ban, and I think most of it is due to the fact that it's

14

contained in the ABA rules.

I'm not sure -- we had gotten our figures

So whether it — the question is, is this case like

16

I think it's clearly like Zauderer

We have a letter there which says right on its

face, this is an advertisement.

it's been pre-screened; everything's been checked out on it.
QUESTION:

Well, I'm still a little puzzled about

what you say, "everything's been checked out," because I'm not
sure it was checked out in this case; and with respect to this
letter, and you're really arguing that you want us to approve
this particular letter — you're not asking for the general ban
to be struck down?
MR. COX:

I would like -- I understand the

overbreadth doctrine and its limited application in commercial
speech, but for the future of attorney advertising, the ban
ought to be struck down.

QUESTION:

I don't believe that that's misleading.
You don't think it's a close question that

we might want to get the views of some state bar association,
or some state authorities on before we say that it isn't?
MR. COX:

It is my view that, if you -- another

question that could be asked — and I don't want to answer the
question with a question; but shouldn't you say that -- ask,
whether the people in there had been the district 180 days or
whatever that number is for bankruptcy, and -QUESTION:

No, no, you miss my point:

I'm saying

bankruptcy is not as attractive to many people as a federal law
that enables them to tell their creditors to stop.
MR. COX:

And it's my view that there's -- that

that's not demonstrably misleading.

If you require every nit

of the law to be set forth in every advertisement, then we
won't have effective advertisments.
QUESTION:

I don't think calling bankruptcy

"bankruptcy" is every nit of the law.
MR. COX:

Well, we also believe that eliminating the

rule will provide a -- there are many good benefits from having
this kind of advertising.

You remember, we're talking about an

advertising that has been pre-reviewed by a state regulatory
agency that has been edited and will be sent out only after
extensive bar association review.
Is it better for people to get legal advice on that

out about the availability of legal services under those

circumstances, or from their next-door-neighbor; or in a bar;

5

We're talking about a situation where we're making

legal advice and advertising legal services that are clearly

7

regulated by the bar association.

8

10
11

The other alternatives provide information about
lawyers under situations which are much less likely to be
truthful and non-deceptive.
QUESTION:

We certainly don't know in this case that

12

Kentucky supreme court said this targeted solicitation is, has

13

to be, banned under our rule, even though it is not deceptive,

14

and even though it is truthful, and even though it is not

15

misleading?

16

MR. COX:

They didn't say that.

All they said was

17

that they recognized that that finding that there was no

18

finding to that effect in the administrative agencies below,

19

and then they dropped it.

20

QUESTION:

Now, let's assume a court having read the

21

cases that you brought before them, that no advertising by a

22

lawyer can be banned; no advertising like this can be banned

23

unless it's false, misleading, as long as it 's truthful; and

24

then it just says, "We do not approve this letter."

MR. COX:

Without saying why?

(202) 628-4888

QUESTION:

Yes.

Here's a court that knows the rule

and just says without any explanation, it just bans the letter.
Don't we assume that the court applied the rule; I mean, that
it knows is applicable and that it made, even though it didn't
say so, that it made the right findings?
MR. COX:

That would be my assumption.

decision — my time has expired.

clear that the supreme court banned this advertisement because
it didn't -- it was targeted direct mail advertisement.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY FRANK P. DOHENY, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. DOHENY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
There are two parts to the argument that I would like
to present, and the first is a jurisdictional one, which was

Heritage

25
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

touched on briefly by Justice Stevens in a question that he

2

asked.
Listening to Petitioner's argument, the Court might

3
4

conclude that what we had below was an attack on the entire

5

Kentucky advertising process. That is not the case.
Justice Stevens asked, "Was the letter reviewed after

6

7

Rule 7.3 was adopted?"

8

emphatically, "no."

And the answer to that is

The Kentucky supreme court opinion begins with these

9
10

words:

"This is a petition for review of supreme court rule

11

3.135, which has been interpreted by the advertising commission

12

to prohibit targeted direct mail advertising by lawyers."

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. DOHENY:

15

How does this disapprove this letter?
The Kentucky supreme court did not as

such disapprove this letter, Justice White.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. DOHENY:

Why it disapproved it?
It did neither.

What it said was that

18

Rule 3.135 pertaining to advertising, was too broad.

19

Petitioner asked below was that Rule 3.135 be deleted; and what

20

Kentucky did in referring to Zauderer three times in the

21

opinion of the court, was specifically said, "It is the

22

decision of this court that supreme court rule 3.135 be

23

deleted."

24
25

What

That is what they did.
QUESTION:

Well, do you think that Shapiro was free

to go ahead with his advertisement after the Kentucky supreme

MR. DOHENY:

QUESTION:

MR. DOHENY:

They did.
And what did they apply?
At the time they deleted Rule 3.135.

8

They adopted a new rule, ABA Model Rule 7.3, which prohibited,

9

QUESTION:

Well, the claim is that Kentucky is not

11

entitled under the First Amendment to require this particular

12

letter.

13

MR. DOHENY:

14

QUESTION:

i5

MR. DOHENY:

And that claim —
And that claim rejects it.
If the Court please, I believe that

16

claim was raised for the first time in this Court and that is

17

the heart of our jurisdictional argument; that what Petitioner

18

attacked in the trial court was Rule 3.135, which he asked be

19

deleted.

20

QUESTION:

Well, what he said, what he claimed was,

21

that he is entitled to publish this -- to mail, this

22

advertisement; he's entitled to under the First Amendment.

23

That's his claim.

No, Justice White, I do not.

As against any Kentucky rule.

MR. DOHENY:

And that gets to the substantive issue,

Justice White, as to whether Kentucky can constitutionally ban

27
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

the letter as proposed by Shapiro.

2

is again emphatically "Yes, it can be banned."

3

5

QUESTION:

I think the answer to that

Isn't that the issue before us?

And isn't

it properly before us?
MR. DOHENY:

I think the issue is not properly before

6

you, Justice White, because it was not raised in the Kentucky

7

supreme court.

8

was a challenge to Rule 3.135.

9

What was raised in the Kentucky supreme court

When the court adopted Model Rule 7.3, Petitioner had

10

the right to seek rehearing or modification; or to begin a new

11

proceeding.

12

from this Court.

13

He did none of those.

He simply sought certiorari

So we contend that by his failure to raise that issue

14

in the Kentucky courts, he has deprived this Court of

15

jurisdiction.

16

QUESTION:

But that seems rather strained to me,

17

because he never knew about Rule 7.3 until the supreme court of

18

Kentucky adopted it.

19

rule it was attacking, and during the course of the litigation,

20

the authority -- the body with the authority to do so says,

21

"Well, now this rule you're attacking is no longer in effect;

22

but a new rule is," and he has the same complaint about that,

23

doesn't strike you as rather highly a technical a thing to have

24

to go back and start all over?

25

MR. DOHENY:

It did, did it not?

QUESTION:

MR. DOHENY:

17

MR. DOHENY:

QUESTION:

It disapproved it, did it not?

of the new rule?

18

20

Did the Kentucky supreme court disapprove

Yes.
Well then, why is the case here?

That's

what he's bringing here.
MR. DOHENY:

Well, our position is that that new rule

22

should have first been challenged in the Kentucky supreme court

23

rather than before this Court.

24

QUESTION:

25

Well, what chance do you think a challenge

would have had in the Kentucky supreme court after that court

Heritage

29
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

had adopted the rule?

2

QUESTION:

And applied it?

3

QUESTION:

And applied it to this case?

4

MR. DOHENY:

I can't get inside the mind of the

5

Kentucky supreme court, but they, like other courts, are

6

willing to listen and be educated; and if there was a challenge

7

to the new rule, I think they would apply their wisdom and

8

experience to it; and the facts that are presented to that

9

court about the rule.
QUESTION:

10

Mr. Doheny, it would be a different

11

question if all the Kentucky Supreme Court did was to say,

12

"You're right, the old rule is no good; we're adopting a new

13

rule. "

14

But it didn't just do that.

You say that it went

15

further, and in that situation, I can understand why you would

16

say you would have to go back and see whether, under state law,

17

this thing is banned under the new rule.
But the court didn't stop there.

18

It said,

"We're

19

adopting this new rule and your letter is banned under the new

20

rule. "

21

MR. DOHENY:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

Well, perhaps I —
Did it say that or not?

If it didn't say

that, you have a different case.
MR. DOHENY:

Well, perhaps I overstated it, Mr.

Justice Scalia, because it does not say in the opinion that

30

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

they made a finding with respect to this letter.

They simply

say that, with respect to Rule 7.3, this is an appropriate rule
which we now adopt as the law of this government.
QUESTION:

Well, your response to one of the other

Justice' questions was that, indeed, there has been a
determination that this letter is no good.
Now you're saying there has not been?
MR. DOHENY:

I believe I was in error when I said,

that, Justice.
QUESTION:

I don't think so.

The next sentence says,

"We affirm the decision of the ethics committee to deny the
request."

And the request is to mail out this letter.
So I think they not only set out the appropriate rule

we should adopt as the law in the case, but they then go on and
affirm the ruling.
And may I ask just one other procedural question?
MR. DOHENY:

Sure.

MR. DOHENY:
QUESTION:

We did make it late.
Mr. Doheny, it strikes me you'd be well-

advised to spend time on the merits of the case, because I
think your jurisdiction argument may be unpersuasive.
And on the merits, I'm wondering whether on the new
rule, you would take the position that an advertisement like
this, if it were deemed not misleading, could be published in
the newspaper?

Then copies of the ad could go directly to the

targeted recipients?
MR. DOHENY:

I think that,

if the substance of the

letter, Justice O'Connor, were deemed to be not misleading,
without question, in Kentucky, it would appear in a newspaper.
We have broad rules.
QUESTION:

Yes, and then could the newspaper ad be

mailed --- copies of it, to targeted recipients?
MR. DOHENY:

No, not under the new rule.

It could go

to a mass -- a group of persons under the rule, with whom -well, it could go to a group of persons as long as they were
not targeted.
Some of those people may, under the rule, need the
services that are offered.
QUESTION:

Well, under the First Amendment analysis,

why is it more of a concern by the state to protect the
recipients from opening up the ad in an envelope than from
reading it in their newspaper?

32
Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

9

has been touched upon by this Court; that it gets to the

3

ability of a trained advocate to persuade on a personal basis.

4

Admittedly, the letter is not as personal as the lawyer in your

5

home or in your hospital, as was banned in Ohralik.
Nevertheless, as the Florida court observed in

7

Stivers, a letter carries a special aura; and I would wager

8

that, if all of us returned to our homes tonight and had a

9

letter from a real estate agent or a lawyer, we'd open the

10
11

lawyer's letter first.
QUESTION:

If what's in the envelope is a copy of an

12

ad clipped out of a newspaper, why isn't that -- why shouldn't

13

it be treated like the newspaper?

14

MR. DOHENY:

The newspaper ad is a generalized

15

statement of advertising.

16

going to a group of people, as opposed to solicitation, which

17

goes to a more limited group.

18

And advertising is, by definition,

facing foreclosure, or being the victim of an automobile

general nature of the advertisement as opposed to the in-person

24

or the letter solicitation.

25

I think that the distinction is that it

You have to mail it to somebody.
You could mail it generally to those who

QUESTION:

It's a rather odd First Amendment doctrine

21

that we forbid ads only when they're targeted at people that

are interested in them, which is the purport of your argument

23

MR. DOHENY:

I'm trying, and am prepared to, draw a

24

distinction between advertising on the one hand; and again,

25

solicitation on the other.

34

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

I suggest respectfully that there is a fundamental

1
2

difference, and what Mr. Shapiro chose to do here is

3

solicitation, to a specific individual, which I believe a state

4

can, under the rulings of this Court in Qhralik properly

5

prohibit because of the ability of the lawyer to overreach.

7

QUESTION:

MR. DOHENY:

8
9

So basically, you're saying you can't be

Kennedy.

I wouldn't word it that way, Justice

I would say that some of the reasons against

10

solicitations are -- there are numerous ones.

We don't know if

11

the person has a viable case; we don't know if the recipient

12

has retained a lawyer; we don't know the mental or emotional

13

state of the recipient when the solicitation arrives there.

14

I think there are valid reasons that can result in

15

the prohibition against solicitation, and the possibility or

16

probability, whichever term you choose to use, of overreaching,

17

is far greater on a specific communication than it is in a

18

newspaper or a television advertisement, which you are free to

19

reject rather easily.
