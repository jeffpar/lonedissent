ORAL ARGUMENT OF GLEN D. NAGER

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. NAGER:

8

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case comes to the Court on a writ of certiorari

10
11

from the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

12

That Court held that the Postal Service must comply with an

13

arbitration award that orders to reinstate to a letter carrier

14

position an individual who has been criminally convicted of

15

failing to deliver over 3500 pieces of mail, and who an

16

arbitrator found posed a risk of again delaying the mail in the

17

future.

18

We have sought review by this Court, because we

19

believe that the Postal Service cannot comply with the decision

20

below without defaulting upon its statutory obligations to

21

ensure that the mail is reliability delivered.

22

The facts of the case are relatively simple.

23

of 1984, postal inspectors made a lawful search of the personal

24

automobile of the Grievant in this case, Mr. Edward Hyde.

25

the course of that search, they found over 3500 pieces of mail

In

Some of the mail contained United

2

States Treasury checks, and some of those checks were dated

3

April 1, 1983 indicating that the mail had been delayed, some

4

of the pieces of the mail had been delayed at least a year and

5

a half.
The Postal Service immediately had Mr. Hyde arrested,

and charged him with unlawful possession and unlawful delay of

the mails in violation of 18 U.S.C. -QUESTION:

May I ask you a factual question,

Mr. Nager.
How much mail would he normally carry?

11

This is not a

12

year and a half's accumulation of mail obviously, 3500 pieces.

13

Would that be a couple of day's mail?

14

MR. NAGER:

Justice Stevens, I really do not know the

15

answer to that.

His route was in Long Island, New York, in

16

Jericho, New York, and I really do not know how many houses

MR. NAGER:

MR. NAGER:

junk mail.
The Postal Service charged Mr. Hyde with unlawful

2
3

possession of the mail and unlawful delay of the mail.

And he

4

pled guilty to the latter offense, and was sentenced to

5

eighteen months probation, a condition of which that he enter a

6

complete rehabilitation program for compulsive gamblers.
Now because of his criminal dereliction of duties,

7

8

the Postal Service sought to discharge Mr. Hyde.

The

9

Respondent, the National Association of Letter Carriers, filed

10

a grievance on Mr. Hyde's behalf under the collective

11

bargaining agreement that the Postal Service and the Letter

12

Carriers have entered into.
And they argue that the Postal Service was without

13
14

just cause to discharge Mr. Hyde, and that he should be

15

reinstated to his letter carrier position.
QUESTION:

16

Mr. Nager, I take it that there has been a

17

stay entered, so that this employee has not been back on the

18

job?

19

MR. NAGER:

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

The Solicitor

20

General sought a stay from the Chief Justice of the

21

D.C. Circuit's mandate.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

And the case is not moot, because the

employee still wants to return to being a letter carrier?
MR. NAGER:

Yes, that is right.

am sure that the Union would file a grievance seeking back pay

complying with the arbitration order.
QUESTION:

Mr. Nager, what is the connection between

compulsive gambling on the one hand and not delivering mail on
the other?
MR. NAGER::
reflect it.

Justice Blackmun, the record does not

I have speculated on it.

The arbitrator found

that his failure to deliver the mail was attributable to his
compulsive gambling problem.

He did not say how it led to his

failure to deliver the mail.

And the Postal Service's

collective bargaining agreement with the Letter Carriers does
not provide and in fact prohibits use of transcripts during the
arbitral proceeding.

So there is no record of testimony on

that point.
QUESTION:

It is a little easier to understand if it

was alcoholism.
There is no accusation here and certainly no
conviction of stealing government checks, is there?
MR. NAGER:

No.

He pled guilty to unlawful delay.

He was charged with unlawful possession, but he was not charged
with stealing the mail.
An arbitrator convened a hearing with respect to the
grievance, and ruled in Respondent's favor for Mr. Hyde.

The

arbitrator found that Mr. Hyde had in fact unlawfully delayed
the mails, but he also found that it was attributable to what

he characterized as the Grievant's mental disease, his

affliction for compulsive gambling.
He thus saw his own task as what he termed balancing

the needs of society, the needs of the mentally ill, and the

5

needs of the employee.

"The

He then found that he did not know what the future

And he identified the differentiating

prospects of rehabilitation were for Mr. Hyde.

And indeed,

10

this was a tough decision for him, because he saw that there

11

was a threat of recurrence of the misconduct.
But in that balance where there was a possibility of

12

13

rehabilitation, he concluded that this is not a risk free

14

And thus, it is the Postal Service and the

QUESTION:

Mr. Nager, in this case, there is a

19

statute that provides that delivery of the mail is the highest

20

priority of the Postal Service.

21

MR. NAGER:

22

QUESTION:

That is correct.
On the other hand, there are statutes

23

saying that the Postal Service will engage in collective

24

bargaining, and there are statutes reflecting that

25

rehabilitation is also appropriate for the employer to

Heritage

7
Reporting Corporation

consider.

2

Now is it only where there is a statute that says

3

that one has the highest priority that it would be justifiable

4

then to rely on that as the public policy?

5

MR. NAGER:

I think that it is clearly the case where

6

Congress has indicated what the highest priority is among

7

several competing statutes.

8

indicated has the highest priority should prevail.

9

QUESTION:
MR. NAGER:

10

That the statute Congress has

And if there were not such language?
If there were not such language, I think

11

that the Court would, as it does in every case in which it is

12

faced with statutes.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. NAGER:

With competing public policies?
Correct.

In cases in which there were

15

competing public policies, the Court would have to reconcile

16

those statutes, as it does in any case where there are statutes

17

that point in different directions.

18

this case.

19
20

QUESTION:

That, of course, is not

But Mr. Nager, labor arbitration has a

high priority, too, does it not?
MR. NAGER:

21

It does, Justice Brennan.

And we have

22

tried to make it as clear as we can in our brief that we are

23

not seeking in any way to destabilize the labor-arbitration

QUESTION:

we believe that the --

6

QUESTION:

It has been recognized, but to be kept in

7

very narrow limits, is it not?

8

MR. NAGER:

9
10

And

That is correct.

But let me address why

it is so important that the Court not only recognize that it
pay attention to the public policy exception.
The argument in this case is that somehow allowing a

11
12

public law to trump an arbitration decision would somehow

13

destabilize the arbitration process.

14

true.

But quite the opposite is

15

The Court has to remember how collective bargaining

16

agreements are negotiated, and how arbitration provisions get

17

put into collective bargaining agreements.

18

Typically, in a collective bargaining context, an

19

employer and a union will have approximately ninety days upon

20

which to agree.

21

give notice ninety days before the expiration of the agreement.

22

And the union will come forward with a series of demands on

23

numerous topics that they would like the employer to agree to.

24
25

If an agreement is about to expire, they will

And the employer will respond to those demands.

And

over the course of ninety days, they will deal with provisions

Heritage

9
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

dealing with the various economics of their relationships, and

2

the various work rules that govern their relationships.

3

Every one of those proposals can and oftentimes do

4

have legal ambiguities in them.

5

that if the parties had to resolve every legal ambiguity, just

6

as they had to resolve every contractual ambiguity, before they

7

entered into the contract, they would never be able to enter

8

into a contract in the first place.

9

And the fact of the matter is

The public policy exception simply greases the wheel,

so to speak, of the collective bargaining process.

14

thinks would put them in violation of public law, if they had

16

and to seek to have that provision declared unlawful.

17

It allows

decision in this case.

The real question is does the public policy

MR. NAGER:

5

I think that is correct, Justice White,

6

and let me turn to that.

7

Justice Brennan's question about why the public policy

8

exception existed and how broad or narrow it should be.
QUESTION:

9

I was just trying to address

Let me ask before you get to that, because

10

this is brought to my mind by your reference to the Kaiser

11

case.
Do you dispute the fact that if we did not have a

12
13

public policy problem in the case, that the arbitrator's award

14

would be one that would be a permissible reading of the

15

collective bargaining agreement?

16

MR. NAGER:

We have not disputed that in this case.

17

QUESTION:

So the case that we have to decide is one

18

in which we could assume arguendo that the parties had spelled

19

out that if this particular problem should arise in the future,

20

that this solution will be given, that this will be the

21

solution.

22

against the public policy.

23

Then we say would that contractual provision be

MR. NAGER:

That is correct.

24

the case that way.

25

agreed to this provision.

And we tried to brief

We said by hypothesis we assume and we have
And the question is whether or not

11

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

2

our statutory obligations preclude us from complying with it.
And the reason why I say that that hypothesis is a

3

realistic one is not just because of the contract and the

4

reasonableness or unreasonableness of the arbitrator's award,

5

but because that is the nature of collective bargaining and the

6

types of situations that employers and unions find themselves

7

in having to agree to ambiguous or unambiguous provisions on

8

the recognition that either one of them can subsequently go to

9

court and point out that that provision is inconsistent with

10

11
12

public law.
Because is may not be important to the employer, even
if it is illegal.

And it may be very important to the union.

3

And the employer does not want to end up having a strike over

4

whether or not the provision is legal or illegal.

QUESTION:

Do I understand from what you say that it

would have been illegal for the Postal Department to have
complied with this arbitration award?
MR. NAGER:

That is absolutely correct,

Justice White, and let me turn to why that is the case.
QUESTION:

Before you do, it really might help both

21

the employer and the union in those situations as well as help

are not urging us that just because employers typically throw

3

in the towel and say, well, I will fight that when it comes,

4

that we have to decide these things case by case forever?

MR. NAGER:

QUESTION:

very much like this.

MR. NAGER:

No.
I thought that we just had a case that is

But to answer your question, we do

think that clearer roles would be helpful to everyone.

is a well defined and dominant public policy in existing law

13

and legal precedent which is the standard that the Court used

in Misco.

conflicts with that well defined and dominant public policy,

18

We are

And if the arbitration award compromises or

That is the legal standard

The question in this case, as Justice White has

19

asked, is what is the public policy and how does it conflict.

20

And the public policy in this case, we would submit, which the

21

Respondents have conceded, is the public's interest and

22

Congress' mandate that the mails be maintained, secure, and

23

reliably delivered.

24
25

I think that it goes without saying that it is a
fundamental premise of our entire economic and political system

13

Heritage

Reporting

(202) 628-4888

that the mails will be reliably and securely delivered.

2

right to establish a post office and maintain it is recognized

in the Constitution.

And in recognition of that public interest, Congress

has enacted a series of statutes, the first of which grants a

that the Postal Service shall ensure the prompt, reliable, and

policy which it does, but also the dominance and definition

2

that this Court in Grace and Misco said was necessary.
The definition and the dominance which comes from

Section 410(b) and from 18 U.S.C. 1701, which 410(b) makes

5

applicable to the Postal Service in conjunction with 101(a)

6

mandates that the Postal Service preserve the security and

7

sanctity of the mails in preventing the kinds of actions by its

own employers that Mr. Hyde engaged in in this case in the

unlawful delay of the mail. We have not argued that any award

which the Postal Service thinks isolated and by itself

11

might —
OUI'ST ION:

12

But how about an employee who is just

13

slow, just not very efficient; he did not steal the mail, but

14

the employee just moved slowly?
MR. NAGER:

15

That is an act of misfeasance by the

16

employee, but it is not an act of statutory malfeasance.

17

not something that we read the statute as prohibiting the

18

Postal Service from tolerating.

25

QUESTION:

It is

We do read the statute as

Well, the Court of Appeals certainly did

not think that it violated any statute.
MR. NAGER:

The Postal Service looked at the statute

Heritage

15
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

and said that in order — the Court of Appeals said in order

2

for us to agree not to enforce this arbitration award that we

3

have to find a provision in the statute which says in its terms

4

that the Postal Service cannot employ an individual who has

5

committed this act or who presents a threat to the

6

Postal Service.
But that specificity has never been required by this

7

8

Court.

It was not required by the Court, for example, in

9

Hurd v. Hodge where the Court read the equal protection.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. NAGER:

12

It was not required in Misco either.
It was not required in Misco.

It was not

QUESTION:

been illegal, illegal for the Postal Service to rehire this

fellow.

17
18

19
20

MR. NAGER:

That is how we read our own statutory

obligations, to preclude us from employing an individual.
QUESTION:

The Court of Appeals certainly rejected

that notion, I think.
MR. NAGER:

Well, it did, we think incorrectly.

But

21

the reason that it did was that it said that there has to be

22

specific statutory language that in terms precludes the

23

reinstatement of this individual.

required in order to refuse to enforce an arbitration award

25

that degree of specificity in statutory language.

But this Court has never

QUESTION:

1

Maybe not, but have we not required a

2

judgment on the part of the person who has been given that call

3

that is so outrageous that no reasonable person could come to

4

it.

5

I mean are you arguing that the arbitrator could not

6

possibly have thought that the chances of rehabilitation

7

outweighed the chances of any impairment?

8
9

MR. NAGER:

No, we are not arguing that at all.

What

we are arguing is that the letter carrier position in the

10

Postal Service is not a testing ground for the arbitrator's

11

judgments about whether or not Mr. Hyde will eventually become

12

fully rehabilitated.

13

QUESTION:

What is the rule then, that whenever any

14

Postal Service employee has committed a crime involving the

15

mails that he must be dismissed?

16

MR. NAGER:

Unless the arbitrator makes a factual

17

finding based on the evidence presented at the arbitration

18

hearing that he finds that there is not a risk that the

19

misconduct will occur again in the future.

20
21

22

QUESTION:

No risk, zero risk.

You cannot make that

finding for any postal employee.
MR. NAGER:

When I say no risk, that he does not find

23

on the basis of the facts before him that there is a undue risk

24

that that misconduct will occur again in the future.

17

Heritage

undue in the sense of the policy of trying to rehabilitate

people?
MR. NAGER:

3

What the arbitrator said in this case was

4

that he found the risk.

5

you keep him off employment for another sixty days and he shows

6

some initial commitment to rehabilitating himself that you

7

should assume the risk that he will commit misconduct in the

future.

What he said is, well, I think that if

established clinical evidence of his recovery and he has

abstained from drinking for two years.

That is the kind of evidence and finding that we are

suggesting that the arbitrator should be required to make a

QUESTION:

Here the arbitrator's findings, if I

remember correctly, were to the effect that the arbitrator is

not totally persuaded that the employee presently has the

And the arbitrator is not able to foretell what the future

prospects of his rehabilitation may yield.

those findings are not sufficient.
MR. NAGER:

That is correct.

Those findings

indicated, the first one that you read about, that he was not

totally persuaded that Mr. Hyde has the present emotional

14

stability to perform the job, is why he did not put Mr. Hyde

back in initially.

He postponed it for sixty days.

And when they got to arbitration, the arbitrator

QUESTION:

I thought that you agreed that the

arbitrator would make decisions like this.
MR. NAGER:

We have agreed that the arbitrator would

11

make the decision as to whether or not there is a future risk.

12

Once he defines what he believes the future risk to be, then we

13

say that is up to the Postal Service in the first instance, but

14

ultimately to the courts, as this Court said in Misco and

15

W.R. Grace, as to whether or not the risk is undue.

QUESTION:

whether there was cause for the discharge.

18

MR. NAGER:

QUESTION:

That is not only making these findings,

but construing the word cause in the contract.

MR. NAGER:

That is correct.
And that is his job, and he did it.
That is correct, he did.

disputing that he misinterpreted the contract.

saying is that he found that there was a risk, and he also

What we are

1

found that there were offsetting mitigating factors.

He found

2

the fact that Mr. Hyde's father had died the year before, the

3

fact that his brother had come close to nearly dying, the fact

4

that he had cancer the year before, and above all else he found

5

that there was compulsive gambling.

6

But if the risk that he found is one that the Postal

7

Service is statutorily not permitted to incur which is what we

8

suggest here, then we suggest that it is up to a court to

vacate that arbitration award, even though the arbitrator

correctly interpreted the contract.

14

MR. NAGER:

If he had just been a negligent or lousy

Postal Service employee, he would not have met what we consider

16

to be the threshold standard for these cases, that he had

The statute also provides that collective bargaining

But I would submit that if anything that those

sentences which I think are the foundation of the government's

entire case strengthen the argument for enforcing the award.

14

Because what they show is that this arbitrator recognized the

15

problem and thought about it before he made his decision.

16

And I think that it is important if we are really

.17

going to focus on exactly what the arbitrator said to emphasize

18

that those sentences which establish that he cannot foretell

the future occur essentially in the middle of the opinion,

20

which consists of a general discussion of the evidence and the

21

issue before him.

22

The arbitrator's actual conclusions are on the last

And they consist first of a reference to

those instances in which the judiciary can bring to bear its

7

judgment.
QUESTION:

8
9

And that might mean that in the face of such

Well, let me respond to that question,

which I think goes to the heart of the case in this manner.

If

10

we had a crystal ball that we could peer into and we could see

11

that if Hyde were placed back on the job that a significant

12

amount of mail would be placed in the trunk of his car or

13

otherwise mishandled, yes, this award would violate public

14

policy.

15

The problem is that obviously we cannot foretell the

16

future, which is exactly what the arbitrator recognized.

17

Because we are dealing with uncertainty, the question is

18

whether the statute prohibits the employment of individuals who

19

may be a greater risk than the average employee, or in this

20

case the next employee hired off the employment register.

21

I do not think that that statute creates any

22

prohibition against the employment of high risk employees.

23

it could be argued, I suppose, as a matter of policy, that that

would be a good idea, to prohibit the employment of high risk

25

employees in the Postal Service.

But the fact is that Congress did not do that, and

1
2

that is absolutely clear from the legislative history.

3

Congress intended these matters to be decided by arbitrators.

4

Now frankly, I do not think that there is more

5

mishandling of the mail now than there was before the Postal

6

Reorganization Act when the Postal Service had the authority to

7

do exactly what it is seeking to do here, to walk away from an

8

arbitration award on the ground that it is inconsistent with

9

its statutory responsibilities.
Prior to

10
11

970, the old Post Office Department

pursuant to executive order had the authority to conduct

2

advisory arbitrations in its dealings with unions.

3

Department always retained the authority to overturn an award

14

But the

for whatever reason that it chose.

5

And what Congress found, and this was after extensive

6

studies of the Post Office Department, is that that system did

7

not work.

8

and tremendous frustration among the workers, which actually

It led to extremely low morale, low productivity,

19

culminated in

20

context in which Congress reorganized the Postal Service.

21

970 in a nationwide postal strike.

That was the

I think that it would be completely inconsistent with

22

congressional intent to attribute to Congress a purpose which

23

is not stated anywhere in the language of the statute to give

24

either management or the courts the authority to in effect

25

6

involved in reinstating an employee are too great.
QUESTION:

This public policy exception to the

enforcement of arbitration awards has existed for a long time.
You are not saying that it does not have any
application in Post Office matters, are you?
MR. SECULAR:

No, no.

We acknowledge that there is a

7

public policy doctrine in the Post Office.

But I think that

8

that touches on an important point which goes to the posture of

9

this appeal.

In Misco obviously, in the last footnote of the

10

Court's opinion, the Court left open the question of whether

11

the public policy doctrine is limited as the D.C. Circuit saw

12

it to violations of positive law.

13

Now the government has told us in its brief that that

14

question, which was left open in the footnote, is not raised

15

here, that the Court does not have to look at it.

16

sees this case as involving nothing more than a violation of

17

positive law.

18

Because it

So as I see this case, if there is no violation of

19

the statute per se, that is the end of this appeal.

20

no further inquiry into any possible common law theory, because

21

I do not see the government raising it.

QUESTION:

Suppose the arbitrator said that there was

That goes to how the statute is

I have suggested that even that statement would

not be the basis for finding a conflict between the statute and

2

the award.

3

available --

I am prepared in the limited time that I have

4

QUESTION:

But we interpret the statute, I take it?

5

MR. SECULAR:

That is right.

As a second position, I

6

would grant that if an arbitrator made a finding like that, a

7

public policy inquiry could be generated.
Now let me state before I go any further that if this

8
9

10

arbitrator had made that finding, I do not see how under our
contract that the employee would have been reinstated.
I think that it is entirely unfair to assume that

11

12

postal arbitrators exercising their functions under a statutory

13

scheme are putting back to work people who they find pose a

14

high risk to the security of the mail.

15

and there is no reason for it to happen under a just cause

16

provision.

17

That is not happening,

What should happen ideally if the Postal Service

18

feels that someone has a psychological problem and his

19

treatment is not sufficiently effective to reduce the risks of

20

further misconduct, that it should pose that question to the

21

arbitrator.

22

The regulations that we have cited, which are used

23

day to day in the Postal Service, permit the Postal Service to

24

have an employee examined to generate psychiatric reports.

25

Postal Service knows how to build a case that an employee is

38

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

The

1

unfit for further employment because of a psychological

2

impairment.
The Union can contest that.

3

And if the case is posed

4

to the arbitrator that way, the arbitrator will make findings.

5

One of the problems in this case is that the Postal Service

6

never really made that case here.

QUESTION:

MR. SECULAR:

I think that it can be in the Postal

Service.
QUESTION:

11
12

But you are saying that just cause will

But that is up to the arbitrator, I take

it?
MR. SECULAR:

Well, I think that the arbitrator will

14

not interpret or does not have to say that just cause means

15

that I will read the statute.

16

inquiry which is rather basic, whether an employee is going to

17

mishandle the mail, is essentially the same.

18

matter whether the arbitrator is deciding the case under a just

19

cause standard or under a statutory standard.

20

But I think that the factual

So it does not

If there is a difference, and if it is the kind of

21

difference which justifies overturning the award here, I am

22

afraid that you are setting the threshold of risk so low that

23

virtually any case involving misconduct can be brought into the

24

courts for a second look.

25

As I see it, what the Postal Service envisions is a

39

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

bifurcated process, whereby first the arbitrator plays the role

2

of something akin to an insurance actuary and figures out what

3

the statistical likelihood that this fellow will commit further

4

misconduct is.

5

judgment on whether that risk is acceptable.
QUESTION:

6

7

You do have a plea of guilty to a criminal

offense.
MR. SECULAR:

8

9

And then management and then the courts pass

That is right.

There is no question

that looking at this case retrospectively that Hyde committed

10

an offense involving the security of the mail.

11

that it is important to point out that that statute,

12

18 USC 1703, which applies exclusively to employees and

13

officers of the Postal Service, and they are the only ones who

14

can be convicted of that statute, does not provide for loss of

15

employment as a sanction.

16

But I think

So I think that the answer to that point is exactly

17

what then Circuit Judge Marshall said in Otis Elevator in 1963.

18

That the policy that is embodied in that criminal statute was

19

vindicated in precisely the manner that Congress intended, by a

20

criminal conviction and by the imposition of a criminal

21

penalty.

That policy was wholly vindicated.
QUESTION:

11

You could say the same of someone who was

12

convicted of theft from the mails.

That the policy of the

13

statute prohibiting theft was fully vindicated when he was sent

14

to prison for two years and fined $10,000.

15

the reaction of most courts would be quite different in that

16

case to the one that you suggest.

17

MR. SECULAR:

And I daresay that

I would suggest that the criminal

10

statutes are not a basis for that kind of public policy

19

inquiry.

20

is a basis for the inquiry.

21

government's brief as suggesting anything more than that.

22

policy that it is looking to at least in the brief is the

23

policy that emanates from the Postal Reorganization Act itself.

24
25

We do acknowledge that the Postal Reorganization Act
And I did not read the
The

And the theory, as I stated before, is a limited
theory, that the Act imposes on management certain duties, and

Heritage

41
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

that this award requires management to violate those duties.
QUESTION:

Mr. Secular, on the other side of the

coin, there have been instances where people have been
acquitted of a postal violation and still discharged from the
Postal Office.
MR. SECULAR:

That is correct.

Obviously, the

standard of proof under a criminal statute is higher.

So that

an arbitrator could decide that even if the proof did not rise
to the level that a man could be convicted under the reasonable
double standard, that there was still sufficient reason to
discharge the employee.
I would like to respond now to certain specific
contentions that the Postal Service advanced in its reply
brief.
The government makes reference to cases which involve
contracts which have been held to violate public policy,
because of their tendency to iriduce improper conduct.

And that

perspective, I think, underlies the argument that enforcement
of this award may encourage misconduct by Hyde's coworkers.
I do not think that that is a fair interpretation of
the award or of the Union's position.

The beginning of the

award makes clear that the Union acknowledged throughout that
delay of the mail is improper and that it is cause for
discipline, and that it could be the basis for discharge.
The Union's argument here was that there was a change

Heritage

42
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

in circumstances, a material change in circumstances, based on

2

the fact that Hyde is now being treated.

3

any rational calculus, that whatever benefits a reasonable

4

employee might determine he would derive from delaying the

5

mail, and I do not know what they are, would not be outweighed

6

by the costs recognized by this award, which include criminal

7

conviction, a suspension of almost one year in length without

8

pay, and the possibility of discharge, if he is unable to

9

convince the arbitrator that there are grounds for

10

I do not see how by

reinstatement based on mitigating circumstances.
In addition, I want to make the point that at this

11
12

point that to assert that the award may encourage others, may

13

set a bad example for other employees, is in Misco's language

14

sheer speculation.

Town of Newton v. Rumery, we would take the position that in

QUESTION:

If we could predict the future with certainly, and we would

QUESTION:

If a reasonable person would have to come

to the conclusion that it would result in the violation of a

statute, surely, that would be enough, would it not, if that is

18

the only conclusion that a reasonable person could draw?

19

MR. SECULAR:

I would agree with that proposition in

20

the abstract.

21

that a discipline case is ever going to come before the Court

22

in that posture. I can envision work rule cases where the

23

arbitrator commands management or the Postal Service to operate

24

in a certain way which is inconsistent with the statute.
