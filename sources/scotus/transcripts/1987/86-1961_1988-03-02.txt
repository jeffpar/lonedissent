ORAL ARGUMENT OF RANDALL E. ROSE, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

7

9

MR. ROSE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The nature of the case to be presented in this

10

argument involves a challenge to the constitutionality of

11

certain Oklahoma statutes providing for notice by publication

12

to creditors in a probate proceeding.

13

Section 331 of Title 58 of the Oklahoma Statutes sets

14

forth that notice provision.

15

notice by publication.

16

The sole notice provided is a

The Appellant, here and after referred to as TPCS,

17

challenged the constitutionality of this statute for failing to

18

provide a meaningful notice to creditors in the context of a

19

probate proceeding that would afford due process as required by

20

the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

21

Upon review of the facts in this case and an

22

application of the Oklahoma statutory scheme, it will be clear

23

that current Oklahoma law does not provide a meaningful notice.

24

It is our position that an analysis of the relevant decisions

25

of this Court will require due process to be extended to known

1

or reasonably ascertainable creditors.

2

It is further our position that contrary to

3

assertions in various state supreme court decisions, that (1) a

4

creditor's interest in a probate proceeding is a property

5

right,

6
7

(2) -QUESTION;

Mr. Rose, incidentally, did the decedent

die in the hospital?

8

MR. ROSE;

Yes, he did, Your Honor.

9

QUESTION;

Why weren't they then on some kind of

10

notice that there was an estate probably to be probated?

11

MR. ROSE;

Well, that —

12

QUESTION:

They certainly knew her address.

13

MR. ROSE:

Yes, that's true, Your Ho.no r.

a

That

14

actually is the entire crux of this case.

15

the statement of facts will have shown that the decedent died

16

in the hospital, and we had notice obviously that he died.

17

It is undisputed and

The question is not whether we had notice that he

18

died, but whether we had notice of the initiation of the

19

probate proceeding and the publication of the notice to

20

creditors to file their claims.

21

QUESTION:

Was this a Tulsa hospital?

22

MR. ROSE:

Yes, it was.

23

QUESTION:

It is certainly a less sympathetic case

24
25

than if your creditor were off in New York or somewhere.
MR. ROSE:

It is not the ideal case to present the
4

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

However, again, the question is not whether we had

1

issue.

2

notice.

3

a stipulated fact that we had notice that he died.

4

Oklahoma, a probate case can be filed, Title 58, Section 22 of

5

the Oklahoma Statutes provides that a probate case can be filed

6

at any time after the death of the decedent.

7
8

No one has denied, it has been readily admitted, it's

QUESTION:

Well, certainly,

In

I've known of hospitals

that routinely watch the legal notices in legal newspapers --

9

MR. ROSE:

That's correct.

10

QUESTION:

-- or they go down and check the probate

11

office and get their claim in.

12

MR. ROSE:

That's correct.

13

QUESTION:

Your hospital just sat by and let it go,

14

even though the death was in Tulsa and even though the decedent

15

was a Tulsa resident.

16

MR. ROSE:

Yes.

18

QUESTION:

Well, isn't it so?

19

MR. ROSE:

It is not so.

17

20
21

It would appear that way on the

surface.

If I may respectfully

disagree with you.
In this particular case, there was an additional

22

statutory procedure available, originally enacted in 1910, that

23

states that the representative of the estate must pay the

24

expenses of last illness and funeral expenses as soon as

25

practicable after the funds come into his hands.

3

QUESTION:

Well, that is a peculiar Oklahoma quirk, I

suppose, but how does it really affect your case?
MR. ROSE:

In that situation, it is not — it has

4

historically been the case that you do not have to file a

5

creditor's claim to collect a bill --

6

7

QUESTION:

The Supreme Court of Oklahoma held

otherwise in this case.

8

MR. ROSE:

That's correct. That's correct.

9

Again, I think that the difficulty is in this case,

10

just as in this Court's decision in Mennonite Board of Missions

11

v. Adams in 1983, and although that was a closely-divided

12

decision in that case, the Court determined that the notice of

13

the delinquency of taxes was not the same thing as the notice

14

that the property was going to be sold.

15

In Oklahoma, in the Mennonite case, for example,

16

there is a time period, there was a time period within which

17

that tax sale would take place.

18

nature of the statutes that we have to work with and as

19

provided in Section 22 of Title 58, that notice period, the

20

time within which to present your claim, can begin to run any

21

time from the date of death of the decedent until forever.

22

In Oklahoma, because of the

Now, there is some statutory construction of this

23

particular statute.

There are specific cases that say three

24

years and five years and fifteen years and twenty-six years.

25

So, in certain specific cases, it has been as much as twenty6

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

six years before the probate case was filed.
QUESTION:

2

And the later it goes, the less time you

3

have to file.

As I recall, if it's five years after the death,

4

you only get one month after the notice is published instead of

5

two.

6

MR. ROSE:

That's correct. That's correct.

7

QUESTION:

So, you theoretically have to keep reading

8

the newspapers for -MR. ROSE:

9
0

case.

That is the difficulty with the whole

You have to keep track of every debtor in every legal

11

publication, every newspaper that's defined as a legal

12

publication in Oklahoma, in every county in Oklahoma, and you

3

have to read every notice that's published, every day, in order

4

to keep track of a specific debtor.

5

And, again, because of the nature of the statutory

6

scheme in Oklahoma, you have to do that for five or ten or

7

fifteen or twenty years.

8

Section 22 is that it says that the general statute of

9

limitations, the longest one that is available in Oklahoma of

20

five years, that general set of statutes of limitations from

21

one to five years for different causes of action, that statute

22

of limitations does not apply.

23
24
25

So, it's open.

I think the interesting thing about

The probate case can be filed at any

time after the death.
QUESTION:

Can you file a claim before the notice

MR. ROSE:

2

You can file a claim, but the difficulty

is in discovering that a probate case is filed.

So, it's the

QUESTION:

You don't think that's so hard, do you?

MR. ROSE:

Well, the only method of doing —■ well, you can call
You can call the court clerk's

2

office every day and ask them if a probate case had been filed

3

in the name of that decedent.

4

QUESTION:

15
6
7

I would think particularly representing a

collection agency, as you do, that would be quite a staple of
their business.
MR. ROSE:

Well, again, in the context of this case

8

and the way it arose, the fact that this Section 594 Title 58

9

had been relied on historically for the proposition that all

20

funeral expenses and expenses of last illness are supposed to

2

be paid, no mention of a claim, that is something that the

22

hospital had done.

23

I think the important thing is, and I think that this

24

is the thing that the Oklahoma Supreme Court looked at, why did

25

the Oklahoma Supreme Court take this case.

Why did they decide

8

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

this issue.

2

had actual notice, so we're not going to decide the issue.

3

They could have said, well, wait a minute, they

What they did say, though, on page 7-A of the

4

jurisdictional statement, they said that, well, the Court of

5

Appeals was wrong in saying that the Appellee didn't — that

6

the Appellant didn't show that they didn't have actual notice.

7

They said that's not the burden of the Appellant.

8
9

The Appellee's burden is to show that the proper
notice was given.

All the Appellee can say is we published and

10

that's what's required by statute. So, we've done everything

11

that we could.

QUESTIONS

13

notice.

14

You don't acknowledge you have actual

Are you acknowledging that you had actual notice?
MR. ROSE:

Of what?

16

QUESTION:

Of the death.

MR. ROSE:

Because the --

That's right.

at all.
It starts nothing. Nothing

happens when the person dies necessarily.
QUESTION:

You could say the same thing about the

23

creditor of a contract claim. He has actual notice that his

24

claim exists, but that's of no use until he knows that a

25

bankruptcy proceeding has started.
9

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

MR. ROSE:

1

That's true, and I think that you may be

2

making reference to this Court's decision in the 1953 New York

3

v. New York-New Haven Railroad Company, where this Court

4

decided that mailed notice was required to creditors of that

5

debtor.

6

not any different.

That was a railroad reorganization case, but it was

7

QUESTION:

8

constitutional law?

9

MR. ROSE:

10

That was decided as a matter of

I believe so.

If — in that case, it's --

the factual situation is extremely similar to the factual

11

situation in this case, and even still, in that case, and as a

12

result of the extension of the holding of that case under

13

current bankruptcy law, current bankruptcy rules provide that a

14

notice to creditors must be sent out within some statutory time

15

period, sixty days or something from the time of filing.
QUESTION:

16
17

It just occurred to me, there's only one

probate court in Tulsa, isn't there?

18

MR. ROSE:

That's correct.

19

QUESTION:

So, it's only one court you have to watch?

20

MR. ROSE:

That's correct.

But, again, Justice

21

Marshall, you then have to call that courthouse every day for

22

-- no.

23

pardon me?

24

the notice to creditors is published, you only have sixty days

25

to file a claim.

That's true. You just have to continue to monitor -No, not in this case, because in this case, when

10

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

QUESTION:

Well, once every sixty days.

2

MR. ROSE:

You could do that and you could do that

3

for up to apparently at least twenty-six years throughout --

4

for every debtor that you had in every county in Oklahoma, and

5

in every county and every state that also has a short-term non-

6

claim statute, such as we have in Oklahoma.

7

8

QUESTION:

But you wouldn't have had to do it very

long in this case?

9

MR. ROSE:

In this particular case, that's correct.

10

QUESTION:

Well, that's the case we're judging.

11

12

Not

some other.
MR. ROSE:

The importance, though, is that we did not

13

have notice of the initiation of the probate proceeding and the

14

subsequent publication of notice to creditors.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Well, that's true, that's true, but you

could have had.
MR. ROSE:

We could have had. I think that's an

18

important point.

Had we had notice, if we had known, not that

19

the decedent died, but if we had known that the probate case

20

was filed and the notice to creditors was published, —

21

QUESTION:

Oh, sure.

22

MR. ROSE:

-- then we would have filed a claim.

23

QUESTION:

Sure you would have, but you could have

24

easily found out.

It wouldn't have taken a whole lot of effort

25

to find out in this case.

There may be some other creditors,
11

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

you wouldn't expect them to inquire, but a collection agency --

2

MR.

ROSE:

Well, again,

in this case,

this was under

3

a different statutory scheme, that all I can tell you has been

4

QUESTION:
That's your job,

isn't it?

8

MR.

QUESTION:

10

You're a professional organization.

ROSE:

That's right, Your Honor.
This isn't an inordinate -- I mean,

it's too much for you to send somebody by there once a week?

11

MR.

12

QUESTION:

Do you check the legal papers?

13

MR.

ROSE:

I think that the focus should be --

That's it.

15
16

ROSE:

We try to collect the money.

17

I think that the focus should be on not just keeping track of a

18

single creditor — of a single debtor, certainly keeping track

19

of a single debtor, when you isolate on that one single

20

creditor -- that single debtor,

21

it is easy to -- you can say --

you can always say you could have looked out for that single

22

debtor -- yes, but the difficulty is in doing that,

QUESTION:

of them could be assigned to reading probate notices.

That is precisely my point, and that is -

MR. ROSE:

QUESTION:

Do you think that Oklahoma should direct

their laws particularly to cooperate with you, to your company?

To cooperate with all creditors that are

have all that trouble, would he?
QUESTION:

You are focusing on the collection agency.

I'd like to focus on the real creditor, the hospital.

MR. ROSE:

On the hospital.

QUESTION:

1

And I can't get much sympathy for your

2

argument about every county and every state when you have a

Tulsa decedent and a Tulsa hospital and the Tulsa probate.

4

Well, in Oklahoma, let me ask this, in Oklahoma,

5

where is the probate instituted?
MR. ROSE:

6

It's in the county of residence.

It can

be in the county where the property is located.
QUESTION:

8
9

In the county of residence?

But in — this decedent was a resident of

this particular county.

MR. ROSE:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

I can't see the great burden that is on

12

your client, either the hospital or the collection agency.

13

just can't get very sympathetic about it.

QUESTION:

You concede that?

13

MR. ROSE:

14

QUESTION:

Didn't you say a moment ago, and if you

15

didn't say this, please, that in Mennonite, we decided the

16

general notice question, although in that particular case, the

17

claimant had had notice, had had actual notice?

18

MR. ROSE:

Well, the reference I made to Mennonite

19

was that the notice of the delinquency of taxes was not the

20

same thing as the notice of the pendency of a sale.

same situation here.

22

thing as the notice of the pendency of the probate proceeding

23

or the subsequent

The notice of the death is not the same

Since that might have taken place

considerably later, is your point.
16

1

MR. ROSE:

Pardon me?

2

QUESTION:

Since the probate proceeding might have

3

been commenced considerably after the death.

4

MR. ROSE:

Certainly, certainly.

5

QUESTION:

I think before we got into all the factual

6

background of the case, you were beginning to say why this was

7

like Mennonite, that you thought there was a property interest

8

here.

9

MR. ROSE:

Right.

The arguments that have been used

10

to defeat a claim of unconstitutionality of a particular

11

statute have included that there is no adjudication of property

12

rights. For example, in that specific case, the state has

13

suggested that notice by mailing is only required, may only be

14

required when tangible property interests are involved.

15

However, in the Mennonite case, there were cases

16

cited that set forth interests that were not tangible property

17

interests, and those included the student's right to a public

18

education, the right to continue utility service during the

19

time that a disputed bill remained unpaid.

20

The New York case example of a debt owed to a

21

creditor in a bankruptcy proceeding as well as the Mullane

22

example of a trustee's obligation to provide an accounting.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Of course, in the Mullane case, there was

an existing interest in personal property.
MR. ROSE:

That's true.
17

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1
2

QUESTION:

And in Mennonite, there was an existing

interest in real property.

3

MR. ROSE:

That's' true.

4

QUESTION:

And here you have what's traditionally

5
6

just a claim in personam, a contract claim for payment.
MR. ROSE:

That's true.

But it's an intangible

7

property interest just as a student's right to a public

8

education is an intangible property right.

9

QUESTION:

But the law has always treated quite

10

differently interests in property as opposed to contractual

11

interests, has it not?

12

MR. ROSE:

Yes, it has.

But the law also does not

13

15

QUESTION:

Many, many things certainly can be

property under our due process decisions that are not classical

17

interests in personal property or real property, but,

18

nonetheless, I think you probably have to deal with the

19

proposition that traditionally a statute of limitations dealing

20

with real property is much longer than a statute of limitations

21

dealing with contract rights and that sort of thing.

22

MR. ROSE:

True.

Well, another argument that has

23

been used to defeat the claim of the unconstitutionality of a

24

particular statute is that a non-claim statute is a statute of

25

limitations, so that notice by publication would be sufficient.
18

A non-claim statute, though, is not the same either

2

by definition or by its application as a long-term statute of

3

limitations is the traditional statute of limitations.

4

traditional statute of limitations, there is the concept of

5

repose for the claim and the concept that stale claims will be

6

precluded by the running of the statutory period.

7

In a

In the short-term statute that some courts have

8

referred to as a statute of limitations, there is not that same

9

possibility.

The idea of the claim resting, repose for the

10

claim, doesn't exist in just a sixty-day time period, and the

11

claim is not going to become stale in that time period.

12

QUESTION^

The interest there, I suppose, of the

13

state is not to ward off stale claims, but to say that after

14

someone dies, it's imperative to wind up his affairs more

15

rapidly and you simply relied on the statute of limitations.
MR. ROSE:

16

That's correct. In those states with

17

longer-term statutes, the same kinds of policy considerations

18

or policy considerations of those states and yet, they have a

19

true statute of limitations that is one to two up to six years.
In this non-claim statute, there is not that same

consideration.

You have to draw

5

The question is in applying the statute, in applying

the concept of due process, is the means that you use -- is it

7

going to accomplish the purpose that you intend for it to to

accomplish.
In the short-term non-claims statute, or in a longer-

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILLIP K. SMITH, ESQ.

19

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

20
21
22

MR. SMITH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Immediately, I would like to address several

23

statements made by Appellant Hospital, both in their

24

jurisdictional statement in their briefs as well as in the oral

25

argument just concluded that are no where to be found in the
22

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

record.

2

These are very pertinent statements.

The most

3

blatant of which is that the personal representative had actual

4

knowledge of the claim of the hospital at the time her husband

5

died as well as at the time that notice to creditors was

6

published.

7

For the first six years after the death of the

8

decedent, the Appellant Hospital relied exclusively on the

9

Oklahoma statute that set out certain preferences and

10

priorities of payment under Section 594 of our Probate Code,

11

and no court thus far has decided that that relieved them of

12

the burden of filing a notice to creditors, that not until the

13

case had been tried on that issue in the original probate

14

court, had been heard by the Oklahoma Court of Appeals,

15

upon petition for rehearing to the Oklahoma Court of Appeals,

16

approximately August of 1985, did the Appellant Hospital raise

17

the issue of due process.
Now, up until that point,

18

and

the exclusive question

19

before the court was the question of priority of payment of

20

debts.

21

The fact that the personal representative had actual

22

knowledge of the claim is no where to be found in the record,

23

and we dispute that fact, and we have continually disputed it

24

in our brief.

determined?
MR. SMITH:

That's correct.

We are ready to meet

10

that issue as a matter of fact because we maintain that she had

11

no knowledge of any claim pending at the time either that he

12

died or the time that she published notice to creditors.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

Do you also maintain that the hospital

knew of the probate proceeding?
MR. SMITH:

We do not maintain that they knew of the

16

probate proceeding at the time that he died or that we gave

17

them actual notice.

18

QUESTION:

19
20
21
22

Well, I guess there wasn't a probate

proceeding before he died.
MR. SMITH:

That's right.

We don't know when the

hospital found out about the probate proceeding.

QUESTION:

23

dates here.

There are no exemptions made for in state

creditors, just on the basis that they had no knowledge.
QUESTION:

case.

13

QUESTION:

Right.

14

QUESTION:

What was the reason, if any, that notice

15

was not given to the hospital?

16

MR. SMITH:

Notice was not given for two reasons.

creditor of the estate.

MR. SMITH:

15

We had no trouble with the IRS on that

question and received releases from both tax entities.
The reason I mentioned the deduction on the tax

return is that to show the good faith of Mrs. Pope because she

did not declare any money due and owing to St. John Medical

office that an executor takes, they are under a duty to not

interests, but also to pay any valid debts of the estate.
I still believe that there is a dual role there to be

I would also state that

the practice in Oklahoma as well as possibly other

19

jurisdictions is to pay claims, even though proper creditors

20

claims are not presented, and this is done and while if you

every day.

In Oklahoma, it is the practice.

You made the statement you thought it was

generally the practice, and I questioned that one.
MR. SMITH:

5

In Oklahoma, excuse me, insurance

6

payments continue to be made by the employer sponsored

insurance carrier until approximately February of 1980. So, as

8

to the determination of the debt, not only when he died, but

9

when she gave notice to creditors, she didn't know any exact

10

amount and I dare say the hospital didn't know because it could

11

have, in fact, been paid off in full.
So, at best, it was a contingent claim and provisions

12

13

are made under the same Oklahoma non-claims statute, Section

14

333, for contingent claims, and it provides that a creditor of

a letter?

We maintain that to do that causes a

burden upon personal representatives who are not always the

spouse of the decedent, to find out exactly who the creditors

are, and this is a genuine problem where personal

Yes, but the question Justice Stevens

16

poses is whatever kind of administrator you have, if the

17

administrator actually knows of a creditor, must he give them

18

notice.

MR. SMITH:

QUESTION:

22

Not under this statute.
Well, the question is, does the

Constitution require more.
MR. SMITH:

I don't believe so.

I don't believe so.

23

If you assume — just take an example.

Let's say Mr. Pope had

24

some outside business interests and this is not uncommon for

25

people to do this without making it a matter of record, let's

But what about Mary?

Neither Mary nor

John happened to find out about Mr. Pope's death and thus much

less know about a probate.
It's not fair, we urge the Court, that Mary should be

QUESTION:

14

I come back to the facts of this case.

15

Her husband was in the hospital for several weeks.

knew a hospital bill was accumulating.

17

she didn't know whether or not it was paid.

hospital.
QUESTION:

Bank of Tulsa, if you have one, they certainly would have

investigated it.

23

MR. SMITH:

This goes outside the record again, but

24

to answer your question, a personal representative, the wife of

25

the deceased, had prior experiences with this hospital and with

this husband and with this insurance carrier in which she never

Up to this point, they had never filed anything in

5

after the probate had been initiated.
QUESTION:

6

If we rule in favor of the Appellant, is

7

there a concern that the cost of probate will escalate because

8

the cost of executor bonds will be higher, etc.?

9

MR. SMITH:

Yes, Justice Kennedy, that is one

10

concern.

We concede that a twenty-two cent stamp to give

11

notice is not a problem, but there could possibly be a problem

12

with responsibility upon the fiduciary to perform under their

13

bond and to give notice because under the earlier example of

Mr. Smith, suppose Oklahoma wants to

judgment scheme in which you can file a declaratory judgment

outstanding debts against you or exactly what claims there are

25

against you, and it adopts the same system we have here, you

simply have public notice of the suit by publishing it in a

2

newspaper and any creditor who doesn't come in within sixty

3

days, asserting a claim, shall be barred, and you'll get a

4

declaratory judgment that that debt is no longer relevant, do

5

you think that would be constitutional?
MR. SMITH:

6

I would ask, does the debtor have

7

knowledge of the identity of the creditors in that case, and if

8

so,

--

QUESTION:

10

MR. SMITH:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. SMITH:

Yes.
Excuse me.
Does the debtor have knowledge?
Yes.

Yes.

If they have knowledge, that's one

13

thing, and in order to declare a declaratory judgment, I

14

believe that this Court's decisions would find grounds to

15

declare that unconstitutional.

16

QUESTION:

Now, why is this different?

Why couldn't

17

I call that a statute of limitations just as well as you want

18

us to call this one a statute of limitations?

19

MR. SMITH:

Because in this case, there was no

20

declaratory judgment nor are there in probate matters. It's

21

simply the running of the statute which is similar to the case

22

of Texaco, Inc., v. Short, decided by this case, in which it

23

determined that the running of a statute of limitations acts to

24

cut those potential claims off as opposed to a declaratory

25

judgment in Mu1lane and Mennonite.
39

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

That is one of the distinctions that we draw.

1

The

2

Appellant Hospital in this case attempted six years after the

3

probate was started to draw the facts of this case to fit under

4

the third Moseley case that came out of the Supreme Court of

5

Nevada.

The facts do not apply at all.

6

In that third Moseley case, the personal

7

representative had actual knowledge of the creditors' claims.

8

The creditor had a pending lawsuit against the deceased at the

9

time of death.

The creditor in Moseley did not know of the

10

death of the decedent until the final day for filing claims and

11

they filed two days late.

12

That wasn't deemed to be fair and I don't believe

13

that it was fair, but it's not the facts of this case.

14

why it's important to understand some of the facts as they have

15

been stated in the briefs that are not in the record and which

16

distinguish the case on that basis.

17

I think there's also --

18

QUESTION:

That's

How do you distinguish the City of New

19

York case holding that notice by publication was not sufficient

20

for creditors in filing claims in a bankruptcy estate?

21

MR. SMITH:

I think part of the answer goes to the

22

nature of a bankruptcy versus the nature of a probate action.

23

The whole nature of the case in New York that you're referring

24

to has to do with getting the bankrupt debtor a fresh start in

25

that case, a reorganization under another company.
40

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

That debtor in the New York case knew of New York

1

2

City's existing interest in the real property. Not only that,

3

but in that particular case, the judge, according to the

4

findings, failed to properly follow the statute in requiring

5

all creditors to be given mailed notice.
Another distinction is that the notice that was given

6
7

to the creditors in that New York bankruptcy case had to do of

8

a court order.

9

limitations.

It was not the running of the statute of
It was the court order that they were supposed to

10

have given notice to New York City about that they failed to

11

do.

12

So, I think from that standpoint, there are several

13

distinguishing factors between a bankruptcy in which all

14

creditors were known or the debtor wouldn't be in the

15

bankruptcy court to begin with because he knows who's putting

16

the pressure on him from the credit standpoint.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, is there any provision in the

18

Oklahoma Probate Code that requires the executor or the

19

administrator to make any kind of representation to the court

20

that all known debts have been paid?

21

MR. SMITH:

There is not currently a requirement.

22

is frequent in orders allowing final accounts that all

23

creditors who have filed claims have been paid.

24

your question.

25

QUESTION:

4

under the broad scope of due process and no one can define what

Sometimes, such as in Mu1lane and Mennonite, this

fair or reasonable opportunity requires a hearing before the

not require a hearing, such as in the Texaco case, and we

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT - REBUTTAL

Justice Stevens, I believe, was asking a question

about how quickly can that time period pass within which to

The practice is and what is preferred by the Court is

a ninety-day time period.

MR. ROSE:
