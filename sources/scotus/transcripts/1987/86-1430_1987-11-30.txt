Mr. Schimmel, you may

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE IAN SCHIMMEL, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. SCHIMMEL:

6

7

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
At issue in this case is the constitutionality of
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure Number 329(b)(f).
The question presented is whether any state may

11

require a defendant to show a meritorious defense to the

12

underlying issues in order to vacate a default judgment which

13

has been entered without personal jurisdiction or is void as a

14

result of procedural errors that have risen to the level of a

15

denial of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.

16

I am here today because my client, Mr. Roy Peralta,

17

has and is continuing to be deprived as the result of a void

18

judgment that was entered in Texas and filed with the Real

19

Property Records of Harris County.

20

This judgment, I cannot help him overturn, and he

21

cannot be relieved of as a result of the Catch-22 system of

22

procedures in the Texas courts.

23

his real property sold for $1,720, an execution sale on this

24

void judgment.

25

him for $5,600 on a debt that was previously unliquidated,

Mr. Peralta has had $80,000 of

Additionally, he has an award entered against

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

$1,867 for attorneys fees that are going to be paid to an

2

attorney who violated his duty to the court by making a motion

3

for entry on a judgment where the service showed on its face

4

that it was void.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. SCHIMMEL:

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Schimmel, —
Yes, sir.

— I understand your opponents in this

8

case to contend that Texas does provide relief from this sort

9

of judgment and certainly from execution on it, but that you

10

11

simply have taken the wrong procedural tact.
MR. SCHIMMEL:

Well, to begin with, they are improper

12

in their statement of the law.

13

certified expert on these matters, and if we could have taken a

14

collateral attack, I certainly would have taken it.

15

Believe me, I'm a Board-

However, even if that opportunity were open to us,

16

that would not make Rule 329(b)(f) constitutional.

17

has addressed the issue of post-judgment remedies before in Coe

18

and in the other case that came up from Texas, Manzo v.

19

Armstrong, Armstrongv.Manzo, and has said that the only thing

20

that you can do is to give us a brand-new trial in this matter

21

to put us in the exact same position.

22

This is what is constitutionally mandated.

23

QUESTION:

This Court

Well, again, I had thought that, at least

24

one of your opponents contended, that had you followed the

25

proper Texas procedure, you could have ended up with a new
4
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

trial rather tharr just having to produce a meritorious defense.
MR. SCHIMMEL:

2
3

No, sir. They would try to confuse

this Court on what the status of Texas law is.
This judgment recites in it that it was served, that

4
5

it was served regularly, and because that recitation is in this

6

void judgment,

7

attack, as you will see in,

8

the case to you in a moment, but as you will see in the Texas

9

courts, it clearly states because the judgment recites on its

in Texas courts, if we had taken a collateral
for instance, -- well, I'll cite

10

face that service was regularly, you cannot attack it

11

collaterally.

12
13

So, they are correct, and besides, that's not a
matter of —

14

QUESTION:

To solve that, we don't have to strike

15

down the whole rule. We can just say the rule is no good if you

16

do not allow collateral attack. Would that satisfy you?

17

MR. SCHIMMEL:

18

QUESTION:

No, sir, because —

Because if there is collateral attack, the

19

rule makes a lot of sense to me.

20

MR. SCHIMMEL:

21

QUESTION:

I understand, but if there were, would you

still say the rule was no good?

24
25

To begin with, there's not collateral

attack, and —

22
23

Why was the Court's time?

MR. SCHIMMEL:
why, sir.

Yes, sir, I would, and let me tell you

Because we would still choose to directly attack it.

1

If it's void,

2

the collateral attack or it should be void in a direct attack,

3

and we would want to take a direct attack to clear the court

4

records.

5

it's void for all purposes.

It should be void in

The collateral attack would not clear this other

6

record out of the judgments, and as long as it's in the

7

judgments, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, my client's

8

credit would be ruined.

9

attack will not clear the original abstracted judgment.

It will not clear -- a collateral
A

10

collateral attack may return us our property that has been

11

taken as a result of this, but it will not make the unsatisfied

12

portion of the original judgment, which can be re-executed

13

upon, disappear.

14

It's all still there.

What do we have to do?

Wait until they can again

15

attach more of our property under the original judgment and

16

then go and try and get that back again?
QUESTION:

17
18

Wait until you're harmed,

else.

19

MR. SCHIMMEL:

20

QUESTION:

21
22

like everybody

Well, we're harmed.

Your only immediate harm, as I understand

it, is going to be your credit rating.
MR. SCHIMMEL:

That is —

No, sir, that is not our only

23

immediate harm.

Since Pinnoyerv.Neff, it has been this

24

Court's opinion, as I understand it,

25

judgment itself is a taking of a liberty interest from us.

that the entry of a

6

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

We have a right not to be a judgment debtor.

2

QUESTION:

3

Mr. Schimmel, doesn't Paul v. Davis

suggest there's no liberty interest in reputation alone?
MR. SCHIMMEL:

4

No, ma'am.

I believe that Paul v.

5

Davis is really not applicable for several reasons.

6

that that case turned on whether or not the tort that occurred

7

was, in fact, a change in status, unlike Wisconsin v.

8

Constantineau, where we actually had a law that allowed a

9

change of status where a person was not able to buy liquor once

10

I think

an official officially made him a "drunkard".

11

In Paul v. Davis, there was no statute that said a

12

person could not get a job or could not shop once the chief of

13

police has determined that he is a "shop lifter", and I think

14

that's really where Paul v. Davis is distinguishable from the

15

situation here.

16

Here, when the Court says it is —

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Schimmel, let me ask you something

18

else.

Could you bring in Texas a declaratory judgment to

19

establish whether or not the judgment against your client was

20

void?
MR. SCHIMMEL:

21

No, ma'am, and the reason is qujte

22

clear.

Anything other than a bill of review is an indirect

23

attack and because the judgment itself cites on it that service

24

was regular, even though constitutionally it would seem to me

25

that if it's void, even the recitation of regular service
7

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

should also not stand up, that's not the law in Texas.
Crawford v. McDonald and the other cases say that if

2
3

it says on its face that the judgment is void, that will be

4

preclusive.

5

effect is unconstitutional, but that's not really the issue in

6

front of us.

It would seem to me that even this preclusive

QUESTION:

7

Well, let me ask you this.

Does Texas law

8

allow you to prevent all efforts to enforce the judgment in

9

this case by collateral means?
MR. SCHIMMEL:

10

In actuality, it would not, and the

11

reason would be because although we would be able to get a

12

temporary injunction during the pendency of the collateral

13

attack, because the collateral attack would have to fail as a

14

result of the recitation of the judgment, at the end of that

15

pendency, the injunction would be vacated, and then they would

16

be open to taking our property again and doing all these other

17

things to us.

18

So, the answer to that question would be no, ma'am.

19

QUESTION:

20

proceedings going on right now?
MR. SCHIMMEL:

21
22
23
24
25

Well, aren't you -- don't you have some

Yes, sir.

The proceedings that we

have —
QUESTION:

Well, you aren't taking them just for

exercise, are you?
MR. SCHIMMEL:

No, sir, we are not, and I think that
8

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

it needs to be made clear to the Court why we are taking these

2

other proceedings.

3

During the discovery on this case, we have found

4

that, in fact, the purchasers who purchased at this execution

5

sale have also gone back and gone to the lender that Mr.

6

Peralta was making his payments to, unknown to him, and gotten

7

a second deed for a — we feel it's a fraudulent deed for

8

closure of the lender's lien against my client.

9

didn't find out about this until not only after he had paid off

10
11
12

13

the loan entirely —
QUESTION:

So, what are you — what proceedings do

you have going on?
MR. SCHIMMEL:

Well, that is what we call trespass to

14

try title in order to get —

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. SCHIMMEL:

17

My client

What if you win that?
If we win that, that will not -- well,

first of all, we can't win that with this judgment.

18

QUESTION:

Well, why did you bring it?

19

MR. SCHIMMEL:

Because we want to toll the statute of

20

limitations on the second deed, not the one that issued out of

21

the constable on this execution sale. The one that issued that

22

out of the lender on the foreclosure of the --

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Trespass to try title.

So, you're going

to lose that case, is that it?
MR. SCHIMMEL:

If we do not win here, we
9

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

automatically lose that case because in trespass to try title,

2

you must prove -- you have a burden placed upon you to prove

3

your ownership good as against the entitled world.

4

rely on the infirmity of the defendant's ownership.

5

prove it good as against the entitled world and as a result of

6

that, this judgment execution, even if it hadn't been to the

7

Chinns, I might add, who were the purchasers at the foreclosure

8

sale on the trustee's fees, even if it hadn't been to them,

9

would make the Chinns victorious in their suit in the second

10
11

You cannot
You must

case.
QUESTION:

But, Mr. Schlmmel, if your real problem,

12

if your real complaint is the inability to make a collateral

13

attack, which is what you're now discussing, surely the way to

14

remedy that is to appeal from the decision that does not allow

15

you to make a collateral attack, rather than to say that this

16

rule, Rule 19, is bad.

17

Rule 19 may be perfectly — assuming Rule 19 is okay,

18

if collateral attack is allowed, it seems to me a very strange

19

way to complain about the inability to make collateral attack

20

to come in saying Rule 19 is no good.

21

MR. SCHIMMEL:

Mr. Justice, when I sat down with this

22

case the first time and researched the law on it, the courts of

23

the State of Texas told me it was mandated for me to bring a

24

bill of review proceeding.

25

the State of Texas and brought the bill of review proceeding as

I followed the law of the courts of

10

a result of that.
If I do not prevail on this, it will be used as res

I think you would well have a good case

MR. SCHIMMEL:

8

9

If that happens, come and appeal the

It's my understanding that if the

theories in Pinnoyer v. Neff and Coe v. Armstrong are still

10

good law today, that we should be able to directly attack this.

11

If it's void,

12

void on collateral attack.

13

it's void on direct attack.

If it's void,

it's

Why should we be precluded from a default judgment

14

which was entered without jurisdiction?

15

me choose a way to attack something for my client?

16

a preclusive effect from the default — from the void judgment?

17

Isn't that a shifting of burden that was addressed in Armstrong

18

v. Manzo where it says that to shift these burdens is

19

unconstitutional?

22
23
24
25

Isn't that

That is the way we feel about it.

We should be at liberty to bring either one of those

20

21

Why should that make

attacks.
QUESTION:

Exactly what section of the Constitution

do you rely on?
MR. SCHIMMEL:

The due process clause of the

Fourteenth Amendment, sir.
11

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

QUESTION:

Would you explain how you get under that?

2

MR. SCHIMMEL:

Well, the law of the State of Texas

3

says that force and effect can be given where personal

4

jurisdiction has not been had over us.

5

you must have personal jurisdiction, otherwise it's void.

6

This case is very similar.

Am I correct that you all you are

objecting to is the rule?
MR. SCHIMMEL:

The rule and the cases that go with it

have meritorious defense under this rule, and that has become

24

part and parcel of the rule itself in the State of Texas.

MR. SCHIMMEL:

That's all.

Sir, there is a federal question

There is a federal question when a person is impinged

in his liberty to mortgage the property he already owns because

15

there is a judgment on the records, the real property records

of Harris County, Texas.

Mr. Peralta cannot go out and even mortgage the land

he already owns because no title insurance company will allow

him to do that.

the Court, not by me.

17

Why do you

Yes, sir.

And the only thing you say is the rule is

a bad rule.
MR. SCHIMMEL:

The rule requires us to show

without due process of law.

QUESTION:

I'm just at a loss as to what the federal

question is.

MR. SCHIMMEL:

The federal question is may any court

put a procedural burden of proving meritorious defense in order

19

to overturn a void judgment on a direct attack.

think,

is a very clear federal question.

If the Court then — since it is to the other area,

issue.

My other case is not a collateral attack on

This other case has to deal with a second deed

It just so happens to be that because of the status

6

of the law in trespass to try title, that I will automatically

7

be defeated on that because I will have to prove on behalf of

8

my client that not only was the deed from the trustee to --

9

from the trustee in the lender's situation to the Chinns, not

10

only was that void, but also every other impediment on our

11

title, whether it's this or any other judgment that an

12

execution is issued on, is also against us.

13

We must remove that from the record in order for us

14

to succeed on this other case, and that's why the other case

15

was brought.

16

QUESTION:

So, the other case does then, if you say

17

that's an essential part of it, it does involve a collateral

18

attack upon this case.

19

MR. SCHIMMEL:

No, sir, it does not.

It does not

20

MR. URQUHART:

An attempt to

Mr. Urquhart, could I interrupt you?
Yes.

The State of Texas has filed an amicus

curiae brief.

10

MR. URQUHART:

11

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

In which they say that once the time for

12

all of the prior proceedings, which they describe, have

13

elapsed, the only remaining way to directly attack the voidable

14

default judgment is through a bill of review.

15

Do you disagree with that statement?

16

MR. URQUHART:

I agree with the statement,

17

underlining that the only way to directly attack a void

18

judgment is through the bill of review mechanism.
QUESTION:

19

But, then, they go on and describe

20

injunctive relief, but they say that in the other reliefs, you

21

also must plead a meritorious defense.
MR. URQUHART:

22

Your Honor, what the Attorney

23

General's brief was doing was reciting methods of direct

24

attack.

25

under Texas law.

They were not raising the issue of collateral attack

21

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

The distinction between a direct attack and a

1

2

collateral attack is that the relief granted by direct attack

3

is a change in the attack judgment. In other words, you only

4

bring a direct attack if you have at least an arguable defense.
QUESTION:

5

Yes, but the consequence of bringing it is

6

that if you make such an allegation and have an arguable

7

defense, they set aside the judgment, don't they?
MR. URQUHART:

Only to immediately reinstate it, Your

Honor.

Only to immediately reinstate it?

MR. URQUHART:

Right.

You see, a direct attack like

General's brief, the result of those procedures is the granting

of a new trial.

16

procedures, and if you have no meritorious defense, then you're

17

wrong ever to pursue a direct attack under Texas law because

18

you're engaging in a waste of time.

19

That's the reason that you seek those

QUESTION:

Why is it a waste of time?

It would have

20

made a great deal of difference in this case if they had

21

granted relief by way of the bill of review because then you

22

couldn't have executed the — the execution would then fall

23

right away.

24

MR. URQUHART:

No.

Your Honor, if I can try to

directly respond to your question by explaining the bill of

review procedure.

I'm not trying to evade the question at all.

The bill of review procedure, understand, is an

3

equitable procedure that is available to people after

4

everything else has run out in terms of direct attack. It's

5

really designed not where there is a jurisdictional question

6

involved but where somebody has a good defense.

MR. URQUHART:

QUESTION:

And a court had jurisdiction.

But if you did have a good -- say you set

10

aside the judgment, said okay we'll now try the case, you try

MR. URQUHART:

I think I'd go further than that, Your

2

Honor.

In this case, we have to, I think, all of us, accept

3

that his allegations are correct and that it is, therefore, a

void judgment because of the posture that this case is in.
QUESTION:

5
6

Well, then, what's your objection to

opening the judgment?
MR. URQUHART:

7

Your Honor, my objection is simply

8

this, that what is being attacked in this case is a specific

9

procedure, and the specific procedure is a salutary procedure.

10

It enables people to recover who otherwise would not recover

11

and it is designed specifically for people who have defenses.
My objection is -- my opposition has a whole panoply

12
13

of remedies that they could pursue that would enable them to

14

achieve exactly the purpose that they want to achieve,
QUESTION:

15

Well, Mr. Urquhart, your opposing counsel

As a matter of

fact, if Your Honor —
QUESTION:

He said that's absolutely unavailable

where the judgment on its face recites service was proper.
MR. URQUHART:

All right.

First, Your Honor, that

7

question has not been presented properly to this Court because

8

the state court in Texas has not had an opportunity to say

9

after they have pursued the correct appeal that there is no

10
11

avenue of collateral attack.
There is law in Texas, so that all of the Justices of

12

the Court understand this, and I'm not misleading the Court,

13

there is law in Texas to the effect that a recitation in the

14

judgment controls.

15

that the record controls.

16

however, that if a recitation of judgment conflicts with the

17

record, specifically in this case, the record in this case

18

shows according to what we must accept true a defective

19

service, there is law in Texas which says that the Court can

20

consider that.

21

QUESTION:

There is also a law in Texas to the effect
There is also a law in Texas,

So, in other words, it's an open question

22

whether if this Petitioner follows some other procedure in

23

Texas, whether relief can be obtained?

24
25

MR. URQUHART:

Certainly, Justice O'Connor, and I

would think that the Texas courts should be given the
25

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

opportunity.

2

It's a 1938 case that's referred to in our brief and a bit

3

difficult to get through, but, basically, what the Commander v.

4

Bryan case does is take on the problem that is addressed and

5

then says that this presents possibly a due process guestion.

6

The Commander v. Bryan case is a very old case.

The Commander v. Bryan case has never been overruled.

7

It's never been strongly followed. So far as our research

8

indicates, there is no case, surprisingly, by our High Court or

9

even our intermediate courts where the constitutional due

10

process challenge to a collateral attack has ever been

11

overturned.

12

QUESTION:

But, Mr. Urquhart, the Texas court in its

13

opinion didn't make reference to any other remedy. Its answer

14

to the due process challenge was that as long as you have the

15

right to assert a meritorious defense, that's all you have to

16

do, but if you can't do that, you get no relief. That's

17

basically what that opinion says.

18

Would you defend that theory?

19

MR. URQUHART:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. URQUHART:

22

QUESTION:

I defend the opinion.

You do defend the opinion?
Yes, sir.

I do.

Supposing it also said there is no other

23

relief except the bill of review and you may not have any

24

relief unless you can assert a meritorious defense, would you

25

say that would be constitutional?
26
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

MR, URQUHART:

1

No, sir, and I don't believe that the

2

Justice Evans would have said that either when he wrote the

3

opinion.
QUESTION:

4

But if he's really saying your — the

5

response to the constitutional argument is you pursued the

6

wrong remedy, he didn't say that.

7

MR, URQUHART:

8

QUESTION:

9
30

Neither does the Texas Attorney General

identify any other remedy in which you do not have to prove a
meritorious defense. Am I right on that?

11

MR, URQUHART:

12

QUESTION:

13

Nor do I think, he had —

No, sir.

Respectfully.

Where does the Texas Attorney General call

our attention to the remedy you described?
MR. URQUHART:

14

In his first argument, where he says

15

that there is a collateral attack that is available.

16

right.

All

17

There is no specific rule or procedure that provides

18

for collateral attack, but there is a massive body of case law

19

in Texas that provides for collateral attack stemming from the

20

premise in AustinIndependentSchoolDistrict v. TheSierra

21

Club and others that says that a judgment without jurisdiction

22

is void and can be attacked, and I believe what the Attorney

23

General — excuse me, Your Honor.

24
25

I believe what the Attorney General was saying was
that the collateral attack is available and then he goes on, I
27

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

think principally for the help of the Court, to explain what

2

the direct attack remedies are and maybe there is a lack of

3

clarity in the brief. But his point, and I think it is an

4

accurate point, is that this judgment can be and should have

5

been, if there is any merit at all in what they're doing,

6

presented as a collateral attack.
QUESTION:

7

But is it not true that while the

8

collateral attack is pending, it takes time, I take it, to

9

litigate the collateral attack, the judgment remains on the

10

books and remains an impediment and a cloud on the title to the

11

assets of this litigant?

we take the facts as pleaded.
MR. URQUHART:

MR. URQUHART:

12

Well, the point is, Your Honor,

13

immediately upon receipt of any notification that any attempt

14

was made to execute on the judgment, they could have done a

15

wide variety of things, which, to this point, they still have

not done.
There is no suit on file at all attacking the

QUESTION:

Mr. Urquhart, as I understand your theory,

2

It's that there's no deprivation of property by the mere

3

existence on the books of this judgment which is void, right?

4

MR. URQUHART:

5

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

If that is so, how is it that we will

6

entertain an appeal to this Court on the basis of the due

7

process clause from the entry by a state supreme court of a

8

judgment in a matter in which it has no jurisdiction?

9

it happens all the time.

I mean,

A person comes here and says we've

10

been deprived of property without due process of law, not

11

because this judgment has been executed upon yet, but merely

12

because this Court is about to enter this judgment or has

13

entered this judgment.

14

We entertain those suits.

That must mean that the

15

mere existence of the judgment is a deprivation of property,

16

mustn't it?

17

MR. URQUHART:

Justice Scal.ia, my response to that

18

is, and I start to understand, sir, from the premise that if,

19

as we must accept, the judgment that we're dealing with is a

20

void judgment, all right, then that particular type of

21

judgment, one that is void as a matter of the law of our

22

jurisdiction, all right, cannot be a taking under the due

23

process clause.

You may be right.

It may well be a void

judgment because, if executed upon, it would deprive you of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

property without due process, but until it's executed upon,

2

there's no harm done.

3

there's no federal violation.

4

It is, after all, a void judgment. So,

Why wouldn't we have said that in all those cases?

The fact is we do entertain attacks on the basis that the state

had no jurisdiction on this matter.

the mere existence of that judgment.
MR. URQUHART:

Your Honor, while that, in the

12

abstract and in the important abstract, may be true, my belief

13

is that what we are dealing with in this Court and the only

14

thing that the record in this Court enables the United States

15

Supreme Court to deal with is the constitutionality of a very

16

specific procedure, which is designed for a very specific

purpose, not this purpose.

What happened in this case, I suggest, is that the

1

Then, Mr. Urquhart, certainly, it seems, I

guess, apparent to some my colleagues and perhaps to the

counsel that if this were the only provision of Texas law under

which one could attack a default judgment entered against him,

5

it might well lack something in the way of procedural due

-- I don't think I did that because,

first of all, I have not really agreed that this is a way to

10

attack a void judgment when you have no defense.

I thought, in

11

fact, I know that my intended point is that this is not even a

12

way to attack a void judgment unless you have a meritorious

13

defense.

14

I thought my other point, however, Your Honor, was

15

that there are many ways under Texas law that a void default

16

judgment can be attacked.

17

QUESTION:

That's not what you say in your brief.

18

You say in your brief after they say there's no other way to

19

attack the void judgment, you say, "Although this may be

20

technically correct, the implication that Appellant cannot

21

attack the enforcement of this judgment is wrong", and then in

22

your brief, you argue that his remedy was to enjoin the

23

enforcement of the judgment or to have it declared void.

24
25

That's quite different from saying there's another
way to attack a void judgment and have it wiped off the books
34

Heritage Reporting Corporation

and you do not identify any rule or statute that specifies a

2

collateral attack procedure which would result in vacating the

3

judgment.
MR. URQUHART:

4

All right.

Your Honor will note that

5

the Attorney General in its brief said that the judgment can be

6

attacked collaterally, that judgment can be attacked

7

collaterally as opposed to the enforcement.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. URQUHART:

10

13

That's true, Your Honor, but I think

that —
QUESTION:

11
12

You didn't say that in your brief.

The Texas Court of Appeals didn't say that

either.
MR. URQUHART:

I think, though, that at least from my

14

point of argument, that is a distinction without a difference.

15

The point Is that so long as the deprivation, the contended

16

deprivation, the taking of liberty or the taking of property

17

can be addressed, then there is no due process problem.

18

QUESTION:

Well, would you say that supposing the

19

judgment was entered, the defendant didn't even know about it,

20

and the plaintiff just let it sit there for, say, three years,

21

they just -- and then three years later they found out about it

22

and brought a proceeding to set it aside, would you say there

23

had been no impact on — no deprivation of property during that

24

three year period?

25

MR. URQUHART:

None caused by the inadequacies of the

remedy, particularly the inadequacies —
QUESTION:

2

Well,

I'm not saying whether it's without

due process.

property merely by virtue of the entry of a judgment which

5

remains on the official records of the county for three years?

6

Does that deprive anybody of property?
MR. URQUHART:

7
8

Not a void judgment. Your Honor.

No,

sir.
QUESTION:

9
10

The question is would there be a deprivation of

Although it's appealable here on the basis

that there has been a deprivation of property?
MR. URQUHART:

11

Your Honor, I will accept the Court's

12

statement on that.

13

earlier question as to why the Court has done that in other

14

cases, but I just cannot see the deprivation, perhaps because I

15

am,

16

I did not respond well to the Court's

from my side of the table, blind to it.
QUESTION:

I started off agreeing with you on that,

17

but I just can't explain why we entertain these suits then,

18

unless we are of the view that the mere entry of a void

19

judgment is a deprivation of property.

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Urquhart,

just so I can be sure I

23

understand what you're saying in response to all these

22

questions, if we assume that there is no other procedure at all

23

in Texas, other than the bill of review procedure, whereby the

24

judgment itself could be stricken as opposed to simply

25

preventing its enforcement, do you think there is a due process
36

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

violation or would be?
MR. URQUHART:

2
3

Not in this case, Your Honor, because

the judgment by -QUESTION:

4

Forget this case.

If there is no other

5

procedure under Texas law except the bill of review, for

6

setting aside a void judgment, without establishing a

7

meritorious defense, is there a due process problem violation?
MR. URQUHART:

8
9

30

My answer to that, Your Honor, is no,

because a void judgment does not constitute a taking of
property.
QUESTION:

11

But, then, you're saying, in effect, that

12

this judgment, which recites on its face that it was properly

13

served and is presumably on file and, you know, a title company

14

looking at that judgment isn't going to go back and interview

15

the people about whether the facts conform to what the record

16

shows, it seems to me that would really be a cloud on the

17

title.

18

MR. URQUHART:

But, Your Honor, isn't this really a

19

Paul v. Davis situation, where the most that can be said of a

20

void judgment is that it has an effect on the reputation alone?

21

It does not change the legal status.

22

QUESTION:

If you believe Shakespeare that he who

23

steals my purse steals trash, perhaps reputation is more

24

important than money, hut I should think this would be a real

25

impairment of one's property right.

I don't know what the

37

Texas law Is, but In Arizona, a recorded judgment was a lien

upon all of your real property.
MR, URQUHART:

Your Honor, a couple of responses to

5

in my respect, the Court is addressing here, we have asserted

6

in our brief was not properly raised below.
QUESTION:

7
8

9

That may be right, but how about the

property?
MR. URQUHART:

Your Honor, a void judgment, and here

10

I know that I'm being obnoxiously repetitive, but a void

31

judgment that has no legal effect under Texas law cannot

12

constitute a taking of property except for a pure reputational

13

interest, which, as I understand the Paul v. Davis case, states

14

is not a taking of liberty so as to invoke the due process,

15

QUESTION:

But how does anybody know it's void?

16

MR. URQUHART:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. URQUHART:

Well, —

If you look at the face of the judgment.
— Your Honor, since my brief has been

19

properly thrown at me, on page 6 of my opponent's brief, they

20

say that this judgment is -- pardon me.

21

on its face.

22
23

The citation is void

If that is true, as the Attorney General says, —

QUESTION:

Void on its face, but you have to accept

the allegation that he was never served.

MR. URQUHART:

outside the judgment that's on record to find out whether there

2

was -- whether it's void or not, whether there was service or

3

not.
MR. URQUHART:

4

But you can't do anything with it.

5

From our point of — from our side of the table, Your Honor, I

6

understand that side of the table's argument, but from our side

7

of the table, if we accept what they say could be true as we

8

must, then we have a void judgment that is not worth anything

9

to us.
QUESTION:

To clear title, it was, yes, sir.

20

MR. URQUHART:

21

QUESTION:

The deed record was transferred.

What about the lawyer who represented the

buyer?

Don't you suppose he relied on that judgment?

23

had been a lawyer for the buyer, wouldn't you have looked at

would have relied on it?

MR. URQUHART:

9

I suppose he must have charged the client

I wasn't representing him then, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Whoever represented — got that judgment

10

didn't think he was doing something for nothing or that the

11

judgment was utterly useless.

12

MR. URQUHART:

That is certainly true, Your Honor,

13

and we still contend the judgment is not useless, but for the

14

purpose of this argument, we are assuming that it's void.

15

Justice White, in your dissenting opinion in the

16

Gertz case, you stated that our constitutional, or words to

17

this effect, that our constitutional scheme demands a proper

18

respect for the roles of the state in discharging their

19

obligation to obey the Constitution.

20

I think that the State of Texas is entitled to that

21

respect in this case. The only thing that the Court of Appeals

22

and the Supreme Court did was to rule on the specific procedure

23

under which the Appellates tried to make a claim in this case,

24

a procedure that, Your Honor, expands the rights of victims of

25

default judgments rather than attempts to limit it in some form

This is a procedure that has been on the books of

Texas for a long time, and I think it's entitled to deference

in this case, particularly in light of the Mathewsv. Eldridge

for a state to say that a paper claim duly recorded after a

MR. SCHIMMEL:

20

Yes, sir,

I do.

Constitution of the United States mandates that if the issue is

one of lack of jurisdiction, that lack of jurisdiction is void

MR, SCHIMMEL:

2

Well,

fortunately, we didn't wait four

3

years.

Had we waited four years, then we would have had an

4

additional burden placed in front of us, and all of the

5

injunctive relief which the courts supposedly say that we can

6

have without citing one case, all that injunctive relief -- in

7

an injunctive proceeding, the burden is on us to go in and

prove that we have a right,

that we will ultimately win.

This is exactly the opposite statement that was made

by this Court in Armstrongy.Manzo.

will lose."

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Texas procedure?

2

MR. SCHIMMEL:

3

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Does Texas have a certification procedure

4

whereby if we were concerned about the question of state law,

5

we could certify the question to the Texas court?
MR. SCHIMMEL:

6

Do you know?

I am not familiar with that, sir.

7

do not know whether or not they do or do not have that

8

procedure.

9

I

No one has asked me to brief it, sir.
I would also like to close by stating Texas gives

10

great lip service in its cases to say that, in fact, you can

11

bring collateral attacks, yet not one of the collateral attacks

12

that has ever been brought and cited to you in these cases has

13

ever succeeded, except this one case that was improperly

14

decided, Commander v. Bryan, and even that case was not

15

appealed to the Supreme Court of the State of Texas, so it's

16

not stare decisis.

17

that did go to the Supreme Court of the State of Texas, McEwen

18

v._Harrison, where they said the exact opposite, and ultimately

19

its ultimate judgment shows the poverty of legal thinking in

20

that case because it says that you can attack a case over and

21

over and over again that's void on its face and have no res

22

judicata effect, which is entirely in opposite with Joiner v.

23

Vasquez, which was cert, denied by this Court and which the

24

Supreme Court of Texas said the exact opposite.

Also, it is a

subject matter jurisdiction case and not a personal

face that the Court had subject matter jurisdiction -- it did

10

not have subject matter jurisdiction.
The Attorney General of the State of Texas starts his

11
12

brief from a wrong point. He states that the face of this

13

judgment is void when, in fact, the face of the judgment is not

14

void.

15

recites that service was properly made.

16

The face of this judgment shows the exact opposite and

So, anything that is stated by the State of Texas

17

beyond that point, based upon that premise, cannot be correct,

18

and the cases that they cite to you, I would hold, simply are

19

not the law in the State of Texas, and the portion of their

20

case where they say you can bring a collateral attack has not

21

one case cited, has not one case cited, and this whole

22

procedure that we've gone through here, nobody on the

23

opposition or amicus has cited to this case where there has

24

been a collateral attack where the judgment comes from inside

25

the State of Texas, not from outside the State of Texas, where
46
