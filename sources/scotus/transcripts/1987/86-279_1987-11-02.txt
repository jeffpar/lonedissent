ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL W. STERNMAN, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. STERNMAN:

8
9

Justice Brennan and may it please the

Court.
Over the years, private claims for damages under

10
11

Section 10b have proliferated.

12

countless publicly held companies have been charged with wrong

13

doing.

14

positions, they often wonder whether the price they paid was

15

higher than it should have been, or the price that they

16

received was lower than it should have been.

17

At one time or another,

When investors find the market moving against their

Some, such as respondents in this case, elect to sue

18

to see whether any corporate wrong doing contributed to their

19

financial misfortune.

20

Essentially, respondents contend that three statements issued

21

by Basic were materially false and misleading insofar as they

22

claimed to have denied the existence of merger negotiations

23

when in fact merger negotiations were on going.

24
25

This case began in June, 1979.

The fact is that the statements at issue which are
the key to this case, as are the contacts between Basic and

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

4

1

C.E. but the statements did not themselves deny merger

2

negotiations in the sense that respondents claim.

3

statements, the first one issued in October, 1977, was issued

4

by the company because a rumor had been present in the

5

marketplace that Basic was having discussions with a company

6

called FlintKote.

7

foundation.

8

merger with FlintKote, and as a result, it properly issued a

9

prompt statement to deny that it was having any discussions

10

The three

Basic determined that that rumor had no

Whatever discussions it had were not leading to a

with FlintKote.
That statement says, the rumors as to FlintKote are

11
12

inaccurate and we're having no merger negotiations with

13

anybody.

14

The second and the third statements don't even refer

15

to merger negotiations.

They're issued in September, 1978, and

16

in November, 1978.

17

the company is unaware of any reasons for unusual trading

18

activity in its stock, and there are no corporate developments

19

that would account for it.

20

essentially an echo of the September statement and was issued

21

by the company in an effort to insure that its shareholders who

22

might not have seen the September statement which was part of a

23

press release would become aware of the substance of the

24

November statement which was included in a report to

25

shareholders.

The earlier statement is to the effect that

No, during this period, beginning even prior to the

2

first statement, Basic had been approached by an executive from

3

Combustion Engineering who had made very clear to Basic that he

4

had an interest in seeing whether a possible acquisition of

5

Basic could be made.

6

was very similar to the business that Basic was engaged in.

7

That was the refractories business.

8

9

Combustion had a line of business that

So, on four occasions between September, 1976 and the
issuance of the first statement in October, 1977, this

10

individual who would go to Cleveland, Ohio, at times to deal

11

with other businesses that Combustion had, would contact

12

representatives of Basic, would have lunch with them, and would

13

say, I'm interested in your company, I would like to see an

14

acquisition made, can we do something, are you interested.

15

The Basic representatives told him in no uncertain

16

terms that they were not interested, that they desired to

17

remain independent.

18

with this individual, but nothing came of it.

19

the October, 1977 statement was issued concerning the FlintKote

20

rumor, they had had only brief contact with this individual.

21

They were polite.

They did have lunch
And at the time

Similarly, in the period between October 1977 and

22

September 1978, they had only three more in-person visits by

23

Mr. Kelly who was the combustion engineering representative.

24

Significantly, two of those visits concerned an interest that

25

Basic had developed in acquiring the refractories division of

Basic decided that it might be of

And finally, in June, Basic

Mr. Kelly said no, but what if I were to suggest to

8

C.E. that it make an offer to acquire Basic for $28 a share.

9

The Basic individual said, we wouldn't be interested, but if we

10

were, that would be too low a price.

11

occasional telephone contacts during the balance of June and

12

July, 1978, and then Mr. Kelly stopped calling.

13

The individuals had

No word was heard from him during August or September

14

or October and November, with the exception of one brief

15

telephone call that he made in September when he became aware

16

as did the rest of the public that Basic had issued a statement

17

denying any knowledge of reasons for unusual trading activities

18

in its shares.

19

So it is an extreme claim to assert that statements

20

such as these issued by Basic in these circumstances were false

21

and misleading.

22

QUESTION:

Doesn't the SG suggest that a simple no­

23

comment would be all right, and that's the way to handle

24

inquiries of this kind?

25

MR. STERNMAN:

Heritage

Justice O'Connor, they have suggested

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

7
1

that.

I think the SEC has suggested it as well.

2

QUESTION:

And what's the matter with that?

3

MR. STERNMAN:

I think that it would do a disservice

4

to the investment community to encourage companies to say, no

5

comment, when in fact in good faith they determine that

6

whatever the market is doing with their stock has nothing to do

7

with anything that's going on with the company.

8

9

Judge Friendly in his concurring opinion in Texas
Gulf said that there would be a danger of encouraging corporate

10

silence if we with hindsight permitted Section 10(b) claims to

11

be brought against companies who in good faith attempt to

12

provide information to the marketplace.

13
14
15

16
17

A no comment response frequently is taken as an
indication that something is going on, in any event.
QUESTION:

Well, the Court of Appeals found that this

last statement at least was false when it was made.
MR. STERNMAN:

The Court of Appeals, although on

18

rehearing, I think one of the Judges on that panel indicated

19

that all they did was find that there were issues of fact that

20

precluded its affirming the summary judgment that the District

21

Court had awarded to petitioners, did seem to describe all of

22

the statements as false and misleading.

MR. STERNMAN:

We had presented the issue to it,

18

however, in three steps, as Rule 10(b)(5) permits us to.

19

first was that there was no issue of fact as to the accuracy of

the statements.

They were not false, they were not

might have been inaccurate -- and there is an issue of fact as

to that — they were not materially misleading because the

2

discussions between the companies had not progressed to the

3

point where they should be viewed as material information that

4

rendered the statements materially misleading.
And finally we also argued, and the District Judge

agreed, that there was no scienter here.

QUESTION:

MR. STERNMAN:

require that a few of the facts be developed.

the agreement in principle test is adopted, then it matters not

what the facts were because there's no question that at the

time, any of these statements were issued, there was not an

However, as Justice O'Connor indicated there are other tests

Those are undisputed facts in our view, and the Court

6

of Appeals glossed over them and created a scenario that made

7

it appear as if, at the same time Basic was issuing statements

8

in one room, it was sitting in another room with

9

representatives --

10
11

QUESTION:

Mr. Sternman, can I interrupt you for one

minute to see if I can understand your theory?

12

MR. STERNMAN:

13

QUESTION:

14

Yes, sir.

Drawing a distinction between materiality

on the one hand and truth on the other.

15

MR. STERNMAN:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

Assume for just purposes of discussion

17

that a statement was made that our management has never met, we

18

don't even know anybody at Combustion Engineering, a clearly

19

false statement, but one that was made before any agreement in

20

principle had been reached.

21

You'd say that was immaterial and not actionable?

22

MR. STERNMAN:

That's correct.

You can't have a

23

false statement that is not materially false and would not lead

24

to exposure to this kind of damage.

QUESTION:

So in order to judge this case in your

MR. STERNMAN:

principle test.
QUESTION:

If we accept your theory and we also agree

6

with you that at the time of these statements, the discussions

7

were sufficiently tentative not to satisfy the test, that's the

8

end of the case.

9
10

11
12

MR. STERNMAN:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

So we don't really have to worry about the

facts too much.
MR. STERNMAN:

That's correct.

But if instead of

13

accepting the agreement in principle test, you find more

14

attractive the test that the SEC has offered, its very

15

important to us to persuade you that the decision of the

16

District Court was correct, even under that test, that in

17

effect, the District Court's standard was foreshadowing the

18

SEC's standard that's now advocated.

19

QUESTION:

Well, if you take the SEC standard, that

20

isn't the standard the Court of Appeals used, either.

So I

21

would suppose you would state the right rule on remand without

22

dealing with the facts.

23

MR. STERNMAN:

Well, I think, as in Hochfelder where

24

this Court felt it was appropriate not to remand but instead to

25

give judgment to the respondents in that case because the

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

matter had been litigated long enough.
QUESTION:

3

You mean reinstate the District Court's

summary judgment?
MR. STERNMAN:

4

Yes.

I would as the Court that when

5

it remands to the Sixth Circuit, it do so with directions that

6

it reinstate that summary judgment order.

7

brought in June, 1979, and these issues have been fleshed out

8

between the parties for a very long time.

certainly under the agreement in principle test, they would

But if the Court were to adopt one of the

If we were to adopt the SEC test, that

15

would require a remand to the Court of Appeals because we'd

16

reject the Court of Appeals test, is that right?

17

MR. STERNMAN:

18

QUESTION:

19

Yes.

But I would hope the —

I know what you would hope, but that's a

fact, isn't it?

20

MR. STERNMAN:

21

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice Brennan, that's correct.

Do you think there's really that much

22

difference between the SEC's test and the Court of Appeal's

23

test?

24
25

MR. STERNMAN:

Yes.

The Court of Appeals test which

no one has defended simply states that when there is an

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

16
1

inaccuracy in a statement, it renders the undisclosed

2

information material.

3

brief, that removes the element of materiality completely from

4

the mix.

5

trivial statement.

6

there were but one telephone call from Kelly, that would be

7

sufficient.

8

And as the SEC notes in its amicus

And everything becomes material, even the most
I think the Court of Appeals stated if

It's interesting that it also read the statements as

9

if they were false statements.

10

QUESTION:

That would be sufficient to make it

11

untrue, but do you think that also under their view made it

12

sufficient to be material?

13

MR. STERNMAN:

Yes, that was their view.

14

Now, the other issue that is before the Court

15

involves the fraud on the market theory that has been used by

16

courts to facilitate class certification in actions under

17

Section 10(b).

18

Court has even approached anything that's come lower courts

19

feel relates to that theory is the Affiliated Ute case.

20

there is nothing in Affiliated Ute which involved a face to

21

face transaction and omissions, rather than misstatements, and

22

a need to shift an evidentiary burden, that provides any

23

justification for fraud on the market theory.

24
25

We have argued that the only case in which this

And

Lower courts, however, have concluded that it is good
policy to abandon the traditional reliance requirement under

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

17
1

Section 10(b) and instead to replace it with what they call

2

reliance on the integrity of the market, something that is

3

derived from the efficient market hypothesis, a hypothesis that

4

many people have questioned in light of the events of the last

5

few weeks.
But in a recent Fifth Circuit decision in the Finkel

6

7

case, they pointed out that even if you accept the fraud on the

8

market theory for some cases, you should not accept it for a

9

case such as ours, which is a 10(b)(5)(b) case, that is, a case

10

that involves misleading statements, rather than omissions.

11

To the extent this Court continues to believe that

12

Section 10(b) and Rule 10(b)(5) have their origins in a more

13

common law type fraud situation, the element of reliance has to

14

be respected and should be reinstated.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WAYNE A. CROSS, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. CROSS:

9
10
11

Justice Brennan, and may it please the

Court.
On August 10 of this year, Barron's magazine titled

12

its article about this case, "Is It Okay to Lie?" and I

13

hesitate to oversimplify in that kind of journalistic way, but

14

I really think that's what's at issue here.

15

notwithstanding the extensive discussion of the facts that the

16

petitioners seriously claim that the reasonable investor

17

articulated by this Court in TSC v. Northway, could not have

18

considered the discussions between Basic and Combustion

19

significant to their investment decisions.

20

I don't think

They try to minimize the extent of those contacts,

21

but the suggestion that a jury, there's not enough evidence of

22

those contacts that a jury could not conclude that a reasonable

23

investor would find it interesting, significant, alter the mix

24

of information available to them in deciding that a buyer sells

25

securities.

That is not a serious suggestion, I submit.

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

I

22

1

submit that what is really at issue in this case and at issue

2

in the agreement in principle articulation by the petitioners

3

is a statement that for reasons of corporate efficiency,

4

corporate ease, corporate convenience, companies are free to

5

say virtually anything they want to say about the state of

6

merger negotiations up until the time that there's an agreement

7

in principle, which means an agreement on price and structure.

8
9

In the practical world, agreement on price and
structure are typically reached the day the merger is

10

announced, perhaps the night before late at night.

11

the investment bankers sit down at the very last minute and

12

discuss price, go to their respective boards of directors with

13

a recommendations frequently in writing saying do it.

14

that point in time, you do not have what they call an agreement

20

We're not talking here about statements

21

The first statement issued in this case said no

22

negotiations were underway with any company for a merger.

23

That's as unambiguous as you can say it.

too?

what the Sixth Circuit said.

say. There is a reading of some of the language that says that.

21

I think the Sixth Circuit was saying that the TSC standard,

22

that a reasonable investor has to evaluate the information

23

available and I think they were saying in this case, the denial

made these statements material.

On balance, it's more credible that.
If you read the opinion carefully, there are dozens

of findings.

This is not a bench trial, this is a summary

4

QUESTION:

5

You think that the District Court found

6

that any of these statements were false and misleading, or did

7

they think that they weren't?

8

MR. CROSS:

9

I think the District Court concluded that

with respect to the first statement, there are not any

10

negotiations underway for any company for a merger statement,

11

that it concluded that the contacts prior to that statement

12

were not cognizable as "negotiations" and hence the statement

13

was true.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. CROSS:

16

Yes.
But that's a characterization of what is

a negotiation.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. CROSS:

How about the other statements?
The other statements, I believe, the

19

District Court conceded there was a possibility that the

20

contacts prior to the September, November statements could be

21

considered preliminary merger negotiations.

again that because they were preliminary, they were not

23

negotiations and then began to drift over into this agreement

25

deal being consummated, and because in his view the deal being

Heritage

It concluded once

Reporting Corporation
628-4888

(202)

27
1

consummated was determinative of materiality, they were not

2

untrue.
QUESTION:

3

Well, how about ordinary corporate

4

projections and forecasts in which the corporation says, well,

5

we think prospects look good or bad or whatever they say?

6

those statements might be of interest to investors, but courts

7

have not found that they are statements on which investors or

8

people who later sell or buy stock can use as the basis for a

9

suit.
Isn't that right?

10
11

Now,

They're deemed constructively

immaterial?
MR. CROSS:

12

Justice O'Connor, I think that's not

13

right.

14

particularly earnings projections which are speculative in

15

nature and uncertain, that there is no duty to disclose such

16

projections.

17

I think what those cases is that projections, and

QUESTION:

Well, then they are also I think you will

18

find that they are deemed constructively immaterial.

19

should a no corporate development statement such as these be

20

treated any differently than forecasts and projections?

21

MR. CROSS:

Why

Well, first of all, the no corporate

22

development statement is not as neutral as it sounds.

23

statement is taken from the New York Stock Exchange Manual, in

24

a section of the New York Stock Exchange Manual in which it

25

says when there are rumors of the possibility of a merger or

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

That

28
1

acquisition, it is necessary that corporate management speak

2

out definitively, clearly, and truthfully.

3

true, a statement that the company is aware of no pending or

4

present corporate development to explain the trading is

5

appropriate.

6

that it is not simply an analytical equivalent as suggested in

How about reliance?
Well, now you're shifting over into the

fraud on the market theory.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. CROSS:

But --

Just forge that.
In this particular case, I don't have a

24

problem with reliance because all three of our plaintiffs

25

testified that they'd read the documents and relied on them.

Heritage

In that particular case, our clients will take the stand and

The Class that was

certified here did not require reliance, isn't that right.
MR. CROSS:

13

The District Court, in certifying the

14

class, chose our second alternative articulation of a reason

15

for class certification, and said, in this case, fraud on the

16

market is sufficient to certify a class and certified it that

17

way.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. CROSS:

20

21

And that stood up in the Court of Appeals.
And that stood up in the Court of

Appeals.
In this case, I believe, given the certification that

22

was made, we do not have to affirmatively prove reliance.

23

have to defend the reliance presumption against the claims that

24

the fraud did not have an impact on the market, or its claims

We

members may have traded notwithstanding any impact on the

2

market, for example, they had to put their kids through school.
QUESTION:

3

Well, I gather from what you say, though,

4

you'd have no objection if we thought reliance had to be

5

established or claimed for the class?
MR. CROSS:

6

The only objection that I would have if

7

you thought that reliance had to be established would be the

8

right to relitigate the class action motion in the District

9

Court.

I would not like to be whipsawed between the District

10

Court who took one of two alternative theories and certified,

11

and a Supreme Court that says that theory was wrong, and leave

12

me without a class, which I think is a possibility in this

13

case.
I believe that the District Court could properly and

14
15

should properly have certified this class on traditional Rule

16

23 grounds that individual questions did not predominate.

17

while there may be some individual questions of reliance, they

18

were clearly subordinate to more significant questions of

19

liability, materiality, damages, all of which are common to the

class.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL W. STERNMAN, ESQ.

11

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS - REBUTTAL

12

MR. STERNMAN:

Thank you, Justice Brennan.

13

In many respects, this case represents hindsight run

14

rampant.

There was an agreement that was reached between Basic

15

and Combustion in December, 1978.

16

the time the agreement documents were publicized that the

17

companies had had discussions for the prior 27-month period.
This lawsuit followed.

18

There was disclosure that at

And the attempt to take the

19

fact that there was an agreement and that there had been

20

contacts during a 27-month period and then to convert that into

21

making three statements misleading does not stand up under the

22

record.

23

There was a reference by the respondents to there

24

being dozens of contacts before the first statement was issued.

25

In our reply brief, at pages 11 and 12, we identify each and

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

40
1

every meeting that the parties had during the class period.

2

And it comes to four meetings before the first statement, three

3

before the second statement and none before the third.

And we

4

describe those meetings.

It's a

5

distortion of the English language to call an attempt by an

6

executive of a company to see whether another company might be

7

interested negotiations that render statements false and

8

misleading.

These were not negotiations.

Second, we should make it clear that the District

9
10

Court did not require that there be a deal before the

11

statements would be materially misleading.

12

required was that there be negotiations destined with

13

reasonable certainty to become a merger agreement in principle,

14

or negotiations which might imminently produce an agreement in

15

principle.

All that it

16

It's our argument that at no point during the class

17

period did these contacts between Mr. Kelly and the people at

18

Basic ever approach the level of that definition, or approach

19

the level of the significantly increased possibility

20

formulation that the SEC has used.

21

Primarily, we advocate adoption by this Court of the

22

agreement in principle test.

It has been used over the years

23

by all of the lower courts in dealing with non-disclosure

24

cases.

2

The courts uniformly have held in those cases that that

3

information is not material and did not have to be disclosed.

4

And all that's happened in the Greenfield case is

5

that that Court has said that that test that courts have been

6

using for years in the non-disclosure area was an appropriate

7

one when a statement such as the statements here have been

issued.

line so that corporations that are the subject of a stock

The agreement in principle test also provides a bright

11

they do as Basic did here, seek to disclose accurate

12

information, that they will not be vulnerable to the type of

13

litigation that was brought here because it's going to be

14

claimed that there were issues of fact as to whether there were

15

material negotiations preceding.

16

There's been reference to the chilling effect.

That

17

is another policy benefit that the agreement in principle test

18

provides.

19

negotiations which traditionally have caused acquiring

20

corporations to leave, not to want to pursue a possible

21

acquisition because the price of the company stock increases

22

and there's no longer an economic benefit for the acquisition.

23

It will not require premature disclosure of

Premature disclosure under a test other than the

24

25

and employee morale at companies.
