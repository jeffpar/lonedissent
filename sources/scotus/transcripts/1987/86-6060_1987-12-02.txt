ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID I. BRUCK

4

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. BRUCK:

5
6

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court.
The question in this case is whether a State in a

7
8

refusal to give retroactive effect to this Court's decision in

9

Francis v. Franklin to cases which were final on direct appeal

10

when Francis was decided.
As in any retroactivity case, I think it may be

11

12

helpful to review a little of the procedural history that got

13

us to this question.

14

convicted of murder in 1981, two years after this Court's

15

decision in Sandstrom v. Montana.

16

late 1982.

Petitioner Dale Yates was tried and

His appeal was decided in

17

No objection was raised at trial or on appeal to the

18

unconstitutional jury instruction which is at the core of this

19

case.

20

Carolina law under a very very well established line of South

21

Carolina case.

22

However, that creates no procedural bar under South

Indeed, in his direct appeal opinion, the Court said

23

that it reviewed the entire record of Mr. Yates' trial in

24

favorem vitae as is South Carolina Supreme Court's invariable

25

practice in capital cases alone.

Heritage

It has a rather strict

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

4

1

procedural default rule in non-capital cases, but it has no

2

such rule in capital cases.

3

no prejudicial error.

4

And the Court said that it found

A little less than a year later, the South Carolina

5

Supreme Court, for the first time, sustained a Sandstrom

6

challenge to a series of burden shifting jury instructions

7

involving the essential element of malice, which is an

8

essential element of murder under South Carolina law.

9

The first of those decisions in 1983 was a case

10

called State v. Elmore.

11

a habeas corpus petition in the original jurisdiction of the

12

State Supreme Court alleging that the jury instructions in his

13

case which I think we all agree were materially identical to

14

those involved in Elmore, created -- and I quote — "an

15

unconstitutional burden shifting presumption of malice."

16

alleged that it created a mandatory rebuttable presumption of

17

malice, and he cited Sandstrom v. Montana as authority for that

18

proposition.

19

case, State v. Woods that had also applied Sandstrom to strike

20

down the same instructions, the South Carolina Supreme Court

21

should apply its own decisions and uphold his constitutional

22

claim.

23

A few months after Elmore, Yates filed

He

He also said that in light of Elmore and another

The State responded, by the way, to this original

24

petition by saying that they agreed that his petition should be

25

consolidated with another appeal then before the State Supreme

Reporting Corporation

Court to resolve the apparent issues.

2

the State of South Carolina, argued on the merits of the

3

constitutional claim that in fact it was not a bad jury-

4

instruction, and presented exclusively Federal authority saying

5

that the instruction could be distinguished from that involved

6

in Sandstrom.

7

However, the respondent,

While his petition was pending, this Court decided

8

Francis v. Franklin.

9

the State Supreme Court and said that Francis was absolutely on

10
11

Yates submitted the Francis decision to

all fours, and required reversal.
About three weeks after it got the Francis decision,

12

the State Court said that it had in a per curiam decision

13

without opinion said that it had considered the petition for

14

habeas corpus and concluded that it should be denied.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. BRUCK:

17
18

It did not cite Francis?
It cited nothing.

What I recited is

exactly the words that the State Court used.
Yates then petitioned this Court for certiorari and

19

this Court granted certiorari and remanded to the South

20

Carolina Supreme Court for reconsideration in light of Francis

21

v. Franklin.

22

On remand, the judgement occurred which is the

23

subject of this matter here today.

24

opinion on remand begins by acknowledging in the first breath

25

that the constitutional error involved here is a violation of

Heritage

Reporting

The State Supreme Court's

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

6

1

Francis v. Franklin.

The way the Court put it was that the

2

instructions here violated the principals of State v. Elmore,

3

and involved the same infirmities as those addressed by the

4

United States Supreme Court in Francis.
But immediately after saying that, the State Supreme

5
6

Court then said, so the question before us is the retroactivity

7

of State v. Elmore, completely ignoring the fact that it had

8

just finished conceding, or acknowledging that this was a

9

Federal Constitutional error that had been committed in the

10

case.
The Court then said that retroactivity — taking a

11
12

couple of lines out of this Court's retroactivity doctrine

13

which the State Court apparently misinterpreted to mean that

14

the retroactivity of constitutional decisions is entirely a

15

matter of State law, and then proceeded to say that they found

16

the view expressed by Justice Harlan in Desist and Mackey to be

17

persuasive, and therefore the Court would, as a matter of its

18

own State law, not apply the doctrine condemning mandatory

19

rebuttable presumptions, an essential element of the offense.
QUESTION:

20

Well, Mr. Bruck, if the South Carolina

21

Supreme Court does not discriminate against Federal claims,

22

does this Court have authority to tell that Court what

23

retroactivity law to apply in a State habeas proceeding to you

24

suppose?

25

MR. BRUCK:

The difficulty is that the claim is a

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

7

1

Federal one.

2

Federal Constitutional decisions is a matter of Federal

3

constitutional law.

4

discriminating against that whole body of this Court's

5

constitutional doctrine, when it said that we are simply not

6

going to apply it.

7

I think the answer is, yes.

The retroactivity of

And the State Court, in effect, was

The crucial thing to stress here is that this is not

8

—. no matter how much the State attempts now to recast this

9

matter — is not a case involving a State's construction of its

10

own post-conviction remedy.

11

It would not have made a nickel's worth of difference whether

12

Dale Yates had raised his claim on direct appeal, had raised it

13

at trial, had raised it all along.

14

denied relief prior to its own final rather belated

15

acknowledgment of the principles of Sandstrom in the Elmore

16

decision, they would have come up with exactly the same

17

decision if Yates had then later renewed his claim after he

18

noticed that the State Supreme Court had begun to apply

19

Sandstrom.

20

That is not what happened here.

If the State Court had

And I think the proof of that is in another line of

21

South Carolina retroactivity decisions led by Truesdale v.

22

Aiken, a case involving what the South Carolina Supreme Court

23

believed to be a question involving the retroactivity of this

24

Court's decision in Skipper v. South Carolina.

25

Truesdale, the petitioner in Truesdale had raised his Skipper

Heritage

Corporation

628-4888

And in

8
1

claim well before Skipper on direct appeal.

It met with no

2

success.

3

the State Court came up with a decision very very similar -- a

4

little short of it, but essentially the same decision as is

5

involved in this case, saying that they again have decided to

6

apply Skipper only on direct appeal and that they're adopting

7

in effect the Justice Harlan view in collateral review.

He then raised it again on post-conviction relief and

This Court summarily reversed, I think correctly, I

8
9

believe, recognizing that the retroactivity, as I say, of a

10

Federal constitutional decision is not a matter that States

11

have the authority to pick and choose.

12

there's any discrimination between one sort of Federal claim

13

and another, but simply that South Carolina has misinterpreted

14

the Federal nature of the constitutional law.

15
16

QUESTION:
Harlan view?

So we don't say that

What if this Court were to adopt the

MR. BRUCK:

Not in this case because there is no

MR. BRUCK:

If you disagree with me on that and

2

decide to jettison the last 24 years of retroactivity and to

3

jettison the Stovall, no, I don't believe so.

4
5

QUESTION:

As we have already jettisoned a

considerable part of it on the other side on direct appeal.

6

MR. BRUCK:

7

No, I don't believe so, because I think that as

Yes.

8

Francis, itself described the constitutional principle involved

9

here as an axiomatic fundamental bedrock principle of due

10

process that no one may be imprisoned, or in this instance,

11

executed without having the State born its burden of proving

12

his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

13

So we are dealing I think with something —

14

QUESTION:

15

things that had been regularly going on.

16

MR. BRUCK:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Francis certainly changed an awful lot of

Well, that's true.
An awful lot of people didn't understand

what bedrock due process was before Francis.
MR. BRUCK:

Well, apparently so.

There have been a

20

number of States that have been giving these instructions.

21

that as it may, that was the Court's holding, and I certainly

22

think that we are dealing in Francis v. Franklin with a

23

constitutional issue that is very close to the core of our

24

basic of due process.

25

QUESTION:

Be

Well, what if the Supreme Court of South

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

10

1

Carolina had said in connection with its own State habeas that

2

we're not going to entertain any challenges that go to jury

3

instructions.

4

going to consider on collateral attack and we don't care

5

whether they're State challenges or Federal challenges.

6

the Supreme Court of South Carolina had decided this case on

7

that basis.

8

9

That's just the kind of thing that we're not

And

Do you think that you would have a Federal question
to preserve here?

10

MR. BRUCK:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. BRUCK:

No.

Of course, that's not what they did.

I realize that.
I don't quarrel at all with the

13

proposition that a State can limit its Federal remedy.

14

course that would not create under the circumstances of this

15

case that would not create any sort of a Wainwriqht v. Sikes

16

bar down the line.

17

QUESTION:

Now, of

No, but it would mean in their own State

18

collateral review, they would not have to decide any claim,

19

Federal or State, based on a jury instruction.

20
21

MR. BRUCK:

I have not thought about that, but I'm

inclined to think that they could have done it.

22

QUESTION:

23

So a State can circumscribe in some respects the kind

24
25

I realize that is not what they did.

of claims it's going to consider on collateral review.
QUESTION:

Of course some answer to that question may

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

11
1

be indicated by the fact that we chiefly relied on Francis.

2

Isn't that what we did in this case?

3

MR. BRUCK:

Yes, sir.

Absolutely.

The South

4

Carolina Supreme Court was instructed to reconsider this case

5

in light of Francis v. Franklin.

6

absolutely no state procedural doctrine in South Carolina

7

whatsoever that shuts the door on one procedural category of

8

claims and not on others.

9

And of course, there is

I realize the State has tried to identify some defect

10

in the initial habeas proceeding papers.

11

that really needs to be responded to.

12

that claim is renewed today, I may touch on it in reply.

13

I don't know that

Perhaps, if need be if

But suffice it to say that I think the basic error

14

that the State Court committed when they got this case on

15

remand was their failure to recognize that there is a threshold

16

test in any retroactivity case that must be addressed.

17

that is whether or not you are dealing with a new decision.

18

And I don't think there are very many cases in which this Court

19

more clearly indicated -- and I realize there was disagreement

20

within the Court — but the majority of the opinion of the

21

Court clearly held that Francis v. Franklin simply applied one

22

of the alternate holdings of Sandstrom v. Montana.

23

And

Some of the proof of how not new a decision in

24

Francis was is that South Carolina had in other contexts, and

25

with other instructions, already applied this very portion of

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

12

1

Sandstrom.

And indeed, State against Elmore was an application

2

of the principles of Francis before Francis was decided.

3

Everything they needed to have applied Francis they could have

4

gotten, and did get out of Sandstrom v. Montana.
So where a retroactivity issue came from in this case

5
6

is something which I'm still struggling from the State's

7

opinion to understand.

8
9

Of course, when we apply the Stovall factors,
assuming that the Court is not inclined to use this case to

10

reconsider the viability of the Stovall retroactivity doctrine-,

11

it's rather clear that this Francis v. Franklin or Sandstrom v.

12

Montana, whatever principles one wishes to label them as,

13

follow very clearly on the retroactive application side of the

14

Stovall factors.
First and foremost, we consider the purpose of the

15
16

rule.

17

bears its burden of proof and that only the guilty are

18

convicted and the innocent are acquitted.

19

heart of the truth seeking function in criminal trials, as this

20

Court very clearly stressed in Francis.

21

And the purpose of this rule is to insure that the State

That is at the very

At that point, the second two factors under this

22

Court's cases really fall out of the picture.

23

look at them,

24

Sandstrom v. Montana, and really after Mullaney v. Wilbur in

25

1975, there could have been no justifiable reliance on any

But even if we

justifiable reliance on the old rule, after

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

13

1

notion that States were entitled to shift the burden of

2

persuasion on an essential element of an offense.
QUESTION:

3

How about the Patterson case?

I mean,

4

certainly that indicated that Mullaney should not be construed

5

as broadly as it might have been.

6

sharply on Mullaney.

7

onward and upward as you would suggest.
MR. BRUCK:

8
9

In fact, it cut back rather

So it wasn't just one great big progress

Well, yes, that's true.

But Patterson

nevertheless it used an analysis of the elements test.

It

10

focused on what the elements of the crime were.

11

certainly malice is an element of murder and no one could have

12

read Patterson to think that it is justifiable to shift the

13

burden of persuasion on the element of malice under South

14

Carolina law.

15

And here,

In any event, Sandstrom v. Montana which followed

16

Patterson could not really have been much clearer on this

17

point, although the instructions are probably most easily read

18

in Sandstrom as a conclusive presumption.

19

doubt, and the Court said whether it be conclusive of whether

20

it be mandatorily rebuttable, it is no less unconstitutional.

21

That was two years before this person's trial, three years

22

before his direct appeal.

23

conceivable justifiable reliance on any prior rule, State or

24

Federal.

25

That issue was in

And there could not be any

Finally, we have impact on the administration of

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

628-4888

14

justice.

The impact in this case is truly negligible.

South

2

Carolina naturally is concerned about applying rules to cases

3

which are already final, but I would stress that South Carolina

4

has an extremely rigid system of procedural default in all but

5

capital cases.

6

properly litigate it both at trial and on direct appeal, there

7

is no interest of justice exception, there is no fundamental

8

error exception under 9 Capital South Carolina criminal law so

9

there are very very few cases in the pipeline.

So that anyone who didn't raise this and

And in any event, there is no right for South

10
11

Carolina now to be able to claim that that's a valid factor to

12

consider.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

You would say that Francis -- any Francis-

type case would be foreshadowed by Sandstrom?
MR. BRUCK:

Yes, sir.

I would think, any.

The Court

16

simply denied in Francis there was any new law being made.

17

was simply an instruction which was clearly of the mandatory

18

rebuttable type.

19

QUESTION:

It

Well, the Court said in Francis that such

20

inferences, permissive inferences do not necessarily implicate

21

the concerns of Sandstrom.

22

MR. BRUCK:

Yes.

The problem is here that South

23

CArolina itself, as our State Supreme Court has recognized over

24

and over again, is that we're not dealing with a permissive

25

inference but rather with a mandatory rebuttable presumption.

2

Malice is presumed from x, y, and z facts.
QUESTION:

Well, why has the case been discussed in

3

the South Carolina Courts as if it's the retroactivity of

4

Francis v. Franklin rather than the retroactivity of Sandstrom?

5

MR. BRUCK:

Well, there'd be no issue of

6

retroactivity of Sandstrom because Sandstrom occurred two years

7

before this man's trial.

8

issue is frankly a mystery to me.

The bubbling up of this retroactivity
The petitioner did ask the

10

Sandstrom retroactively.

11

way of putting the matter, but we also made clear the Federal

12

constitutional character of the claim in the habeas papers.

13

We thought it simply the most tactful

But I confess to complete bewilderment as to how this

14

case became a retroactivity case when there is new law to be

15

applied by the State Supreme Court.

16

happened in this case is that we have a State Supreme Court

17

which simply has denied that the retroactivity or that the

18

obligation -- whether you call it retroactivity or not -- the

19

obligation of a State court to apply Federal law in its courts,

20

whether it be civil, criminal, post-conviction, or direct

21

appeal, is a matter of Federal, not State law.

22

where we got.off onto this — South Carolina Supreme Court on

23

remand — onto this tangent.

Clearly, what has somehow

And that's

24

The State argues beyond the retroactivity issue, the

25

State puts a great deal of effort in their brief to argue that

in fact this isn't such a bad instruction and that it is not an

2

unconstitutional instruction.

pressed over and over again without success.

5

Fourth Circuit in Hyman v. Aiken, a Federal habeas case from

6

which the State has not sought review in this Court.

7

This is a claim which it has
In the South

It is really a matter which is all but settled, and

8

for the reasons set forth in our brief, I would suggest that

9

the South Carolina Supreme Court and the Fourth Circuit have

10

correctly identified the constitutional infirmity of both of

11

the malice instructions at issue here.

12

that the State's position has any merit on that score.

13

And don't really feel

They also argue that this Court ought to make the

14

first determination of whether the error was harmless.

15

argued at some length in the Reply Brief that in view of both

16

of the two theories of prosecution that were used in this case

17

and applying South Carolina law and the particular form of the

18

law of parties in accomplice liability under South Carolina

19

law, that the States harmless error argument has no merit.

20

I've

I would simply stress here that this again was

21

pressed vigorously before the South Carolina Supreme Court.

22

The South Carolina Supreme Court did not expressly reject the

23

harmless error argument, but I should think that if under South

24

Carolina law and under the facts of this case, the South

25

Carolina Court had seen merit in the harmless error argument,

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

17
1

it is most unlikely that they would have gone off into the area

2

of retroactivity.
QUESTION:

3
4

I think that's probably true.

But why

should we get into doing harmless error analysis here?

5

MR. BRUCK:

6

QUESTION:

I'm sorry, why should you?
Yes, why should we, you know, if we agree

7

with you on the rest, why shouldn't we just remand and give

8

them a chance to determine whether they think it was harmless

9

or not?

10

MR. BRUCK:.

That would suit me fine.

I really think

11

that is certainly what this Court's precedents envision I think

12

in almost every situation, even the very case in which you held

13

that there could be harmless error under Francis v. Franklin,

14

you then remanded to the Federal Court in habeas to allow that

15

determination to be made.

16

the most reasonable way to proceed in this case.

And that certainly would seem to be

17

I think South Carolina when the case is remanded will

18

grant this person a new trial, but that is between us and them.

19
20

If there are no further questions, I would like to
save some time in rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD JOHN ZELENKA

2

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. ZELENKA:

3
4

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court.

5

We submit that the question before this Court is

6

whether a State Court has the ability in collateral review

7

proceedings to establish its own procedures and develop how it

8

is going to review new case law precedent arising out of its

9

own Court and other courts.

10

We submit that in this situation, the retroactive

11

application is not compelled, either constitutionally or

12

the limits of the type of review it would give in State habeas

We contend that it was

In that situation, a somewhat unique situation that

17

was presented before this Court, it said it would only look at

18

certain situations and those situations were if the trial court

that entered the conviction lacked subject matter jurisdiction

over that situation, and secondly, if the criminal conduct

21

involved in the case was not subject to criminal sanction.

QUESTION:

Mr. Zelenka, explain to me why the Court

chose not to consider Francis v. Franklin on the remand?
MR. ZELENKA:

It would appear that they did decide

that essentially on the facts by that one sentence that they

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

19

had when they held that this charge was similar to the charge

2

addressed in State v. Elmore and similar to the charges

3

addressed in Francis v. Franklin.

However, I would submit that

4

QUESTION:

5

What does that mean?

I don't understand.

6

What do you think they decided with regard to Francis v.

7

Franklin?
MR. ZELENKA:

8

What I think they decided was the

9

limitations of the type of relief and the type of review they

10

would give in State habeas corpus proceedings in its original

11

jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

12
13

Well, is it a decision just not to

consider Federal claims?
MR. ZELENKA:

14

No, it's a decision only to consider

15

those claims that hold that the trial court's jurisdiction was

16

null and void or that the particular conduct involved was not

17

subject to criminal sanctions in the case.

18

falls outside of those decisions, then it will not consider

19

those retroactively in its original jurisdiction in these

20

matters.

21

If any decision

Mr. Bruck has argued somewhat convincingly, I would

2

submit,' that in favorem vitae review applies in this case and

3

in any capital case in South Carolina.

4

those cases would reveal that they're talking about the direct

5

appeal situation where they have a much broader review.

But a close reading of

There is no case in South Carolina that sets out the

6
7

proposition that in favorem vitae review does exist in State

8

collateral proceedings either under the Uniform Post-Conviction

9

Relief Act, or under the habeas procedures in its original

10

writ.

11

is not a substitute for an appeal.

12

We cited the case of Tyler v. State which says that it

So when the Court had this matter before it, they had

13

a situation that was not raised on direct appeal, was not

14

objected to on direct appeal in a case that occurred two years

15

after the Sandstrom v.Montana decision came down, which the

16

petitioner argues set the bedrock precedent for this case.

17

Subsequent to the appeal in this decision, the South

18

Carolina Supreme Court did hold that under a very similar

19

charge to the charge in this case, that they held as a matter

20

of State law that it violated the Constitution.

21

QUESTION:

If you're right, Mr. Zelenka, why does the

.2 2

Supreme Court's opinion in this case discuss retroactivity so

23

elaborately?

24
25

MR. ZELENKA:

It discussed retroactivity to the

extent that they considered the retroactivity of State v.

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

21

1

Elmore and whether State v. Elmore was essentially a decision

2

that applied new law or applied something that could have been

3

presented previously to it under more timely procedures.

4
5
6

QUESTION:

Didn't they also consider whether Francis

v. Franklin should be applied retroactively?
MR. ZELENKA:

I think implicitly in that decision has

7

to come from the Supreme Court's decision that they held that

8

it did not apply retroactively to this decision.

9
10
11

QUESTION:

That's a holding really on Federal

constitutional law, isn't it?
MR. ZELENKA:

It's a holding on Federal

12

constitutional law to the extent that they looked at whether

13

those procedures, or that issue, that claim could be presented

14

to it at that time.

15

State procedural law because it did not hold that particular

16

criminal conduct to have divested the trial court of

17

jurisdiction or held a criminal conduct to be not --

18

QUESTION:

And they held it could not under their own

So you're saying when they're talking

19

about retroactivity, they're saying that only if a new decision

20

divests the Court of jurisdiction or makes the conduct not

21

criminal will the Supreme Court of South Carolina consider it?

22

MR. ZELENKA:

Only in those two situations, according

23

to this decision, they would consider it.

24

other situation, the retroactivity issue will not be considered

25

unless it was properly presented in a State post-conviction

Now, the South Carolina Supreme Court allows in State

QUESTION:

Implicitly?

MR. ZELENKA:

the Francis v. Franklin issue under the procedures that it had

This is actually one of the first —

This is at that time one of the first

MR. ZELENKA:

For their own procedures.

And they

clearly state throughout this decision that they're looking at

the retroactivity of State Court decisions.
QUESTION:

12

But of course, did they think that this

Elmore was decided after the trial in

this case, but before the State post-conviction relief review,

2

and a Woods case was held subsequent and during the State post­

3

conviction relief review and then he petitioned at that third

4

stage while the State post-conviction relief review was pending

5

on appeal to ask this Court in its original jurisdiction to

6

look at the State v. Elmore case and apply that retroactively.

7

We would submit that that unique situation that he

8

was looking for.

9

we are seeking the ability to argue the applicability of State

In fact, in his petition itself he is saying,

10

v. Elmore and State -v. Woods to this factual situation.

The

11

South Carolina Supreme Court denied both times to apply it to

12

this situation.
He's asserting that there is in favorem vitae review

13
14

in the South Carolina decisions at any stage during the

15

proceedings.

16

clearly stands for the proposition that under South Carolina

17

law, in favorem vitae review does not exist at all proceedings,

18

because they acknowledge in this case that the jury charges in

19

State v. Elmore were similar to those that were found in

21

were similar to those found in violation in State v. Elmore.

Now,

25
1

MR. ZELENKA:

2

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

And that case had an instruction identical

3

with Francis against Franklin, I mean, for all purposes, this

4

Court assumed that it was the same, did it not, your State

5

Supreme Court?

6

MR. ZELENKA:

7

QUESTION:

Similar to it.

So that when they held the instruction bad

in the Elmore case, they were not relying on Franklin, because

9

it hadn't been decided?

10

MR. ZELENKA:

11

QUESTION:

12

No, sir.

So they must have been relying on

Sandstrom against Montana, is that right?
MR. ZELENKA:

Well, they could have been relying on

Sandstrom v. Montana.

15

Or they could have been relying on their own State

MR. ZELENKA:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. ZELENKA:

It did not.

I see.

There was a case that preceded that,

22

State v. Madison, where they held there was a jury charge

It would apply in

QUESTION:

5

MR. ZELENKA:

Any collateral?

that the Court did not have jurisdiction over him, or a

situation where he was charged with criminal conduct that

8

subsequently was determined not to be criminal conduct.

9
10

QUESTION:

And those are the only bases on which you

can collaterally attack a judgment on habeas in South Carolina?
MR. ZELENKA:

11

No, sir.

In State habeas under this

decision, that would be it, but under collateral review, they

13

have much broader abilities to do challenges under Sixth

16

QUESTION:

17

Why is this decision different from all others?

different procedural mode than the normal collateral review

Those matters should necessarily then be brought under

QUESTION:

Then are you also saying, assume you

prevail in this Court on the theory that you espouse, that this

12

particular petitioner should go back to South Carolina and

13

invoke the Uniform Post-Conviction Relief Act before he would

14

have exhausted his State remedies?

15

MR. ZELENKA:

The problem with his attempt to invoke

16

the Uniform Post-Conviction Relief Act is that he is probably

17

procedurally barred because South Carolina has, under Rule 50

18

of the Supreme Court Rules, a successive application.

19

QUESTION:

So you're saying that is not actually an

available remedy at this time?

21

MR. ZELENKA:

QUESTION:

23

25

That would not be an available remedy.

And it also was not an available remedy at

the time of the decision we're reviewing now?
MR. ZELENKA:

conviction relief appeal.

And he also had counsel in the State

10

post-conviction relief proceedings when he raised a Sixth

11

Amendment challenge based upon a closing argument of a

12

solicitor that was similar to the Thompson v. Aiken argument

13

and the South Carolina Supreme Court implicitly rejected that

14

with a denial of the certiorari petition done pursuant to Rule

15

50 of the South Carolina Supreme Court rules.

16

We would submit that the South Carolina Courts have

17

the ability to fashion the types of relief that it is going to

18

give and fashion the types of procedures that it's going to

19

give in those situations, as long as it does not discriminate

20

in those claims that are presented to it.,

21

In this situation, we submit that the South Carolina

22

Court established its own common law and that they were not

23

going to look at the issues as presented in Elmore similar to

24

the issues as presented in this case in its original

25

jurisdiction.

Further, we would submit that the South Carolina

QUESTION:

Under the theory that they were

retroactive?
MR. ZELENKA:

On the theory that they were

5

retroactive.

But in addition, we would submit that because it

6

was a sense of a procedural bar because of the situation in

7

Elmore that if it was a Sandstrom issue as he urged in that

8

particular case that that issue could have been raised

9

previously.

10

QUESTION:

Where is that?

11

MR. ZELENKA:

It's not within the decision.

That was

12

within his argument that he made before the South Carolina

13

Supreme Court.

14

We would further submit that the jury charges in this

15

particular case did not violate Francis v. Franklin in that

16

they did not, when closely viewed, shift any burden of proof on

17

any of the particular elements of the crime.

18

first a definition of the sense of malice that it is the doing

19

of an unlawful act without just cause or excuse, and second

20

that malice is implied or presumed from use of a deadly weapon

21

is really no presumption at all because it was followed

22

immediately by the sentence that said, when all the facts and

23

circumstances are presented surrounding the use of the weapon,

24

that presumption is removed, and ultimately is for the jury to

25

determine under all the facts and circumstances of the case

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

It was merely

Corporation

628-4888

37
1

whether in fact malice existed in the heart and mind of the

2

killer.

3

We would further submit that this case does present a

4

situation where there was harmless error.

Now while we

5

understand that the proceedings that are before the Court does

6

not mandate this Court to determine harmless error, we think

7

that if the State of South Carolina and the South Carolina

8

Supreme Court was in error in this particular order, that a

9

remand would be appropriate for the Court to determine the

10

issue of harmless of error. -

But we think the facts and

11

circumstances of this case, as we have briefed, support a

12

conclusion that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable

13

doubt.

14

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID I. BRUCK

18

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

19

MR. BRUCK:

20

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Zelenka.

If I might just briefly answer -Let me ask you one question if I may.

21

Just glancing through the opinion of the Supreme Court of South

22

Carolina on direct appeal in 1982, it gives no intimation that

23

any challenge to this jury instruction was made on direct

24

appeal.

25

Is that correct?

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

38

MR. BRUCK:

1

That is correct, there was none.

2

Appointed trial counsel handled the trial and the direct

3

appeal, and the trial court post-conviction relief proceedings,

4

all the same court appointed lawyer.
QUESTION:

5

What business was there raising it in the

6

proceeding in this case?

7

habeas ?

MR. BRUCK:

QUESTION:

MR. BRUCK:

Wasn't that it was an original

-- original habeas jurisdiction of the

11

South Carolina Supreme Court at the same time as the post

12

conviction appeal was being heard.

13

that they did not object to consolidating the two cases for the

14

purpose of, and I quote, "resolving the apparent issues."

QUESTION:

The State's response was

What was raised in that State collateral

proceeding?
MR. BRUCK:

The primary issue was improper jury

argument which was also a matter which could have been raised.
QUESTION:

When was the Sandstrom Francis instruction

issue first raised anywhere in the South Carolina courts?
MR. BRUCK:

It was first raised in the original

jurisdiction of the State Supreme Court in January, 1985.
QUESTION:

And I take it that the suggestion is that

that claim was procedurally barred?

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

39
MR. BRUCK:

1

That is not a suggestion that can fairly

2

be made on any basis in South Carolina law.

3

the State's unsuccessful argument to convince the State Supreme

4

Court to create a procedural bar.

There is none.

South Carolina has made the reasoned judgment that in

What that is is

capital cases --

7

QUESTION:

And I suppose that if there had been a

8

procedural bar, the opinion in this case, they wouldn't have

9

needed to go to all the trouble of writing an opinion in this

10

case.

They could have just said, procedurally barred.
MR. BRUCK:

11

Absolutely.

But the South Carolina

12

Supreme Court would not do that because that is not the law.

13

It has not ever been the law.

authority.

brief.

The authority on the other side is a case called

Thompson v. Aiken, a trial arising in the very same

courtroom as this one did, involved an improper jury argument

by a solicitor which was not raised on direct appeal, it was

not objected to at trial, on post-conviction relief, the

23

petitioner filed a collateral attack, raising for the first

24

time, the solicitor's improper jury argument, it was rejected

25

at the trial court level, and on appeal, the South Carolina

1

Supreme Court granted relief, reversed, said that in effect, we

2

missed it on the first go around but we have subsequently-

3

decided in other cases that these arguments are improper.

4

cannot distinguish the argument here from the argument there.

5

Therefore, this man is entitled to a new sentencing hearing.

6

The Thompson v. Aiken, I think totally disposes of

7

this whole nest of procedural arguments which South Carolina

8

has raised without success below, and now tries to renew here.
QUESTION:

9

Well, what about what it says up here that

10

.this kind of State habeas proceeding is limited to the two

11

little circumstances that are mentioned by Mr. Zelenka?
MR. BRUCK:

12

We

I think it is only the State's brief that

13

says that.

14

opinion, and the part of the opinion that Mr. Zelenka read to

15

Justice Scalia as the Justice pointed out dealt only with

16

retroactivity.

17

The State Supreme Court never said so in its

QUESTION:

On page 34 of the Joint Appendix if I'm

18

reading where I think Justice O'Connor was referring to, it

19

says, collateral attack of a criminal conviction on the basis

20

of legal precedent that developed after the conviction became

21

final must be reserved for those cases iin which the trial

22

court's action was without jurisdiction, or is void because the

23

defendant's conduct is not subject to criminal sanction.

24
25

Now, that's the majority opini-on of the Supreme Court
of South Carolina.

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

41

MR. BRUCK:

1

Yes, it is.

Yes, it is.

That, again, by

2

its terms applies only to retroactivity.

3

was not the law the Court applied in Thompson v. Aiken.

4

they applied their own precedents retroactively, it seems that

5

they have reserved this doctrine specially for Francis v.

6

Franklin.

7

QUESTION:

In any event, that

Are you saying that the law in South

8

Carolina has changed since September 29, 1986, when this

9

opinion issued?
MR. BRUCK:

10

Since

No, I'm not.

What this is is a

11

retroactivity holding and they have not changed the scope.

12

This only kicks in once they identify some new legal doctrine

13

by its very terms on the basis of legal precedent that

14

developed after the conviction became final.
If the precedent had been there all along, and it was

15
16

in this case, this claim would be cognizable under South

17

Carolina law even though it was raised for the first time on

18

collateral review.

19

Carolina.
QUESTION:

20
21

MR. BRUCK:

23

QUESTION:

25

Would it be cognizable in this form of

State habeas proceeding do you think?

22

24

That is a well settled principle in South

There is no reason to believe otherwise.
Despite its language saying it wouldn't

be?
MR. BRUCK:

When they are speaking of collateral

attack, they are referring equally to habeas and to the

proceedings brought under the statutory procedure, the Uniform

Those terms have been used interchangeably.

would not apply Elmore retroactively was a statutory Uniform

7

distinction.

8

They have drawn no

Truesdale v. Aiken, the Skipper case that this Court

summarily reversed, that was a Uniform Post-Conviction Relief

10

it had been raised on direct appeal, it had been raised at the

trial level in collateral attack, and there was never a habeas

The distinction that the State has attempted to

arguably where there is as in this case an essentially

imaginary retroactivity issue.

that Elmore is simply the application of Sandstrom, and the
