ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL J. PEAR, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. PEAR:

9
10

11

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
This case is here on certiorari to the California

12

Court of Appeals, Fourth Appellate District.

13

the Laguna Beach Police Department received some tips over the

14

telephone that the occupants of a specific residence located in

15

the City of Laguna Beach were involved in drug trafficking.

16

Based on that information, on April 6, 1984 and again on May

17

4th, investigators of the Police Department contacted the

18

regular municipal trash collector when the morning trash was

19

collected at that residence.

20

In February 1984,

The investigators requested of the trash collector

21

that he go down the street, pick up the trashbags that were in

22

front of the residents' garage, were located in the public

23

street in front of the garage, that that trash collector on

24

each instance not mingle or mix the bags with other trash in

25

his truck and that he bring those bags down the block to the
investigator, which he did.

Heritage

The investigator in each of these two instances

1
2

returned to the Police Department with those trashbags and

3

examined the contents.

4

including drug residue and based on that, two separate search

5

warrants were issued for that residence in Laguna Beach.

6

California Court of Appeals affirmed the Trial Court's

7

dismissal of the drug possession for sale charges against the

8

respondents that were based on drugs found in the house during

9

the search warrants on the basis that the Fourth Amendment

10

On each occasion, items were found

The

prohibits warrantless trash searches.

11

The State respectfully asks this Court to reverse, in

12

accordance with an inconformity with the rulings of ten Federal

13

Circuit Courts of Appeals, the First, the Second, the Third,

14

the Fourth, the Fifth, the Sixth, the Seventh, the Eighth, the

15

Ninth on a case from California, and the Eleventh, all of which

16

have held that warrantless trash searches of discarded garbage

17

placed in an area accessible to the public for collection is

18

not protected by the Fourth Amendment.
Additionally, in the case before the Court, there is

19
20

a factor that it was not the police who on site examined the

21

trash but rather the trash collector at their request obtained

22

the trash.

23

that circumstances that the trash collector is an agent of the

24

police when he picks it up, but that the situation of trash

1

request of the police bestows no reasonable or legitimate

2

expectation of privacy on the homeowner, it is rather a case of

3

misplaced trust.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Pear, in response, your opponent

5

raises now a due process argument based on the California law

6

here and constitution giving the owner of the trash some

7

protected liberty interest in the trash, and certainly the law

8

in the State of California is different than that of a good

9

many States.

10

Now, do we need to address that due process question?

11

MR. PEAR:

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

First,

12

that issue has never been raised below, nor cast upon by the

13

California Court, either the trial court or the Court of

14

Appeals, nor was it raised in opposition to the Petition for

15

Hearing in the California Supreme Court, which was denied.

16

Additionally, California's exclusionary rule, which

17

was adopted in 1955, is a rule of judicial creation, it's a

18

judicial remedy rather than a constitutional right, and I would

19

suggest to the Court that California's decision by

20

Constitutional Amendment in 1982 to reduce what had become a

21

very large increased broader protection under search and

22

seizure to those confines of the Fourth- Amendment does not rise

23

to a Federal Constitutional issue.

24
25

Additionally, the respondent particularly Greenwood
argues that this Court in deciding what a legitimate
expectation of privacy is must look to the individual State

Reporting Corporation

1

law, and the State suggests that that argument should be

2

rejected.

3

broader standard of protection than the Federal Constitution

4

requires, the State in doing that would not be applying Fourth

5

Amendment law, and I would submit that this Court would not be

6

applying Fourth Amendment law if it took the State's

7

interpretation of the Fourth Amendment and found itself bound

8

by that in concluding what the Fourth Amendment is for the

9

entire nation.

«

While clearly the State may require a higher or

QUESTION:

10

But that isn't the argument as I

11

understood it.

12

I understood it was that a State may define the reasonable

13

expectations of privacy of its own citizens, and the California

14

legislature says nobody should search garbage, or something

15

like that.

16

that a California citizen, unlike the rest of the country, has

17

an expectation of privacy in his garbage?

18

It's not the entire nation, but the argument as

Would then could not one then make the argument

MR. PEAR:

No.

I would respond to that, Your Honor,

19

that the State would be free to do that but they would be

20

interpreting their constitution in imposing a broader

21

protection than the more —

22

QUESTION:

Say they didn't do it as a matter of

23

constitutional.

Let's say the legislature passed a statute

24

says as a declaration of California policy, we think people

25

ought to have a privacy interest in their garbage, and so we
instruct our police officers not to search garbage.

Could the

I would think that community standards

18

have been determined by this Court to be an appropriate method

19

of dealing with area obscenity, but counsel cites no cases, and

20

I think it would be inappropriate to say you would have a

21

community standard of Fourth Amendment rights, or a community

22

standard of Miranda rights, Fifth Amendment rights.

23

QUESTION:

Well, I agree, but the question here is

24

whether there's a reasonable expectation of privacy, and I'm

25

just wondering if every American citizen must have the same
expectation or is it possible that there could be different

2

say, it's a new question.
MR. PEAR:

3

That's, as you

I've never thought of it.

Well, taking this Court's analysis that a

4

reasonable expectation of privacy involves a two part analysis,

5

now the subjective expectation of citizens might vary from

6

community to community, it might vary among the members of a

7

single household.

9

either the concepts of property law or the general principles

But as to what constitutes what this Court

10

that society recognizes, I would submit that has to be a

11

national standard.

12

QUESTION:

Most property concepts we turn to State

13

law to define, and what could be more legitimate than a State

14

Statute in terms of objective reasonableness of the standard?

15

MR. PEAR:

I don't think the issue is objective

16

reasonableness in determining under Fourth Amendment what is a

17

legitimate expectation of privacy.

18

entertain that belief, but I don't believe under the Fourth

19

Amendment that belief is reasonable.

As the opinion by this Court in Rickus

indicated, you don't just look to Fourth Amendment cases to

9

decide what Fourth Amendment is.

But I would concede that it

10

would be suggested to the Court that society generally

11

recognizes this type of expectation if most States entertained

12

that view.

13

every Federal Circuit Court of Appeal that has considered the

14

issue have concluded quite the opposite, that there is no

15

reasonable expectation of privacy once you have relinquished

16

Conversely, in the case at bar, most states and

the analysis to apply.

And I think the State contends that the Federal cases that

we've cited to the Court, as well as the State cases, apply a

Katz analysis, but in looking at the legitimacy of an

QUESTION:

6

Do you think under the Fourth Amendment we

still look at abandonment as a separate sort of test or

approach?

MR. PEAR:

I think it is part of the test.

I don't

10

think abandonment in a property sense is the start and end of

the analysis under Katz.

concept is something you take into consideration.

13

when you do that, you come to the conclusion that the Courts

14

that have considered the issue have come to.

have abandoned a reasonable expectation of privacy in that

which you have abandoned.

There's also a suggestion in both respondent's briefs

18

that there is an element of harassment if the police are free

without a warrant or without probable cause to conduct

warrantless trash examinations.

21

the Court below does not sustain that claim.

22

those items of the transcript and record which I think negate

any type of harassment, it's the State's position that where

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

MR. PEAR:

Mr. Pear, you may proceed

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:

6

Furthermore, in answer to the fear that the

7

respondents express that trash searches without a warrant would

8

result or could result in harassment, I submit to the Court

9

that the nature of trash examination itself provides inherent

10

in it a limitation.

11

limits the number of times or circumstances under which police

12

will make such an examination.

it?

I'd assure you.
Also, with regard to the suggestion that the record

20

shows that there were months of monitoring of the trash, I

21

think that's based on a misreading of a portion of the Clerk's

22

transcript referred to by respondents at page 112 and page 113.

23

The question which confused the investigator was whether you

24

had occasion to do this over this period of time, and I submit

is clear that she understood the word, occasion, as could you

Strassner testified, it was only one or two weeks before April

at page 122 of the Clerk's transcript, she indicates the total

number of times of surveillance at the residence before the

it was one or 26 times?
MR. PEAR:

15

Would it have made any difference whether

I don't think so, Your Honor, as to the

issue of Fourth Amendment.
Finally, with regard to the questions that have been

16
17

asked this morning regarding looking at State law, I would

18

invite the Court's attention to Oregon v. Haas at page 720, the

19

material covered by footnote 4.

If there are no further questions, I've concluded.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY MICHAEL IAN GAREY, ESQ.

24

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

25

MR. GAREY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:

Heritage

13
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

Preceding somewhat backwards from how I'd intended to

2

proceed, I think I would like first if I may to answer Justice

3

O'Connor's question about the appropriateness of arguing the

4

due process claim in this Court.

5

aspects of this which I think dictate that the issue should be

6

addressed on its merits by this Court, not the least of which

7

are the circumstances that were existing at the time this

8

matter was argued in the Municipal Court, in the Superior Court

9

and in the Court of Appeals.

10

There are several different

In California for a period of over fifteen years,

11

stare decisis had dictated that searches essentially identical

12

to the one in this case were unlawful.

13

virtually all of our discussion revolved around concepts of

14

stare decisis and so there was no need at those Court levels,

- 15
16
17

Much of our discussion,

and I repeatedly stressed that at those Court levels, there is
no need to get into a detailed analysis of the State law issue.
However, that is not the same thing as to say that

18

the State law issue was waived.

19

was raised in the Municipal Court, although tersely.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

Indeed, the State law issue

What do you conceive to be the State law

issue, Mr. Garey?
MR. GAREY:

All right.

The State law issue, and I'll

23

perhaps get into this a little deeper on the merits in a

24

moment, but the State law issue itself is Article I, Section 13

25

of the California Constitution provides for protection against
unreasonable searches and seizures.

Heritage

Article I, Section 1

14
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

provides for a right of privacy which is described as

2

inalienable.
QUESTION:

3

And then the search and seizure provision

4

of the California Constitution was interpreted in the State

5

Supreme Court Krivda opinion, was it not?
MR. GAREY:

6
7

That is correct.

And

that's exactly what I mean by the State law issue.

8
9

That is correct.

QUESTION:

But we have determined, have we not, that

the decision rested at least partially on Federal grounds?
MR. GAREY:

10

Oh, yes.

Yes.

The argument centered,

11

and I think this is abundantly clear from the transcript, the

12

argument in the Municipal Court centered around the fact that

13

Krivda in its second opinion on remand had decided that the

14

original decision was based on both State and Federal grounds.

15

And I repeatedly emphasized that at the Municipal Court level.
QUESTION:

16
17

And therefore be reviewable here under

Michigan v. Long, would it not?
MR. GAREY:

18

It would be reviewable here under

19

Michigan v. Long to the extent that the Federal question is

20

posed.

21

That would be correct.
QUESTION:

Well, if it's been decided that both

22

Federal and State grounds support Krivda, certainly the Federal

23

question is posed, is it not?

24

MR. GAREY:

25

The Federal question is posed but it is

not posed entirely by itself.

And I think if I may go back

just a little bit and explain what I mean by that because we
15

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

get into a number of problems with that.

First of all, Krivda

2

originally was decided before Michigan v. Long.

3

that anybody has seriously contended it, and if they do, I'm

4

prepared to address it but I don't think anybody has seriously

5

contended that Krivda was not also decided upon independent

6

State grounds.

7

that fact, at least the dissent of this Court seems to have

8

recognized that fact in California v. Rooney quite recently.

9

I don't think that we need to get into an extended

I don't think

Indeed, this Court seems to have recognized

10

analysis of would the original Krivda opinion have survived a

11

Michigan v. Long analysis.

12

petitioner has sort of alluded to that problem, although not

13

really briefed it in any detail.

14

question I believe is as simple as, yes, there is a Federal

15

question posed in the sense that part of Krivda rested on

16

Federal grounds.

And I note that in a footnote,

So the answer to the Court's

17

There is an independent State ground clearly

18

presented because Krivda in addition relied on its own

19

independent State grounds.

MR. GAREY:

3

The State law issue and the due process argument

Thank you very much.

4

which I make in this Court was specifically, although again

5

very tersely raised at the Superior Court level in the argument

6

on the Section 995 Motion.

7

at page 16 where I pointed out that we are specifically not

8

waiving Article I, Section 13, and that we are relying in part

9

on the rationale that Article I, Section 28(d) which did away

10

11

principle in Mapp.

12

make at this point.

That is the germ of the argument that I

It was made tersely and I will concede that it was

13
14

made very tersely because the state of the law in California at

15

the time this matter was going through the municipal Court, the

16

Superior Court and the Court of Appeals, was stare decisis.

17

Either analysis you took, stare decisis came up at the same

18

point.

19

for certiorari, a Federal question at this point seems to me to

20

be raised on two different fronts.

21

As far as raising this in opposition to the petition

There is the Federal question that is posed to this

22

Court relating to whether or not the trashcan search as

23

indicated in this case or as based on the facts in this case

24

violates the Fourth Amendment in the straight Fourth Amendment

25

issue itself in the purest sense, and that is squarely
presented to this Court.

But there is another Federal question
V

Heritage

17
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

I think that is raised as well.
The problem in California is not that the search

2

3

under California law was lawful, because under California law

4

the search was unlawful.

5

adoption of Article I, Section 28(d), California Courts are

6

without power to cure or correct or remedy or deter, more

7

appropriately, even an intentional and a willful violation of

8

State Constitutional rights.

No, actually it would not.

And I would

1

that need be posed is that of whether or not California or any

2

State for that matter may define a right as fundamental or as

3

inalienable and refuse any effective remedy or any effective

4

enforcement for it.
To say that there are civil suits possible is the

5
6

same argument that was made in the interim period between Wolfe

7

v. Colorado and Mapp v. Ohio.

8

constitutionally compelled under the due process clause, the

9

same analogy applies here.

To the extent that Mapp is

And it is one thing to say that it

is a matter of California law, and indeed, it is a matter of

11

California law determining the scope of the right of privacy as

12

in California.

13

does not even address the question of can California define

14

that right as encompassing say a search like the one in the

15

present case and yet have no effective means, have the Court

completely stripped of its ability to use a deterrent effect,

17

provisions.

But the question that it does not answer and

And the answer is that if the State is in fact

legitimately even in view of the Federal due process clause

QUESTION:

This case

I'm not sure I follow this argument.

Mapp

involved the violation of a Federal Constitutional right.

15

MR. GAREY:

16

QUESTION:

Correct.
Correct.

And we said that the State

17

courts would have to enforce that violation of a Federal

18

Constitutional right by the exclusionary rule?

19

MR. GAREY:

20

QUESTION:

Absolutely.
Now, you're saying that it follows from

21

that that the State Courts also as a Federal Constitutional

22

matter, must enforce the violation of any State Constitutional

23

right by the exclusionary rule, and the Federal Courts have to

24

do the same.

25

MR. GAREY:
QUESTION:

Essentially, yes, but with one qualifier.
I don't see how the one follows from the

Heritage

21
Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

other.
MR. GAREY:

2

Well, if I may.

First, with one

3

qualifier, the qualifier would be limiting it to essentially

4

fundamental rights which the State has already or will find to

5

be fundamental substantial Constitutional rights bearing on the

6

right of privacy.

7

To the extent that Justice Scalia is questioning why

8

is it that this follows from Mapp, it is not that the holding

9

in Mapp which is indeed as the Justice just described it

10

directed towards violation of Fourth Amendment Federal law and

11

the Federal right of privacy, it is not that the holding

12

directly applies.

13

dynamics behind Mapp and why it applies through the due process

14

clause as opposed to through some non-existent supervisory

15

power that this Court would have over the States in general

16

applies to this situation equally.

17

that Mapp has to apply through the due process clause to

18

enforce Fourth Amendment rights because that's the only way

19

that you can insure that the State Police in essence will

20

respect the Fourth Amendment right, what I'm saying is that

21

that same due process command to use an exclusionary rule

22

applies to make the State enforce its own law.
QUESTION:

23
24
25

What I'm suggesting is the force, the

law.

Because if you're saying

It is our business to enforce the Federal

It's not our business to enforce the State law.
MR. GAREY:

In general, perhaps not.

However, as

recognized by this Court in Hewitt v. Helms and also Vitek v.
22

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1

Jones, there the due process clause recognizes rights that are

_2

created by Federal law and also those that are created under

_3

State law.

_4

the State Constitutional provisions create what is utilized and

5

And the question is whether or not the State law,

I'll use the phraseology that comes out of Vitek v. Jones,

_6

whether or not the State Constitutional provision has created a

_7

liberty interest in the citizen which the due process clause

_8

will prevent the State from arbitrarily taking away.
And that is why it applies through the due process

_9
10

clause in such a fashion very similarly to the way, not

11

identically to the way but very very similarly to the way that

12

Mapp v. Ohio compelled State obedience to the Fourth Amendment.

13

I think the way to underline why that is so necessary

14

is that historical context of this very case.

It has probably

15

never happened, or at least to my knowledge, it has never

16

happened in the history of this country since Mapp, that a

17

State has developed a body of law which we will put under the

18

general rubric of independent state grounds, that respects

19

certain rights of privacy in its citizens, and thereafter have

20

the State stripped of its ability to enforce that same right.,
If we need to see an example of why it is necessary

21
22

that the due process clause be so applied, this case is exactly

23

that case.

Because for 15 or 16 years in California, Krivda

24

held sway.

It was stare decisis.

25

that at the appellate court level, the State conceded that it

So much was it stare decisis

was stare decisis and that the Court of Appeals had no power to

Heritage

23
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

rule otherwise, at least on the Fourth Amendment aspect of the

2

stare decisis issue.
As soon as we have the advent of Article I, Section

3
4

28(d) there is what can only be described as a willful and

5

deliberate violation of State Constitutional privilege as

6

defined in the Krivda cases.

7

8

the due process clause will in fact protect the question of

9

whether or not for instance a mental health patient is going to

11

would be like Vitek v. Jones, for instance.
QUESTION:

12

Well, counsel, in open field searches, for

I think the answer to that really comes from turning

12

the question only slightly, and I mean very slightly.

13

question is should this Court allow any State to define a right

14

privacy as being inalienable or fundamental and be able to

15

effectively take it away by not enforcing it, and by allowing

16

its state officers to deliberately violate the State

Constitution.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

Why isn't that up to the State of

QUESTION:

You answer the question when you say, yes.

MR. GAREY:

Very well, then the answer is, yes, but

the question then still remains is can any State, whether
through its electorate, through its legislature or through its
executive branch take away a right that the State has granted.
QUESTION:
MR. GAREY:

And then take it away?
Exactly, exactly.

And I think I can

focus this point fairly simply by pointing out this:

had the

people of the State of California done away with completely as
in repealed Article I, Section 13 and Article I, Section 1,
that would probably take the argument that I am dealing with
now take it away completely and make it completely
inapplicable.

The problem is that they did not, and the

problem is that what they did is, they left the right intact,
the substantive right intact but took away any effective
remedy.

And that I think creates a due process issue where it

might not otherwise be.
And it is analogous to the situation where the State
has no obligation whatsoever to have say parole but it does
have an obligation to satisfy Federal due process in how it
deals with parole.

And so I think that the analogy is very

tight and it is very tight especially if one views the
rationale behind Mapp v. Ohio.

the concept of a reasonable expectation of privacy.

the question I think can be posed why, as in why should this

on the sidewalk not in an opaque bag so that anybody passing by

On the primary question of why, it is fairly clear,

If you lay it out

If it's put in an opaque container, especially under

18

the circumstances involved in this case where it is to be

19

picked up by the trash man, it is to be put in the trash truck

20

and within seconds, and the record here I think demonstrates

21

that, within seconds of it being picked up by the trashman,

ordinarily the mixing part of the garbage truck would mix it in

governmental search in relation to the private search if it

6

were not for the fact that the private search is not a Fourth
