ORAL ARGUMENT BY MICHAEL B. ROGER, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. ROGER:

8

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
The issue in this case is whether or not pension plan

11

fiduciaries are precluded from access to federal courts to

12

enforce continuing obligations to pay trust fund contributions

13

because such continuing obligations are required by the

14

National Labor Relations Act?

15

The court below ruled that the language of Section

16

515 of ERISA, which was amended in 1980 by the Multi-Employer

17

Pension Plan Amendment, which mandates the payment of

18

contributions under the terms of a collectively-bargained

19

agreement to the extent not inconsistent with law, did not

20

allow such access, ruling in effect that, due to the "pre­

21

emption" doctrine, the only recourse the trustees had was to

22

the National Labor Relations Board.

23

This Court has previously found that federal district

24

courts have jurisdiction to decide issues which normally arise

25

under the National Labor Relations Act, in order to effectuate

Heritage

3
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

other federal statutes, including ERISA.

2

of Fair Representation cases, such as Vaca v. Sipes.

3

in Kaiser Steel v. Mullins, where it said that defenses arising

4

under the National Labor Relations Act could be raised in

5

contractual enforcement claims.

6

It did so in the Duty
It did so

Likewise it did so in Connell Construction v.

7

Plumbers, where it allowed the litigants to an anti-trust claim

8

to look to the National Labor Relations Act for guidance.

9
10
11

It should do so in this particular case.
QUESTION:
practices claim?

12

MR. ROGER:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. ROGER:

15
16

Has it ever done so in an unfair labor

As such?
Yes.
As an unfair labor practice claim it has

not done so.
The court below failed to read Section 515 with the

17

same breadth we believe is required in order to give full

18

meaning to the congressional intent of a broad and

19

comprehensive legislative scheme embodied in ERISA and MPPAA,

20

the purpose of which was to protect the pension benefits of

21

many millions of workers in this country to ensure that when

22

they came time to retire, they would have their benefits

23

available to them.

24
25

When Congress passed ERISA in 1974, it in effect
codified fiduciary obligations which arose under common law,

Heritage

4
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

and it gave to fiduciaries of this plan the obligation to make

2

sure that the monies were available for participants to receive

3

their pensions and other benefits when it became due and owing.

4

Congress recognized in 1974 there were serious

5

problems in enforcing the obligations of employers to

6

contribute, and Congress learned unfortunately between 1974 and

7

1980, that what they thought they mandated in a very broad

8

statute in 1974 just was not enough.

9

passed the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980.

And so, in 1980, they

They did so for several reasons:

10

First of all, they

11

realized that because of the litigation arena out there,

12

employers were able to use the processes to avoid paying their

13

obligations, thus putting a great financial risk, the pension

14

plans and other plans, that were required to receive

15

contributions in order to pay out the benefits.
And secondly, they created a situation that would

16
17

force employers that withdrew from plans to pay their fair

18

share of withdrawal liability in circumstances where they chose

19

to withdraw or were forced to withdraw.
Thus, we had with the passage of the Multi-Employer

20
21

Pension Plan Amendments Act, the creation of two new statutory

22

schemes:

23

in the form,

24

of a collectively-bargained agreement, must to the extent not

25

inconsistent with law, meet and pay such obligations."

we had the creation of Section 515, which is worded
"every employer who is obligated under the terms

Heritage

5
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

It also created the "Unfunded Withdrawal Liabilities

1
2

Section," the obligation of employers to pay their fair share

3

where the circumstances were an employer permanently ceased to

4

have an obligation to make those contributions.

5

We are really dealing with here today, the situation

6

where in one case Congress used words under on form, and where

7

in another section, they used words under the other.

8

Section 515, the wording is,

9

collectively-bargained agreement."

In

"under the terms of a
In Section 4212, they talk

10

about the result of being "party to one or more agreements," or

11

as a result of a "duty arising under labor-management

12

relations."

13

We do not think the situation is inconsistent.

14

Withdrawal liability is a special circumstance, and it requires

15

a finding that there must be a permanent cessation of the

16

obligation to contribute.

17

relations context, the mere failure to pay one's bills, the

18

mere existence of a labor dispute, does not in itself create a

19

permanent obligation or cessation of obligation, to contribute.

20

The mere impasse in a labor-

In Section 515, however, because of what Congress

21

recognized was the increasing problems of employers failing to

22

pay their bills, as it were, they used different words:

23

used the words, "the terms of a collectively-bargained

24

agreement."

25

they

Now, the court below stated that those words were not

reading of Section 515.

4

agreement," does not mean "a collective bargaining agreement."

5

It means the "source from which the terms arose;" the

6

definition of the terms.

7

We suggest that that is too narrow a
The "terms of a collectively-bargained

Now, we have a situation in the labor-management

8

relations field — you must remember that the Act of 1980

9

really deals with collective bargaining and the collective

10

bargaining arena, not just some theoretical situation where

11

employers -QUESTION:

12

13

I think the obligation to pay in this case

arises from the labor law and not ERISA.

14

MR. ROGER:

The initial obligation arose from the

15

fact that Advanced Lightweight was party to a collective

16

bargaining agreement, which it chose to terminate by giving

17

notice to the Union, and which did not pay those contributions

18

after the termination date of the contract before anything else

19

happened.

20

expiration date of a contract and that period where either a

21

new contract was entered into, or impasse is reached.

22

We are dealing with a period of time between an

QUESTION:

And the obligation then, that the

23

employer's obligation, if there was bargaining impasse, his

24

obligation cease?

25

MR. ROGER:

Once impasse is reached --

Heritage

Reporting Corporation

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. ROGER:

3

Yes?
-- and the definition of "impasse" is up

in the air — and impasse is reached, the obligation —

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. ROGER:

Absolutely.

6

MR. ROGER:

Well, then it is an unfair labor practice

7

only, is it not?

9

After the contract has expired?

MR. ROGER:

8

But up until then, he owes the money?

It was clearly up until Section 515 of

ERISA, an unfair labor practice, enforceable before the

10

National Labor Relations Board.

11

Justice, that the interpretation given in Section 8(a)(5) and

12

8(d) is one this Court gave in NLRB v. Katz.

13

order to effectuate the purpose of the National Labor Relations

14

Act, we hold, "we must hold that employer whose contract

15

expired must continue in full force and effect the terms and

16

conditions of employment, including the payment of trust fund

17

contributions."
QUESTION:

18

But we must point out, Chief

It said that, in

So the obligation after he terminates is

19

an obligation pursuant to the terms of the contract?

contract, but it is not a contractual obligation — it is an

23

obligation under the labor laws?

24
25

The

That obligation is pursuant to the terms of the

MR. ROGER:

That is correct, Your Honor.

The

obligation does not necessarily require the existence of a

1

collective bargaining agreement to become extant.

2
3

QUESTION:

The agreement is done; it is gone — it is

terminated?
MR. ROGER:

4

The agreement is terminated, right.

5

the obligation continues.

6

are dealing -QUESTION:

7

But

And this is not a situation that we

Well, does not the obligation continue as

8

you described it, as a continuing obligation, or is it a new

9

obligation that arises?

10

MR. ROGER:

I believe that it is a continuing

11

obligation under the labor laws, Your Honor.

12

is a contractual —

13

QUESTION:

I believe that it

One is a contractual obligation; the other

14

is a labor law obligation, and you say that they are

15

continuing?
MR. ROGER:

16

When one negotiates a collective

17

bargaining agreement in today's economy, one does so in the

18

context of the laws which we know exist, and I must point out

19

that the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act

20

specifically deals with obligations which initially rise

21

pursuant to collective bargaining and the collective bargaining

22

process.

23

were, parties to collective bargaining know that the mere

24

expiration date of their contract does not end their

25

obligations.

Knowing that that is the arena of this "war" as it

Those obligations continue under law.

9

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

Now that

1

law happens to be interpretations of the National Labor —
QUESTION:

2

Would it not at least be theoretically

3

possible that during the period between the giving of the

4

notice saying, "I intend to terminate my relations with the

5

Union at the end of the contract period," that some bargaining

6

went on as to the possibility of renewal, and before the date

7

arises, they reach an impasse and find out they will not be

8

able to continue.

That could happen.

MR. ROGER:

9

Well, that not only could happen, Your

10

Honor, it is a situation which exactly does happen, and

11

actually, under Section 8(d) of the Act, Congress by statute,

12

said that, "when you give your notice 60 days prior to the

13

expiration date of the contract, you must statutorily maintain

14

all terms and conditions in effect for at least a 60-day term,

15

or the expiration date of the contract, whichever occurs

16

later. "

17

Now, the situation that we have before us may include

18

that. But it does not necessarily preclude the other situation

19

where employers and unions representing employees have

20

contracts expire by virtue of their dates, have given notice

21

that they intend to have a new contract negotiated, go through

22

the process of negotiating contracts, sometimes for many, many

23

months, and then negotiate a new contract, all the time the

24

employers are continuing to contribute into the trust funds

25

because the obligation has continued; the participants and the

10

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

workers and beneficiaries are entitled to their benefits; and

2

then when the impasse is reached where a new contract is then

3

arrived at, the definition of what the term "collectively

4

bargained agreement" under Section 515 becomes applicable.

5

Conceivably, the impasse will say, "there will be no

6

further trust fund contributions."

7

there will be a different form of trust fund contributions, or

8

a different date upon which they may be due.

9

Another alternative may be

But until that point in time arises, trustees, the

10

fiduciaries, who are not in any position to know, because they

11

are not direct participants in the collective bargaining

12

process — indeed, in the plans that are before the Court

13

today, you are dealing with many thousands of employers over a

14

very large geographic area, and there is no reason to assume

15

ore even to hope to assume, that the trustees will have any

16

idea that the parties to the contract have either given notice

17

of a desire to terminate or have the contract expire, or have

18

engaged in collective bargaining --

19

QUESTION:

Well, are you not suggesting, then, that

20

the Plaintiffs in this litigation are probably the worst people

21

in the world to litigate the issue of whether collective

22

bargaining has reached an impasse?

23

MR. ROGER:

They may be in the position, as you

24

suggest, of not being able to determine an impasse, but we

25

suggest a district court has the full power to determine an

11

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

impasse, that in fact, under the Multi-Employer Pension Plan

2

Amendments Act, Congress said that it is up to the federal

3

district court to determine that in those circumstances where

4

they must assess withdrawal liabilities.

5

QUESTION:

Yes, but they do it in an adversary

6

proceeding, in which the complaining party does not know much

7

about the issue, according to your description.

8
9

MR. ROGER:

Well, in the withdrawal liability

situation in fact, Justice, they must attempt to arbitrate that

10

issue before it ever gets before a district court.

11

when one of the parties, specifically the withdrawing employer,

12

refuses to participate in the arbitration process, that the

13

trustees are then forced to go into district court to enforce

14

that obligation.

15

QUESTION:

It is only

That may be true. The withdrawal liability

16

situation is a little different, because it is not an unfair

17

labor practices situation.

18

But in the cases we are dealing with, you are

19

suggesting that the trustees have to initiate this litigation

20

even though they really do not know the facts or much about the

21

legal issues that may be dispositive.

22

MR. ROGER:

It is entirely possible and in many cases

23

probable the trustees must institute litigation to collect on

24

contributions they believe to be due and owing because of the

25

passage of time.

Trustees in a situation such as the facts

12

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

before this case, and admittedly we are on a very minimal

2

record in this case because it went up on Summary Judgment —

3

the contract expired on June 16, 1983.

4

even be in a position to know until approximately a month later

5

whether or not that employer has allowed the contract to

6

expire; has simply decided to pay his bill that month; or

7

whether or not that employer in fact paid through the balance

8

of the month of June, because the bills are paid monthly —

9

trustees do not know until that bill is not paid or a report is

10

11

The trustees would not

not made.
Now, the trustees are not in a position to act as a

12

collective party.

13

trustees of multi-employer plans are not the parties to the

14

contract; are not responsible, and should not allow parties to

15

the contract to determine their responsibilities.

16

This Court has said on many occasions,

Rather, Congress has mandated under Section 404(a)

17

that the trustees have the responsibilities to ensure that

18

these funds flow in in order to ensure that the benefits will

19

be available when these persons have to have them.

20

QUESTION:

So they have to assume all the time, you

21

are saying, that there has not been bargaining to an impasse

22

and bring suit, is that it?

23

MR. ROGER:

They must assume until somebody tells

24

them specifically that the parties to the contract that,

25

there is an impasse, and (b) that -- a new contract has been

Heritage

13
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

(a)

1
2

arrived at.
Unfortunately, however, we have a very broad spectrum

3

between that phrase,

"new contract" and "impasse."

Ironically,

4

in the time cases which are cited in the Respondent's brief, we

5

have -- are almost two, two-and-a-half year periods between the

6

cessation of the obligation of the contributions to termination

7

of the expiration date of the contract, coupled with the

8

question whether or not there had been a withdrawal for

9

purposes of assessment of withdrawal capability, and we had the

10

courts saying to us,

11

almost two and a half years, no contributions coming in for

12

almost two and a half years, and no abandonment of the strike,

13

does not mean that there has been a permanent withdrawal or

14

cessation of the obligation to contribute — indeed, an impasse

15

in itself is not a permanent cessation of the obligation.

16

QUESTION:

"the mere fact that there was a strike for

Mr. Roger, what would be your position if

17

a charge had been filed, if the general counsel — did not the

18

general counsel turn down --

19

MR. ROGER:

In one of these particular cases, Your

20

Honor, the general counsel turned down a charge filed by one of

21

the unions over a failure to give information.

22

QUESTION:

Suppose that the only charge that was

23

involved here was not turned down by the general counsel, but

24

it was filed, and there was a proceeding that was underway --

25

do you think that the federal court at your behest should

14
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

undertake to
QUESTION:

2

In that circumstance, Justice, we know

3

that the National Labor Relations Board by its own rules and

4

by-laws is limited in the kinds of remedies that it can give.

5

Whether or not a federal district court under those

6

circumstances --

7

QUESTION:

I know, but there is —

MR. ROGER:

— should postpone —

9

QUESTION:

10

to decide whether there has been bargaining in the impasse.
MR. ROGER:

11
12

But it is the business of the Labor Board

it is the decision of the Labor Board to

make a determination as to whether an impasse has been reached.
QUESTION:

13

Exactly — exactly.

And suppose that

Labor Board had decided that there had been a bargaining

15

impasse?

MR. ROGER:

If the Board had made a finding of fact

Would that bind the federal court?
The federal court generally will defer to

the board.
QUESTION:

I did not ask you that.

Do you think

legally it would be bound -- legally?
MR. ROGER:

If we are dealing with a contribution

24

obligation, as opposed to a withdrawal liability, I think the

25

federal court would have to defer to a finding -- a finding by

the National Labor Relations Board.

2

counsel determination that there is no -- case.
QUESTION:

3

As opposed to a general

I take it that the so-called "pre-emption"

4

doctrine in here is just -- the business of interfering with

5

the Labor Board's exclusive jurisdiction to decide unfair labor

6

practices?

7

MR. ROGER:

8

QUESTION:

9

That is it exactly, Mr. Justice.
And the general counsel in one of these

cases turned down a charge?
MR. ROGER:

10

Over the -- not over the failure to make

11

contributions — they turned down a charge over a different

12

issue:

13

information that the Union had requested in order to

14

collectively bargain.
QUESTION:

15
16

The Union has never asked -- never

complained to the Board about these contributions?

17
18

they turned down a charge over a failure to give

MR. ROGER:

This has not been filed by the Union, nor

had the trustees filed the charge, Your Honor.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. ROGER:

What if they had?

Could you?

Could I as a human individual?

21

Could the trustees have done so?

22

should be required to do so is really the issue, because the

23

remedies the Board allows are not the same remedies that ERISA

24

allows.

25

yes.

Yes.

Whether the trustees

We do not get the mandatory
QUESTION:

That may be so, but the -- what you have

16

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

2

to find out is whether there has been a bargaining impasse.
MR. ROGER:

Not necessarily.

We have to find out

3

whether a contract is expired, or are we in that position

4

during which the bargaining process may have to continue, and

5

as I suggest to the Justice, that process may go on for many,

6

many, many months or years.

7

QUESTION:

I know, but the Board may say that if

8

there is an impasse.

9

MR. ROGER:

They may ultimately decide there is an

10

impasse somewhere down the road.

11

however, is what do we do in the mean time?

QUESTION:

What we are concerned about,
In every other

What can the Board do for — suppose there

14

has been a charge filed that you have not maintained the terms

15

of the contract and you have not bargained at impasse?

16

suppose the Board agrees that there has been no impasse, and

17

now we have to remedy your failure to live up to the same

18

wages, or pay the same wages or pay the same contributions?

19

What can they do?

20
21
22

But

Can they not order the —

MR. ROGER:

The Board clearly has a restriction, and

has in fact ordered employers to pay trust fund contributions.
However, the Board does not have the power within it,

23

at least as it determines, nor does it have the requirement

24

that they must assume, or assert, that obligation.

25

counsel has that authority not to proceed; the general counsel

17

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

The general

1

has the authority to proceed in part; the general counsel has

2

the authority to settle the case for less than the full amount

3

of the obligation.

4

QUESTION:

I would think that the trustees would be

5

in much better shape, it seems to me, if they actually asked

6

the general counsel to file a charge and he said,

7

you can conclude from that that the Board just is not worried

8

about its jurisdiction in this case.

9
10

MR. ROGER:

And

And highly likely, the Board may choose

not to assert its jurisdiction in this case.

11

QUESTION:

12

And the situation we are then confronted

14

with, Your Honor, is the fact that in all circumstances where

an employer has an obligation under whatever source to make

jurisdiction for a claim made by the trustees to get the

18

payment of those contributions -- save an except that on

and prior to an impasse or a new contract being reached.

AS AMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS

MR WALLACE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I would like first, if I may, to differ with an
answer that was given to the Chief Justice of the first case

10

that we cite on page 11 of our brief.

IBT Local # 20 v. Morton

11

is a case in which this Court upheld federal court jurisdiction

12

when authorized by Congress in another statute to determine an

13

unfair labor practice question, and the same determination was

14

later upheld in a case not cited in any of the briefs, of five

15

or six years ago, called Allied Lines v. Longshoremens Union,

16

which was also a question of a violation of 8(b)(4) of the

17

National Labor Relations Act, a damages suit for secondary

18

activity in violation of the National Labor Relations Act.

19

was when the Longshoremen were refusing to unload cargo from

20

Russia as a protest against what was going on in Afghanistan.

21

The second point I would like to make in supporting

It

22

the position we have taken in a brief signed by general counsel

23

of the Labor Board, as well as the Solicitor General, and the

24

Department of Labor, is that it is quite clear on the face of

25

the very provision at issue that -- and it is set forth toward

Heritage

19
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

the end of the appendices to the Petition for Certiorari, page

2

D-18, the provision at issue is toward the top of page D-18, in

3

the Appendix, that Congress did not on the face of this

4

provision reserve to the National Labor Relations Board

5

exclusive authority to determine whether a violation of the

6

National Labor Relations Act has given rise to continuing

7

viability to make contributions, because if the terms of the

8

contribution plan were to specify that the employer is

9

obligated to continue making his contributions as long as he

10

has a duty under the contract itself, or under any law

11

referring to the contract, to make those payments, then there

12

could be no doubt on the face of the statute that there would

13

be authority to sue.

14

QUESTION:

But that is just rewriting the contract.

15

It would also be clear if they said, "you have to keep going

16

until 1999."

17

It would be a different contract.

MR WALLACE:

This would not rewrite the collective

18

bargaining agreement; it would be that the plan itself -- and

19

the plan could be drafted or meant to be drafted —

20

QUESTION:

Well, either by the agreement of the plan.

It could, but the law would have to —
So the arguments that are made in Mr.

12

Roger's brief, particularly about how important it was to the

13

Congress that these funds get this money and what-not, you are

14

really asserting that, though it was so important, Congress

15

left it to NLRB regulations?

16

MR WALLACE:

Well, it has -- had been established at

14

MR. WALLACE:

It is purely,

But what was of great importance to the

15

Congress is that the trustees have a discrete, effective,

16

unambiguous, efficacious remedy, as they said, that would not

17

be cluttered up with other issues, and the defenses that were

18

pointed to as ones that had undesirably burdened the pre­

19

existing remedy were defenses raising other issues under the

20

collective bargaining agreement, raising other questions of

21

unfair labor practices, which would be very apt to be lumped

22

into any unfair labor practice complaint the trustees would

23

have to take to the Board, and the general counsel would have

24

unreviewable discretion whether to press the claim and how to

25

settle the claim, and other issues might get much higher

22

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

priority in a settlement than the trustees' desire to collect

2

arrearages and back payments, which may seem more remote from

3

the immediate interests of the parties to a labor dispute, and

4

the settlement might look toward preserving labor peace and

5

keeping people employed at the moment, which is a high priority

6

of the National Labor Relations Act.

7

You would wind up with a species of the very evil

8

that Congress had focused on in adopting the 1980 Amendments,

9

even though they did not specifically focus on the obligation

10

that applies under the National Labor Relations Act after the

11

expiration date of the contract.

12

But this is something very familiar in the law --

13

there are obligations under leases after the expiration date.

14

They still flow from the terms of the lease.

15

commonplace thing for people to go on working and businesses to

16

go on in business after the expiration date of a collective

17

bargaining agreement — while bargaining goes on, sometimes

18

rather sporadically.

And it is a

What Congress was particularly concerned about was to

separate out the ability of the trustees to have an efficient

ORAL ARGUMENT BY MARK S. ROSS, ESQ.

2

ON BEHALF OF

3
MR. ROSS:

4

6

RESPONDENTS

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
The issue presented here is whether an employer's

7

failure to contribute to a trust fund after the expiration of a

8

collective bargaining agreement, an alleged violation of

9

Section 8(a)(5), is actionable under ERISA 515, or whether such

10

alleged violations fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of

11

the National Labor Relations Act?

12

Violation of Section 8(a)(5) is an unfair labor

13

practice falling within the primary jurisdiction of the NLRB.

14

And it is axiomatic that courts are without jurisdiction over

15

such violations.

16

a few rare exceptions in which this Court has permitted courts

17

to deal with labor law issues, but generally speaking, those

18

have been in two very discrete situations — one in which there

19

was express statutory authority for the federal court to do so,

20

such as Section 303 of the Labor Management Relations Act,

21

which was an issue in the Mortons case, or where it was a

22

collateral issue and was necessary to do so in order to decide

23

issues arising under other federal statutes.

24
25

I say it is axiomatic because there have been

MR. ROSS:

I am sorry, Your Honor?

2

QUESTION:

What about a case like this one, if the

3

general counsel declines to pursue the matter for the NLRB?

Should there be no federal cause of action, then, by the

5

MR. ROSS:

I do not believe that 515 creates such a prospect.
QUESTION:

8

9

I cannot speak to whether there should be.

You do not think even under the

circumstances that a suit could be filed in federal court?
MR. ROSS:

10

I do not believe so, Your Honor, and the

11

reason for that is, that the general counsel presumably would

12

want to dismiss the charge or refuse to issue a complaint on

13

that charge because the general counsel found that the charge

14

was without any basis in fact or there was insufficient

15

evidence to support the charge, would be an administrative

16

determination that the prosecutorial body charged with

17

enforcing the National Labor Relations Act found that there was

18

no violation of the Act.

20

contributions within the meaning of Section 8(a)(5).

And if there is no violation of the

of prosecutorial discretion there, but it does not go to the

merits.

MR. ROSS:

There may be some element

Well, Your Honor, I would grant you that

Heritage

27

there are some rare occasions where that prosecutorial

discretion does exist, but they are highly -- they are rare.

3

And highly infrequent —

4
5
6

QUESTION:

And if you are right, then the employer

would just get a complete windfall?
MR. ROSS:

Well, I cannot actually think of an

7

instance in which that prosecutorial discretion would exist

8

except in that limited instance where the employer was not so

9

large or substantial as to satisfy the administrative

10

requirements for exercise of the Board's jurisdiction.

11

than that, the only thing that I can think of that would prompt

12

the general counsel to refuse to issue a complaint would be a

13

decision by the investigative branch of the general counsel

14

that there was not sufficient evidence to support the charge,

15

and that would be the administrative determination that the

16

employer did not violate Section 8(a)(5), and that there was no

17

violation of the Act, and therefore there would be no

18

obligation to continue the contributions to the trust fund.

Therefore, what we are dealing with

Now, of course,that analysis changes if Section 515

was intended to weed Section 8(a)(5) type claims or if Congress

12

intended Section 515 to give trust funds license to go into

13

14

believe that Congress intended 515 to reach that result, and we

15

say that because contrary to the trust funds, nothing in the

16

plain wording of Section 515 even remotely suggests that 515

17

was intended 8(a)(5) or to invade the NLRB's jurisdiction.

is, whether an employer can write himself out of this problem

14

I believe, Your Honor, that the collective

That is inconsistent with what you have

just said, that the measure is the status quo.

Instead it speaks to the terms and conditions of

Justice Scalia, if the contract specifically authorizes the

The amount and measure of the employer's

terms of the collective bargaining agreement that has expired.

instance is that the NLRB and its enforcement of the National

Labor Relations Act has concluded that employers must maintain

4

the status quo while the bargaining obligation is being

satisfied.

6

unilateral changes while that process is in progress, he or she

emasculates the collective bargaining process, and certainly

the NLRB v. Katz case.

The theory being that the employer is free to make

QUESTION:

10

That ought to be enforceable somewhere,

11

that obligation.

And it is discretionary whether it will be

12

enforced by the NLRB, the general counsel has some discretion,

13

and so that is the difficulty.

14

MR. ROSS:

I can understand your concern with that,

15

although I think you have to look at the exercise of that

16

discretion within the context of the National Labor Relations

17

Act in the scheme created by Congress when it passed that law.

18

It recognized that the general counsel is going to exercise

19

discretion in reviewing unfair labor practice charges in

20

deciding which should and which should not be taken into

21

complaint.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

I do not know why the Court should worry

about the Labor Board?
MR. ROSS:

I think the Court should worry about it in

that instance because the prosecutorial officer of the NLRB has

Heritage

36
Reporting Corporation

1

j

concluded that it will not effectuate the policies of the
National Labor Relations Act to prosecute.

And the obligation

2

3

under 8(a)(5) is an obligation which exists for the purpose of

4

fostering collective bargaining and for the purpose of

5

effectuating the policy of that law.

6

QUESTION:

In any event here I take it that the

7

general counsel did not turn down a complaint based on the

8

failure to pay these contributions.

9

MR. ROSS:

That is correct, Your Honor.

Neither the

10

labor unions involved nor the trust funds filed unfair labor

11

practice charges in this case, and indeed I do not think it

1.2

comes as any small coincidence that the trust fund suits filed

13

in this case were filed exactly one day after the NLRB's

14

statute of limitations expired, such that I am sure that it

15

would be argument later that it would be impossible to invoke

16

the jurisdiction of the NLRB because the statute had run.

17

QUESTION:

If the Court goes ahead, can that same

18

issue of — well, what I am — is there a situation in which a

19

court can decide the unfair labor practice matter and then the

20

same issue come before the Board?

25

MR. ROSS:

Can that ever happen?

It has happened, Your Honor.

In that

decision, I presume?

some caselaw that says that the NLRB's determination would
ultimately be determinative of the labor law issue.

2

I

3

apologize because the name of the case escapes me, but I know

4

that there is a Supreme Court decision dealing with this, where

5

you had a companion federal court case and an NLRB case

6

progressing concurrently.

7

Court and the Court said that the NLRB's determination would be

8

determinative of the issue.

Both of them ended up before the

I believe that the NLRB's findings were to issue a

9
10

complaint in this case would be collateral estoppel, and that

11

collateral estoppel would attach to findings made by the NLRB

12

were it to have gone on this matter; I do not believe that

13

there would be a similar result were the court to hear this,

14

because I believe the NLRB would have exclusive jurisdiction

15

over it and the court's findings would be in excess of its

16

authority.
QUESTION:

17

Mr. Ross, will you state for me, because I

18

am a little fuzzy on it, what is your legal defense to paying

these contributions?

24

MR. ROSS:

Well, there are

25

a number of reasons, Your

First of all, we believe that, based on the peculiar

1

facts in this case, there may not be a necessity for an

2

impasse, and that indeed, the unions waive whatever right they

3

had to bargain with us, and we are therefore free to implement

4

changes, in addition to which, assuming that the unions can be

5

found ever to have done anything in furtherance of their

6

bargaining interest, we believe that we would be able to

7

establish the existence of an impasse.

8

Lastly, and I think that this is an important point,

9

and that is, we believe that the duty to bargain under Section

10

8(d) is a mutual obligation.

And that is an obligation that

11

attaches not only to the employer but it is a duty that

12

attached to the labor organization.
Now, in this instance, we clearly sent a letter to

And we feel

that constitutes a breach of their duty to bargain, and I think

that it speaks -- that it is just the kind of thing that this

Court recoqnized in the Katz case, where it said that there may

23

QUESTION:

The bottom line is, you contend that it is

not really before — it is really a matter of National Labor

25

Relations law -- there is no duty to make contributions.

Are you continuing to work in a way that will make them
eligible for larger benefits than they — they were not?

4

MR. ROSS:

I cannot

5

answer the question — I do not think the case has been fully

6

developed enough to really deal with that issue; I do not know

7

of any instance in which the employees have asserted that they

8

are; I just do not know the answer to that.
But I might add that, if it turns out that the

9

.

I do not know, Your Honor.

10

employers were free, or permitted under the facts of this case,

11

to cease making these contributions, certainly the employees

12

could not claim any increased rights or benefits by virtue of

13

the fact that the employer exercised its legitimate rights

14

under the National Labor Relations Act and ceased making

15

payments.

16

of some concern to the Court, I am not sure that it is a

17

question that should really affect the Court's consideration.

18

So, while I understand that it is a question that is

I was commenting before on the unions' — what we

19

consider to be the unions' failure to bargain in this case, and

20

I would like to refer the Court to the Katz decision, and most

21

specifically to page 748 of that case, where Justice Brennan

22

recognized that there may be circumstances in which the Board

could or should accept its excusing or justifying an employer's

m/

particular case, the fact that the Union basically sat on its
rights and did nothing to come to the bargaining table, was a

3

breach of its duty to bargain, and when you think about it, it

4

makes perfectly good sense from a labor policy standpoint

5

because an employer's ability to make unilateral changes in

6

that instance actually furthers the collective bargaining

7

process.
If an employer is locked in perpetuity, into

8
9

maintaining the status quo because its bargaining partner will

10

not come to the bargaining table, what better force to get that

11

Union's attention than to be able to make these unilateral

12

changes, such that the Union has something to lose?
And in this recessionary economy, or the economy

where you find employers are negotiating.

I do not quite know whether there is an

MR. ROSS:

Presumably they will know when they do

that, but I believe that there are a variety of issues here

22

that are labor law issues that really belong with the Board,

23

and not with the district court, and that these issues should

24

be decided by the Board.

25

There are a couple of other points I would like to

touch upon:

23

to go to the NLRB they will not receive the statutory relief
provided to them under Section 502(g)(2), because the Board,

4

they say,

5

remedial powers, and does not have the authority to grant 502-

6

like relief.

7

"does not have the remedial power."

Or has only

Now, in our brief, we show the Court that there are a

8

number of NLRB decisions in which, if not 502 relief, at least

9

the functional equivalent, or at least something very similar

10
11

,

the trust funds' complaint that if they are forced

to 502 relief, have been granted.
Besides the remedies appropriate to Section 515 and

12

502 collection actions -- and that is what they are:

13

collection actions -- may not be appropriate for matters of

14

federal labor law and policy.

15

to enforce contractual promises to pay, and it is appropriate

16

that Congress provided for stiff penalties against employers

17

who breach their promises to pay. These are penalties which

18

discourage contests over what are clear-cut contractual

19

obligations.

20

The ERISA actions are intended

On the other hand, federal labor policy and issues

21

arising under the National Labor Relations Act are not nearly

22

so clear-cut or simple as mere contractual promises and the

23

breaches of those promises.

typically involve a struggle between labor and management and a

That is what the

Mandatory punitive remedies in ERISA will chill the

rights of employers to assert these legitimate interests under

the National Labor Relations Act, and upset the delicate

balance of power struck by Congress and the NLRB through its

interpretation of the National Labor Relations Act.
Under these circumstances we believe that it is

labor policy.

11

understandable why Congress limited Section 515 to contractual

12

claims and left Section 8(a)(5), including asserted

13

continuations of trust funds, to the NLRB.

14

We also want to point out that, contrary to the trust

passing the National Labor Relations Act.
QUESTION:

4
5

that the Board is not the least bit worried bout interference

6

with its jurisdiction?
MR. ROSS:

7

,

You have not mentioned all of the fact

Well, Your Honor, I believe, based on some

8

Dissents that I have read recently issued by the Board by

9

certain members of the Board, that certain members of the Board

10

would like not to deal with these problems, but I believe that

11

the statute mandates that they do so, and that they are obliged

12

to fulfill their statutory obligations.

13

so, and 515 does not alter that result.

And so they must do

The trust funds' complaints about the funding in an

14
15

8(a)(5) complaint are also speculative and premature because

16

funds must be entitled to monies before they can claim that

17

they are going to be underfunded.

18

entitlement to these funds is predicated upon a finding that

19

the employers' actions violate section 8(a)(5).

20

8(a)(5) violation, then the employer is under no obligation to

21

pay under the National Labor Relations Act, and the plans lose

22

nothing.

Now by that, I mean that the

Further, an adverse decision here will not mean that the trust

Has the Board taken the position, or the

No, Your Honor, they have not.

have to deal with these cases.
