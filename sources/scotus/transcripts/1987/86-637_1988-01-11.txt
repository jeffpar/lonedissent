ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE GOLD, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. GOLD:

9
10
11

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
The Communication Workers of America, the petitioners

12

in this case, are the exclusive bargaining representative of a

13

group of employees who work for the American Telephone and

14

Telegraph Company as it then was when this case began, and

15

various of its subsidiaries.

16

respondents here, are a group of individuals who work for a

17

Bell Telephone Company in an organized bargaining unit which is

18

covered by a Union Security provision, namely a provision

19

requiring that an amount equal to the dues charged by the Union

20

to its members are paid by all employees in the bargaining unit

21

thirty days after they become employed, as a condition of

22

continued employment.

23

The plaintiffs in this case, the

This case began when a group of twenty employees sued

24

to invalidate that requirement and to limit the requirement to

25

an amount equal to what the Union pays for what can be defined
in various ways but can be said to be for activities germane to

1

collective bargaining.
The District Court on constitutional grounds and

2

3

eventually an en banc Court of Appeals by a vote of six of the

4

Judges on different grounds held that the plaintiffs had stated

5

a valid Federal cause of action, and that the relief prayed for

6

should be granted.

7

The Second Circuit concluded to the opposite effect,

8

holding that all of the Federal claims made by the plaintiffs,

9

one of which is based on Section 8(a)(3) of the National Labor

10

Relations Act, another which is based on the duty of fair

11

representation, and the final one of which is based on the

12

First Amendment to the Constitution, are without merit.

13

case is here on our petition.

The

14

The National Labor Relations Act treats with the

15

question presented here in terms, and I'd like to begin by

16

directing the Court to the language of Section 8(a)(3) which is

discrimination on the basis of union membership and union

20

activity.

21

which in essence was in the law in 1935, and the second of

22

which was added in 1947.

23

Section 8(a)(3) of the NLRA prohibits in general terms

Section 8(a)(3) then has two provisos, the first of

The first proviso says in effect that nothing in this

24

subchapter or in any other statute of the United States shall

25

preclude the type of union security agreement at issue here.
And the second proviso in its second clause, the one labeled

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

(b), which is on page 2-a of the Appendix, says that no

2

employer may under these provisos discharge any individual if

3

he has reasonable grounds for believing that membership in the

4

union was denied or terminated for reasons other than the

5

failure of the employee to tender the periodic dues and the

6

initiation fees uniformly required as a condition of acquiring

7

or retaining membership.

8

9
10

QUESTION:

The second proviso is then a proviso to

the first proviso, so to speak?
MR. GOLD:

I think both provisos are provisos to the

11

basic prohibition.

12

read and have been read together, each one of the conditions

13

stated in the two provisos have to be satisfied for the clause

14

to be lawful and to impose the requirement.

15

has concluded in both the Schermerhorn and the General Motors

16

cases, what the provisos under the NLRA taken together mean, at

17

the very least — and we're going to find out in this case

18

whether they mean more — but what they mean at the very least

19

is that an individual who says I am willing to pay the

20

initiation fee charged by the Union which is the exclusive

21

representative, and I am willing to pay the periodic dues

22

uniformly charged to members, cannot be dismissed from

23

employment by the employer without violating Section 8(a)(3).

24
25

I think the two provisos are intended to be

And as this Court

So in terms of the plain language of Section 8(a)(3),
it seems to us as we have argued throughout and as the Second
Circuit held, that this case is an open and shut case.

1

Congress did not say simply that individuals covered by a

2

collective bargaining agreement of this kind would be required

3

to pay undefined dues leaving an ambiguity as the respondents

4

claim.

5

that to be lawful, these agreements can go no further than the

6

dues and initiation fees uniformly required as a condition of

7

acquiring or retaining membership.
QUESTION:

8
9

Rather the statute imposes a clear requirement, namely,

Mr. Gold, is there no ambiguity there?

Would you say that any charge is made for initiation is an

10

initiation fee and any amount required as dues, no matter what

11

it is devoted to, would come within this provision?

12

suppose a union decides that it's going to provide retirement

13

benefits for its membership, and it's going to fund these not

14

out of payments from their paychecks, but it's going to fund it

15

out of union dues, and this retirement is only given to union

16

members.

17

dues but the union members are willing to pay it because they

18

can get retirement?

19

MR. GOLD:

I mean,

Now, can the union do that and charge very very high

First of all on initiation fees, Congress

20

did decide to regulate the amounts in part for the type of

21

concern that you've stated.

22

1947, the House proposed to regulate dues to assure that they

23

were reasonable, they weren't too high, they were used for

24

purposes that are called proper under the circumstances, and

25

the Senate refused, saying there should not be such regulation.

Secondly, with regard to dues, in

It seems to us that putting aside the illumination

Heritage

6
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

one gets from the evolution, that when you talk about the

2

amount uniformly required to maintain your good standing

3

membership in the organization, it's the amount uniformly

4

required without regard to how it is thereafter used.

5

the amount that each person who is a member and chooses to

6

continue to be a member is charged.

7

QUESTION:

That is

But if that's what Congress intended, it

8

could simply have said, instead of the failure of the employee

9

to tender the periodic dues and the initiation fees uniformly

10

required, it could have simply said the failure of the employee

11

to tender any amount of money uniformly required as a condition

12

of acquiring or retaining membership.

13

words, dues and fees.

14

MR. GOLD:

Congress had to use the

For a good reason, and certainly would

15

have preferred the language you just articulated.

16

took away from unions, not only the closed shop, but also took

17

away from unions the ability to charge as a condition of

18

continued employment those who didn't want to be voluntary

19

members assessments and fines and non-periodic payments of

20

those kind.

QUESTION:

acquiring?
7

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

MR. GOLD:

1

Yes.

If everybody, in other words, it is

2

normal and the language of the Railway Labor Act to which we

3

will get in a minute is different in this regard.

4

for unions to charge assessments in addition to dues.

5

example, some unions have a practice of charging each member

6

two dollars a month to be a member.

7

once yearly charge of three dollars which is payable only once

8

a year to fund a convention.

9

that's an assessment, and assessments are uniform, but they are

10

not periodic in the sense that the Statute has been understood.

11

And therefore, an individual in a position of the objecting

12

payors in this case cannot under the NLRA be required to pay

13

the assessment.

14

QUESTION:

It is normal
For

In addition, there is a

In the language of the trade,

But if you eliminated that and put it in

15

the dues, it would be okay, which the union could do, I

16

presume?

17

MR. GOLD:

That's right.

18

QUESTION:

We're not going to have any more

19

assessments, we're just going to raise the dues three dollars a

20

year.

21

MR. GOLD:

If the union can, and the Landrom-Griffin

22

Act provides that you have to get membership approval, as

23

opposed to the situation of public bodies where the

24

representative can act, provide that where the union goes to

25

its members and says we want x dues and makes the case to them,
and then each month or each quarter someone has to pay that,
8

Heritage

Corporation

1
2

that is dues.
QUESTION:

So your answer to my question is, no

3

matter what they use it for, including retirement benefits

4

available only to union members, so long as they do it through

5

dues, they can get it from the non-union members.

6

MR. GOLD:

That's correct.

7

QUESTION:

No matter what?

8

MR. GOLD:

No matter what.

9

QUESTION:

Annual party or anything at all?

10

MR. GOLD:

Having a party?

11

QUESTION:

Yes?

12

MR. GOLD:

Yes.

Yes.

That is this statute

13

that was the understanding of the time.

14

understanding of the time, let me also point out that at the

15

very time Congress was dealing with this question, it passed

16

what is the precursor of the present Federal Election Campaign

17

Act, which applies to unions and corporations, and prohibited

18

unions from using any portion of their dues or initiation fees

19

or assessments for the purpose of making political expenditures

20

and contributions in Federal elections as those terms are

21

defined in those Acts.

22

In terms of the

So Congress understood quite well that unions use

23

dues for a variety of purposes, and have traditionally funded

24

their activities from dues.

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Gold, what about Judge Murnaghan's

argument that the duty of fair representation as regards these
9

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

non-union members should lead to the result for which he

2

argued.

3

didn't address the substance in the brief of Judge Murnaghan's

4

position.

You dealt with that only in a footnote, but really

MR. GOLD:

5

I had hoped we had dealt with it more, but

6

let me go back to the language of the first proviso of 8(a)(3).

7

The proviso says that nothing in this subchapter or in any

8

other statute of the United States shall invalidate the kinds

9

of agreements that are permitted under this section.

10

Our

position on the duty of fair representation is the following:

11

That the duty of fair representation as implied from

12

Section 9(a) and from the NLRA as a whole, to read the duty to

13

invalidate that which Congress chose after the most careful

14

consideration and heated debate not to invalidate would be

15

contrary to all the theories of statutory interpretation and of

16

elaborating the meaning and purpose of the statute of which we

17

are aware.

18

fair representation and say that union activity, which Congress

19

decided expressly to permit, is invidious or improper under a

20

judge-made rule using the general terms of the duty.

21

We do not believe that you can take the duty of

The duty it seems to us has its metes and bounds

22

delineated by that which Congress specifically decided in this

23

statute to permit as a matter of Federal law, while not

24

prohibiting the States, I would add, from reaching a contrary

25

conclusion.

At the time of the 1947 Act-, twelve States made it

unlawful to have any form of union security, and at the present
10

Heritage

Reporting Corporation

1

time, the number is 20.
QUESTION:

2

But it is a Federal question here.

But certainly the language very similar to

3

that in 8(a)(3) is found in the Railway Labor Act, and this

4

Court has said it just doesn't include collection of dues of

5

that kind against non-members.

6

hurdle to overcome, obviously.

7

MR. GOLD:

And I think that's your biggest

The Court, as Justice O'Connor just

8

stated, does not write on a blank slate here.

This is an issue

9

which has been visited from the Hanson case on through the

10

Hudson case most recently, both under the Railway Labor Act,

11

and under the NLRA.

12

It seems to us that with regard to the NLRA, there

13

are two critical differences that explain why this case is to

14

be decided differently from the RLA case.

15

develop at length in our brief, the starting point for

16

legislative consideration was at the exact opposite ends of the

17

spectrum in this Act, and in the RLA.

18

approached the problem against a background where, as I say,

19

except for twelve States in 1947, all forms of union security

20

including the closed shop which required that an individual in

21

order to get a job in the first place be a full member of the

22

labor organization which had negotiated the agreement were

23

lawful.

24
25

First of all, as we

In this Act, Congress

And there were many who believed that the Federal law
should not invalidate even the closed shop.

It was the view of

the majority in Congress at that time who were operating
11

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

against the fact that the President of the United States did

2

not agree with then and had vetoed legislation in '46, and had

3

said he would veto it again, that union security should be

4

regulated to some extent.

5

the Senate report, the section dealing with union security

6

begins with a phrase to the effect that this is a most

7

contentious issue to which we've given the most mature

8

consideration.

9

And as I said, and if you'll look at

And the conclusion of the sponsors and leaders of the

10

Republican party in the Congress was that the closed shop

11

should be invalidated and that the union shop which provided

12

for dues should continue to be permitted as a matter of Federal

13

law, but not required as a matter of Federal law.

14

continue to be subject to regulation by the States.

15

would like in particular we lay out a good deal of the

16

legislative history but in terms of the sense of what that

17

Congress believed was fair and proper under the circumstances,

18

taking all the realities into account, I think that Senator

19

Taft's statement, which we reproduced on page 33 of our brief,

20

is a particularly succinct summary of the feeling at the time.

And should
And I

21

He said, "the great difference between the closed

22

shop and the union shop is that under the union shop in the

23

first instance, a man can get a job without joining the union

24

or asking favors of the union.

25

have to pay dues to the union seems to me to be much less
important.

The fact that the employee will

Now, different people can reach different conclusions

10

But that was the view at

The closed shop which gave the union authority over

QUESTION:

The union shop which had always required

Mr. Gold, can I ask you a question that

Justice Scalia's question raises in my mind.
Supposing that a District Judge held in this

11

hypothetical example that the amount the excess part of the

12

dues that was used to fund pensions for union members only

13

should not really be considered dues within the meaning of the

14

statute, and therefore enjoined collection of the excess.

15

Would you say that such a holding was tantamount to holding the

16

union shop unlawful.

17

See, you're arguing that the union shop is definitely

18

lawful, and I'm just wondering whether that really addresses

19

the question that Justice Scalia asked.

20

MR. GOLD:

I think there are two questions in terms

21

of what you've asked.

The first would be, is that a fair

22

construction of NLRA Section 8(a)(3).

23

QUESTION:

Right.

24

MR. GOLD:

It is our submission that it is not a fair

25

interpretation of the Statute.

I do not believe that such an

interpretation is in the strict sense invalidating the union

Heritage

13
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

shop in the sense of overturning, while admitting that it is

2

being overturned.

3

construction, in Judge Learned Hand's phrase, is to recreate

4

the gamut of values at the time and the gamut of values at the

5

time was to preserve that which had been in existence up

6

through 1947, which did not permit that kind of limitations.

7

QUESTION:

But I do believe that the task of statutory

But it's conceivable -- I don't know as

8

much history as you do in this area — but it's conceivable

9

that what was known in 1946 was a form of union dues which was

10

used exclusively for things like collective bargaining, and

11

that premiums for the benefit of the membership only and not

12

for non-members would not be treated as union dues within the

13

meaning of the Statute.

14

MR. GOLD:

I can only in that regard since I'm hardly

dissenting opinion in Street with regard to the facts of the

of dues.

MR. GOLD:

Yes.

QUESTION:

So that, I'm really troubled by the

Heritage

14
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

prospect that I gave you in my hypothetical, and what you're

2

saying is that in order to decide this case, we really don't

3

have to decide that hypothetical.

4

certainly anything that dues were used for in 1946 dues can be

5

used for today.

We could just say that

6

MR. GOLD:

Yes.

7

QUESTION:

And if some particular union should come

up with the kind of scheme I just described, which I take it

MR. GOLD:

No.

QUESTION:

can decide that case when it arises.

You'd rather have the whole loaf, I understand.

MR. GOLD:

Well, it isn't rather I'd rather have the

whole loaf or not.

16

a referent was what is uniformly charged to people to be a

17

member of the union and that Congress has regulated how unions

18

spend their monies other ways than this.

19

I believe that what Congress had in mind as

that as a matter of Federal law, all forms of union security

1

RLA that it was fairly possible to read the RLA as only

2

permitting the collection of an amount of money equal to the

3

amount expended for collective bargaining.

4

in our view, in the RLA this Court had determined in the Hanson

5

case that since Federal law preempted all State law which would

6

limit union security and had created a Federal scheme that each

7

union security provision was imbued with Federal law and was

the action of the Government.

Under this Court's decisions, the most recent of

the language and the legislative history of 8(a)(3), both parts

of the language of 8(a)(3), the second proviso which we've

discussed, and the proviso saying notwithstanding any other

20

law, we believe that this agreement which requires each

individual in the bargaining unit to pay the same amount is

indisputably lawful as a matter of Federal law.

MR. VIEIRA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

The argument we've just heard from Mr. Gold is very

interesting as a matter of policy considerations, but I believe

it's somewhat anachronistic as a matter of law.

course, according to his theory, the plain language of the

statute would allow full-fledged membership in a labor

organization to be required by an employer and a labor

25

Of

Well, very early on in the history of Taft-Hartley
Act interpretation, this Court in Radio Officers Union case in

the early 50s, the Court said in fact that wasn't the

was not to allow the type of full fledged membership control

that I think would be required by Mr. Gold's interpretation,

but to force employees to pay a monetary sum to the union.

of dues and fees, the purpose of dues and fees.

I get back then to the question

Obviously, we can't interpret this statute in the
hyper-literalistic way that Mr. Gold suggests, because the

10

Court hasn't interpreted the statute that way.

11

8(a)(3) talks about dues and fees uniformly required as a

12

condition of membership.

talking about here?

That's

And that's what Section 8(d) tells us about

suggest, is a very tightly woven set of provisions.

Collective

bargaining and the majority representatives through 9(a).

11

Section 8(a)(3) agreements when a 9(a) labor organization has

13

And decisions of this Court saying that the

membership requirement so called is a requirement solely

15

directed towards compulsory payment of dues and fees.

16

this makes rather operationally good sense.

17

not a union member and who cannot be required to be a union

member lawfully nevertheless can be required to pay dues and

fees to the labor organization that has been selected,

non-member, by others, to represent him for the purpose of

as an equitable judgment, that the dues and fees should be

service.

Now, once again, the statute sets up a mutual system

Heritage

Reporting Corporation

of liabilities and rights.
QUESTION:

2

Strange way to say that, isn't it?

I mean

3

to say dues and initiation fees if what you're talking about is

4

the costs of collective bargaining?
MR. VIEIRA:

5

Well, Justice Scalia, they said that in

6

the Railway Labor Act in 1951.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. VIEIRA:

9

Congress retrospectively --

It's strange there, too.
Your Honor, this Court has held in

Street, in Allen, and in Ellis that that somewhat strange, at

1

least as we're using the term now, use of terminology leads to

11

the conclusion in Section (2) (4) that only collective

12

bargaining costs can be charged.

13

you raised to Mr. Gold about the retirement benefit program of

14

the types that were union, I recall in Ellis there was not a

15

retirement program, but there was a death benefit program.

16

I think the Court said that if that death benefit program

17

inured only to the benefit of union members, it couldn't be

18

charged.

19

In fact, the question that

And

So we had a situation there where unions, at least in

2

that case it was the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks, did in fact

21

set up out of dues payments a similar type of benefit situation

22

which it did not extend to the non-member.

23

Let's put ourselves in the position of Senator Taft.

24

Does anyone here today really believe that if we had Senator

25

8(a)(3) and then (2) (4) of the Railway Labor Act, and really

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. VIEIRA:

10

I think he might have.

Mr. Gold is nodding his head.
Mr. Gold agrees that he comes to this

not in a position of objectivity.

11

QUESTION:

Mr. Gold's position is that it's better

12

than what the pre-existing situation was where you could be

13

compelled to pay the full dues and also be compelled to be a

14

full-fledged union member.

15

MR. VIEIRA:

Well that's an interesting question as

to what was required under Section 8(a)(3).

17

question begging interpretation from Mr. Gold, because I don't

recall any decision of this Court, certainly, that ever held

19

that 8(a)(3) would have validated the type of thing that CWA

20

has required in this case.

21

22

employers could continue to deal with individual employees,

23

notwithstanding the existence of majority representative in the

We have rather a

for granted that 8(a)(3) would have been interpreted to allow

case.

5

6

deeper and murkier than the one we have here.

7

So I'm not so sure that we can simply take it

In fact, if you took that position, you'd come rather

Let me address that for one moment, because Mr. Gold

8

makes the argument that the interpretation of Section (2) (4) of

9

the Railway Labor Act was somehow impelled by a constitutional

10

consideration which he finds in pre-emption under Hanson.

11

recall, Mr. Justice Brennan's opinion said that it was not

12

merely a fairly plausible interpretation, but a quite

13

reasonable interpretation of Section (2)(4) that limited dues,

14

fees, and in that particular statute, assessments to the costs

15

of collective bargaining.

16

reasonable in the RLA context, I don't see why the same

17

language is not capable of that interpretation in the National

18

Labor Relations context, especially when you go back and look

19

at the statements that were made by Senator Taft as well as

20

others that they were attempting to do in the 1951 Amendment to

21

the RLA, essentially the same thing they had done in the '47

22

Amendment, or at least put the Railway Labor Act unions in the

23

same position, as the National Labor Relations Act unions.

QUESTION:

And what is the argument, then,

That makes a lot of sense and the States

can do that under the current law, if they want to, can't they.

Whereas under the Railway Labor Act, that eminently sensible

21

disposition could not be required by any State, could it?

22

Unless the Federal law required it, nothing could require it.

23

Whereas here, it makes sense, as you say, but the States can do

24

it, if they want.

25

MR. VIEIRA:
QUESTION:

Well, that's true.
And that's a big difference between this
23

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

and the Railway Labor Act.
MR. VIEIRA:

2

Well, it's a big difference in the sense

3

that the States have the ability to interfere in this Act, and

4

therefore we don't have a primary jurisdiction problem that we

5

might have otherwise, but I'm not sure it's so important in

6

terms of the effect between the employee and the union, for

7

instance, in a State like California, which doesn't have such a

8

provision, doesn't have a Right to Work law.
California was the source of the Ellis case.

9

I think

10

on CWA's interpretation that pre-emption somehow has the

11

controlling force over whether the statute should be

12

interpreted to limit dues and fees to collective bargaining

13

costs, one would seriously question whether the statute would

14

have been interpreted that way in a California case.

15

why doesn't the statutory interpretation change under the

16

Railway Labor Act depending on whether you're in a right to

17

work or a non-right to work State?

I mean,

That brings us back to this Hanson point that Mr.

18
19

Gold made.

I don't think the statutory construction in Street

20

depends upon the exclusive reading of Hanson that Hanson was a

21

preemption case.

22

was the argument raised by the Nebraska Supreme Court, the

23

exclusive argument, I take it the Nebraska Supreme Court raised

was they had to decide that case because there was Federal

preemption.

9

Railroad, the Court was very concerned there that a union with

exclusive representational status could use that status through

collective bargaining to discriminate against non-union

employees.

In that case, it was a racial situation.

QUESTION:

MR. VIEIRA:

Absolutely.

It was just the kind of

case theoretically that we have here, cooperation between the

In that case, it was a racial discrimination case.

has been empowered by Congress with a quasi-legislative status.

And if some limitation is not put on the exercise of power

MR. VIEIRA:

the Statute given in Street was perfectly reasonable.

know that the statute limits the services that can be forced on

MR. VIEIRA:

Not if they keep their books straight.

I think the record in this case shows that what happened with

he's correct, if the union has not in fact charged John Jones.
