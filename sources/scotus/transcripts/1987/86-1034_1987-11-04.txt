ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD BAIN '£>MTTH"> ESQUIRE
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, members of the

Court, may it please the Court, we are here this morning

10

on a case involving a 1985 amendment to a virqinia statute

11

shielding the exposure of juveniles to certain sexiially

12

explicit material by regulating the manner of its display,

13

and despite outward appearances, frankly, from reading both

14

sides' briefs, I would suggest to this Court that the issue

15

in this case is really very simple, because we really have

16

one issue, and the issue turns on the type of material that

17

this amendment affects.

18

Now, from the start of this litigations from

19

literally the first page of the transcript, the plaintiffs

20

in this case have painted a picture of a statute with a

21

very broad range effect, a range of material involving

22

material with great beauty and qreat literarv value, a

23

range of material thaty they include James Joyce's Ulysses,

24

William Faulkner's Sanctuary, and even the Penguine Book of

25

Love Poetry, which is an anthology of all the qreat noems
3

of the English lanquage from Robert Browning to Mfred Lord

2

Tennyson.
If that range is correct, if they are correct

3
4

that this amendment involves that material, then we lose

5

the case, and I submit to the Court that we should lose

6

the case, because the Commonwealth of Virginia does not

7

desire to restrict in any way, directly or indirectly, that

8

type of material.

9

But by©the same token, if the material affected

10

is not this broad range, then I would submit to the Court

11

that the plaintiffs cannot prevail, because every burden

12

that they speculate about, every terrible effect that they

13

speculate about, all of their evidence in the District Court,

14

everything in their brief, and 1 am sure everything that Mr.

15

Bator is going to say this morning turns on that concept of

16

this broad range material, and I would say —

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. SMITH:

19

This is a facial attack, is it not?
Yes, Justice Brenner, it is a facial

attack.
I would submit to the Court that the statute they

20
21

are attacking, the statute involving this broad range of

22

material is a hypothetical statute.

Mr. Smith, did the state concede at the

Justice O'Connor, I am sure today that

the day that I die my tombstone is going to say "Bichard B.
Smith said Hollywood Wives was obscene." T have said it over
and over again.

What we said was, one of their witnesses

said, of all the exhibits that-they put in, of all their
exhibits, that was the only one that she said she thought
children should not see. „ And so in the Court of Anneals and
the brief, I think it was in a footnote, I said, of-all the
exhibits, that was the only one that might be involved based
on what she had said.

I have since gone back — I came up,

I looked through all the exhibits.

Mot one exhibit they have

submitted falls within this statute, including Hollywood
Wives.
Now, what we suggest to the Court this statute
involves is not this broad range of conceded beauty,
conceded literary value, of very narrow range.
deals with borderline obscenity.

This statute

It deals with exactlv

the same thing that Ginsburg v. New York dealt with,
borderline obscenity.
QUESTION:

Well, what is your noint, that the

appellees had no standing below?
MR. SMITH:

Justice O'Connor, I would submit that —

I agree with what Mr. Bator said in his brief, that really the
standing question and the merits question here turn on the
5

same thing.

If the material they are talking about is this

2

broad range, then they have standing, because concededly that

3

is the type of material that they are displaying and have

4

been selling to

5

are talking about.

juveniles, and we concede that, what they

6

But the point is that the burden that they have

7

suggested exists here is that because of this broad range

8

i.t is impossible for them to be able to comply with thg..

9

statute both financially and otherwise without' putting them­

10

selves out of business, or at least severely restricting

11

their business.

12

First Amendment rights and rhe First Amendment rights of

13

adults will be overly restrictive.
And that, I think, is the importance of this

14
15

And because of that, they — both their

broad range effect, because if we are talking about this

16

narrow range of borderline obscenity, for one thing, there

17

is nothing in the record to indicate that there is any

18

burden whatsoever olaced on them by that type of material.
And secondly, I would suggest to the Court that

19
20

21
22
23

that is —
QUESTION:

Well, how are we supposed to decide

that, by looking at the words of the statute?
MR. SMITH:

I would suggest to the Court two ways.

24

First, the amendment and the definitional statute,

25

becaus that is something that the olaintiffs have ourposely
6

Acme Reporting Company
(20 2)

1

ignored in this case.

It is something that their witnesses

2

below were never shown, was the definitions of the material

3

involved in this

4

the face of the statute and their evidence supports that

5

there is this narrow range, and I say that for this reason.

case.

And I would submit that both from

The definitions involved here are the same ones

6
7

that the statute in Ginsburg versus New York used.

8

just any sex', any sexual content that is -in a book.

9

that is where they have made their big mistake.

It is not
And

They have

10

assumed all the way through that if there is any sexual

11

content whatsoever, then this material falls within our

12

amendment.

13

QUESTION:

Where did this case come from, what

MR. SMITH:

District Court in Alexandria, and

16

then up to the Fourth Circuit.

14

court?

17
18

QUESTION:

of the breadth, the reach of the statute?
MR. SMITH:

19

20

Didn't those courts have some view

They never really focused on it.

District' Court never discussed —

21

QUESTION:

Well, they must have had some

22

notion of what the reach was to do what they did to the

23

statute.

QUESTION:

With the breadth of the statute?

16

MR. SMITH:

They never discussed one way or

17

the other.

Georgia in which evidence there dealt with a statute that

what —
QUESTION:

Well, I assume that if we found that

22

the Court of Appeals or the District Court — the Court of

23

Appeals defined this statute more broadly than you do, we

24

might very well take the Court of Appeals view of what the

25

meaning of a state statute is.

As I said, if you take the broad view,

we lose, but I would suqqest that what the Court of Appeals

did —

QUESTION:

Well,, did the 36urt 5f Apoeals take

the broad view?
MR. SMITH:

What they did was, they said, we

7

assume that there are these burdens.

8

construing the statute one way or the other, and I would

9

submit to the Court that even if the Court of Appeals had

They never qot into

10

actually gotten to the statute, we are asking this Court

11

to look at it a second time, because we are suggesting

12

that it is a matter of law, not as a matter of fact.

13

QUESTION: Did you ask the District Court: to

14

abstain in order to obtain construction of this from the

15

Virginia courts?

16

MR. SMITH:

There was a request for an extension.

17

We were — the Attorney General's office was brouqht into

18

this case on the certification of 2403(b).

19

other defendants and all the defendants did ask the District

20

Court to abstain.

21

Court refused to abstain was because he said there was no

22

unclear parts of the statute, and yet for the last two years

23

both the plaintiffs and the state have been arguing over

24

the meaning of all these terms.

25

One of the

And ironically, the reason the District

QUESTION:

Now, did you raise that question in the
9

Acme Reporting Company
i 20 2) 620 -4888

1

Fourth Circuit, the District Court's failure to abstain?
MR. SMITH:

2

We raised the question of the District

3

Court should have applied the narrowing constructions of the

4

statute.

5

should have abstained in the sense of Abstention Doctrine.

6

We were arguing that under the First Amendment overbreadth

7

test the District Court should have narrowed the construction.
QUESTION:

8

9

We did not in so many words say the District Court

points.

Well, those are two quite different

So you didn't, preserve the absention argument, did you
MR. SMITH:

10

The plaintiffs say we did.

The Plaintiff

11

say we have been arguing — that is what we have been arguing

12

all along, and the Court of Appeals did in fact say that

13

abstention — they addressed the issue and said absention

14

was not appropriate.
QUESTION:

15
16

they passed on it.
MR. SMITH:

17
18
19

The Court of Appeals decided that —

They passed on it, if I am not

mistaken.
QUESTION:

Didn't the Court of Anpeals accented

20

the District Court's finding that this statute would

I thought it accepted a finding that

done in any case.

3

oresented below is so minimal that we can't make a determina­

4

tion from' what the District Court —

The Fourth Circuit said the evidence

QUESTION:

MR. SMITH:

7

QUESTION:

8

9

>■

I have never seen this

Of what?
Of the percentage of books involved.
But the District Court found that.

MR. SMITH:

The District* Court made that, finding.

Then the Court of Appeals- say, but we assume that it does,

10

and then they went off on this tangent on the statute in

11

Georgia that has a completely different statute than

12

Virginia's, but I would suggest to the Court that the reason

13

that this stature deals with borderline obscenity and not

14

this broad range, as I said earlier, it is from the face

15

of the statute, it only involves certain very narrowly

16

restricted types of activities.
QUESTION:

17

It has to have —

May I just go. back to Justice White's

18

question for a minute?

In Footnote 9, the Court of Appeals

19

ends the footnote, saying, "The District Court found that a

20

significant percentage of the inventory of the average

21

general bookstore varying between 5 and 25 percent falls

22

within the amendment's restrictions."

23

My qiiestion is, did you ask that the Court of

24

Appeals set aside that finding as clearly " erroneous on

25

appeal?
11

Acme Reporting Company

1

appeal?
MR. SMITH:

2

3

QUESTION:

Because if you didn't should we not

accept that as a factual determination?
MR. SMITH:

6

7

I honestly cannot

remember.

4
5

I cannot remember.

If you read on with the footnote,

Justice —

8

QUESTION:

That is the end of the footnote.

9

MR. SMITH:

If you read on with the footnote,

10

they say, and the state said there is a very miniscule

11

amount of material involved.

12

QUESTION:

Yes, you argue that, and then the

13

last sentence is the one that the District Court found 5

14

to 25 percent.

15

MR. SMITH:

Right, and the Fourth Circuit never

16

said who was right, and when you go back up to what that is

17

footnoted to, the Fourth Circuit said, whatever, we are going

18

to assume that there is this broad range, and they cited to

19

this case in Georgia that is a completely different statute

20

involving a completely different range of material.,

21

QUESTION:

Let me just put it this way.

Is it

22

correct that your position in this Court depends on our

23

disagreeing with the District Court's finding of facts?

24

MR. SMITH:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.
So if it is 25 percent, you lose.

MR. SMITH:

QUESTION:

Yes.
Well, you call that a finding of

MR. SMITH:

QUESTION:

No, sir.
Are you sure that is a finding of fact?

QUESTION:

Does it know how many cows there are

in Virginia?
MR. SMITH:

This Court has made it clear for

16

the last three decades that the question of what is obsecene

17

in a book is a matter of law, not as a matter of fact.

18

you have to remember—

19

QUESTION:

I am not talking about what is obscene.

20

I am talking about what the statute covers.

21

question of fact, what books the statute covers, whether

22

obscene or not?

MR. SMITH:
a question of law.
QUESTION:

But it certainly has to be based on

the evidence

MR. SMITH:

3

QUESTION:

It was based on —
I mean, a court isn't going to find

4

what percentage of books in a bookstore are covered bv

5

the statute without — even if it knows what the statute

6

means, it has got to know what books are in the store.

7

MS. SMITH:

It was based on an assessment of

8

two things.

First, the J>ist-??±ct Co«rt said based upon the

9

plaintiff's testimony and the exhibits, and the Court's

10

review of the exhibits, I am submitting to the Court that as

11

far as the exhibits are concerned, that is clearly a matter

12

of law whether they are obscene for juveniles.

13

QUESTION:

All right, so say it is a matter of law.

14

Then what do we do with what the Court of Anneals did to

15

the District'Court's statement of the law?

16

MR. SMITH:

Well, there again, they never really

17

said what — they had that in the footnote.

They just threw

18

it out that that is what the District Court said, but if you

19

read the actual text of the case, they didn't accept it.

20

just said, we are going to assume this, and they have a foot­

21

note, and the footnote says, well, the District Court says

22

this, and the state says that.

23

Court, they never say

24

we are going to assume it is based on what happened in

25

Georgia, which is a completely different situation than

They never say the District

the state was wrong, they just say,

Virginia.
QUESTION:

In order to decide what percentage of

3

one's inventory is affected by a statute, you need to know

4

first what the inventory consists of, and second, what the

5

statute means, don't you?

6

MR. SMITH:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and I would

7

submit to the Court, which was the point I was trying to get

8

to with-Justice White, as far as the evidence presented, it

9

was based on the testimony of two bookstore owners who

10

admitted on cross examination that they didn't have the

11

faintest idea what the definitions were.

12

testimony as to all of the material affected was given in a

13

complete vacuum.

14

All of their

There was no basis for it.

There was, and I will, if I could for just a

15

moment, this is indicative of both testimony directly from

16

the appendix, and it will be very short.

17

QUESTION:

Before you do that, may I just —

18

MR. SMITH:

19

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Even if the witnesses didn't understand

20

what the statute means,

MR. SMITH:

QUESTION:

2

Well, you also there are suggesting

3

that the plaintiffs who tried this case, those lawyers

4

really didn't understand what was going on, that they

5

really failed in their proof.
MR. SMITH:

6

right, they' failed in' their proof, and I suggest to the

easier if you are

10

going into a federal court and claiming that the state is

11

trying to restrict James Joyce's Ulysses than it is to go

12

in and say the state is frying to restrict Hustler.

13

cannot imagine any other reason why they never showed their

own witnesses the definitions before they testified.

MR. SMITH: Mere nudity in the sense of just a

MR. BATOR:

them as an ordinary nonlawyer would read them, and they gave

MR. BATOR:

It seems to me — again, this goes

really to the interchange I had with Justice O'Connor.

is, it is terribly important to understand that the life of

with the statute, no matter how much percentage of the books,

10

MR. BATOR:

Our point is not that it is impossible

to comply, but that the effect of good faith compliance is

likely to be a very drastic restriction on the free access

Now, there is another problem, Justice O'Connor.
There is a large number of books where it would be disastrous
to say children only.

I mean, I guess I don't even know

quite what that would mean, because there are a lot of books
that are absolutely proper for kids and for grownups, and
they are just general books.

I don't think we can reorganize

the bookshops, this world of books and of intellect in terms
of these tight rules, and really, I think our question is
whether it is constitutional for the government basically to
create an across the board rating system for books, and
there is a great —
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Bator, what if the statute just

said it prohibited allowing juveniles to neruse and examine
material that is harmful to them?
MR. BATOR:

I think that would be a more difficult

case, although that also would create a tremendous problem
for booksellers.
QUESTION:

But it certainly wouldn't be a burden

on the adults, would it?
MR. BATOR:

If the crime were for the booksellers

to allow kids, I think there would be a very serious First
Amendment problem, very much the same sort that the Court had
in the Smith case, because the effect even of that statute
would be to out pressure on the bookseller to self-censor.

If the statute as we argue applies to a large range of

perfectly ordinary literary, serious and popular works, the

3

point about Hollywood Wives, Justice O'Connor, is not for us

4

to wrangle about whether it is covered or not, blit if Hollywood

Wives is covered, then there are hundreds of ordinary best

sellers, potboilers of every sort that are covered here, and

7

in a sense they ought to be covered.

are a lot of books that we do not want the bookseller to sell

12

Well, you concede that the statute,

the old statute that prohibited selling the items to juveniles

is constutional?

Yes.

It does put a burden on the bookstore —

material that you can't sell to them?
MR. BATOR:

22

We have two answers to that, Justice

O'Connor.

24

the case of the display statute is more onerous, because you

have to do this

We think that the burden on the bookseller in

but the really important point is that complying with the

2

burden in the display context is much more dangerous to the

First Amendment because it restricts the access of adults.

Complying with the burden with respect to sales has no impact

on adults at all.

May I ask you a question, Mr. Bator?

Does your argument really focus on the fact that the sta,tute

13

MR. BATOR:

QUESTION:

The statute does apply to both.
I understand it does apply to both.

15

Would you have any objection, or does your proof support

16

any objection to a statute which just excluded the written

17

material?

18

MR. BATOR:

Well, Your Honor, that would be a more

19

difficult case, and it is not our case, and I would hope

20

very much that the Court would not on this record and with

21

these briefs try to answer that question.

22

would, however, be, if you push me to the corner of saying,

23

that the Court's cases do not support and the First Amendment

should not support a lesser protection for pictures than for

QUESTION:

Mr. Bator, may I follow up on Justice

O'Connor's question about whether the statute would be all

right if it merely prohibited permitting juveniles to browse

as opposed to requiting you to segregate materials in a

9

fashion so that it is impossible for them to browse?

Do we

10

have any reason — is it clear that the statute requires any

11

more than that?

12

act it says "It shall be unlawful to knowingly display

13

for commercial purpose in a manner whereby juveniles may

14

examine and peruse."

15

If you look at the definition of unlawful

Now, "may" could well mean two things.

It could

16

mean it is possible for them to do so or it could mean it is

17

permitted for them to do so, so it may well be that all that

18

is necessary under the statute is a sign in the store that

19
20

says juveniles not permitted to browse.
MR. BATOR:

Well, Your Honor, I don't think a

21

sensible bookseller in the local community faced with the

22

possibility of local police and local prosecutors would

23

read the statute that'way.

24

It says any display.

25

The statute prescribes display.

The statute also has a definition of

"knowing display," the definition of "knowingly" says that
