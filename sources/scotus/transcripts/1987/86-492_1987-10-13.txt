ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS STANTON FRANECKE

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. FRANECKE:

10

was killed in the crash of a Sikorsky CH53D helicopter.

The

11

helicopter crashed into the sea due to the negligent design and

12

subsequent repair of the steering mechanism of that Sikorsky

helicopter.
As the helicopter sank, LT David Boyle drowned

the record at the Joint Appendix page 450 at the trial.

Respondent did not object pursuant to Rule 51 to that jury

Virginia Logan burden of proof.
Respondent appealed to the Fourth Circuit, but

3

Respondent did not challenge the Government contractor defense

4

as given by the trial judge in the trial jury charge.

5

the Fourth Circuit sua sponte reversed the jury verdict based

6

on (1) the Logan Case in Virginia, and (2) based on a new

7

version of the Government contractor defense just articulated

8

on the same day in the Fourth Circuit case of Tozer.

9

However,

Now, in this Court, we, the Appellant, ask that the

10

jury verdict be reinstated.

11

Sikorsky's only response is an unsupportable Government

12

contractor defense and a disagreement with the sanctity of the

13

jury verdict.

14

We further ask and point out the

Appellant, therefore, asks this Court to decide on

Appeals would have been foreclosed from ordering a new trial on

the basis of the Right Rule of Law?

4

MR. FRANECKE:

QUESTION:

6
7

Certainly not, Justice White.

Well, isn't that what you were just

arguing?
MR. FRANECKE:

What I am arguing, however, is that

QUESTION:

Well, that may be so, but you would say

that the Fourth Circuit could not give the benefit of the

Correct Rule of Law to a person who had approved the

instruction.

17

Is that it?

MR. FRANECKE:

Is that sort of an estoppel?
I am, of course, arguing that the

18

Fourth Circuit's interpretation of what it feels was the

19

correct of Rule of Law was incorrect.

22

QUESTION:

I know.

But assume it was right.

the Court of Appeals was quite right.
MR. FRANECKE:

3

MR. FRANECKE:

4

QUESTION:

5

But the court could have

Yes, it could have.

Based on the correct rule, even though

your opposition had approved the instruction.

6

MR. FRANECKE:

Absolutely.

7

The third issue that I would ask this Court to decide

8

is should there be a Government contractor defense in any form?

9

It is the Appellant's contention that based on several reasons,

10

law and congressional intent that there should not be a

11

Government contractor defense enacted in the Circuits and in

12

the Federal Common Law.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Franecke?

14

MR. FRANECKE:

15

QUESTION:

Yes.:

In your reasons for granting the writ in

16

your petition for sui juris, it strikes me your entire argument

17

there is devoted to what is the Government contractor defense.

18

Did the Fourth Circuit get it right?

19

fact, I can see nothing at all to the fact that the Government

20

had approved a jury instruction.

21

MR. FRANECKE:

And almost nothing, in

If you will look at also the reply

brief, Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, the reply brief does

23

address this particular issue specifically.

response to the petition.

MR. FRANECKE:

1

That is correct.

The reply brief by

2

the Appellant does address this particular issue.

3

fact, you do beg the question that on the fourth issue that I

4

ask this Court to decide is if this Court, by a majority rule,

5

decides that a form of the Government contractor defense should

6

be enacted, what form should that take?

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. FRANECKE:

9

Now, addressing the first issue —

And, in

QUESTION:

MR. FRANECKE:

12

QUESTION:

Adopted.

May I ask?
Yes, Justice Brennan.

You said that there ought under no

13

circumstances in any context be a defense — contractor

14

defense?

15

MR. FRANECKE:

16

QUESTION:

I believe that that is correct.

Even, for example, if the Government has

17

required by order, compelled, the building of a helicopter

18

precisely in the shape this was in?

19

MR. FRANECKE:

First of all, of course, Justice

20

Brennan, it must be looked at to determine whether or not it

21

was time of war or some national emergency where Congress has

22

specifically acted and said, "This is what we have to do."

23

However, the Government contractor defense that we

24

are dealing with here is a civil question and, in most cases,

25

is dealing with a item of equipment which has not been procured

for specific time of war application.
QUESTION:

2

3

In fact, as even says —

What you are telling me is when this

helicopter — it was not time of war, I gather.
MR. FRANECKE:

4

It was built in 1968 in an undeclared

5

war in Vietnam, I believe.

6

also that the defect that was alleged —

7

QUESTION:

However, the issue in this case is

Yes, but what I am trying to get at is, to

8

understand your position, it is that no matter what the

9

circumstances, that the manufacturer may build the helicopter

10

even if they are given all the plans and all the design and

11

everything else by the Government and said, "Do it this way.

12

No other way."

They still do not have a defense?

MR. FRANECKE:

13

I believe the answer is the question,

14

the basic question to the Government contractor defense is:

15

Does the Government truly know what it is buying.

16

words, if they were given the plans and the specifications as

17

you say --

18
19

QUESTION:

In other

Then I gather your answer to me is, yes,

that is your position?

20

MR. FRANECKE:

21

QUESTION:

That is my position.

That is correct.

Now, you are saying that is a position, I

22

take it, as a matter of Federal law, there is no such defense.

23

Would it not be possible that as a matter — I guess this is a

24

case applying Virginia tort law; is it?

25

MR. FRANECKE:

It was tried under Virginia tort law,

;

QUESTION:

Is it not possible that Virginia might

3

recognize a defense on behalf of a defendant who was just

4

obeying orders and didn't do anything independently?

5

MR. FRANECKE:

It is entirely possible that that

6

could be an interpretation in the individual states.

7

I would also point out to the Court that our system of tort law

8

under negligent strict liability and breach of warranty already

9

covers all of the elements that are already contained within

However,

this proposed Government contractor defense.

11

Federal law.

QUESTION:

So, all the

18

Somebody else designed it; namely, the

MR. FRANECKE:

That would be a

That is a central issue of the

19

Government contractor defense but it comes back to whether or

20

not the Government truly was informed or truly had the

21

knowledge that it was buying a defective product and what that

22

defect was.

23

position that the Government does have the right to buy it and

24

it would be a form of assumption of the risk, if you will.

25

they could accept it under those circumstances.

In that case, then it would be Appellant's

So,

But there are

1

several steps that have to be taken.
QUESTION:

2

Who assumes the risk?

I mean somebody who

3

is not -- let's assume somebody who is not in the Government is

4

hurt, does he assume the risk?

5

MR. FRANECKEi

I don't understand.

No, he does not.

And that is also

6

part of the central problem with this whole Government

contractor defense, Justice Scalia.

8

under the law — a civilian can easily sue a Government

9

contractor if he is riding in a military aircraft or a military

product.
QUESTION:

11

Take this hypothetical:

Suppose —

12

imagine the days when the Post Office was actually a Government

13

agency and the Post Office buys a whole bunch of right-hand

14

drive vehicles so he can put the stuff in the mailboxes.

15

that is obviously a dangerous place to have the steering wheel.

16

Right?’

17

accident occurs with a private vehicle on the street and the

18

manufacturer who made these defective vehicles with right-hand

19

drive is sued by the person who is hurt by the accident.

20

manufacturer has no defense?

It is apparent.

21

MR. FRANECKE:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. FRANECKE:

Now,

The Government orders it, though.

An

That

That manufacturer --

If the state chooses to allow such a suit.
First of all, that manufacturer has

every defense that is afforded to them under negligent strict

liability and breach of warranty.

QUESTION:

1
2

Oh, yes, it is negligent to drive on the

right side of a vehicle.
MR. FRANECKE:

3

But the point is they can then show

4

that the Government in fact said, "That is where I want that

here it is."

That comes under negligence. The contractor isn't

10

contractor warn the Government of all of the inherent risks of

11

the right-hand drive so that the Government can make an

12

intelligent choice.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Franecke, what was the basis of

14

Federal jurisdiction in this case?

15

citizenship?

16

MR. FRANECKE:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Was it diversity of

Yes, it was diversity.

So, the Fourth Circuit is simply applying

Virginia law?
MR. FRANECKE:

It was by agreement because the

20

aircraft crashed within one and a half miles, the Death on the

21

High Seas Act did not apply.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

So, Virginia law applied.

And, so, we are just basically reviewing a

question here of Virginia tort law?
MR. FRANECKE:

No, we are reviewing here, I believe,

the whole issue of the Government contractor defense.

QUESTION:

1

2

Well, what is the source of law?

Is it

Virginia law?

3

MR. FRANECKE:

4

QUESTION:

Well, I mean answer my question.

5

you:

6

Or do you answer it, no?

Is it Virginia law?

MR. FRANECKE:

7

Only because —
Tasked

Do you answer that question, yes?

I answer that it was the Federal law

8

as announced by the various Circuits prior to this case in

9

articulating the Government contractor defense.

10

QUESTION:

And what is the source of the Federal law?

11

MR. FRANECKE:

Source of the Federal law goes back to

12

the Agent Orange case in the Eastern District of New York in

13

the McKay v. Rowell out of the Ninth Circuit.
QUESTION:

14
15

And what is the source that they say the

Federal has in those opinions?
MR. FRANECKE:

16

They go back historically to the

17

Yearsley Case which came out, I believe, in 1940, which was a

18

question, to answer Justice Scalia's question where the

19

Government specifically formulated construction plans for a

20

dam.

21

QUESTION:

No, I don't mean the substance of the

22

defense, but we are dealing with a case that ordinarily would

23

be decided strictly under Virginia law.

24

is a Federal element in it here.

25

MR. FRANECKE:

And you say, no, there

That is correct.

12

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

QUESTION:

1

The Fourth Circuit had to apply a

2

particular rule as to Government contractors, even though

3

perhaps the Supreme Court of Virginia wouldn't.

4

that?

5

MR. FRANECKE:

And why is

Because they evidently, the Circuit

6

Courts feel that there is an overriding Federal interest

7

involved here because the Sikorsky helicopter was a Federal

8

product — correction:

9

Federal Government.

It was a contractor who sold it to the

It was a Marine who was killed in this

10

particular crash and we had an overriding question of other

11

circuits which had announced forms of the Government contractor

12

defense and the trial judge believed that a Government

3
4

contractor defense should be given.
QUESTION:

You know, but I realize the trial judge,

5

but I would like to hear more from you about why this is — why

2

QUESTION:

Or Yearsley?

3

QUESTION:

What about Clearfield Trust?

4

QUESTION:

What about Yearsley?

5

MR. FRANECKE:

Yearsley may.

I think, though, the

6

Feres/Stencel Doctrine is actually a closer articulation in

7

modern times of what the actual question is.

8

In Yearsley, there was such a specific compulsion by

9

the Government to build the particular dam a specific way, that

10

the contractor had absolutely no discretion, assuming he didn't

11

do it negligently.

12

The dam failed.

13

build it that way."

14

And, in fact, he didn't do it negligently.

And he said, "Well, the Government told me to

That is, in a sense, an extension of what we are

15

dealing with here under the Government contractor defense, but

16

the Feres/Stencel Doctrine aeems to be the overriding policy

question that we are dealing with here as to whether or hot a

18

Serviceman has the same rights as you and I do if they are

19

using a defective product that is not in a combat situation in

20

time of war.

*

21

QUESTION:

Why isn't the overriding Federal question

22

the ability of the Federal Government to determine the

23

incidence of Federal contracting which include not just the

24

rights between the Government and the contractor, but the

25

extent to which, on the basis of this contract, the private

14

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1

contractor can be held liable to a third party. So, in other

2

words, Clearfield Trust is what brings us into all of this.

3

Just because a state chooses to eliminate the doctrine, the old

4

doctrine of the necessity of privity of contract before any

5

defect in the product can be sued upon, just because a state

6

chooses to eliminate it, the Federal law of contracts does not

7

necessarily eliminate it.

8
9

MR. FRANECKE:

That is also true, Justice Scalia.

think that is a good point.

I

I think, however, it comes back to

10

the question of whether we have a judiciary question here or

11

whether we have a congressional or legislative question.

12

that seems to be because this is the first time that this Court

13

has heard the Government contractor defense as to on what basis

14

it should be construed.
QUESTION:

15

And

Well, all the Courts of Appeal, without

16

exception, who have addressed it, have recognized some form of

17

Government contractor defense; have they not?

18

MR. FRANECKE:

19

QUESTION:

20

That is correct, Justice O'Connor.

No Court of Appeals has just totally

rejected it, as you would have us do?

21

MR. FRANECKE:

I think that there have been various

22

rejections of forms of it and that seems to be the main issue,

23

here.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. FRANECKE:

Well, they have all accepted a defense.
Yes.

QUESTION:

There are different formulations of it.

2

You are here saying, "Don't recognize any Government contractor

3

defense at all."
MR. FRANECKE:

4

That is correct. And I think that

5

there are ample reasons why it should not be a form of any

6

defense.

7

should be questioned is:

8

Feres/Stencel doctrines of a special relationship of the

In other words, a special defense for a

QUESTION:

13

Why is it based on Feres, necessarily?

14

You have been calling it the Government contractor defense, not

15

the defense contractor defense?
MR. FRANECKE:

16

It seems to be the closest analogy

17

that we have come to in our research to try to understand what

18

policy considerations are to be or should be considered by the

19

Court.

20

QUESTION:

Oh, I think the policy considerations are

21

the ability of the Government to determine the incidence of

22

Government contracts — of a Government contract. Now, you have

23

in the Federal Tort Claims Act an immunity that is retained for

24

the Government with respect to discretionary functions.

25

MR. FRANECKE:

Heritage

Yes.

16
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

QUESTION:

And that, it seems to me, goes down the

2

tube once you say that although the Government can't be sued,

3

whenever the Government buys anything from a contractor, as it

4

universally does, especially in the military field, the
Government can end up paying the bill indirectly because,

6

although the discretionary function can't be brought home to

7

the Government, it can to the contractor.

8

price goes up. It is just the same as if we didn't have that

9

provision in the Tort Claims Act.

io
11

The contractor's

Why isn't that a Federal

policy that is served, quite apart from Feres.
MR. FRANECKE:

Without addressing the discretionary

12

function portion of the Federal Tort Claims Act, there are

13

several empirical evidence that has been brought forth in my

14

briefs regarding the fact that the cost factor is not really an

15

issue. For instance, Congress, we believe, has the purview to

16

enact whatever it may want with regard to military suits

17

against contractors.

18

cost arguments in 1984 in the — I think it's Section 794 of a

19

procurement act cited in my briefs.

The Congress rejected

20

those arguments and in essence said,

"Yes, there might be a

21

slight increase in the cost of the various products, but what

22

has happened in the past is is that we have bought tremendously

23

expensive products and they haven't worked because they weren't

24

designed right in the first place. Isn't it better to spend a

little more in the testing and the design in the first place

However, I

again point out to the Court that every element in the

12

which applies across the board.
QUESTION:

13

Well, it isn't.

It depends on how it is

14

formulated because the general contract specification defense

typically available in state tort law would extend perhaps only

16

to specifications that are very precise and not necessarily to

the kind of situation that may have been involved here where

18

the contractor participates in the design or for a performance

(Laughter.)

5

MR. LACOVARA:

We have used the term military

designedly. The only argument that we are making before this

9

including the contract specification defense to which Justice

10

O'Connor referred, that would apply to providers of civilian

11

12

invoked in this case is that it applies because of the nature

13

of military procurement and the constitutional system under

14

which that process takes place, as well as other doctrines that

this Court has recognized that are unique to the military

MR. LACOVARA:

21

suggesting is that as a corollary of the separation of powers,

QUESTION:

3

But what you are asking us to do, Mr.

4

Lacovara is to formulate a Federal Common Law rule that

5

protects Government contractors in this situation where

6

ordinarily state law would govern.
MR. LACOVARA:

7

That's correct. The Court of Appeals,

8

Mr. Chief Justice, in this case, relied on its separate opinion

9

in a companion case, the Tozer Case, decided the same day by

10

the same panel. In that case, the panel expressly stated in the

11

concluding footnote that this is a matter of Federal Common Law

12

even where the case arises under the diversity jurisdiction.

13

Almost all of the court — all of the Courts of Appeals that

14

have addressed the question have reached that conclusion.
The reasons for treating this as a matter of Federal

15
16

Common Law are similar to those to which Justice Scalia

17

referred.

analogous areas that Federal Common Law does govern.

Are you going to go on with those?

MR. LACOVARA:

21

Mr. Chief Justice.

The Standard Oil Case in which the Court

22

said that the relationship among the United States, its

soldiers and third parties who allegedly injure soldiers is to

24

be governed by Federal Common Law and then, more recently, in

QUESTION:

7

Case, Stencel.

Was it not?

MR. LACOVARA:

8
9

But that was a Federal Tort Claims Act

Yes, but what the Court was deciding

was that the underlying law that would be applied -- indeed, in

10

Stencel, the Court said, "As a matter of Federal law, we will

11

not recognize a claim, a tort claim or an indemnity claim."

12

The Tort Claims Act, Mr. Chief Justice, as you know, simply

13

waives the Government' sovereign immunity and leaves it subject

14

to suit if there is some underlying basis for a claim.

15

QUESTION:

Under the law of a particular state.

16

MR. LACOVARA:

That is correct.

And in this Court,

17

in Stencel Aero, the Court said, "Congress has waived the Tort

18

Claims Act immunity from suit."

19

whether there is a claim for relief that the contractor may

20

assert against the Government.

question is to be determined by Federal Common Law.

against the way the Federal Tort Claims Acts is structured,

MR. LACOVARA:

Congress has decided, because most of

the torts that Congress had in mind were automobile accident

that have to be drawn and that there are conceivable places

that someone might draw the line other than applying Federal

MR. LACOVARA:

That is the single question that has

divided the Eleventh Circuit from the other courts.

2

3

that the defense applies where the contractor either gets

4

specifications promulgated by the Government, which is rare, or

5

participates in the design.

All the other Courts of Appeals have said the issue

11
12

is simply: Does the contractor actually know of something, a

13

hazard in the design about which the Government is ignorant.
QUESTION:

14

25

QUESTION:

If it is a fixed price

And then it could be incorporated in the

MR. LACOVARA:

It depends on the negotiation process.

I think another point on that, really a side light, I think, in

35

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

628-4888

1

terms of the mission before the Court, is that when these

2

contracts were let and when these helicopters were being

3

designed, it was in the 1960's when a liability suit of this

4

sort would have been virtually unthinkable.

5

position 25 years after this contract process began because

6

liability law has evolved far beyond insurance coverage at the

7

time, but I think that is not the real issue on which we reset.

8
9

I was going to emphasize that the only issue before
*
the Court is that one.
In Petitioner's brief before the Court

10

of Appeals, he said on two occasions, and the Cour,t of Appeals

11

took him at his word and expressly reported this in its

12

opinion, that the only issues that were being advanced were the

13

claims that there was a negligent repair of this servo-system

14

and a negligent design of the escape system.

15

that twice in his brief below and that is the way the Court of

16

Appeals characterized the case.

17

We are in this

Petitioner said

I think it is too late now to say that there is

18

another negligent design issue that this Court ought to

19

address.

on page 395 of the transcript was specifically argued as a

21

basis for directing a verdict on the ground that Plaintiff had

22

not borne his burden under Virginia law.

23

the Court of Appeals held on appeal was the case here.

24
25

The Logan Case, the Virginia law burden of proof case

That is exactly what

So, as the case comes before this Court, the only
issue is the one that was framed in the petition:

have explained in our brief why the defense should exist, why

3

it should be recognized as a matter of Federal Common Law and

4

why it is a corollary of important constitutional and legal

5

doctrines.

6

In this kind of suit or any kind of suit, where the Plaintiff

7

is claiming that he is entitled to damages because military

8

equipment has been improperly designed and where the contractor

9

shows that that very feature was approved by the military, what

10

the Plaintiff is asking the Court and civilian jury to do is to

11

say that the military decision to provide him or her with that

12

piece of material was wrongful and should bear consequences.

13

We

At bottom, it is a separation of powers question.

Now, the United States is immunized under either

14

Feres or more generally under the discretionary function

15

exception and the question, therefore, is:

16

backdoor attack on the nature of the military decision by

17

exposing the contractor to liability in tort for the

consequences of the design decision, that the contractor proves

19

MR. LACOVARA:

QUESTION;

Same as here. Everything is the same as

8

here, only it is the rotor and it hurts a civilian instead of a

9

serviceman.
MR. LACOVARA:

10

Okay.

What you have there, Justice

11

Scalia, is a different question, obviously.

Several of the

12

bases for the military contractor defense would involve or

13

could involve immunity under that circumstance, just as the

14

United States would be immune if the decision that the Court

15

would have to make would be to inquire into the soundness, the

16

reasons of the military judgment to design a helicopter with

17

those rotors, you might very well have the same reasons for a

18

defense even where the civilian is injured.
One factor that would not be present that is present

19
20

in this type of case, and it is the typical case involving

21

military accidents is that Congress has another system of

22

compensation that it has set up equivalent to Workmen's Comp

23

system.

24

bases for immunity would apply.

25

So, the balance might be different, but some of the

I have ceded the balance of my time to the Solicitor

MR. AYER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The United States is in this case as amicus because

we believe that the issue here is whether the courts or the

Justice Scalia's question on that point.

3

questions, we must confess. And in that sense, we think the

4

closest area of legal doctrine in terms of an analogy is the

5

area of Federal employee immunity.

6

In that instance, you are talking about protecting

7

the general functioning of the Government and that is an area

8

where this Court has, for years and years, dealt with cases

9

involving questions of whether the balance of the interests of

10

defending the Government functioning, outweigh the Interests of

11

the plaintiffs in that particular situation.

These are balancing

Common Law approach has been the appropriate approach.

Yes, but many of those cases arise under

Section 1983, their construction with Federal statute which

presumptively adopted Common Law rules that were applied, not

18

just a matter of Federal Common Law, but general Common Law.

19

MR. AYER:

Well, that is correct, Your Honor, but

20

many — a number of cases also have not dealt with

21

constitutional principles or 1983. They have dealt with Common

22

Law actions.

believe that the fundamental necessity of allowing the

Government to proceed in the area of sophisticated weapons

systems by the kind of cooperative relationship with private

it possible to say that the defense that we are talking about

is really inherent in the power that has been conferred on the

21

Defense Department and the Services to go forward with

22

And we believe that this is such an area.

Heritage

43

(202) 628-4888

1

I think maybe preemption is a little closer, Justice O'Connor.

2

The idea that the power of the Government to get weapons

3

systems without itself manufacturing all of them is a power

4

that I think it is fair to say is inherent in the power to

5

provide for the national defense.

6

are talking about here. We are talking about complex changing

for the United States Government to set up factories to

manufacture this equipment which changes every few weeks.

And that is really what we

And

10

it is perfectly reasonable to enlist the assistance of private

11

industry in doing that.
Now, the absence of a defense does not absolutely

12
13

prohibit that, but it creates burdens which were alluded to by

14

Justice Scalia, quite correctly:

15

increasing cost, which include delays in the ability to get the

what the Government wants but what state courts in their tort

saying, "We want this."

If the Government can't have that kind of a

4

cooperative relationship, it is going to be impossible to

5

develop the technology that we need on the leading edge of

6

technology around the world.

7

And that is why I say this defense is really inherent
in the power to provide for the national defense.
I would just like to briefly emphasize that we are

concerned that the defense also be limited. We are not

foreclosing a similar defense in later different cases, but

this defense in this case need only and should only be limited

15

system that is special ordered or specific features on a system

16

which is generally available, which are special ordered.

We are not in favor of creating a defense for the

18
