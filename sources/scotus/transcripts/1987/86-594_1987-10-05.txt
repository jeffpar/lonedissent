ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORTON J.

ESQ.

ON BEHAI,F OF PETITIONERS

MR.

9
10

COME,

COME:

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:

11

This case presents two questions. One, whether the

12

withdrawal of an unfair labor practice complaint by the General

13

Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board pursuant to an

14

informal settlement entered into prior to the commencement of

15

the hearing on the complaint constitutes agency action that is

16

subject to judicial review.

17

The second question is whether,

assuming that the

18

GC's action is subject to judicial review,

19

must hold an evidentiary hearing whenever the party who file

20

the unfair labor practice charge objects to the settlement

21

agreement.

22

the General Counsel

Now, before addressing these questions,

I should like

23

to spend a few minutes outlining the statutory scheme and the

24

Board's procedures for implementing it because I think it's

25

important to understanding the resolution of the question.
3

Heritage Reporting Corporation

628-4888

The National Labor Relations Board confers upon the

1

2

National Labor Relations Board authority to prevent any person

3

from engaging in an unfair labor practice affecting commerce,

4

and it sets forth in general terms the procedure to be followed

5

in determining whether an employer or a union has engaged in an

6

unfair labor practice and the appropriate order, therefore.

7

However, Section 3(d) of the National Labor Relations

8

Act provides that the Board's General Counsel, who is a

9

statutory officer appointed by the President with the consent

10

of the Senate, shall have final authority on behalf of the

11

Board in respect to the investigation of unfair labor practice

12

charges and the issuance of complaints in respect the

13

prosecution of such complaints before the Board.

14

Now, the procedure the Board has devised attempts to

15

effectuate this separation that 3(d) makes between the Board's

16

prosecutory authority on the one hand and its adjudicatory

17

authority on the other.
An unfair labor practice charge case is initiated by

.18

19

the filing of a charge.

It's investigated by the Regional

20

Director, and if the investigation indicates the charge has

21

merits, --

22

QUESTION:

Where does the charge come from?

23

MR. COME:

Any person may file a charge.

24
25

In this

case, it was filed by the Food and Commercial Workers Union.
QUESTION:

You mean just any person in the United

States?

2

MR. COME:

Yes, Your Honor.

3

QUESTION:

Whether he's an employer or employee?

4

MR. COME:

That Is correct.

5

filed by the employer or an employee or the union.
QUESTION:

6

7

Usually the charges are

Well, this particular case is one between

two unions, isn't it?

8

MR. COME:

Between two unions and an employer.

9

If the investigation reveals that the charge does not

10

have merit, it is either withdrawn or dismissed, in which case

11

the charging party has an appeal to the Board's General

12

Counsel.

13

he affords an opportunity for a settlement of the charge.

If the Regional Director concludes that it has merit,

At this stage of the proceeding, the settlement is

14
15

usually what is called an informal settlement, which does not

16

require the entry of a Board order or a court decree. It

17

consists of a commitment by the charge party to take the

18

agreed-upon remedial action and the case is closed upon

19

compliance with that commitment.

20

to comply, the charge, the prosecution of the charge can be

21

resumed.

22
23

If, later, there is a failure

Now, if no settlement is reached at this stage, a
complaint issues, and if the complaint goes to hearing, --

24

QUESTION:

25

complaint solution?

Does the Regional Director decide the

5

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

MR. COME:

1

2

The Regional Director does.

He's acting

as the agent of the General Counsel.

3

QUESTION:

He's not the Board's representative?

4

MR. COME:

No, he's not the Board's representative.

5

He -- the statute, as I indicated, gives the Regional Director

fi

final authority over the investigation of unfair labor practice

7

charges.

8

supervision over the employees and the regional offices, and

9

when the Regional Director is working on the unfair labor

The statute also gives the General Counsel

10

practice phase of the proceeding, he is exercising the General

11

Counsel's 3(d) authority.
When he's working on representation cases, which lead

12

13

to elections, he is also working under the supervision of the

14

General Counsel, but, there, the General Counsel has been

15

delegated by the Board the authority to handle representation,

16

supervise the handling of representation cases.

17

respect to the complaint phase, the Regional Director is acting

18

as the agent of the General Counsel.
Surprisingly,

19
20

23
24
25

these things, over time, have been kept

straight, although it may seem difficult to conceive of it.
But if a settlement cannot be reached, as I

indicated,

the case -- yes, Your Honor?
QUESTION:

There's something in the way of a case.

He may try then to effect settlement,
MR. COME:

is that correct?

Yes, Your Honor.

But suppose the party doesn't want to

engage in any settlement discussions, does he have an appeal?

3

MR. COME:

At that point, he issues a complaint.

4

QUESTION:

Oh. The Regional Director issues a

6

MR. COME:

He issues a complaint.

7

QUESTION:

And the party against whom it's issued has

5

dt
w

QUESTION:

complaint.

8

no appeal to the General Counsel before he has to answer the

9

complaint, does he?

10

MR. COME:

Not normally. I mean, the procedure on

11

appeal is usually invoked where a charge is dismissed, but, as

12

I say, after a complaint issues, it may go to formal hearing,

13

but there is usually a two to three month period between the

14

issuance of the complaint and the formal hearing, and during

15

that time, there is further opportunity for settlement of the

16

case or the complaint may be withdrawn because the Regional

17

Director, in preparing for trial, finds that his evidence just

18

won't stand up.

19

Now, under the Board's rules, the Regional Director

20

can withdraw a complaint prior to hearing on his own motion.

21

This is a provision that's been in the rules, even way back in

22

the Wagner Act days.

23

Similarly, as I said, he can enter into a settlement

24

agreement.

25

settlement agreements can be of two forms.

At this stage, the post-complaint stage, the
You can have a

1

formal settlement, which provides for a Board order and often a

2

consent decree, and that goes on up to the Board because it

3

requires a Board order and Board approval.

4
5

QUESTION:

These settlements are provided for by

regulations, aren't they?

6

MR. COME:

Yes,

7

QUESTION:

And both the formal and the informal?

8

MR. COME:

Yes, Your Honor. We have set forth at the

9
10

Appendix to our brief the Board's regulations with respect to
the settlement procedure.

11
12

they are, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Does it indicate how old those regulations

MR. COME:

Those regulations were promulgated many

are?

13
14

years ago.

15

after the start of Taft-Hartley and,

16

years ago,

17

has been a long-standing procedure that was worked out by the

18

Board and the General Counsel right after the enactment of

19

Taft-Hartley in an effort to make 3(d) mesh with the Board's

20

adjudicatory procedures.

21

In general form,

they were in the Act from right
then about twenty-two

they got amplified, but, essentially,

QUESTION:

this procedure

That shows something of the ambivalence of

22

the whole scheme,

though, doesn't it?

You said that the

23

Board's regulations permit the Regional Director to dismiss the

24

complaint before any action is taken, yet you told us earlier

25

that the Regional Director was not the agent of the Board but
8

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

the agent of the General Counsel.

2

If that were purely the case, one would expect the

3

General Counsel to issue some regulations as to what his

4

Regional Directors can do.

5

MR. COME:

Well,

for housekeeping purposes, Congress

6

decided instead of setting up a separate administrator to put

7

the General Counsel in the same agency as the Board, and the

8

way these regulations work out or have worked out is that

9

although they are issued in the name of the Board,

those having

10

to do with the operation of the General Counsel's phase of the

11

administration are worked out jointly with the Board and the

12

General Counsel.

13

these regulations.

14

There is a joint committee that has worked on

What would happen if you got to a point where you

15

couldn't have agreement is an interesting question, but that

16

has not,

17
18

Now, what we have here is not a formal settlement,
but an informal settlement that was worked out post-complaint.

19

20

fortunately, been the case.

QUESTION:

Where there's a formal settlement, any

order of the Board is subject to judicial review,

is it?

21

MR. COME:

That is correct, Your Honor.

22

QUESTION:

And the question we have here is whether

23

where there's an informal settlement,

24

review.

25

MR. COME:

is it subject to judicial

Yes. Informal settlement.

1

3

QUESTION:

Do we have any other issue to decide in

MR. COME:

If, only if, you decide that it is subject

this case?

4

to judicial review, would you have to reach the second question

5

as to whether or not a charging party who objects at the

6

settlement is entitled to an evidentiary hearing on its

7

objections because that is what the 3rd Circuit held and the

8

remand is for the Board to hold such an evidentiary hearing.

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Come,

if the case had proceeded far

10

enough to have a hearing, at that point,

11

to settle the case and dismiss it on the part of the General

12

Counsel alone?

13

MR. COME:

is there any authority

The General Counsel cannot do that

14

unilaterally. Once it goes to hearing,

15

is invoked and the withdrawal of the complaint or any

16

settlement agreement that's entered into would have to be with

17

the approval of the administrative law judge and an appeal lies

18

from that to the Board.

So that what we're really talking about here is a

20

very narrow time span, as it were.

21

of the complaint and prior to the opening of the hearing.

22

23
24
25

QUESTION:

The period after issuance

What's the difference, Mr. Come, between a

formal settlement and an informal settlement?
MR. COME:

The difference is that a formal settlement

leads to a Board order that is enforceable in the Court of
10

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

Appeals, and so that if there is non-compliance with that

2

order, the Board can either proceed to get it enforced on

3

consent or, if there was a consent also to a court decree, move

4

for contempt of the order.

5

With respect to an informal settlement, the only

6

consequence is that the prosecution of the case is stopped, and

7

if there is compliance with the commitment, the case is closed

8

on compliance.

9

is not compliance, then the settlement is withdrawn and the

10

11

If it should subsequently it appear that there

General Counsel is free to resume the prosecution of the case.
QUESTION:

Suppose the General Counsel changes his

12

mind after one of these informal settlements, there hasn't been

13

any violation of the informal settlement by the party with whom

14

it's made, but the General Counsel just decides it was a bad

15

idea, would anything prevent him from going ahead to

16

reinstitute the complaint?

17

MR. COME:

No, I don't think so, Your Honor, because

18

he acts in the public interest here and there's no estoppel, as

19

it were, that would operate against him, but --

20

QUESTION:

Has it ever happened, to your knowledge,

21

that without a violation of the informal consent agreement, the

22

General Counsel just decides --

23
24
25

MR. COME:

I wouldn't say never, but

if it's ever

happened, it's so rare that -QUESTION:

key role in the administration of the Act.

MR.

12

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

However,

that

1

is not to say that if it were established by this Court that

2

there is a right to review and that â€”

3

QUESTION:

Well, there's been a right to review in

4

the 6th Circuit for twenty years without any cases, hasn't

5

there?

6

MR. COME:

In the 3rd Circuit.

7

QUESTION:

3rd Circuit, I mean

8

MR. COME:

In the 3rd Circuit.

QUESTION:

Twenty years, they had this rule, and

10

11

nobody ever

used it for twenty years, isnâ€™t that right?

MR. COME:

But as I say, the potential would be there

12

and human nature being what it is, it is not unreasonable to

13

expect that if there were not only the right to review but also

14

the right to Board review, as my brother here is urging, that a

15

party for technical reasons would play out the string here, and

16

this isn't just a labor versus management-kind of issue because

17

the employer can be in the role of the objecting party as can

18

the union, and experience has shown that in order to resolve

19

most effectively labor-management disputes, the -- it's better

20

to get things resolved

21

certainty and that if you tack on review to an informal

22

settlement, there would be a strong disincentive to settle

23

because one of the reasons for settling is to avoid the cost

24

and also the risk of litigation.

25

uickly and with some degree of

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Come, in the ninety-two percent

informal and what proportion formal?

4

informal settlements and, of those, â€”
QUESTION:

5
5

MR. COME:

Well,

in the 1983 statistics, which we

8

have in our brief, the formal settlements were about six-tenths

9

of a percent of the total number of settlements.

10

informals are really the bulk of the settlements.

11

about sixty-five percent occur before complaint and you've got

12

about thirty-five percent remainder.
QUESTION:

13

14

So, the
Of those,

But in either event, neither is subject to

judicial review, is it, pre or post?
MR. COME:

15

That is correct, with the possible

16

exception that an informal that is entered into after hearing,

17

where you have to get the approval of the administrative law

18

judge and the Board, those â€” there have been two such cases in

19

the 7th Circuit and those have been reviewed.

20

QUESTION:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE GOLD

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

3
4

MR. GOLD:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:

5

As Mr. Come has indicated, the issue here is the

6

reviewability of the settlement that was made over the

7

opposition of the Union which was the charging party, the Food

8

and Commercial Workers Union.

9

The same issue would be presented whether the

10

charging party were a union or an employer. The system works

11

the same way whomever has filed the charge.

12
13

It's our view that what Congress intended in 1947 was
to provide that settlements that are entered into postÂ­
complaint are to be presented to the Board itself and that the

15

requirement is across-the-board whether or not the settlement

16

is labelled informal or formal.

17
18

QUESTION:

doesn't expressly make that clear.

19

MR. GOLD:

No.

Is this not a case where some difference

22

#

Well, Mr. Gold, the statute certainly

MR. GOLD:

In this instance, Your Honor, we do think

23

that the statute pushes very hard in the direction of the

24

position we take and that this is what the understanding was at

25

the time.

It's very difficult to understand exactly how it is
16
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

that the Board has come to the conclusion it has.
Originally,

2

right after the enactment of Taft-

3

Hartley,

the position we urged was the position that was

4

followed by the Board.

5

explanation,

One year later, without any

It's been consistent since then?

MR. GOLD:

Yes,

QUESTION:

Well, do you think that's an unreasonable

8
9
10

11

it has been consistent since then,

but --

interpretation of this language of the statute?
MR. GOLD:

I think that it's an interpretation of the

12

statute which cuts very deeply against the statutory provisions

13

and, moreover, as the discussion thus far has indicated,

14

an interpretation of a statute which has resulted in a number

15

of lines being drawn, none of which seems to have much in the

16

way of logic.

17

it is

First of all, there's a line between an informal

18

settlement and a formal settlement, but an informal settlement

19

is what the General Counsel says it is and the formal

20

settlement is what the General Counsel says that is.

21

Formal settlements do not necessarily create any

22

enforceable rights in court.

23

this system creates.

QUESTION:

that's line number one, which

Line number two is that â€”

(202)

formal settlement only something that results in a Board order

2

in the sense of a command to the parties, and that he considers

3

those Board orders that merely approve the dismissal of the

4

complaint to be not formal settlements but informal

5

settlements.
It's a question of terminology, but T understand his

use of terminology to be as I just described it.
MR. GOLD:

to me, in the sense that under 10(f), it's certainly an order

complaint, and the situation after the complaint issues, in

5

which there is a formal proceeding.

We think that those formal proceedings, as is true in

a variety of formal proceedings, were intended to be terminated

only with the approval of the adjudicatory agency. In other

words, we think that the filing of the complaint and we believe

10

that this was Congress' understanding, clear understanding,

11

that the filing of the complaint was like the filing of a

complaint in court and answer after which you can only withdraw

the case with judicial approval or the filing of a criminal

can only be settled or withdrawn with the approval of the

We think that the intent of

Now, what about an order saying that the Respondent

If it's reviewable, it would be under the

where it should be if there hasn't been any formal proceeding.

16

You need a record to be made.

17

MR. GOLD:

Perhaps it's where it should be if you're

fighting about the substance of the settlement, but if the

claim is that the General Counsel has run around the procedure

20

entirely, so -- and has taken an action which is in reality an

21

action which we believe is an action which can only be taken by

22

the Board, it seemed to us that the logic of the situation was

that kind of law question, when, as well, and ostensibly to the

25

We argue, as an alternative, that the APA gives us a

review and that it's senseless to send us back to the district

Mr. Gold, if the Government is right, I

MR. GOLD:

13
14

That's right.

I mean, unless the Board --

unless the Government's position here is that they can do

15

whatever they want, it seems to me that where we actually are

16

is that the General Counsel has the trump card.

QUESTION:

If he enters

Why shouldn't that be the same trump card

if the proceeding has started, if the hearing has started?
MR. GOLD:

That's what's a total mystery to us and it

21

may be that if you rule for the Board here, the Board will

22

greatly regret having joined hands with the General Counsel.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Gold, take the stage of the proceeding

24

where the General Counsel issued a complaint but the charge

party has issued no response.

Now, you say a settlement even

not like your district court

4

That's where the plaintiff has filed a complaint, the

5

defendant hasn't filed an answer, and that's dismissable at the

6

will of the plaintiff in the district court.
MR. GOLD:

7

That is the rule in the district court,

8

but our argument here is that the statute draws a different

9

line.

10

Obviously, it could draw that line, -QUESTION:

But you were arguing before that you had

11

the same kind of hearing that a district court would have.

12

thought you meant that the proceedings were analogous; they're

13

really not analogous,

14

MR. GOLD:

I

I'm saying that the issues to be presented

15

to the tribunal in this kind of a three-party situation are

16

analogous to the issues on whether or not to approve a

17

settlement in a normal district court case brought by a

18

plaintiff after answer in a class action case brought after the

class is certified, which is very close, because that, too, is

20

one where you have a representative rather than just one party

on the plaintiff's side.

QUESTION:

Those district court case examples have

23

gone considerably further than just the filing of a complaint,

MR. GOLD:

That's true, but it is also true that the
30

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Mr. Gold, the due process concerns that

motivated Taft-Hartley weren't basically concerns about

4

fairness to the charging party, were they?
MR. GOLD:

5

Oh, I think they were, Your Honor, because

6

as the Court has remarked in other circumstances, what was

7

sauce for the goose became sauce for the gander because Taft-

8

Hartley for the first time created charging party rights in

9

employers against unions, and Senator Taft and his colleagues

10

were very solicitous of the rights and interests of that new

11

class of charging parties.

12

Certainly, there was nothing that anybody said or

13

anything that was indicated which would cut back into that.

14

The reason for creating the General Counsel was to keep the

15

Board out of something that was considered not to be a proper

16

adjudicatory function, namely the issuance of complaints, the

17

determination to go forward, but it is a proper adjudicatory

18

function as we've indicated and has always been understood to

19

be such for the tribunal before whom the proceeding is pending

at a certain stage to say whether or net a settlement should be

it.

2

We submit it is clearly unreasonable to conclude that

Congress intended to freeze the situation which would have left

4

prosecutorial authority that the Board was continuing to

exercise still with the Board.
So, the point that Congress intended to freeze the

situation pre '4.7 just doesn't stand up.
QUESTION:

settlements by the General Counsel to be reviewed by the Board?
MR. COME:

11

Mr. Come, could the Board require informal

Not, we believe, certainly prior to the

issuance of the complaint, and --

12

QUESTION:

Well, what about in this very case?

13

MR. COME:

-- post-complaint, I think that the Board

14

could not go back to the point of the issuance of the complaint

15

without doing violence to 3(d) because 3(d) talks about the

16

General Counsel's final authority, extending not only to the

17

investigation of charges and the issuance of complaints, but

18

with respect to the prosecution of such complaints before the

19

Board.

20

22

So, you have to allow some room post-complaint for
the General Counsel's final authority to operate in.
QUESTION:

So, your answer is no, the Board could not

23

require him to get the approval of the Board for informal

24

settlements after the complaint is issued?

25

MR. COME:

At least up until before the hearing

QUESTION:

Well, what -- why wouldn't that same rule

apply to post-hearing while the hearing is going on?

What if

the General Counsel 'wants to settle?
MR. COME:

Well, â€”

QUESTION:

I take it you agree then that the Board

has to agree.
MR. COME:

-- no.

At that point, I think that the

adjudicatory process has commenced and that the Board as the
adjudicator has the inherent authority of all adjudicatory
bodies to regulate the order of proceedings once the
adjudicatory phase has opened, and barring any restriction in
the statute, which there is none here,

the Board was reasonabl

in drawing the line at the opening of the hearing.
Now, my last point is that with respect to â€”
QUESTION:

You mean the Board and the General Counse

was reasonable?
MR. COME:

That is correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Just to settle terminology, do you

consider that a formal settlement or an informal settlement,
where all the Board approves is a dismissal of the complaint,
no order from the Board?
MR. COME:
settlement.

I would regard that as an informal

The formal settlement requires a Board order that

requires a party to do something.

Now,

whether that order provides for enforcement by

Court of Appeals or not does not deprive it of being a formal
settlement because since the order -consented to the order,

the parties have

the Board can go into the Court of

Appeals and get automatic enforcement of that order because
under 10(e)

the respondent has waived his right to contest the

order and we have done that.
My last point is that we read 10(f)

the way you have

suggested, Judge Scalia, as the type of order that
to is a 10(c)

order,

is referred

and that is made even plainer when you

look at 10(e), which is the provision for the Board -CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:
MR.

COME:

Your time

to go for enforcement.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr.

Come,

your time

expired.
MR.

COME:

Right.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:
(Whereupon,

The case is submitted.

the case in the
