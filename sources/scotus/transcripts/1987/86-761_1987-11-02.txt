CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument next in

No. 86-761, Cynthia Forrester versus Howard Lee White.
Ms. Sedey, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY ANN SEDEY, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MS. SEDEY:

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court.
The Petitioner in this case, Cynthia Forrester, sued

10
11

her employer, Judge Howard Lee White, for intentional sex

12

discrimination under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983, when he demoted

13

and then discharged her from her position as Director of a

14

Juvenile Court diversion program and juvenile probation officer

15

for the Jersey County Illinois Circuit Court.

16

The issue for decision in this Court is whether a

17

State Court Judge is engaged in a judicial act and therefore

18

protected from a suit for damages by the Doctrine of Judicial

19

Immunity when he makes a personnel decision regarding a Court

20

employee.

21

We submit that the Seventh Circuit's ruling that the

22

Doctrine of Judicial Immunity bars Cynthia Forrester's claim

23

for damages expands the Doctrine of Judicial Immunity far

24

beyond the limits created by this Court's decisions and beyond

25

the scope necessary to effectuate its legitimate historical

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

4
1
2

purposes.
We ask this Court to rule that a personnel decision

3

is not a judicial act, and that the Doctrine of Judicial

4

Immunity does not bar a suit for damages under Section 1983 for

5

employment discrimination.

6

This Court's prior decisions clearly articulate what

7

is a judicial act.

8

that a judge's decision to fire a court employee does not fit

9

within the category of acts which this Court has defined as

10

I think it's clear from those decisions

judicial acts.

11

The first principle in trying to determine whether or

12

not an act is a judicial act is that that determination must be

13

made on the basis of the characteristics of the act, not the

14

status of the actor.

15

is a judge does not make every act that that person engages in

16

a judicial act.

17

case decided in 1880, Ex Parte Virginia, a case in which the

18

facts were quite similar to the facts of the case of Forrester

19

versus White.

20

judicial acts are acts of adjudication.

21

Court's attention to its decision in Supreme Court of Virginia

22

v. Consumers Union, a 1980 case in which this Court ruled that

23

even an official action taken by a State Court Judge pursuant

24

to explicit statutory authority is not a judicial act when that

25

Judge acts not on parties litigant, and when the act does not

In other words, the fact that the person

arise out of a controversy which is before the Judge for

2

adjudication.

3

I think that these cases together stand for the

4

proposition that Judges are protected by the Doctrine of

5

Judicial Immunity only when they are engaged in acts of

6

adjudication, by that, we mean acts connected with a case, a

7

controversy, a matter before a Judge for a decision by him or

8

her acting as an adjudicator.

9

That principle has also been restated in two other

10

recent decisions of this Court, the 1978 decision in Butz v.

11

Economou and the Court's 1985 decision in Cleavinqer v. Saxner.

12

In the Butz case, this Court held that hearing officers in

13

Federal administrative agencies are entitled to judicial

14

immunity when they are hearing cases and controversies.

15

that decision, this Court noted that the officials in those

16

cases issued subpoenas, ruled on proffers of evidence, make and

17

recommend decisions, and these are acts which are integral

18

elements of the adjudicatory process.

19

things that the hearing officers in these Federal

20

administrative agencies were going to be protected by the

21

Doctrine in connection with were acts of adjudication.

22

In

Again, the kinds of

In Cleavinqer v. Saxner, 1985 case decided by this

23

Court, the question arose whether prison officials acting as a

24

disciplinary committee holding disciplinary proceedings with

25

regard to prisoners were engaged in judicial acts and therefore

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

6

1

protected from suit by these prisoners by the Doctrine of

2

Judicial Immunity, and again, in that case, this Court held as

3

recently as 1985 that when the attributes of judicial

4

proceeding are missing, that there is no judicial immunity.
The decisions of this Court clearly hold that a

5
6

judicial act is an act of adjudication, an act connected with

7

or arising out of a case before a judge for adjudication.

8

judge's acts at issue in this case were two decisions; a

9

decision to demote an employee, and a decision to discharge an

10

employee, basically personnel decisions about a court employee.
Those decisions do not fit within the category of

11

12

acts which this Court has ruled are judicial acts.

13

decisions, no matter what the nature —

MS. SEDEY:

Under the Seventh Circuit's opinion, that

21

would be a judicial act.

22

this Court adopt here, it would not be a judicial act because

23

it wouldn't be arising from a case or a controversy before the

judge for adjudication.

MS. SEDEY:

the judge —

5

QUESTION:

Well, isn't assisting the judge judicial?

6

MS. SEDEY:

She was assisting the judge in carrying

7

out his judicial functions, but the judge's decision to

8

terminate her was not judicial, it was administrative.

9

didn't arise out of any case or controversy before the judge

It

11

12

controversy before a judge for decision is a judicial act, an

13

act of adjudication.

And that's the distinction here that we urge the

like Justice Marshall's, I guess.

Supposing you have in a give

And she brings a lawsuit and says you did it only

20

because you don't like women, you like them to have the

21

undesirable assignments.

22

MS. SEDEY:

Would she have a claim?

I believe she would, because I believe

23

that that's a decision about assigning work, which is a

24

personnel decision.

25

coming before her for a decision of a case tried to attack that

QUESTION;

3

Supposing in a multi-judge appellate

4

court, one of the judges didn't like his opinion assignments,

5

and he claimed that the chief judge was just assigning him

6

because he didn't like his religion or his race or his sex.

7

Would he -have a claim?

8

MS. SEDEY:

9

In theory, I believe that that judge

would have a claim, because again, with regard to that judge's

10

work assignment, it is essentially a personnel decision, an

11

administrative decision of the chief judge to assign certain

12

work to that individual.
On the other hand, if an attorney who was going to

13
14

appear before the court wanted to attack that decision, I

15

believe that that would not lie because again —

here, Mr. Justice.

I understand that.
— viz a viz the litigant, it's an act of

So I think that's the important distinction

Essentially, personnel decisions are administrative

20
21

acts.

There are many acts that a judge takes, any judge at any

22

level, which are official acts, acts assigned to the judge as a

23

part of his or her official functions, acts that perhaps are in

24

fact authorized by statute, but as this Court has ruled in Ex

25

Parte Virginia and Consumers Union, the fact that an act is an

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

10
1

official act of the judge, the fact that an act is carried out

2

pursuant to statutory authority does not make it a judicial act

3

for purposes of judicial immunity.
Our position that it is only acts of adjudication

4
5

which are protected by judicial immunity also derives

6

additional support from the Doctrine's historical development.

7

The earliest cases —
QUESTION:

8
9
10

Well, let me interrupt you for just a

minute, Ms. Sedey, if .1 may, to follow up on some of the
earlier questions.

11

Supposing that a judge is conducting a proceeding in

12

Court, and he has a clerk sitting there, a clerk of the court,

13

who he thinks is unduly loquacious, talking with people coming

14

in.

15

know, when a man sits here on alternate days to me, you let him

16

talk that way.

17

He says, you do it again, I'm going to hold you in contempt.

18

And so she does it again, he holds her in contempt.

19

And so he tells her not to do that, and she says, you

I think you're just discriminating against me.

Now, is he immune from that?

I mean, that's closer,

20

much closer to being a judicial thing, I think, than the

21

examples previously given.

22

MS. SEDEY:

I think it is because it arises .in

23

connection with the judge carrying out his judicial function,

24

the function of adjudication, which is a different matter I

25

think than the matter of an employment decision to hire, fire,

11

demote, whatever, which I believe is a different kind of an

2

act.
QUESTION:

3

Of course, your argument is still the

4

same.

5

similarly situated deputy clerks of the court.

6

You're discriminating on the basis of sex between two

MS. SEDEY:

Well, for instance, I don't think that a

7

litigant who felt that a judge was discriminating between two

8

different litigants in similar law suits could bring an action

9

attacking the judge's decision in her case.

10

QUESTION:

11

MS. SEDEY:

12

QUESTION:

No, that's pretty clear.
Right.
Could I ask you, what if the suit were

13

brought against the clerk?

14

or officer, probation officer, suppose the suit is against the

15

probation officer, and the claim is that the probation officer

16

has been misleading the judge because of sexual or racial

17

discrimination?

18

against the probation officer in connection with her work?

19

20

What if this particular law clerk

So what if it's a racial discrimination claim

MS. SEDEY:

Is it by a litigant, somebody who

complains about the kind of advice?

21

QUESTION:

22

MS. SEDEY:

Yes.
Then I believe that the probation officer

23

would have derivative judicial immunity to suit by a litigant

24

who was unhappy about the advice that she was giving the judge

25

in connection with decisions about say probation or sentencing,

that kind of thing.

MS. SEDEY:

5

But the judge doesn't have absolute

That's correct.

The judge would have

absolutely --

6

QUESTION:

7

MS. SEDEY:

Does he have any immunity?
I think he has qualified immunity exactly

8

the same as any other governmental official would have with

9

respect to administrative acts, in other words, qualified good

10

faith immunity similar to that provided to every governmental

11

official.

12

QUESTION:

Ms. Sedey, I'm not sure I understood your

13

response to the Chief Justice's hypothetical.

14

your rigorous adherence to the logic of your position, but ten

15

I didn't really understand that logic in connection with the

16

Chief Justice's question.

17

judicial immunity, absolute judicial immunity if the judge

18

fired a clerk for making noise during the argument of a case?

19

MS. SEDEY:

I was admiring

Yes.

No.

Not if he fired her for making

20

noise during a decision in a case.

21

hypothetical had to do with the issuance of some kind of

22

contempt order in connection with the proceeding, and it seems

23

to me that a contempt order in the context of a hearing is

24

different from the administrative decision to fire that

employee for her conduct or his conduct in the courtroom.

QUESTION:

What's the magic about it, that it is a

3

that it is a contempt order issued in connection with another

4

judicial proceeding?

5

MS. SEDEY:

6

QUESTION:

7

MS. SEDEY:

Exactly, the fact that —

9

than an administrative personnel decision issued in the judge's

capacity as the employer to discharge the employee.

11

QUESTION:

So having held her in contempt, if he

12

should fire this contemptuous clerk, would there be a cause of

13

action for that firing?

14

MS. SEDEY:

15

QUESTION:

16

19

contempt but couldn't fire her?

Yes, I believe there would be.

QUESTION:

What if he fired her and truthfully said

the reason I'm firing you is because I don't retain people whom

Doctrine of Judicial Immunity, so that —
QUESTION:

12
13

No, but here, we're talking about money

damages?

14

MS. SEDEY:

We are, that's correct.

15

Again, I would suggest that the historical

16

underpinnings of this Doctrine provide strong support for our

17

position that suits about employment decisions are not barred

18

by the Doctrine of Judicial Immunity.
QUESTION:

19

20

What would the judge have to do?

File

charges against this person?
MS. SEDEY:

21

No.

The judge could and should discharge

22

that person if the judge has a legitimate nondiscriminatory

23

reason for doing so.

MS. SEDEY:

That's the difference.
That's one of the differences.

other difference is that in that case, the judge's decision was

not based on that individual's sex, race, religion, age,

legitimate non-discriminatory one.
QUESTION:

16

So then you come back that if this were a

No.
But he has a cause of action if he's a

Is that your position?
MS. SEDEY:

No, because a man has a cause of action

for sex discrimination, just like a woman has.

17

QUESTION:

18

MS. SEDEY:

In this case?
In any case, certainly.

And the judge

19

would have a real strong defense in that case, I think, that

20

the decision was a legitimate one based on the employee's

21

behavior, not based on the employee's sex.

22

QUESTION:

Well, if there's qualified immunity in

23

this case which you concede there is to hold the judge liable

24

for damages, it would have to be found that he had to know that

25

he was firing for sex discrimination, because of gender.

3

No.

I think that what qualifies —

Or that he — well, what do you think the

test is for qualified immunity?
MS. SEDEY:

4

I think that the qualified immunity would

5

simply provide him with an opportunity to say that he didn't

6

realize that the conduct that he's charged with violated a

7

statute, and I don't really think it would do him much good.

8

Qualified immunity in a discrimination case is not of much

assistance to a public official.

10

It would be of some assistance to someone

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

You may proceed, Ms.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROSALYN B. KAPLAN, ESQ.

4

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MS. KAPLAN:

5
6
7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court.
The Seventh Circuit properly upheld a grant of

8

judicial immunity in connection with the actions of Judge White

9

in this case.

And I would ask this Court today to recognize

10

that where an employee's tasks are an integral part of the

11

discretionary judicial decision making process acts in regard

12

to personnel decisions regarding this employee ought also to be

13

recognized as judicial acts, and the judge ought to be entitled

14

to immunity for executing such acts.

15

The duties of a probation officer have been well

16

recognized as substantive functions that assist the

17

discretionary decision making process.

18

judge's sentencing decisions, his disposition in juvenile cases

19

are going to reflect the quality, the advice, the

20

recommendations of his probation officer.

21

those decisions is an important consideration and a judge who

22

is concerned about the quality of his decisions has got to make

23

a personnel decision reflecting his concerns for his decision

24

making tasks.

25

QUESTION:

The substance of a

The soundness of

What about a United States attorney who

Heritage

fires an assistant United States attorney on the claimed ground

2

that the person's incompetent, but the individual fired claims

3

that it was because of sex discrimination?

4

MS. KAPLAN:

The immunity that would be addressed

5’

there would likely be an executive type of immunity and the

6

considerations are going to have to be different accordingly.

7

QUESTION:

Why?

Why?

I don't see why.

I mean, you

have the same function.

9

respect to his prosecutory decisions that are related to the

judicial function.

11

MS. KAPLAN:

To the extent that Your Honor is talking

12

about the quasi judicial immunity that's extended to a

13

prosecutor in connection with prosecutorial decisions and he

14

has to address a situation where his employee is assisting him

15

in making discretionary decisions, I would agree that the same

16

analysis would apply.

17

I'm sorry if I misunderstood Your Honor.

18

The point I'm making here is that when an employee

19

involved

20

process for which immunity applies, the personnel decisions

21

regarding that employee should equally be recognized as

22

judicial acts and entitled to the same sort of immunity.

23

in a task that is an integral part of a judicial

QUESTION:

So assistant U.S. attorneys can be fired

I don't know what you mean by, to the

extent that.

That's what they do.

5

therefore, if one is fired for incompetence, allegedly for

6

incompetence, no suit would lie for sex discrimination?

7
8

They are.

I mean, they all are, aren't they?

They prosecute cases, right?

MS. KAPLAN:

Yes.

So

The same reasoning would apply,

Your Honor.

This Court has recognized that for a member of

Congress, for example, that member of Congress cannot execute

will find other relief than to require that an individual work

Nothing could be done about it as I understand you.

14

MS. KAPLAN:

And they fire all except the ten

No, Your Honor, I'm sorry.

That's not

15

what I mean.

for one prosecutor, I believe that equitable relief would lie.

20

In the situation of a staff of attorneys working

QUESTION:

Well, why wouldn't it lie here?

That's

what I don't understand.
MS. KAPLAN:

I'd like to distinguish that on the

21

basis of the close and personal relationship in a very small

22

office in a county court where there is a judge working closely

23

with one probation officer and all of those functions are

24

performed together.

25

equitable relief would have to take that into consideration.

I think it's a difference in degree and

QUESTION:

So if it was Cook County instead of where

then you could grant equitable relief?
MS. KAPLAN:

would lie.

I think that perhaps equitable relief

There's a different procedure involved.
QUESTION:

If that's true, how does that really solve

7

the problem that the Immunity Doctrine's supposed to solve in

8

part of avoiding a lot of law suits and not tying up the

9

judge's time.

Because if you just say to this person who's

10

been improperly or allegedly improperly discharged, you can't

11

sue for damages, I would assume they'd come in and sue and ask

12

to get their jobs back.

13

MS. KAPLAN:

I think that's a possibility.

I think

14

that's a possibility that this Court allowed to exist through

15

its decision in Pulliam v. Allen, and that there are still

16

other interests inherent in the Doctrine o£ Judicial Immunity

17

and one of those is the potential liability of a judge for an

18

action in damages.

19

The state of the law on judicial immunity as it

20

exists now is that an action for injunctive relief will lie.

21

That has to be acknowledged.

22

still important considerations under the function of judicial

23

immunity and that a judge ought to be able to take those into

24

account and not be risking his personal action for damages and

25

to cut back on some of the time that he must spend involved in

Heritage

Nonetheless, I think there are

litigation in order to fulfill his decision making process.

2

Certainly, his fears of retaliation are realistic

3

fears.

4

that actions for discrimination had geometrically increased

5

since the enactment of Section 1988.

6

rights employment litigation increased in the Federal District

7

Courts by 14 percent, and this was at a time when other civil

8

actions, the filing of other civil cases had decreased for the

9

first time since I believe 1977.

10

In Pulliam v. Allen, the dissent of this Court noted

The fear is there.

Last year alone, civil

It's a realistic fear perhaps a

11

judge that knows more about the process than anyone is going to

12

be more concerned than anyone of risking this kind of

13

litigation.

14

with a decision of retaining a probation officer in whom he

15

lacks confidence, should he have to weigh in the balance the

16

threat of litigation by that particular individual?

17

So the question becomes, when a judge is faced

There's always a balance involved in any case of

18

judicial immunity.

19

believe the balance in a particular situation where an employee

20

is part of the substantive decision making process that a

21

favorable decision for judicial immunity will further the

22

judicial process.

23

And the balance has to be addressed.

Certainly the judge may be disciplined.

And I

Certainly

24

the judge may be subject to an action for criminal violations

25

of the Federal law.

But I ask this Court to conclude that the

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

26
1

balance is in favor of a finding of immunity for this kind of

2

personnel action by a -judge.
Not only is immunity proper as a matter of policy,

3
4

but I believe it is consistent with the precedent of this

5

Court.

6

that judicial immunity shields a judge from liability for

7

damages for his judicial acts taken within the general scope of

8

his jurisdiction.

9

Certainly as a general proposition, it's recognized

QUESTION:

May I ask, because as I understood — the

10

Seventh Circuit opinions a little hard for me to know just

11

where they draw the line between this kind of immunity.

12
13
14

Do you think it applies, for example, to secretaries,
law clerks, other employees in an office?
MS. KAPLAN:

I think that the Seventh Circuit's

15

opinion would apply very likely to an individual like a law

16

clerk, and perhaps to a staff attorney in certain courts.

17

would not I believe apply to a secretary, and that five days

18

after the Court entered this opinion in Forrester v. White, it

19

entered an opinion in

20

a Judge had

fired his court reporter, and the Court did not

21

disavow its

reasoning in Forrester v. White, but it explained

22

that in the

case of a court reporter, the individual employee

23

did not assist the judge in his decision making functions, and

24

because of that distinction, the relationship was more that of

25

an employee and an employer, rather than a judge and an

As a matter of fact, the McMillan rationale was later

applied by the Sixth Circuit in Guercio v. Brody, and in that

case, a federal bankruptcy judge was held not immune from an

action for damages for firing his personal secretary.

628-4888

32

this Court today is reasoning that can be found in the

decisions of those Courts, and I think it's very persuasive

3

reasoning.

4

In Aqromayer v. Colberq, the First Circuit considered

5

a situation where an individual had applied for a position as a

press officer with the Puerto Rican House of Representatives.

7

The District Court, in that case, in evaluating the claim of

8

the individual who was refused the position, did apply the kind

9

of bright line test that is being urged by the petitioner

10

today.

And it said, well, hiring or firing, that's

11

administrative, there's no immunity.
But the Court of Appeals examined the situation and

12
13

felt that that kind of evaluation was too narrow, because to

14

the extent that a particular employee was considered essential

15

to the legislative process, then his qualifications and his

selection ought also to be considered essential to the

In Ex Parte Virginia, the Court ruled on

two alternative bases, and this Court has since recognized that

it did not hold necessarily that a ministerial act was

nonetheless, the judge in question could be held liable under

Again, the Ex Parte Virginia case was not a case involving a

You think it makes any difference that in

MS. KAPLAN:

No, Your Honor, I do not.

That the judicial function is much more likely

Another reason is the exercise of

decision that I believe applies in this case as well as to a

decisions based upon judicial immunity were not issued because

24

a judge had been sued by a disappointed litigant.

25

were issued where a judge had disbarred an attorney, stricken

Heritage

It's that kind of policy

Rather, they

2

It's a different kind of situation, and I suggest

3

that the rationale there, although the Court did discuss the

4

cases of disappointed litigants, the true rationale is the

5

protection of the judicial process by enabling a court to have

6

this authority over the appointment and the removal of these

7

officers of the court.
A probation officer is also an officer of the court.

8
9

And I think that the decisions made with regard to the

10

probation officer ought also to be recognized as judicial

11

decisions.

12

Your Honors, in these days where judicial case loads

13

are increasing and a judge must increasingly rely on the

14

substantive aid of his assistants, such as a probation officer,

15

I believe that a judge is entitled to absolute judicial

16

immunity for his acts, and I would ask this Court to affirm the

17

judgment of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.

did not intend to abrogate the common law doctrine of judicial

immunity as it existed at the time the statute was passed.

has certainly found in the interim that 1983 can be used

QUESTION:

Just out of curiosity, does Illinois

provide indemnification for any of its other public officials,
