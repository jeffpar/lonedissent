Mr. Schwartz, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HERMAN SCHWARTZ, ESQUIRE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. SCHWARTZ:

9
10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court.
This is an appeal by the New Energy Company of

12

Indiana, an Indiana ethanol producer, from the fourth

13

redecision of the Ohio Supreme Court on rehearing that rejected

14

New Energy's Commerce Clause challenge to a 1984 amendment to

15

Ohio's sales tax credit for the gasoline ethanol blend or 90\10

16

blend known as gasohol.

17

Prior to 1985, Ohio had granted a credit to the motor

18

vehicle fuel tax for gasoline for gasohol.

19

1984, it amended the statute by denying the credit to gasohol

20

containing ethanol produced in another state unless that

21

foreign producer state grants a credit to ethanol sold there

22

containing Ohio produced ethanol.

23

is limited the amount of credit granted Ohio ethanol in that

24

other state.

25

On December 20,

The credit that Ohio grants

Now, although the Ohio courts agreed that the

Heritage

3
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

reciprocity provision effectively excluded New Energy from the

2

Ohio ethanol market, they nevertheless upheld it.

3

is that this 1984 amendment which was conceded by the Supreme

4

Court of Ohio to be a forced reciprocity statute discriminating

5

against out-of-state products by denying the tax credit unless

6

the out-of-state product's home state provides a similar tax

7

credit, must pass a strict scrutiny test, and that this clearly

8

does not.

9

QUESTION:

Our position

Mr. Schwartz, what if all we had in front

10

of us was an Ohio statute that granted a tax credit to

11

producers of ethanol in Ohio, no reciprocity provision.

12

you be here, and would you think that posed a commerce clause

13

problem?

14
15

MR. SCHWARTZ:

QUESTION:

Do you think that would be true if Ohio

had a serious concern about its citizens' health problems?

18

MR. SCHWARTZ:

19

QUESTION:

20

Yes, Your Honor, if it grants a tax

credit only to Ohio ethanol, yes, Your Honor.

16
17

Would

Yes.

Do you think it couldn't provide a tax

credit to encourage the production and use of ethanol in Ohio?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

21

Yes.

But that is the kind, of

22

protection that must meet the strictest of all scrutiny.

It's

23

almost per se illegal, that kind of tax credit, as this Court

24

has found.

QUESTION:

1

Well, let me ask you this.

Do you think

2

that Ohio could, instead of a tax credit, give some kind of

3

bonus payment to producers of ethanol in Ohio?

4

MR. SCHWARTZ:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. SCHWARTZ:

7

QUESTION:

8

Yes.

And States have done that.

It could do that?
Yes.

And States have done that.

You don't think that a tax credit is

essentially the same thing as a bonus?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

9

No, it's not, Your Honor.

credit is aimed in the form in which you've raised it, it is

aimed almost explicitly at out of state producers.

15

It says,

It's a discriminatory tax on its

It is the kind of tax that I think it's fair to say the

QUESTION:

Well, I guess it's a little hard though to

16

distinguish between an outright grant of state money and an

17

extension of a tax credit?

18

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Right.

It is, Your Honor, but that

19

kind of distinction is a distinction that this Court has always

20

made, and frequently made, because ultimately almost everything

21

that a State does when it spends money, whether it spends money

22

on research, whether it spends money to facilitate matters in

23

one way or another for its products, is an expenditure of money

24

on behalf of its own.

25

For example, in the Hunt case, the Court pointed out

5

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

and I think that was unanimous

that the State of

2

Washington had spent a great deal of money to develop a grading

3

system for Washington apples.

4

match that by taking away that advantage that the State of

5

Washington had created, this Court unanimously said, you can't

6

do that.

7

And when North Carolina tried to

It's okay to spend money.
But when you discriminate, when you set up a tax

8

system and it is discriminatory taxes that the Commerce Clause

9

is historically aimed at, when you set, and which this Court

10

11

has again and again struck down -QUESTION:

So you would just distinguish the

12

Alexandria Scrap type situation based on the fact that this is

13

within the tax structure?

14

MR. SCHWARTZ:

That's right.

And the Court did so

15

itself, Your Honor.

16

subsequent to Alexandria Scrap, Reeves, the others,

17

particularly in Justice Blackmun's discussion in Reeves of the

18

market participant doctrine, the Court said, the Commerce

19

Clause is aimed at regulation and direct taxes.

20

aimed at the situation where a state enters the market.

21

not aimed at the situation where perhaps the State even spends

22

its own money.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

In Alexandria Scrap and in the cases

It is not
It is

Mr. Schwartz, I'm not sure you'd really

hold to that line.
In the subsidy situation you were just addressing,

6

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

•

1

it's assumed that the subsidy goes to the producer, no matter

2

where the producer sells it.

3

that applied to an in-state producer but only if he sells those

4

products within the state, and he forgoes that subsidy to the

5

extent he ships out of the state, would you say, well, that's

6

not a tax so it's all right?

7

MR. SCHWARTZ:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. SCHWARTZ:

10

•

Yes, Your Honor, I would say that.

You would.
Because it is not a tax.

I think --

As long as it's not a tax, you can do

11

whatever you like to --

12

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, you can spend your money in any

13

way you want so long as you're not taxing.

14
15

on anything you want in your own state.

16

only if he ships nothing out of state and as soon as he ships

17

out of state, he looses the subsidy and that doesn't interfere

18

with the Commerce Clause?

19

QUESTION:

You can spend money

So I can subsidize an in-state produce but

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, I think that's right because I

20

think at that point, it comes close to the market participant

21

doctrine although there is a danger that that doctrine could

22

swallow up the entire situation.

23

QUESTION:

Suppose you had a state subsidy

The point is lost in my version and

It seems to me that this is precisely what we're
dealing with here.

many possibilities of discrimination built into it, and it's

historically so dangerous because the alternative, Justice

said, you just can't do that.

by a discriminatory tax.

7
8

You can't help your own industry

Now, if I may take a minute to sort of recollect
where I was in my argument.

9

Now, to go back, some ethanol was sold in Ohio in

10

1979 and 1980, but in 1981, the same year New Energy's Ohio

11

competitor, Southpoint Ethanol, which is an intervenor in this

12

case, was formed, Ohio adopted a sales tax credit for all

13

ethanol sold in Ohio.

14

gasohol, which ultimately fell to 2.5 cents.

15

It was about 3.5 cents a gallon of

Indiana had a comparable fuel tax credit which it

16

repealed in early '84, effective July,

'85, and it authorized

17

at that time a production subsidy which in fact was dropped a

18

year later again on July '86.
In the fall of 1984, New Energy went into production

19
20

in Indiana.

And Southpoint's sales in Indiana began to fall

21

sharply.

On December 20th, the Ohio reciprocity provision was

22

enacted.

As the Trial Court found, Southpoint had lobbied the

23

Ohio legislature for this provision, in fact, stressing to the

24

legislature -- and the word stressing was used twice by the

25

Southpoint witness -- how important Southpoint was to the most

Heritage

9
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

depressed areas of the Ohio economy.

2

This reciprocity provision which also, by the way,

3

excluded ethanol from almost all gas-fired plants and ethanol

4

made from cane and beet sugar, this was done in order to

5

pressure Indiana to restore the Indiana tax credit, and in fact

6

it was aimed only at Indiana, for every other state that could

7

be affected by this tax credit, the producers in other states

8

like Tennessee, Illinois and elsewhere already had a credit

9

which they were giving.
Now, loss of the Ohio tax credit, when all of the New

10
11

Energy's competitors continued to get this credit inevitably

12

excluded New Energy from the Ohio market, as the Trial Court

13

found.

14

Court found two, and only two legislative purposes.

15

like to quote that, if I may.

17

When New Energy challenged this .Statute, the Trial

"To promote domestic industry and to affect the
policies of other states."

18

The Court nevertheless upheld the statute because --

19

QUESTION:

20
21

22

May I stop you on that point just for a

moment.
The Court did also adopt appellees' additional
finding of purpose.

23

MR. SCHWARTZ:

24

QUESTION:

25

Right, Your Honor.

And it isn't altogether clear to me

whether or not there was an additional purpose to provide a

10

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

1
2

3
4

cleaner and. safer environment for Ohio citizens.
MR. SCHWARTZ: Your Honor, that's a troubling point.
I had a lot of trouble understanding that finding.
The first sentence says, it is conceivable that there

5

were other purposes.

6

modifies everything which is actually all there is, then it

7

seems to me there is no such finding.

8

looks at the intermediate appellate court's opinion, which

9

lists the purposes, it does not include that.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

One of these was -- now if conceivable

And indeed when one

If it was a purpose of the legislature,

how does that affect the legal analysis?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Not at all, Your Honor, because if it

13

were, there would still be a least drastic alternative test.

14

After all, in Dean Milk and many other cases, the Court said,

15

and in Hunt,

17

18

Indeed, it's counterproductive to that

11
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

of

gasoline, not to gasohol, in which case the amount of pollution

2

in the air would multiply rather than be reduced.
Now, despite these findings which, again with the

3
4

ambiguity that you've pointed to, the Court nevertheless upheld

5

the statute because New Energy was the only producer affected

6

and would not have been affected had Indiana not repealed the

7

tax credit.
QUESTION:

8
9

Do we have cases which say that it's

improper to try to influence the policies of other states'?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

10

Yes, there are, but of course, it

11

depends on the method of influence.

12

inherently in trying to influence the policies of other states.

13

It depends on how you do it.

16

influence other states, but you can't do it by discriminating

17

in taxes.

18

There is nothing wrong

Indeed, even under the equal

So that it seems to me the answer is in itself

19

neutrally there's no problem about trying to influence.

20

example, you try to influence by improving the economic climate

22

may tty to respond in other ways.

dealing with that very serious health problem, the answer would
be, yes.
QUESTION:

11

13

situation?

14
15

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, I'm not quite sure by, this

situation, but the cases I rely on are Dean Milk.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Did that use the term, least drastic?
Yes.

Yes, it did, Your Honor.

18

quite sure that it did use the term.

19

did as well.

20

QUESTION:

I'm

And I think the ASP case

I thought Dean used the reasonable

21

alternative analysis, it said whether there's a reasonable

22

alternative.

23

MR. SCHWARTZ:

I don't think so, Your Honor, because

24

I think as I recall Justice Black was unhappy because it was

25

using First Amendment doctrine, and I think he commented on

Heritage

13
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

2

that.

I'm not sure.
I think the phrase in A&P there's one reference here

3

to less drastic alternative, and there are I think other ways

4

in which the Court stressed that you've got to look at other

5

alternatives that create less problems.

6

Indeed, the Pike v.

Bruce Church test itself says

7

that even when something regulates evenhandedly, which I think

8

this does not, even when something regulates evenhandedly under

9

those circumstances, and for a legitimate purpose, you still

10

have to look to see where there are other ways that could

11

accomplish the same thing.

12
13

QUESTION:

But, Mr. Schwartz, it's one thing to say

you have to look at other alternatives.

14

MR. SCHWARTZ:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

Right.

It's quite another thing to say you must

employ the least drastic of these alternatives.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, Your Honor, even if it's not

18

least drastic, the Court certainly has insisted on less

19

burdensome, and there are less burdensome.

20

statute, the initial tax credit in Ohio in 1981 which allowed

21

the credit for ethanol,

22

itself was quite an adequate alternative without the

23

reciprocity.

24
25

Indeed, the initial

just like that, ethanol or methanol

We are not challenging the tax credit which was made
available in '81 to everyone.

Heritage

We're challenging the

14
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

reciprocity and we're saying that the tax credit without the

2

reciprocity which now some eleven states have and which in 1985

3

approximately 23 states had, that that is a less burdensome

4

alternative which accomplishes the same purpose.
After all, over the years, the rate of usage of

5
6

ethanol, of gasohol, I think, has risen from something like 400

7

or 500 million gallons to 900 million gallons during this

8

period without, with very few of these reciprocity statutes

9

operating.
Now, if I may return, our argument, which is of

10
11

course what we've been talking about here is that reciprocity

12

statutes face strict scrutiny and for a very good reason.

13

involve facial discrimination, they create most favored nation

14

enclaves, precisely the kind of preferential trade areas that

15

the Commerce Clause is supposed to prevent, and they threaten

16

economic isolation in an effort to control the policies of

17

other states.

18

They

All of those I think have been touched on by this

19

Court.

20

strict scrutiny, but they ruled that because others from

21

outside Ohio, besides New Energy, could come into Ohio, there

Now, the Ohio courts recognized the applicability of

6

Louisiana did not.

And the Court still struck

There is no requirement either that there be an

9

bar, and in fact in this case as the Trial Court recognized, it

11

I think this Court has recognized right from the

had precisely that effect.

New Energy was excluded.

The fact is with the competitors getting the credit,

12

there was no way New Energy could compete in the Ohio market.

13

Now, with respect to the health claim, I think I've

14

already touched on that, unless there are some further

15

questions on it.

16

And indeed, there's some question as to whether any

17

credit is necessary for health, because over the years, there

18

has been a decline in the use of any tax credits and an

19

enormous increase in the use of ethanol.

20

before, it's very possible that New Energy's loss in Indiana

21

may have been diverted not to another ethanol producer, but to

22

gasoline, which in turn would produce increased pollution.

23

And as I pointed out

And I think the record quite beyond dispute shows

24

that the purpose here was to pressure Indiana to restore that

25

tax credit for the benefit of the Ohio competitor, an important

2

used a great deal of Ohio corn and coal.

was stressed at the legislative hearing.

And as I said, this

4

Now, an argument has been made --

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Schwartz, before you go on to the new

6

argument, will you tell me why this is different from what we

7

have clearly allowed that is facially discriminatory and that

8

is the assessment by a state of a compensating use tax.

9

In that situation, the state is just equilibrating

10

matters between itself and other states.

11

sellers will be at a disadvantage because of its tax if other

12

states don't impose taxes so it imposes a use tax on any

13

imports.

thing.

15

abroad, viz a viz, the sellers in the state that does not give

16

the same credit that it does.

17

It's worried that its

It seems to me the state here is doing the same
It's worried that its sellers will be at a disadvantage

MR. SCHWARTZ:

So it's just making things even.

Your Honor, I think the difference is,

18

and the case you're talking about is obviously Henneford v.

19

Silas Mason, that line of case.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. SCHWARTZ:

22
23

Right.

And they're tax cases.

Right.

Oh, yes, they're clearly tax

cases.
The difference is that that's a situation in which a

24

subsidies and market participant.
The market participant is a narrow doctrine designed

2
3

to deal with that situation whereas the Court has said, and I

4

think the most detailed statement is in Reeves and I think

5

other Justices have quoted that Reeves statement, where the

6

State acts as the equivalent of a private business, where it is

7

buying or it is selling or it is manufacturing.
QUESTION:

8
9

Well, that doesn't explain Alexandria

Scrap, I don't think.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

10

It doesn't explain it fully except

11

Justice Powell referred to the case as, I think the Reeves case

12

as a situation in which the State was really acting as a

13

purchaser.

14

What happened in Alexandria Scrap, of course, --

15

QUESTION:

Well, I don't think so.

The situation

16

appears at least to be one where the state wanted to encourage

17

disposal of the old auto hulks, just like Ohio might want to

18

encourage the use of ethanol.

19

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Yes.

But the Court, I think, has

20

characterized it, and indeed in the subsequent cases certainly

21

treated both Alexandria Scrap and the line of cases as a line

22

of cases where the state acts as a private trader.

23

justification I think that was given in Reeves v. Stake is that

24

it acts as a private trader and may indeed even be subject to

25

the constraints of a private trader, which a plurality of the

Indeed, the

1

Court then applied subsequently in the South Central Timber

2

case, imposing restraints on an alienation and in effect

3

preventing an effort to control a downstream operation, namely,

4

processing of timber.
And unless I think the rule is cabined and limited

5

6

that way, it could easily swallow up the entire Commerce

7

Clause, because again almost any tax credit can be called a tax

8

expenditure.

And indeed an expenditure.

And at that point,

the Court would have to reexamine and in effect overrule this
10

lengthy line of cases which go as recently as last year.
I think I will sit down now and reserve the rest of

11
12

my time for rebuttal.

And simply conclude by saying that this

13

Statute is clearly unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause

14

and the decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio on rehearing the

15

second Ohio Supreme Court decision should be overruled and

16

reversed.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

18

Mr. Farrin, we'll hear now from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD C. FARRIN, ESQUIRE

20

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. FARRIN:

21

22
23

Thank you, Mr. Schwartz.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court.
The issues in this case are twofold.

The first issue

24

to be decided is whether the Ohio tax credit scheme is the type

25

of state action that is subject to the restraints of the

Heritage

20
Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1

Commerce Clause.

Within this one issue there are actually two

2

questions to be considered by the Court.
Initially as this Court has heard during the initial

3
4

argument in this case, whether or not the market participant

5

principle applies to the ethanol tax credit scheme.
The second issue, which is also a matter that was

6

7

touched upon by this Court in the Alexandria Scrap case but not

8

decided, is whether the Commerce Clause prohibits state action

9

effecting a flow of commerce that is dependent for its

10

existence upon a state subsidy rather than on the private

11

market.

12

The second issue is whether assuming this scheme is

13

subject to the Commerce Clause restrictions, whether it is

14

valid under the various tests established by this Court.

15

As New Energy's counsel has pointed out, the Ohio

16

General Assembly initially enacted its tax credit provision in

17

1981 to provide an encouragement for the use of ethanol as a

18

substitute for lead in gasoline.

19

be to protect the environment of Ohio because as has been

20

stipulated throughout these proceedings, ethanol is the most

21

environmentally benign substitute for lead in gasoline.

22

The result of this use would

Other benefits of the use of ethanol are the creation

23

of an alternative market for corn and a reduction of the

24

country's dependency on foreign oil,

25

these purposes are legitimate purposes for the State to pursue.

It's undisputed that

21

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

The portion of the scheme that is the subject of the

1

2

challenge before this Court is the enactment in 1984 which

3

became effective in 1985 of the reciprocity provision that

4

limited the credit given to motor vehicle fuel dealers to the

5

use of ethanol that was produced either in Ohio or in any other

6

state that granted similar credits for the use of ethanol to

7

Ohio dealers to Ohio produced ethanol.
This scheme, including the reciprocity scheme, does

8

9

not put any prohibition on the sale or distribution of ethanol

10

in Ohio, nor does it regulate the conditions under which the

11

flow of ethanol may occur in Ohio.

13

the price of ethanol.

21

in the marketplace.

22

with ethanol, absent both Federal and state subsidies, ethanol

23

simply could not compete in the free private marketplace with

24

gasoline.

25

Its purpose at that point in time was the same, to bid

Because of the production costs involved

And the evidence in the record affirms that fact.
QUESTION:

Mr. Farrin, do you really think it solves

22

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

matters to simply say it's the application of a state subsidy?

2

I assume, for example, that a state could if it chooses

3

subsidize all of its domestic industries in a lot of ways, by

4

tax credits, or even by giving them money.

5

state could subsidize domestic production by only charging a

6

sales tax on out-of-state products and not charging a sales tax

7

on in-state products.

8

because all we're doing is subsidizing in-state industry which

9

is certainly a laudable and valid goal?
MR. FARRIN:

10

But do you think a

And saying, well, that's all fine

Justice Scalia, initially I think from

11

an economic standpoint, that's a very unlikely event.

12

Secondly, I don't think this case requires the Court to so

13

hold.

14

QUESTION:

15

I asked whether you thought that would be

16

constitutional simply because it's the application of a state

17

subsidy?

18

MR. FARRIN:

I didn't ask either of those questions.

I do not think it would be to simply use

19

a tax exemption to favor local business with no other purpose,

20

I do not believe would be constitutional, Justice Scalia.

21

22
23

QUESTION:

So subsidy isn't the answer.

I mean, it

doesn't necessarily prove that this is okay.
MR. FARRIN:

Your Honor, I submit under Alexandria

Scrap that a direct subsidy may in fact be unlimited.

that case leaves the future unclear as to how it will be

I submit though that at the least, Alexandria Scrap

would allow a state to subsidize a local industry if it was

part of a scheme that was effected to carry out a legitimate

state purpose other than simply protectionism.

13

have other benefits including the increased market for corn and

legitimate state purpose.

Justice Scalia, I'm not an expert on

25

additional reason for encouraging the use of ethanol, because

29

Heritage

1

clearly the more ethanol that is used, the more corn, which is

2

a primary raw material, is used.
I would point out that there is no restriction

whatsoever in the Ohio statutory scheme that limits the source

of the corn used to make ethanol.

course.

And in fact, the record

There is a national market in corn, of

You can take it from anywhere and the national

market's going to help your domestic corn.
MR. FARRIN:

11

That's correct, Justice Scalia.

And I

12

suggest the same reasons point to the necessity for having a

13

national market in ethanol.

It's simply a matter of things

14

such as economies of scale.

If a producer is going to be

15

limited to the market it can distribute its product, it's

16

simply not going to get to the level where it can compete with

17

the major gas producers of the country.

18

The Ohio scheme has not caused any impact on the flow

19

of ethanol from Indiana due to any prohibition or to any

20

regulation on the way or method by which it can come into Ohio.

21

The impact on the flow if any ethanol from New Energy is due to

22

Ohio making it more lucrative for Ohio motor vehicle fuelers to

23

use that fuel because they get a credit if they use fuel that's

produced in Ohio or in any other state that grants a similar

To me that suggests that what the Court is thinking
is that if you're dealing with a legitimate state purpose in

MR. FARRIN:

Justice Stevens, if in Dean Milk, the

15

reciprocity provisions themselves were not the subject of a per

se rule of invalidity, it was the effect of those reciprocity

commerce.

In Great A&P Tea Company and in Sporhase, the

Court also recognized that the purported purpose by the State

MR. FARRIN:

6

The second issue that was discussed in

7

the Alexandria case, but was not decided because the majority

8

of the Court felt there was not an adequate record upon which

9

to determine it, was whether or not the Commerce Clause forbids

20

state action affecting a flow of commerce that is dependent for

2

its existence on state subsidies rather than on private market

22

forces.

23

The majority noted in a footnote that if the facts

24

had so shown, it would have hesitated to find that the Commerce

25

Clause did in fact prohibit such action.

Justice Stevens indicated that that Justice felt that the

Commerce Clause did not prohibit such state action.
I think the reasoning in both that footnote and in

3

Justice Stevens' concurring opinion supports that thought.

5

Commerce Clause only prohibits state action which affects the

6

operation of a free market or a natural functioning of the

7

private marketplace.

9

such a flow involve the Commerce Clause?

If there is no naturally functioning

interfere with a subject that the Commerce Clause was intended

to cover.

12

While the record in Alexandria Scrap might not have

13

been sufficient for the Court to determine that issue, the

14

record in this case is replete with evidence that the ethanol

15

market would not exist at its present level or at any

16

significant level in Ohio, absent the state credit that's

17

granted by this scheme.

that particular phrase of less drastic alternative.
