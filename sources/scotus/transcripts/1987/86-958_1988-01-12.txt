In doing so, the Count of Appeals reversed the
factual findings of both the Bankruptcy Court and the District
Court, regarding the lack of adequate protection for the
secured creditors’

interest in the property, and also regarding

the feasibility of reorganization

of this particular debtor.

The panel decision held that a Chapter 11
reorganization of this debtor in this case would be feasible,
notwithstanding the opposite finding by the District Court.
In this case, the Court of Appeals held that
reorganization would be feasible because number one, the debtor
in this case would have no present obligation to provide
adequate protection of his secured creditors’

interests in

collateral, thereby freeing up funds for reorganisation that
would otherwise need to be used to pay adequate protection, and
number two, that reorganization would be feasible because the
debtor could overcome what is known as the "absolute priority"
rule of 11 U.S.C. Section 11£9(B), previously reflected in this
Court’s decisions in Case v. Los Angeles Lumber, and others,
that the "absolute priority" rule could be overcome by the
debtor’s promising in the plan to devote his future labor,
experience and expertise to the reorganized operation.
The essence of it is that, notwithstanding the
statute, and the prior decisions of this Court, a bankruptcy
debtor under this decision may retain property by a future
promise of working without paying his creditors.

The case arises out of the following general facts;

1
c.

The Petitioners are creditors of the debtor who in this case is
a farmer.

4
5

The Petitioners include the Federal Land Bank, of St.

Paul and Norwest Bank of Worthington.
The Land Bank’s interest began in about 1965 when it

6

made various real estate loans to Mr.

7

of Norwest Bank. Worthington arose in about 198£ when that bank,

8

extended various operating loans,

9

mortgages on real estate,

1
1 1

flhlers,

all secured by second

and by security interests in other-

col lateral.
The debtors’

borrowings from these two institutions

1£

amounted to in the neighborhood of $1 million.

13

the debtors’

14

filed for protection,

15

and the interests

By late 1984,

were in serious default under their loans and
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.

Shortly following that filing the Land Bank and

16

Norwest promptly moved for relief from the bankruptcy automatic

17

stay under Section 36£(D> of the Bankruptcy Code to permit

18

foreclose of their mortgages and security interests.

19

fit this time,

I think it is common knowledge,

particularly in the Midwest,

the

£

farm economy,

was in a troubled

£1

state and secured creditors in particular were seeing the

C.C.

values of their collateral diminish.

Land values in particular

had declined sharply and were continuing on the downside.
£4
£5

Indications,

Justice White,

are that the corner may

Heritage

<£ £> 6£8-4S88

QUESTION!

I’m glad to know that.

MR.

There may be some dispute about that.

CONN:

In seeking relief from the stay to permit
foreclosure,

the two creditors here moved both to lift the stay

for lack, of adequate protection of their interests in the
collateral under Section 362(d)(1),
from stay under Section 36£(d)(£),

and also moved for relief
which provides for relief

from stay where the debtor has no equity in the property,

and

the property in question is not necessary for an effective
reorganization.
In moving under this latter section,

the Petitioners

took the position that the property was not necessary for an
effective reorganization,

because the debtors’

financial

condition was so desperate that no reorganization could in any
instance be feasible in this case.
The Bankruptcy Court granted relief from the stay,
holding that adequate protection was required to protect
Petitioners’

interest in the property and that the debtors’

officers of adequate protection were not sufficient to provide
that protection.
Accordingly,

the Bankruptcy Court ordered that the

automatic stay be lifted to permit the creditors to foreclose
their interest.
The District Court affirmed and the debtor then
sought relief in the Court of Appeals to stay the effect of the

Herit age

Report ing Corporation
<£0£) 6£8-4888

7
1

orders of the lower Court.
The Court of Appeals did stay the orders, pending

CL

appeal, and also directed,

in connection with one of those

4

interim orders, that the District Court undertake a specific

5

examination of the feasibility of reorganisation for these?

6

debtors.
The District Court did so, and in an Opinion included

7

8

in our Appendix, the District Court undertook an analysis of

9

the debtors’ financial operations and projections from the

10

Bankruptcy Court file and concluded that the debtors’ situation

1 1

was so dire that there was utter unfeasibility of

IS

reorganization.
The matter then went back, to the Eighth Circuit, and

13
14

on that further appeal,

15

of Appeals reversed the lower Court’s holding that no adequate

16

protection was required as to the real estate because of a

17

timing issue that would hold under the applicable state law

18

that no protection would be required for a year and six weeks,

19

thereby freeing up substantial funds for use by the debtor

£0

while retaining the property, and number two, and this is the?

QUESTION:

Mr. Conn, can I ask you one question

before you get into the main part of your argument?
Your clients are partially secured creditors and they

are also partially general creditors, because they are

undersecured,

is the way it works out.

6

MR. CONN:

That is correct.

7

QUESTION:

general creditors who had no secured interest at all.
Was there a creditors’ committee or something?
they have a position in the litigation, the creditors?
MR. CONN:

Did

I am not specifically sure, Justice

Stevens. The amount of unsecured creditors who were not in this

3

dual position, as are the two banks, was very, very small.

believe the total indebtedness reflected there was something

like $70,000 as compared to $500,000 in the unsecured portion

of the Petitioners.

To my knowledge, those other creditors have been
inactive throughout the proceedings.

9

QUESTION:

Thank you.

£0

MR. CONN:

We believe that the decision of the Eighth

SI

Circuit Panel is error,

basically for three reasons.

First, allowing the retention of property by a debtor
izlvi

without satisfying objecting creditors in full is contrary to

£4

the plain language of the relevant portion of the statute.

and in doing so, unfairly expands the so-called cram down power
£

of debtors to the severe detriment of creditors.
On the first point, which I think is the clearest,

that is, the language of the statute.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Conn, you are not arguing, as the

6

Government’s amicus brief does, that even non-sweat equity

cannot be crammed down, are you?

I would have to say that there does not appear at

the part of Congress to in any way expand whatever exception

7

there might have been to absolute? priority under those cases.

8

3

is that there was clearly no intention on

I think the contrary is true, and that can be seen by
the fact that in defining the term "fair and equitable" out of

10

which the absolute priority rule had evolved in judicial

11

decisions, Congress chose expressly to define "fair and

1£

equitable" to exclude the retention of property without full

13

payment of senior creditors.

14

QUESTION:

You say,

in other words, that the

15

Bankruptcy Code went no further in favor of debtors than Los

16

Angeles lumber.

17
18

MR. CONN:

The Bankruptcy Code went much further in

favor of debtors in several cases.

19

QUESTION:

But on this particular point.

£0

MR. CONN:

Not on this point.

In fact, the key point

£1

on that, Your Honor,

is that when the Tulsa revision of the

dc!

bankruptcy laws was proposed by the Bankruptcy Commission,

33

there was recognition that there were some special difficulties

£4

for individual debtors and there was recognition that maybe the

£5

rule of Los Angeles Lumber of this Court was too harsh.

7

the issue of cram down comes into play or that the veto power

8

of the absolute priority rule if you will, comes into play.

9

In the briefs submitted by the Respondents and their

10

amicus curiae supporters, there seems to be an argument made

11

that the absolute priority provisions of the Bankruptcy Code

12

somehow should make a distinction between individual debtors

13

and corporate debtors, such that, while it is appropriate to

14

apply the absolute priority rule to prevent shareholders of a

15

corporation from retaining equity interest,

16

appropriate to apply that rule where the debtor is an

17

individua1.

18

it is somehow not

I think, the response to that argument is twofold.

19

First, the? plain language of the absolute priority rule in the

20

statute does not admit of any distinction between individual

21

and corporate debtors.
Throughout the Bankruptcy Code,

it is clear that when

Congress chosen to deal with particular needs of particular
£4
£5

classes of debtors,

it has done so.

For example, only individuals can exempt certain

i

property from the estate under Section 5££.

Only individuals

can avoid liens on exempt property under that same section.

3

Only individuals are entitled to a complete discharge of debt

4

under Section 7£7.

5
6

7

9

Only farmers are immune from involuntary bankruptcy
cases under Section 03.
In addition,

Congress has made special provisions for

individuals and farmers in Chapters 1£ and 13.

11

could have.

18

With all respect,

I think, that the ruling in Case v.

19

Los Pinge I es Lumber is to the contrary and does not support the

£0

position of the panel decision in the Court of Appeals.

£1

In fact,

the Los Angeles Lumber case reversed

decisions of the lower Courts which allowed equity owners’
retention of equity interests in a bankruptcy where the

c.

That is very close,

I think, to what the Court of

Appeals has done below in this case, and Case v. Los Angeles
Lumber simply doesn’t support it.

4

What the Court of Appeals did and what the

5

Respondents and their amicus supporters strive to do here,

6

to fit this sweat equity notion within the apparent exception

7

of Case v. Los Angeles Lumber that would have allowed existing

8

shareholders to participate in a reorganisation in exchange for

9

an infusion of new capital.

10

is

The argument goes that because the debtor in this

1 1

case will agree to provide services in the future, that is the

1£

equivalent of new capital for the operation and therefore it is

13

not a violation of the absolute priority rule to allow the

14

debtor to retain all interest in the property.

15

There are several problems with that.

16

would apply in virtually any Chapter 11 case involving an

17

individual debtor because obviously it is implicit in any

18

individual reorganisation that the individual intends to keep

13

working t he business.

£0
£1

First,

it

The next argument that is made by the Respondents is
that the debtor really would not be retaining anything here,
because what is being retained is of no value.

The debtor has

no equity in the property, therefore it is valueless, therefore
£4
£5

it is not a retention.
The problem with that analysis is that obviously,

Any time I take out a loan for my business,

in my promise to repay is that I am going to work in the

What is happening in this situation is that the

debtor is seeking to have the level of debt structured down in

SI

bankruptcy and then saying okay, now I am going to promise to

repay this lower debt by working the business, which is

dixi*

precisely what the original promise implied.

£4

In that context, there is nothing new.

£5

Secondly, on that same point, the notion that the

In short,

Os in Los Ongeles Lumber,

It has no present value for liquidation

it does not enhance the estate for

creditors at all.
If the plan fails, the promise of the debtor to work

i.™ c.

rights than they would have had before, and therefore,

C.' s.J

believe, a totally illusory obligation.

£4
£5

it

it is,

I

Finally, and I think in the broader context here, the
difficulty with what flhlers does in the overall context of the

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
<£0£) 6£8-4888

18

1

Bankruptcy Code is that it severely upsets the relative

c.

bargaining positions between the debtor on the one hand and the
creditors on the other.

4

It gives a very strong tool to debtors in virtually

5

ever case involving an individual reorganisation, which is a

6

far departure from what at least I believe Congress had in

7

rn i nd.

8

The real upshot of flhlers is that, contrary to the

3

provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, which contemplated that a

10

secured creditor should be able,

if criteria were met, to

11

obtain a. decision on a lift stay motion within 30 days after

1£

making that motion, and if the stay were not lifted that the

13

creditor would receive protection of its interest during the

14

duration of the bankruptcy case that has been turned upside

15

down by the flhlers decision.

16

What has been seen in this case is that the

17

Petitioners, who started out as secured creditors and now hold

IS

dual roles, have been precluded for three years from enforcing

13

their rights in collateral, which has probably been declining

during the interim, and they are now confronted,

The responses to these problems as perceived are

invariably legislative responses rather than calling for

changing dramatically the provisions of Chapter 11 of the

Bankruptcy Code.

8

I think, that Congress, through Chapter 1£, and the

9

various state legislatures through their Farm Mediation Acts

MR. CONN:

7

I agree with Mr. Needier that the Ahlers decision has

sweeping ramifications.

in the Eighth Circuit, and, to a lesser degree, elsewhere.

10

*

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

It has had substantial ramifications

Among the problems with the lower Court’s decision in

11

Ahlers is that it is not limited or limitable to the perceived

12

problems with agriculture, but rather,

13

in any Chapter 11 reorganization proceeding.

14

it is equally applicable

It has substantially altered, as Judge Gibson said in

15

dissent, substant i a 11y altered the relationship between debtor

1£

and creditor and it is far beyond anything that Congress

17

intended.

18

With respect to the voting question raised by Mr.

19

Needier, that the creditors should somehow be estopped from

£0

voting against whatever plan is proposed, the answer to that is

£1

that the Bankruptcy Code specifically provides that a secured

C.C.

creditor who becomes undersecured is treated as an unsecured

lIC. u)

creditor for the balance of its claim and is entitled to the

£4

same voting rights as any other unsecured creditor.

£5

And if those creditors control the group of unsecured
