We'll hear argument first

Mr. Kneedler, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. KNEEDLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The question in this case is whether copies of

12

presentence reports that are in the possession of the Parole

13

Commission are subject to mandatory release under the public

14

disclosure provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.

15

presentence reports have long been regarded as highly

16

confidential documents.

17

ability of the probation officers who prepare the reports to

18

obtain information from various sources.

The

That confidentiality protects the

19

For this reason, the courts have uniformly held that

20

presentence reports are not routinely available to persons who

21

might seek to discover contents for use in litigation.

22

submit that this governmental privilege permits the Parole

23

Commission to withhold their copies of presentence reports from

24

the general public under Exemption 5 of the Freedom of

25

Information Act.

We

Respondents concede that presentence reports are

Heritage

3
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

highly confidential documents and that they are almost

2

invariably exempt from mandatory release under the Act.

3

they submit that because they are the subjects of the

4

presentence reports, the persons about whom the reports were

5

prepared they have a special right under FOIA that isn't shared

6

by any other member of the public to read those reports.

But

It is our position in this case that that argument is

7
8

inconsistent both with settled principles under the Freedom of

9

Information Act, and also with settled principles covering

10

disclosure of presentence reports.
QUESTION:

11

Mr. Kneedler, there are provisions of the

12

Parole Commission and Reorganization Act that specify certain

13

types of information in the reports that I guess both sides

14

agree may be deleted or excluded from any report before

15

release.

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

17

shown to the defendant.

18

QUESTION:

That's right.

Right.

They can't even be

So what is left then in the report

19

that the Government is particularly concerned about protecting

20

after the deletion of those sensitive things?

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, the reports contain a wealth of

22

information concerning the individual's background, but also

23

the background of his family, his relationships with

24

associates, employers.

25

personal both to the defendant and others.
QUESTION:

There's a lot of information that is

Well, I suppose most of that would be
4

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

covered by Exemption 6?

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

3

QUESTION:

It may or may not be.

It depends.

I'm just wondering what's left after you

4

take out the sensitive things and take out what Exemption 6

5

covers.

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, there's also information that's

7

furnished by sources of information that may not be regarded as

8

so confidential that the defendant can't even see that

9

information.

If it was that confidential, then that could be

10

withheld under one of the provisions to which you're referring.

11

But there's also a more general desire to maintain

12

confidentiality to encourage sources to come forward.

Because

3

as the Administrative Office explained to the Parole Commission

4

when they were considering whether to change their policy, all

5

sources of information are told what they furnish to the

6

probation officer will be shown to the defendant and shown to

7

the attorney for the Government, but that the defendant cannot

8

keep a copy of it.

9

initial showing only with the consent of the Court.

And that it will be disclosed beyond that
And this

20

affords the sources some sense of protection and confidence

21

that the report that contains their disclosures will not be

22

passed on by the defendant, for example if he gets a copy of

23

it, to third persons who might use it.

24
25

QUESTION:

What's to prevent him from making a copy

for his own use or his counsel from making a copy in these days
of copying machines.
5

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

MR. KNEEDLER:

1

Well, the rules do not permit that and

2

the standard procedure, Rule 32 C at sentencing, for example,

3

says that the defendant and the counsel for the Government may

4

read a copy of the report.

5

uses.

6

the Rule stated that all copies of the report must be returned

7

to the Court and copies could not be made.

8

9

And that's the word that the Rule

And when the Rule was proposed, this Court's version of

Congress modified that to permit the Court, in its
discretion, on an occasional case to let the defendant keep a

10

copy of the report.

11

of the report must be returned to the Court.

12

defendant to make a copy of it would be directly inconsistent

13

with that requirement that they be returned.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

But Rule 32 specifically says all copies
And for the

But the Rule doesn't apply to the Parole

Commission, I gather?
MR. KNEEDLER:

No, but the Parole Commission from the

17

outset has followed directly parallel procedures.

18

makes a lot of sense, because when the Parole Commission Act

19

was passed in 1976, Congress saw it as a continuation of the

20

sentencing process.

21

typically, and then the Parole Commission decides how much of

22

that the defendant will serve.

23

QUESTION:

24
25

And this

The Court sets the sentence within a range

Yes, but it makes it very hard to argue

that it falls under Exemption 3.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, we submit that it does because

Rule 32 specifically provides that the report is to be returned
6

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

to the Court upon the completion of sentencing, and obviously

2

the defendant can't get a copy of the report from the Court

3

unless the Court in its discretion permits him to do so.

4

same authority to withhold, we submit, attaches to the report

5

as it's transferred to the Parole Commission.

6

Our basic submission in this case --

7

QUESTION:

8

9

That

Do you have any case that upholds your

position on Exemption 3?
MR. KNEEDLER:

There's no case specifically relating

10

to the presentence reports, no.

11

of Exemption 3 are met in this case.

12

statutes that refer to particular matters to be withheld.

13

is a statute that refers to particular matters to be withheld,

14

presentence reports, and those are the specific requirements.

15

But the express requirements
Exemption 3(b) refers to
This

Respondents say that because Rule 32 speaks to the

16

Court and doesn't expressly refer to the Parole Commission,

17

that it's not an Exemption 3 statute.

18

require that the statute on which withholding rests

19

specifically refer to the agency that happens to be in the

20

possession of the report, and that requirement would make no

21

sense, because the statute speaks to the document to be

22

withheld and reflects an assessment by Congress as to whether

23

that document should be withheld.

24
25

QUESTION:

Exemption 3(b) does not

Doesn't that exemption also require that

either the inability to obtain it be absolute or that the
specific standard for making it available be set forth?

Heritage

(202) 628-4888

MR. KNEEDLER:

1
2

QUESTION:

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

What's the specific standard here?
There are actually three separate

4

subparts to Exemption 3.

Exemption 3(a) refers to situations

5

in which the report can be withheld in the manner that leaves

6

no discretion.

7

statutes that refer to particular criteria, and the other in

8

the alternative, the statute can refer to particular matters to

9

be withheld.

Exemption 3(b) has two alternatives.

One, the

Those are in the alternative.

In this case, we're relying on the part of the

10
11

statute that refers to particular matters to be withheld,

12

presentence reports.

13

statute also contain criteria.

14

narrowing the categories of information that could be withheld.

15

And what it said is, well, if the statute specifically tells

16

the administrator how to decide what to withhold, that's an

17

exemption 3 statute.

18

document.

21

What Congress was aiming at was

Or as here refers to a particular

And Rule 32 specifically refers to presentence

19
20

That part does not require that the

reports.
QUESTION:

Doesn't that last exemption have to be

22

absolute, that is, matters to be withheld.

23

matters to be withheld absolutely?

24

MR. KNEEDLER:

25

Doesn't it mean

Well, if that were true, it would be

redundant with respect to Exemption 3(a) which does require
that it be absolute and that there be no discretion.
8

Heritage

Exemption

1

3(b) for instance in the CIA v. Sims, which was a 3(b) statute

2

case, the Court recognized that the Director of the CIA had the

3

discretion to release information that he was charged with

4

protecting, and that was committed to his discretion, and that

5

did not undermine the 3(b) status of the report.
And 3(b) is particularly apt in this case we think

6

7

because Congress specifically focused on the question, really

8

the question in this case, whether the subject of the report

9

should have a right to receive a copy of that report.

And

10

Congress, like this Court, in promulgating the rule decided

11

that he should not.

12

Our basic submission in this case, though, is that

13

these reports are protected by Exemption 5 of the Freedom of

14

Information Act.

15

memorandums that would not be available by law to a party in

16

litigation with the agency.

17

held, as I mentioned before, that presentence reports are not

18

routinely available to persons seeking to discover them for use

19

in pending litigation.

Exemption 5 refers to inter or intra agency

QUESTION:

20

And the Courts have uniformly

But I guess there is a split of authority

21

on whether they are inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums.

22

Is that right?
MR. KNEEDLER:

23
24

that question.

25

that.

There's not a split of authority on

Respondents argue that they are not covered by

The Court of Appeals in this case, although respondent

Julian argued that, the Court of Appeals didn't address it, and

Heritage

9
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

the District of Columbia Circuit, in the Durns case, held that

2

they are.

And we think that that's pretty clear in this case.

3

The phrases inter agency and intra agency

4

memorandums, as we see it, was designed to refer to materials

5

that are kept internal to the Government.

6

Circuit said in the Ryan case which is really the leading case

7

on construing this phrase, there's no indication that Congress

8

intended those to be rigidly exclusive terms, but rather were

9

intended to encompass materials that are incorporated into the

10
11

And as the D.C.

deliberative process of the agency.
And here we think that's particularly clear because

12

Congress has in effect recognized that the probation officer

13

prepares the report for the Parole Commission as well as the

14

Court, directed the probation officer to furnish it to the

15

Court, and directed the Parole Commission to consider the

16

report as part of its deliberative process.

17

really the most basic document traditionally that the Parole

18

Commission and the Bureau of Prisons rely upon.

19

QUESTION:

In fact, it's

Mr. Kneedler, you can't say that just

20

incorporating it into the deliberative process is the

21

criterion. You can get a memorandum from the National

22

Association of Manufacturers that the agency considers, and --

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

It can't be just something

24

volunteered by an outsider.

But here, Congress has effectively

25

made the probation officer part of the deliberative process by
directing that he furnish the report that he has made to the
10

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1

Parole Commission.

2

QUESTION:

Do you think it could encompass an NAM

3

memorandum if the law required the agency to consider NAM

4

memoranda?
MR. KNEEDLER:

5

Well, I think it would depend on

6

whether the statute effectively made the NAM part of the

7

Government's decisionmaking process.

8

they said, consider as under the APA, an agency would typically

9

have a duty to consider comments submitted by any outsider.

10

It would be one thing if

We're not arguing that.

11

What we are arguing is where the entity outside the

12

Government submits something to the agency, effectively as an

13

agent of the Government, not as an outsider, then Exemption 5

14

applies.

15

or five circuits that have uniformly held that submissions by

16

outside consultants or experts that are retained by an agency

17

in a particular occasion to submit reports to an agency in

18

connection with some project, that those reports are covered by

19

Exemption 5.

20

process occasionally requires an inclusion of materials

21

obtained from outsiders.

22

As we cite in our brief, there are cases from four

Because Congress recognized that the deliberative

QUESTION:

But the are in those consultant cases, the

23

consultants are really working for another agency in any case.

24

They are part of the executive branch.

25

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, not necessarily.

In a number of

cases we've referred to, these are private persons who are in
11

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

effect part of the agency.

This is on intra agency rationale,

2

the outside consultants are really part of the agency for that

3

purpose because it's necessary for the agency to use their

4

services in connection with a deliberation.
As we point out in our brief, this view is also

5
6

reflected in the background of FOIA itself.

7

recognized in Weber Aircraft for example, the Machin Privilege

8

which protects reports concerning aircraft accidents, the

9

Machin Privilege was specifically considered by Congress and

Both as this Court

10

one that Congress intended to make applicable under Exemption

11

5.

Well, in Machin itself, the witness statements that

12

13

were involved were statements of outsiders.

14

statements of -- perhaps some of them were but the principal

15

focus was on a report that was not submitted by a person in the

16

agency.

They were not

17

And other privileges under Exemption 5 such as the

18

work product privilege, it would be odd to cut the privilege

19

off depending upon whether the person submitting a statement

20

was in the Government or outside.

21

privileges where the agency might have to rely on some

22

materials submitted from outside, and for that purpose, the

23

submitter is regarded as part of the agency.

24
25

So there are a number of

With respect to the further requirements of Exemption
5, as I've said, I think now eight circuits have made clear
that presentence reports are not routinely available to persons
12

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

seeking them in civil discovery.

2

5 is whether a document is routinely or normally available to a

3

person on civil discovery.

4

available to a person who has a special connection with it or a

5

special interest in it, or a special need for it.
QUESTION:

6

And the test under Exemption

Not whether it might be made

Are those cases where the defendant after

7

incarceration is suing to get some change in his status and

8

requests through discovery a copy of this report?

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, the cases that we've relied upon

10

have generally been where third parties have sought copies of

11

the reports, either in connection with pending civil litigation

12

or in some cases in criminal litigation where the defendant has

13

sought the report of a Government witness or a codefendant.

14
15

But again the test under Exemption 5 is whether they
would normally be available.

16

QUESTION:

But one would think though, just as a

17

matter of off the top of the head so to speak, that if the sort

18

of suit was brought that I described, that probably this would

19

be available to a plaintiff suing the Government.
MR. KNEEDLER:

20

Well, it depends.

In the sort of

21

case, you're describing it may be.

22

defendant is suing the Government in a way that relates to the

23

presentence report and he could make a showing of special

24

particularized need for the report, he could obtain a copy of

25

it then.
QUESTION:

For example, if the

But why shouldn't that defeat Exemption 5?

Heritage

13
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

MR. KNEEDLER:

1

Because the subject of the report

2

just like any member of the public could get a copy of the

3

report only upon a showing of special need.

4

handed out as a matter of course.
QUESTION:

6

7

process.

8

9

It's not routinely

Well, nothing is routinely handed out in

I mean, you have to go through the discovery

MR. KNEEDLER:
routinely made available.

That's right.

But I mean, it's not

It is privileged and the person

10

seeking the document in the litigation with the agency would

11

have to show a special need for it.

12

the information from some other --

13

QUESTION:

That he couldn't obtain

Well, then are you saying then that for

14

the number of Section 5 or subsection 5 privilege to attach,

15

it's enough that in the litigation where the person would

16

ultimately obtain discovery, they have to make a showing that

17

they need it?

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, that's the general rule under

19

Exemption 5.

In fact, under Grolier, the Court faced a very

20

similar situation.

21

previous litigation involving the subsidiary of Grolier,

22

itself, the requester, had ordered the disclosure of the

23

particular documents on the ground that the plaintiff there had

24

made a showing of particularized need.

25

made then in the FOIA case that that prior order demonstrates

There the argument was made that a court in

And the argument was

that the document shouldn't be withheld because it had been
14
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

2

ordered disclosed in discovery.
The Court said no, that isn't the test.

The question

3

is whether it would be routinely available, not the question of

4

whether it would be made available upon a special showing.

5

And in this case, the only times that the defendant

6

sees a copy of his presentence report are where Congress has in

7

effect deemed him to have made a special showing.

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Kneedler, do you take the

position that the Parole Commission may not give a copy to the

10

defendant if it chooses to do so?

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, we don't.

12

absolute position.

13

the Crooker case.

14

And that's the se are agency records.

15
16
17
18
19

We don't take that

And that was the subject of our filing in
And we continue to abide by that position.
We do acknowledge that.

But by the same token, we think that the Parole
Commission is not obligated to turn them over to the defendant.
QUESTION:

Could the defendant possibly get a copy

under the Privacy Act?
MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

The Privacy Act permits an agency

20

to exempt certain systems of records from the provisions of the

21

Privacy Act.

22

the Bureau of Prisons have exempted the files containing the

23

presentence report from the Private Access provisions of the

24

Privacy Act.

25

defendant has no private right of access under the Privacy ACt,

And in this case, the Parole Commission and also

And it seems to us to be quite anomalous if the

which was designed for that purpose, that he should be able to
15

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

invoke the public access provisions of the Freedom of

2

Information Act to obtain a copy of the report.
And going back to the question you asked, Justice

3
4

O'Connor, it seems to us that where the document really has a

5

dual status, it's an important essential document for the Court

6

and an essential document for the Agency, it makes no sense for

7

the Parole Commission, either voluntarily or for it to have to

8

under FOIA to disclose a document that the Court would not

9

disclose.

10

And therefore the Parole Commission has tried to

11

reach a harmonious approach in this area, whereby it will not

12

release a copy of the presentence report to the defendant if

13

the Court wouldn't do it.

14

cross purposes.

15

legislative history of the Parole Act that that was somehow

16

prohibited to the Parole Commission, that it had to routinely

17

dispense with the confidentiality of reports.

18

Otherwise, they would be working at

And there's no indication at all in the

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, can I ask you a question.

19

Supposing, just looking at the language of Exemption 5,

20

supposing the inmate brought some kind of an action against the

21

Parole Commission claiming he was entitled to more of a hearing

22

given certain information based on certain information that was

23

in his presentence report, and that the presentence report was

24

clearly relevant to the charges he made, and that what he

25

needed to see was not part that could have been withheld from
him but would have been ordinarily disclosed to him, would that

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I think no.

whether he would have a special need for it.
QUESTION:

Well, the need is it's relevant to the

5

lawsuit, that's the special need.

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

7

QUESTION:

8

10

11

I mean, the test is

It's relevant but the question —

Which is generally the test in any

discovery proceeding, it's got to be some showing of relevance.
MR. KNEEDLER:

But it's quite clear that presentence

reports are not generally available.
QUESTION:

But also you don't have an awful lot of

12

litigation between inmates and the particular agency having

13

custody of it.

14

and the agency and it relates to something in the report which

15

he had a right to see but not keep earlier, why wouldn't that

16

routinely be made available.

17

But when there is litigation between the inmate

MR. KNEEDLER:

That's what I want to know?

Well, what might happen is that the

18

Court might readily find that he has a special interest in it,

19

and a special need to see it because the litigation relates

20

directly to the presentence report.

into account in deciding whether the defendant should be able

that the Court again would not just hand him a copy of the

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

10

Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.

We'll hear now from you, Mr. Glitzenstein.

11

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC ROBERT GLITZENSTEIN, ESQ.

12

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

13
14
15

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.
Much of the Government's argument seems to be

16

contending that unless Congress has in some way required it in

17

a statute other than the Freedom of Information Act that

18

presentence reports be disclosed to prisoners who are otherwise

19

entitled to see them before sentencing and parole hearings,

20

that it needn't provide copies of those reports.

21

But that stands the entire concept of the Freedom of

22

Information Act on its head.

The whole purpose of the FOIA was

23

to essentially require the Government to make available to

24

requesters Federal agency records, unless the Government can

25

point to a specific exemption which authorizes the Government
to withhold that information.

Heritage

23
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

We would submit that it is quite plain that neither

2

of the two exemptions relied upon by the Government here,

3

Exemptions 3 or 5, are applicable to requests by the subjects

4

of presentence reports for copies of material they have already

5

been permitted to see pursuant to not one but two statutory

6

directives.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Glitzenstein, the fact that the

8

request is by the subject of the report is it conceded that

9

that's irrelevant?

10

11

I mean, if you're right that the subject of

the report can get it, anybody can get it.
MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

Isn't that so?

Your Honor, I believe that

12

Exemption 6 was crafted to deal precisely with the distinction

13

between first party and third party requests.

14

of that Exemption states that information shall not be

15

released, or may not be released if in fact the disclosure of

16

the information would create an unwarranted invasion of

17

personal privacy.

18

The phraseology

I would submit it is quite plain that when personal

19

information is released to the individual who is the subject of

20

the information, there cannot in the language of the exemption

21

be an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.

22

third party seeks access to that information, there may very

23

well be an invasion of personal privacy subject to that

24

particular exemption.

25

QUESTION:

However, if a

Well, that's true as far as personal

privacy is concerned, but as far as exposing the identity of

Heritage

24
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

people who spoke about the individual were, what they said, and

2

other such matters, that could be obtained not only by the

3

defendant but by anybody, presumably.

4

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

I think again, it would depend

5

upon an analysis of the particular exemption involved.

For

6

example, if one were dealing with confidential sources, then

7

one would look at whether Congress has in some way exempted

8

confidential source information not only from the defendant but

9

from the world at large.

And we would submit that it's quite

10

clear, as we have conceded in this case, and I think as two

11

circuit courts have now held, the confidential source material

12

clearly can be withheld not only from the defendant but from

13

the rest of the world as well.

14

QUESTION:

But if it has to go to the defendant, it

15

has to go to the rest of the world, isn't that right, except

16

for those personal matters that relate only to the defendant.

17

That arguably could be kept out from the rest of the world

18

under 6.

19

if the defendant can get it, anybody can get it.
MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

20
21

But all the other stuff about confidential sources,

I believe that's basically our

argument, yes, Your Honor.

22

I think it's conceivable if I might just amend that

23

partially that there could be in some instances a Governmental

24

privilege.

25

disclosure from third parties but not necessarily from first

I don't think one exists here, that protects

parties, depending upon the kind of Governmental interest that
25

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

was being articulated.
I don't think this qualifies as such a privilege as I

2

3

will indicate in my remarks in a moment.

But I think it's

4

conceivable that justice Exemption 6 may turn on whether the

5

exemption would apply depending upon who the requester is, it

6

is conceivable that there is privileges that are crafted by the

7

courts for discovery proceedings could turn on the nature of

8

the requester.
But I would say as a general rule that you're

9
10

absolutely right that release of information to one party would

11

involve release of information to the world at large.
I just have a few remarks about the Exemption 3

12

13

claim.

14

the Government is really overreaching in this case in an effort

15

to argue that these particular documents are exempt from their

16

subjects.

17

amended in 1976 for the precise purpose of very carefully

18

narrowing the kinds of statutory schemes that would qualify as

19

withhold statutes under the particular exemption.

20

Because I believe it helps to put in perspective why

As we have argued in our brief, Exemption 3 was

As it is now crafted, as Mr. Kneedler pointed out, it

21

only covers information that specifically is exempted from

22

disclosure by statute providing that the statute either a)

23

requires that the matter be withheld from the public in such a

24

manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or b)

25

establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to
particular types of materials to be withheld.

Heritage

26
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

In crafting that language, the legislative history of

2

the amendment makes it quite clear — and this is how it's been

3

largely construed by the courts -- particular documents cannot

4

be withheld unless Congress has in some way told an agency how

5

to exercise its discretion in order to release or withhold that

6

information.

7

in some way to withhold material from a requester, the

8

exemption does not apply.

9

And thus where a statute does not tell an agency

We would submit in this case it is quite clear that

10

as to three specific categories of information which are

11

sometimes contained in presentence reports, Congress made that

12

determination quite explicit.

13

of the Parole Act, the Parole Commission is authorized to

14

withhold from everyone, including subjects of the reports,

15

material revealing sources of confidentiality obtained under a

16

promise of confidentiality as well as two other specific

17

categories of information.

18

And thus under Section 4208(c)

That clearly reflects Congress' judgment that that

19

kind of information could occasion some harm if released.

20

is just as clear that as to other portions of presentence

21

reports which may otherwise be shown to the prisoner, then

22

there is no harm that Congress foresaw in the disclosure of

23

that information, and it did not direct the Parole Commission

24

to decline to release that particular information.

25

It

In fact, the Chairman of the Parole Commission has
himself recognized that in various documents that we have

included in our brief, as well as documents attached to the

2

Government's Petition for Certiorari.
QUESTION:

3

Mr. Glitzenstein, do you concede that a

4

court would not be required to give the defendant a copy under

5

Rule 32?
MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

6

That's correct, Your Honor.

Rule

7

32(c)(3)(e) specifically gives the courts the authority to

8

disclose copies, or I think in the language of that provision,

9

to require return to the Court.

But I think that helps our

10

case here.

11

it enacted the provisions of the Parole Act.

12

Because Congress did not adopt that provision when

Tellingly, it adopted virtually every other portion

13

of Rule 32(c) verbatim, when it enacted the Parole Act,

14

including almost precise parallels for the three categories of

15

data including confidential sources that may be withheld.

16

it did not include the requirement that is contained in Rule

17

32(c)(3)(e).

18

that was a purposeful deliberate determination by Congress to

19

essentially authorize the Parole Commission to release copies

20

of the reports.

But

The conclusion seems inescapable therefore that

21

And as the Chairman of the Parole Commission himself

22

has said, the fact that the Parole Commission is authorized to

23

withhold confidential sources suggests that in response to FOIA

24

requests, "in cases where there is confidential material which

25

is not to be shown to the defendant, such material can be
withheld under the FOIA, as well."

Heritage

He went on to say that

28
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

giving prisoners copies of presentence reports that they have

2

already been permitted to read will pose, "no threat to the

3

willingness of confidential sources to come forward because the

4

probation officer can still guarantee confidentiality under the

5

FOIA."
QUESTION:

6

Mr. Glitzenstein, now you could say the

7

same thing with respect to the Rule.

Could you give me some

8

reason why it makes sense to allow the Parole Commission to do

9

what the court is specifically forbidden from doing.

It's such

10

an odd thing to specifically forbid the Court from turning it

11

over, but then when the Court gives it to the Parole

12

Commission, allowing the Parole Commission to turn it over.

13

And if I have a statute that arguably prevents the Parole

14

Commission just as it prevents the Court, I'm inclined to read

15

the law to make some sense.

16
17

Now, tell me why it makes any sense to allow the
Parole Commission to do it when the court can't?
MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

18

First of all, Your Honor, I would

19

like to just emphasize that I think that clearly is what

20

Congress did both in the plain language of the two statutes by

21

not adopting Rule 32(c)(3)(e) and in legislative history of the

22

Parole Act where it authorized independent determinations.
QUESTION:

23

You're saying Congress is privileged to

24

make no sense if it wants to, and I agree with you.

25

with you.

If that's what they said, that's fine.

assume that I want to try to make it make sense.

Heritage

29
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

I agree
But let's

Now, why

1

would it make sense to allow the Parole Commission to turn it

2

over?

3

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

I think the reason it makes sense

4

is when you look at the purpose of Rule 32(c) was essentially

5

to give the Court control over that document up until the end

6

of the sentencing process.

7

Court including Williams v. New York, other cases which have

8

talked about the need for the sentencing judge to supervise the

9

sentencing process. And I think what Congress was saying was

There have been cases from this

10

that up until the sentencing judge completes sentencing, then

11

the sentencing judge could essentially exercise that kind of

12

supervision and control over all of the documents that come

13

before the Judge and are used in the sentencing process,

14

perhaps to prevent unnecessary delay if he believes that a

15

particular defendant will take the presentence report and do

16

things with it that the judge may not like.

17

But whatever the reasons, what I think Congress was

18

doing was splitting this up and saying, up until the time of

19

sentencing you are using the report exclusively, and you can

20

keep control of the materials that are being used.

21

goes to correctional authorities and it takes on entirely

22

different kind of significance and is used in totally distinct

23

kinds of determinations, then we want the Federal Statutes,

24

including the Parole Act and other relevant statutes to kick in

25

and to control the way in which these reports are used and
disseminated.

Heritage

30
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

But once it

1

And I think in keeping that in mind, it's crucial to

2

focus on the fact that presentence reports are not only used in

3

parole determinations by the Parole Commission, but as our

4

brief points out, they are used in a whole host of correctional

5

decisions the second that that prisoner walks through

6

institutional doors.

7

institution that person will be put in, the nature of the

8

security that will be imposed, furloughs, what sorts of

9

rehabilitation and correctional systems will be put into place.

It's used to determine the kind of

10

Virtually every aspect of the prisoner's day to day life will

11

be impacted perhaps by the presentence report.

12

And what Congress was saying was since that is the

13

case we do not want the sentencing Court and its use of this

14

report and control of the report under Rule 32(c) to have a

15

continuing bearing upon what the Parole Commission does with

16

that document and what other correctional authorities do with

17

that document.

18

QUESTION:

All those good things you've just said,

19

those good uses all relate to use by the particular defendant.

20

It's very strange for Congress to serve those purposes by

saying the document shall be available to the world at large

particular defendant in passing the Parole Act, where Congress
3

specifically required that the document be made available to

5

But secondly, and I think the more general answer is,

6

the exemptions to the FOIA apply to any Federal agency record

7

that a Federal agency happens to have ink its possession.

8

the Government has conceded since the Crooker case that these

9

presentence reports are Federal agency records.

And

And therefore

10

the only way to analyze pursuant to Congressional intent,

11

whether the document may be withheld in a particular

12

circumstance, is by analyzing whether a specific exemption

13

might apply.

14
*
r

again, I think that Congress did focus on the need of the

And as I mentioned before when one is looking at

15

giving out documents of this nature to the world at large, then

16

Congress intended the Exemption 6 privacy analysis to be the

17

kind of test that would be applied by courts in applying the

18

FOIA exemptions.

19

that might be involved in any determination made by an agency,

20

medical records, social security records, Veterans

21

Administration records, the Exemption 6 test was crafted for

22

precisely that purpose.

And just like any other personal information

23

And I think that is the way in which courts should

24

analyze this kind of case as well as other kinds of cases in

material, but the world at large would not necessarily be in a

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

Your Honor, I think it is clear

that some lower courts have in some instances withheld copies

from sentencing courts.

to look carefully at what those courts said.

12

13

i

Mr. Glitzenstein, do you concede that some

Because it is

In those cases, the Courts began their analysis, and

14

again, this is sentencing courts, usually codefendants were

15

attempting to obtain copies of other peoples' presentence

16

reports by specifically saying, that the usual rule when a

17

defendant is trying to obtain his or her own presentence report

18

is created by Rule 32 and the Parole Act, and first parties

19

ordinarily permitted to obtain copies of their presentence

20

reports without showing any special need, without demonstrating

21

that they have any overriding interest in obtaining that

22

information just by showing that it's relevant to the

23

proceedings.

24
25

Then those Courts, and again, I'm referring precisely
to the cases that are cited by the Government, Figurski,

By the same token, it is quite

In fact, the case we cite in our brief, which I think

10

answers Mr. Kneedler's arguments quite effectively is Rone v.

11

United States, a Seventh Circuit Case, in which the Court

12

reviewed amendments to Rule 32(c), as well as the Parole Act

13

that was adopted in 1976 and said these cases not only give

14

prisoners a right to get access to these documents by

initiating an FOIA request, they go even further than that.

They impose an affirmative duty on sentencing courts and on the

material that we may very well rely upon in making a sentencing

statutes that Congress crafted, that prisoners and defendants

1

Government can argue that these are not routinely available to

2

prisoners in discovery proceedings.
The final point that I would like to make, or one of

3
4

the final points I'd like to make about the Government's

5

analysis, is that it would cut against the grain of what this

6

Court said in the Federal Open Market Committee v. Merrill

case.

8

certain kind of discovery privilege, stated that it would,

9

"hesitate to construe Exemption 5 to incorporate a civil

In which this Court in the process of recognizing a

10

discovery privilege that would substantially duplicate another

11

FOIA exemption."
Here, it is quite clear that any conceivable interest

12

13

the Government has in withholding these documents is

14

adequately, more than adequately met by other exemptions.

15

noted above, we concede the Ninth Circuit held, the First

16

Circuit has held, that confidential source material constitutes

17

an Exemption 3 statute under the Parole Act, and can be

18

withheld.

As I

By the same token, any legitimate privacy interest

19
20

clearly could be met through the contours of Exemption 6, and

21

by applying that Exemption. And so it's also quite possible

22

that other exemptions would apply to specific portions of the

23

reports.

24

But it is quite clear that the Government's

25

presentence report privilege is certainly not needed because of
the other FOIA exemptions.

Heritage

In addition, it would do something

37
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

that would have very untoward effects on Exemption 6 and the

2

rest of the FOIA.

3

approach to Exemption 5, is prevent individuals from ever using

4

the Freedom of Information Act to obtain their own personal

5

information, because the more sensitive, the more personal the

6

information, it seems quite clear the more the Government would

7

be able to argue that it is note quote unquote routinely

8

available to third parties in discovery proceedings.

9

In effect what it would do as we read their

And that could then be used under Exemption 5 to

10

prevent first parties from obtaining access to their own

11

reports and their own documents.

12

think it's quite important to focus on the fact that Congress

13

itself saw the FOIA as a tool for obtaining first party

14

information, that is, individuals getting their own records.

15

And in that connection, I

Contrary to the suggestion by Mr. Kneedler, Congress

16

did not only look at the privacy act as the vehicle for

17

obtaining first party information.

18

amended the Privacy Act for the specific purpose of saying that

19

just because information is not exempt under the Privacy Act

20

does not mean it would not be available under the FOIA. And the

21

legislative history says we see both of these statutes in

22

appropriate circumstances as vehicles for obtaining personal

information.

13

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

Your Honor, I think if one looks

14

at the classic Exemption 5 privileges which the courts early on

15

incorporated into the Exemption and the ones that are

16

highlighted in the legislative history, one would have to come

17

out a different way on that.

18

Because, for example, deliberative process privilege,

19

which specifically was designed to protect drafts, working

20

papers, other kinds of documents shedding light on the

21

deliberative process, I think much of that material, and the

22

courts have made it clear that much of that material would not

23

necessarily be withholdable under other FOIA exemptions.

24

the same token, attorney client material, attorney work product

25

doctrine material, the two other core privileges that the

By

Courts have incorporated into Exemption 5, I cannot see how

Heritage

39
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

those would for the most part be withholdable under other

2

exemptions.

3

And so I think it is quite consistent with Congress'

4

intent to see whether or not a particular withholding that the

5

Government is interested in really goes to those kinds of core

6

Governmental interests that could not be protected under other

7

exemptions.

8

Committee v. Merrill, Congress drafted other exemptions of the

9

FOIA for the precise purpose of incorporating certain other

Because as this Court said in Federal Open Market

10

kinds of discovery privileges which were known to criminal and

11

civil discovery.

12

And therefore, it would really subvert the whole

13

purpose of Congress drafting those other specific exemptions to

14

lock stock and barrel put everything into Exemption 5.

15

sense, I think the Government's argument threatens to really

16

sweep up all those other exemptions and to either make them

17

irrelevant or worse, to essentially undercut the kinds of tests

18

for example under Exemption 6 that Congress really wanted the

19

courts to apply in making those kinds of determinations.

In a

20

And so I think that the only way really to avoid that

21

kind of hazard in really reading the rest of the exemptions out

22

of the statute is by doing what the Ninth Circuit did and that

23

is by recognizing that Congress can effectively say that

24

particular documents are not subject a discovery privilege and

25

that particular individuals are entitled to receive access to
those documents, and thus Exemption 5 should not apply to those

Heritage

40
Reporting Corporation

1

2

materials.
The last point that I would like to make involves the

3

fact that the Government's argument under Exemption 5 reads

4

another entire area of the law out of discovery, and that is

5

the law of waiver.

6

cases when the Government or some other party is arguing a

7

privilege applies, it is generally held that when your forfeit

8

confidentiality of the material, then you are no longer able to

9

argue that that information should be withheld from a party in

10
11

The notion being that in basic discovery

subsequent proceedings.
And I think in response to Justice Marshall's

12

inquiries, it is my understanding that not only prisoners and

13

their lawyers generally allowed to look at these documents, it

14

is my understanding that the Parole Commission in most

15

sentencing courts actually allow the prisoners and their

16

attorneys to take notes from the copies of the documents.

17

if one were really concerned about passing along information of

18

that nature to third parties, clearly taking verbatim notes

19

from the copies that are already provided the prisoners would

20

involve that kind of a harm.

21

So

And that is why the Parole Commission in the

22

documents that we cite in our briefs has said that we do not

23

see any incremental harm, quite frankly, in giving out copies

24

of documents that prisoners were already allowed to see on

25

several occasions and even take verbatim notes of.
I don't mean to suggest, I want to make it clear,

Heritage

that we think there is a genuine risk that prisoners will take

these reports and given them out to the world at large.

4

6

this incredibly sensitive personal information out.

These

But if that was a concern, that is a concern which

7
8

this particular exemption claim would not do anything to

9

prevent.

As a result, for these reasons, we believe that it is

10

quite clear that the Ninth Circuit was correct, both in its

11

application of the FOIA exemptions, and its determination that

12

there were no significant Governmental interests to be

13

protected by withholding copies of presentence reports, and we

14

therefore ask the Court to affirm the Ninth Circuit decision.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER, ESQ.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

There

are several points I'd like to make.
First, the privilege at issue here is not a privacy

23

privilege as respondents repeatedly suggest.

The reason why,

24

and we point this out in our reply brief and a number of cases

25

say this, the reason why courts do not disclose presentence
reports to parties seeking to discover them in litigation is

i

42
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

1

not the privacy of the defendant, that may be subsumed.

2

the overreaching rational is the Governmental interest, the

3

Governmental privilege in protecting the free flow of

4

information to the Government, to the probation officers.

5

rationale applies equally to giving a copy of the report to the

6

subject of the report as it does to third parties.

7

i
-

But

That

Also, the nature of the privilege requires that it be

8

as absolute as possible, so that the sources of information

9

will have confidence that their information will be tightly

10

held.

And in fact, as the Administrative Office pointed out to

11

the Parole Commission in the rulemaking proceeding, sources of

12

information are specifically told that

13

be only shown to the defendant and not made available to third

14

parties.

15

QUESTION:

their information will

Well, it's not really absolute.

This

16

exemption is not mandatory. The Government, even if we agree

with you that the exemption applies, the Government need not

invoke it.

20

privileges.

21

No, it's but that's true of a lot of

The Government may choose not to.

And related to that is the second point I wanted to

22

make.

Respondents make something of the point that the cases

23

we rely on refer to disclosures by the sentencing court, and

24

not the Parole Commission, and somehow they are different

25

considerations or different uses by the Parole Commission.
First of all, the use is essentially the same.

Heritage

43
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

The presentence

1

report is the essential document on which the sentencing

2

decision is made, the parole decision is made and incarceration

3

decisions are made.
But beyond that, the purposes of the privilege are

4
5

precisely the same in both contexts.

The purpose of the

6

privilege is to protect the integrity of the document by

7

securing the information from the sources.

8

applies equally to whether disclosure is made by the Parole

9

Commission or by the sentencing court, and in fact, the

That purpose

10

probation officer makes the report for the Parole Commission as

11

well as the sentencing court.
The third point I want to make is that respondents

12

13

are arguing for an exception to a general privilege under

14

Exemption 5 of the Freedom of Information Act, an exemption

15

which they essentially concede applies to members of the

16

public.

17

opinion in Durns permits no such distinction between the

18

requesters unlike Exemption 6.

Exemption 5 as Judge Wald said in her dissenting

19

But more importantly, if there was any doubt about

20

the existence of a special exemption, it's dispelled by Rule

21

32(c) in which Congress focused on the precise question here,

22

whether the subject of the report has a right or should have a

23

right to get it, Respondent's position would completely

24

undermine that decision.
