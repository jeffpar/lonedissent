ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS S. FRANECKE, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. FRANECKE:

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court.
This is a reargument of this case.

10

%

We'll hear argument now in

On April 27,

11.

1983, a 26 year old marine pilot was killed in the crash of a

12

Sikorsky helicopter within the three mile limit off the

13
14

Virginia coast.

His family sued Sikorsky for wrongful death.

At trial, both parties stipulated that Virginia law

15

applied.

16

defense, and respondents did not request one.

17

charged, however, with a Government contractor defense approved

18

by the respondents.

19

Government contractor defense as given by the trial court was

20

not a part of Virginia law and had not been adopted by the

21

Fourth Circuit at the time.

22

The iury was not charged with a Virqinia Loqan type
The jury was

This is despite the fact that the

The jury found against the respondents.

This is

23

despite this jury charge of the Government contractor defense,

24

thus respondents had not met their burden of proof at the trial

25

level.

Respondents appealed to the Fourth Circuit and did not

Heritage

3
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

4
1

challenge the Government contractor defense as given by the

2

trial court.

3

Virginia Logan defense.

They also then for the first time raised the

The Fourth Circuit, sua sponte, reversed the jury

4
5

verdict based on, one, the Government contractor defense it had

6

just announced that day in the Tozer case that they did not

7

then remand the case down to the trial level to determine the

8

facts based on the just announced Government contractor

9

defense, which we contend is a violation of a Seventh Amendment

10

right to a jury trial on the facts.
And secondly, based upon a Virginia Logan defense

11
12

which was not raised at trial and again did not remand on this

13

jury question back to the trial court level.

14

therefore asks in the alternative, three things.

Petitioner

The first thing, that the jury verdict be reinstated

15
16

because petitioner met their burden of proof, both under the

17

Government contractor defense and under a Logan type defense.

18

Two, in the alternative, that the jury verdict be

19

reinstated and that Congress be asked to consider a Government

20

contractor defense pursuant to an advisory opinion by this

21

Court, which this Court has recently done in the Westfall case

22

and which it has done in the past.

23

Three, again in the alternative, that the case be

24

remanded to trial in accordance with the opinions of this

25

Court.
4

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

5
1

We ask these in the alternative.

2

First of all, we contend that the petitioner's rights

3

to a jury verdict on both the Government contract defense and

4

on the Logan type defense was violated under the Seventh

5

Amendment.

6

Government contractor defense shouldn't even be in the trial

7

court level, every circuit that has adopted it has said it is a

8

jury verdict.

9

The reason being that if you consider that the

The Fourth Circuit —

QUESTION:

You mean a jury question?

10

MR. FRANECKE:

11

The Fourth Circuit, on the other hand, changed the

12

Government contractor defense from the trial court statement

13

and jury charge and gave its own version of it and then decided

14

the facts.

15

Constitutional right.

We contend that this is a violation of the

16

Yes, Justice?

17

QUESTION:

18
19

A jury question, that is correct.

It wouldn't be if the facts clearly could

produce only one result.
MR. FRANECKE:

In fact, the issue was very hotly

20

contested, as the Fourth Circuit said.

21

contend is exactly the point.

22

to hear the evidence, review the witnesses and make the

23

determination as to what facts in fact apply based on the law

24

as charged.

25

QUESTION:

Which of course we

The jury is in the best position

You'd acknowledge though that if the facts
5

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

6
1
i2

could produce only one verdict from a reasonable jury, then it
could be decided on the issue?

3

MR. FRANECKE:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. FRANECKE:

6

Absolutely, of course.

But you say that's not the case, here?
I say absolutely that is not the case.

Precisely.

7

Similarly, this begs the question of the Government

8

contractor defense in the first place.

Now, this Court of

9

course has heard a full hour of argument from both parties with

10

regard to the Government contractor defense and has asked for

11

reargument.
Petitioner contends, however, that Congress is in the

12
13

best position to consider the empirical evidence that is

14

necessary to determine whether even any form of a Government

15

contractor defense, if any, should be articulated by this Court

16

or articulated by Congress.

17

QUESTION:

Well, could the State of Virginia enact a

18

statute indicating specifications for helicopters and say that

19

violation of that statute was negligence and apply it in this

20

case?

21

MR. FRANECKE:

22

would ever do that.

23

QUESTION:

24
25

I would doubt very seriously if they

I didn't ask you whether they would.

I

said, could they?
MR. FRANECKE:

Heritage

Of course.
6
Reporting
(202)

I believe that they could.

Corporation

628-4888

7
1

However, I think it would then be reviewable.

2
3

QUESTION:

A state statute can control the

specifications for a Government helicopter?

V

4'

MR. FRANECKE:

I think there is an argument to be

5

made that yes, it could, because under the Federal Tort Claims

6

Act, Governmental activity is subject to state sovereignty, if

7

you will, or state law.

8

used in a state, then the state may enact statutes or

9

legislation which may cover that particular product, especially

10

So that if a product is in fact being

if it's a military product.
In fact, the Dorsey case in Florida already does make

11
12

the Government contractor defense or a form of it the law of

13

Florida.

14

QUESTION:

So your position is the State of Virginia

15

and every other state can pass statutes specifying safety

16

designs for military vehicles?

17

MR. FRANECKE:

If they so choose, I think they could.

18

I think they could.

Now, of course the question is, would

19

they, when Congress itself has not.

20

QUESTION:

This is a preemption question, isn't it?

21

MR. FRANECKE:

Exactly, of course.

And then there

22

would be the question of whether or not the supremacy clause

23

would or would not apply for a particular state's enunciation

24

or non-enunciation of a Government contractor defense.

25

QUESTION:

Well, and that question turns upon whether

Heritage

7
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

8

1

or not there would be inconvenience and disruption to the

2

Government design?

3

MR. FRANECKE:

Up to a point, yes.

I consider that

4

to be precisely the issue we are dealing with here.

And that

5

again begs the question, is Congress then in the best position

6

to make such a determination.

7

QUESTION:

Hasn't Congress made a determination in

8

the Tort Claims Act that if a state should pass such a statute,

9

it's pretty clear, is it not, that that statute could not be

10

applied to hold the Government liable for determination by the

11

Department of the Defense that a relatively unsafe helicopter,

12

given all the other factors that have to be considered in a

13

battle environment, is what it wants.

14
15
16

You couldn't sue the Government under the Federal
Torts Claims Act, right?
MR. FRANECKE:

It would be a discretionary decision.
I'm not so sure that that is correct.

17

You had asked in the previous argument in October about the

18

discretionary function, and of course, this is a detail of this

19

particular defense that we really haven't even gotten, at least

20

in the facts of the Boyle case.

21

I would say that if Congress has said that under the Federal

22

Tort Claims Act, that acts of the Governmental employees, save

23

for the discretionary act, are subject to state law, then state

24

law would in fact apply, unless of course this Court or some

25

other court determined it was a discretionary act.

But taking your hypothetical,

8

Heritage

1

QUESTION:

Well, let's assume, I mean just take that

2

as a given.

3

be, but if it were, don't you think it would be a peculiar

4

result if the consequence was you therefore could not sue the

5

United States Government, says Congress, but you can sue the

6

person from whom the Government bought the helicopter.

7

I understand you quarrel as to whether it would

MR. FRANECKE:

I think that would be a peculiar

8

result because I think Congress has already spoken that it

9

feels that the state law in fact should be applied if an

10

accident takes place in its own borders and even if it's

11

military, save of course for any action arising out of

12

combative activities of the Armed Forces during time of war

13

which is the only exception under the Federal Tort Claims Act.

,14

QUESTION:

.

Well, I'm not sure I understand your

15

answer.

16

discretionary function exemption of the Tort Claims Act, there

17

could neither be a suit about it against the United States nor

18

a suit against the seller to the United States on the Tort

19

theory?

20

You acknowledged that if it was within the

MR. FRANECKE:

If that were the articulation of the

21

law, yes.

However, the question is in fact there a

22

discretionary act on the part of a Government employee which we

23

contend the Government contractor defense is not a

24

discretionary act and should not fall within that exception.

25

And of course I'm prepared to go into that in more

detail.

In fact, as a point, I think I should raise that now

because we contend that Congress has a scheme of procurement of

5

relationship is, and the Executive Branch for that matter, what

6

its relationship is with the contractors who provide for profit

military or non-military equipment, all of the thousands and

8

millions of things that are bought by the Government.

This scheme has evolved over in essence 200

Congress is the one who has been setting forth what its

9

That scheme would be totally undermined by what the

10

respondents request as a Federal common law that says, we now

11

want a blanket tort defense to protect Government contractors.

And I might point out, we're not talking about just United

13

States contractors.

14

Governments, also.

the point.

Are we now going to start protecting foreign

contractors as well?

for a moment.

have a steering mechanism that meets exactly these

22

qualifications, and the state mandates something differently.

23

Helicopter crashes, suit in state court.

24
25

What happens if the Government says you shall

MR. FRANECKE:

All right.

Two things.

First of all,

certainly under the supremacy clause, it would sound as if
10

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

11

1

Congress' ruling would preempt.

2

laws on the books called the contract specification defense,

3

which is a matter of compulsion, if you will, to a contractor

4

to specifically and exactly comply with a particular

5

specification, unless they're so obviously defective —

6

QUESTION:

But secondly, we already have

But on the basic point that the Federal

7

statute or Congressional directive would control, that's really

8

the case here if the Executive acts pursuant to statutory

9

authority and prescribes a particular mechanism, is it not?

10
11
12
13
14

MR. FRANECKE:

Absolutely.

Absolutely, and I agree

with you, Justice Kennedy.
QUESTION:

Is there a basis for that preemption

argument in this case?
MR. FRANECKE:

There's a basis for the argument but

15

there is not an actual basis coming from Congress and from the

16

Executive Branch.

17

QUESTION:

Well, you're not saying that the

18

Government was not authorized to purchase and design the

19

helicopter, are you?

20

MR. FRANECKE:

No, not at all.

What I am saying is

21

after the fact of their purchase, the courts, specifically the

22

Eastern District of New York in the "Agent Orange" case

23

specifically then made up the Government contractor defense.

24

And it started being picked up by the various circuits and it

25

has now reached this Court.
11

Heritage

Corporation

628-4888

12

1

QUESTION:

I'm trying to explore the difference

2

between a specific Congressional authorization for a design and

3

what occurred here.

4

MR. FRANECKE:

What occurred here if you are asking

5

the factual underlying basis of this particular case is that in

6

this particular case there were basically two items of defect,

7

one of which had to do with an escape system which was supposed

8

to be used by the pilot or co-pilot, I should say, who

9

unfortunately was not able to use it, and we contended it was

10

defective, because the helicopter sank in the water and a

11

window which was supposed to be opened could not open because

12

it only opened out and water pressure held it in.

13

that that was a defect.

14

We contended

The second defect was that we contended that a servo,

15

which is a mechanism like the power steering on your car, went

16

awry and forced the helicopter into an uncontrolled maneuver

17

and it crashed.

18

QUESTION:

And my question is were those specified

19

and designed by the Government in cooperation with the

20

contractor?

21

MR. FRANECKE:

Here is the insidious aspect of the

22

Government contractor defense.

23

to the Government that it could be controlled under the worst

24

case malfunction.

25

be controlled under the worst case malfunction which it could

The servo was told by Sikorsky

In fact, they didn't know this servo could

12

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

13

1

not.

They only learned it after the fact when they did

2

testing.
The Government approved it, approved the statement

3
4

that this could be handled in a worst case malfunction.

5

then built and actually there was no knowledge one way or

6

another whether it could be controlled under the worst case

7

malfunction until after the accident in this case.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. FRANECKE:
QUESTION:

10

It was

But that's factual.
That's correct.

I simply want to establish whether or not

11

in your view, in a case where the Government purchases a

12

helicopter under a general statutory authorization, and designs

13

that helicopter, the state can impose inconsistent regulations?

14
15

MR. FRANECKE:

In contrary to the specification

itself?

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

17

MR. FRANECKE:

I don't think it could because again

18

if the Government is the one who is doing it unless there was a

19

suit under the Federal Tort Claims Act, that then it would be a

20

balance policy question which we contend Congress has to

21

balance as to whether or not Congress would subject its

22

specifications to state law or whether or not a supremacy

23

clause would overcome it.

24
25

I think that is the policy question we're dealing
with here.

There isn't an answer because of the nature of the
13

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

14
1

several different ways Congress has formulated various schemes

2

to buy products.

3

mimeographed 52,000 times a day, which is basically how many

4

products they buy, and that says the same thing.

5

different ways of buying different kinds of products.

It isn't one simple contract that is

They have

And yet this Government contractor defense is

6

7

supposed to be applied throughout.

That's why Congress has got

8

to look at the empirical evidence and decide whether or not it

9

wants to afford such a defense, in our view.

Because it isn't

10

a simple answer.

It isn't just a simple specification.

There

11

are many many different ways in which Congress either asks for

12

certain things to be built, or they buy them off the shelf, or

13

they buy them in combination with many different things.
It's not that simple and that's why I'm saying that

14
15

this Court unfortunately in our view is not equipped to

16

question military necessities, military needs, Congressional

17

necessities and Executive Branch implementations of those

18

necessities when dealing with this type of specifications and

19

products.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

Well, in Stencel Aero certainly that's a

judicially created doctrine of indemnity there.
MR. FRANECKE:

Yes, it is.

Under the Feres-Stencel

23

doctrine, there is a judicial created indemnity. We contend

24

that of course this may even be considered an extension of the

25

Feres-Stencel doctrine which we contend frankly we don't

Heritage

14
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

15

1

2

believe is appropriate.
QUESTION:

But it seems to me the parties in Stencel

3

could have made the same argument you're making here.

4

there's to be a right of indemnity here by the contractor, it

5

ought to be created by Congress.

6

accept that submission if it were made in the Stencel case.

7

MR. FRANECKE:

If

Obviously, this Court did not

I think however this goes much

8

further, because what you're dealing with here is not just a

9

single suit by a Government employee against the Government.

10

You're dealing with a say a Government employee or soldier past

11

the Government, the Government isn't involved, down into a

12

contractor who's a private citizen.

13

And under Feres-Stencel of course you're dealing

14

only, as I said, between the Government and the thing, and you

15

were talking in that case of course that it was incident to

16

military service, and that the Veterans' Benefit Act which has

17

no exclusion, this Court felt was an exclusion to any kind of a

18

suit against the Government.

19

Here, you're asked to go far beyond that down into

20

the private sector where manufacturers hold themselves out to

21

be experts in their field, design and manufacture products for

22

profit, sell them to the Government, and then are saying, oh,

23

no, we're not responsible because the Government said, oh,

24

we're buying it.

25

QUESTION:

I thought the contractor in Stencel was in
15

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

16

1

the private sector.
MR. FRANECKE:

2

He was but the case only turned on the

3

question of whether there was a suit against the Government, as

4

I understand it.

5

And that has seemed to have happened in all of the cases in the

6

past, especially when looking at, for instance, Westfall, which

7

you just decided in February of this year.

8

tort and the question of Governmental immunity where again you

9

looked at the balance between human life and what price is paid

The suit against Stencel was something else.

Talking about a

10

for that if you decide you want to offer an immunity for a

11

Government employee's discretionary act and within his duties.

12

And you in that case kicked it over to Congress.
And as you stated in that particular case, Congress

13
14

is in the best position to analyze the empirical data to

15

determine whether or not this should apply or not.
QUESTION:

16
17

preemption would afford this defense to the contractor.
MR. FRANECKE:

18
19

I thought you conceded that in some cases

Absolutely, if this defense is put in

place.
QUESTION:

20

No, I thought you conceded that under

21

existing law, the preemption type of defense should be

22

available to a private contractor in an appropriate case?
MR. FRANECKE:

23
24
25

Perhaps I was not answering exactly

that —
QUESTION:

I mean, you have to concede that because
16

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

17
1

that's simply hornbook preemption law, isn't it?
MR. FRANECKE:

2

The point is it's a

3

policy choice, which is what I was answering.

4

it is a policy choice that should not be made by this Court,

5

and it is possible —
QUESTION:

6

.

That's right.

We contend that

Well, are there any other areas in which

7

we say preemption is a policy choice and we're not going to

8

apply standard supremacy principles?
MR. FRANECKE:

9

No, no.

That's not what I mean.

What

10

I am saying, Justice Kennedy, is that certainly once the law is

11

on the books by Congress then it is for this Court to determine

12

both preemption and supremacy and to interpret of course

13

Congress' intent under the law.
What I am saying is that Congress doesn't want this

14
15

law and it only is coming up through the judiciary which is not

16

the right place for it to be coming from.

17

of saying, well, would supremacy in fact apply.

18

course, it would apply if it's on the books.

19

the books.

20

So your hypothetical
Yes, of

But it's not on

And I contend that it shouldn't be.
QUESTION:

Well, then we're back to where we started

21

from because it seems to me there is authority to design a

22

helicopter and to specify its characteristics.

23

MR. FRANECKE:

I absolutely agree and I think there's

24

no question that there is the authority to specify how a

25

helicopter should be built.

The question then is, if the
17

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

18
1

helicopter is defective, is the contractor in fact responsible

2

for the defect even though there's a specification which in

3

some cases might be very specific and in other cases may be

4

very vague.

5

has to determine that point because of so many variables.

6

And I am contending that Congress is the one that

For instance, the cost.

The helicopter that crashed

7

in this case cost several millions of dollars.

That helicopter

8

was a loss to the Federal Government and I am sure they were

9

not happy about it as such.

That cost override is a

10

Congressional determination as to whether or not it should put

11

the responsibility on the contractor or whether or not it

12

should absorb it and say, well, okay, you weren't responsible.

13

Even in the contract in this particular case, there

14

was a specific clause called the "design responsibility clause"

15

where the Government specifically said that it was not, the

16

Government was not responsible for the actual suitability of

17

the design of this particular helicopter, even though it set

18

forth specifications which were really requirements.

19

Sikorsky provided detailed specifications which said, this is

20

what the helicopter will do when we build it, which were then

21

approved by the Government.

And then

22

As I said, it is a very very thorny issue that would

23

in essence be a broad stroke national tort defense which would

24

then be filtering down and frankly probably provide tremendous

25

amounts of further litigation back and forth and back and forth

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP A. LACOVARA, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. LACOVARA:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court.
Before getting to the substance of the Federal

12

military contractor defense, which I believe is the principal

13

issue before the Court, I do want to take just a moment to

14

explain why there are really no other issues, procedural or

15

substantive, besides that.

19

Counsel has referred to Seventh Amendment jury trial
issues and absence of request for instructions.

Mr. Lacovara, let me interrupt.

Did we

The grant was not limited.

of the defense or its federal source, Petitioner's Seventh

2

Amendment claims as reiterated today ought not to distract the

3

Court.

4

First of all, as the Court of Appeals indicated in

5

its opinion, there were only two bases arguably available for

6

the jury verdict against Sikorsky.

7

negligence in repairing the servo which is the control

8

mechanism like power steering.

9

defective design of the escape system.

10

One was an alleged

The other was the alleged

It was that first issue, negligence in reworking or

overhauling that the Fourth Circuit said was simply not proved

12

sufficiently in accordance with Virginia law.

14

Appeals concerning the design of the servo.

15

There was no

Petitioner argues here that the Logan case which is

16

the case on which the Fourth Circuit relied in finding that

17

Virginia law on liability for negligence in repair had not been

18

satisfied, had not been argued at the trial court.

19

simply false.

20

394 of the trial transcript where counsel for Sikorsky moved

21

for a directed verdict expressly on the ground that Petitioner

22

had not borne his burden of proof under the Logan case as

23

established by the Virginia courts.

24
25

That is

The case was specifically referred to on page

And that's why, in going to the Court of Appeals, the
Petitioner expressly said that the issue before the Court was

Heritage

20
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

21
1

simply whether the military design of the helicopter had been

2

adequately approved by the Department of Defense.

3

QUESTION:

But the instructions on this point, and

4

the instructions included, as I understand it, a version of the

5

contractor defense, were approved by both parties, or at least

6

there was no objection by either party.

7

aren't you barred from arguing any differently here?

8
9

MR. LACOVARA:

So under Rule 51, why

We are not arguing differently.

We

indicated that we were satisfied with the instruction given at

1

the trial level.

11

colloquy with counsel a few minutes ago, the issue before the

12

Court of Appeals was not whether the law on the military

13

contractor defense ought to be different from the charge given

14

to the jury, but whether or not the facts as a matter of law

15

made out that defense.

16

And as Justice Scalia indicated in his

QUESTION:

But the Court of Appeals went far beyond

17

that and why not, how could it do so properly when the

18

instructions had been agreed on by both of the parties?

19

MR. LACOVARA:

I do need to interject at this point,

20

Justice Kennedy, that plaintiffs did object to the instruction.

21

Sikorsky announced that it was satisfied with the instruction

22

as given by the Fourth Circuit.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. LACOVARA:

25

Well, then that's even worse.
Well, it would be worse if we were

asking for a different rule of law in the Fourth Circuit, or if

Heritage

Reporting Corporation

22

1

the Fourth Circuit announced a different or more restrictive

2

rule of law, but that isn't true.

3

instructions, as you will see, required that Sikorsky prove

4

three things: that the Government had approved reasonably

5

precise specifications; that the helicopter had been built in

6

accordance with those specifications; and that Sikorsky did not

7

have superior knowledge to the Government's knowledge about any

8

defect.

The District Court's

That is exactly the instruction that was approved or the
rule of law that was adopted by the Fourth Circuit.
QUESTION:

Then this is just a sufficiency of the

evidence case?
MR. LACOVARA:

That's all it is from the Petitioner's

14

standpoint, that's correct.

15

properly being before the Court whether Sikorsky proved that

16

the military contractor defense had been satisfied under a

17

correct definition of the law.

It seems to me that's all either party's

entitled to argue about.

QUESTION:

MR. LACOVARA:

And that's all we are arguing about.

Sufficiency of the evidence?
No.

The Fourth Circuit ruled, and I

assume that this Court is not interested in reexamining that

issue, that the evidence as a matter of law made out each of

those three elements.

But how is anything

else properly before us?
MR. LACOVARA:

The Petitioner is arguing, I gather,

4

on the basis of his latest brief despite what seemed to have

5

been conceded as generally common ground at the opening part of

6

the argument, that there ought not even to be a military

contractor defense, at least it is not permissible for the

8

Federal courts to adopt such a defense.

QUESTION:

That we assume is an

Well, we're reviewing the Fourth Circuit.

11

Petitioner wins, the Fourth Circuit said the instructions

12

should be different, but you didn't ask for a different

13

instruction.

14

MR. LACOVARA:

The Fourth Circuit, sir, did not say

15

that the instructions should be different.

The Fourth Circuit

16

did not reverse and remand for a new trial.

It reversed and

17

remanded with instructions to dismiss the case, as has been

18

done because there was no stay, on the ground that the evidence

19

showed as a matter of law that Sikorsky had demonstrated all of

20

the elements necessary under the military contractor defense as

21

the district court improperly allowed the case to go to the

22

jury but as the record showed, the Fourth Circuit effectively

23

ruled that the motion for directed verdict and the motion for

QUESTION:

Well, I thought the way the case was

12

argued before that the issue before us was the existence of a

13

military contractor defense.

14

MR. LACOVARA:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. LACOVARA:

That is the issue that is framed.

And you say it isn't here?
The Petitioner's first question

17

presented is what ought to be the uniform definition of the

18

military contractor defense applied throughout the circuits.

19

And Petitioner conceded at oral argument in the first argument

20

at pages 11 to 12 that this is a matter of Federal law.

21

And what we are here we believe addressing is what

22

ought to be the contours of the military contractor defense.

QUESTION:

still talking about contours.

25

If he says the contours are zero, that's

the trial level, and I would refer the Court to record

3

references 45 and 46, that the Petitioner, Plaintiff, did

4

submit Government contractor defense jury instructions to the

5

trial court.

6

there is zero content to the defense.

7

you'll see in the original record, submitted four different

8

alternatives.

It is the case at

There was no contention at the trial level that
In fact, Petitioner, as

All of the cases cited by Plaintiff's counsel at the

10

trial court level to support its different versions of what the

11

Government contractor defense should be were Federal cases.

12

The existence of a military contractor defense did not surface

13

in this case until the case was ordered set for reargument, I

14

think it's fair to say.

15

appropriate, as counsel I think aptly recognized at the first

16

argument, that this is a matter that satisfies all of the

17

standards for determining an issue of defense as a matter of

18

Federal common law in accordance with the issues and tests that

19

this Court has evolved over the fifty years since Erie Railroad

20

against Tompkins.

21

22

And so I think it's appropriate to turn then to the
issue that we think is being —

24

the first argument?

Nor was there any question that it is

QUESTION:

1
2

The existence or vel non of the military

contract defense?
MR. LACOVARA:

3

I think not.

As we understood the

4

position, it was that the Shaw test adopted by the Eleventh

5

Circuit is the proper test.

6

petition seemed to be that there was a conflict in the Circuit.

7

That's what question one in the petition identified, what ought

8

to be the uniform standard.

9

circuits have identified with the Ninth Circuit's so-called

And indeed, the reason for the

Petitioners said most of the

10

McKay test which is the one applied here, and the Eleventh

11

Circuit has adopted the Shaw test which is fundamentally

12

different.

13

And we and the United States agree that the Shaw test

14

is inconsistent with the purposes for the defense.

15

the original argument was about.

16

QUESTION:

That's what

I thought the last part of the

Corporation

628-4888

27
QUESTION:

1

Why was it briefed if it wasn't here?

MR. LACOVARA:

2

Well, as we had indicated, the issue

3

of the existence of the military contractor defense had never

4

been raised in the lower Court.

5

whether that can be properly raised for the first time in this

6

case as contrasted with what was debated below, what are the

7

contours of the defense.
Now, I recognize, and despite our first footnote in.

8
9

And the issue therefore is

the Supplemental Brief on Reargument, that this Court is not

10

going to take the military contractor defense as a given if the

11

Court believes there is no Federal authority to recognize it.

12

Which is the reason that our Supplemental Brief on Reargument

13

goes in great detail in explaining not only what the elements

;4

of the defense are, but why it is a matter of supervening

15

national federal law.

16
17

QUESTION:

What is the source of the law?

Is it

something more than preemption?

18

MR. LACOVARA:

It is essentially preemption, yes.

19

That's the best analysis that we think to decide why this

20

defense exists as a matter of immunity, why it governs not only

21

the bulk of these cases which come up in Federal Court because

22

they involve matters where the claim itself arises under

23

Federal law, death on the high seas.

QUESTION:

Can we adopt it just to make preemption

It's just a mechanism to insure that the policy of

Heritage

,

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

28
1

preemption is followed?

2

MR. LACOVARA:

Well, putting it that way, Justice

3

Kennedy, makes it seem a bit more casual than I think it is.

4

As the presence of the United States rather graphically

5

illustrates, there are fundamental Governmental functions at

6

stake here in the way the Executive Branch and the Congress

7

discharge their constitutional functions to equip and direct

8

the Armed Forces.
They have gone about that pursuant to statutory

9
10

allocations of responsibilities in a way that involves a

11

partnership between the Defense Department and defense

12

contractors in providing the weapons of defense that the

13

Executive Branch and Congress believe are necessary.

14

simply an idle suggestion that we want symmetry in the law to

15

say that that decision not only controls a Federal court in

16

considering a liability claim or challenging a design decision,

17

but also binds state courts.

that would not be a revolutionary concept because the Yearsley

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. LACOVARA:

Indeed,

Well, how is this case somehow different?
This case is stronger because of what

7

we suggest to the Court are rather core areas of national

8

supremacy.

9

though Federal law may be the source of a decision, it may be

This Court has said in some circumstances that even

10

appropriate to adopt state rules of decision, that is, to allow

11

local policies to govern.

12

of that, where there is no reason why there needs to be

13

uniformity because the functions of Government are not really

14

at work or at risk.

Mire v. DeKalb County is an example

15

This is not that case.

16

QUESTION:

May I ask you a question about what you

17

mean by preemption.

You mean there is some Federal law that

18

commands the particular elements, the one, two, three, four

19

elements that are set forth in the Court of Appeals' opinion of

20

the military contractor defense?

21

MR. LACOVARA:

22

QUESTION:

Those elements —

One, that the United States is immune from

23

liability; two, it approved a reasonably precise specification;

24

three, the equipment conformed to the specification; and, four,

25

the supplier warned the United States about any danger that it

8

differently than one that includes those four elements?

What preempted what?

MR. LACOVARA:

9

But I'm asking you about
In other words, is there a

Yes.

Let me answer that question with a hypothetical that

10
11

I think is quite similar to the question Justice Kennedy

12

raised.

13

through its legislature had said, no company anywhere in the

14

country may manufacture and provide to the Department of

15

Defense a weapons system that the Defense Department orders

16

unless the Courts of Virginia are satisfied it's appropriately

17

designed and those courts may issue orders to prohibit or

18

restrain the delivery of such an inappropriately designed

19

product.

20
21
22
23

24
25

Let's assume for a minute that the State of Virginia

That is not, I suggest, a statute that this Court
would have much difficulty striking down.
QUESTION:

It's probably a statute that the Virginia

legislature won't enact, either.
MR. LACOVARA:

The Virginia legislature won't enact

it, I suspect, because they probably know what the supremacy
30

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

31
1

clause requires.
QUESTION:

2

If the United States wants to build it,

3

even if it is dangerous, the United States has the power to do

4

so.

5

MR. LACOVARA:

6

is at issue in this kind of case.

7

just as the Courts of the United States, -QUESTION:

8
9

And we are saying that is exactly what
The courts of the states,

Are you saying even if the United States

made a determination that the design was dangerous and said,

10

you have to take all the risk but just because we want it

11

manufactured that Virginia couldn't impose any liability for

12

its use?

13

MR. LACOVARA:

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

I absolutely concur in that.

So there's an absolute defense no matter

15

how negligent, no matter how willful or what, if I understand

16

you correctly, as long as the United States wants that

17

particular piece of equipment.

18

MR. LACOVARA:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

That is exactly right.

Even if the manufacturer knows, and even

if the United States did not know it would be dangerous.
MR. LACOVARA:

Oh, no.

that's the last element of

22

the test, Justice Stevens.

The essence of this defense is that

23

there is a determination being made by the Government that it

24

wants certain equipment designed in a certain way.

25

the test requires that the Government have approved reasonably
31

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

That's why

32
1

precise specifications.

2

however, as have all the courts, that if the contractor knows

3

about a hazard and the Government doesn't, then one cannot

4

attribute the decision to the Government.

5
6

7
8

9
10
11

QUESTION:

We and the United States agree,

Well, what if the manufacturer just

negligently fails to be aware of it?
MR. LACOVARA:

That's the debate between the Eleventh

Circuit and the Shaw test, and every other Circuit.
QUESTION:

Well, why is one preempted any less than

the other if the United States wants the item?
MR. LACOVARA:

The determination that distinguishes

12

whether there is to be preemption is whether or not it is fair

13

to treat it as the military department's decision.

14

military did not know, because a defect was concealed from it,

15

that a particular design had a latent hazard, which is not this

16

case of course, that would not then be fairly attributed to

17

design decision of the military department.

If the

19

Your opponent says that the origin of the defense

20

grew out of the Feres-Stencel case in 1977.

21

that's the source of the defense?

22

MR. LACOVARA:

No.

Do you agree that

We cite Feres and Stencel and

23

those related cases as showing in part this Court's function in

24

interpreting the scope of liability in the military context.

25

But our principal submission is that this is a separation of

2

commits to the legislature, Federal legislature and the

3

President, the responsibility for equipping and directing the

4

Armed Forces.

5

That is, the Constitution

6

Morgan fifteen years ago, it is not a proper judicial function

to supervise the training and weaponry.

8
9
10
11
12

QUESTION:

It is a proper judicial function to craft

the contours of the military contractor defense.
MR. LACOVARA:

Yes, that's where we get to the

Federal common law issue.
QUESTION:

Well, would that be true, Mr. Lacovara,

13

even if there were no discretionary function exemption in the

14

Federal Tort Claims Act?

15

MR. LACOVARA:

I think, yes.

If the Government is

16

making a decision, if the Department of Defense makes a

17

decision that it wants a helicopter designed in a certain way,

18

it ought not to make a difference to the contractor, or to the

19

courts, I would submit, whether or not the Government has a

20

discretionary function exception under the Tort Claims Act.

21

There is another issue which probably would lead to

22

the same result, and that is, is it the proper function of the

23

courts to reexamine that military decision which the Court I

24

think in Gilliqan against Morgan said it is not.

25

QUESTION:

I think your position would be the same if

Congress had never waived its sovereign immunity in the Federal

Tort Claims Act.

4

argument.
MR. LACOVARA:

5

6

The Government just was, period, just didn't

That's correct.

I think Gilliqan

against Morgan leads you to that same conclusion.
QUESTION:

7

Now, wait.

I really don't understand

8

that.

It seems to me you can make the argument that there

9

should be preemption if Congress wanted it, but how are we to

10

perceive that's what Congress wanted if in the Tort Claims Act,

11

Congress had said the Government itself should be liable for an

12

ill designed helicopter?

13

that Congress wanted to preempt liability of a private

14

contractor for an ill designed helicopter?

15

MR. LACOVARA:

Why would we have any reason to think

If Congress said it wanted the courts

16

to get into this question, you'd have a different issue.

17

Presumably, Congress could waive — could waive — the

18

political question doctrine invoked in Gilliqan against Morgan.

19

You then though, Justice Scalia, have the other issue

20

which is the Yearsley defense.

The contractor doing the

21

Government's bidding under established law in this Court and

22

everywhere else is not directly liable even if the principal is

23

liable for a negligent or improper decision.

answer the question in this case if Congress had said that,

which it assuredly has not.

Your preemption is based on the power of the Government to buy

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. AYER, ESQ.

10

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT

11
12
13

MR. AYER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.
It's generally agreed I think along the lines of the

14

questions being asked by Justice Kennedy earlier that a

15

contractor who is working from Government supplied

16

specifications and simply producing what the Government asks

17

for will not be liable for tort action under state law.

18

The issue here, —

19

QUESTION:

But you would agree, wouldn't you, that

20

the contractor could be liable for other responsibilities under

21

state law, such as paying taxes on his earnings.

22

MR. AYER:

Certainly.

23

QUESTION:

But the one thing the state can't do is

24
25

forbid the manufacture of what the Government wants?
MR. AYER:

Well, forbid or interfere.

QUESTION:

Well, what about tax?

Isn't that

interfering?
MR. AYER:

Well, I think it becomes a question of the

nature of the interference and how substantial it is.
QUESTION:

If employees get hurt in the course of

6

manufacturing the item, they have to pay workmen's

7

compensation.

8

for the use of the product?

9

Why is that different than the responsibility

MR. AYER:

Well, I think it's a matter of degree.

10

And I think our position is that these questions of immunity or

11

freedom from liability are questions that must be resolved as a

12

matter of Federal common law.

13

at least initially, and here I think we're at the initial

14

stages of defining and or recognizing this defense, we should

15

deal with the case that we have, and then work off later, if

16

it's relevant to other case that are more difficult.

17

are more difficult cases than this one.

18

QUESTION:

And that they are best resolved

But your common law argument as I

19

understand it is quite different from your colleague's

20

preemption argument?

21
22
23

MR. AYER:

And there

Well, if I may, I'd like to proceed and

explain why the Government is here in this case.
We think that the issue is the next logical step

24

beyond what I think most people take as a given, that is, that

25

when you are dealing with Government supplied specifications,
36

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

37

1

there's no liability.
The question here is whether that freedom from

2
3

liability is lost where a contractor is first working together

4

with the Government to produce the specifications and then once

5

they are arrived at and approved by the Government, goes

6

forward and builds the product.

7

QUESTION:

But it seems to me that Federal common law

8

and preemption, as Justice Stevens suggests, are quite

9

different.

Where do we get the authority to make up the law in

10

this area and not in any other area, if it's federal common

11

law?
MR. AYER:

12

Well, I don't agree, I guess, that they

13

are quite different.

14

have a basis to move in and define what the appropriate law

15

should be.

16

right word, and I don't disagree with its use, the preemption

17

comes from the lawful act of the Executive Branch pursuant to

18

legislative enactments in defining a particular product that

19

the Government wants.

20

The question is whether Federal courts

And I think the preemption, if preemption is the

It then has by those specifications preempted a

21

contrary state law claim in essence that you can't build this

22

product without being liable under state tort law.

23

think is the kind of preemption.

24

What is behind —

25

QUESTION:

That I

That's really not too different from

The Government issues a whole bunch

of checks.

4

states.

Because of that, it needs a general rule that will

5

MR. AYER:

I think that's exactly right, Your Honor.

6

QUESTION:

Would you characterize Clearfield Trust as

7
8
9

preemption?
MR. AYER:

Well, I wouldn't initially and I think you

can argue about whether it's preemption or not.

I would prefer

10

to talk about it in terms of an area of Federal common law.

11

think that's the way it's most usually thought of.

12

QUESTION:

13

state law does not.

14

MR. AYER:

That's correct.

15

QUESTION:

And if the state tries to do it, they

You're saying Federal law controls and the

16

cannot do it and you might put the preemption label on it.

17

It's just that Federal law controls.

18

MR. AYER:

That's right.

19

QUESTION:

What about a procurement of items that

20
21

I

That's exactly correct.

aren't according to a specification, an ordinary item?
MR. AYER:

An ordinary item that is not according to

22

a specification is not something that we think should be

23

covered by the defense.

24

ability of the United States and especially in the military

25

context, which is this case, to procure by an appropriate

of the Government and the contractor is critical in the area of

military high technology equipment.

The cooperative interaction

You simply cannot procure electronic counter measures

5

equipment or jet fighters by having a contractor punch out

6

those items with a cookie cutter provided by the Government in

the form of specifications.

without that kind of an interaction, we are not able to get the

Yes.

But Mr. Ayer how does that differ

12

from say sophisticated airline equipment of one kind or

another.

14

of loss if a mistake is made.

15

They generally don't say we'll just let the consumer bear the

16

risk.

17

You have a question of who is going to bear the risk

MR. AYER:

The parties negotiate it out.

The difference is in the concept of

mistake.

QUESTION:

But pilots are consumers of the military

aircraft, too.
MR. AYER:

Well, but the military are consumers of

military aircraft and I think therein lies the issue.

issue is, who shall define the appropriate standard of safety

in the military context.
QUESTION:

Safety in the military context —

You can phrase it that way or you should

ask who shall bear the risk of loss if somebody bungles.
MR. AYER:

Well, but I disagree with your

5

characterization of the word, bungling.

Because there are

6

choices to be made.

7

could produce a better ejection seat on a certain plane. But a

8

better ejection seat would mean that the plane would weigh

9

another 150 pounds.

There are choices in terms of yes, we

And another 150 pounds would mean that the

10

plane would fly ^0 miles an hour slower and to 100 miles an

11

hour less far.

12

where maybe there is a mission need to go from here to there,

13

is that you can't get there from here.

14

And the result of that in the military context

And the equipment which is maybe marvelously safe for

15

the operator is horrendously unsafe for the troops on the

16

ground and for the mission that it's designed to perform.

17

that judgment, it goes back to this Court's traditional

18

deference to military judgments in the context of war time and

19

the national defense.

20

So

It is necessary to leave those judgments to the

21

military because the military best knows what is, quote, safe,

22

given all of the issues that are involved, not simply the

23

question of operator safety.

24
25

QUESTION:

Does the Government's position depend at

all on the discretionary function exemption in the Federal Tort

Heritage

40
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

41
1

Claims Act?

2

MR. AYER:

Well, that's a hard question to answer.

3

And the reason why is that we feel as though this case with all

4

that is in it, including I think clear application of the

5

discretionary function clause, is the clearest case almost that

6

one can imagine for application of the defense.

7

that away, that would be one argument in support of recognizing

8

the defense here which would not be there.

9

answer is that it would be appropriate for this Court or

If you took

And frankly my

10

another court when that case came up to scratch its head and

11

say, should we or should we not extend the defense which has

12

been recognized in this case to that one.

13

I think my answer to you is, no, ultimately it should

14

not.

15

trying to do with this defense is protect the procurement

16

process, the procurement of military equipment in particular.

17

Because what we are trying to do, what we should be

QUESTION:

But for you to argue that this is

18

appropriate for the military but not say for the Forest Service

19

sounds to me very much like the kind of thing the legislature

20

ought to decide.

21

MR. AYER:

Well, —

22

QUESTION:

Unless you have a series of statutes you

24
25

want to point us to in the military procurement area.
MR. AYER:

attributed to me that it is not appropriate.

powers, etcetera.
MR. AYER:

It relies on an area of lawful Federal

activity and because it's the military and because it's

6

sophisticated weaponry, it's in an especially critical area of

7

Federal activity.

8

than the case of Forest Service equipment.

And I think no doubt this case is stronger

But some of the same arguments, the procurement

9
10

argument itself is there I think in a less emphatic form. I do

11

not believe that this is a case where one can easily say

12

categorically that the defense should apply in these areas and

13

not in those areas, but what is true is that this Court has

14

traditionally recognized Federal common law in the context

15

where, without it, there will be a significant interference and

16

a disruption of the ability of the Federal Government to

17

function.

18

You look at the Federal Employee Immunity issue, you

19

look at the Act of State Doctrine.

20

private parties were in litigation with each other, and yet the

21

interest of the functioning of the Federal Government caused

22

the Court to step in and say, —

23

QUESTION:

Both of those cases where

Well, in the Act of State doctrine, there

24

really is no state law that supervenes because the United

25

States acts as a sovereign in foreign affairs.
42

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

43
MR. AYER:

1

Well, but the real question was, I think,

2

whether the functioning of the Federal Government and the

3

functioning of the Executive Branch in the area of foreign

4

affairs must be recognized over the claims of a court.

5

think it is rather similar.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS S. FRANECKE, ESQ.

9

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

10
11

MR. FRANECKE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

12

I would like to clarify just a few points.

13

First of all, we do in fact of course challenge the

14

Government contractor defense because of the Court of Appeals.

15

Since the Respondents didn't challenge the Government

16

contractor defenses given by the jury charge at the trial

17

level, we didn't have any reason to brief it or to even argue

18

against what the Respondents had appealed to the Fourth

19

Circuit.

20

to the Petitioner as to what the Fourth Circuit did.

21

Which is why of course it was a sua sponte surprise

QUESTION:

Well, I would think you would have a

22

reason to challenge it if you thought there was no Government

23

contractor defense and the District Court had given your

24

instruction on the nature of that defense.

25

MR. FRANECKE:

True.

But we had won at the trial

43

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

44
1

level.

The jury had already said that the Respondent had not

2

met its burden of proof.

3

provided sufficient facts to overcome the Government contractor

4

defense as had been given by the jury charge.

All we were doing-was showing we had

5

So we didn't have to challenge it at that point.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. FRANECKE:

8

The second thing that I would also like to clarify is

9

Because you were the appellee.
Absolutely.

Absolutely.

is that while we have in our briefs, because this is the

first

10

time this Court has been faced with the Government contractor

11

defense, espoused a Shaw test as perhaps being one of the

12

better of the Government contractor defenses, this is only an

13

alternative argument on our part.

14

We are only saying this if this Court feels, in light

15

of all of the other arguments that have been made in our

16

and here before you now, that some form

17

contractor defense either should be advised to Congress as

18

being the thinking of the Court, or should be a part of the

19

decision in this case, we feel that the Shaw test at least

20

comes reasonably close to allow further cases to come up from

21

the lower levels to, let's say, examine the boundaries of this

22

particular new area of law.

23

briefs

of a Government

Now, under Clearfield Trust, for instance, obviously

24

we're talking about a check system having to do with Federal

25

Government.

But Westfall, which was recently decided, talked

3

the Tort system was also kicked to Congress.
There's a case on an antitrust having to do with

4
5

Texas Industries which also kicked it to Congress because of

6

the combinations of so many different factors that were

7

involved.
It is the Petitioner's position clearly that what

8

9

we're dealing with here are real people who get killed and

10

injured like the shuttle.

11

still just as apt.

12

smoke.

13

as seven lives.

14

I used that example before and it is

The shuttle went down in an orange puff of

A billion dollars went up in that puff of smoke as well

And Morton Thiokol was at fault.

And they are

15

getting another $500 million, I read in the paper, to redesign

16

the booster as well as the Government is also requiring another

17

billion dollars of taxpayers' money to be spent to build

18

another shuttle to replace the Challenger that went down.

19

And yet if the Government contractor defense is put

20

in place, Morton Thiokol will not be responsible in all

21

likelihood.

22

I think that is improper and I think at worst it is

23

Congress that should determine that balance that whole scheme

24

that the Constitution says is its purview and which it has

25

already spoken to in many other different indications under the

Heritage

Federal Tort Claims Act, under the Veterans Benefit Act, and

2

various other matters.

preemption.

And under even, for that matter,

Of course, if preemption were even an issue, I would

4
5

even cite the question, why don't we have a national law having

6

to do with automobiles.

7

yet we have individual states that provide the laws for those

particular accidents that may take place on a particular

highway.

We have a national interstate system,

it were put into place saying, well, the Government told us to
