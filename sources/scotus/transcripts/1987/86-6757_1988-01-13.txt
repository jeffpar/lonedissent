CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:
No. 86-6757, John Avery Coy v.

We’ll hear argument now in

Iowa.

Mr. Papak, you may

proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT BY PAUL PAPAK
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. PAPAK;
please the Court.
Clinton,

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

On November 13 of 1985 in the small town of

Iowa, twelve members of a criminal jury witnessed an

unprecedented and extraordinary event.
Following opening statements by the county prosecutor
and defense counsel, the court ordered the bailiff to turn off
the courtroom lights and to close the window blinds.

And with

that court thrust in near total darkness —

QUESTION:
MR. PAPAK:
QUESTION:
MR. PAPAK:

How large a town is Clinton?
Thirty-some thousand, Your Honor.
Small town?
Relatively small town.
Relatively small city.
Yes.

A large wooden structure, over six

feet tall and four feet wide, was dragged into the courtroom
past the members of the criminal jury and placed directly in
front of the Defendant at counsel table.
Then a panel of four spotlights, the only lights in

the courtroom, were turned on and focused directly on the
screening structure,

illuminating it and emphasizing it for

everyone in the courtroom.
Finally, two thirteen year old girls, one at a time,
were ushered into the courtroom through a special door to give
critical testimony as the state’s first and primary witnesses
against the Defendant, John flvery Coy.
QUESTION:
MR. PAPAK:
QUESTION:
MR. PAPAK:

Did they identify them?
They never identified him —
In what way then was it critical?
Their testimony was critical in, of

course, establishing that an assault did occur and in
identifying much of the circumstantial evidence that was used
or attempted to be used to tie in Mr. Coy to this particular
crime, Your Honor.
That the jury eventually convicted Mr. Coy despite
the paucity of incriminating evidence offered by the state is
not surprising.

Screening a defendant in the presence of the

jury made a guilty verdict all by inevitable.
Using a screening device in the presence of those
members of the jury signaled to each member of that jury that
this defendant was somehow different from each of them, that he
was a clear and present danger not only to these child
witnesses but to the children of the community generally, and
that he was undoubtedly guilty of the crime charged.

QUESTION:

What did the trial court judge instruct

the jury about this device and the reason for it?
MR. PftPftK;

He gave instruction, Your Honor, after

the first witness was called to the stand, and from the record
it is the only reference to instruction in the record:

"that

it’s quite obvious to the jury that there is a screening device
in the courtroom.
"The general assembly recently passed a law which
provides for this sort of procedure in cases involving
children.

Now I would caution you, and I would caution you

later, that you are to draw no inferences of any kind from the
presence of that screen."
Would you like me to go on, Your Honor?
QUESTION:

Well,

I would like you to comment on

whether it isn’t the case that kind of instruction to the jury
certainly takes away much of the thrust of what you say was the
inevitable consequence of use of the device.
MR. PftPftK:
O’Connor.

No,

I think it does not, Justice

I think, as the Supreme Court properly recognised,

when you are dealing with inherently prejudicial devices during
the course of a criminal trial, you simply can’t instruct away
the subconscious effect of singling out this particular person
in the courtroom for such obvious different treatment.
QUESTION:

I thought the people who were singled out

were the child witnesses, not the Defendant.
5

Heritage

<£0£> 6S8-4888

6

MR. PAPAK:

It wasn’t in fact, Your Honor, the child

witnesses who were singled out.

The device was placed directly

in front of the criminal Defendant at counsel table, and he was
the only person that was screened.

That is quite a bit

different from placing a screen in front of the witnesses as
they were testifying.
In fact, these children, Your Honor, could not see
this criminal Defendant, but they could see the judge sitting
in a black robe next to them on the right side, they could see
the twelve members of the jury at their left side, they could
see the media, the spectators, the bailiff, the court reporter,
defense counsel, the prosecutor, etc.
It was only this one person in the courtroom who,
according to the judge, needed this different treatment.
QUESTION:

I think this problem could be eliminated

if in the future the state puts the screen in front of the
child witness instead of in front of the defendant.
MR. PAPAK:

That would be one means, Justice Scalia,

I think, of lessening the prejudicial impact.

That doesn’t

resolve the problem in this particular context because the
court here made absolutely no finding nor was there any showing
that the use of a screen of this sort served any function in
this case.
QUESTION:

Counsel, what,

if anything, shows who,

anybody, asked for this?

7

MR. PAPAK:

The record shows that the county

prosecutor made an application seven days prior to trial for
closed-circuit television use of the child’s testimony, and
that while the children were out of the courtroom, the
Defendant be separated from them by a screen.
And then the court, on his own motion, said,

I’ll

deny the application for closed-circuit television, but I’ll
instruct the bailiff to place a screen in front of the
Defendant during trial, and that’s how the process occurred.
QUESTION:

When was the Defendant told about this?

I

mean, you said he made his request a week ahead of time.
MR. PAPAK:
QUESTION:
MR. PAPAK:

The county prosecutor did, yes.
Was the Defendant advised of that?
Yes, the Defendant received a copy of the

county attorney’s motion, and there was a hearing held, at
which time —
QUESTION:
MR. PAPAK:

Did he object or not?
Yes, he objected vigorously throughout

this trial on Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment grounds, and he
moved for a mistrial at all appropriate stages of the
proceedings to preserve his —
QUESTION:

What grounds did the prosecutor give for

moving?
MR. PAPAK:

There is absolutely, Your Honor,

in this

record, no ground of any sort given by the prosecutor or found

QUESTION:

Was the screen removed after they

completed their testirnony?
MR. PAPftK:

Yes, after the two thirteen year old

girls testified and for the remainder of the trial, the screen
was no longer in place.
QUESTION:
MR.

PftPPK:

QUESTION:

Were they the first witnesses?
First two witnesses for the state.
Mr. Papak,

if express findings had been

made by the trial court judge that it was necessary and
appropriate in this case, would you be here?
MR. PPlPPlK:
QUESTION:

Yes, we would still be here, Your Honor.
So that’s irrelevant, really, to your

argument.
MR. PPPOK:
QUESTION:

No,

it’s not —

You spend a lot of time talking about the

need for findings, but I’m not clear that that would solve it
in your view.
MR. PfiPflK:

No,

it would not solve it in this

particular instance, Your Honor, and I maintain that it would
not because the requirement before the state may infringe on
fundamental rights of a criminal defendant is not only a
showing of necessity, but a careful tailoring of the
infringement.

find it’s our position, Your Honor, that this
infringement was of such a gross nature and there are so many
less prejudicial ways of protecting the child witness from —
QUESTION:

Well, here the findings were in effect

made by the state legislature, weren’t they?
MR. PPPftK:

No,

I don’t think so, Your Honor.

The

state legislature did not make any findings because the statute
simply isn’t mandatory, nor does it on its face necessarily
apply just to criminal cases or just to victims.
Nor does it tell you which device should be used.
clearly,

It

I believe, vests discretion in the trial court to

determine in appropriate cases what the extent of the state
interest is and how it should best be met by some protective
device.
Here we have nothing by which we can judge the
exercise of that court’s discretion in simply saying,

I decide

we’re going to use this large and glaring screen in front of
the criminal defendant during the testimony of the two key
witnesses for the state.
QUESTION:

What difference does it make if it’s

glaring or not?
MR. PfiPflK:

I think it makes a lot of difference,

Your Honor, although it wouldn’t change its inherent prejudice.
It stood out to the jury emphasizing to them that something was
happening here that was very unusual, that we have a person

Heritage

10

here who must be so different and dangerous that we have to
screen him from the witnesses as they testify.
That’s a pretty powerful statement.

When we think

about Estelle v. Williams, where this Court found much
difficulty with the idea of having a criminal defendant testify
in court with "Harris County" along his chest or on his back or
the side of his pants, and the inherent prejudice that can be
drawn from the inferences of having a defendant dressed in jail
garb,

I submit that this is even a stronger prejudicial

inference.
It suggests that this defendant is dangerous not in a
general sense, but the children, to these two children and the
children in the community generally.
QUESTION:

find that —

He had already been indicted on these

charges of child molestation.
MR. PflPPlK:

That’s correct, Your Honor, and there is

no doubt that a criminal defendant seated at counsel table is
different from everyone else in the courtroom:

he is the

person indicted.
But this Court has taken great pains to prevent the
risk of somehow letting the jury make their deliberation based
on impermissible factors.
impermissible factor.

Plnd that screen was one great

It had, by its very nature, suggested

inferences about this person that made him much different from
everyone else in the courtroom.

QUESTION:

I guess the jury would say, well, there’s

a screen there and the only thing that is screened is the
witness’s view of the defendant.
MR. PfiPftK:
QUESTION:

The jury could see that.

That may be one inference.
What would the jury think — well, the

court doesn’t want the witnesses, these children, to see that
fellow?

Now if that’s the fact, what inferences do you think -

MR. PfiPftK:
Honor.

I think the inferences are clear, Your

What the jury is being told is that these children as

they are sitting in court are traumatised by testifying in
front of this one man.

find they are traumatized because he in

his very presence here in court has some harmful effect on
them, and that harmful effect was caused by the fact that he
committed some acts against them previously as their assailant
in the tent in the night of August 3,

1985, and therefore, he’s

guilty of the crime charged.
QUESTION:

But that isn’t what they were instructed.

The jury was told that this device was used because the state
law required it.
MR. PfiPftK:

First of all, Your Honor, that is not

what the state law states, and it is a misstatement of state
law if it’s what the judge said.
QUESTION:
MR. PfiPftK:

Well, that’s what they were told.
The judge said, provides for? he didn’t

say mandated.
all,

But assuming that the judge said that, first of

it would be a misstatement, but more importantly, I think,

is when we look at this Court’s reasoning in cases like Estelle
v. Williams.
We’re not saying that you eliminate all risk and it
must only be an inherently prejudicial risk, that we’re
concerned about, but we’re concerned about the variety of risks
that influence the jury’s deliberations, and while the jury
might have said, one inference that could be drawn from this
screen is something about a statute,

I think, the inevitable

inherently prejudicial influence of singling out this one man
for such different treatment in a darkened courtroom with this
big screen there has another subtle effect on that jury’s
deliberative process that may, as I suggested, make conviction
inevitable.
QUESTION:

Counsel,

is the colloquy between the judge

and the prosecuting attorney in this record?
MR. PfiPfiK:

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

MR. PAPAK:

Your Honor,

if I may respond to that.

In

Estelle v. Williams we had a criminal defendant seated in court
with jail issue clothing, and it said "Harris County Jail."
Now everyone in that courtroom including the jury knew that he
was the charged defendant.
QUESTION:

MR. PAPAK:

about it.
MR. PAPAK:
QUESTION:

All right.
Mr. Papak,

in Estelle. as I recall, the

Court saw no state purpose at all or state inference served by
the jail garb.

It is pure coincidence, really, that the guy

had it on.
MR. PAPAK:
QUESTION:

Convenience.
In here I’m sure that the state argues

there is a purpose served here which would distinguish it from
Estelle.

I think.
MR. PAPAK:

I argue that the need for an

I presume that what interest might be

there is no articulation of what that interest is.
find even if there was an articulated interest, there
are certainly much clearer,

less prejudicial ways of meeting

that interest without infringing —
QUESTION:

That’s a separate argument, that could

have been met in other ways that were less prejudicial in your
view.
MR. PfiPfiK:
QUESTION:

Yes.
But it seems to me your case is different

from Estelle in that there was no interest that this Court
thought was served by having the guy go to trial in prison
garb.

Here there are quite obviously some reasons why child

witnesses should be treated differently with respect to the
accused Defendant than other people.
MR. PfiPfiK:

That is absolutely correct, Your Honor.

Children witnesses on a case by case basis should be treated
differently.
QUESTION:

Why should it be on a case by case basis.

Why can’t the legislature say, as the Iowa legislature did,
that in the case of child witnesses,

if there is any problem

the court may use this procedure?
MR. PfiPfiK:

Because the court hasn’t, within the

context of the legislation, made a mandatory determination that
in all cases children are traumatised and need protective
devices.

QUESTION:

Why should it have to be mandatory?

Why

can’t they leave it up to the discretion of the trial judge
when it’s needed in his view?
MR. PAPAK:

That’s correct, and that’s what they did

in this case, but how are we capable of reviewing the
discretionary decision by the trial court if he doesn’t
articulate the basis and the factors that he considered in
making that decision.
QUESTION:

But all sorts of discretionary decisions

made in the criminal process at every stage — and I don’t
think we’ve ever said that every discretionary decision must be
supported by some articulated basis for it.
MR.

PAPAK:

This Court in the Globe Newspaper Company

case suggested that when we are dealing with child witnesses
and the potential trauma of courtroom testimony, that there is
a clear and easy method of determining on a case by case basis
whether we should infringe on First Amendment rights, rights of
access.
And that same statement, that same articulated
purpose is equally applicable to infringement on the rights to
a fair trial, as in this case.
QUESTION:
MR. PAPAK:

Why?
Because this Court has routinely and

consistently —

Has this Court ever applied the need for

MR. PAPAK:

No,

it has not.

Not in this context it

The rights to a fair trial encompass,

inevitably, the

Pnd this Court has

indicated in Holbrook v, Flynn that when you challenge a
courtroom arrangement as inherently prejudicial, the important
question that must be asked is whether there is a risk that
practice would have some impermissible effect in the jury’s
deliberations.
The use of a screen in this case had quite that same
effect.

It has an impermissible influence in the jury’s

deliberations.
QUESTION:

Do you think this is a more serious

affront to constitutional rights than Holbrook, was?
MR. PAPAK:
QUESTION:
MR. PAPAK:

Yes, by far, Your Honor.
In what respect?
I think that in Holbrook this Court found

that there were many inferences, many of which were not
incrirninatory, that could be taken by the jury from the use of
armed guards in the courtroom.
QUESTION:

Uniformed storm troopers almost, with

weapons apparent.

It was made pretty strenuously.

That’s correct, Your Honor.

But this Court found that a

much broader range of inferences could be drawn about other
needs for security, considering that there were people who had
not been arrested as part of the conspiracy in that case, and
that the inferences would not have to be drawn relating only to
the defendant in that case.
The screen in this case, the inferences that can be
drawn from this screen relate only to Mr. Coy as he sat at
defense counsel, because the screen was placed only in front of
him and shielded only his view from that of the witnesses.

its face, but it hasn’t been so interpreted by the Iowa Supreme
Court.

so-called rights by having a trial outside the courtroom?
QUESTION:

Yes, you’re right, Your Honor.

There is

an inevitable tension here in this argument between the rights
of confrontation and the rights of due process.

But I think

when you’re dealing with due process and the presumption of
innocence, you’re dealing with the bedrock of due process
rights, rights that should only be infringed upon in the most
unusua1 circurnstances.
Confrontation has always been considered by this
Court a more flexible trial right.
QUESTION:

You would have been happy with a videotape

outside the courtroom?
MR.

PPlPPlK:

Pi videotape would not have had the same

prejudicial impact.

There still would have to be a finding —

QUESTION:

Would you be content with it is what I am

asking.
MR. PftPPlK:

If there was a showing that it was

It still infringes on fundamental

rights, there still needs to be some showing that it’s
necessary, not just a class based showing that somehow all
children deserve protective devices.

There are a

more appropriate for videotaped testimony.

television some courts have kept the defendant in the courtroom
watching the monitor along with the jury.
QUESTION:

Ore you abandoning your Sixth Amendment

QUESTION:

No,

I’m not.

Or are you just addressing the Due Process

MR. PAPAK:

No,

I’m not abandoning my Sixth Amendment

QUESTION:

Do you think it would not offend the Sixth

Amendment to put him behind a one way mirror?
MR. PAPAK:

No, what I said, Your Honor,

Sixth Amendment is more flexible,

is that the

I believe, than the

Fourteenth Amendment in terms of the necessity for
infringement.

There still is a requirement of showing that

some essential state interest in this case would be served by
infringing on Sixth Amendment rights.
And yes, a screen in or out of the courtroom would
infringe upon a defendant’s rights to confront adverse
witnesses.

I’m simply saying, on the balance it’s easier and

it’s fairer to do it outside the courtroom and infringe upon
Sixth Amendment rights.

QUESTION:

So defense counsel never said the biggest

trouble with screen is I can’t ask these girls if they can

No, the defense counsel said the biggest

trouble with this screen is that the jury is going to look at
it and say that man is obviously guilty and we ought to put him
someplace where he can be screened permanently —

By this appeal Appellant is not suggesting that
protective devices used to prevent potential trauma to child
witnesses are always inappropriate.

In some circumstances

children are certainly traumatized, and if they are traumatized
it is the responsibi1ity of the courts and the legislatures to
provide them sufficient protection.
However, by reversing the Iowa Supreme Court, this
Court will not be, as amicus suggests, crippling some
nationwide effort to protect child witnesses.

We are not

suggesting that you can’t use appropriate measures to protect a
child witness.

All we are asking is that before they are used

they are shown to be necessary.
I would like to reserve the rest of my time for
rebuttal, Your Honor.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, Mr. Papak.

We’ll hear now from you, Mr. Allen.
ORAL ARGUMENT BY GORDON E. ALLEN
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE
MR. ALLEN:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Justice, and may it please the Court.

Mr. Chief

John Coy has quite

simply failed to carry his burden of proof on his challenge to
the Iowa statute.

The record he has presented here today fails

to present a constitutionally significant issue, for it
involves only the exercise of judicial discretion, and in this

case a legislatively suggested exercise, to control the manner
in which the evidence was presented to the jury.
Our position, succinctly stated,

is that because the

one way mirror was not in itself inherently prejudicial,

it’s

limited use in this case presented an acceptable risk and
therefore did not deprive the Defendant of Due Process.
Secondly, Defendant offered no rebuttal whatsoever to
the rebuttable presumption created by the Iowa statute that
trauma to these children to testify as witnesses was the norm
and not the exception.
QUESTION:

Mr. Pi lien,

is correct, as I get from the

Iowa is the only state with this kind of a statute?
MR. ALLEN:

It is the only statute that I know of

that specifically provides for the use of a one way screen in
the courtroom, yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Do you know what brought it about in Iowa?

Was there some particular trial or case that lead to this
legislative action?
MR. ALLEN:

The statute itself was the result of a

nationwide effort by the witness protection organization that
went around.

And the reason that there are so many of these

statutes coming up at similar times is because of this
nationwide effort.
Primarily, the use —

MR. PAPAK:
adopted.

No, the closed-circuit t.v. was also

It’s in the same statute.

The one way mirror

provision in the statute was probably in relation or response
to State v. Strable. which was an Iowa Supreme Court case which
occurred two years prior to the passage of this statute,
whereby the Iowa Supreme Court upheld the action of a judge in
exercising his own discretion to place a chalkboard in front of
the defendant only while child victims testified.
Similar to the one way mirror, but with the exception
that the chalkboards could not be seen through either way, as
opposed to the one way mirror.

In this case, the children

could see the defendant.
At the trial, John Coy at no time presented any
suggestion that these children would not suffer trauma be
testifying.

He at no time suggested that their testimony would

be any different if the one way mirror were removed, and he at
no time suggested that the evidence was insufficient.
He suggested that it is not overwhelming, but he at
no time suggested that it would be insufficient.

He simply did

not provide anything other than a bald constitutional assertion
that his rights had been violated —
QUESTION:

Mr. Allen, can’t you make precisely the

same argument the other way?

The state hasn’t offered a bit of

evidence that the child witnesses would be traumatized.

There

is nothing in their testimony to suggest any fear on their

MR. ALLEN:

I differ with that, Your Honor, and for

the precise reason that you asked the question of counsel.

I

believe that there are several ways that presumption arises.
It arises from the findings of the legislature contained within
the statement of purpose.
QUESTION:

If you say there is a presumption in every

case by reason of the legislature’s action.

The specific factors that Mr. Papak

suggests to this Court that should be looked at can be gleaned
from the record.

the suppression hearings, because he reviewed the depositions,
and because he attended the trial proceedings —

MR. ALLEN:

He had seen the children at the time of

the trial, but he knew their ages.

MR. ALLEN:

Correct, but he knew prior to that time

that he knew their ages, he knew their psychological maturity -

QUESTION:

What does that mean?

He knew they were

thirteen years old.
MR. ALLEN:

He knew they were thirteen years old and

that they were relatively mature for thirteen year olds.

These

were not thirteen year olds who could march into trial and
bald-facedly accuse anyone sitting there.
QUESTION:

How do you know that?

What is the

evidence of that?
MR. ALLEN:

He could glean that from the record.

QUESTION:

Where?

QUESTION:

Where?

that proposition?

What in the record would support

Did they have any evidence of any kind, or

is it just the fact that they’re thirteen?
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:

There is no evidence to the contrary.
Your argument is they haven’t put in any

evidence of absence of trauma, and all I’m suggesting is you
haven’t put in any evidence of trauma.

You rely entirely on

the fact that the state legislature says that this procedure
may be used when a child testifies.
It doesn’t say it must be used.

said it may be used if the trial judge so decides.

The legislature made a statement of

And he went with — primarily

because of the Sixth Amendment objection this defendant made,
we’re not going to use closed-circuit, we’re going to use the

QUESTION:

Well, apparently the judge thought he had

to do one or the other.
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:

I don’t agree.

I think —

His instruction reads a little that way,

doesn’t it?
MR. ALLEN:

I have to concede that his instruction

reads a little that way.
QUESTION:

I think —

Yes, and when he was talking about the

eyewitness identification he said, yes, there is a real problem
about that.

Maybe the legislature didn’t even think of this,

but nevertheless, he seemed to say he had to do it.
MR. ALLEN:

I think the instruction goes along with

the reason behind what the judge was doing.

Rather than

consider it mandatory and thereby give that instruction, the
instruction was consistent with the multiple inferences that
can be used or gleaned from the use of this one way screen.
The instruction was consistent with the inference
from the jury that it was the witnesses that we were
protecting, not the defendant, and the jury was specifically
instructed.

Only the conduct of the defendant, which went

against that interest, when the defendant stood up and objected
to the use of the screen, but never asked that it be removed,

in statutory rape, what we do is we reasonably put the burden

Children witnesses are not new, nor are crimes

against children new.

The same factor that causes a child to

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

37

be traumatised may also prevent a child who may have some
malicious reason for lying about a defendant from lying.
It has been believed that standing fact to face with
someone who is about to send you to jail deters lying, and that
certainly is what the Sixth Amendment seems to express.

It

doesn’t say you can use screens.
It says in all criminal prosecutions the accused
shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses
against him.

find confront means, according to an 1828

dictionary, to stand face to face in full view.
Now what has changed since then?

not know about the tenderness of children when the Bill of
Rights was adopted and we’ve suddenly discovered it now?
MR. fiLLEN:

I don’t believe that the face to face statement

usage of that word in the Sixth Amendment means eye to eye.

That’s what confront means.
These children did stand face to face

with the Defendant in front of the jury so that the jury could
in fact view their demeanor while —
QUESTION:

The whole purpose of it was to prevent

that could happen from that is that they’ll be traumatized or
terrorized and for that reason won’t tell the truth.
37
Heritage

Reporting

But another thing that can happen is that they’ll be
shamed into telling the truth rather than lying.

That’s

certainly the theory of the confrontation clause.
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:

It’s one theory.
It’s why they use the word confront.

They

could have said right to cross examine if that’s all they
meant.

They believed there was something valuable in being

able to confront your accuser, and you’re telling us that the
state can simply say, well, we’ve decided that you don’t have
to do that when it’s a child offense.
You can go to jail just as well for a child offense,
it’s just as much a criminal prosecution.
MR. ALLEN:

I don’t see —

This Court has historically said that

confrontation includes the right to have an oath, the right to
be in front of a jury, the right to know the demeanor, and the
right to have unlimited cross examination.

of his record,

I believe, to corne to this Court as he has this

morning and said there is never an instance when a one way
mirror can be used in the courtroom.
I would suggest that under the statute and under the
facts and under contemplation, there are instances that we can
conceive of when the one way mirror could be used in the
courtroom consistent with Due Process if there were an
essential evidentiary showing that Mr. Papak suggests we need.
So he is now forced down to the position of saying I
need this hearing.

What is this hearing going to consist of?

And that’s really the concern and the justification for finding
that the statute is a rebuttable presumption.
Because the hearing that Mr. Papak requests will be
of either two kinds.

It will be one, a pro forma, routinized

kind of version where the father comes in and says, my daughter
is traumatized and the judge says, fine, we’ll use a one way
mirror.
Or it will be the other end of the spectrum where we
will put these little girls through three days of psychiatric
counseling.

We will then have a battle of experts where the

Defendant will bring a psychiatrist and will bring a

MR.
you do not,

ALLEN:

No,

you don’t,

and our interest is that

because if that is the kind of hearing that Mr.

Papak. suggests,

that will necessarily preclude the use of these

alternative devices in most cases in small towns or small
cities of Iowa simply because the expense to both the victim
and the expense to the state will limit it to the most
egregious kinds of cases.
The limited kinds of cases,

those that have gone over

the years without prosecution because of the reluctance of
these victims to come to court and testify without the
alternative procedures,

those kinds of cases will again go

under the rug.
They will again not be prosecuted either because the
county attorney doesn’t want to put the child through the
emotional abuse,

or else because the child does not herself or

himself want to come to court to testify.

The short answer is that for the 85 year

old who is scared to death to testify,

I believe the one way

mirror is permissable, but I would differentiate in this
regard.
I think the age differentiation should in the first
instance be made by the legislature.

As the appendix of the

American Bar Association brief says, they have been all over
the board in this statute.

There are twelve to eighteen to

whatever.
Then I think the rebuttable presumption, that is that
trauma is the norm, should be applied to those under the age
level that the legislature has chosen.
QUESTION:

Or a 55 year old.

In this case children.
What about a 55 year

old?
MR. ALLEN:

I think, a 55 year old could use the

screen, but at their request.
QUESTION:

So all you have to say is I will be

traumatized by confronting the person I am accusing, and that’s

all it takes to say, that’s okay then,

if you’ll be traumatized

by confronting the person you are accusing, you don’t have to
confront them.

That’s not much of a constitutional guarantee

it seems to me.
MR. ALLEN:

That is not what I’m saying.

What I am

saying is that the proof, the burden must then be on the
requester if they are over the age that the legislature has
chosen.

There is no longer a rebuttable presumption, and in

fact —
QUESTION:

No,

I am assuming that I can prove it.

I

will really be traumatized by confronting the person I am
accusing, the reason being I am lying? I am sending him to
jail.
MR. ALLEN:

Then we are back, to d i f ferent iat ing again

on the definition of confrontation, and I don’t think that
there is any case that this Court has said that eyeballing
someone or forcing a glare on someone is contained within the
confrontation clause.
QUESTION:

I don’t think there’s any case we’ve

decided that says that any instance in which a witness has to
be present in a courtroom, he can be present in that courtroom
without confronting, that is being eye to eye with the
defendant.

Do you know of any case where we have allowed that?
MR. ALLEN:

I know of several where we have not, and

to use your carrying the argument on further, can that be used

47

offensively.

For instance, can the witness suggest that I no

longer want to look at the defendant and look to the other side
of the courtroom.
Can the defendant ask the judge to force that witness
to look them in the eye?
QUESTION:

Probably not, but if he looks away like

that the jury can draw some conclusions from that.

That jury

can say, ah, this witness does not want to confront the person
he accusing.
MR. ALLEN:

I think if the judge cannot compel that

witness to look at the defendant under the Sixth Amendment,
then I think the Sixth Amendment does not contain an eye to eye
confrontation requirement.

It contains a face to face in front

of the jury, where the jury has the opportunity to observe the
demeanor.
QUESTION:
MR. ALLEN:

All right,

I’ll say face to face.

I think these witnesses, this defendant

were given face to face confrontation.

They were given every

essential element of the Sixth Amendment.
QUESTION:
MR. ALLEN:

He saw her face, she didn’t see his face.
She didn’t see his, but the jury saw

bot h.
QUESTION:

Of course, all this argument overlooks the

obvious fact that some prosecutor or defense counsel and some
witnesses are blind, and yet it doesn’t cause us a great deal

Herit age

Report ing

of trouble.

There is no eyeball to eyeball confrontat ion

there.
MR. ALLEN:

That was raised by one of the amicus,

that a blind defendant would have a tough time with face to
face confrontation if it were taken to its logical conclusion.
As I was saying,

I would suggest that this is not the

case for this Court to make a balancing of interest between the
two prongs of the interest.

That is, the interest of the

defendant in confrontation and due process, and the interest of
the state essentially in protecting the interest of these child
victims so that they can come to court and testify.
I believe that this case can be decided simply
because the use of this one way mirror is not inherently
prejudicial and therefore no constitutional issue presents
itself.
If it is inherently prejudicial I think the essential
state interest was shown by the rebuttable presumption
contained within the statute which the Defendant took extreme
pains —
QUESTION:

It seems to be a Due Process problem if

there is a problem at all.
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:
beside the point.

If there is a problem at allBecause the confrontation clause is just

Whether there is any trauma or

not.
MR. ALLEN:

Sixth Amendment are provided, yes.

Trauma or not.

QUESTION:

Yes, and that the defendant can see the

MR. ALLEN:

So that in the language of California v.

Green, so that the circumstances closely approximate a trial.
QUESTION:

So that just leaves the question of

prejudice from the way they do it.
MR. ALLEN:

I would say that’s correct.

Although the

Sixth Amendment was utilized by this Defendant at the trial and
in his appeal to the Supreme Court as the primary thrust of his
argument, he now comes to this Court and his primary thrust is
Due Process, and I would agree that that is the primary issue
before us.

When did these two young girls identify

this man?

They did not, Your Honor, and that leads

He was masked during the altercation, and they were

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

Mr. Alien, one part of their testimony

really was quite critical for identification purposes, wasn’t
it?

He was wearing his watch in a particular way?
MR. fiLLEN:

Circumstantially identifiable, yes.

Heritage

He

was wearing his watch in a certain way, he made a statement
when he entered the tent which indicated that he had been
watching them that afternoon.

Yes, there was some critical

circumstantial identification.
QUESTION:

I mean, part of their testimony was

critical in hooking up the Defendant to this particular
incident.
MR. ALLEN:

And in the identification of the items

which were found in his house.
The third point I would like to suggest is that under
Estelle. this Defendant had the opportunity and as offered to
him by the judge, the reasoned opportunity, that he could upon
his request have that one way mirror removed.
He stood up in front of the jury and called attention
to the jury to the one way mirror contrary to the attempts that
the judge had made in order to say that this one way mirror
reflects more on the victims than it does on the Defendant.
The Defendant stood up and said, oh, that’s not true.
It reflects upon me because it’s against my constitutional
rights.

But the Defendant never then took the next step and

said, after cross examining the witnesses as he did, can you
identify your attacker, and they said, no, he was wearing a
mask.
Then the defense attorney never took that next
logical step and said, well, we’ll remove the one way mirror.

MR. ALLEN:

The judge offered him that opportunity.
The judge said he could do that?
The judge said,

if we have an

identification question, obviously we are going to have a
problem under this statute, and he in fact told the jury that
the one way mirror might have to be removed.
QUESTION:

I didn’t interpret that to mean if we had

an identification question that the defense itself chose to
raise in the fashion you’ve just said.

None in this Court.

Exactly.

its basic purpose of finding out the truth is

advanced by face to face, that some people will,

in fact, be

induced to be more truthful, to give more honest and complete
testimony by a face to face confrontation.
find so when we can, we require it.

When we can’t,

when some children can’t tolerate that, then fine, then it’s
appropriate then to infringe on that right.

Simply not shown

in this case.
fill we ask is that the judge articulate what the
necessity is, why the children were so traumatized that they
couldn’t give complete or accurate testimony and that he
consider the alternate measures of protecting those child
witnesses in the least intrusive method possible.
