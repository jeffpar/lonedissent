22

those services directly."
The facts which gave rise to this case may be stated

MR. RUBIN:

Between these parties?

that it is possible that he could — these children have been

history.

He was involved in certain acts of misconduct —

he was --

MR. RUBIN:

8

How old was he at the time?

John Doe?
— John Doe was, 17 years old, he was 6

feet tall and he weighed 195 pounds.

9

QUESTION:

And the other one?

..

10

MR. RUBIN:

The other one was 13 years old.

11

Now, with respect to Jack Smith, the Intervenor, he

12

had a series of acts of misconduct, and among those was —

13

were, stealing and a more serious incident where he grabbed

14

another child up by the neck, pulled him into a bathroom, asked

15

him for his money, took his wallet and took all the money that

16

the child had, some six dollars.
So we have children here, presented by the facts

here, who may reasonably be perceived to be "dangerous

Petitioner here is not in agreement with all the actions taken

by the school district.

sequence that we believe should be followed in California.

I think we have got to decide how to handle this case

by looking at the intent of Congress.

most important guide.

But we do have some clues.

We know, for example, that Congress was heavily

3

influenced by the Mills case and the Parks case, two district

court decisions.

said something that we

think is directly on point here:

Mills, the court said,

"pending the hearing and in receipt of

In such exceptional cases, the principal shall be

Now that is in Mills.

A comparable statement was made —

QUESTION:

Mr. Rubin, with reference to that

statement, is a "suspension" a "change in educational

18

placement?"

19

suspended for a week for some infraction, is he no longer in

20

the 8th grade?

21
22
23

MR. RUBIN:

The consensus seems to be that 10 days —

the 9th Circuit said 20 days here — a suspension would in
effect become a change in placement.

1

Well, a short suspension, during which

you are trying to figure out what to do with the child,

certainly would not be a change in placement, whether it is ten

4

days or twenty days, I would have to say 20 days, I think,

referred to 30 days, not 20 days?

2

likely to repeat that conduct.
QUESTION:

3

Well, there is a problem with the "stay-

4

put provision," which does appear to indicate that Congress

5

thought that a child should stay put, pending following the

6

procedural provisions in the statute.

7
8

Now, if we were to say somehow there was a
"dangerousness" exception, a school district could certainly
evade the procedural protections envisioned by .the statute by

10

labelling a child "dangerous."

11

MR. RUBIN:

Your Honor, first, I think we can look at

12

this as not really -- an exception to the statute.

We think

13

that it is implicit in the statute.

14

example, said that, "Implicit in this statute was the notion

15

that, when a handicapped child receives benefits, that there

16

will be some substantial benefit to that education."

This Court in Rowley, for

And the Court used the word "implicit" in the

17
18

statute.

1

that Congress is saying, "We do not intend to strip away from

20

school districts their traditional authority and

21

responsibilities to guarantee the safety in the school -- "

22

We think "implicit" in this statute is the notion

QUESTION:

Call it what you will, you want us to read

23

something into the statute that is not expressly there, and

24

that would appear at least on the face of it to read in an

25

exception that would be at tension with the statute.

12

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

The Solicitor-General makes quite a different

1
2

proposal to us than yours.

3

Solicitor-General's approach?

4

MR. RUBIN:

Do you want to comment on the

Your Honor, I believe the Solicitor-

5

General's approach, which I hesitate to characterize for him,

6

is an alternative which — has some merit to it, that is, you

7

can give the district court the ability to weigh these matters

8

as ordinary injunctive matters and balance equities and

9

irreparable injury, et -cetera.

10

That is a possible approach.

But permit me, if you will, to precede to my second

11

issue, which is the question of whether in an individual case,

12

the state must provide direct services to a child?

13

The Ninth Circuit says that, "where the local

14

educational agency is unable^ or unwilling to provide services

15

to one child, to any individual child, the state must step in

16

and provide those services."

17

to the language of the statute, which speaks in terms of

18

"children residing in the area;” which talks about "programs."

19

This is repeated in C.F.R. Section 300.360, where they talk

20

about "children in the area served."

21

meant this:

22

And we believe that is contrary

We think that Congress

Local school districts are on the front line.

They

23

give these services, and where you have children who can be

24

served only in a regional center like a school for the deaf or

25

a school for the blind, that is when the state steps in.

Heritage

13
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

Or

1

where you have a small district that does not have a program in

2

its district whatever for handicapped children.

3

unwilling to set out a program for its district as a whole,

4

then the state steps in.

5

Or it is
*

Otherwise you have got the complaint procedures in

6

1415, where the child or its representative, files the

7

Complaint and goes through those procedures which are designed

8

to protect him and gets the services to which he is entitled.

9

And upon the completion of those procedures, 1 if it

10

ever goes to a district court, the district court has a fully

11

developed record and can make an intelligent choice.

12

So, we think that in both these — on both these

13

issues, we are implementing the intent of Congress.

14

first issue it is implicit that Congress could not have meant

15

to take form school authorities the responsibility to guarantee

16

a safe classroom and a safe environment.

17

issue, that the scheme is such that the state provides direct

18

services only when a local district acts in the manner which we

19

have indicated.

Primarily for the reasons stated by Petitioner, the

United States agrees that the court below misconstrued the

"stay-put" in the direct services provisions.

4

Even if Petitioner is wrong, we submit that the

5

answer can only be because the courts below erred on a remedy

6

that they issued as relief for the asserted violations.

7
8
•*-r 9

This Court in Burlington said,

"in devising a remedy

for a violation of the EHA, a court should always keep in mind
the 'principle overriding the objective of -the EHA, which is the

10

provision of free appropriate public education in the least-

objective of the mainstream environment than would be the case

3

if the "stay-put" exception were not so rigidly applied as it

A similar point can be made with respect to the

6

direct services provision.

The child's IEP is determined on

7

the local level.

8

principal number of cases, the least restrictive environment

9

will be on the local level. If fhe local agency defaults, the

10

appropriate remedy is to order the local education agency who

11

did the IEP and has the direct services available, to provide

12

them.

More often than not — indeed, in the

The state acts in a supervisory capacity and should

be held to order the local education agencies to provide those

services, but the appropriate guns placed to the local

Let me move to each point in a little bit more

detail:

this Court has said on numerous occasions that

19

equitable relief, such as injunctive relief and declaratory

20

relief, should not issue as a matter of course.

recognized that Congress can and sometimes does, restrict a

22

court's equitable discretion, but it had said, given the

there are no such explicit words to be found in the EHA.
Specifically we would refer the Court to 20 U.S.C.

3

1415(e)(2), which is the remedial provision of the statute.

4

That is the section of the statute which says that "A court may

5

order any appropriate relief."

of discretion to courts.

18

That is part of our point —

We believe that their

Our point is simply that, when you have a dangerous

19

child, Congress did not remove the discretion of the federal

20

courts to allow the school to safeguard the interests of the

21

other children in the classroom, and certainly would not have

22

intended that an equitable rule be issued such that in the

23

future all school administrators within the jurisdiction of

that court would resist ever placing the child who has any

Because the school

QUESTION:

Is it your position then that the "stay-

violent student?
MR. NAGER:

The short answer is "yes," Justice White.

We do not believe that Congress —

*«>

They do not violate the "stay-put"
They would violate the EHA by not

providing an appropriate placement — a continuing appropriate
placement for that child.
Now, if the Court were to determine, however that it
was a violation of the EHA, then our argument which we
presented in our brief would kick in and we would suggest that,
nevertheless even thought there that violation would be a abuse
of discretion for the district court to order the child to be
placed back in the classroom if the child had a continuing risk
of dangerousness.
QUESTION:

But I take it, then, that a district court

in a case like this should say,

"well, the "stay-put" provision

is not violated by a suspension of a violent student, but I
have got to make sure that the school is promptly taking care
of this?

QUESTION:

Well, Ms. Brogna, we are dealing with

situations that are not always predictable and human beings do
not always operate with perfection, as we know.

But if a case

such as this is properly before a district court, do you not
agree that the district court, if it is asked

relief, should make the kind of balancing traditionally made by
courts in granting an injunction, as suggested by the
Solicitor-General?

Is that not proper?

MS. BROGNA:

It is absolutely proper.

argument with that.

balancing inquiry here, do you think?

it in the Appendix at^pages 64 through 66. And again, at I

is correct that the district court has discretion despite the

I agree with you, but let us just be clear

what we are saying, if we say that only the injunction — only

25

MS. BROGNA:

Yes, we think that the statutory scheme

is set up so that, for example, when a child acts out in the

2

classroom, the school districts may immediately suspend him.

of up to five days.

there is a regulatory ruling that suspensions of more than five

20

QUESTION:

We are construing a statute here.

You are

saying that a suspension under the statute is not a change in

placement and does not violate the "stay-put' rule.

MS. BROGNA:

That is correct in the interpretation

that comes from the comments that interpret the language of

10

QUESTION:

Ms. Brogna, if your position is correct on

11

the statute and that there is no authority for the school

12

district to make any exception for a dangerous child, other

13

than the five-day suspension in California, will not the

14

inevitable effect be that a school would want to place such a

15

child in the most restrictive environment at the outset, rather

16

than run the risk that it otherwise would, that it could change

17

the placement if the child acts out?

18

MS. BROGNA:

Well, Justice O'Connor, we would

19

certainly hope not, because one of the main purposes of the

20

Education for the Handicapped Act was to mainstream these

21

children and have them educated with non-handicapped to the

22

maximum extent possible, so that --

23

QUESTION:

Yes, but if you are going to be held

24

liable -- if you make a misjudgment in the placement, then it

25

seems to me it is human nature that would cause the school to

Heritage

40
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

be very conservative in making the placements in the first

2

instance, so I think the result you may get could be one you

3

would not want.

4

MS. BROGNA:

It could be.

We would suggest that the

5

Act has been very expansive in providing funding and the

6

impetus for training personnel for innovative teaching

7

techniques for looking at related services and all sorts of

8

alternative educational programs to deal with and address the

9

handicaps-of these children.

One would hope that they would

10

not take the sort of low risk alternative of simply returning

11

to the 1975s, where as this Court recognized, handicapped

12

children were simply warehoused, or segregated in separate

13

programs.

14

QUESTION:

15

out of the program.

16

only with the consent of the parent —

17

MS. BROGNA:

18

QUESTION:

Well, it is not that they cannot get them
They can get them out of the program but

That is, of course, always the problem.
And one would assume that the parent would

19

not want to leave them in a program where he is likely to choke

20

somebody.

21

MS. BROGNA:

That is an assumption we have always

22

made also, but it is predicated upon the school district

23

offering in good faith a reasonable alternative.

24

to remind the Court that, in this case, no such alternative was

25

offered to the Plaintiffs.

Heritage

Again, I have

En fact, no discussion of related

41
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

services, no discussion of alternative programs was ever

2

proposed, and we suggest that makes the difference.

3

In viewing the comprehensive nature of this statute,

4

I would finish by saying that the court's Order under the

5

direction of 1414(d) that, in some circumstances, the State

6

Department of Education would be held responsible for provision

7

of services to a handicapped child directly is in keeping with

8

this comprehensive nature and purpose of the statute, that

9

above and beyond all else, handicapped children should receive

10

an education.

We submit that 1414(d) does contemplate a

11

situation exactly like what happened in 1980 in San Francisco

12

when you have a local school district to follow the law;

13

unwilling to maintain a handicapped student in the current

14

placement; unwilling to abide by the provisions of (e)(3) — we

15

believe it was correct for the district court to say that in

16

circumstances such as that, the State Department as the

17

ultimately responsible agency, must step in, provide education

18

to that handicapped child in the interim, to ensure that,

19

regardless of which agency is ultimately responsible, the

20

child, at least, does not suffer a lack of education while the

21

dispute is being resolved.

Thank you.
