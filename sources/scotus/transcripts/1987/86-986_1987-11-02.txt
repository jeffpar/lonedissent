CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument this

Mr. Keskey, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DON L. KESKEY

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. KESKEY:

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

10

Court.

11

the Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit.

12

Michigan Act 144, which regulates the securities of utilities

13

and natural gas companies, is implicitly preempted by the

14

Natural Gas Act because Congress had the purpose to deregulate

15

securities of natural gas companies.

16

This case involves a review of two major holdings of
The first that

Secondly, for the opposite purpose that FERC was

17

sufficiently regulating securities under its Section 7

18

certificate powers and thirdly because of what the Court viewed

19

as an imminent possibility of conflict between Michigan Act 144

20

Securities Regulation and the Natural Gas Act.

21

In addition, the Court of Appeals found that Michigan

22

Act 144 represented an unconstitutional burden on interstate

23

commerce on all tests, the per se of discrimination test, the

24

balancing test of Pike v. Bruce Church and also on the basis of

25

a need for national uniformity with respect to Securities

1

regulation of natural gas companies.

2

In reaching these holdings, the Sixth Circuit Court

3

of Appeals failed to follow this Court's preemption test, and

4

failed to follow Congressional intent in the Natural Gas Act.

5

Congress, in the Natural Gas Act, did not occupy the whole

6

field of natural gas regulation, it did not speak to Securities

7

regulation whatsoever, it did not preempt the States from

8

regulating securities by its silence in the NGA regarding this

9

subject.

This Court has held extensively in Panhandle Eastern

10

that the purpose of the NGA was to close regulatory gaps

11

brought about by the prior decisions of this Court in a

12

specific area, interstate transportation of gas and sales for

13

resales.

14

of natural gas companies.
QUESTION:

15
16

It did not involve the area of Securities regulation

Mr. Keskey, what is the purpose exactly of

the Michigan State statutes in this regard?
MR. KESKEY:

17

The purpose of the Michigan statutes is

18

to protect the public interest, the public health safety and

19

welfare.

20
21

22

QUESTION:

Be a little more specific.

That doesn't

tell me much.
MR. KESKEY:

One of the major purposes is to ensure

23

that the extensive pipeline facilities and storage facilities,

24

the property located within the State does not become over

25

collateralized, the company doesn't become over capitalized so

that the maintenance and the safety and environmental concerns

2

regarding those facilities are not harmed.
Secondly, that there is reliable service to the

4

public.

5

at least oligopolies.

6

markets substantial markets in Michigan are very integral to

7

the livelihood, the existence of the people in Michigan and to

8

the economic development of the State.

11

In large part, these are still monopoly companies, or

QUESTION:

The service of natural gas the captive

Is it intended at all to make available

gas to Michigan consumers at reasonable rates?
MR. KESKEY:

It can protect the rate payers by

12

ensuring that over capitalization does not result, to ensure

13

that there are not abuses in financings.

21

QUESTION:

Well, is an effect on rates one of the

purposes of the legislation?
MR. KESKEY:

No.

It's not designed to regulate rates

or interstate rates.
QUESTION:

Did your State Court ever find that one of

the purposes was to ensure reasonable utility rates?
MR. KESKEY:

The State Court indicates that's one of

the purposes.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. KESKEY:

But you disavow that as a purpose?
No, no, not whatsoever.

By protecting

24

against financing abuses, and by protecting against over

25

collateralization, you can ensure that service will be

6
1

available at reasonable rates, that you will not get financing

2

that will eventually end up being a burden on the company and

3

would eventually harm service to Michigan at reasonable rates.

4

It's not an attempt to address rate making because we recognize

5

fully that that is a function of FERC, and we intervene in rate

6

cases at FERC, but it is to ensure that there is not an affect

7

from financing actions which results in damage to the financial

8

viability of both the natural gas assets and to the companies

9

themselves.
QUESTION:

10

Actually the State does not impose this

11

what you describe as Securities regulation on any companies

12

except rate regulated companies, though, isn't that right?
I mean, you refer to it as Securities regulation, but

13
14

it's not a general Securities law that applies to all

15

companies.

16

MR. KESKEY:

It applies to public utilities and to

17

natural gas companies, or interstate electric companies.

18

the Federal Power Act 204, Congress expressly recognized that

19

States could continue to engage in this kind of regulation with

20

respect to interstate electric companies.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. KESKEY:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

So the answer to my question is?
That this?
It is imposed only on rate regulated

public utilities, certain rate regulated public utilities?
MR. KESKEY:

Essentially public utility type

QUESTION:

So why don't we call it public utility

regulation instead of security regulation?
MR. KESKEY:

It's really the same thing, or they're

extremely closely related.
QUESTION:

Does the Securities and Exchange

Commission, for example, do anything of this sort
MR. KESKEY:

The Securities and Exchange Commission

11

has Acts which involve registration and the filing of

12

information.

QUESTION:

14

companies, does it?

15

MR. KESKEY:

It doesn't police the dead equity ratio of

No, it does not.

And it does not look

16

at the Key which Act 144 does, and that is what is the

17

relationship between the capital and the value of the assets on

18

the balance sheet and the good will of the business.

Because if they do, and they try to shift that onto
the company it could come back to haunt.
QUESTION:

Well, there's constitutional doctrine,

4

isn't there, that a company is entitled, constitutionally

5

entitled to a reasonable return on its investments, and the

6

State probably has an interest in looking at what those

7

investments are.

MR. KESKEY:

It's really pretty much dealing with the

problem before the fact.

In other words, FERC looks at rates

It doesn't matter as far as the regulation

is concerned whether the regulated company by Michigan is a

Michigan corporation or of some other State.

22

MR. KESKEY:

One of the respondents happens to be a

23

Michigan corporation, but the important thing here is the

24

substance of their relationship to Michigan and the substantial

25

presence and importance to Michigan, not specific --

QUESTION:

1

Well, if your answer to me is, it does

2

not matter whether it's a Michigan Corporation or of some other

3

State?

4

MR. KESKEY:

That is an additional item that does

5

matter, but the primary thing we're looking at here besides the

6

corporation filing requirements and the regulation as a

7

Michigan Corporation is the substantial context and important

8

nexus of these companies to Michigan's public interest.

just the fact that they are a Michigan corporation, and one of

QUESTION:

They're business is substantially in

Well, any interstate pipeline that goes

into Michigan is the life blood to Michigan, isn't it?
MR. KESKEY:

To certain segments or portions of

Michigan, that's correct.
QUESTION:

So you're asserting that that gives

19

Michigan authority to regulate, you certainly wouldn't assert

20

that gives Michigan the authority to regulate all interstate

21

pipelines just because they're essential to Michigan?

22

MR. KESKEY:

We're not trying to regulate any Federal

23

area, such as rates, transportation, sales for resale.

QUESTION:

What happens, Mr. Keskey, if the State

than debt, and FERC says, well, we're sorry, you have too much

equity, and we're not going to allow you any rate of return on

this equity, you should have done this by debt.

22

MR. KESKEY:

Michigan's review primarily looks at the

23

relationship of the overall capital compared to the overall

24

value of the property and the business.

25

capitalization comes in.

Heritage

That's where over

It's not the capital ratio, which

you're talking about.

6

we think you should have been in debt equities instead at

lower rate of return, of course, and therefore, we're

to allow you the normal rate of return on equity securities?

9

That's very indirect.

Michigan says you cannot issue debt

I would presume in that situation that

the Company would go to the Commission and present the rate

MR. KESKEY:

Hypothetical capital structures in the

cases will testify as to what the appropriate ratios are of

are utilities in the United States are within those reasonable

ranges.

risk is lower, and the economists will testify that the more

equity you have, the lower cost you assign to it, because of

this reflection of less business risk.

4

totter in a sense that if you have more and more equity,

5

usually the economists in a rate case will assign lower and

6

lower costs to that common equity so that it approaches debt.

7
8

So you're on a teeter

Now, you've given me an example which first of all
hypothetical capital structure is extremely rare.

9

QUESTION:

I've read a lot of rate cases where the

10

rate making agency has disallowed return on equity because the

11

agency said there shouldn't be that much equity.

12

MR. KESKEY:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. KESKEY:

It occurs.

That's not uncommon at all, is it?
In terms of percentage of cases, it's

15

rare.

16

between rate cases, which is usually an extensive period of

17

time, would either not get rate reflection for it, or would

18

make adjustments in its financial structure to accommodate

19

that.

20

It does occur.

That's correct.

QUESTION:

And in that instance, the company

Well, what would happen here?

Is your

21

position that Michigan would have to yield as to what its

22

decision concerning the proper action of the company should be?

23

Would Michigan have to yield or would the company simply have

24

to obey Michigan and get a lower rate of return?

you would get to this, and those are important because there

MR. KESKEY:

There is a theoretical possibility that

require that no more debt be issued because the company was

over capitalized or because it was issuing debts for an

13

unlawful purpose, and FERC would have required them indirectly

common equity, let's say, that there is this situation.

I think the best way to answer it is to

16

give you an example of how Michigan used this statute to

17

protect its local interests without affecting any interests

18

that are national or involve interstate commerce.

19

not a hypothetical but an actual case.

20

And that is

In 1981, ANR, the parent company, owned Michigan

21

Consolidated Gas, which was a local utility.

The Michigan

22

Public Service Commission, throughout its existence and in more

23

recent years, has promoted in Michigan the development of vast

24

natural gas storage fields which are huge caverns thousands of

25

feet below where the gas can be stored in natural sea beds.

facilities, and MichCon had its lines between one part of its

service area in Detroit and another part of its service

territory in northern Michigan.

Many of these fields were developed and Mich

And ANR came up with a proposal to divest MichCon
from its system.

But it wasn't going to just divest MichCon.

10

It was going to take for itself all of these storage facilities

11

that the Michigan ratepayer had paid for and had developed.

12

was going to take all of these transmission lines that

13

connected the company together so that MichCon would be left as

14

an orphan on the doorstep of the Michigan Public Service

So we used the statute because people were walking

3

around saying, what's happening, we can't get any information.

4

What's happening is the fact that the parent company is going

5

to strip our utility of all the assets that are valuable and

leave everything that's not valuable on the backs of the

Michigan public.

MR. TRIENENS:

Chief Justice, may it please the

None of those 33 States regulate interstate

local distribution.

debt equity ratio is a crucial part of that.

15

that it is only rare that the FERC exercises that power to

grant rates that impute a different capital structure.

reason it's rate is that FERC has made its standards so widely

known that you don't dare go otherwise.

5

That cannot happen under a FERC regulated company,

and the reason is, apart from certification, apart from rate

making, FERC regulates the accounting, and if there's anyone in

this world it was Charlie Smith, the head of the Bureau of

Accounts of the FPC, who was the most vigilant original cost

proponent and insisted on original cost accounting.

Now, there's one other thing.

So the

It cannot happen.

The timing is

their brief.
They want this Statute because it provides an

opportunity for the Michigan Commission to assure that ANR does

4

not violate the divestiture settlements.

5

settlements they're talking about are the same settlements —

6

and I was going to say, blackjacked out of us -- but I'll honor

7

the nomenclature they now use -- these are the same settlements

8

they clubbed out of us before, and how instead of enforcing

9

those settlements which are agreements, actual signed

Now, the divestiture

10

agreements, instead of enforcing those agreements the old

11

fashioned way by going to court to sue on the contract, they

12

want this club to hit us over the head to make sure we honor

13

whatever interpretation they want to place on it.

14

That's what this case is about.

It's the only use

15

they have for it.

16

they want to keep it.

17

I agree with everything that's said that these examples are not

18

necessary.

19

without these examples, past and future, this is a plain flat

20

out violation of the Commerce clause.

But they've got so used to using it on us,
Now, that's not a legitimate use.

As I said, the over capitalization theme which the

QUESTION:

When you start dealing

Well, we're going to have to -- I suppose

5

we'll have to make up our mind as to which one to deal with

6

first?

7

MR. TRIENENS:

Yeah.

I think the way you do it is

8

the way you've done it in a dozen cases.

Is you go into the

9

history of the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act, and you

10

say here were the Constitutional decisions that led to that

11

Act, here was the line that was drawn, here's the field they

12

covered, and that's the end of it.
QUESTION:

13
14

Is what you call a preemption argument, is

that it?

constitutional issue?

MR. TRIENENS:

QUESTION:

Yeah, when they occupied the field.

It's a Supremacy Clause argument.

But sometimes it's called sort of a

statutory?

first, although when you get into the Commerce Clause history

MR. TRIENENS:

That's correct.

I think the logic is

10

that you deal with the history of this.

11

that Congress did act, and I think that's the end of it.

12

know there's a lot of controversy about commerce clause cases,

13

and you don't have to really decide this as though Congress had

14

not acted, because Congress has acted.

15

QUESTION:

You get into the fact
I

So you don't think there's any real

16

inconsistency in saying, of course, this is not preempted but

17

it violates the Commerce Clause?

18

MR. TRIENENS:

19
20

All I'm saying is, it violates the

Commerce Clause if there'd never been a Natural Gas Act.
QUESTION:

Well, then suppose we disagree with you on

21

preemption that Congress never intended to preempt this kind of

22

thing, but nevertheless, it violates the Commerce Clause, a

23

dormant Commerce Clause?
