CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We will hear arguments

versus Norge Division of Magic Chef.
Mr. Levy, you may proceed whenever you are

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL ALAN LEVY, ESQUIRE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LEVY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

11

the Court, under Illinois law as in approximately two-thirds

12

of the states an employer may not fire an employee for

13

seeking workers' compensation benefits, and an employee who

14

is thus victimized may seek redress in the state courts.

15

The reason why Illinois provides this cause of

16

action is that it doesn't want employees to be discouraged

17

from seeking workers' compensation benefits by the risk that

18

they will be discharged from their employment.

19

Next Illinois had to decide whether an employee

20

loses those rights by going to work in a shop which i s

21

covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

22

Supreme Court held, no, you don't lose those rights? rather,

23

the right of action is available to union and non-union

24

employees alike, and again Illinois in this respect is in

25

accord with the majority of state courts that have
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4886

The Illinois

3

1

considered the question, at least as a matter of state law.

2

The question in this case is whether Conqress has

3

deprived the State of Illinois of the right to make this

4

judgment by passing Section 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act,

5

which provides a means for the enforcement of collective

6

bargaining agreements, or by passing Section 203 of that same

7

Act, which enunciates a national policy favoring abitral

8

resolution of disputes about the application or interpre­

9

tation of collective bargaining agreements.

10

Although the Court has held that Congress intended

11

to supersede state laws providing for the enforcement of

12

collective bargaining agreements, there is no basis for

13

concluding that Congress also intended these statutes

14

to supersede state substantive regulation of the terms and

15

conditions of employment in work places covered by

16

collective bargaining agreements.

17

Given the presumption against preemption of state

18

law claims, the burden is on respondent to show that

Congress would have wanted to preempt the type of claim

at stake here.

Congress wanted to preclude state regulation of the

1

because the statute speaks only of suits for vilations of

2

contracts, and suits or a policy concerning the application

3

and interpretation of collective bargaining agreements.

4

The court below nevertheless held that Lingle's

S

claim was preempted.

which respondents principally relied below was Alice Chalmers

versus Lueck.

10

The case on which it relied and on

In our view, not only does Alice Chalmers

In Alice Chalmers the Court held that Section 301

11

preempts an employee's tort claim for bad faith denial of

12

contractual rights.

13

Court reasoned, it would inevitably be necessary to define

14

the employee's contract rights, to decide whether they had

15

been denied, whether they had been denied in bad faith, and

16

what consequences should show from that denial of contrac­

17

tual rights .

18

In order to rule on that claim, the

Thus the Court said in order to -- that state law

19

claim is substantially dependent on interpretation of the

20

collective bargaining agreement, and allowing that sort of

state claim to proceed would interfere with a policy

But there certainly is a right under

QUESTION:

And you think both causes of action

can just go forward?
MR. LEVY:

That is correct.

At most the statutory

19

and collectively bargained rights are parallel, but that is

20

not enough to preclude the employee's right to go forward in

21

state court.

QUESTION:

And what was the relief that the

QUESTION:

Will the recovery -- if you win, will

6

the recovery -- would the recovery in a state court action

7

include back pay again, or what?

8

MR. LEVY:

I assume that state law would provide

9

for some sort of a setoff for interim income, and

10

presumably interim income includes any back pay that was

11

awarded by the arbitrator.

QUESTION:

If the state court --

MR. LEVY:

Unemployment compensation as well.

If the state court suit goes first

you get a complete recovery so you can't arbitrate.
MR. LEVY:

If the state court action went first

it would be unnecessary to arbitrate.

QUESTION:

Well, it would just be barred, I suppose.

MR. LEVY:

I don't know whether the employer --

So the — but you don't think in the

state court action it will ever be necessary to construe the

22

23

MR. LEVY:

In this state court action it will

certainly not be necessary, not only because there has

already been an arbitral ruling, but also because the

false claim without looking at the collective bargaining

MR. LEVY:

Let me step back a moment, because in

2

using the word "relitigate" the claim I think I conceded

3

a bit too much.

She has a state law claim and she has a

4

contract claim.

And there may be some common facts, but the

5

state law claim has not in fact been resolved in the

arbitration.

it would be a good defense to a state action if the claim

1

that you should give the arbitral determination great weight,

2

assuming that the conditions set forth in Gardner-Denver are

3

met.

4

QUESTION:

But even if there were some sort of

5

of federal principle that required the state court to

6

give collateral estoppel effect to the finding that the

7

claim has been false, that would not affect your basic

8

preemption argument, I take it.

9

MR. LEVY:

I --

10

QUESTION:

I mean, the suit for discriminatory

11

discharge for invoking the workmen's comp could still

12

proceed even though the state court might have to treat a

13

particular finding on that point as binding for factual

14

purporses.

15

MR. LEVY:

Yes, I understand.

Then the question

16

would be presented whether that factual determination as a

17

matter of state law determines the outcome of the state law

18

suit.
QUESTION:

19

What about collateral estoppel vice

20

versa?

21

if the state court litigation had gone ahead first, would

22

be bound on that factual determination by the state court

j udgment?

Do you have any view on whether the arbitrator,

QUESTION:

We usually don't go around trying the

3

same fact twice in two separate proceedings and coming out

4

different ways.

5

MR. LEVY:

If you have two separate -- two different

6

jurisdictions and two separate claims, for example, in the

7

Gardner-Denver type -- Gardner-Denver was a claim which

8

was —• went forward in two different fora.

common factual issues that had been decided in one pro­

also didn't say it was accepted as conclusive.

be appropriate to give the abitral disposition greater or

QUESTION:

So you think the arbitrator miqht be

24

able to ignore the state court judgment as to what the

25

facts were?
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

11

1

I very much doubt that.

2

MR. LEVY:

I don't know whether the full faith and

3

credit clause, for example, would govern an arbitral deter­

4

mination through Section 301.

5

you a good answer to the question.

6

I really just can't give
I'm sorry.

I would say, however, that because of the time­

7

liness in filing a grievance, unless the arbitration drags

8

on for a long time, and I must say sometimes they do as they

9

did in this case, usually the arbitration is going to be

10

held first, if an arbitration is held at all.

11

I would mention that many of these grievances

12

don't even get to arbitration because they are disposed of

13

somewhere short of that.

14

QUESTION:

Isn't your correct answer sugaested

15

by the Chief Justice's question, that what we have is an

16

issue of preemption, not of collateral estoppe?

17

question that would arise when you have that happen.

That is a

18

MR. LEVY:

19

In any event, in Alice Chalmers the Court tried

That is certainly not this case.

20

to distinguish between the contract based claims that were

21

at stake in the Lewis case and state claims that are based

22

on substantive regulation of employment, and what the COurt

23

said in Alice Chalmers, equally applicable here, we believe,

24

is that it would be inconsistent with Congressional intent

25

under Section 301 to preempt state rules that proscribe
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

12

1

conduct or establish rights and obligations independent of

2

the labor agreement, and if there is any state employment

3

cause of action which is independent of the labor agreement,

4

Lingle's claim ought to be one of them.

5

So, consistent with the Court's analysis in Alice

6

Chalmers, which has been reaffirmed in several cases since

7

then, Lingle's claim should not be held to be preempted.

8

Indeed, although respondent has not pointed to any

9

indication that Congress would want to forbid lawsuits for

10

retaliatory discharge, there is at least some evidence of

11

Congressional intent which cuts against preemption.

12

has enacted numerous substantive regulations of the terms

13

and conditions of employment in the private sector.

14

alone.

16

Conaress

In our

Not only do those forms of substantive regulation

17

exist side by side with rights which may be granted by the

18

collective bargaining agreement, but this Court has

19

repeatedly ruled in the Gardner-Denver and Barrentine line

20

of cases that employees may enforce their rights under those

21

statutes, including the right against discharge, independent

22

of collectively bargained grievance procedures.

23

Evidently Congress doesn't see this form of

24

regulation as inconsistent with collective baraaining or as

25

inconsistent with a national policy favoring arbitration
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

13

1

of disputes about the interpretation or application of

2

the collective bargaining agreement.

3

Now, it is true those cases involve federal

4

claims while this case involves a state claim, but there

5

is no reason to think that Congress would want to treat

6

state claims differently.

7

them similarly. For example, in Metropolitan Life Insurance

8

the Court cited Barrentine and Gardner-Denver as authority

9

for the lack of Congressional intent to preempt state

10

substantive regulation of employment conditions.

11

Indeed, this Court has treated

And in Alice Chalmers, in Footnote 8 the Court

12

pointed to Gardner-Denver as an example of an independent

13

cause of action.

14

Now, in this Court respondent has relied for the

15

first time on Teamsters v. Oliver and similar cases which

16

hold according to respondent that the federal labor laws

17

preempt any state cause of action that relates to a mandatory

18

subject of baraaining.
Now, leaving aside whether that argument,

19

20

essentially based on NLRA preemption as opposed to Section

21

301 preemption, was properly preserved in the Court of

22

Appeals.

23

argument has been repeatedly rejected by the Court in

24

recent years, most pointedly in Metropolitan Life Insurance,

25

where the Court said that it would turn the policy that

For present purposes it suffices to note that the

preventing them from benefitting from state labor regulations

imposing minimum standards on non-union employers.

Similarly in Fort Halifax and Caterpillar the
Court rejected the same argument.
Indeed, the argument was rejected as long ago as

should not accept respondent's invitation to reopen this

be reversed.

from your argument they could not make that agreement.
MR. LEVY:

I would say no, that would certainly

be a more explicit waiver, but then the question is, can

25

the employer and the union contract themselves out of the
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

procedures provided by state law, and I would say no.

2

QUESTION:

I know you have these federal

3

precedents, but do you have any case holding that a state

4

law claim like this cannot be waived by -- we had a case

5

under the Federal Arbitration Act a couple of years ago

6

where they held that an employee's claim of some kind,

7

even though California law said it could not be waived, the

8

Court held that the Federal Arbitration Act applied, and

9

the waiver was valid, so why wouldn't the reasoning of that

10

case apply in the labor context as well?

policy favoring arbitration in the union context is at

20

least as strong as the policy favoring arbitration

implemented by the Federal Arbitration Act.

22

MR. LEVY:

But the waiver in that case at least

23

has been made by the individual employee in an individual

24

contract of employment.

25

QUESTION:

Yes, but you certainly wouldn't say

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

16
1

that a collective bargaining agent doesn't have the same

2

authority to represent the individual employee in bargaining

3

the terms of employment.

4
5

MR. LEVY:

Not with . respect to bargaining away

non-negotiable rights that the state has decided should

6

be non-negotiable.

7

could be channeled into arbitration, and although this case

8

may look like a case in which at least you can get some

9

relief in arbitration, many cases, if an employee is left

10

only with the duty of fair representation remedy, when the

11

union either doesn't succeed in getting all the employee

12

wants or in fact the union doesn't get anything for the

13

employee, in a lot of cases there is not even going to be an

14

arbitration.

15

The union may decide that it is aqainst the collective

16

interest to go forward with this particular claim.

17

the duty of fair representation is going to be vastly

18

expanded, at least in this context of state law rights, what

19

you are doing, the choice of the forum, as the Court said

20

in Gardner-Denver, inevitably affects the scope of the

21

substantive right.

22

If that were true, all state rights

The case may be settled short of arbitration.

Unless

And what the Court would be doing would be

23

requiring the states which have very important policies

which they think can't be effectively implemented through

25

the collective bargaining and collective grievance

(202) 628-4888

17

1

processing method, requiring those states to give up their

2

right to have those policies enforced.

3

is good policy to do so, this Court has continually allowed

4

the states and held that the states are not preempted from

5

regulation of the substantive terms and conditions of

6

employment, and the effect of the approach that is suggested

7

by your question would be to do that.

8

QUESTION:

Whether or not it

Mr. Levy, so I can understand your

9

position, I assume you would say our decision last term

10

in Heckler, which involved a state statute that sought to

11

impose liability for breach of a state -- state-imposed

12

duty arising from the contractual relationship of a union

13

with the employees that it represents through the contract

14

with the employer, you would say that that case would have

15

come out differently if the state law had simply read every

16

union shall have an obligation to provide for the safety

17

of its employees on the iob, assuming that that law would

18

pass muster under the National Labor Relations Act.

19

MR. LEVY:

It would certainly not be preempted

20

by Section 301.

21

you are imposing additional duties --

There might be a question about whether

That the NLRA doesn't allow.

MR. LEVY:

— beyond those which 8(b)(1)(A) imposes

on unions, and whether that is somehow inconsistent with the

25

policy behind (8)(b)(1)(A).
Heritage Reporting Corporation

Under Section 301, yes.
Thank you, Mr. Levy.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

8

MR. JACKSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

9

the Court, the issue in this case is whether a state court

10

judge or legislature may provide employees a cause of

11

action for wrongful discharge when those employees are

12

covered by the grievance arbitration procedures of a

13

collective bargaining agreement and the employee's claim

14

is unquestionably arbitrable under the terms of that

15

agreement.

16

Resolution of this question, we feel, calls for

17

an analysis of two central policies informing Section 301

18

of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947.

19

policy -- the section -- that if within Section 301 scope

20

Section 301 completely preempts any state law cause of

21

action within its scope.

22

First, the

And second, the settled rule, the contractual

23

grievance arbitration -- excuse me, contractual arbitration

24

procedures are the exclusive and final remedy for labor

25

contract disputes.

At least in her reply brief, petitioner seems

2

to agree that the question presented here has been left

3

open, was left open in the Lueck decision, the Alice

4

Chalmers versus Lueck decision.

5

reserved judgment on whether an independent non-negotiable

6

state imposed duty could nevertheless be preempted under

7

Section 301.

8

QUESTION:

In that case, this Court

Incidentally, counsel, you began by

9

saying the question was whether or not a wrongful discharge

10

cause of action can be prosecuted or is preempted, but this

11

is a retaliatory discharge.

12

there ?

13

MR. JACKSON:

There is a difference, isn't

We think that the retaliatory

14

discharge claim in Illinois as it is so labeled in Illinois

15

is simply another species of wrongful discharge tort, and I

16

use the phrase to illustrate the point that I think -- we

17

think it is destructive of the policies informing Section

18

301 to allow states to single out a variety of causes of

19

action that were meant to be grist in the mills of the

20

arbitrators under the labor agreements, and that is why I

21

use that term.

22

QUESTION:

And it is improper to single out

23

retaliatory acts for insisting on workmen's compensation

24

rights ?

25

MR. JACKSON:

Yes, we say that that claim, that

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

20

1

cause of action deals directly with employment rights.

2

states historically have had a great deal of leeway with

3

respect to workers' compensation matters, but always in the

4

context of the benefits workers would receive for work-

5

related injuries.

6

The

The recent phenomenon of retaliatory discharge

7

claims addresses itself to employment rights .

8

something that is squarely governed by the collective

9

bargaining agreement, and even if the state's interest is

10

arguably an important one, it is still preempted under

11

Section 301, because Section 301, unlike the balancing

12

analysis utilized in Metropolitan Life and other cases under

13

the National Labor Relations Act, does not weigh the state's

14

interest with the rights asserted under federal policy.

IS

QUESTION:

That is

What if the union and the employer

16

set out to say, you know, we are really going to have a

17

comprehensive agreement here, we are going to provide for

18

benefits in case you are injured on the job.

19

will pay them under the collective bargaining agreement.

20

Now, does that mean that a state can't even enforce

21

its workmen's compensation law?

22

MR. JACKSON:

23
24
25

The employer

No, I think the state in that

situation can enforce its workmen's compensation.
QUESTION:

Why is one different from the

other if each situation is covered by the collective
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

21

bargaining agreement?

2

MR. JACKSON:

Because in that situation this

3

Court has recognized, even in the Oliver decision, on which

4

we place a lot of reliance, that state laws dealing with

5

health and safety matters have historically been those that

6

the Court has recognized where the state has a lot of leeway.

7

The state can promulgate laws prohibiting the use of child

8

labor.

9

contract whereby child labor could be used, that tvpe of

10

law could not be enforced for two reasons, not because the

11

contract terms themselves of themselves always prevail

12

over state rights, but because in that situation the contract

13

terms would be promoting no federal interest.

14

If the union and the company were to agree to a

Section 301 does not promote the interest of

15

exploitation of children nor does it promote the interest

16

of depriving employees —

17

QUESTION:

Well, but in a workmen's compensation

18

case you can certainly say it proposed smooth, speedy

19

adjustment of grievances under the contract, and the contract

20

gives the person the same rights they have against the

21

employer as the Illinois law would.

22

MR. JACKSON:

I think it could.

My response, Mr.

23

Chief Justice, is simply that that is an area where this

24

Court has said and we have agreed in this case that with

25

respect to health and safety laws the states do have leeway.

QUESTION:

But it is only demonstrably health and

2

safety laws, not other important concerns of state public

policy.

4

MR. JACKSON:

The states have the most latitude

5

with respect to health and safety laws.

6

I think, as the Alice Chalmers case pointed out, is one for

7

resolution on a case by case basis.

8

the petitioner is not a health and safety right.

under the collective bargaining agreement.

18

problems with respect to states promulgating benefit rules,

19

but beyond that, in the Alessi case this Court also noted

20

that because the terms in that particular situation were

21

embodied in a collective bargaining agreement, workers'

22

compensation related benefits, they were also preempted by

23

the Teamsters versus Oliver rule.

necessarily have a carte blanche in that situation, as

2

illustrated by the Alessi case.

3

Petitioner's position distills two related

4

propositions, one, that any right created by a state court

5

judge or legislature that can be articulated without reference

6

to the labor contract is necessarily independent within the

7

meaning of Alice Chalmers, and two, a basic assumption

8

that all such positive law rights necessarily coexist side

by side with the labor agreement and avoid preemption under

Section 301.

18

and unions have the authority to agree to wages below that

20

it may be the case, as Your Honor points out, in other

21

states, but at least in Illinois it is not part of the

22

worker's compensation scheme, and in fact it is a tort.

23

It is not -- the employee does not have a statutory cause

of action to go to the workers' compensation committee and

QUESTION:

Well, here is a state —

MR. JACKSON:

QUESTION:

And we also —

Here is a state law that says, if you

commit this tort you are going to get actual damages,

5

punitive damages, whatever it is, and now the union and the

employer say, well, if you commit this — if you commit this

act which is a tort under state law, all you are going to

get is back pay.

than what the state law says you are entitled to.

10

that just like minimum wage laws?

You are just going to get much less

MR. JACKSON:

Isn't

No, I think the minimum wage law

is different for two reasons.

that type of agreement is not a policy of Section 301.

Second, equally important, the federal policy

under the Barrentine decision, the federal policy says that

parties to labor contracts cannot contract for minimum wages

below the federal level.

19

in the minimum wage context that the states -- that is an

20

affirmance that the states have that kind of latitude.

QUESTION:

That is an indication at least

Let me ask you, preemption of state

causes of action is -- occurs because of some evil that

non-preemption would cause.

Because you seem to

And to the extent there is con­

So I think that -- I think that the claim here

14

is inextricably intertwined with the terms of the labor

15

agreement.

16

which I don't think the Court should do, but even if the

17

Court were to say, yes, we can look at this claim and we

18

can view it in isolation without respect, without regard

19

to the collective bargaining agreement,

20

claim is -- a preempted claim under the rule of Teamsters

21

versus Oliver and cases like che Alessi case and the

22

California versus Taylor case.

23

we read them, held that where independent state rights

24

existed, and they flew in the teeth of a labor contract,

25

they were preempted.

But even if it's not, even if we can cast aside,

I still think the

We don't think the rule should be any

different here where this particular petitioner is

protected by contractual grievance arbitration procedures,

4

and also we feel this is the teaching of the Republic Steel

case and the U.S.

QUESTION:

Picked over on a case-by-case basis

17

in what sort of cases?

18

MR. JACKSON:

In the Metropolitan Life case,

19

for example, the Court stated that laws protecting public

20

health and safety would be preserved, child labor, minimum

21

wages, those types of laws, occupational safety and health

22

perhaps, and this, we would say, is consistent with our

23

reading of Oliver, because even Oliver, which was a broad

24

statement of Section 301 preemption, we would maintain,

25

not National Labor Relations Act preemption, even Oliver said

11

Metropolitan Life permitted the state law to be -- or the

state action to be maintained because a law requiring

13

mental health benefits in an insurance policy was not

14

deemed to be inconsistent with a duty to bargain, a duty

Metropolitan Life said so, but I

3

ago, part of the difficulty is the definition of minimum

standards and petitioner's lack of definition of minimum

standards.

6

And as I stated a little while

Under their analysis as we read it even a state

7

could promulgate a general just cause for discharge statute

8

just as the State of Montana, for example, has already enacted

9

and under that Montana law, with exceptions for collective

10

bargaining, all employees of the State of Montana have a

11

right not to be fired except for just cause, and presumably

12

there is going to be a common law developed as to what is

just cause in Montana.

My impresion has been that the just cause

case, because the reason why those exclusions are there,

2

and in the cases we cite in our brief where they don't

3

recognize the state cause of action that the petitioner

4

asserts, the irony is, is because those states feel that such

5

a claim would be preempted, so it is sort of a circular thing.

6

The reason why it is not there is that the state

feels it is preempted.

with that, and what that argument does is, it is essentially

a shorthand way of saying there is no such thing as

Finally, it is our position that the result sought

by the petitioners is a threat to arbitration, and I say

that because it has been settled for quite some time, but

exactly what takes place between countless other employers

This contractual grievance

We believe that permitting the Illinois wrongful

discharge tort to vindicate employment rights that have

17

been vindicated by the collective bargaining agreement

18

would be a threat to arbitration.

19

Petitioner's response basically is, well,

20

employers always say this.

21

of horrible things are going to happen if you give people

22

rights to bring lawsuits against companies.

23

that it is precisely because the courts have not embraced

petitioner's theory of non-preemption that arbitration has

25

been preserved.

Arbitration is a matter of agreement,

arbitration in the future if all these causes of action

are going to go on to state court.

MR. JACKSON:

I think that's precisely correct,

11

and the problem v/ith that is that in terms of national

12

labor policy, it is going to depend upon the strength of

13

the parties in any given bargaining situation.

1965, and unions and employers have gotten used to that.

16

But this is

It's different from other federal laws which have

17

imposed statutory obligations on employers they have long

18

accepted.

19

This would be authorization for states to

20

articulate and define causes of action that would give

21

remedies to employees irrespective of what is provided

22

under the collective bargaining agreement, and I think it

23

would create an unacceptable incentive to undermine

In sum, we feel that the claim is inextricably
