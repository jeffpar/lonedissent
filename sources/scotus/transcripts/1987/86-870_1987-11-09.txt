ORAL ARGUMENT OF EUGENE GRESSMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. GRESSMAN:

9
10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is an equal-footing case.

It arises out of the

12

fact that Mississippi became a member of the Union in 1817 on

13

an equal footing with the original 13 states.

14

footing" doctrine in this context means that each new state

15

that enters the Union, like Mississippi, acquires sovereign

16

title from the United States to certain underwater lands to be

17

held in trust for the benefit of all the public.

18

The "equal

Now, in this situation, and in an unbroken line of

19

decisions of this Court, dating back 145 years, to the case of

20

Martin v. Waddell, this Court has uniformly stated that the

21

sovereign title that attaches to a subsequently-admitted state,

22

relates only to lands beneath navigable waters that are usable

23

by the public for commercial purposes of navigation or other

24

commercial activities, such as fishing.

25

unbroken line of authority in this Court, that state

Heritage

This has been the

3
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

sovereignty equals title to lands under commercially navigable

2

streams, rivers and lakes.

3

always meant "navigable in fact."

4

And by "navigable," this Court has

Now, it is our position that the decision below by

5

the Mississippi supreme court is diametrically opposed to this

6

long line of authority in this Court.

7

in the Opinion below, as it appears in the Appendix to the

8

Petition, the supreme court of Mississippi says that the top of

9

the page that, "It is our view that as a matter of federal law,

For example, on page 10A

10

the United States granted to this State in 1817 all lands

11

subject to the ebb and flow of the tide and up to the then-mean

12

high water liable without regard to navigability."

13

Now that is incorrect; it is inconsistent; it is in

14

conflict with every decision that this Court has ever rendered.

15

He cites, for example, the court cites Illinois Central Rail

16

Road Company v. Illinois.

17

citation to the Illinois Central case and we find the Court

18

announcing that "ownership by the crown -- and therefore, by

19

any sovereign State, of title to lands under waters, is founded

20

not upon the existence of tide over the lands, but upon the

21

fact that the waters are navigable."

22

QUESTION:

One turns to that reference, that

Mr. Gressman, excuse me.

Is it not

23

possible to read all of those cases as extending the doctrine

24

rather than limiting it; that is, as saying,

25

navigable, the "trust" doctrine applies, whether or not the

Heritage

"if waters are

4
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

oceans' ebb and flow extends to those waters."

2

interpretation not -- although if the ebb and flow does extend

3

to the waters, the "trust" doctrine does extend to the waters,

4

the "trust" doctrine applies despite their non-navigability.

5

Is it not possible to interpret all of -- is there any of those

6

cases that would be inconsistent with such a theory?

7

navigability is the extension of the "ebb and flow"

8

jurisdiction?
MR. GRESSMAN:

9

Is that

That is,

No, Your Honor, I do not think that is

10

a fair reading of the Decisions of this Court.

11

that this Court has ever addressed a case before today where

12

all that you had were non-navigable waters plus a tidal

13

influence.

14
15
16

I do not think

In every case -QUESTION:

We have not addressed it either way:

we

have not said "yes," and we have not said "no."
MR. GRESSMAN:

That is true, but I think that if you

17

look at the purposes of the "public trust" doctrine, this Court

18

has consistently said that the purpose of the doctrine, the

19

purpose of the "egual footing" doctrine, is premised on the

20

public need to use the waters as navigable highways of

21

commerce, and that is the critical fact that justifies reading

22

the Decisions of this Court as meaning that, if you have a non-

23

navigable body of water that happens to be subject to tidal

24

influence, that kind of underwater land can never become part

25

of the public trust domain for the very reason that there is no

5

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1

purpose served; there is no commercial navigability that is

2

possible.

And therefore, the reason -QUESTION:

3

What do you do about the last ten feet of

4

the ocean, near the shore, which last ten feet are not

5

navigable?

Does that mean that that portion is not subject to

6
7

MR. GRESSMAN:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. GRESSMAN:

Certainly not, Your Honor.

And why is that?
Every navigable body of water, be it

10

the ocean, the Mississippi River, or any other large body of

11

water, has at its shore, or at its edges, a non-navigable

12

shoreline.

13

QUESTION:

Right, now, how do you know where the

14

ocean ends?

Why is it not reasonable to say that the ocean

15

ends at the point where the ebb and flow stops?

16

MR. GRESSMAN:

17

QUESTION:

Because --

Once you have accepted the principle that

18

"navigability" is not the test — as you just have -- you have

19

to decide where the ocean ends:

20

ebb and flow start?

21

MR. GRESSMAN:

why does it not end where the

There are various explanations of

22

that. That is a natural phenomenon, of course, and if the body

23

of water is subject to tidal influence, such as an ocean, one

24

can measure the extent of that navigable body of water by the

25

mean high water mark of the tide.

That is not to say that you

6

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

are granting state ownership of the entire body of water

2

because of the tidal influence, because you are simply

3

measuring the inner boundary of that body of water by the tide.

4

At the same time, you see, this was part of the

5

confusion that grew out of the English experience where all

6

navigable rivers, due to the geography of England, were the

7

same as tidally-influenced waters:

8

to the ends of most of the navigable rivers.

9

-- a synonymous expression of the royal ownership of the

10

11

the tide ebbed and flowed
And so it became

navigable of the tidally-influenced waters of England.
But we found in this country that that kind of

12

reliance or reference to tidal influence certainly does not

13

explain how the state gets domain over fresh-water streams that

14

have no tidal influence.

15

particularly the Genesee Chief case, which dealt with the

16

Admiralty jurisdiction, to dispel the notion that the critical

17

element with respect to the extent of federal admiralty

18

jurisdiction extended only to those rivers that were tidally

19

influenced.

20

And it took a number of cases,

Another point, Your Honor --

QUESTION:

Mr. Gressman, certainly Chief Justice

21

Taney's Opinion in Genesee Chief, as Justice Scalia says,

22

extends Admiralty jurisdiction to navigable waters that were

23

non-tidal, there is nothing indicating that all tidal waters

24

were not also included.

25

MR. GRESSMAN:

As long as they were navigable.

7

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

QUESTION:

1

Well, but I do not -- when you say that

2

Admiralty jurisdiction extends to "tidal waters," and then you

3

go on and say "even if they are not tidal, it extends to them

4

if they are navigable," I do not know if the necessary

5

inference is that the tidal waters which are not navigable are

6

excluded?

7

MR. GRESSMAN:

Not necessarily, as long as they are

8

navigable.

Take the Mississippi River, for example.

9

is the problem -- one of the problems that Genesee Chief was

10

talking about:

11

Mississippi River is navigable for 1,000 miles, but the tidal

12

influence is only for 30 miles up the river.

13

you take the Mississippi River.

And this

Now, the

Now, if you were to say that the public domain or

14

Admiralty jurisdiction extends only for 30 miles, as long as

15

there is a tidal influence, that made it impossible to extend

16

Admiralty jurisdiction to the remaining navigable port --

17

freshwater portions, of the Mississippi River.

18

intolerable.

19

QUESTION:

And this is

The collision of the Genesee Chief took

20

place on Lake Ontario, I thought?

21

MR. GRESSMAN:

Well, but I think that an example,

22

perhaps, is better shown -- I think he talked about examples of

23

various rivers in this country, like the Mississippi, but I

24

think that affords an example of what he was talking about.

25

Let me also add that what we are dealing with in this

8

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

case is not a navigable body of water that happens to have a

2

non-navigable shoreline. What we are talking about here is a

3

discrete, inland tributary that contributes fresh water from

4

the uplands and flows into a navigable body of water known as

5

the Jordan River.

6

trust" doctrine was ever designed to extend public ownership up

7

into interior streams completely surrounded by private riparian

8

owners, streams that do not constitute part of the shoreline of

9

a navigable body of water.

10

Now, it cannot be said that the "public

I give an example of that from Justice Fields'

11

concurring Opinion in the Knight v. U.S. Land Association case,

12

where he pointed out that it would be absurd to suggest that

13

the Chesapeake Bay, which obviously is a navigable body of

14

water tidally-influenced, that you would consider as part of

15

Chesapeake Bay, the Potomac River as far up as the tide affects

16

the Potomac River, and it does affect the tide all the way up

17

to Washington, D.C.

18

He said, "it is absolutely absurd to say that the

19

Potomac River is a part of the shoreland, or the boundary, of

20

the Chesapeake Bay; that the tidal influence that is effected

21

on this independent river, or stream, must stand or fall on its

22

own navigability, not derivative from the body of water into

23

which it flows and is not -- certainly, does not constitute

24

part of the shorelands or the tidelands of the navigable

25

Chesapeake Bay."

9

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

And he said, "It was incredible that anybody should

1
2

suggest that."

3

Mississippi is claiming here:

4

this little, discrete, independent drainage stream that has no

5

more use, no more function than to drain the heavy excess

6

rainwater off the uplands, that because that has some tidal

7

influence, therefore that must be considered part of the public

8

domain, as if it were constituted some kind of a shoreland or a

9

tideland or a tidewater of some other concededly navigable body

10

Yet that is exactly what the State of
they are claiming that, because

of water.
The State of Mississippi has never revealed what

11

12

navigable body of water these little, discrete streams are a

13

part of.

14

Jordan River, or are they the tidelands of the Bay of St.

15

Louis?

16

Gulf of Mexico, which is only five or six miles away?

17

not know.

20

Are they a part of — are they a tideland of the

An inlet of the Gulf?

QUESTION:

Or are they the tideland of the
We do

Of course, Mr. Gressman, under their

theory it really does not matter, does it?
MR. GRESSMAN:

Well, it does not matter except to say

21

that it is totally incorrect as a statement of the basis on

22

which you impose public trust dominion.

23

Public trust dominion, as this Court has said over

24

and over again, depends upon the navigability of the body of

25

water over which the state seeks this trust dominion.

10

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

And now,

1

if it is a true tideland; if it is a shoreland; a mudflat; a

2

beach of a navigable body of water, that need not deter us

3

because that is simply a physical fact that most navigable

4

bodies of water do have non-navigable shorelands -- tidelands,

5

tidewaters — however you want to describe them?
QUESTION:

6

Mr. Gressman, the Submerged Lands Act, of

7

course, has language that your opponent suggests affects the

8

resolution of the problem:

9

or periodically covered by tidal waters are included as lands

10

beneath navigable waters.

11

bearing on this case?
MR. GRESSMAN:

12

it says that all lands permanently

Do you think that that has some

No, Your Honor.

The submerged land

13

act -- and this was fully explored, by the way in Justice

14

Rhenquist's Opinion in the State Land Board v. Corvallis

15

Company in footnote no.4 of that Opinion, at 429 at page 371

16

that the effect of the Submerged Lands Act merely was to

17

confirm the states' title to beds of navigable waters within

18

their boundaries as against the United States claims.

19

does not alter the scope or effect of the "equal footing"

20

doctrine.

21

And it

And quoting from the Bonelli case, which in other

22

respects was overruled in Corvallis, quoting the Bonelli case,

23

this Court stated -- and I think this is a critical restatement

24

of the -- applicable law here:

25

to lands [that means underwater lands] that are unnecessary to

"A state cannot base its claims

11

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

a navigational purpose."
Now, that means that the state can claim domain only

2
3

over those waters considered by and of themselves that are

4

necessary to serve as public highways of commerce a

5

navigational purpose — a commercially navigational purpose.
And that is the whole history; that is the whole

6
7

meaning; that is the whole rationale — for the "public trust"

8

doctrine, which has been incorporated into the "egual footing"

9

doctrine.

And the Court below simply turns away from that long

10

history and states that lands -- that title:

11

can be based solely upon the ebb and flow of the tide without

12

regard to navigability.

13

this Court's long line of decisions.

14

that has ever said that you can base public title solely on the

15

basis of the ebb and flow of the tide.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

property title,

That is just totally inconsistent with

Oh, no.

I do not know any case

I do not think it says you

cannot, either.
MR. GRESSMAN:

Well, the inference is that if, from

19

the fact that, if public title, public trust title, is the

20

equivalent of navigability purposes, shall we say — that

21

necessarily excludes from the public trust concept those waters

22

that are not suitable for commercial navigation.

23

what this Court must have met in Illinois Central, and in other

24

repeated declarations when it said that,

25

"ebb and flow of the tide," but on the "susceptibility to

"tidal" depends not on

12

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

And that is

1

commercial navigation."

2

the doctrine, that is, to preserve the highways of commerce.

3

QUESTION:

And that is the whole reason behind

But that was not the reason.

That was not

4

the sole reason at common law, Mr. Gressman.

5

sorts of things that attached — in particular, fishing rights,

6

whether it was navigable or not -- the fishing rights in ebb

7

and flow waters belonged to the king, and not to private

8

owners.

9

MR. GRESSMAN:

There were all

No, Your Honor, the English common

10

law, going back as far as 1604, in the River Banne case -- and

11

that has never been questioned in subsequent cases as far as I

12

know -- stated that there is a clear distinction between a

13

navigable water and a non-navigable stream.

14

owns and controls the navigable waters, but the non-navigable

15

waters are subject to private riparian ownership, and that has

16

been the history of the common law in this country.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. GRESSMAN:

19
20

And that the king

Even if the tide reaches them?
I would say "yes, if it is not

navigable by virtue of the tide reaching them."
QUESTION:

But if you read Chief Justice Taney's

21

Opinion in Genesee Chief, you get the impression that at least

22

that Court thought that navigability and tidal characters were

23

coterminous in England.

24

MR. GRESSMAN:

25

Well, they were because of the

peculiar geography of England -- such a small country that all

Heritage

1

this was set forth, explained not only in Genesee Chief, but

2

down through the years and Illinois Central repeats this

3

history again -QUESTION:

4

But then you never would get a situation

5

in England where the river was navigable but non-tidal, or

6

tidal but non-navigable.

7

MR. GRESSMAN:

Possibly not, but that was -- that

8

situation did not exist in this country.

I mean, it was an

9

entirely different situation, because here, as I used in the

10

Mississippi River example.

11

that is both tidal and navigable.

12

influence, you have waters that are not subject to the tide.

13

QUESTION:

You have a certain portion of it
Whereas above the tidal

Yes, but what I am uncertain about is how

14

good an authority your River Banne case in England is in 1604?

15

Which simply is applying the "public trust" doctrine in England

16

where the two were really coterminous?

17

MR. GRESSMAN:

Well, even in England, I suppose there

18

are little streams -- discrete little steams -- tributaries,

19

that are not navigable.

20

mean, they can -- Nature makes these large, navigable bodies of

21

water by having a series of discrete, little streams and

22

rivers.

23

common law cases, that it is these discrete, little streams and

24

rivers that do not pass through the control of the Crown, but

25

they are reserved for the private riparian landowner, and that

I mean, that is the way Nature is.

I

And that reference appears in a lot of the early

has been the history in this country.
The little streams that run through farmlands, or

somebody's back yard; a little creek -- that is not subject to

4

state control.

5

rises to the level of navigability.

And if it just happens to have -- unless it

Navigability is the one criterion that is

6

7

consistently referred to as the test of the "public trust"

doctrine.
I wish to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.

doctrines together.

The State of Mississippi's main concern is to

preserve the ownership of the lands in question for the use and

benefit of the public and this, by necessity, included the

properties in question remained unchallenged until these leases

issue that the payment of taxes was not at issue in this case

purported to cover the lands in question?

deeds -- in the nature of quitclaim deeds, by Acts of Congress.

leases?
