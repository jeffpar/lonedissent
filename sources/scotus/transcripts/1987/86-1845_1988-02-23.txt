ORAL ARGUMENT OF B.V. YTURBIDE, ESO.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. YTURBIDE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

11

the Court, I am frank to say to the Court at the outset that

12

I am here todav with mixed emotions, thrilled, of course,

13

after some 35 years of practice to have at least the oooor-

14

tun:i ty to appear at our judicial summit, but saddened, too,

15

at least chagrined by the irony that this certainly for me

16

the most memorable appearance in my career should be basicallv

17

traceable to a lapse in my office marking one of the low points

18

of my career, perhaps, the very nadir of it, or close to it.

19

The Court will recall that contrary to intention,

20

throuah inadvertence, Jose Torres, one of 16 Hispanic and

21

Black persons intervening as plaintiffs in a potential class

22

action for emplovment dniscrinination,was not specifically

23

named along with the rest, and a notice of appeal from a

24

It was not a theoretical thincr of the future.
QUESTION:

He didn't exnose himself to any oossible

sanctions as a result of his anneal —

MF. YTURBIDE:

S

QUESTION:

6

MR. YTURBIDE:

No.

— because he wasn't named as a narty.
But I think on balance that that

7

would hardly have been a serious matter.

8

he wanted to anpeal in any evefit, and would of course have

9

been willing to expose himself to the sanctions .

10

theoretical

11

actually he didn't want to get into the appeal and it was mv

12

idea and I engineered it and dragged him in by the heels, and

13

he would have been fearful of the costs and so forth he would

14

have incurred.

15

The fact is that

There is some

discussion by my opponent to the effect that

Whv, that is contrary to the only showing that was

16

made on the motion for summary judgment.

17

below, and certainly realistically he was already exposed to

18

that, and perhaps the greater danger on balance would have

19

been that the erroneous dissmisal by becoming final would

20

expose him to that problem.

21

QUESTION:

It was uncontroverted

Mr. Yturbide, suppose the same thing

22

had happened, the same clerical error in omitting the name

23

of one of the plaintiffs at the- comolaint stage, and you

24

could show the same thing as. here, that this individual was

really meant to be included, and. it was purelv a clerical

MR. YTURBIDE:

I believe that the matter would be

3

somewhat different.

4

complaint is what begins an

S

but in point of fact, as has been belatedly noted in this

6

matter by my opponent even in this proceeding for the first

7

time, I think that the caption of the complaint did not in

8

fact list Mr. Torres’s name, even in the complaint in

9

intervention, although the alleaations in the body did list

10

him among the others.

11

We have to face realistically that the
entire aspect of litigation,

Once you have a complaint that starts the litigation

12

then it seems to me that everything that happens after that

13

is in a different category than the complaint itself.

QUESTION:

But the Court of 'Appeals has separate

20

MR. YTURBIDE:

Fvervthing that the District

It is a jurisdictional

Well, of course, that’s the theory,

21

and that is part of the reason, I suppose, that we are here

22

all tocrether today, is to see whether or not that is or is

23

not a jurisdictional act in this kind of context where at

24

least you have someone who has instituted the notice of

25

appeal with reference to the subject matter that is of common

here identically situated below. That is different than the

3

picture presented by the complaint.

4

of picture that this Court's own Rule 10.4-seems to contemplate,

S

and that is that once you have a notice of appeal by someone

6

before this Court, then this Court's own rule, contrary to any

7

jurisdictional concept with respect to unspecified persons is

8

automatically all parties below are included as parties.

9

QUESTION:

who were similarly situated,

That is indeed the kind

Yes, but you weren't petitioning for

10

certiorari, Mr. Yturb.ide.

11

Court to- the Court of Appeals, which is governed by the

12

Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.

13

MR. YTURBIDE:

You were appealing from the District

Well, 10.4 is an appellate rule,

14

Your Honor, as 19.6 is the certiorari one.

15

we were confronting Rule 3(c) of the Federal Rules of

16

Appellate Procedure, but one of the points, of course, that

17

jangles in what has happened below is that a jurisdictional

18

rigid application of the appellant specification requirement

19

in Rule 3(c) is in clash with the policy reflected in 10.4

20

and for that matter 19.6 of this Court's own rules.

21

Yes, of course,

I think that one of the services that this Court

22

can render at this time is to not only comment upon that

23

clash and attempt to resolve it but perhaps beyo.nd

There is no speicifc one.

I think

12

what the courts that have been inclined to adopt what we

13

regard as the unfortunate strict jurisdictional view certainly

14

seem to contemplate even within the confines of that juris­

15

dictional view that amendment can occur at least within the

limited time restrictions provided for filinq a notice in

the first instance, which under Rule 4A presumably would be

within that time, then none would be possible.

To say ootentially there were is to say

MR. YTURBIDE:

Potentially there were,

Oh, I think that there is authority

for the proposition that even in the absence of certification

8

there is representative effect to what potential representa­

9

tives do.

10
11

I think that is the case we have cited in our

brief. The United States against McDonald recognizes that.
The Romasanta- case recognizes that.

If indeed, if there

12

couldn’t be reDresentative effect for appellate purposes, a

13

denial of class action certification could not itself ever be

14

appealed by anyone on behalf of the class.

So obviously

the status in which it

is another of those areas where characterization can seeminglv

2

make a difference.

3

is no difference in that possible difference in phraseology.

4

The fact remains that there is a benefit of the appeal for the

5

people who are not specified in'the notice of appeal any more

6

than Mr. Torres was.

7

I would suggest that in substance there

These people would get the benefit of that appeal for

11

I think that the point that we have to keep in mind

12

in this area is, I think, the pre-eminent, paramount in

13

importance to the wholesomeness of the judicial system is

14

It was said, "We have discretion where the interests

That is a commendable utterance, one that is in conformity

21

with inherent power and to do justice and certainly that is

22

something which we have occasion in this Court to give impetus

to again and I think should be in the context which is in such

8

reject the approach that pleading, even if we call, in con­

formity with the orior question, even if we call the notice of

11

game of skill in which one misstep by counsel may be decisive

12

to the outcome and accept the principle that the purpose of

13

pleading is to facilitiate a proper decision on the merits.

14

The Federal Rules

Years even before that Justice Black in ordering

15

adoption of the revised decisions of this Court, rules of this

perhaps just as eloquently when he said ,,rnhe function of

Oakland Scavenger Company noted that failure to file a notice

5

Mr. Torres's status was left somewhat indefinite

by virtue of the fact that counsel had not responded to the

8

fact that only 15 of the original 15 plaintiffs had appealed

when it issued its decision.

10

District Court in a status conference statement that a motion

for summary judgment would be filed seeking to have the

or better than a year prior to the filing of a petition for

the Court.

5

The Ninth circuit upheld the District Court's de­

6

cision, and Mr. Torres's petition for writ of certiorari from

7

that decision was timely, but it appears that his petition

8

from denial of the recall of mandate was not timely, and that

9

matter should not currently be before the Court.

10

a difference because if the only matter which the Court is

11

currently considering is the summary judgment issued by the

12

District Court, then it would appear that the District Court's

13

ruling was undeniably correct, the District Court did not have

So the issues before the Court are whether the

District Court correctly decided that it did not have authority

to amend the notice, whether the petition for writ of

20

certiorari from the denial of the motion for recall of mandate

21

was timely, and then, and only if the Court finds that that

abused its discretion in denvina the recall of mandate some

Counsel had argued

for a representative effect,

suggesting that if any party, that is, any appealing party in

for that position in the rules or in the decisional law.

rule, that is, Rule 3 expressly states that the notice of

appeal shall specify the party or parties who are filing the

and suggests that if there is more than one appealing party

12

they may file singly or they may file separately, but as

or excusable neglect.

Foman was concerned with an appeal

2

which — or two notices of appeal which were filed following

3

a judgment, one filed within the time, the correct time

4

following a judament, but which was premature because there

5

was a post-judgment motion to vacate the judgment pending, and

6

so the time for filing in Foman was tolled by that motion.
There was also a subsequent notice filed following

7

8

the decision on the post-judgment motion which itself was

9

timely but which did not mention the earlier judgment, and this

10

Court ruled that the two notices taken together could be

11

taken as a single notice that there was a manifest intent

12

on the part of'the appellant to file an appeal, not simply of

13

the denial of the post-judgment motion, but also of the

14

judgment.

15

But in this case, there was no reaction at all to

the note in the brief stating that Jose Torres had not filed

17

a notice of appeal and that he was not listed as a party

interested in the outcome of the action.

from would seem to have any application in this particular

case.

3

There also does not appear to have been any

4

excusable oversight which would justify an equitable kind of

5

relief if the Court had authority to grant that.

6

in the Ninth Circuit has been clear, at least since 1960,

7

as a result of the Cook and Sons case, that everv party

8

appealing must be named in the notice of appeal, and that

9

parties who are omitted from the notice of appeal will not

10

be considered to be nartic.ipating.

The standard

11

In this particular case counsel has stated in his

12

brief to this Court that the decision to take no action was

13

deliberate, that in balancing the risks of bringing the matter

14

to the Court's attention he made a determination that it would

not be in his client's best interest do to so, and he states

16

that he feared that there was a danger that the attempted

17

change, that is, a change in the notice would be perceived

18

or regarded as a self-confession of his failure to comply with

19

the court rules.

20

The problem with an indefinite standard, contrary

21

to the standard which has been and consistently has been

22

applied in the Ninth Circuit is that it shifts the burden

23

from the appellant to the appellee to make a determination as

24
