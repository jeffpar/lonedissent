ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD C. HOMER, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

8

MR. HOMER:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.
The issue before this Court is whether the Secretary

11
12

of Health and Human Services can deny Medicare providers a

13

hearing with respect to the amount of malpractice premium cost

14

they are reimbursed under his regulations on the grounds that

15

they followed those regulations when completing their cost

16

reports.

17

Petitioners Bethesda and Deaconess provided service

18

to Medicare beneficiaries and should not be denied the right to

19

challenge how those services are reimbursed simply because they

20

followed the Secretary's regulations in completing their cost

21

reports.

22

After listing their malpractice premium costs in the

23

cost report, Bethesda and Deaconess had three options available

24

to them when the apportioned those costs between Medicare and

25

non-Medicare patients.

Heritage

3

(202) 628-4888

1

First option.

They could do as they did and complete

2

the cost report in accordance with the malpractice regulation

3

and submit it to the intermediary. The Secretary that says

4

compliance with his Regulation is not an acceptable option if

5

one is to challenge that regulation before the Provider

6

Reimbursement Review Board.

7

Second option.

They could decline to follow the

8

Secretary's regulation and apportion the cost contrary to

9

regulation and submit it to the intermediary.

The Secretary

10

says through an informal policy that has been adopted that this

11

is what they should have done if they wanted to challenge the

12

regulation.

13

Third option.

They could apportion their malpractice

14

premium costs in accordance with the regulation, submit the

15

cost report to the intermediary with a cover letter indicating

16

they wanted to challenge the malpractice regulation.

17

this is not the process that the Secretary claims to be

18

necessary for the Provider Reimbursement Review Board, which

19

I'll refer to as the PRRB, to entertain such a challenge, he

20

concedes that it is an available option.

21

While

Now, the only difference between the first option,

22

which is what we did, completing in accordance with the

23

regulation and submitting it to the intermediary, and the third

24

option, completing in accordance with the regulation and

25

submitting with the cover letter indicating a general

4

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1
2

dissatisfaction or desire to challenge the regulation.
I'd like to comment first on this second option,

3

apportioning costs contrary to regulation.

4

contends such a requirement should be read into subparagraph

5

(a)(1)(A) of subsection 139500.

6

The Secretary

Now, there is a practical consideration here that has

7

not been mentioned in the briefs, and that is by filing costs

8

contrary to regulations, providers run a risk of the

9

intermediary not accepting the cost report.

Subparagraphs

10

(a)(1)(B) and (a)(1)(C) provide that the intermediary cannot be

11

required to render a final determination or forced to proceed

12

with a final determination of the cost of the reimbursement due

13

unless the cost reports comply with the Secretary's

14

regulations.

15

And also with regard to the second option, no purpose

16

is served by filing out of compliance with the regulations. The

17

intermediary cannot give relief.

18

contract to audit the cost report and bring it into compliance

19

with regulations.

20

The intermediary's bound by

When the question is the substance of the regulation,

21

the dispute is with the Secretary, not the intermediary.

22

Filing out of compliance does nothing more than create

23

additional work for the intermediary who must now issue an

24

audited adjustment and conform the cost report so that it

25

complies with the regulations, redoing the calculations.

Heritage

QUESTION:

1

I would assume though that the

2

intermediary could reallocate the claimed costs under some

3

other category that was permissible.

4

for malpractice, it might find a way to give you $8,000 or

5

$9,000 of those costs under some other category.

If you claimed $15,000

6

MR. HOMER:

7

If we have something that's by definition a

No, that's not correct, Your Honor.

8

malpractice cost, then it must be allocated in accordance with

9

the malpractice regulation.

10

QUESTION:

But aren't there cases where it's

11

difficult to characterize costs, or there's some question as to

12

their proper characterization?

13

MR. HOMER:

14
15

Oh, there are cases in those instances

but that's not what we're talking about today.
QUESTION:

Well, insofar as the rule is concerned,

16

might not there be instances where how to characterize a cost

17

is open to question and so it serves a purpose to submit the

18

issue to the fiscal intermediary for its determination as to

19

allocation?

20

MR. HOMER:

The fiscal intermediary is required and

21

they spend about 300 hours on a medium to large hospital doing

22

the audit of the cost report, and they are required to look at

23

each and every cost and determine how it is to be allocated

24

under the regulations.

25

instance where that would be the case.

There may be, as you indicate, an

instance.

4

favor.

5

when they do the audit to issue an audit adjustment in the

6

provider's favor, bringing that allocation into conformity with

7

the regulations.

advantage of the mistakes in the Government's favor and then go

9

forward with the regulations.

10

Let's said that we made an error in the filing of

But it's not something where they take

Let's go further and say the intermediary missed that

11

and there's no intermediary action or audit adjustment.

12

the provider have a right to a hearing?

13

should. Because the first time the provider gets to the

14

Government agency with a complaint that they didn't get paid

15

what they should have for their services is when they go to the

16

Provider Reimbursement Review Board.

17

Should

And certainly they

The cost report stops with the intermediary.

It does

18

not go on to the Agency unless it is appealed to the Provider

19

Reimbursement Review Board.

20

And I had mentioned, there is no purpose served by

21

filing out of compliance.

And if, in this instance, the

22

Secretary felt that there was a purpose, they wanted some early

23

warning of an intent to challenge the regulation, in this

24

particular case, these providers had already challenged that

25

regulation in the Hadley litigation in the Tenth Circuit and

7

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1

had been told they had to go to the PRRB, only to be tripped up

2

by this informal policy with regard to how the cost report is

3

to be completed.

4

With regard to the third option, that is, filing the

5

cost report in accordance with regulation but attaching a cover

6

letter saying you want to challenge the regulation.

7

option serves no purpose at either the audit process level or

8

at the Provider Reimbursement Review Board.

9

is not a part of the cost report.

10
11

This

The cover letter

It does not generate any

intermediary action and it generates no intermediary comment.
When the intermediary renders its final determination

12

of total program reimbursement due, there is no substantive

13

difference between what we did, filing in compliance with the

14

regulation, and the third option that the Secretary has

15

conceded will be a basis for jurisdiction, that is, filing in

16

compliance and attaching a cover note saying, I would like to

17

challenge the regulation.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. HOMER:

Were you aware that that was an option?
It's not clear at the time these cost

20

reports were filed whether these particular hospitals, I

21

believe they may have been aware of that option, but they may

22

not have determined that they wanted to continue with this

23

litigation at that point.

24

25

AFTERNOON

1

SESSION
(1:00 p.m.)

2

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

3
4

Mr. Homer, you may

continue.

5

MR. HOMER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

6

I would like to continue by clarifying a point that

7

was made by Justice O'Connor and that is the fact that indeed

8

we did ask for reimbursement of malpractice premium costs.

9

entered those in the cost report and then apportioned them in

We

10

accordance with the regulation requiring them to be apportioned

11

in the manner we did, and then proceeded before the Provider

12

Reimbursement Review Board to ask for a hearing once we got our

13

notice of program reimbursement.

14

Now, the Secretary claims that filing the cost report

15

or entering costs in non-compliance with the regulation or out

16

of conformity with the regulation is something required by

17

subparagraph (a)(1)(A) of the Statute.

18

and Deaconess forfeited their right to a hearing by following

19

his regulations when they completed their cost report.

20

He says that Bethesda

Now, subparagraph (a)(1)(A) of 139500 sets forth when

21

providers have a right to proceed to a hearing before the

22

Provider Reimbursement Review Board.

23

may proceed to a hearing if, and I will quote, "if the provider

24

is dissatisfied with a final determination of its fiscal

25

intermediary as to the amount of total program reimbursement

It says that the provider

10

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1
2

do. "
The Secretary asks this Court to rewrite subparagraph

3

(a)(1)(A) so that it reads, "the provider may obtain a hearing

4

only if dissatisfied with the intermediary's disallowance of

5

costs entered in the cost report and then submitted to the

6

intermediary."

7

The foundation or core of the Secretary's argument

8

that one must file contrary to regulation to generate the

9

intermediary adjustment is his characterization of the cost

10

reporting and audit process as an adjudicative process in which

11

the intermediary is both adversary and tribunal.

12

you'll keep in mind, the Secretary has conceded that a cover

13

letter attached to a cost report that is filed in compliance

14

with the regulation will suffice for jurisdiction.

15

However, if

And as I mentioned, the cover note is not part of the

16

cost report.

19

purported need for an adjudicative process during the audit.

20

It generates no intermediary action or comment

QUESTION:

Indeed, it does not

I suppose if the Statute were clear, it

21

really wouldn't make any difference whether it served any

22

purpose or not.

23

to have it considered and you have to make this claim to have

24

it considered, that's that, isn't it?

25

If Congress says you have to file this report

MR. HOMER:

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

11

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

The Statute is clear, however.

1

The Statute says

2

under Section 139500(a), you have to file the cost report and

3

that you have to file a claim within 180 days after you've

4

received your notice of program reimbursement if you're

5

dissatisfied with the total amount of reimbursement received.

6

It doesn't say, if you're dissatisfied with an intermediary

7

adjustment.

8

and that's the bottom line, how much we got for our services.

It says, total amount of reimbursement received,

is the pre-1979 regulation, which is based on utilization.

this very group appeal filed it as the Secretary suggested out

6

of conformity with regulations three years in a row and then

7

slipped up the fourth year because they followed directions.

8

It's a trap for the unwary.

9

And the point is, I believe, that the Secretary has

10

no authority to impose that condition precedent at the cost

11

reporting level.

12

under subsection (a) of 139500 is to set the time within which

13

cost reports may be filed.

QUESTION:

MR. HOMER:

Yes, I think there is an analogy.
I think so, too.
What I should say with regard to the

12

Secretary's position on his concession as to the sufficiency of

13

a cover letter being a basis for PRRB jurisdiction is that when

14

he conceded that, he conceded away his entire case.

15

The simple fact is that those cost reports are filed

16

in compliance with the regulation.

17

touch that cover letter.

18

QUESTION:

The intermediary does not

I wondered why he conceded that.

And you

19

know why I think he conceded it, Mr. Homer, is that if he

20

didn't, he thought he would be met with the argument that there

21

is a great loss for the hospital if it challenges the

22

regulation and does not follow the regulation in the report.

23

That is, if you read 139500(a)(1)(B) and (C).

If

24

it's not following the regulations, it cannot appeal when the

25

provider simply sits on the submission.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS, ESQ.

15

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. PINCUS:

16
17

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.

18

Despite petitioners' attempts to depict this case as

19

one that turns on the procedural peculiarities of the Medicare

20

reimbursement system, we think that the issue of statutory

21

interpretation that's presented here is neither novel nor

22

complex.

23

administrative law, which is whether claimant must exhaust its

24

administrative remedies in order to preserve its claim for

25

further review.

It's an issue that arises with some frequency in

19

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

Now, this Court and the lower Federal courts have

2

held in a variety of contexts that where Congress has

3

established a multi-tiered administrative process, a party must

4

exhaust its administrative remedies in order to obtain further

5

review of its claim.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Pincus, most administrative remedies

7

can give you relief.

8

administrative remedies, it means there's some administrator

9

who can provide you relief.

10

I mean, the very term, exhaust

But here the intermediary cannot provide you relief,

11

so how can you possibly call that an administrative remedy.

12

The administrator has to follow the regulation.

13

MR. PINCUS:

Well, Your Honor, we think that there

14

are two guestions presented in this case, and we rely by

15

analogy the way the Court has interpreted other exhaustion

16

requirements under other parts of the Social Security laws in

17

cases like Southland and Ringer.

18

In those cases, the Court has really applied a two

19

step process.

20

is a general exhaustion requirement in a run of the mill case,

21

a case in which the administrator can grant relief. And then

22

it's looked to see whether the facts of the case before it in

23

which the claimant is typically urging that exhaustion is not

24

necessary merit an exception from that general principle.

25

The Court has first looked to see whether there

And we think that's the proper way to analyze this

Heritage

20
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1
2

case.
Petitioners focus on the fact that this case involves

3

a reimbursement claim that rests on a challenge to a

4

regulation.

5

are a lot of cases raising this same issue in which there

6

wasn't a challenge to a regulation.

7

now pending before the Court on certiorari.

8
9
10

But it's still a reimbursement claim, and there

QUESTION:

Some of those cases are

But Mr. Pincus, what is your answer to

Justice Scalia's point that there was no administrative remedy?
Is that not correct in the facts of this case?

11

MR. PINCUS:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. PINCUS:

Well, on the â€”
That's a yes or no, I think.
Yes.

I think it is certainly true that

14

the intermediary could not award the relief that they sought.

15

But in Ringer the Court specifically said that exhaustion may

16

be required in a case where it appears to be futile.

17

example, it may be that a provider frames its claim for

18

reimbursement, the provider thinks that it depends on the

19

invalidation of the regulation.

20

it may turn out that reimbursement can be rewarded because the

21

provider is under a misapprehension about the scope of the

22

regulation, or because the reimbursement can be awarded under

23

some other theory, or it may turn out that the claim is barred

24

for some reason that the provider didn't recognize and so the

25

challenge to the regulation is moot.

Upon examination of the claim,

21
Heritage

For

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

And the Court recognized in Ringer that it is

1

2

appropriate to have an administrative entity that can't rule on

3

the precise claim look at those issues to apply its expertise

4

to make sure that what is in fact presented is a challenge to

5

the statute that the administrative entity can't resolve.

6

I think those rationales are equally applicable here.
QUESTION:

7

And

Mr. Pincus, why can we treat these

8

regulation cases differently from the other ones that you say

9

are lurking there in the wings to pounce upon us if we come out

10

this way on regulation?
I mean, certainly the statute treats regulations

11
12

differently.

13

provision.

14

when you don't receive a final determination from the

15

intermediary, except that you can't appeal if you haven't filed

16

your report in accordance with the rules and regulations of the

17

Secretary.

18
19
20

In (a)(1)(B) and (C), it does make a special
That is, you can't appeal unless you can appeal

Now, the statute treats that kind of an issue quite
differently from other issues.
MR. PINCUS:

Well, Your Honor, we don't think that

21

language has anything to do with a substantive claim.

22

the rules and regulations that those provisions are talking

23

about are the rules and regulations dealing with the form and

24

procedural requirements in preparing a cost report.

25

think it's a coincidence that this point is not discussed in

22

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

We think

We don't

1

the briefs or any of the appellate decisions raising the issue

2

because we think it is simply a non -- it doesn't have anything

3

to do with the substantive disagreement about the cost rules.

4

It has to do with the procedural rules.

5

And if a provider files a cost report applying a

6

substantive cost rule or not following a substantive cost rule,

7

we don't think that that provision applies and to our knowledge

8

it hasn't ever been applied to throw out a cost report.

9

And let me just go back to your question about why

10

there should not be a difference for claims based on challenges

11

to regulations.

12

given, which is that in many cases what a provider thinks to be

13

a challenge to a regulation may not be, we don't think there's

14

any basis in the Statute for making that distinction.

15

especially we look to subsection (F)(1) which is where Congress

16

created an expedited judicial review remedy to deal

17

specifically with cases resting on challenges to regulations.

In addition to the reasons that I've already

18

And what Congress did â€”

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. PINCUS:

21

22

And

Where will we find that?
That is on page 3 -- the relevant

language is on page 3(a) of our brief.
Prior to the amendment in 1980 that added the

23

language to which I'm about to refer, all claims had to be

24

brought to the PRRB and had to go through a formal hearing

25

before the PRRB, even challenges to regulations which the PRRB

23

(202) 628-4888

Like the intermediary, the PRRB is

2

bound by the Secretary's regulation.

3

Nonetheless, prior to the addition of this language,

4

a provider that was challenging a regulation had to bring that

5

reimbursement claim before the PRRB, had to have it heard by

6

the PRRB â€”
QUESTION:

7

When you said, this language, Mr. Pincus,

8

it's just a solid page.

9

you're referring to?
MR. PINCUS:

10

Is there any particular part of it

Well, let me â€” the language on which we

11

rely is excerpted maybe a little more clearly on the top of

that allowed a provider to bypass a Board hearing in these

cases.

QUESTION:

2

Is your interest in this case just to make

3

sure you follow the letter of the law, or do you, does the

4

Secretary really have some substantial reason for wanting this

5

to happen?
MR. PINCUS:

6

Well, Your Honor, the Secretary has very

7

substantial reasons for wanting this to happen.

8

recognized in a variety of cases that the exhaustion doctrine

9

rests upon a number of important policies, primarily the policy

1

of administrative efficiency.

11

administrative system.
QUESTION:

12

13

The Court has

And this is a very large

There are 15,

--

What is efficient about filing a useless

claim?

14

MR. PINCUS:

Well, Your Honor, as I said, there are

15

two categories of claims.

There are claims that are not

16

useless because they are claims for which relief can be granted

17

by the intermediary, and then there are claims which the

18

provider might think can only be granted by a Court.

19

But as to the first class of claims, we think it's

20

self-evident that there is great efficiency in having claims

21

that the intermediary may grant raised before the intermediary.

22

23
24
25

QUESTION:

What about the claim that's involved in

this case?
MR. PINCUS:

The type of claim that's involved in

this case we think there are also the important reasons that

Heritage

25
Reporting Corporation
(2 2) 628-4888

1

the Court has recognized in Ringer, which are while the

2

provider might think that the only way it can get relief is if

3

the regulation is overturned, it might be that the provider is

4

wrong about what the regulation means, and that if the claim

5

had been raised before the intermediary, the intermediary would

6

have interpreted the regulation to award relief.

7

Now, this regulation â€”

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes, but isn't it true that in Ringer

there was an express requirement the Statute spelled out what

10

had to be exhausted before you could get judicial review.

11

don't have that here.

12

MR. PINCUS:

You

It's a rather different statute.
Well, Your Honor, we think that in the

13

dissatisfaction language of subsection (A)(1) and in the

14

language that I've just referred to in the expedited judicial

15

review provision, Congress has made clear that there is a

16

similar exhaustion requirement here.

17
18

QUESTION:

Or at least you think it's clear enough to

justify your regulation??

19

MR. PINCUS:

We think it's clear, but if the Court

20

thinks it's ambiguous, we think that the Secretary's

21

interpretation is certainly reasonable and that the Court

22

should adopt it.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Has the Secretary been consistent in the

past?
MR. PINCUS:

Yes, Your Honor, in our view, the

Heritage

26
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

Secretary has consistently --

QUESTION:

3

MR. PINCUS:

The Amicus says he hasn't been.
Yes, and we explain in our brief in some

4

detail the argument on

5

to the argument that there has been some inconsistency.

6

Secretary has always required that in order to invoke the

7

Board's jurisdiction, the provider is only entitled to invoke

8

the Board's jurisdiction on a claim that it raised before the

9

intermediary.
QUESTION:

10

pages 35 and 36 of our brief, we respond

Well, does it do the Secretary any good to

make them file this claim?

get relief on some other basis?

QUESTION:

I thought it was also because â€” would the

intermediary ever look at the claim if it were filed?

19

The

MR. PINCUS:

Yes.

We think that the intermediaries

are obligated to look at the claims and they do.
QUESTION:

20

And I suppose, would the intermediary say,

21

well, this looks like a straightforward claim that is barred by

22

the regulation except we think it's too big, I mean, it's just

23

erroneous.

24
25

If there's a claim like this, it's only half this.
MR. PINCUS:

Well, Your Honor, the intermediary

certainly could say that even under the theory advanced by the

Heritage

27
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

provider that the claim is wrong.

2

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Pincus, do you think if all that

3

was done here was to attach a cover letter, that the cost

4

report filing was just as it was, but a little cover letter

5

were attached, that the intermediary would then go into the

6

merits of that and try to figure out some way to adjust the

7

amounts allowable to take account of it?

8

MR. PINCUS:

9

QUESTION:

10

Yes.
I mean it sounds like the cover letter the

intermediary isn't concerned with looking at it at all.
MR. PINCUS:

11

Well, the Secretary believes that part

12

of the intermediary's obligations are to look at things in

13

cover letters and to do the kind of evaluation to which I've

14

just referred.

We don't think that â€”

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. PINCUS:

Was there â€”
We think the cover letter option is

17

really for the convenience of the provider more than anything

18

else.

19

It's â€”
QUESTION:

Was there ever an express regulation

20

explaining that providers could file such a cover letter and it

21

would suffice?

22

MR. PINCUS:

This rule has evolved through cost

23

reimbursement decisions of the Board which are reviewed by the

24

Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration.

25

those decisions are reported in a widely distributed Reporter

28

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

And

1

that is certainly something with which members of the industry

2

are well informed.
We think it's important to realize in this case that

3
4

this is not similar to for example the disability area where

5

the claimants are individuals that might be poor and not well

6

counseled.

7

The providers in this case are large health care

8

institutions that have staffs devoted to complying with

9

Medicare regulations, have trade organizations that publicize

10

recent decisions and make sure their members are aware of what

11

the rules are and to which the members can go if they want

12

assistance in finding out what the regulations are.

13

We think when the Secretary issued decisions

14

embodying this regulation and let me add that the rule was

15

subsequently codified in a manual that is distributed to all

16

providers, we think that's enough to inform this class of

17

claimants about â€”

There was no Board.

There was no further review.

The provider filed its cost report, the intermediarymade the determinations, and that was the end of it unless the
Secretary chose to review the determination which did not
happen very frequently.
In turn, the providers were very dissatisfied with
the state of affairs because they had no way to challenge the
decisions of intermediaries which they were unhappy with.

And

They â€”
QUESTION:

Mr. Pincus, if you prevail here, will you

do so on a regulation that has been declared illegal?
MR. PINCUS:

Well, nothing about the exhaustion

requirement has been declared illegal, Your Honor.

And some

Courts have concluded that the substantive rule here, the
Medicare Malpractice Insurance Reimbursement Rule, has been
declared unlawful.

But we don't think the substantive claim

should influence the Court's determination of this important
procedural question.

a number of other courts of appeals have come out our way, and

we think that this is a very appropriate case if this Court or

7

This is the administrative scheme that the Secretary oversees

8

and we think that the Secretary has expertise in deciding what

Congress intended in order to have a properly functioning

10

process.
And so we think even if the statutory language is

MR. PINCUS:

20

For a different purpose.
â€” that's a possibility if the Court

disagrees with our principal submission.
But we think that there's no reason why the Board's

21

authority to decide to do that would be limited to the nonÂ­

22

regulation cases.

23

the policies that I've been discussing that also apply in a

24

situation where the intermediary might not have authority to

25

decide the claim on the ground that the provider is asserting,

The Board could well determine we think that

MR. PINCUS:

1

The first reported case that we were

2

able to find we discuss in a footnote on page 34 our brief.

3

list a number of the Board and administrative decisions

4

embodying this requirement and the first one that we list was

5

in 1977.

6

And that decision I'm not sure whether that decision

7

expressly gave â€” that decision I think referred to claiming

8

the cost, and I'm not sure whether it expressly defined the

options.

In subsequent decisions, the rule has been clarified.

We

And when was that issued?

1981.
The current version which makes

everything clear.
Let me turn back to the legislative history for a

21
22

moment because I think that the legislative history really

23

illuminates what Congress was trying to do when it created the

24

PRRB.

25

As I was saying, the Board was created in response to

Heritage

37
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

complaints of providers who were dissatisfied with their

2

intermediaries determinations, and more particularly

3

dissatisfied with the fact that they had no where to contest

4

the determinations that intermediaries made.

5

And the legislative history is quite explicit that

6

filled with those complaints and Congress made clear when it

7

created the Board that it was doing so in response in order to

8

create a forum for resolution of those disputed issues.

9

^

And we think the fact that Congress was focusing on

10

that illuminates the dissatisfaction requirement and makes

11

clear that what Congress was doing was creating a body designed

12

to review disputed intermediary determinations.

13

for the determination to be disputed, it's got to be raised

14

before the intermediary.

15

And in order

And let me just return one more time to the question

16

of why exhaustion makes sense in this situation.

17

reimbursement, I think the regulatory challenge in this case

18

may be somewhat deceptive in terms of the way the Secretary's

19

cost reimbursement regulations are written.

20

The cost

In this case, the question is just what percentage of

21

medical malpractice insurance costs are going to be allocated

22

to the Medicare program and just reimbursable.

23

the Regulations may contain more flexible definitions of

24

whether a cost is reimbursable, what the standard is for

25

reimbursement.

Heritage

38
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

In other cases,

For example, the Secretary treats differently

1
2

transactions between related entities, and the definition of

3

whether an entity is related is of course there are standards

4

set out in the regulations but those standards are somewhat

5

flexible in application.

6

really always just a claim for reimbursement.

7

that the provider places a particular label on the basis for

8

its legal challenge to the claim may not be determinative of

9

how the claim is resolved.

And so it may, a providers claim is
And the fact

So we think it is deceptive to say, this is a

10
11

regulation challenge so we can put it in this box.

12

is really, is just a claim for more money, and the provider

13

presumably will be happy to get the money on any basis that it

14

can.

15

will have some flexibility in them.

16

intermediary should be allowed to determine in the first

17

instance, or given the opportunity to determine in the first

18

instance, whether the regulation covers the particular

19

situation.

20

What this

And frequently, the regulations that govern that question
And we think that the

And that way, the question as it goes to the Board

21

will be illuminated, and perhaps the claim will be resolved

22

without any need to resolve the challenge to the regulation.

23

Similarly, the intermediary may find that the

24

particular regulation that the provider wants to challenge is

25

inapplicable for some completely unrelated reason that the

39

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

provider didn't realize or didn't want to bring to anyone's

2

attention at the time.

3

And we think because of the complexity of the

4

situation, it's just not possible to pigeon-hole a claim as a

5

regulation challenge claim and automatically give that some

6

exemption from the exhaustion requirement.

7

reimbursement issues are complex and we think that the better

8

course is to allow exhaustion in all circumstances so that the

9

intermediary which has expertise in dealing with the claim has

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD C. HOMER, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS - REBUTTAL

18

MR. HOMER:

Let me first focus on the issue of

19

dissatisfaction.

20

21

And what it seems to boil down to is when we

The statute says we are to be dissatisfied when we

22

learn what our total reimbursement is at the time the-

23

intermediary makes its final determination.

24
25

The Secretary says, no, we're to be dissatisfied and
express that dissatisfaction when we file the cost report.

40

Heritage

Corporation

628-4888

Now, what's to stop the Secretary from moving that back further
and saying, no, when you signed up as a provider, you knew what
the regulations were and you should have attached an addendum
to your provider agreement saying your dissatisfied with these
regulations.

Otherwise, we're not going to hear a challenge to

the regulation.
The difficult area that is being presented to you is
the fact that the cost report and audit process is being
presented to you by the Secretary as an adversary process.

The

Secretary relies on notions of exhaustion.
It is not a remedy when I hand you a bill of costs
for the services I've rendered and say, pay me under your
contract.

The remedy aspect of it doesn't start until you

short change me.

And that is what has happened under this

regulation.
The Secretary has short changed us and we -QUESTION:

Are you saying there's no decisional

process going on within the Board before they short change you,
as you put it?
MR. HOMER:

don't even go to the Board.

QUESTION:

5
6

Well, how about a decisional process of

the intermediary?

7

MR. HOMER:

At the audit level, there is a process by

8

which the intermediary takes the costs that have been entered

9

in the cost report and reviews them to assure that the costs

10

were indeed incurred, and that they have been treated by the

11

provider in accordance with the regulations.

QUESTION:

I do.

I do just have one additional

question.
On the alternative basis that the Government urges,

17

why isn't it the case that the Government can acknowledge that

18

there was jurisdiction to appear before the Board, but simply

say, we accepted jurisdiction and as a matter of sound practice

we are simply not going to allow a claim that you didn't raise

22

What's the matter with that?

into the language of the Statute at all.

that is one of the arguments made under subsection (D) which
