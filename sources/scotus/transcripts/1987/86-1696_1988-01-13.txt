ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD J. LAZARUS

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. LAZARUS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This case on writ certiorari to the United States

10

Court of Appeals for the Second Tenth Circuit concerns the

11

timeliness of a charge filed with the EEOC pursuant to Title

12

VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

13

Office Products Company, has refused to comply with an

14

administrative subpoena issued by the EEOC pursuant to Title

15

VII on the ground that the underlying discrimination charge was

16

not timely filed with the Commission.

17

Respondent, Commercial

Whether the charge was timely filed depends on the

18

answers to two different questions.

19

the charge first filed with the EEOC; and second, what were the

20

applicable statue limitations under Title VII, with respect to

21

this particular charge?

22

First, on what date was

The answers to these two questions, in turn, depend

23

on the meaning of two related provisions of Title VII,

24

paragraphs C and E of Section 70fi

25

provides that where there are federal and state agencies with

Heritage

The first, Section 706(c)

Reporting Corporation

overlapping jurisdictions to remedy a certain employment

2

discrimination practice, a charge alleging such a practice can

3

not be filed with the EEOC until sixty days after state

4

proceedings have commenced, unless such proceedings have

5

earlier terminated.

6

The second provision, Section 706(e) provides that

7

the normal 180-day federal limitations period does not apply in

8

that circumstance.

9

EEOC within 300 days of the alleged discriminatory practice, or

Instead, the charge must be filed with the

10

within thirty days of the termination of state proceedings,

11

whichever is earlier.

12

13
14

The timeliness of the charge in this case depends on
the application of these two provisions to the following facts?
The individual complainant in this case submitted a

15

charge to the EEOC in which she alleged that 290 days earlier,

16

the Respondent, Commercial Office Products, had discharged her

17

from appointment on account of her sex.

18

accepted the charge for filing.

19

Civil Rights Division declined initially to process the charge,

20

and wanted the EEOC immediately to act on the charge instead.

21

The state agency notified the EEOC of its intention

The EEOC subsequently

Upon determining, the Colorado

22

in three different ways.

previously entered into a work-sharing agreement with the EEOC

24

in which the state a greed in advance that these procedures

25

would be followed with respect to a charge such as this one,

Heritage

First, the Colorado Agency had

when it was first received by the EEOC.
Second, the EEOC contacted the state agency on the

2

3

day that it first received the charge, and on that day received

4

oral confirmation that these procedures should be followed with

5

respect to the charge.
Third, pursuant to the work-sharing agreement, the

6

7

EEOC sent a copy of the charge to the state agency along with a

8

transmittal form.

9

charge.

That was four days after it received the

Five days after that, the state agency sent a copy of

10

that transmittal form back to the EEOC, on which it indicated

11

that it declined to initially process the charge.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. LAZARUS:

14

What did they indicate?
That they declined to initially process

the charge.

15

QUESTION:

Is that all they said?

16

MR. LAZARUS:

17

QUESTION:

That's all it said on that form.

But didn't they simultaneously say they

18

postponed, or might consider it later, or something like that?

19

The big issue in this case is whether that was the termination

20

of the state proceeding.
MR. LAZARUS:

21

22

That's the critical issue.
Well, pursuant to the work-sharing

agreement, they reserved the jurisdiction --

23

QUESTION:

They reserved jurisdiction; that was their

24

language?

25

was a termination within the meaning of 706(e)?

And your basic position is that nevertheless, that

Precisely.

argument, but they both concluded that the charge had not been

filed with the EEOC within that 300 days because the 60-day

deferral period of Section 706(e) took it outside the 300 days.

The District Court agreed with Respondent that under

MR. LAZARUS:

They both rejected our contention that

there had been a termination prior to that.
QUESTION:

And you say that there is a termination,

13

even though the case is going to go back to that State

14

Commission?

We say there is a termination even

it wants, to act after the EEOC has acted.

no reason that it should.
QUESTION:

4

Well, ordinarily, "termination" means

"end," doesn't it?
MR. LAZARUS:

5

Well, the word "termination" — and

6

that's where we disagree with Respondent -- we don't believe

7

that "end" must be a permanent —
QUESTION:

"Terminus" is a Latin word that means

"end."

It means the end, but it does not

Something can have many ends.

MR. LAZARUS:

2

QUESTION:

Well, that's right.

But when something ceases temporarily, you

3

ordinarily would say it's "suspended."

4

it was "terminated."
MR. LAZARUS:

5

You wouldn't say that

That is right.

But the word

"termination" includes both a suspension, as in a case such as

this one, and a final disposition.

That word is consistent with the purposes

It sounds like it didn't even terminate.

It didn't even commence, did it?

MR. LAZARUS:

Well, it did commence.

How did it commence?

5

Appeals, which relied on its ruling that there can not be

surrendering of jurisdiction was incorrect.

8

that there is equally no merit to Respondent's ultimate

9

contention, and that is that their 300-day limitation period

We also believe

10

does not apply in the first instance in this case because the

11

charge was not timely filed with the state agency as a matter

12

of state law.

13

Turning to the First, the decision of the Court of

14

Appeals misconstrues, we believe, the meaning and purpose of

15

the deferral requirement established by Section 706(c).

16

Court of Appeals when under its reading of termination requires

17

state abdication authority instead of deference to state

18

authority, and would invite needless sixty-day delays instead

19

of promoting expeditious processing of claims.

The

20

Indeed, the decision threatens to undermine the

21

operation of the harmonious and efficient and cooperative

22

relationship now existing between federal and state agencies,

23

and precisely the relationship that Congress hoped to foster in

24

enacting Title VII, and whj.rh now exists thanks to the

25

work-sharing agreements.

QUESTION:

9

You say this is very harmonious, but under

10

it the federal government's doing an awful lot of the

11

processing rather than the states.
MR. LAZARUS:

12

To the extent that the federal

13

government is doing some of the processing, it is pursuant to

14

the agreement that the states have the upper hand in

15

voluntarily entering into these agreements.
QUESTION:

16

The states --

But Congress may have been worried about

17

that, about the

18

the work as possible onto the federal government.

19

nothing inconsistent with the Congress wanting to prevent the

20

states, even if they wanted to, from chucking off so much of

that work.

time, or indeed, that to take advantage of an efficient work­

It's really contrary and perverse to the

6

Congressional purpose to assume that Congress was somehow

not a stick.

10

We think that instead they were

The procedural requirements of the two provisions, of

11

paragraphs (c) and (e) of Section 706, are uncommonly complex.

12

They are the product, we admit, of a hard-fought compromise

13

fashioned by Senators Dirksen and Mansfield in order to

14

overcome a filibuster that threatened the passage of the Civil

15

Rights Act of 1964.

the statutory language are evident throughout the legislative

17

debates, and they are principally two.

The competing policy concerns reflected in

First, on the one hand, there were those such as

19

Senator Dirksen who wanted to insure that state agencies had a

20

meaningful opportunity to address appointment discriminations

at the local level.

did not want the force of a federal non-discrimination remedy

The Claimant never went there.
That's right.

It was referred by the EEOC, and after the

state's statute of limitations had expired.

Yes, I will.

(202) 628-4888

13

We believe, consistent with this Court's decision in

1
2

Oscar Mayer, that there only have to be two things for there to

3

be a state deferral agency within the meaning of Section 706(c)

4

to require that that deferral take place.

5

One --

6

QUESTION:

7

that qualify?
MR. LAZARUS:

Do all fifty states have state agencies

I believe there are a handful — four

or five that do not.

10

QUESTION:

That still do not?

11

MR. LAZARUS:

12

QUESTION:

Right, that still do not.

Well, the effect of your position is for

13

all the states that do to convert the 180-day time limit, plus

14

the sixty days, into a 300-day time limit.

15

MR. LAZARUS:

That's the effect.

Well, unless the state agency

16

terminates the proceedings prior to the 270 days, in which case

17

it would be the thirty days --

18

QUESTION:

But that's what you're really asking us

19

to do.

20

say, "Well, we're going to have a 300-day time limit," if

21

that's what they intended?

22

Wouldn't it have been a lot easier for Congress to just

MR. LAZARUS:

No, Congress has gotten exactly what

23

they wanted.

Congress provided for an extended limitations

24

period when there was a state deferral agency.

question is whether there is such an agency.

11

QUESTION:

In this case there wasn't a state agency

that could entertain it when it was referred.

13

MR. LAZARUS:

14

QUESTION:

15

Well, yes, there was.

You mean that the agency can just waive

the time limit if it wants to?
MR. LAZARUS:

16

Well, as the Court of Appeals

17

concluded, and we don't resist that conclusion here, the state

18

limitations period is not self-executing, and it is subject to

19

waiver.

20

purpose of the deferral requirement is to allow the state

21

agency for itself to decide what is the impact for the failure

to meet a limitation period — not to have the federal agency

3

QUESTION:

Well, it certainly isn't always black and

white, either, is it?
MR. LAZARUS:

As it isn't in this case.

As the Court

4

of Appeals found that there was jurisdiction, and that

5

therefore there was residual jurisdiction, and no termination.

6

Senator Dirksen and others —

7

QUESTION:

There is certainly something to be said

8

for your argument that you don't want a federal agency to be

9

deciding these state-law questions.

10

MR. LAZARUS:

That's right.

Senator Dirksen and

11

these others objected vehemently to the prior version of the

12

bill, which would have had the federal government investigating

13

and deciding whether or not there was an effective state law,

14

and an effective state agency.

15

The prior purpose of deferral, and the deferral

16

requirement, Section 706(c) was to avoid that situation.

17

Respondent invites the federal government to undertake just

18

such an intrusive inquiry to determine whether or not there is

19

still a state agency, because the limitation period is not met.

20

That varies widely among the states upon what is the

21

significance of a charge not being untimely, and whether or not

22

it is in fact untimely.

23

QUESTION:

But

Do you think Congress really anticipated

24

that the state agency could, just in any case that was referred

25

to it or filed with it, say,

Heritage

"Sorry, we just don't want to do

this.

what states decided to do.

QUESTION:

5
6

What is being done here is not at

I thought that Congress really wanted to

really refer the states to process these cases first.
MR. LAZARUS:

7

They wanted two things.

They wanted to

8

encourage the states to do so, not to require the states to do

9

so.

10
11

well.

And in fact, the relationship we have here works quite
The state handle a lot of the charges first.
There is an overabundance of charges, and the state

12

and federal agencies are trying to work hand-in-hand to deal

13

with these in an expeditious way, and not to have a

14

work-duplication agreement, but a work-sharing agreement.

15

only purpose of the state in this case, reserving its

16

jurisdiction, really, is to avoid a total abdication of

17

authority and to avoid the untenable result that would be

18

produced if after complete surrender of jurisdiction, the EEOC

19

subsequently determined that it lacked jurisdiction.

20

The

Respondents are really ignoring reality when they

21

suggest that the EEOC and the state are somehow conspiring in

22

devious ways to subject them to multiple jurisdiction and to

23

extend the limitations period.

24

come up with an efficient and expeditious way to share work.

25

The state agency in Colorado is not routinely processing the

Heritage

What they are trying to do is

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

17

1

charges after the EEOC has acted.
They are simply nominally holding their jurisdiction

2
3

afterwards in order to avoid what would be an untenable

4

position.
QUESTION:

5
6

But if that's such a rare case, why don't

they simply terminate the proceeding?
MR. LAZARUS:

7

Because they believe it is important to

8

take care of that rare case.

It's the states that insist on

9

this provision of the work-sharing agreement, which really I

10

think illustrates quite well that it's not the federal

11

government dominating the field.

12

playing a very active role in protecting their jurisdiction.

It's the states, who are

13

And it would be a little odd, in my —

by saying, "Well, you go ahead an investigate it first, and if

3

MR. LAZARUS:

That's not precisely true.

Congress

4

wrote section 706(e) a little more fine-tunely than that.

5

Congress said, "It's 300 days, or thirty days after the

6

termination of state proceedings, whichever is earlier."

7

soon as the state terminates it proceedings, the complainant

8

only has thirty days to file with the EEOC.

9

less than 300 days; that may be less than 180 days.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. LAZARUS:

So as

That might be much

But you're saying -The 300-day limitation period does not

apply in every case.

It's 300 days or thirty days after the

13

termination of state proceedings.

14

Our broad view, which we believe is consistent with

15

the purpose of the statute of the meaning of the termination,

16

would trigger much more readily, which Congress accounted for,

17

that earlier period.

18

QUESTION:

It seems to me if Congress meant what you

19

say it meant, it would have said that the state agency

20

relinquishes jurisdiction over the proceedings.

21

meant was, "The state got a first crack, and if they didn't

22

want it —" but instead, they used the word "terminate."

23

don't think you adequately explained the use of that word.

24
25

MR. LAZARUS:

If all they

"terminate" means "to cease," and whether a cessation

the term -- can not be ceased more than once.

QUESTION:

And it is not necessarily --

Well, when you ordinarily think of someone

describing a law suit as having been terminated, you think it

may just have been temporarily suspended, maybe a little

11

continuance or a recess?

I certainly don't think so.
It could be that the District Court

on in the process.

MR. LAZARUS:

Contrary to Respondent's claim in the Court of

whether Congress intended to preclude them from setting up this

Under this Court's decision in Mohasco, in

"terminated," and it is our position that that word should be

10

given its plain and ordinary meaning, which means "to complete,

12

When you give the word "terminated" its plain and ordinary

meaning, it is beyond question that the charge here was

14

untimely, and that the judgment of the Tenth Circuit Court of

15

16

The word "terminated" does not mean "suspend."

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD J. LAZARUS

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL

6

MR. LAZARUS:

I just have a few points on rebuttal.

7

First of all, the effect of the work-sharing

8

agreement in this case is not to lengthen the statute

9

limitations.

It is to allow the charge to be filed immediately

10

with the EEOC, and to avoid the sixty-day delay.

11

work-sharing agreement precludes the application of the

12

300-day limitations period is an issue which Respondent has not

clearly raised in this case, but is raised in another case

Heritage

They are not going

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

44
1

to act, if at all, under the work-sharing agreement, until

2

after the EEOC has acted. Indeed, under Colorado Law, under, I

3

think, Provision 24-34306-11, which is reprinted in the

4

appendix to Respondent's petition, a Colorado agency is without

5

jurisdiction to act 180 days after the charge is filed with the

6

state agency if they haven't before then noticed a hearing.

7

If the Court concludes that the states must surrender

8

their jurisdiction, but then somehow says that that doesn't

9

prevent them from reopening it later, you'll really only be

10

forcing the states to use different words.

11

what the states have done here.

12

"terminate" precludes the states from doing so.
