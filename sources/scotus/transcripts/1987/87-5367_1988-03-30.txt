ORAL ARGUMENT BY GEORGE E. BURNS, JR., ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. BURNS:

please the Court:
This case presents a rather intriguing problem of

cryptography.

The cryptogram in question is contained in the

Maryland capital sentencing proceeding used in this case.

11

It sets forth on page 14 of the Petitioner's brief,

12

and I quote,

13

each of- the following mitigating circumstances, which is marked

14

"yes," has been proven to exist by a preponderance of the

15

evidence, and each mitigating circumstance marked "no" has not

16

been proven by preponderance of the evidence."

17

'Based upon the evidence, we unanimously find that

The court of appeals determination is that a

18

reasonable juror reading that language will conclude that even

19

though there is only the possibility on the form for "yes," and

20

"no," that there are actually three possibilities; that you

21

have all agreed for yes; all agreed for no, or you have a split

22

decision.
Then this reasonable juror, without being instructed

23
24

to do so will conclude that,

circumstance, and when it comes to weighing aggravating and

2

mitigating, I as an individual juror will weigh this, even

3

though my other jurors may not."

4

instructions to do that.

None of this with

An additional problem, however, is precisely the same

5

6

language with the substitution of "beyond a reasonable doubt,"

7

for "preponderance of the evidence," is used to preface the

8

aggravating circumstance.

9

Now the court of appeals has held in Maryland that

10

the aggravating circumstances is that simply they are either

11

unanimous or it doesn't exist.

12

reasonable juror, when he comes upon this language in the

13

aggravating circumstances, he looks at this language and says,

14

'The only possibility is either we all agree or it doesn't

15

exist."

So that, once again our

16

A few moments later, encountering precisely the same

17

language, a reasonable juror who is now somewhat schizophrenic

18

concludes, "This language must mean something different now:

19

it means indeed that there is a third -possibility -- this

20

leaving it blank," I submit is the test, unless it becomes a

21

schizophrenic rather than reasonable, juror, it is difficult to

22

accept the Court of Appeal's interpretation.

23
24
25

Moreover, there are several external factors cutting
against this interpretation.
QUESTION:

First of all --

Before you go on, I guess I have two

9

The one printed in the appendix to the

There is also a third one, which is also included in

10

the appendix which is also the one propounded subsequent to

11

this case.

12

So let me go back:

there are actually three forms in

13

Maryland, the one used in this case, and the one that the

14

language I quoted comes from.

15

A second one where that language was changed

16

slightly, but as pointed out by Judge MacAuliffe in his

17

dissent, just for stylistic purposes?

Where is that?

It is somewhat confusing.

There are

apologize for that.

QUESTION:

MR. BURNS:

Yes, Justice White, and I seem to have

gotten lost in the "cryptic" avenue in this instance, but I

think that the forms are, this first form is -- and the second

14

It's just a stylistic

And the new form, as I think the Court will note, the

15

new form is, at best, a distant cousin to the first form.

16

specifically sets out the possibility you either all agree; you

17

don't agree; you're divided; and you mark three alternatives

18

for each mitigating, you mark according to these three

19

possibilities.

20

It

At the end of that form it provides each juror to

21

individually assess what he thought; she thought; the

22

mitigating factors were.

23

jurors thought there were five mitigating factors; and six

24

didn't; those six jurors would weigh those mitigating factors

25

against the aggravating.

Heritage

So if you had a situation where six

In short, I think it is very difficult to accept the

1

2

court of appeals' assurance that every juror who understood the

3

first form, when the court of appeals thought it was necessary

4

on an emergency basis to drastically change that form.
I also think it is worth pointing out, as the

5

6

dissenter did in the court of appeals, that prior to this case,

7

there is no evidence that any juror ever indicated in any way

8

that there was a divided jury on any mitigating circumstance.

9

Subsequent to this case there was an opportunity in

10

the forms and instructions to show division, two of the three

11

capital cases that were decided jurors indeed demonstrated that

12

they were split on some mitigating factors.
I think that the dissent persuasively points out that

13
14

it defies reason to suppose this is all a matter of

15

coincidence.
I also think it's important to look at the interplay

16
17

between the court of appeals' opinion and the brief of the

18

state in this Court.

19

reasonable juror is going to sit around and think of a rather

20

intricate procedure to follow, even with instructions.

The court of appeals has held that this

The state, on its part, disagrees with the court of

21

22

appeals.

Indeed, the state says the court of appeals is wrong

23

in how they interpret the statute.

24

the statute actually meant was that if you disagree, any

25

disagreement, any mitigating factor; hung jury; mistrial.

The state says that what

8

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

628-4888

The

1

court of appeals specifically rejected that interpretation in

2

its opinion.

3

The point of this, I think, on the one hand we have

4

the court of appeals offering an interpretation in which it

5

then says every reasonable juror would have understood.

6

the state, even to this day, doesn't understand that

7

interpretation.

8

9

Yet

On the other hand, the state offers us an
interpretation that the court of appeals says it's wrong and

10

didn't understand.

11

appeals can't agree, it's far too much and far to/optimistic to

12

assume somehow that this hypothetical reasoning juror would

13

have understood all this, or indeed, any of it.

14
15

QUESTION:

I submit that if the state and the court of

Would you go through it for me once more?

You know, this is kind of a hard case to follow.

16

MR. BURNS:

17

QUESTION:

I understand, Justice Stevens.
The difference between the state and the

18

court of appeals is that the court of appeals said that if

19

there was disagreement on one mitigating factor, the

20

consequence would be mistrial?

21

MR. BURNS:

No.

The court of appeals says a juror

22

would conclude that we leave this blank, and then I, but if I

23

found the mitigating factor, I'm the only juror that did -- if

24

I found that mitigating factor, when we weigh aggravating and

25

mitigating, in my mind, I would weigh them and at that point I

9

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

1

might decide that even if I found this mitigating, aggravating

2

still outweighed mitigating, you could have Death â€” or it

3

could be the other way.
QUESTION:

4
5

The state position's the other.

I thought the state court of appeals said

the form would be left blank on such a â€”
MR. BURNS:

6

That was their conclusion -- their

7

conclusion was that that particular part of the form would be

8

left blank, and that that juror would know to leave it blank

9

and

10

he would remember that he's entitled in the final analysis

to use that mitigating circumstance.
Now, the state's position is not that.

Wait, what do you mean,

"he would

How could he fail to remember when â€”

15

MR. BURNS:

16

QUESTION:

Oh, I think he would remember.
â€” well, because it walks you through it,

17

and in the determination of sentence, it says,

18

the answers in section one are marked "no," do this; if section

19

two is completed and all of the answers are marked "no," then

It doesn't take a whole lot of memory; it just
If all of them were not marked "no'"

22
23

MR. BURNS:

24

QUESTION:

25

That's true.
â€” if one of them was left blank, that

means that all of them are not marked no.

That doesn't take a

10

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

628-4888

1

whole lot of ingenuity to figure out.
MR. BURNS:

2

But it presupposes, of course, that you

3

understood in the beginning that you could leave it blank, and

4

that you were entitled on an individual basis.
QUESTION:

5
6

You mean your second point is your first

point?

7

MR. BURNS:

8

QUESTION:

They're one and the same, it seems to me.

9

MR. BURNS:

I don't think so because if you look at

They're related, Justice Scalia.

10

the new form, the court of appeals thought it was necessary to

11

add specific language at the end, saying that each individual

12

juror would do this.

13

So apparently the conrtrYjJf" appeals, notwithstanding

14

their opinion in Mills, wasn't so sure jurors would understand

15

unless they were told.

16

QUESTION:

You can always make somebody that's

17

tolerably good better.

18

this case on the basis that this form could have been improved.

19

MR. BURNS:

I don't think that we should decide

I agree with that, but I think just

20

looking at the forms, we don't really have much in terms of

21

making good better, we have here, if you weren't familiar with

22

the statute, I'd be willing to bet that I could show these two

23

to any lawyer and you would never guess that they came from the

24

same state.

25

These forms are decidedly different.

And I think it is difficult on the one hand to say

11

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1

that it's important and certainly good to explain all these

2

things, but the same thing could have presumably been

3

accomplished if we said we use this form but we give all these

4

instructions.

5

6
7

But the point is, these are decisive differences
between these two forms.
QUESTION:

I think you ought to talk about this case

8

as though there hadn't been a new form published and just you

9

are faced, then, with the court of appeals decision that the

10

form that was used in this case was perfectly adequate.

11

MR. BURNS:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. BURNS:

I said that, Justice White -Well, that's your problem.
I don't think so, because as I pointed

14

out, one of the problems that I see besides the instructions

15

not directing the jury to do any of these mental gymnastics,

16

the other problem is this language using the same language in

17

the aggravating and the mitigating, yet at the same time saying

18

the juror without being told to do so, is going to have to

19

treat it in a different way, although it's the same language in

20

the aggravating and mitigating.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Burns, I take it the defendant in this

22

case made no objection to the use of this particular form, and

23

made no objections to the instructions given at the time?

24

MR. BURNS:

25

QUESTION:

That is true, Justice O'Connor.
So for you to prevail, we would have to

12

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

find that the error amounted to plain error, if it existed at
all?
MR. BURNS:

I don't think so, Justice O'Connor,

because, of course, the court of appeals did not decide it on
this basis.

And I think what it really comes down to, if the

court of appeals is right, of course, there is no problem;
everyone understood and these were all the instructions you
were entitled o.
If we're right, what we're saying is no rational
person could have possibly understood what the court of appeals
has today in this case said, and therefore, no one would have
objected because no one would have thought this was really what
it meant.
So I think in this case, and in a normal case, that
would be true.

But I think the two problems here procedurally,

the court of appeals didn't decide it on that; and the way the
court of appeals decided it â€” and our position being that the
court of appeals obviously has the right to interpret the
statute, but they don't have the right to interpret it in a
dramatically new way, and then apply it to this petitioner.
QUESTION:

Well, at least we know that, on this --

the form that this jury returned, they at least, the jurors
indicated they unanimously agreed that none of the -- there
were no mitigating factors.
MR. BURNS:

They did, Justice O'Connor, but of

Heritage

13
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

course, there is no evidence to show, and they were certainly

2

never told, that if you look at the instructions, it was clear,

3

"unanimous -- yes or no," they weren't told anything about this

4

possibility, that perhaps if you're not unanimous, you still

5

may retain your individual judgment â€”

6

QUESTION:

Well, the fact is, though, we have a

7

situation where they've indicated unanimously that they don't

8

find any of the mitigating circumstances or any at all.

9

MR. BURNS:

Well, we have a form.

Our position is we

10

have a situation where they have indicated that it's not

11

unanimous that they find one.

12

and that, I think is the court of appeals' position is, there

13

is more than that:

14

necessarily unanimously don't find the non-existence; that is,

15

the opposite.

16

Now, the court of appeals says,

there is also a finding that they

The problem, of course, is that there is nothing, no

17

instruction, even coming close talking about that case.

18

Nothing on the form talking about that case; and so what it

19

really comes down to is a matter of fate.

20

QUESTION:

Weren't they told several times in the

21

instructions they had to be unanimous on all their findings as

22

to mitigation?

23

MR. BURNS:

They were told, but I think that that may

24

cut the other way because I think they would also be told the

25

other thing if the court of appeals' interpretation be correct,

14

you also have to be unanimous on the lack thereof.

you're told you have to be unanimous, it seems to me that jury

7

room, but I think -QUESTION:

9

no.

Because if

Eleven of us thought it

That's the problem I think in this

There is absolutely no indication to

support your hypothesis.

I mean, we have the return forms by

10

the jury and the instructions; and they tally perfectly.

Your

11

hypothesis is that some jurors might have reasoned a different

12

way.

But there is simply no indication that they did.

13

MR. BURNS:

The problem, Chief Justice Rehnquist, is

14

of course, our position is under these forms, there is no way

15

they would have any way to communicate that to anyone.

16

you set lip the form in such a way, and set up the instructions

17

in such a way that you don't offer the possibility of this

18

third possibility, then you're never going to get the third

19

possibility.

20

means that you've presented it to the court in such a way, that

21

unless you have a juror that is very, very creative, even if he

22

thinks all these things, or even if eleven of them thinks them,

23

there is simply nothing in the form that they can show that to

24

the court.

25

And if

I don't think it means it doesn't exist; it just

QUESTION:

It's just as likely that there was

Heritage

unanimity, actual unanimity.
MR. BURNS:

2
3

Well, there could have been, Justice

White --

4

QUESTION:

Well, there could have been.

5

MR. BURNS:

I think the problem is â€”

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. BURNS:

It's not unusual.
-- the court of appeals â€” well, the

8

court of appeals, to be correct, I think, has to be more than a

9

toss of the coin; there has to be some certainty; and if the

10

only certainty it seems to me that you can get is if you have

11

very specific instructions or a form that makes it clear that

12

the jury knows what it is that you are doing.

13

Indeed, I think it's interesting that even one judge

14

at the court of appeals says that he would have never have

15

imagined this system and could have never believed that anyone

16

thought of it; no one had ever talked about it in the past; and

17

yet, we're asking this court to believe that jurors on their

18

own were fully aware of all these subtleties, that I think are

19

fairly difficult at this point to understand.

20
21

22

As to the victim-impact issue, I would only comment
on the harmless error argument.
QUESTION:

I just want to ask you one question before

23

you get to that:

24

with no form, would your argument be the same?

25

if the jury had simply been instructed orally

MR. BURNS:

I think depending on the instructions --

Heritage

16
Reporting

Corporation

628-4888

QUESTION:
MR. BURNS:

The instructions would be the same.
Then I think it would be the same.

Because I think these instructions fairly cover this form, so I
think either way you have the instructions and the form, I
agree, are absolutely consistent in this case, so I think that
may be the problem.

And the reason I asked that, Justice

Kennedy, because you might have a case where by instructions,
obviously, you could give all these alternatives, and then with
the forms that we would say is inadequate, it might be okay.
But in this case you had instructions obviously, the
judge thought the form worked that way.

Not unreasonably.

As to the harmless error â€”
QUESTION:

Before you get to the other question, too,

in your brief, you list seven potentially mitigating
circumstances on page 4.

And I gather the defense lawyer did

argue those to the jury?
MR. BURNS:

He did, and there is one other one we

also pointed out in our footnote 4, they didn't argue, he
argued them, yes.

There was evidence presented for these but

they could have found didn't.
QUESTION:

Do you interpret the jury's finding that

there were no mitigating circumstances to mean that they didn't
think that these were factually correct, or that if indeed the
man had a low I.Q., we don't consider that mitigating?
MR. BURNS:

An interesting question, Justice Stevens.

Heritage

17

(202) 628-4888

I'm not sure because, again, we have no way of knowing what a
juror thought about this; it seems to me -QUESTION:
MR. BURNS:

Did the judge give them any help?
The judge gave the generally set-out

routine instructions; he did not specifically say that; he
really put it to the jury and said that you consider it, and
they do consider it.
Now, I think it's possible, obviously, a juror could,
I suppose, in a case, consider them factually, but most of
these things, some of them are argumentative.

QUESTION:

Some of them are

Wasn't there evidence in the record that

he terminated his education at the sixth grade?
MR. BURNS:
QUESTION:
MR. BURNS:

Yes, Justice Stevens, evidence like that.
Was that a disputed fact?
Most of the factual things were not.

They were not disputed.

So it would seem that if the jury all

concluded that it was not, it would seem that their finding is
not mitigating.
QUESTION:

So what they're saying in effect is, these

facts are not sufficiently sufficient even to be justified as
to be called mitigating, so we don't have to even weigh them,
which is quite different, per se.
MR. BURNS:

I think so, Justice Stevens.

I think

that's a fair interpretation, at least of the historical fact.

MR. BURNS:

I think so, Justice Stevens.

it's a fair interpretation of the ones that at least present

14

perhaps they could have but they didn't â€” to say that there

15

was any procedural bar to the consideration.

16

I think there are two points:

one is the procedural

But the second point, perhaps more Importantly, is if

17

the court of appeals is correct, and this is all clear to

QUESTION:

You are going to leave to your briefs

3

whatever questions there may be as to whether the introduction

of this evidence was a violation of the Eighth Amendment?
MR. BURNS:

5

Yes, of course, Chief Justice.

If you

have any questions, I would be happy to answer them.

But our

7

position has been set out in the briefs.

8

obviously we're relyinq on booth, and our point was, I think,

9

too,

But of course,

(1) that the court of appeals simply ignored one prong of

10

the Booth test; and the state's response is in part that it's

I do have one further question.

You also

without arguing that, if the form did require â€” if it was

10

misleading, and if the jury indeed didn't realize that they had

11

to be unanimous as to no mitigating circumstance, then it would

12

be unconstitutional?

13

MR. BURNS:

Yes, Justice Scalia.

The reason I

14

haven't argued it is of course the court of appeals did not

15

decide that it was unconstitutional; but decided that clearly

16

that wasn't going to be the law in Maryland.

17

I think, as we pointed out in our brief, you would

18

have a very serious constitutional problem, because what it

19

would amount to, if it were interpreted as we originally

20

thought it was to be interpreted, you could have in essence one

21

juror deciding you were going to get capital punishment, even

22

though eleven disagree.

23

QUESTION:

It would still allow all mitigating

24

circumstances to be taken into account; it would be a state

MR. BURNS:

It doesn't narrow the

It may be -- I'm not so sure about that,

Justice Scalia, because it may be you could draft the statute,

10

getting around the problem of unanimity, but I think here you'd

11

have a fully open statute, and what I mean by that is, you'd

12

have a situation literally where one juror says, I think this

13

person deserves death; I don't think there are any mitigating

14

factors.

15

Eleven jurors think there are 13 mitigating factors,

16

and it's simply overwhelming.

the one juror rule, if you're unlucky to get one juror who

thinks you should get Death; then you're going to get Death.

can be arbitrary, because what you're doing in that case is

MR. BURNS:

I think in the context of the jury

system, that we 're looking for a jury of 12 people to decide
this to say in effect we'll tolerate one saying it is
capricious, because if we looked at the jury, and even if we
had the seven-five, we're giving some play to the notion that
it's the group, it's the jury, deciding it.
If we're looking at one, it's â€” I don't want to use
the term,

"anti-democratic," but it is an odd notion in a more

or less democratic society, of this extreme decision being made
on the basis of one as opposed to eleven.

Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Burns.

Mr. Monk, we'll hear from you now.
ORAL ARGUMENT BY CHARLES J. MONK, II, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. MONK:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
The last instruction -- the very last instruction,
the jury in this case heard before it retired to deliberate â€”â€¢
and this is on page 95 of the joint appendix, is as follows:
The court said as it passed out the forms to the jury,

"Let me

remind you that, as you consider each of the circumstances, you
must indicate yes or no, however your unanimous decision falls.

Heritage

25
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

You must indicate yes or no as to each of those circumstances."
It seems to me that that instruction, together with
the form that was used in this case, plus the instructions that
where the court before the closing arguments of counsel, went
through the form, and six or seven times reminded the jury that
their determination on each question must be unanimous.
QUESTION:

Where is that in the materials here?

I'd

like to look at what he told them just before they went -MR. MONK:

At page 95, Justice Scalia.

QUESTION:

Page 95 of what?

MR. MONK:

Of the joint appendix.

The closing arguments are concluded; the court has
already reviewed with the jury before closing arguments the
form itself, which is discussed in our brief, and now he is
sending the jury out to deliberate and he says,

"Let me remind

you as you consider each of the circumstances, you must
indicate yes or no however your unanimous decision falls. "
QUESTION:

What point are you making?

MR. MONK:

The point, Justice White, is that these

instructions read by a reasonable juror would have led them to
conclude that they must unanimously decide yes or no on each
one of the mitigating circumstances, and if that is so, then we
don't have a Lockett - Eddinqs problem in this case.

In other

words, the jury deliberated, considered the evidence considered
in mitigation, and rejected it.

As I read your brief, and as I seem to

have the same notion now, you don't think you need to go

through the routine that the court of appeals did to sustain

this?

5

MR. MONK:

I don't think that, with all due respect

6

to Mr. Burns, that his interpretation of what the court of

7

appeals said is correct.

8

precisely that point.

9

unanimity as to yes or no with respect to the mitigating

I think the court of appeals reached

Their view was that the statute requires

circumstances, that they consider that the jury in this case

11

consider the evidence â€”

12

QUESTION:

And if eleven jurors thought there was a

13

mitigating circumstance and one thought not, they had to â€” the

14

jury had to proceed on the basis that there were no mitigating

15

circumstances?

16

MR. MONK:

That's not correct.

If eleven jurors

17

thought there were mitigating circumstances and one thought

18

there was not, the jury would have to continue to deliberate

19
20

until they reached a conclusion.
â– itÂ»*'
And if they could reach a conclusion, then there

would be a hung jury.

22

the court of appeals opinion is at 126 - 127, the court of

appeals makes that exact argument.

24
25

QUESTION:

If you look at the joint appendix where

3

4

imprisonment would have been tendered.

5
6

7

QUESTION:

And the tender would have been another

proceeding?
MR. MONK:

No.

Under the Maryland statute, life

8

imprisonment would have imposed.

The instructions in this

9

case, and I think this is a jury instruction case under

10

California v. Brown, one is obligated to look at all the

11

instructions including the language of the form and the

12

instructions that the court gave as it explained the form in

13

its final instructions, as I pointed out, and determined what a

14

reasonable juror under the circumstance would have -- how he or

15

she would have viewed this instruction.

16

And I think it's very clear that they would have

17

concluded that there was a requirement of unanimity and that

18

they had to make an ultimate determination.

19
20

QUESTION:

Under the Maryland rules there would have

been a hung jury?

21

MR. MONK:

Right.

22

QUESTION:

And life imprisonment?

23

MR. MONK:

And life imprisonment.

24

QUESTION:

What do you do with the Petitioner's

25

argument when he points out that the form had been used 25 or

Heritage

28
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

*

1

30 times and the "no's" were filled out in every case all the

2

same, and then when they changed the form, blanks began to

3

occur?
MR. MONK:

4

Justice Kennedy, the instructions of this

5

court were "answer every question."

So I would expect in every

6

form in the other cases when this was used, that they would

7

have answered every question.

8

the new form came into place, and the jury was given the

9

opportunity to say,

When they changed the form, when

"Well, we've taken an initial straw vote

10

and some of us think there's mitigation evidence here, but we

11

all can't agree," they didn't have to force themselves to

12

deliberate and debate the issue further; they were just given

13

the opportunity on the new form to indicate that and go on to

14

weighing.

15
16

And so I don't think they were compelled as a jury
through the deliberative process to reach a conclusion.

17

QUESTION:

If somebody felt like leaving something

18

blank under the old form there would just have been a hung

19

jury?

20

MR. MONK:

Well, they could not reach a conclusion,

21

and therefore decided to leave it blank on the old form, they

22

would have had a hung jury.

23

QUESTION:

And it would have been life imprisonment.

24

MR. MONK:

That is correct, and indeed there is at

25

least one case --

Heritage

29
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

QUESTION:

So that the new form would make it more

likely that Death would be imposed?
MR. MONK:

That's exactly the problem that the court

of appeals thinks that they were addressing when they set forth
in their opinion explaining why the new form came into being.
They posit what they describe as the "anomalous circumstance"
where the jury might hang on mitigating circumstances; but if
they had gotten to weighing, would have concluded that the
Death penalty should be imposed.
QUESTION:

Anyway.

MR. MONK:

Anyway.

So under the Maryland scheme,

life imprisonment would have been imposed.

And in order to

avoid that circumstance, they announced therefor the new form
which allows the jury to say "we can't all agree on mitigating
circumstances, bit we'll go to weighing anyhow, and reach an
ultimate conclusion."
QUESTION:

May I ask you just to be sure -- it's kind

of hard to keep this complicated case in mind; did Maryland law
at the time of this trial require that any finding of a
mitigated circumstance be unanimous?
MR. MONK:

The Maryland Court of Appeals so-stated.

QUESTION:

In this opinion.

MR. MONK:

for a no answer on the form.

QUESTION:

So there was no statutory requirement that

a finding of no mitigating circumstances be unanimous?

18

MR. MONK:

But Maryland law was by virtue of the rule

19

adopted by the court of appeals, which is a part of Maryland

20

law, that unanimity was required.

21

QUESTION:

You mean the rule adopted in this case?

22

MR. MONK:

No, a rule that was pre-existing this

case, because the form itself was adopted by rule in Maryland,

So to the extent the form was ambiguous,

or at least as the dissenting justice in the court of appeals
thought, that ambiguity would also have existed in the rule?

don't we, that nobody at these two tables here, nobody here -two people, agree what those forms mean, yet 12 jury men can
easily understand it.
MR. MONK:

Well, Justice Marshall, I can't agree with

you. I think that if you read the instructions in this case as
I think you are compelled to do in their totality, under

MR. MONK:

Well, I don't believe so, Justice

I think that those instructions fairly and

another portion of the form?

9

It's on 16A and 17A.

I believe it is.

I still hope I'm using the right
Now we're past section II, where we

10

have to mark "yes, or no" and we have established that they

11

only mark "no" if they unanimously find no mitigating

circumstance, right?

13

MR. MONK:. That is correct.

14

QUESTION:

15
16

And they leave it blank.

If only eleven

of them find a mitigating circumstance, right?
Then they move on to section III of the form which

begins at the bottom of 16A and goes over to the top of 17A --

18

"We unanimously find that it has been proven by a preponderance

19

of the evidence that the mitigating circumstances marked "yes"

20

outweigh the aggravating circumstances marked "yes."

Right?

21

MR. MONK:

That's so.

22

QUESTION:

So, if they've left some of those forms

The jury reached

And there's no objective evidence here

that would suggest that there was any disagreement.

Chief

Justice Rehnquist asked the question of Mr. Burns, you know, is
there anything to suggest that this is anything more than a
hypothetical?

The answer is clearly no.

QUESTION:

It was Mr. Burns' response that the form

didn't give them any opportunity to express, yet if there were,
but if there were none, non-unanimity?
MR. MONK:

Well, Justice Rehnquist, it seems to me

that they would have -- the two possibilities -- if they could
not agree, they would have come back to the court and said they
can't agree, we know at least in one circumstance, that one of
the lodgings that was submitted to the Court by the Petitioner,
that a jury in fact did hang, and it appears that they hung up
on mitigating circumstances, and if they deliberated for 12
hours and a life imprisonment was imposed.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Monk, does any jury form in an

ordinary case, let's talk about a capital case for a minute.
You are deciding, you are asking the jury to decide whether the
defendant is guilty or not guilty.

Now does the verdict form

in your state ever have another blank for them to indicate if
they're hung, or are they just given "guilty" or "not guilty"
and you must be unanimous?
MR. MONK:

They are not instructed in Maryland that

That he didn't have â€”
MR. MONK:

Under number 8, the jury makes a two-part

determination, it seems to me.

One part is, do we find

credible evidence that this fact exists or not?
The second part is, does that fact mitigate?
QUESTION:

Correct.

MR. MONK:

Because one through seven are defined to

be mitigating.

Number 8 is a two-part question.

QUESTION:

And so what they're really -- because what

the facts were essentially undisputed, they are really saying
none of us think that a low I.Q. or a sixth grade education has
any mitigating value at all?
MR. MONK:

That's correct.

That, I believe is the

That is probably what they concluded.

Rather than that they were not convinced unanimously that those
factors should be considered mitigating.

Which is what the

dissenting judge apparently found?

It's hard to believe that in a matter of this

importance, those instructions could be drafted in that way.

leap out and mean that to me.
MR. MONK:

Well, if you look at all of the

Heritage

41
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

instructions together, I believe that under California v.
Brown, a reasonable juror would have understood the
instructions to be read as the court of appeals interpreted
them in this case.
But there is a couple of other things that I would
point to that would lead you to that same conclusion.
QUESTION:

I shouldn't be interrupting you so much.

But may I ask you a historical question that there was
reference that Justice Kennedy made:

has there ever been a

case in Maryland in which a jury filled out everything in the
form except one mitigating circumstance, including a
recommendation of Death, and then the judge said,

"they

obviously were hung on the mitigating circumstance, so it must
be a life sentence?"
MR. MONK:

No.

There has been a circumstance where

the jury answered the aggravating questions; found an
aggravating circumstance; got to the mitigating circumstance;
answered one of those yes; didn't fill out anything else; and
was hung; deliberated for 12 hours and couldn't reach a
verdict.
QUESTION:

But the jury was hung on the ultimate

determination, too?
MR. MONK:

Well, I submit we don't know.

The form

has some marks next to the mitigating -QUESTION:

The thing that's unlikely, it seems to me,

Heritage

42
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

in the way that things happen in real life, is that they would
come to the unanimous conclusion that there should be a Death
sentence, but that they should be hung on an intermediate -- a
mitigating circumstance, and they leave that blank.

And I

gather that has never happened.
Whereas, if it did happen, you are telling me the
judge would look at the form and impose a life sentence?
MR. MONK:

Well, if the jury was unable to reach a

determination on each of the questions, then they would be hung
and a life sentence under the form -QUESTION:

Even though they filled out the rest of

the form, they said â€” they said that even one mitigating
blank, filled everything else out that would qualify for a
capital â€” for the Death sentence, the judge would then under
Maryland law have a duty to impose the life sentence, just
because of that one blank in the form?
MR. MONK:

That is the anomalous circumstance that

the court of appeals was concerned about and therefore
announced a new form to be used in future cases.
QUESTION:

Counsel, at page 141 of the joint

appendix, the majority opinion discusses in the first full
paragraph the jury's duty, and as I understand it, if the jury
is hung on mitigating, they go ahead on aggravating anyway?
MR. MONK:

Well, the aggravating comes first in the

form, Justice Kennedy.

Heritage

43

(202) 628-4888

QUESTION:

1

But it says, if they're hung as to

2

mitigating, they go on in any event to determine the

3

aggravating circumstance?
MR. MONK:

4

I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy, that passage

5

that you are referring to in 141 is referring to the new

6

procedure, not the form that was in place at the time that this

7

case was decided.
Remember that when the court of appeals announced

8

9

that they didn't want the form to be limited as it was in this

10

case, which would create the circumstance if the jury couldn't

11

reach a determination on mitigating, but had gone on to weigh,

12

and had reached the Death penalty, under those circumstances

they would have been a hung jury, life imprisonment would have

47
Reporting Corporation

to be so excluded that it would simply give the victim a
number?

"This is number 28, and we never have to know anything

about the victim."

So that when a jury is making that ultimate

determination, that moral judgment, what was the loss of
society from this victim?

They'll never know who he was or

what his contribution to society was -- I think that really
goes too far, and I think there is a principled reason that the
Court could say Booth was right because it was outrageous, goes
way beyond what we can tolerate, but that some evidence about
the victim alone tempered by the trial judge's admonition to
avoid undue prejudice, could be appropriate.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY GEORGE E. BURNS, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER â€” REBUTTAL
MR. BURNS:

Initially, I think the crucial problem

with the state's position as I now understand it to be, is the
court's opinion set forth in the joint appendix at 136 - 141,
curiously there is not one word about a new law announcing new
forms; what the court says is Petitioner has got it all wrong;
this is what it's always meant.
The crucial point for the state to be right is just
the opposite.

It's just that the court is changing the law.

But the court specifically rejects that.

And when the court

does that, the instruction on 95, of course, cuts against the
