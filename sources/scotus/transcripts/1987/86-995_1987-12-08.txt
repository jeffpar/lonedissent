ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. RAYMOND RANDOLPH, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. RANDOLPH:

10
11

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This case is here on certiorari to the United States

12

13

Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit. The Court granted

14

certiorari to consider a question whether evidence uncovered

15

during a warrantless search in violation of the Fourth

16

Amendment may nevertheless be admitted to evidence on the basis

17

of the inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule.

The following pattern of events gives rise to this

question.

The facts

11

By noon on April 6th, the Wednesday, as I said, in

12

983, a joint FBI/DEA investigation was on-going involving a

3

total of about fifteen agents.

Before

p.m. that day, the

4

agents began keeping a warehouse in South Boston under

5

surveillance.

earlier, that it contained marijuana.

They had concluded by that time, and even

The building was located on the corner of First and D

8

Streets. It had two garage doors facing First Street and a

9

black steel door facing D Street, the only entrances to the

20

2

warehouse.
About

:45, agents saw a white truck and a green

22

camper pull up, go into the warehouse.

A few minutes later,

23

the vehicles left, they were followed by some of the agents on

24

the scene, and later stopped; one on the Massachusetts

25

Turnpike, another in Dorchester, both of the vehicles contained

In the mean time, many of the agents, at least seven,

electrician from New Hampshire. They looked through the vehicle

and there was no marijuana.

Petitioners then drove into the parking lot in

13

another vehicle, a blue van, with ladders on top. They, too,

14

were arrested.

no marijuana.

16

The agents looked through their vehicle. Again,

Several minutes later, most of the agents, except the

17

two agents in charge, Keaney and Cleary, left the parking lot.

18

They headed for the warehouse and converged there, met there

19

with several other agents, three at least, who were already

20

there, as I said, keeping the warehouse under surveillance.

21

After walking around the warehouse and announcing,

22

according to Agent Kennedy, "DEA/FBI, Open Up", one of the

23

agents took a tire iron from his car, broke open the side steel

24

door and entered.

But our proposition is there was a search here, and

1
2

that that search violated the warrant clause because they broke

3

the door down, and once they got in there, then our position is

4

that the evidence that they find has to be suppressed for three

5

reasons, which I'll get into.

6

Number 1.

If it's not, then all the incentive is

7

there to conduct a warrantless search before you get a warrant.

They had nothing to lose.

And I use the Government's argument and

this Court's in Segura, when the Government Attorney was asked

15

what is there, what incentive do agents have when they go on

premises to leave, and the Government said the incentive is to

suppress what they find when they're inside, and if they stay

18

longer, they probably will find something more.

QUESTION:

So, that gets

The Court didn't addressed the problem we

21

have here, did it, as to whether the stuff that was seen prior

22

to the securing of the premises should be suppressed?

23

MR. RANDOLPH:

The Court said in the opinion that is

24

not before it, I want to be precise about this, "however,

25

because the Court of Appeals suppressed that evidence and the

1

Government did not cross petition, however, Chief Justice

2

Burger and Justice O'Connor in a separate portion of the

3

opinion relied upon the suppression of the evidence found

4

during the warrantless entry as the reason why the decision in

5

that case would not undermine the exclusionary rule."

6

As I said, that was only one part of the opinion.

7

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Randolph, the Courts below

8

didn't really address the question of whether the -- what the

9

officers saw after their illegal entry, influenced the decision

10

to get the warrant, did th^y?
MR. RANDOLPH:

11
12

^

QUESTION:

That's correct-. They did not.

And, so, really, the question we have to

13

decide is if, in fact, what the officers saw on their illegal

14

entry did not influence, if it did not influence their

15

subsequent decision to get the warrant, must the evidence be

16

excluded.

17
18
19

MR. RANDOLPH:

Well, we are getting into the realm of

intent, and I would like to address the question this way:
The Government has made the argument in this Court

.2 0

that the officers were contemplating.

What they were

21

contemplating before they broke the door down was getting a

22

search warrant, and that's a new fact, I think, in this case.

23

It was never proposed as a finding by the Government and there

24

is testimony which we quoted in the reply brief that the agents

25

that were in charge of this investigation —
10

Heritage Reporting

F.0j0!_>.|0|!0!!0!

QUESTION:

1

Well, that wasn't addressed below, and I

2

think we need to deal with it first in the abstract. If the

3

proof is there and the trial court finds.

4

MR. RANDOLPH:

Right.

That's what I'm getting to.

5

Now, the question is what rule of law does that

6

embody.

That means if the agents had decided to get a warrant

7

before they went in and violated it under the Government's

8

theory, then all the evidence comes in.
I think that kind of a law, kind of a rule, under the

9
10

Fourth Amendment, completely destroys the warrant clause, and

11

here's why.

12

First of all, any knowledgeable officer, if the Court

13

so holds, as he's breaking into premises, will suddenly have an

14

on-rush of contemplation, a desire to get a warrant, as he's

15

walking in without one.

16

The purpose of the warrant clause is when officers

17

have a desire to search and it was inevitable this warehouse

18

was going to be searched.

19

searched legally or was it going to be searched illegally.

20

the purpose of the warrant clause is to make sure, and the

21

purpose of the exclusionary rule is to make sure, that there's

22

compliance with the Fourth Amendment.

The question was, was it going to be
And

So, if you have a rule, number one, that says

23
24

whenever you're contemplating and you've already decided to get

25

a warrant, then if you go in without one and violate the Fourth

Amendment, there's no consequence, then that seems to me to be

2

completely contrary to the Fourth Amendment.

QUESTION:

I don't think that’s the extent of the

4

rule that is suggested.

5

fact, had probable cause to get a warrant, and if what they see

6

after the illegal entry does not affect their decision to seek

7

a warrant, then must the evidence be excluded.

8

10

11

MR. RANDOLPH:

It's a question of if the officers, in

But, then, we're getting into, I

think, Justice O'Connor, a land of make-believe.

Let me

explain why.
One would have to suppose that an agent, as the agent

12

is going into the premises, not knowing for sure what's in

13

there, has the following thoughts going through their mind.

14

am going to get a warrant and I'm going to carry out that

15

decision no matter what I find in that building, and if I go

16

inside that building and I find nothing, it's completely empty,

17

nevertheless I'm carrying out that decision.

18

to a magistrate, I'm going to swear I have probable cause to

19

believe that whatever I was looking for is there, and I'm going

20

to go back and search it, even though I'm not going to find it.

21

It has to influence.

22

QUESTION:

I

I'm going to get

Well, I don't follow that scenario at all.

23

The question only arises if, in fact, they get a warrant and go

24

back and try to seize evidence that's offered at trial.

25

MR. RANDOLPH:

And the consequence of that, of
12

Heritage Reporting Corporation

allowing that evidence in is that there's no deterrent anymore

because what incentive is there for an officer who knows that

More than that, if it's the intent to get a warrant

MR. RANDOLPH:

I've gotten ahead of myself. The

decide — the conference is to go to get a warrant at the

courthouse which is a short distance away, and two of them

6

depart and eight hours later, about 10:40 in the evening, a

7

magistrate signs the warrant.

8

9

The agents then, who were still at the warehouse
guarding it, immediately go back in. They don't even know what

10

the terms of the warrant are.

The Government in this case, in addition to the

15

notion of inevitable discovery, is now saying that there is no

18

be introduced at trial and was, in fact, introduced.

There's no connection

I've already addressed one of their arguments, one of

20

the reasons is well, it really wasn't seized until the warrant

21

arrived, and I think there's nothing to that.

So, the first question I'd like to address is whether

4
5

they are right.

The Government's position, as I stated it a

6

moment ago, is with one qualification exactly what this Court

7

held three years ago in Segura v. United States.

8

necessary qualification, which has already received some

9

discussion this morning, is that the Court was addressing only

The one

part of the evidence seized pursuant to the warrant in Segura.

11

Only the evidence that had been present but not seen during the

12

unlawful entry was at issue"in Segura.

13

The 2nd Circuit had suppressed all of the evidence

14

that was seen during the unlawful entry.

15

not cross petitioned on that issue.

16

record, however, that we were very careful in our brief in

17

Segura in Footnote 21 to state that our position was that that

18

evidence should not have been suppressed either, even though we

19

did not cross petition on it.

The Government had

Footnote 21 of our brief stated that the independent

source and the inevitable discovery documents should apply to

22

the previously-seen evidence just as to the previously-unseen

evidence.

24

discussed the distinction between seen and unseen evidence, he

25

was quite careful to say that that was a distinction the Court

QUESTION:

sentence very similar to the sentence you can find in the text

of our brief in Segura, a sentence off of which Footnote 21

21

hangs, saying that we were not endorsing that view.

22

QUESTION:

What is the deterrent then if it won't be

23

suppressed?

If you say it may. Of course, anything might be

MR. ENGLERT:

No sanction whatsoever, Your Honor,

magistrate makes, which is whether probable cause exists.

think that that is commendable police practice,

MR. ENGLERT:

the burden of proof, but you don't have the burden of going

9

MR. ENGLERT:

7

Is that your thought?
We certainly have the burden of showing

a lack of causal relation.

8

QUESTION:

And there's no such finding —

9

MR. ENGLERT:

Lack of causal relation was at issue in

10

the lower courts, but the only contested aspect of that issue

11

in the lower courts was whether the acquisition of the warrant

12

— well, in fact, I'm not sure there was any contested aspect

13

of that in the lower courts.
The argument that was made in the lower courts, which

is repeated here today, is that it doesn't matter if there's a

16

causal relationship. Everything that's seen has to be

According to Petitioners,

that makes all the difference in the world.

3

They say that

That argument has been presented to five Federal

4

Courts of Appeals in the three years since Segura was decided.

All five have rejected that argument and have admitted

relationship.

9

The 1st, 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th Circuits.

The 2nd Circuit, in reaching that conclusion,
overruled its own prior Segura decision to the extent that it

10

requires suppression of previously-seen evidence in the absence

11

of a causal relationship.

12

There are, of course, courts that have ruled against

13

the Government in cases that have some similarity to this.

14

particular, in cases in which the evidence was physically

15

seized during the entry and the argument was only, well, we

would have gotten a warrant if we hadn't done that.

previously-unseen evidence in the way that Petitioners would

draw it and said there is no need for a causal relationship in

the case of previously-seen evidence.

21

But no

That is why the Chief Justice said in Nix v. Williams, the

not to put the Government in a worst position than if no

QUESTION:

That's the lesson of Wong Sun and Segura

And you say we don't have findings by

speak, and the things that were unseen?

Page 42A in the middle of Paragraph U,

20

the Court finds that "in an effort to apprehend any

21

participants who might have remained inside and to guard

22

against the destruction of possibly-critical evidence, the

23

agents made a forced entry of the building".

24
25

That is a finding directly contrary to Petitioner's
suggestion that the reason they entered was to search for
26

Heritage Reporting Corporation
Ir9n9l

1

marijuana.

That point was argued in the District Court, that

2

they were looking for marijuana when they went inside. The

3

District Court found otherwise.

4

The District Court went on to find that the warrant

5

was not vissiated by the prior illegal search which is also a

6

finding on the absence of causal relation.

7

This is a warehouse that had been under surveillance

8

for about an hour and a half before the warrantless entry

9

occurred.

At the time the warrantless entry occurred, two

10

vehicles that had been seen coming out of the warehouse at 2:05

11

p.m. had been stopped and found to be full of marijuana.

12

As Mr. Randolph said in his argument, there was

13

already a suspicion even before the stopping of those vehicles

14

that this warehouse was a distribution point for large

15

quantities of marijuana.

16

What Petitioners are suggesting, even though they

17

didn't suggest it in the lower courts, is that this Coiirt must

assume that that warehouse would have been left alone if no

There's another scenario that might make the

4

had used that opportunity to physically seize the evidence in

5

the warehouse, then, of course, it would be plausible that they

6

didn't at that time have an intent to come back.

7

If, when they went in, they

For example, in Footnote 12 of their reply brief, the

8

Petitioners cite some cases in which agents made exigent

9

circumstance entries on the premise, seized evidence, and

10
11

didn't come back later with a warrant to get it again.
Well, of course, if the evidence has already been

12

seized, that negates any inference that there was already an

13

intent to go get a warrant.

a case in which no physical seizure of the evidence took place

while the agents were in the warehouse.

something and when you make the search, you don't actually find

taken place if they went into a place like this and found --

kinds of searches that may happen to confirm what is found

You are right that it doesn't bear on the

fashion?

13

MR. ENGLERT:

The answer is no, Your Honor.

It is

14

not eliminating all the deterrent effect because it remains the

15

Government's burden of proof to show a lack of causal

16

connection once the illegal entry is established or is assumed.

17

The Government bears the litigation risk that it will

fail in that burden of proof, and that is one of the risks

MR. ENGLERT:

But such factors as to whether they

you can make them even more clear, you had an Assistant U.S.

MR. ENGLERT:

1

In the precise circumstances you pose,

2

that's correct, but there's nothing novel about the proposition

3

that there may be situations in which the exclusionary rule has

no deterrent effect.
QUESTION:

Let me ask you another question. You say

you also might run a risk if the officers would seize the

logically should you not make the inevitable seizure argument?

It depends

So, then, that additional sanction you

mentioned, you really are not maintaining.

MR. ENGLERT:

will be harder for the Government to carry its burden of proof

on this factual question in those circumstances.

10

QUESTION:

Why?

11

MR. ENGLERT:

Because, in a case like this, in which

a brief tour was made and nothing was seized, that tends to

13

confirm the Government's assertion that the plan from the start

14

was to go get a warrant.

start seizing things, that tends to suggest that they're

grabbing what they can while they may and they haven't thought

QUESTION:

Yes, I understand it, but basically what

you're saying is we should not rely on the exclusionary rule

for the deterrent for warrantless entries when there's (a)

convenient to do so.

7

The exclusionary rule will no longer have

MR. ENGLERT:

In cases in which the Government makes

8

a sufficient showing, that's right, because the purpose of the

9

exclusionary rule is to exclude evidence come about by

10

illegality.

It's not to compensate for invasion of privacy.

11

That's what civil remedies are for, and in cases in which there

12

is no causation, the evidence is not going to come about by

13

exploitation of an illegality.

14

but that illegality has resulted in an invasion of privacy, not

15

in the seizure of evidence, and that's why a civil remedy is

16

appropriate in that case and an exclusionary remedy is

17

appropriate only in the case in which the causation element can

18

be established.

There has been an illegality,

10

They broke through the door.

QUESTION:

I can stand outside

Mr. Randolph, I don't understand your

11

seizure argument because it seems to me that if we agree with

12

the Government in this case, that inevitably they would have

13

seized it as well as seen it, and I think they had -- it would

14

cure the illegal seizure much as it cures illegal search.

15

MR. RANDOLPH:

I fully agree, Justice Stevens.

My

16

only point is they are using this argument to show there's no

17

causal connection.

18

source, no causal connection part. They're not using the

19

argument as I understand it in their inevitable discovery.

20

two are different.

21

They're using it in their independent

The

Inevitable discovery is really a hypothetical

22

independent source whereas independent source means you've got

23

it somewhere else.

24

because the positions of the Government are inconsistent.

25

So, I find myself being inconsistent

I'd like to make two final points.

The arguments

42

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

that we've heard here today from the Government are not new.

2

Those arguments have been made before in this Court, and they

3

have been made very vigorously in situations that were far more

4

compelling, I would think, than this case.
In the National Security Wiretap case and in Katz,

5
6

the Government argued strenuously that it should be permitted

7

to get after-the-search warrants, that it should be able to

8

search first, get a warrant later, admit the evidence, and the

9

Court rejected, particularly in the U.S. District Court, in the

10

stirring opinion by Justice Powell, rejected that position flat

11

out.

12

The other point I'd like to make is there really is

13

not very much need to speculate in this case about what would

14

happen if you unleash agents, police, from the warrant

15

requirement, from the constraints of the exclusionary rule.

16

One doesn't have to speculate.

17

QUESTION:

18

The --

How is your theory consistent with Segura?

Why is Segura all right under your analysis?
MR. RANDOLPH:

19

Segura can rest on the following

20

proposition, that what was not seen was not seized within —

21

unreasonably seized within the apartment, and the following

22

example —

23
24
25

QUESTION:

So, unless we agree with you that there's

a seizure here, then Segura covers this case?
MR. RANDOLPH:

Segura does not cover this case.
43

Heritage Reporting Corporation
lr905'l

1

Segura rested on the independent source.

The warrant was an

2

independent source for finding things that remained unseen.

3

Segura did not address the next point, although Justice

4

O'Connor and Chief Justice — I'll give you an example that

5

maybe is the best I can do.
If the police had gone into Segura's apartment and

6
7

there was an individual hiding in a closet, I don't think -- a

8

secret room, I don't think one could say that individual had

9

been arrested; that is, seized from the moment they were there

10

and the nineteen hours they remained.

Therefore, because they

11

w^ra in there illegally,- there was no connection between that

12

individual and the police, but when the warrant arrives, they

13

break down the secret room and they find the individual, then I

14

think at that point there is an independent source so long as

15

the warrant itself rested on probable cause before the entry.
I think that's the best I can do, but when they find

16
17

things illegally, when they're in there, then if they're not

18

suppressed, then we're not deterring, we're giving an incentive

19

for illegal entries, we're giving an incentive for searches

20

beyond the scope, and I might add, I might add that even the

21

illegal entry part of the proposition is not necessary under

22

what I'm contending here.
The entry could be legal. For example in the Chimel

23
24

case, and then the scope of the search is wider, and the

25

Government would still come back and say inevitably we could

The last points I wanted to make, I was leading up

2
3

to, was the experiences in Colorado and California.

In the

4

majority opinion in the California Supreme Court and in the

5

concurring and dissenting opinion that we cited, this

6

situation, this factual situation came up, and both the

7

majority and the concurring opinion pointed out that they had

8

to put a stop to it because it had become standard police

9

practice to go in before the warrant arrived.

They stopped it.

California had the same experience. They had

10
11

initially in one case allowed — accepted the Government's

12

argument here, and what they found after a few years was it had

13

become standard police practice, and I'd also, and this is

14

speculation, I admit, but one has to wonder why suddenly we

15

find case after case after case with this factual situation

16

coming up.

Take a look at the cases that we've cited in our

brief. There are tons of them.

woodwork now, and there's — I would submit to the Court that

20

the reason is once you allow this to happen, once you allow

21

warrantless illegal searches to be duplicated by a search later

22

and that allows the evidence to come in, then what you will

23

find inevitably, inevitably, is that searches with warrants

will be preceded by illegal searches without warrants.
