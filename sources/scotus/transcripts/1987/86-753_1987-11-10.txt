ORAL ARGUMENT BY HARRY D. MILLER, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

MR. MILLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
The City of San Jose has enacted a unique provision

10

that it has added to an otherwise valid rent control ordinance.

11

That provision raises the question whether or not a supplier of

12

goods and services can be required to provide financial

13

assistance to a consumer solely because of the consumer's

14

ability to pay.

15

This case arises on appeal from the California

16

supreme court that reversed a decision of the trial court and a

17

decision of the district court of appeals that had held that

18

this provision violated the "just compensation" clause, the

19

"equal protection" clause, and the "due process" clause.

20

The California supreme court rejected those arguments

21

and found that the provision was valid under all three clauses.

22

The Opinion of the California supreme court found in effect

23

that, "as long as a rent control ordinance provides a fair and

24

reasonable return to the landlord, that the city has to power

25

to use the excess funds for any other public purpose."

Heritage

1

Our challenge in this case is based primarily on the

2

"just compensation" clause in reliance on the Rule announced by

3

this Court in both Aqins and in the Nollan case.

4

challenge the one aspect of the Nollan rule; we do not

5

challenge that we have been denied the economic viability of

6

the use of our land.

7

We do not

We do challenge its provision under the other part of

8

the Nollan test, and that is that this provision fails to

9

substantially advance a legitimate state interest under the

10

reasoning of the Nollan Decision, that is to say, that there is

11

no cause and effect, no nexus between any conduct by the

12

landlord and the hardship of the tenant or the necessity to

13

provide financial assistance to a tenant.

14

QUESTION:

Is there not some problem with the "just

15

compensation" clause applying at all to this case?

16

really has been no taking, certainly in any physical sense, of

17

your property.

18

MR. MILLER:

There

There had been a taking of money, Your

19

Honor.

The way the ordinance works, if a landlord wants more

20

than the rent that is otherwise provided by the mathematical

21

formulas, he then establishes in his own mind what he believes

22

is a reasonable rent, and he can then either petition the city

23

to approve that additional rent as being reasonable, or in the

24

alternative, the landlord can give a 30-day notice to the

25

tenant, establishing this higher rent, and then the tenant has

Heritage

4
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

the opportunity to file a petition with the city.
In either event, the hearing is held and the hearing

2

3

officer looks at various factors — the factors he looks at are

4

primarily the economic factors from the point of view of the

5

landlord; his rent, his expenses, et cetera — how well he is

6

maintaining the property, et cetera.

7

the hearing officer establishes what rent would be reasonable

8

under the circumstances.
Now let me use an example:

9

Based upon those factors,

assume after examining

10

all those factors, the hearing officer determines that a

11

reasonable rent for this unit would be $400 a month.

12

tenant — if the unit is not occupied by a hardship tenant,

13

then that would be the rent that the landlord could charge —

14

the $400.

15

If the

However, if this unit is occupied by a hardship

16

tenant, then he can reduce the rent to let us say, $375.

17

our position from that reduction of the rent from a reasonable

18

figure of $400 down to another figure of $375 is a taking of

19

the rent from the landlord.

20

QUESTION:

It is

But that is a very hypothetical situation.

21

You are just attacking the ordinance on its face, are you not?

22

You do not have any particular fact situation?

23

MR. MILLER:

24

QUESTION:

25

That is correct, Your Honor.
Is there any guarantee that that is how a

hearing officer would handle that sort of an inquiry?

Heritage

5
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

MR. MILLER:

1

It is our position, Your Honor, that

2

the lack of validity of this provision appears on the face of

3

the ordinance and an application would not do anything to

4

assist this Court in resolving this dispute.

5

The ordinance provides on its face expressly that the

6

hearing officer must consider the financial ability of a tenant

7

to pay.

8

unconstitutional standard, that they cannot look at the

9

tenant's ability to pay.

It is our position that that is a totally

It would be for example as if the

10

ordinance provided that the hearing officer could consider the

11

religion or political affiliation of a tenant.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. MILLER:

Who do you represent?
We represent Mr. Richard Pennell who is

14

a property owner of an apartment house and, more importantly,

15

the Tri-County Apartment Owners Association, that is an

16

unincorporated association of rental property owners.

17

QUESTION:

But surely the ordinance is not

18

unconstitutional with respect to those groups of people — or

19

let us assume that example of yours, I suppose that if the

20

landlord could collect the $400, it is not — the ordinance is

21

not unconstitutional as applied to him?

22

MR. MILLER:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

That is correct.
And it is only those landlords with

hardship tenants?
MR. MILLER:

Correct.

6

Heritage

1

QUESTION:

Well, do we have, I suppose by — saying

2

among your association members there are some landlords of

3

hardship tenants?

4

MR. MILLER:

That is correct, Your Honor.

5

we are the supplier of goods and services.

6

we supply them to everyone.

7

and non-hardship tenants.

8

9
10

QUESTION:

In fact,

We supply units and

We supply them to both hardship

But even with respect to landlords with

hardship tenants, the hearing officer is not obliged to reduce
the rent below $400?

11

MR. MILLER:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. MILLER:

That is correct, Your Honor.
So that how do we know that he ever would?
Because there is no constitutional way

14

that the hearing officer could even consider tenant hardship.

15

That is our position.

16

QUESTION:

I know that is your position. It sort of

17

has to be, I suppose.

18

MR. MILLER:

There is no way that this can be applied

19

constitutionally.

20

unconstitutional merely because it is applied.

21

It does not become more or less

QUESTION:

Well, you just answered to the contrary in

22

your example, if the landlord is allowed to collect $400, there

23

would be no problem.

24

MR. MILLER:

That is correct, Your Honor, but this

25

ordinance goes one step further.

Heritage

1

QUESTION:

But even if the landlord had a hardship

2

tenant, if the hearing officer allowed the $400, the statute

3

would not be unconstitutionally applied to him.

4

MR. MILLER:

5

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.
In fact, taking it one step further, Mr.

6

Miller, as I understand the supreme court of California's

7

Opinion, the minimum that you can get has always got to give

8

you a fair return on your investment.

9
10

MR. MILLER:
QUESTION:

That is the interpretation.
So that if they decided in your case that

11

$375 would not give you a fair return, then he would not be

12

permitted to give the $375?

13

MR. MILLER:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. MILLER:

That is correct.
Yes.
But I think that I can show the Court

16

that even though the $375 in my example is an otherwise — it

17

meets the constitutional minimum rent, I believe I can show

18

this Court that the city does not have the power or the

19

authority to take away from us that increase that otherwise be

20

determined to be reasonable.

21

QUESTION:

What if I did it in reverse and said that

22

if you had $375 as a reasonable return, that if you had tenants

23

who are multi-millionaires, you can charge them an extra $10?

24
25

MR. MILLER:

I think you would come out with the same

result, Your Honor.

Heritage

1

QUESTION:

That would be unconstitutional too?

2

MR. MILLER:

For the wrong reason:

the City of San

3

Jose could say that,

"all you could have is $375, and that is a

4

fair and reasonable, and it meets the constitutional minimum."
What they cannot do is say you can have more but then

5
6

take it away from you for the wrong reason.

7

what happened in Nollan and this Court said you could not do

8

it.
QUESTION:

9

That is exactly

What constitutional provision would my

10

hypothetical violate if they said, "the normal rent is $375 but

11

if you have a very wealthy tenant, you can charge him an extra

12

$25?"

Would that be clearly unconstitutional also?

13

MR. MILLER:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

Yes.
What portion of the Constitution would

that violate?

I believe that would violate the "just

compensation' clause under the same reasoning that we presented

lawyers to devote ten percent of their time to public service?
MR. MILLER:

Yes, Your Honor, in California we had

Heritage

10
Reporting Corporation

such an ordinance.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. MILLER:

This was unconstitutional.
This was held invalid in the Cunningham

4

case under the "equal protection" clause, that a lawyer that

5

was providing goods and services to the public cannot be

6

required to provide pro bono services in civil suits, and in

7

civil suits we have the public defender.

MR. MILLER:

Well, Your Honor, we made two arguments

18

before the California supreme court.

19

that by definition, when the hearing officer establishes a

20

reasonable rent, and then reduces it, we are being denied the

21

constitutional minimum.

22

that and we are not presenting that issue to the Court because

we know that you will accept the California court's

interpretation.

7

QUESTION:

the

MR. Miller, before you go on, just one

8

more question on the standing:

is it the case that a landlord

9

who has a hardship tenant and wants to sell

his property, the

10

purchaser from him would be subject to the same ability of the

11

California authorities to require the charging of a lower rent?

12

MR. MILLER:

13

QUESTION:

14

Yes, Your Honor.
He does not sell out from under that

provision?

15

MR. MILLER:

16

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.
So the

asserted authority by the State

17

of California does amount to in effect a sort of cloud on his

18

title to the premises?

19

MR. MILLER:

20

QUESTION:

It definitely does, Your Honor.
It is an asserted ability of California to

21

require that those premises, at least as long as this occupant

22

is in them, will bring less income?

23

MR. MILLER:

24

QUESTION:

25

That is correct, Your Honor.
And might that affect the sale price that

an individual is able to get for a unit that has a hardship

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

MR. MILLER:

It definitely will.

By reducing the

rent you reduce the value by definition.

potentially can stay there until he dies, because as long as he

5

does not default, he has a right to remain in possession.
QUESTION:

6

And that tenant

And that cloud is effective whether or not

7

you know in advance whether in fact the hearing officer will

8

reduce it?

9

10

The mere risk of his reducing it makes that unit

QUESTION:

You mean if a unit is leased for a term of

11

years that the tenant can hold over indefinitely at the lower

12

rent by virtue of this law?

MR. MILLER:

QUESTION:

15

MR. MILLER:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

Yes ma'am.
He cannot be evicted?
That is correct.

Except for default.

Notwithstanding the existence of a

leasehold period that has expired?
MR. MILLER:

That is correct, Your Honor.

There are

19

anti-eviction provisions in the ordinance which we are not

20

attacking, however I think it impacts on the effect.

21

only evict a tenant -- it is worded somewhat difficult, but

22

somewhat in effect they can only evict a tenant for a default.

25

QUESTION:

We can

Are you arguing, then, this is like a

physical taking or is it a regulatory taking?
MR. MILLER:

It has an aspect of physical, Your

Corporation

1

Honor.

2

QUESTION:

Well, which is it?

3

MR. MILLER:

How do we know?

We consider it as a hybrid, Your Honor.

4

It is not a pure regulation test as in Aqins or MacDonald.

And

5

it is not a pure, physical possession, as in Loretto.

6

it is a hybrid, as in Nollan.

7

However, because the public was given the right to pass back

8

and forth on the easement, it also has an aspect of physical

9

possession.

Rather

Nollan was a regulatory case.

And we have the same.

We admit that this is a

10

price regulation as such, but the Nollan test should apply

11

because it also has the aspect of-the physical possession.

12

tenant is given this possessory life estate and, because it

13

affects possession, it is our belief that, under the Nollan

14

standard, it is intermediate scrutiny standard, it should also

15

apply to this case because we have the similar aspect of

16

physical occupation by the tenant.

17

QUESTION:

The

The majority of the supreme court of

18

California, in answering one of your contentions, said that the

19

"City of San Jose could elect to regulate only landlords with

20

hardship tenants."

21

you disagree with that statement?

22

And thereby achieve the same results.

MR. MILLER:

Do

I agree, Your Honor, but make sure we

23

define what we are talking about.

If there is adequate

24

justification that there was a shortage of low-rent housing,

25

but there was an adequate supply of high-rent housing, I see no

15

Heritage

problem under the police power for them to rent, to regulate,

2

only low rent housing.

3

housing, the price of housing based upon the income of the

4

tenant.
QUESTION:

5
6

What they cannot do is regulate

But would that not be very much what they

were doing if they regulated only low rent housing?

7

MR. MILLER:

No, Your Honor.

Anyone can occupy low

8

rent housing, without any basis of what type of income they

9

earn, anyone — if they say "all units of $500 or less we will

10

regulate," and there was a shortage of such units, I would have

11

no problem with that.

12

regulate those units for people with certain income they are

13

now telling the landlord that "you have to subsidize this

14

tenant because of what he earns."

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

You can tell the grocer that he has to

MR. MILLER:

Yes, Your Honor.

That is the Nebbia

line of cases.
QUESTION:

If you could require him to raise it, why

can you not require him to lower it?
MR. MILLER:

The justification for Nebbia v. Bordens,

that line of cases, Your Honor, gave a justification for a

general regulation just as you have a justification for a

general rent control ordinance.

It seems to me that Appellants predicate their

opposition to the ordinance on a number of incorrect

That is not the end of the inquiry.

do the fact that we have met the first test, of the state

factors and balances them and then comes up with what is a

But that is a poverty factor.

That is a

MS. GALLO:

It is the determinant of how far we will

allow him to gouge.

of the fair return on the value of the property, we are

allowing gouging, and in some cases we are allowing more

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS — REBUTTAL

5

MR. MILLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I will

6

make it short.

I think I would like to address Justice White's

7

question on the facial challenge, as I can see his concern:

8

see no distinction on a facial challenge where the challenge is

9

under the "equal protection" or under "just compensation."

I

The

10

question is whether or not on its fact there is any possible

11

way for this standard to be applied in a.constitutional manner.

12

If we assume for a moment —

13

QUESTION:

But do we have anybody in front of us who

14

is a landlord of property with a hardship tenant who would

15

benefit from this statute?

16

MR. MILLER:

Yes, Your Honor.

We represent over half

of the residential rental units in the City of San Jose.

seen that say, "we have hardship tenants and we are affected by

21

MR. MILLER:

We allege that we have — represent

we have many hardship tenants.

MR. MILLER:

4

That is true, Your Honor, but of all the

many of them since we are the suppliers of housing in the City

7

of San Jose.

8

QUESTION:

Yes, but if even a landlord with a

10

hardship tenant, if the hearing officer in your example you

11

used before, said a reasonable rate would normally be $400, and

12

you have a hardship tenant, he could still leave it at $400.

13

MR. MILLER:

14

QUESTION:

Yes he would, Your Honor.
And that would be a constitutional

15

application, you told me before.

16

MR. MILLER:

17

QUESTION:

18

Yes, Your Honor.

incapable of constitutional application.

MR. MILLER:

It is if he is ever at any time going to

20

consider the hardship of the tenant in making his decision.

22

saying is that there is an unconstitutional law that is never
