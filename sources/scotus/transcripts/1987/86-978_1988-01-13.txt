ORAL ARGUMENT BY JOHN L. KIRWIN, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. KIRWIN:
please the Court.

This case is here on certiorari to the Eighth Circuit

10

Court of Appeals.

11

the AFDC program.

12

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

The case involves Minnesota's operation of

There are two issues raised by this case.

First,

13

does an applicant publicity regulation of the Secretary of

14

Health and Human Services require a state to single out one of

15

the myriad eligibility requirements of the AFDC program?

16

require a state to give repeated, detailed, written notice of

17

that one requirement to all applicants and recipients?

And

18

Minnesota and the Secretary argue that the

19

Secretary's regulations requires states to generally publicize

20

the AFDC program and its eligibility requirements to

21

applicants.

22

The second issue is equally significant to Minnesota

23

and to other states. Can a court apply an information

24

regulation of the Secretary in a way that effectively modifies

25

Congress' eligibility requirements?

Heritage

Reporting

Can the court require the

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

4

1

state to pay AFDC benefits to a person who is without dispute

2

ineligible to receive those benefits under Congress'

3

eligibility statute?

4

A divided panel of the Eighth Circuit required the

5

state to pay such benefits to an ineligible person.

And

6

enjoined the state from recovering over-payments made to that

7

ineligible person even though Congress had expressly required

8

states to recover all AFDC over-payments.

9

The Eighth Circuit essentially read the Secretary's

10

information regulation as modifying the statutory eligibility

11

requirement.

12

The Secretary doesn't interpret his own regulation in that way

13

and the regulation couldn't be interpreted to modify the

14

statutory requirements.

15

authority.

16

And also the statutory recoupment requirement.

That would be beyond the Secretary's

The specific eligibility requirement involved in this

17

case is the 1981 lump-sum statute.

18

from the Lukhard case, which was decided last term, the lump­

19

sum statute provides that when an AFDC family receives an

20

amount of non-recurring income greater than its monthly AFDC

21

grant, the family will be ineligible for AFDC for one or more

22

months, depending on the size of the lump-sum payment and the

23

amount of the monthly grant.

24
25

As the Court will recall

Immediately after the passage of the lump-sum
statute, which was part of the Omnibus Budge Reconciliation Act

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

5
1

of 1981, Minnesota distributed a letter to all persons who were

2

receiving AFDC in Minnesota at that time.

3

about certain of the OBRA changes. Now, there were many, many

4

OBRA changes to the AfDC program and Minnesota's letter picked

5

out 19 of the changes that Minnesota thought were the most

6

important.

The letter told them

7

One of those was the lump-sum statute.

Minnesota

8

sent that letter simply to assist its AFDC recipients and

9

Minnesota had never had the understanding under the federal

10

regulation that it was required to provide advance publicity to

11

recipients that Congress had changed eligibility requirements.

12

Apart from the 1981 letter, Minnesota's general

13

program of providing information to applicants and recipients

14

is accomplished primarily in two ways.

15

provides a pamphlet for AFDC applicants which provides general

16

information about eligibility requirements and other aspects of

17

the AFDC program.

18

First, Minnesota

The pamphlet includes descriptions of those

19

eligibility requirements which apply to every AFDC applicant

20

and recipient and which form the framework of the AFDC program.

21

The pamphlet provides specific information regarding

22

the eligibility requirements which relate to age of children,

23

statutory reason for deprivation of parental support, the two

24

different kinds of income limits, the resource limits of the

25

program, the requirements to participate in work programs and

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

6
1

in recovery of child support.
And the pamphlet tells applicants that it does not

2

3

cover all the AFDC rules, that those rules change and that

4

applicants should consult with their caseworkers concerning the

5

more specific requirements of the AFDC program.
Second, in addition to this pamphlet, Minnesota

6

7

provides a caseworker to each applicant and recipient to

8

consult with that person concerning the specifics of the AFDC

9

program.

10

Now, in addition to those information sources, every

11

applicant and recipient knows, based on their participation in

12

the program, on their completion of the application forms and

13

other periodic forms on which they have to report in minute

14

detail their income and resources and family living situations,

15

applicants and recipients know that almost any change in their

16

financial situation affects their AFDC eligibility.

17

As a general matter, the Secretary and the state have

18

determined, based on their experience in operating the AFDC

19

program, that a lengthy written explanation of eligibility

20

requirements is less helpful to applicants or recipients than

21

an individualized oral discussion at a time when the

22

eligibility requirement is meaningful to the recipient.

23

In 1984, two and a half years after the OBRA changes

24

became effective, the named Plaintiff, Kathryn Jenkins,

25

intervened in a pending Federal Court lawsuit.

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

And Jenkins

7
1

claimed that Minnesota was required to give specific, detailed,

2

periodic, written notice to every applicant and recipient

3

concerning only one requirement of the AFDC program, the lump­

4

sum statute; a statute which affects really a small percentage

5

of the recipients in the AFDC program.
The lower courts agreed with Jenkins' argument and

6

7

they ordered the state to provide that kind of notice.

And the

8

court held that Minnesota's 1981 letter which included an

9

explanation of the lump sum statute, and which Jenkins had

10

received, hadn't been specific enough in describing the lump­

11

sum statute.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. KIRWIN:

14

Who was the District Judge, MacLaughlin?
It was Judge MacLaughlin, Justice

Blackman.

15

The lower court, we believe, seriously misconstrued

16

the Secretary's regulation. What does the regulation require?

17

This is not a regulation that requires detailed

18

notice of every eligibility requirement or even of any specific

19

eligibility requirement.

20

shall be given information in writing and orally as appropriate

21

about various aspects of the program.

22

The regulation says that applicants

In addition to eligibility requirements, the state

23

has to describe program coverage, scope of the program, other

24

services available, appeal rights, and other rights and

25

responsibilities.

And the regulation requires that the state

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

8
1

provide simple pamphlets or bulletins containing information

2

about the program.

3

The state and the Secretary agree with Judge Fagg's

4

interpretation of the regulation. Judge Fagg who dissented in

5

the Court of Appeals, said that the regulations simply requires

6

the state to publicize generally in written form and orally as

7

appropriate the AFDC program and its availability.

8

9

The 8th Circuit tried to turn the regulation into
something completely different from that. The lower court held

10

that the regulation requires notice of a specific eligibility

11

requirement that the lower court felt was a particularly

12

important requirement.

13

The court held that the regulation requires that

14

information be provided to applicants despite the fact that the

15

regulation only — excuse me — to recipients despite the fact

16

that the regulation talks only of applicants and it required

17

that the notice be given periodically.

18

The Court held that the notice must include a

19

detailed description of the mechanics of an eligibility rule,

20

including examples of the rules operation.

21

None of those requirements is based on any standard

22

contained in the regulation. The Court simply constructed those

23

requirements on its own.

24
25

Under the 8th Circuit's decision, a state can never
know, until after the fact, whether it is given enough

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
628-4888

(202)

9
1

information or whether it has effectively implemented a

2

provision of the AFDC program.

3

this one eligibility requirement for this type of notice.

4

lower Court's decision can be read to require that kind of

5

notice about every eligibility requirement, although it is not

6

completely clear.

7

The 8th Circuit singled out
The

That would be virtually impossible to do and even if

8

it could be done, it would be virtually useless to applicants

9

or recipients to overwhelm them with that volume of

10
11

information.
The Plaintiffs argue that while the lower Court

12

didn't require this type of notice concerning every eligibility

13

requirement, but that the lower Court's decision is not

14

necessarily limited to the lump-sum statute either.

15

may be other eligibility requirements, as yet unidentified,

16

about which the state has to give that kind of notice.

17

That there

But when you look at what happened in this case, it

18

is easy to understand why those kinds of gray areas make the

19

situation so administratively unworkable for Minnesota and the

20

other states.

21

In 1981, there was nothing in the regulation or in

22

any interpretation of the Secretary which would have informed

23

Minnesota that it was even required by law to distribute the

24

informational letter or that it was required to single out one

25

provision of the AFDC program, the lump-sum statute, for

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

10
1
2

specialized treatment in that letter.
And in its AFDC pamphlet, Minnesota had no way of

3

knowing, based on the language of the Federal Regulation or any

4

interpretation of the Secretary, that even though not every

5

eligibility requirement had to be described, the lump-sum

6

statute did have to be described and in great detail.

7

Under the 8th Circuit's decision, a state has to

8

guess about what information is required, and about which

9

eligibility requirements have to be described.

10

And if a state predicts wrong, if a Federal Court

11

later disagrees with the state's considered judgment, based on

12

its experience, then the state's implementation of the

13

eligibility requirement is set aside for the past months, or

14

even years, as occurred in this case.

15

Even if the 8th Circuit was correct in its holding

16

that Minnesota was required to provide more information, the

17

Court's remedy here was certainly improper.

18

Jenkins had appealed the termination of her benefits, she

19

received continued benefits during that appeal process and when

20

the appeal was resolved, the county agency notified Jenkins

21

that it would recoup the overpayment that had been made to her

22

by withholding one percent of her monthly AFDC grant.

23

Because Kathryn

The 8th Circuit enjoined Minnesota from recouping the

24

overpayment made to Jenkins.

25

Minnesota had not provided enough information concerning this

Heritage

Th<=> Court said that since

(202) 628-4888

11

1

lump-sum statute, the state had not effectively implemented the

2

statute.

3

subject to the eligibility condition established by Congress.

And that Jenkins was not subject to the statute,

The lower Court ordered that Jenkins was entitled to

4
5

receive and to retain AFDC benefits, even though Congress had

6

expressly said otherwise.
In the lump-sum statute, of course, Congress had said

7
8

that when an AFDC recipient received a certain amount of

9

income, the recipient would be ineligible for a fixed period of

10

time.

And Congress did not provide that if the state did not

11

provide advance information concerning the requirement, that it

12

did not become effective and that people weren't subject to it.
And in another of the 1981 OBRA changes, Congress

13
14

said that if any recipient received more benefits than he or

15

she was entitled to receive, the state was required to recoup

16

that overpayment of benefits.

Mr. Kirwin, is the only named Plaintiff in

18

this action with standing to assert the notice issue, Kathryn

interrogatories.

QUESTION:

MR. KIRWIN:

And was that what was done here?
Interrogatories were served on the

Secretary and the Secretary's responses, we believe, were quite

confusing.

9

side the Secretary was on, on this issue.

10

In fact, the two lower Courts disagreed on which

The Secretary agrees in this case, though, that his

11

information regulation that we have been talking about doesn't

12

provide that if information isn't given, the eligibility

13

conditions won't be applied.

14

This Court has recognized in a number of cases that

15

courts can't order the benefits be paid out contrary to the

16

conditions set by Congress for the receipt of those benefits,

17

to remedy mistakes made by government agents.

18

government agents have provided mis-information, as in FCIC v.

19

Merrill or Schweiker v. Hansen, this Court nonetheless, has

20

said that Congress has established the conditions upon which

21

those monies can be paid out.

22

Even where

An administrative mistake simply doesn't create an

23

entitlement to benefits where a person doesn't meet Congress'

24

eligibility requirements.

25

That doesn't mean that a Court is without any

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

14

1

authority to remedy a state's failure to comply with an

2

information regulation if that kind of obligation exists here.

3

Certainly the Court could enjoin the state to provide the

4

required information in the future.

5

But this Court has never gone so far as to order that

6

the benefits be provided to a person who doesn't meet those

7

substantive eligibility requirements.

8
9

We believe that the lower Court both misapplied the
Secretary's information regulation and that it granted a remedy

10

which was expressly precluded by Federal Law and we ask this

11

Court to reverse the decision of the 8th Circuit.

12

And, if there are no questions, I will reserve the

13

remainder of my time for rebuttal.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, Mr. Kirwin, we

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. LARKIN, JR., ESQ.,

17

ON BEHALF OF THE UNTIED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE

18

IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONER

19
20

MR. LARKIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court?

21

Congress has not imposed any notification

22

requirements on the Secretaries or on the states, in order to

23

implement the AFDC program.

24

required to determine what types of notice the state should be

25

required to give and whether the notices should be uniform

Heritage

The Secretary has therefore been

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

15
1
2

throughout the nation.
In undertaking that responsibility, the Secretary's

3

scheme has three parts. First, applicants, that is a person

4

defined by the regulations who has submitted an application and

5

whose application has not been terminated, must be given

6

information about the basic outlines of the program.

7

Second, a recipient must be told to inform his or her

8

caseworker about changes in circumstances, so that the

9

caseworker can counsel that person about the effect, if any,

10
11

those changes in circumstances may have.
Third, applicants and recipients must be given

12

written information explaining why an application was rejected

13

or benefits have been terminated.

14

The Secretary's scheme leaves considerable discretion

15

to the states, because the circumstances under which the

16

different AFDC programs are implemented, as well as the factors

17

that are relevant to each person will vary from state-to-state

18

and from person-to-person.

19

There is no reason to believe that the situation

20

under which the AFDC program is implemented, in Minnesota is

21

the same as what it is implemented like in New York City.

22

There are a variety of different factors that can

23

vary from place-to-place or from person-to-person.

24

of income or resources that individuals may have, whether

25

individuals are receiving income or resources from some other

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

The amount

16

1

type of social service program, the number of caseworkers in a

2

community, the caseload those people may have, the ability of a

3

client to reach a caseworker's office to discuss matters with

4

him personally, and the ability of people in a particular

5

locality to understand written or spoken english.

6

Because these matters can vary greatly from state-to-

7

state, the Federal Government las left the states considerable

8

latitude in deciding how best to implement the information

9

requirements of the AFDC program.

10

The states, in turn, have to make two judgments.

11

First, advance written notice to beneficiaries, may not be the

12

most effective way of providing information about the operation

13

of the program.

14

the telephone, or other types of circumstances like that may be

15

far more appropriate.

16

And face-to-face counseling, counseling over

Some states may decide that the best way to to

17

communicate information to someone is after a person has been

18

accepted into the program, to have that person come in for

19

counseling and at that time, have that person told about a

20

variety of different general obligations and also be told that

21

they should report changes in circumstances to a caseworker.

22

In other circumstances, a state may decide that

23

written information is better.

24

as to what is reasonable. Here, for example, the affidavits

25

submitted by the caseworkers and other personnel who administer

1

the AFDC program in Minnesota, which affidavits are reprinted

2

in the Joint Appendix, indicate that the affiants believed in

3

their experience, the best way to communicate the effect of the

4

program to a person was to tell a person before or after, for

5

example, a lump-sum had been received, about how that may or

6

may not affect his circumstances.
Not every one of the different rules, including the

7
8

lump-sum rule, will affect every person who participates in the

9

program.

10

The lump-sum rule is, itself, a contingency --

certain events have to occur before it affects anyone.
In addition, there is evidence in the record,

11

12

submitted in one of the affidavits by Petitioner's state

13

officials that at least in one county, that is described as

14

being average in size, somewhere between only one and five

15

percent of the people in the program are affected by the lump­

16

sum rule.

result.

It may also be that not everyone who receives a

circumstance that medical expenses might need to be incurred.

22

The result is, that whether or not a person receives a lump

23

sum, can itself not necessarily affect the eligibility or

24

continued eligibility determination.

For example, there may be the unfortunate

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Larkin, can I backup for a second?

that you say the Secretary under its regulations must give. One

O'Connor referred to earlier, described as referring to

14

subsection I regulation that is at issue in this case.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. LARKIN:

6

No, well, the one I just read was from 90 to 91.

7

QUESTION:

8

I have in front of me the red brief at Page 18, which

9
10

This is A-89, you say?
Yes, in the Joint Appendix.

Which of those, just to help?

quotes one of these, which is 18 and 19 of the red brief. I
gather that is the one at 89, isn't it?

11

MR. LARKIN:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. LARKIN:

Yes, that is the one on the prior page.
Okay, I am sorry.
The one at 90 to 91 says, for the

14

subsection I regulation which is at issue here, does not

15

require a state to publicize the lump-sum rule or any other

16

eligibility requirements in specifically developed pamphlets or

17

bulletins.

18
19
20

The term, specifically pamphlets or bulletins, is the
term that also shows up in the regulations, subsection I.
Now, at the prior page, I think the problem that

21

resulted was that the answer attempted to answer a question by

22

referring to two regulations, at the very outset of the answer

23

at Page 89, it refers to Federal Regulations at subsection I

24

and 2, so that it is talkinq about applicants and recipients.

25

So, I think later on, when the statement says, this

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

20
1

would generally include advising applicants and recipients of

2

their obligation, if there is a drafting error it occurred

3

because the sentence was read in light of a completer question.

4

But it is not the Secretary's position that you have

5

to provide applicants with written information about the lump­

6

sum rule.

7

QUESTION:

8

And is it I that refers to applicants and II that

9

I see.

refers to recipients, is that how it works?

10

MR. LARKIN:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. LARKIN:

Yes.
I see.
Then the reasons, those I have

13

explained.

14

And what the Secretary would like is to have people given

15

information about the basic outlines of the program. And what

16

the Secretary also wants to be sure is that the material is

17

simple and understandable and is therefore, readily accessible

18

to people.

19

Not every applicant will, of course, be accepted.

The Secretary, I don't think, would believe that

20

sending a copy of all the Federal statutes and regulations and

21

Social Security action transmittals and state materials, which

22

would in a way, I suppose, arguably satisfy a literal

23

requirement of the rule, which is what the Eighth Circuit has,

24

the way the Eighth Circuit has read it, would be very helpful

25

to people.

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

21

1

After all, the material should be simple and

2

understandable, because the ability of people to contact their

3

caseworkers may differ.

4

The basic assumption of the system here, is that a

5

person will be able, working with his or her caseworker, to

6

understand how the system affects that person.

7

has felt that it believes that it is not prudent to require

8

that all different types of written material be provided to

9

everyone in the program.

10

The Secretary

The regulation, itself, subsection I, on which the

11

Court of Appeals relied only applies to applicants. And even in

12

that respect, we don't believe that applicants should be

13

flooded with a variety of materials.

14

The Secretary's regulation, we believe, is designed

15

to, or the whole scheme is designed to afford people notice

16

about how this system works, to help them understand what

17

happens when they receive new income.

18
19

Giving them a variety of notice in written form may
be damaging, because they may not understand how it works.

20

Unless the Court has any further questions?

21

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

22

I will hear now from you, Ms. Davison.

Thank you, Mr. Larkin.

23

ORAL ARGUMENT BY LAURIE N. DAVISON, ESQ.

24

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

25

MS. DAVISON:

Heritage

Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

22
1
2

please the Court.
The question before this Court is whether the

3

District Court and the Court of Appeals properly applied a

4

Federal Regulation which requires that certain information be

5

provided in written form. And the regulation explicitly

6

requires that information about conditions of eligibility and

7

the responsibilities of applicants and recipients of assistance

8

be included in that information.

9

Now, the Minnesota Welfare Department does provide

10

certain information in written form. These are the two

11

pamphlets that are in the Joint Appendix, which are given by

12

the Welfare Department to everyone who applies for AFDC.

13

If the Commissioner had added one or two sentences

14

about the lump-sum rule in 1981, or 1982, or 1983, or 1984, we

15

would not be here today. But for some unknown reason, the

16

Commissioner chose not to say a word about the lump-sum rule,

17

in any written information given to anyone who applied for AFDC

18

between October of 1981, when the lump-sum statute went into

19

effect and July of 1985, when the Commissioner complied with

20

the District Court's order requiring that an explanation of the

21

lump-sum rule be provided.

22

QUESTION:

Of course, the particular plaintiff here,

23

if she had contacted her caseworker, as she was supposed to,

24

would have presumably been advised of the rule by her

25

caseworker.

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

23
MS. DAVISON:

1

Ms. Jenkins, Your Honor, did tell the

2

Welfare Department that she was expecting a lump-sum either

3

from Social Security Disability Benefits, or Workers'

4

Compensation Benefits.

5

The record is clear on that point and at no point --

6

QUESTION:

I thought that the record was clear that

7

she did not report the lump-sum payment to her caseworker as

8

she was supposed to.

9
10
11

MS. DAVISON:

No, Your Honor, I think that is not

correct.
What the record indicates is that she got the lump­

12

sum on October 31, 1983, and she was never told that she had to

13

call her worker before she spent it. She was told in writing,

14

in this pamphlet, that what she had to do was to report it in

15

writing on the 8th of the following month, by the 8th of the

16

following month and she did that.

17

The problem for Ms. Jenkins is that because she was

18

facing a mortgage foreclosure, she spent the money, she paid

19

her mortgage before calling her worker.

20

QUESTION:

But it is also --

I thought she — the family also received

21

$16,000 in a workmens' compensation lump-sum benefit which was

22

never reported?

23

MS. DAVISON:

Your Honor, that is part of what the

24

Commissioner is claiming and it is part of an attempt by the

25

state to paint Ms. Jenkins as a cheat and that is simply not

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

24
1

supported by the record.
It is true that she received a lump-sum payment in

2

3

December of 1981, or January of 1982, when she was a recipient

4

of the AFDC benefits. But she says that she did report it.

5

QUESTION:

So you say that is in dispute.

6

In any event, was there some letter sent in 1981,

7

dated September 18, 1981, that made some mention of the lump­

8

sum rule?
MS. DAVISON:

9

Yes, there was, Your Honor.

10

QUESTION:

11

MS. DAVISON: Ms. Jenkins presumably received that,

12
13
14
15
16

And Ms. Jenkins received that?

but she —
QUESTION:

So she did get something other than what

was in that pamphlet?
MS. DAVISON:

She got something when she was a

recipient, Your Honor, in 1981.

17

QUESTION:

Right.

18

MS. DAVISON:

She was not a recipient for some eight

19

months in 1982.

20

benefits in November of 1982, and when she applied for those

21

benefits in 1982 she, like all the other people who applied for

22

benefits, after the lump-sum statute went into effect, got no

23

information about the lump-sum statute.

24
25

She reapplied, she was an applicant for AFDC

Now, the other thing about Ms. Jenkins is that after
getting the September 1981 letter which did mention the lump

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

25
1

sum statute, she got a lump-sum and when she -- and then went

2

off assistance because her husband's workmens' compensation

3

made the family ineligible for welfare.
When she reapplied for AFDC benefits in November of

4
5

1982, she was asked to verify how that lump-sum, the 1981-1982

6

lump-sum was spent, she provided that verification and she was

7

found eligible.
That lump-sum, despite that September 1981 notice was

8

9

treated under the prior lump-sum statute.

10

And so she had every reason to believe that the rule

11

was as it had been in the past — that she could receive lump­

12

sum income, spend it, report it, verify the expenses and then

13

that lump-sum would have no effect on her future eligibility

14

for assistance.

15
16

But the key is that she was an applicant in 1982 and
was given no information about that.

17
18

QUESTION:

there, because there is one fact I am a little puzzled about.

19
20

She was a re-applicant was she, in November of 1982,
having been off the rolls for how long?
MS. DAVISON:

21
22

23
24
25

Ms. Davison, can I interrupt you right

She had been off the rolls for eight

months.
QUESTION:

Well, then was she a recipient in

September of 1981?
MS. DAVISON:

Heritage

She was a recipient in September of

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

26
1

1981.

2

QUESTION:

So she got the September letter?

3

MS. DAVISON:

4

QUESTION:

She got the September letter.

So the fact then, I mean if that were

5

adequate and I know you dispute that, but if that were adequate

6

then she would be on notice of at least the contents of that

7

letter.

8

MS. DAVISON:

9

QUESTION:

10

She was on notice in September of 1981.

Right.

MS. DAVISON:

But then she got a lump-sum that was

11

treated not under the old lump-sum rule, it was not treated

12

under the new lump-sum statute.

13

QUESTION:

14

MS. DAVISON:

15

When did she get that?
In September of 1981 she got the

September letter.

16

QUESTION:

Right.

17

MS. DAVISON:

And in either December of 1981 or

18

January of 1982 she got a lump-sum that was treated when she

19

reapplied in November of 1982, eight months later, it was

20

treated, that previous lump-sum was treated as income in the

21

month received and a resource thereafter that did not affect

22

her future eligibility for AFDC.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

That was because the program did not go

into effect until February of 1982?
MS. DAVISON:

Heritage

Exactly, exactly and the state did

3

nothing to tell -QUESTION:

But she did have notice that lump-sums

were a matter of special interest to the agency.

4

MS. DAVISON:

5

QUESTION:

6

For years the program has reguired --

I understand what it was, but she did have

a duty to report lump-sums.

7

MS. DAVISON:

8

She reported her lump-sum on a timely basis.

9

QUESTION:

10

And she did.

She reported the second lump-sum --

MS. DAVISON:

The first lump-sum is not at issue. The

11

reason that there is a — Justice O'Connor asked about whether,

12

about the $16,000 lump-sum payment, and there is no finding of

13

fact by the District Court on whether or not she reported that

14

lump-sum because it was not relevant to this case.

15
16

She was a new applicant in November of 1982, and got
no information about the lump-sum rule.

She —

17

QUESTION:

Well, I don't understand.

18

On the one hand you seem to be telling me that

19

November 1892 her lump-sum was explained to her and it had been

20

treated under the old rule and therefore, she had a right to

21

rely on it and now you seem to be saying that she did not know

22

anything about it.

23
24
25

MS. DAVISON:

She did not know anything about the new

rule. She was not told that the law had changed.
QUESTION:

Well, she had been told in September of

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

28
1
2

3

1981, though, she had gotten that letter.
MS. DAVISON:
the law had changed.

4

QUESTION:

5

MS. DAVISON:

6

Right.
That letter also said that this is

based on current information and we may change our minds.

7

QUESTION:

8

MS. DAVISON:

9

She was told in September of 1981 that

Well?
But she was told in November of 1981

that there was some change but her experience after receiving

10

that letter told her and would have told anyone that you could

11

spend your lump-sum income on debts, report it, verify it, and

12

you would be eligible —

13

QUESTION:

Now, is the only lump-sum that she

14

received that is relevant, the one that she received between

15

the receipt of the letter and the time she reapplied?

16
17

MS. DAVISON:

She received a lump-sum in October

of 1983, a year after she applied for benefits.

18

QUESTION:

19

MS. DAVISON:

20

No.

And was that lump-sum reported?
It was reported, it was reported two

days after she received it. She was told in writing —

21

QUESTION:

But she already spent it.

22

MS. DAVISON:

-- she had eight days, she had 10 days

23

to report it, or eight days to -- excuse me, or she had until

24

eight days into the following month to report it.

25

QUESTION:

And the problem was

Heritage

that she had already

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

29

1

spent it in those two days, that is right, I remember it now.

2

MS. DAVISON:

Exactly.

3

And the Welfare Department knew that she was

4

expecting a workers' compensation check or a Social Security

5

disability check and yet, even with that knowledge, they told

6

her nothing about her obligations under the statute to budget

7

and use that money to pay for her family's ordinary living

8

expenses.
What the District Court did here is to say to the

9
10

Commissioner, Commissioner you violated the regulation, correct

11

that violation.

12

by the District Court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals.

That was the sum total of the burden imposed

And I want to make it very clear what this case is

13
14

not about.

15

lump-sum statute. The Court did not hold that any class member

16

was eligible for benefits because they did not get an

17

explanation from some statute.

18

The Court did not enjoin implementation of the

We are not arguing that an explanation of the statute

19

was a condition precedent to the application of the lump-sum

20

statute. That is not our position.

21

QUESTION:

Ms. Davison, your opponent says that the

22

District Court in the Eighth Circuit required payments to be

23

made to your clients which were contrary to the Congressional

24

authorization.

25

What is your response to that?

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

30
ft

1

MS. DAVISON:

2

is not what the Court required.

3

That is not correct, Your Honor, that

Kathryn Jenkins got AFDC benefits during her period

4

of ineligibility. Not because of anything that the District

5

Court did, but because she filed an administrative appeal and

6

Federal Regulations require that you get continued benefits

7

pending an administrative appeal decision.

8
9

What the District Court did, or what the Court of
Appeals did, was conclude that there had been a violation of

10

law, there had been a violation of the regulation that required

11

an explanation of the lump-sum statute.

12

violation, the Court had the authority to fashion a remedy for

13

Kathryn Jenkins and the remedy that was fashioned was an

14

injunction against the state recovering a $5,000 overpayment.

15
16

QUESTION:

Even though it was clearly an overpayment

under the Act of Congress?

17

MS. DAVISON:

18

QUESTION:

19
20
21
22

And that given that

That is right. It was an overpayment.

What authority did the Eighth Circuit cite

for that proposition?

What of our cases?

MS. DAVISON:

The Eighth Circuit did not make clear,

Judge Arnold did not make clear the basis for that order.
To the extent that the opinion suggests that the

23

basis for that equitable order is that the statute did not take

24

effect and we disavow that position.

25

It is our position that the

Heritage

Court has traditional

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

31

1

equitable powers to fashion remedy when there has been a

2

violation of law, and there was a violation of law in this

3

case. That there is no statute that -QUESTION:

4
5

There was a violation of the regulation,

as you contend.

6

MS. DAVISON:

The regulation, that is right.

7

There is nothing, there is no statute which deprives

8

the Court of the equitable power to fashion a remedy and the

9

Court properly exercised its discretion in fashioning the

10

remedy.
QUESTION:

11

Ms. Davison, the statute not only deprived

12

her of eligibility but there is also an explicit provision in

13

the statute requiring recoupment of overpayments, isn't there?
The Court, in effect, fashioned a remedy that

14
15

overrode that provision.
MS. DAVISON:

16

There is, Your Honor, a statute which

17

governs the relationship between the State and the Federal

18

Government.

19

in the administration of its AFDC program, that the State must

20

have in its state plan a provision that overpayments will be

21

recovered.

It says that if a state wants to get federal funds

22

QUESTION:

I see.

23

MS. DAVISON:

But that statute does not purport

24

either in expressed or implicit terms to limit the traditional

25

equitable powers of the Federal Court.

Heritage

And as this Court ruled

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

32
1

in Heckler v. Day, even the Court in Heckler v. Day found that

2

it was clear from Congressional history that Congress did not

3

want a Court to impose time limits on the Secretary in deciding

4

Social Security benefits, but that the Court, in a footnote

5

said, despite our conclusion, nothing in this decision limits a

6

Federal Court from applying equitable principles in an

7

individual case, to apply time limits in an individual case and

8

to award benefits if the time limits are not kept.
QUESTION:

9

I have tried to think of an analog of some

10

other case I could come up with where the Court has fashioned a

11

remedy that specifically allows somebody to do something which

12

a statute prohibits.

13

And I can't think of one, can you?

14

And I did not see any in your brief. Do you know any

15

other example, where a Court has said, because somebody has

16

violated a regulation or because of some other rule, we are

17

going to say you can ignore the statute?
MS. DAVISON:

18

Well, Your Honor, in Goldberg v. Kelly

19

the Court said that there must be a right to a due process

20

hearing before benefits are terminated.

21

QUESTION:

22

MS. DAVISON:

23
24
25

That is a Constitutional problem.
That is a Constitutional case, Your

Honor.
But nonetheless, some of those people would not have
been eligible for benefits and at the time, there was no

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

33

1

provision for recovering overpayments when the overpayment was

2

caused not by the client error.
And so, as a matter of fact, what happened in that

3
4

case is that people who may not have been eligible were awarded

5

benefits. That is the closest analogy that I can come up with.
There may be other cases, Your Honor, but I am not

6
7

aware of them.
QUESTION:

8
9

May I go back for a moment to the

-- your

claim depends on there having been a violation of law by the

10

state administrator, at the time of the second application in

11

November of 1982, by failure to explain the lump-sum

12

requirement.

13
14
15

Would in your view, would it have been satisfactory
to

explain that requirement orally?
MS. DAVISON:

No, because the Secretary's regulation

16

says that the information must be provided in writing and

17

orally as appropriate.

18

If the Secretary --

19

QUESTION:

Well, what it says is in writing about

20

coverage conditions of eligibility, scope of the program, and

21

related services available.

22

in precisely what detail that information has to be given in.

23

MS. DAVISON:

I suppose there is some ambiguity

If there is any ambiguity, Your Honor,

24

it seems to me that it is about what information has to be

25

provided but not whether it has to be in writing or whether it

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

34

1

can be simply oral information.

2

QUESTION:

Right.

3

MS. DAVISON:

So the question of whether or not it

4

has to be in writing, I think, has to be answered in the

5

affirmative.

6

said.

7

policy matter it is more effective to impart information orally

8

than in writing, the Secretary is free to amend that

9

regulation.

Now, if the Secretary, in his judgment, feels that as a

11

It has to be because that is what the Secretary

application, your client got a pamphlet was it that -

MS. DAVISON:

QUESTION:

MS. DAVISON:

Appendix.

That is right, two pamphlets.

Not a word.

No mention of lump-sum?
No mention.

But, Ms. Jenkins had received the

September 18, 1981 letter which did mention the new rule.
MS. DAVISON:

That is right, but she got nothing at

the time that she was an applicant.
It --

35

QUESTION:

1

Let's assume -- so it would not make any

2

difference in your position if the letter she got when she was

3

a recipient was adequate notice?

4

MS. DAVISON:

5

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

So you would say that letter is just

6

irrelevant because she should have had another notice when she

7

reapplied?
MS. DAVISON:

8
9

That letter is totally irrelevant to

the claim the Plaintiff and her class as to whether the

10

regulation was violated.

It is not irrelevant to the question

11

of balancing of the equities and fashioning relief to the

12

Plaintiff Jenkins.
It would be appropriate for the Court to have

13
14

considered the fact that she had gotten this notice, just as it

15

would be appropriate for the Court to consider the fact that

16

she got a lump-sum after that, which was treated under the old

17

rule, not the new rule.
But her rights were violated as an applicant, as were

18
19

the other class members.

20

QUESTION:

Because she got no notice then?

21

MS. DAVISON:

Because she got no notice then, even

22

though the Welfare Department knew that she was anticipating

23

the receipt of a Social Security check or Workers' Compensation

24

check.

MS. DAVISON:

She got both of those.

Okay.
And it is not true as Mr. Kirwin

7

suggested that these pamphlets only explain eligibility which

8

are applicable to everyone on the program.
One of the eligibility requirements explained in the

9
10

pamphlet, I think it is A-29, is that you, one of the child's

11

parents has to have an illness which lasts at least 30 days.

12

That is an eligibility requirement for benefits under the AFDC

13

program for families who are incapacitated or one member is

14

incapacitated. And they are less than 2 percent or about 2

15

percent of the entire AFDC population on that particular

16

program.

17

The lump-sum rule is applicable across the board in

18

the same way that this is applicable across the board.

19

affects people who have an incapacitated parent.

20

rule only affects people who happen to receive lump-sum income.

21

It only

The lump-sum

But it only has direct implication for a relatively

22

small percentage of the AFDC population.

23

eligibility condition that has to be explained to people, it is

24

the lump-sum rule. It is not a case, this is not a case about

25

some abstract interest in information.

When Congress enacted the lump-sum statute, it was

1
2

for the express purpose of imposing the responsibility on AFDC

3

recipients of budgeting lump-sum income and to use it on

4

ordinary living expenses in lieu of AFDC.
Now, that simply is not going to happen unless people

5
6

know of that responsibility.

And AFDC recipients even in

Minnesota live substantially below the poverty level.

15

That may be a month after the family got the lump­

It is especially unfair to somebody like Kathryn

16

Jenkins and other people who had reason to believe that they

17

could spend lump-sum income on legitimate debts and that it

18

would not affect their future eligibility for assistance.

19

And the Commissioner agreed, excuse me, the Secretary

20

agreed in answers to interrogatories that the operation of the

21

lump-sum statute had to be explained.

22

QUESTION:

Of course most people don't get

23

explanations of changes in law.

I mean, there have been

24

massive changes in the Internal Revenue Code for example and my

friendly revenue agent has not advised me what changes there

are going to be.
Now, to be sure, that just applies to matters that

3

are not as crucial as getting subsistence payments, but

4

nonetheless, it is the principle of our law that it is up to

5

you to find out what your entitlements are.

6

MS. DAVISON:

But we have here, a Federal Regulation

7

which says that you do tell people about the eligibility

8

conditions, you do tell them what their responsibilities are.

9

And this is clearly a responsibility. That is what the

10

Secretary said to Congress and that is what the Secretary said

11

in regulations implemented in the lump-sum statute.

12

responsibility of caretakers.

13

QUESTION:

Do we have to agree with

This is a

you that

14

applicant and recipient are one and the same in order to agree

15

with you about the regulation?

16
17

Or is part of your claim that she did not get a
notice when she was a new applicant is that --

18

MS. DAVISON:

That is right.

19

No, I think you don't have to agree with me that

20

applicants and recipients mean the same thing.

21

about whether the regulation applies to recipients as well as

22

applicants is really a very narrow issue and affects only a

23

very minor part of this case.

24
25

The whole issue

The District Court ordered that a explanation of the
lump-sum statute be given to people who were then recipients of

✓

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

39
1
2

AFDC because as applicants they had not gotten any information.
That was accomplished in November of 1985 and is

3

moot. The Court ordered that new applicants be given this

4

explanation at the time of application and the

5

applicant/recipient argument would not affect that relief.

6

7

The Court also argued that the explanation be given
every six months, at the time of redetermination.

8

What this whole argument boils down to --

9

QUESTION:

10

That does not affect the one remaining

named Plaintiff, anyway?

11

MS. DAVISON:

That is right.

12

I would also like to make clear as to the question

13

about the named Plaintiff and the standing of the named

14

Plaintiff, and her adequacy as a class representative, is that

15

there are other class members.

16

If she is not an adequate class representative, then

17

the case could have been remanded for the substitution of a

18

different Plaintiff.

19

So that even if the Court feels that the September

20

1981 notice affects her standing, then it should have been

21

remanded for someone else to intervene on behalf of the class.

22

The question of whether or not recipients are

23

entitled to benefits boils down to whether the State is

24

required to send one piece of paper which is already prepared

25

to people who are already getting information at their six

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

40
1

month eligibility determination so that it is really a very

2

minor issue in the case.
And since the Commissioner never made this argument

3
4

to the District Court or to the Court of Appeals, it certainly

5

can be affirmed as an appropriate form of relief.
They never claimed that there was any burden and

6
7

there certainly isn't any burden.

8

Now, the Commissioner --

9

QUESTION:

Excuse me, I gather that your point is

10

that the requirement for oral consultation is not adequate

11

because you are not required to contact your caseworker

12

immediately upon receiving the lump-sum payment, is that it?

13

MS. DAVISON:

14

QUESTION:

That is right.

So that between the time you receive it

15

and the 8th of the next month, or 10 days, whichever is longer

16

is that --

17

MS. DAVISON:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

Whichever is shorter.

Whichever is shorter, you can blow the

whole thing and then it is too late.
MS. DAVISON:

That is right. And the first answer,

21

Your Honor, is that the Secretary says it has to be in writing,

22

but I agree with the Secretary's determination because the

23

system works on written communication, that is how it is set

24

up. And it is not adequate to wait until the information is

25

reported and it is reported in writing by the 8th of the

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

41

'

1

following month. And then the Welfare Department only has to

2

send a termination notice 10 days before the end of, 10 days

3

before the beginning of the following month.
So, a lot of time can elapse.

4

And it is also very

5

difficult to reach your financial worker.

6

is busy and people don't have telephones. The system, unlike

7

the previous case, which did not reflect the real world, this

8

case does reflect the real world, and in the real world of the

9

Welfare Department, Welfare Administration, it makes sense to

10

Very often the phone

require that this information be provided in writing.

11

The Commissioner complains that the decision of the

12

Court of Appeals left too many unanswered questions about the

13

scope and applicability of this Federal Regulation.

14

If the Court had written a broad decision trying to

15

anticipate all of the questions that might arise, as to the

16

applicability of the regulation, and answered those questions,

17

then the Commissioner would have a valid basis for complaining

18

that as the Commissioner does complain, that the Court over

19

stepped its judicial bounds, and interfered with the

20

administration of the Welfare Department.

21

That is not what happened here.

Judge Arnold

22

answered the questions that were raised by the complaint in a

23

reasoned and principled manner and if there are questions that

24

require answers, the answers should be provided by the

25

Secretary.

42
QUESTION:

1

Let me just ask one other question about

2

the specific violation of the regulation was that you treat the

3

lump-sum as a condition of eligibility that should have been

4

explained, is that right?
The pamphlets are okay on coverage and scope of the

5
6

program but this one condition of eligibility is not adequately

7

explained or is it that the responsibilities of the recipients

8

are not adequately explained?
MS. DAVISON:

9

I think it is both, because the lump­

10

sum rule, unlike the vast majority of other rules, is not only

11

a condition of eligibility but also in order to effectuate

12

Congress' intent, imposes responsibilities on welfare

13

recipients.
And that is one way that the Court of Appeals

14
15

narrowed its decision and this Court could, too, that not all

16

eligibility requirements impose responsibilities on recipients

17

to take affirmative action.
QUESTION:

18

And here, she knew she had to report but

19

she did not know that she had to report before she spent the

20

money?

21

MS. DAVISON:

That is right.

22

And she did not know, even if she had reported,

23

before she spent the money, she may or may not have been told,

24

right then, what she could do with it.

25

QUESTION:

But it seems to me that your case must

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

43
1

depend on the assumption that she would have been told, because

2

then the failure of her to report — I mean telling her the

3

responsibility would not have done any good.
MS. DAVISON:

4

What we think she should have been told

5

under the Federal Regulation is, in one sentence as this Court

6

indicated in Lukhard, the lump-sum rule requires that if you

7

receive lump-sum income you will be rendered ineligible for the

8

number of months that it would take you to use the lump-sum

9

spending each month no more than your welfare grant.
That is what she was required under the regulation to

10
11

be told.
QUESTION:

12

Well, the letter pretty much said that but

13

that it is not in so many words, I realize. But it made it

14

clear that she could be ineligible for a period of months,

15

which would be a change from the old rule.
MS. DAVISON:

16

If they had given her this letter, that

17

letter, in November of 1982, or given that letter to anybody

18

who applied for AFDC benefits, any time between the

19

implementation of the lump-sum statute, we wouldn't be here.

20

They did not give that letter to anyone other than

21

people who were then recipients in September of 1981. They did

22

not give it to her and they did not give it to the 200,000

23

families who applied for benefits.
This Court doesn't have to judge the adequacy of that

24
25

letter.

QUESTION:

you that the Court can give, can prevent the requirement that

that this information be included?

How can I do that though, because who

would have had standing?

to get that relief. That relief does her no good.

MR. KIRWIN:
QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Mr. Kirwin, may I ask you to tell us what

3

written notice was given to applicants for welfare before 1985

4

about the lump-sum rule, in writing?

5
6

MR. KIRWIN:
from 1981 to 1985.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. KIRWIN:

9

Before 1985, Your Honor, for the period

Yes, in writing.
Okay, applicants weren't given any

written information concerning the lump-sum rule with this

10

exception: that applicants filled out the application form,

11

filled out the forms for redetermination of eligibility and

12

there are some examples of those in the Joint Appendix. They

13

are missing $16,000 that was not reported on the forms that

14

called for it.

15

Those forms specifically listed lump-sum income and

16

so that applicants knew, even though they may not have known

17

precisely how it would be treated, they certainly knew that

18

lump-sum income was something that had some bearing on their

19

AFDC eligibility.

20
21

QUESTION:

But got no specific written notice about

it until as a result of this lawsuit?

MR. KIRWIN:

6

Concerning the lump-sum statute?
Concerning the lump-sum rule?
We very strongly disagree with that,

Your Honor.

7

The Plaintiffs, the Respondents in their brief,

8

concede that the regulation doesn't require that descriptions

9

be given of all eligibility requirements. They say that and

10

they say that the lower Court did not say that.
But they say that it would be a good idea that there

11

12

is something special about the lump-sum statute. The lump-sum

13

statute certainly has an impact on those families that are

14

affected by it.

on the families that are affected by them.

Other eligibility requirements have an impact

that and I was perhaps too glib before in saying that the

was because the Secretary tried to describe obligations under
