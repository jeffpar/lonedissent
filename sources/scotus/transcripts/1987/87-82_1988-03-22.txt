ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN C. HARRISON, ESQUIRE

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

10

MR. HARRISON:

Thank you, Chief Justice

11

Rehnquist.

12

from a judgment of the United States District Court for the

13

Northern District of Iowa.

14

tutional 12 U.S.C . 1818(g) and enjoined the FDIC from

IS

enforcing it against appellee Mallen.

16

May it please the Court, this is a direct appeal

The District Court held unconsti­

Under Section 1818(g), when an officer of a

17

federally insured bank is indicted for a felony involving

18

dishonesty or breach of trust, the appropriate federal

19

banking agency, in the case of this bank the FDIC , may

20

suspend him from office and order him not to participate

21

further in the conduct of the affairs of the bank pending

22

the resolution of the criminal charges if it determines that

23

his continued service would pose a threat to the interests

24

of depositors or threaten to impair public confidence in

25

the bank.

Because of the risks posed to the bank and to
public confidence by the presence there of an officer who
has been indicated, the FDIC may under the statute impose
a suspension immediately, as soon as the indictment is
authorized.

Once the suspension has been ordered, the

statute gives the suspended officer the right to request an
opportunity to be heard before the agency and to show that
his

return to the bank would not threaten the interests that

the statute seeks to protect.
If he makes that request, his opportunity to appear
must be given him within 30 days, and then once he has had
the opportunity to be heard, the agency must decide within
60 days whether or not to terminate, modify, or continue
the suspension.

When he makes his appearance before the

agency, the officer may submit written material and oral
argument, and in the discretion of the agency, oral evidence.
The District Court found that the suspension
procedures that I have just outlined were unconstitutional
and enjoined the FDIC from enforcing them because of the

22

90-day time period that is allowed for the agency's decision

23

after the suspension is ordered and because the agency has

24

discretion as to whether to accept oral testimony.

25

ground of decision was correct.

and for the decision after the hearing had to accommodate

the competing interests,

interest in having a prompt disposition of his possible

5

return to the bank and the public interest in making sure

6

that the indicted officer is not returned to the bank until

7

the FDIC has had a chance to satisfy itself that it would

8

be safe to do so because, of course, he has been indicted.

Mr. Harrison, why are we examining
This is a facial challenge that we

15

MR. HARRISON:

16

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Why is that?

As I understand it, he

17

didn't go through the whole process anyway, and it is Quite

18

possible that the government would have given him his

19

hearing within 17 days or something like that.

20

MR.:HARRISON:

The hearing had been scheduled for

21

a date 19 days after he requested it. It never was held

22

because it was enjoined, the entire process was enjoined by

23

the District Court the day before the hearing would have

24

been held, so we don't know how long it would have taken the

25

agency to decide the case.

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

5

1

QUESTION:

Well, is it the government's position

2

that it is proper to attack the statute on its face in those

3

circumstances?

4
5

MR. HARRISON:

We think that the statute clearly

survives a facial challenge.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. HARRISON:

That is not what I asked, though.
And that it is unusual for the

8

District Court to decide that the statutory process is

9

completely meaningless, that it does not provide meaningful

10

review because of the time that is permitted by the

11

statute.

12

QUESTION:

That is still not what I asked.

Is

13

this a proper facial challenge?

14

far as we can tell there is no assurance here that this

15

individual would have been deprived of due process, even

16

accepting his contentions as to what due process requires?

17

MR. HARRISON:

Why shouldn't we say as

That would be a sound ground for

18

decision, yes.

19

the question' until it had seen what the acrency would have

20

done and would have determined whether he would have had a

21

hearing that would have taken place within a time period

22

that the District Court would have regarded --

The District Court should not have reached

QUESTION:

Mr. Harrison, I guess this respondent

was later convicted in a criminal proceeding.
MR. HARRISON:

That's correct.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

2

QUESTION:

And that conviction is on appeal,

is it?

3

MR. HARRISON:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. HARRISON:

6

QUESTION:

7

It is.

Has the Eighth Circuit ruled yet?
It has not.

If it were to do so, is this case

moot?

8

MR. HARRISON:

Once the criminal process for

9

Mallen is exhausted the case may become moot.

10

entirely clear whether it does because of the possible

11

relationship between the suspension proceedings and any

12

future removal proceedings which can also be instituted

13

under Section 1818(g), but the case might well be moot after

14

a decision in the criminal proceeding.

15

QUESTION:

It is not

Well, I take it what you mean in answer

16

to that question is, after the direct appeal in the criminal

17

proceeding becomes final, not after the Eighth Circuit rules,

18

but after a petition for rehearing time, petition for

19

certiorari time has gone by.

20

MR. HARRISON:

21

judgment becomes final.

22
23

QUESTION:

Yes, that's right.

Once the

And the United States appealed, too,

didn't it?

24

MR. HARRISON:

25

QUESTION:

Yes, we did.

And if dismissal of that

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

7

1

count is reversed, there may be another trial.

2
3

MR. HARRISON:

That's right.

So

the case may go on for a while.
QUESTION:

4
5

That's right.

Are they holding the case up for

this argument, or was it just recently argued?
MR. HARRISON:

6

It was argued in December in the

7

Eighth Circuit, and as far as I know it is not being held

8

pending resolution of this case.

9

The balancing of interests that the due process

10

clause requires, we feel, clearly demonstrates that the

11

90-day period that Congress allowed is a sensible amount

12

of time. The public interest is very heavy, and of course,

13

although Mallen's interest is significant, it is outweighed

14

by the need to protect the banking system.

15

The 30-day period that is permitted --

16

QUESTION:

17
18
19

Mr. Harrison, is his suspension without

pay?
MR. HARRISON:

No, the statute does not provide

that the suspension is without pay.

20

QUESTION:

So he has been receiving it during --

21

MR. HARRISON:

I believe while the bank was open

22

the bank continued to pay him, and there is certainly

23

nothing in the statute to prevent that.

24
25

The 30 days gives the FDIC the opportunity in a
case where it knows nothing more than what it knew from the

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

8

1

indictment to investigate the situation to be prepared to

2

answer whatever showing the officer is expected to make.

3

QUESTION:

What happens if the criminal conviction

4

becomes final?

5

probably in jail, but how about his pay then?

6

Where does he stand then?

MR. HARRISON:

Well, he has served his sentence

7

and is currently on probation.

8

The Iowa Banking Authority closed --

9

QUESTION:

10

MR. HARRISON;

I know he is

The bank is now closed.

I see.
— because it became insolvent, so

11

he is no longer employed there anyway, but -- and -- and he

12

wouldn't be employed by the bank because of a different

13

statute.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Harrison, are you sure a bank

15

wouldn't be in trouble with its shareholders or indeed

16

perhaps even with federal regulatory authorities if it

17

continued to pay an officer who was not performing any

18

services ?

19

I mean, you say the statute doesn't require that

20

his pay be cut off, but why in the world should a bank

21

continue to pay somebody, who is unable to perform?

22

MR. HARRISON:

It is entirely possible that either

23

the bank shareholders or management or state or federal

24

regulatory authorities might object to paving a suspended

25

officer.

That is correct.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

In addition to investigating the situation in the

Yes, that's true.

But the primary justification for giving the FDIC

14

as much as 60 days to make its decision as to whether to

15

return the officer once he has been indicted to the bank is

16

the danger of sending him back and the fact that in the most

17

difficult case the FDIC may have a hard choice to make.

18

The FDIC and the system of banking regulation

25

That is

That is what makes

So it is extremely important that the FDIC be very
sure that it is doing the right thing if it is going to let
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

10

1
2

the officer go back to the bank.
On the other hand, the officer in the most difficult

3

case may have made a strong showing that there are unique

4

facts explaining why despite the indictment which normally

5

would lead him to be suspended it would be safe in that par­

6

ticular case for him to go back to the bank.

7

in the case in which the statute has to be judged on a

8

facial challenge will have to be making a decision that is

9

hard to make, a difficult decision, and in which the down side

10

risk is very serious of letting the officer go back.

11

Thus the FDIC

Sixty days is, as this Court recoanized in cases

12

like Thirty-Seven Photographs, an expedited time period

13

within which to make a decision anyway, and so it was, we

14

think, quite unsound for the District Court to suggest that

15

Congress acted unreasonably in saying that the FDIC could

16

have as much as 60 days if it needed it, and of course, as

17

has been suggested, we do not know how long it would have

18

taken to make the decision as to Mallen.

19

Now, the District Court did not decide that 90 days

20

was an unreasonable period of time because it thought that

21

the balance between,the competing interests shifted in favor

22

of Mallen or because it just couldn't see a reason to need

23

90 days to have the hearing and then make the decision.

24

Rather, it analogized the case, unsoundly, we

25

think, to this Court's decision in Barry against Barchi.

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

11

1

In Barry, a horse trainer had been suspended for allegedly

2

drugging a horse.

3

imposed for 15 days, and it ended after 15 days.

4

State Racing Commission had 30 days within which to

5

hold its hearing on the suspended trainer to decide whether

6

to -- not to impose the suspension, and then there was no

7

set time period for it to make its decision.

8

The suspension was a penal suspension
The

So the way the system was set up in Barry against

9

Barchi, it was possible that a penal suspension would end

10

on its own, would terminate automatically before any hearing

11

was held, but the analogy does not hold up.

12

Court thought was that since the criminal process might make

13

its decision and thus determine whether or not Mallen could

14

go back to the bank before the FDIC had a chance to hold its

15

hearing and make its decision under 1818(g), that somehow

16

rendered the Section 1818(g) process meaningless, but the

17

difference between the cases is that here Mallen receives

18

review of the FDIC's decision to suspend through both the

19

processes.

20

If he is acquitted, of course, the suspension terminates.

21

the FDIC on the basis of his showing decides that, yes, this

22

is an unusual case in which it would be safe to allow him to

23

come back to the bank, the decision terminates, but review is

24

not cut off.

25

What the District

Either one can bring the suspension to an end.

The situation is not at all like Barry against

(202) 628-4888

If

12

Barchi.

Also, of course, the District Court's empirical

assumption that as a general rule the criminal process
would terminate the suspension before the FDIC process
did, which was based on the District Court's thinking that
the suspension only ran until jury verdict rather than until
the end of the criminal process was simply incorrect.
As we have seen, as we were discussing a moment
ago, the criminal process is still going on now, and indeed

9

it is possible if the United States prevails on its appeal
10
11

13

15
16
17
18

20
21

25

that there will have to be another trial, and so the -I am sorry.

If the United States prevails on its appeal the

jury verdict will be reinstated.

I apolcbgize.

That means

that my earlier answer was incorrect.
In any event, it has now been more than a year
since Mallen was suspended, and the criminal process is
still going on.
The District Court also held that the hearing that
is provided under Section 1818(g) is not a meaningful
process, is not meaningful review because the agency has
discretion, and in this case the discretion is delegated to
a hearing officer to decide whether to allow Mallen to
introduce oral evidence, testimony in addition to the written
materials and the oral argument that he has a statutory
right to introduce.
Now, this Court has never held that as a general

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

13

1

matter due process creates a right to testify, to put on

2

evidence, to put on oral evidence as opposed to a right to

3

be heard, and Mallen, of course, has a right fully to be heard

4

to present the written statements of any individuals whose

5

testimony he thinks would be relevant.

6

QUESTION:

And of course, as was suggested earlier

7

from the bench, we will never know in this case whether the

8

agency would have allowed him to produce oral testimony

9

because he didn't allow it to come to that.

10

MR. HARRISON:

That is entirely correct.

It is

11

the general practice of these hearings for oral testimony

12

to be taken from both sides and for cross examination to be

13

conducted.

14

before the hearing was going to be held, presumably the day

15

before, therefore, the hearing officer would have decided

16

whether or not he was going to admit oral testimony.

17

very least it would have been appropriate if this is what

18

concerned the District Court for the District Court to wait

19

and see what had happened, to wait and see if there had been

20

any deprivation of the kind of hearing that the Court thought

21

was constitutionally required, or if that was not enough, at

22

least to order the hearing, if the court thought it was

23

necessary for some reason to decide the issue before it had

24

seen what the agency was going to do, to order that oral

25

evidence be accepted, but certainly not to decide the case

The District Court issued its injunction the day

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

At the

14

1

the way the District Court did, which was simply to strike

2

down the statute, to reach out to find it unconstitutional

3

on the basis of something that might never have happened, but

4

it didn't know whether it was going to happen, and that in

5

any event could have been cured.

6
7

If the Court has no further questions, I will
reserve the remainder of my time.

8

QUESTION:

Can I ask you just -- what does the

9

government decide in these cases?

10

at this hearing?

11

of the matter on which he has been indicted have anything

12

to do with the determination?

13

What is it looking for

Does the degree of probability of guilt

MR. HARRISON:

Absolutely not.

The only questions

14

that the FDIC considers have to do with banking regulations,

15

have to do with the protection of the interests of

16

depositors and the threat to public confidence that is posed

17

by having an indicted officer serving at the bank.

18

FDIC is looking in hearing the officer on his opportunity

19

to respond, is looking for the officer to give some reason

20

why, despite the normal expectation that is created in an

21

indictment

22

after indictment virtually routine, for some showing of some

23

unique situation that prevails in that particular bank,

24

why there is extremely heavy supervision of the officer,

25

for example.

QUESTION:

2

MR. HARRISON:

Has it ever -- an officer unsuspended?
Since the 1978 amendments that are

3

under consideration in this case, I believe it has not.

4

There may have been at least one case under the old version

5

of Section 1818(g) when someone was indicted and not

6

suspended, but it is, as Congress thought it would be,

7

virtually routine to suspend an indicted officer.

MS. CURTIN:

Mr. Chief Justice Rehnguist, and may

it please the Court, as this Court has often stated, due

process requires some kind of hearing, and that that

of a hearing at a meaningful time.

23

and I believe we have a fact question here, Mr. Mallen was

not going to have a hearing.

There is no statutory assurance
As a mattter of fact,

In response to some questions asked by the Court,

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

16

1

the notice to suspend Mr. Mallen was issued on January 20th,

2

1986.

3

30th, Mr. Mallen1s attorney requested an immediate hearing.

4

The statute says, the hearing will take place within 30

5

days, the decision will be rendered within an additional 60.

6

On January 30th Mr. Mallen's attorney requested an immediate

7

hearing on February 9.

8

It was served upon him on January 26th.

On January

Mr. Mallen's criminal trial at this point was

9

scheduled to commence on March 16th.

10

correspondence between the agency and Mr. Mallen's attorney

11

it was finally resolved by the agency that they would afford

12

Mr. Mallen his hearing some time on February 20th.

13

agency refused to make any representations whatsoever as to

14

how much of the additional 60 days the agency would take or

15

require in order to render a decision.

16

February 20th is April 20th, which is approximately a month

17

after Mr. Mallen's criminal trial has ended.

18

In a series of

The

Sixty days from

When the Federal District Court declared the

19

statute unconstitutional on February 17 of 1987, the FDIC

20

asked the judge to reconsider the decision, and at that point

21

said they would afford Mr. Mallen an expedited hearing and an

22

expedited decision.

23

Judge O'Brien would have given Mr. Mallen a decision on his

24

case on April 8th, which was approximately three weeks after

25

his criminal trial ended.

The dates presented by the FDIC to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

The date of the criminal trial is important because

2

the criminal trial, regardless of the way it is resolved,

3

avoids the necessity of convening any hearing at all or if

4

the hearing has been convened but a decision has not been

5

rendered, it avoids the necessity of rendering a decision.

6

Had Mr. Mallen been acquitted, the suspension would have

7

dissolved of its own weight pursuant to the language of the

8

statute.

9

Mr. Mallen was convicted.

When an individual is

10

convicted of a crime, another statute, 12 U.S.S. 1829, says

disagree on when that other statute becomes operative.
MS. CURTIN:

No, Your Honor, we don't, and the

19

reason we don't is because when Mr. Mallen was convicted the

20

FDIC brought an action which you will see referenced, I

21

believe, in our brief, FDIC versus Mallen, to immediately

22

require Mr. Mallen's suspension from the bank pursuant to

23

12 U.S.C. 1829.

24
25

QUESTION:

Do I not understand that they now take

the position that the conviction won't be final until after

his appeal?

2

MS. CURTIN:

Well, Your Honor, they are taking

3

the position, as I understand it, that the conviction isn't

4

final until after his appeal, but the language of 1829 does

5

not say that you shall be removed when your conviction is

final.

7

period.

8

It says you shall be removed when you are convicted,

I argued the case concerning the application of

9

12 U.S.C. 1829.

10

in this now -- that Section 1829 should not operate to remove

11

Mr. Mallen until the appeal, notwithstanding the language

12

of the statute.

13

contemplated an immediate termination upon conviction

14

notwithstanding appeal.

15
16
17
18
19

20

I took the position -- there is some humor

The FDIC argued that Section 1829 clearly

The federal judge ruled in favor of the FDIC and
Mr. Mallen was immediately terminated.

It wasn't Mr. Harrison down there,

though, was it, anyway?
MS. CURTIN:

It was Mr. -- no, it wasn't

Mr. Harrison.

QUESTION:

(General laughter.)

23

MS. CURTIN:

That's nice.

I am just saying now we have all

24

changed sides, but there is a court case that specifically

25

interprets that statute, the only one that I am aware of,
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

19

1

Your Honor, and it ruled in favor of the FDIC's position that

2

the conviction, the entry of the conviction operated to

3

terminate the individual's ability to work not just in the

4

Kanawha Bank, where Mr. Mallen was employed, but any bank

5

whose deposits are insured.

6

There is some reference to the reading of those

7

statutes together, their differences and their similarities,

8

in our brief.

9

QUESTION:

Do you think that the District Court

10

was proper to decide this on a facial challenge rather than

11

to wait and see what happened?

12

MS. CURTIN:

It was very clear, Your Honor, and

13

some of this -- all of this correspondence, I believe, is

14

in the appendix that we were not going to get a hearing

15

from the FDIC where a decision would have been rendered even

16

close to when Mr. Mallen's criminal trial had been over.

17

Had that been possible, we would have continued, obviously,

18

to proceed in an attempt to have the issue resolved, but no

19

dates suggested by the FDIC before or after Judge O'Brien

20

ruled on the constitutionality of the statute would have

21

afforded us a decision within even three weeks of his

22

conviction.

23

QUESTION:

Well, let's assume that's correct, but

24

why should the District Court declare the statute

25

unconstitutional?

If it is his view that under these

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

20

circumstances the FDIC operating under the statute did not
give your client a timely hearing, why shouldn't he simply

manner?

MS. CURTIN:

I read Judge O'Brien's decision,

Chief Justice Rehnquist, to indicate that he felt that the
statute was applied in an unconstitutional manner.

I read

him to go farther, however, and say because of the FDIC's
refusal to accommodate the time periods of the Speedy Trial
Act, it was reasonable to conclude that not just Mr. Mallen
but any individual who invoked his constitutional right to
a speedy trial would not have a hearing by the FDIC on this
issue.
We were forced to choose between our constitutional
right to a speedy trial and what Judge O'Brien and I felt
were our constitutional right to a hearing post-suspension.
We could not have both.

That was extremely clear from the

posture of this case from the beginning, and given the FDIC's
repeated assertions that it is just impossible for them to
convene and dispose of a case like this within 70 days, no
one is going to have their hearing if they insist upon their
parallel right to a speedy trial.
QUESTION:

How about the District Court's ruling

coupling his reservations about the timeliness with the fact
that the FDIC would not automatically have admitted oral

21

testimony?

2

to wait and see what happened at the hearing, would he not?

3

Surely there he wohld have been better advised

I mean, this is not a First Amendment case.

We

4

just don't ordinarily have facial attacks on this kind of

5

statute.

6

MS. CURTIN:

In anticipation of this question, I

7

read a number of cases that attempted to distinguish a facial

8

challenge to a statute from a statute that was unconstitu­

9

tional as applied, and I am afraid I have to admit to this

10

Court that I concluded that there was an extremely gray area

11

in the middle, and I will tell you quite candidly I am not

12

sure if this is a facial challenge to the statute or if it

13

was just unconstitutional as applied.

14

Justice, that when it was all over with, my client had no

15

hearing, and my client was never going to have a hearing.

16

QUESTION:

But I do know, Chief

Well, outside of the First Amendment

17

area, if a statute is to be held unconstitutional on its

18

face, wouldn't it be true that it could never be any

19

circumstances constitutionally applied?

20

MS. CURTIN:

From the cases I read, yes, in order

21

for it to be a facial challenge to a statute, my under­

22

standing was that there were no set of circumstances --

23

QUESTION:

Well, you certainly must -- you

24

certainly must concede that the statute could be consti­

QUESTION:

Well, if the agency here had given

your client a hearing within two days and decided the case

within two more days, I would doubt if you would have had

much objection to that, would you?

MS. CURTIN:

Justice White, if the agency had

proposed anything near that kind of timetable with my

client I wouldn't be standing here.

that we had a constitutional riqht to a post-suspension

else here, Justice Scalia, because perhaps, maybe I am

wrong, but perhaps this is the source of the confusion

between us, or the disagreement.

that had the hearing been convened, and given the total lack

When the Federal District Court judge agreed with

us that the statute was unconstitutional, the FDIC

suggested an alternative hearing schedule to him which

for and we were consistently denied it.

If you look at the

You will find a letter in there from the regional

very pointedly that we will get the minimum requirements of

the statute and no more, either in when the hearing occurs

or the nature of the hearing.

We are consistently told here that the FDIC doesn't

a habit of denying an opportunity to confront and cross

Mr. Mallen's experience and the letter from the

assertion, and on the one time when a fact was provided it

and employee of the bank.

his stock in the bank or its parent holding company.

contains a restriction on participation in the conduct of

The FDIC

That is under a different —

Well, nevertheless, he wouldn't be

automatically entitled to go back.
MR. HARRISON:

That ': s true.

I'm sorry.

The

18

suspension would be over, however, and there are two process

19

processes that can end the suspension, but the suspension

20

continues until one of them -- quite reasonably continues

21

until one of them decides that the suspension can come to

22

an end, and the suggestion that it is necessary to have a

23

hearing on all the possible issues, that every way in which

24

the suspension could be brought to an end has to be decided

25

for there to be meaningful process, is just not correct.

What Mallen is suggesting is that it is very

1

2

important for the FDIC's decision to be reconsidered rather

3

than some other way of ending the suspension to take effect,

4

and that is just not sound.

5

explaining why this case is not moot, Section 1818(g) has

6

significant consequences that Section 1829 does not.

As Ms. Curtin explained in

We agree that the Section 1829 bar attaches as

7

8

soon as a judgment of conviction is entered in the District

9

Court.

10

it does not make the Section 1818(g) suspension unimportant.

11

In particular under Section 1818(g), as Ms. Curtin explained,

12

the indicted officer can't participate in the conduct of the

13

affairs of the bank.

14

couldn't act as the controlling shareholder of the holding

IS

company that ran the bank.

16

That does not end the Section 1818(g) suspension and

In Mallen's case that meant that he

Obviously, it may be extremely important to cret

17

the dominant figure out of the bank pending the resolution

18

to criminal charges, and it is just as important to get him

19

out of his position of control from which he can direct what

20

the bank does as it is actually to stop him being an officer

21

or director.

22

So, Section 1818(g) not only has a consequence

23

that Section 1829 doesn't have that continues past

24

conviction in the District Court, but a very important

25

consequence, and one that in this case was very important

until the bank was closed.
Now, even after the bank has been closed, Section

3

1818(g) has collateral consequences, as we explain in

Footnotes 10 and 12 of our main brief and Footnote 2 of

our reply brief that keep the case alive and not moot, but

is really very important.

Not only is it not moot,

Also, the discussion that Ms. Curtin gave of the

9

need for larger and more rapid post-suspension proceedings

10

ignores the fact that the FDIC is proceeding into the

11

suspension on the basis of the indictment, and acts as if

12

when the indictment is entered that is just the trigger for

13

the FDIC to inquire into whether it would be safe for the

14

indicted officer to remain at the bank, but the premise of

15

the statute is that the indictment creates a danger and' that

16

that's the mean reason that the FDIC imposes the suspension,

17

and the suggestion that there is a lot td. be asked about

18

about what other grounds the FDIC may have had for thinking

19

that the indictment creates a threat to the interests of

20

depositors or a threat to public confidence is just not

21

persuasive, and in this case Mallen obviously knew why he

had been indicted,

FDIC's reservations about his conduct at the bank.
