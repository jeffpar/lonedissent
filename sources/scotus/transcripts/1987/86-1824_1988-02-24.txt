Ms. Solak, is it your position then that

a police chase never implicates the Fourth Amendment until

the person being chased is actually stopped or seized?

MS. SOLAK:

That is my position, and that seizure,

of course, could take place by actual physical restraint by

the officer.

You mean even if the red lights were

That is correct,even if there were

No, he did not.

Justice Kennedy's point, we do not concede that the instant

suggest is that there was absolutely no entree or attempted

16

communication by the police officer other than his mere

presence on the scene and in the absence of a show of authority

19

to assume that the defendant would in fact have been seized.

QUESTION: He says stop.

MS. SOLAR:

QUESTION:

Well, is a show of authority enouah to

MS. SOLAR: No, I do not believe'that'it is

Assuming arauendo that

the pursuit of the respondent was a seizure and that his'
abandonment was a search, the petitioner submits that the
minimal intrusion upon the individual may be justified by
circumstances which would lead a resonable person to believe
that criminal activity was afoot.

MS. STANYAR:

The latter, Your Honor.

If flight

is deemed to constitute reasonable suspicion, then every

police chase would be deemed a reasonable seizure, because

every police chase involves someone running away.

more, a rule allowing a second tier seizure, a Terry type

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

Further­

Every police chase does not

that is, someone who only starts running after he sees the

policeman.

saw them.

I agree, Your Honor.

My point is

that if flight,

a situation where if that constitutes reasonable suspicion,

20

then every chase is a reasonable seizure in terms of no other

suspicion is necessary, no other sort of suspicious gestures,

furtive actions, nothing else would be required,'and I think

that that at least would be a retreat from this Court's

suggestion in those cases that flight is not enough.

We submit simply that the chase which occurred in

QUESTION:

Ms. Stanyar, are you going to abandon

MS. STANYAR:

Your Honor, in my reading --no, I

haven't abandoned it.

It is just that it is my reading of the

MS. STANYAR:

By defining a seizure exclusively as

be decided or to the realities of the situation.

should be looking at here is whether this chase was an

it was, then it offended the basic principle under the Fourth

Amendment.

In this case --

13

Police officers could conceivably rush up or chase

up to a stationary crowd, and if an individual seeing police

there would be' no Fourth Amendment intrusion.

That is precisely where petitioner's approach

20

has taken the Sixth Circuit, and I would hope that this Court

21

would agree that that is an outrageous result, and one that

think that we are not relying on a prolonged confrontation in
