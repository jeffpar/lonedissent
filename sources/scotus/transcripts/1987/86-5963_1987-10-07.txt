ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD E. CUNNINGHAH ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

6

7

MR. CUNNINGHAM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
l

8

may it please the Court:

9

The issue in this case is whether the state's use of

10

a preclusion sanction as to relevant probative testimony of a

11

defense witness in order to enforce its discovery rules

12

violated the compulsory process clause of the Sixth Amendment.
On the second day of a four day jury trial, defense

13
14

counsel sought to amend his list of witnesses to include the

15

witness Alfred Wormley.

16

this request until the following morning.

17

court ordered that the witness testify under oath as an offer

18

of proof outside of the presence of the jury.

The trial judge reserved his ruling on
At that time, the

The witness' testimony was subjected to

19
20

cross-examination by both the prosecutor and the court.

After

21

hearing this testimony and arguments, the court found that

22

there had been a blatant and willful violation of the discovery

23

rules.

24

testifying stating, "I feel that defense attorneys have been

25

violating discovery in this courtroom in the last three or four

The court ordered that the witness be precluded from

Heritage Reporting Company

1

cases blatantly, and I am going to put a stop to it, and this

2

is one way to do so."

’ i

He further remarked that he was considering reporting

3
4

the defense attorney to the disciplinary commission, and that

5

he did not think that any attorney should violate any orders

6

purposefully to get an edge for his client.

7

It is our position that the court's exclusion.of the

8

witness was arbitrary and that it violated the Sixth Amendment.

9

Although there is a serious question as to whether the

10

preclusion sanction would ever be constitutionally permissible,

11

all parties are in agreement at the very least that before the

12

sanction may be employed that a balancing test must be used to

13

determine whether the state's interest in using preclusion

14

outweighs the defendant's right to present his defense

15

witnesses.
The balancing test that we urge this Court to adopt

16
17

is the one that has been employed by the vast majority of lower

18

courts addressing this issue.

19

presumption against exclusion of otherwise admissible defense

20

evidence.

21

the judicial system depends on a full and fair disclosure of

22

the defendant's version of the facts as well as the state's, so

23

that the jury may be decide where the truth lies.

24
25

That test begins with a

requiring you to give lists of witnesses.
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

, . >

That is correct, Your Honor.

And we

3

have to look at the intent of the discovery rules.

4

intent of the discovery rules is to prevent surprise for the

5

other party.

feel that the proper steps that a court should take is to see

7

that the other party be made whole in terms of surprise.

And when the rule has not been complied with, we

QUESTION:

9

MR. CUNNINGHAM:

10
11

Would that be a continuance?
It would depend upon the

circumstances of the case, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Certainly, the prosecution never wants a

12

continuance in a criminal case.

13

almost entirely for the benefit of the defendant.

14

The main

MR. CUNNINGHAM:

A continuance usually is

Well, I would point out in that

15

regard that in Illinois that there is a long line of cases that

16

were the state has violated the discovery rules and seeks to

17

now put what would be termed a surprise witness before the

18

court that if the defendant simply objects and asks for a

19

preclusion and the court then admits the testimony, on-appeal

20

the defendant has waived his right to appeal if he has not

21

requested a continuance.

22

that that is conclusive evidence that the defendant was not

23

prejudiced by the admission of the testimony, since the

24

defendant did not even indicate that he needed a continuance to

25

prepare for that witness' testimony.

Because the courts in Illinois hold

would be the proper remedy.

3

do not think that the state even needed a continuance here.

4

Once it heard what the witness' testimony was going to be, it

5

then had before it and knew what witnesses it needed in;Order

6

to reflect that testimony.

QUESTION:

1

2

What about getting other witnesses to

impeach that witness?

3

MR. CUNNINGHAM:

4

QUESTION:

5

That is correct, Your Honor'.

That would have required a continuance,

would it not?
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

6

Not in this case, Your Honor.

In

7

this case, the witness testified that he had observed and heard

8

the state witnesses plotting to go after Ray Taylor in this

9

case, and that he had observed the state witnesses with

10

pistols.

Those were the very witnesses present at court that

11

day testifying for the state.

12

QUESTION:

What about getting other people to come in

13

and say that this man is a congenital liar, other people who

14

knew this witness?

15

MR. CUNNINGHAM:

Well, Your Honor, certainly if the

16

prosecution believed that they had other evidence that needed

17

to be investigated, they could request a continuance.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

And the only way to get that sort of

evidence would have been a continuance.
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

Well, our argument here, Your Honor,

21

is that the burden should be on the state.

22

seeking to preclude the defendant from presenting a witness.

23

That is a constitutional right provided to the defendant.

24
25

QUESTION:

The state is

If you are in violation of the rules, and

the burden is on the state.

That seems strange.

7

Heritage

MR. CUNNINGHAM:

1

We believe that the burden is on the

2

state, Your Honor, because it is the state that is seeking to

3

preclude the witness from testifying.

4

themselves provide, exclusion is not the only remedy;

5

committee comments to the rules and notes that there might be

6

constitutional problems if the defense was precluded from

7

presenting a witness.
QUESTION:

Now as the rules

with hearsay testimony, and the judge says I am not going to
let this in because it is hearsay.

Would you make the argument, well, it is important

evidence, you have to give me a continuance so that I can go

13

and get the fellow who really said it so that it will not be

14

hearsay anymore; you would not expect to get a continuance for

15

that, would you?
You have simply violated the rules of the game by

16
17

trying to introduce hearsay evidence which is not reliable

18

enough, and the court says I am sorry, we are going to move

19

ahead.
Would you expect a continuance to be able to go and

20
21

get the original declarer?

22

MR. CUNNINGHAM:

You would not.
My answer is that the court should

23

endeavor to ensure that the defense is able to present its

24

witnesses.

25

QUESTION:

In that hearsay case, you would expect a

8

Heritage

1

continuance?

2

MR. CUNNINGHAM:

Well, it would depend.

If the

3

defense had never gotten a continuance in the past and if it

4

was only going to be a one day continuance, I think that it

5

would be an abuse of the Court's discretion and a violation of

6

the Constitution to not grant that continuance.
QUESTION:

7

Mr. Cunningham, what do you do at the

8

point where the court says you have been doing this over, and

9

over, and over again and I have got to stop it?
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

10

Well, that is exactly what the judge

11

said here, not to that counsel personally, but he said that it

12

had been happening in his courtroom over and over.
QUESTION:

QUESTION:

Would the case be different

3

constitutionally if instead of the attorney that it was the

4

defendant himself who had just not brought forth this: witness

5

until the last minute because he is afraid that he might have

6

been intimidated, or maybe he intimidated the witness and did

7

not want to identify him until right before trial?
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

different, Your Honor.

:

I think that the case may' well be

There are other factors to consider

10

too.

But it could well be that if the defendant himself was

11

the one who had brought about this delay purposefully in order

12

to inject what appeared to be perjured testimony> that if you

13

combined that with evidence in the record that the state was

14

going to be prejudiced and was not going to be able to be

15

prepared through the use of other sanctions, then perhaps the

16

preclusion sanction would be appropriate.

17

have that in this case.

QUESTION:

MR. CUNNINGHAM:

Well, we have taken that. 'And we

24

are taking as our second position that even if it is not

25

appropriate that the balancing test must be employed in which

10

Heritage

Company

1

there is a presumption against preclusion.

2

QUESTION:

But your more extreme position that it is

3

never an appropriate sanction would require us to even allow

4

the defendant to play games with the court?
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

5

1

Well, as I pointed out in Braswell

6

v. Wainwright, the Fifth Circuit suggested that perhaps if it

7

were so flagrant that could be construed as a knowing and

8

intelligent waiver by the defendant of his Sixth Amendment

9

right to present witnesses and that would be approached in this

\

10
11
12

13

Court.

: :
QUESTION:

And you are saying that this kind of

waiver could be made on behalf of the defendant by his counsel?
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

No, Your Honor.

I believe that the

14

recent Second Circuit opinion in Escalera v. Coombe and1 the

15

Ninth Circuit opinion in Fendler v. Goldsmith are correct on

16

this point, that it is fundamentally unfair to put upon a

17

defendant, an innocent defendant, his counsel's bad faith in

18

this situation.

19

this Court recognized recently in Rock v. Arkansas in citing

20

Ferata v. California, that this Court noted that the:right to

21

compulsory process is a personal right to the defendant and is

22

not a right of counsel.

23

v

Because another reason for that would be, as

The test which we propose begins with a presumption

24

against exclusion of otherwise admissible defense evidence.

25

The presumption is required because the integrity of the

11
Heritage Reporting Company
(202) 628-4888

1
2

judicial process — I am sorry, I mentioned that.
The denial of the defendant's right calls into

3

question the ultimate integrity of the fact finding process,

4

and requires that the competing interest be closely examined.

5

Maximum truth gathering rather than arbitrary limitation ought

6

to be the goal.

7

Put another way, the presumption against exclusion

8

puts the burden on the state to demonstrate a compelling

9

interest which requires the denial of the right.

10

QUESTION:

It sounds to me like the inquisitorial

11

system, not the adversarial system which we have.

12

have a system in which each side.

MR. CUNNINGHAM:

Exactly, and that is the truth

QUESTION:

That both sides ought

Subject to certain rules.

And sometimes

17

you break a rule like if you try to introduce evidence that is

18

unreliable because it is hearsay, and it is simply excluded.

19

MR. CUNNINGHAM:

20

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

And here what the court was saying is this

21

evidence is unreliable, because it has not been subjected to

22

the testing process that our requirements of advance notice

23

provide for.

24
25

Since it is unreliable, I am excluding this.

MR. CUNNINGHAM:
court's ruling.

No.

That was not the basis for the

I read the basis.

The main basis for the

12

Heritage

Reporting Company
(202) 628-4888

1

court's ruling was to act as a deterrent in other cases.

2

QUESTION:

So that the system would work in other

3

cases, that advance notice and ability to check out witnesses

4

would occur in those case.
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

5

But if that test is going to be

6

applied, if it is going to almost be a per se preclusion every

7

time the defense violates discovery such as it did in this

8

case, then we are not recognizing any longer the importance of

9

the Sixth Amendment right.
QUESTION:

10

Well, the Sixth Amendment right is such as

11

the Justice suggests to rules of evidence.

12

simply come up with any piece of evidence that he feels is

13

relevant and say, look, the Sixth Amendment guarantees me the

14

right to place this before the jury.

15

elaborate system of rules.
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

16

A defendant cannot

It is all subject to an

That is correct, Your Honor, but I

17

do not think that the rules take precedence over the right.

18

Certainly, the right is above it.

19

when anyone is seeking, as the state was seeking here, to

20

abridge that right that the burden has to be on the state to

21

show that there were no other remedies to make the State whole.

22

And here the state has totally failed to do that.

In any event, I think that

It never argued in the trial court that it was not

23
24

prepared to meet Mr. Wormley's testimony once it had heard that

25

testimony.

And our argument is that the burden is on the

13

state.

2

it has to demonstrate that there is a compelling interest on

3

the other side for the abridgement.

4

to show that it could not have met that testimony.

5

other effective remedies that would have fully met the ihtent

6

of the discovery rules here.

If it is seeking to abridge the Sixth Amendment right,

People v. Rayford, which the Solicitor General has agreed is a

However, we did cite Washington v.

Our position is that the case law of this Court makes

MR. CUNNINGHAM:

The trial lawyer said, well, you

Your Honor, our position is that it

is not the burden of the client, not the burden of the

10

defendant, I am sorry, to impose upon the court that balancing

11

test.

The court has that duty.
QUESTION:

12

In doing the balancing under youriview,

13

would the judge's doubts about the credibility of the witness

14

be a factor that he could weigh, and here the judge did express

15

such doubts?
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

16
17

He said, for what it is worth, he

expressed some doubt about a portion of the credibility.
QUESTION:

18

19

i

That part of his testimony is inherently

improbable.
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

20

No, Your Honor.

It is our position

21

that the credibility of the witnesses is for the jury to

22

determine.

23

in Rock v. Arkansas, and Chambers v. Mississippi.

This Court has made that clear time and tiitie again

24

QUESTION:

What about harmless error?

25

MR. CUNNINGHAM:

Well, Your Honor —

Heritage

Comoany

QUESTION:

1

I mean if one were to find that there may

2

be a violation of a compulsory process clause say in a

3

hypothetical case, but the witness' testimony was so tangential

4

or so minor that it could not possibly have affected the

R

outcome, certainly that sort of a review for harmless error

6

would be permissible, would it not?

7

MR. CUNNINGHAM:

I do not believe that in the trial

8

court that should be permissible, frankly.

9

certainly there is a harmless error analysis to any of these

10

But I believfe that

case, I would agree.
QUESTION:

11

• -i .
An appellate court reviewing your claim

12

could say true, there was a violation of the compulsory process

13

clause, but it was just harmless error.

14

MR. CUNNINGHAM:

There is no question about that.

15

But the standard would be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,

16

as it is in Schneble v. Florida.

17

In this case though, to get to the balancing test if

18

we can for a moment, keeping in mind that there should be a

19

presumption against preclusion in applying the test.
QUESTION:

20

23

talking about —

QUESTION:

So you are going to put the burden on the

discovery statutes, do not require preclusion, Your Honor.

The point that I am trying to make is that in this

Maybe if I could briefly discuss what the

testimony was.
The issue in this case was a credibility question of

2
3

who shot the complaining witness, Jack Bridges.

4

witnesses were Jack Bridges and his three relatives.

5

stated that Ray Taylor had shot him during a fight that Mr.

Bridges and his relatives were having with Ray Taylor.and his

friends.

They

to the event, who testified that Ray Taylor was not armed’

10

during the event, that it was Jack Bridges' brother who fired

11

shots into the crowd trying to protect Jack Bridges and who

12

shot Jack Bridges.

13

his brother, had both testified that they were unarmed on that

14

night.

15

Also I might add that Bridges and Bethany,

Mr. Wormley, the excluded witness, would have

16

testified that prior to the incident sometime earlier in the

17

evening that he joined a group of people including Jack Bridges

18

and his family on the porch of Bridges' sister.

19

observed Bridges handing a blanket containing two pistols to

Now this testimony was very crucial to the defense.

Number two, it directly rebutted the testimony of

1
2

Bridges and Bethany that they were unarmed on that night.

3

number three, it added an element to the defense's case which

4

was totally lacking, and that is the element of planned

5

aggression on the part of Bridges and his family.

6

testimony was crucial to the defense.

And

So this

Now once the state had heard all of that testimony

7
8

and the offer or proof, they were no longer surprise, and

9

surprise is the main thing that we are looking to overcome.

At

10

that point, they were no longer surprised.

11

at that point in the trial, there were still three of the state

12

witnesses to be presented, and all of the defense to be

13

presented.

Also I might add,

The trial did not end until the following day.
So at that point, the state basically knew the

14
15

witnesses that it needed to rebut Mr. Wormley's testimony.

16

They needed the complaining witness and his family who were all

17

present there.

18

needed additional witnesses, then they could inform the court

19

as to what they needed and how much time they needed.

20

perhaps the court could make a determination as to whether that

21

would be so prejudicial to the state to have to grant a

22

continuance at that time that he would consider precluding the

23

witness.

24
25

Now if from talking to them they felt that they

The interesting

thing here is that unlike Chambers, or Washington, or Rock, we

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

•.

MR. SHABAT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

'

The position of the State of Illinois in this

21

proceeding is that when a defendant as Petitioner Taylor did in

22

this case sought to compel witnesses to attend court,;he did so

23

understandably in an effort to present evidence to a jury which

24

was going to decide his guilt or his innocence.

25

In the course of doing that or in the attempt to do

26

Heritage

Reporting

(202)

628-4888

Company

1

so, it is incumbent upon defendants as well as prosecutors in

2

this country to do so with compliance with established

3

procedures, procedures which we submit assure fairness and

4

reliability in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence.

5

not merely the element of surprise that discovery rules

6

address.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Shabat, may I ask, is there any

8

evidence that the defendant was closely involved in this

9

noncompliance with the discovery rule, or was it just the

10
11

It is

lawyer who was responsible?
MR. SHABAT:

Your Honor, the record reflects that at

12

the time, at the time during trial, after the jury had been

13

selected, after opening statements by both the state and the

14

defense, and after two of the state's key witnesses had

15

testified on both direct and cross-examination that the court

16

sent the jury home until the next day.

17

defense attorney stated that he had just learned of an

18

additional witness who could have and probably did see the

19

entire incident.

20
21
22

And at that time, the

There was a suggestion implicit in that.

QUESTION:

Yes, but my question was was defendant

personally involved in the noncompliance?
MR. SHABAT:

I suggest that it can be inferred that

23

when he learned, when the defense attorney is telling the court

24

that he learned, although we do not know directly and

25

specifically and we can only infer, that he learned it from his

27
Reporting Company
(202) 628-4888

Heritage

1

client who was sitting there at counsel table.
QUESTION:

2

Then the answer to my question is that

3

there is no evidence that the defendant was personally involved

4

in this?
MR. SHABAT:

5
6

that is correct.

7
8

There is no direct evidence of that,

In the attempt to avoid surprise, we are really
talking about more than that.

Because we are talking about an

effort to assure fairness and reliability in the ascertainment
10

of guilt and innocence.

11

To the extent that the Sixth Amendment may be

12

implicated in that or notions of due process, it does not

13

permit a defendant to present testimony that is free from

14

legitimate demands.

15

specific instance are demands of an adversary system;'

16

there is really no justification for a defendant under the

17

guise of any constitutional right to attempt to assert half

18

truths.

1

QUESTION:

The discovery rules in Illinois in the
Because

I take it then that you are saying then

20

that preclusion is automatically justified in every single case

21

of noncompliance?

22

MR. SHABAT:

No, sir, that is not our position.

23

Preclusion under our discovery rules in Illinois and in most of

24

the states, and almost all of the states have such rules,

25

preclusion is an option.

It is an option among other options

28
Heritage Reporting Company
(202) 628-4888

1

which a judge in his discretion can, must use, and did in fact

2

use in this case.

QUESTION:

That may be the state rule, but is it your

4

position that the Sixth Amendment would never, never forbid

5

preclusion?

MR. SHABAT:

9

No.
Sometimes?
There are circumstances, there are

circumstances.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. SHABAT:

■

What are they, just name one?
I think that it would involve a

12

circumstance where the nature of the violation, for example,

13

being one that was fairly technical.

14

discovery had to be completed within a given jurisdiction after

15

a number of days, but in any event well before the parties

16

intended to go to trial.

17

QUESTION:

If, for example,

'• ">

Would the Sixth Amendment ever forbid

18

preclusion where there is a failure to reveal a name of a

19

witness in compliance with the rule?

20

MR. SHABAT:

It might.

It might after a

21

determination by the judge of all of the factors such as the

22

reason, the motivation behind the failure.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

So do you think that there is a balancing

process that must go on in every case?
MR. SHABAT:

Most certainly, Your Honor.

that is appropriate.

same with hearsay, because I mean the Sixth Amendment applies

I

We have

And I do not believe

I thought that you were telling us that

10

part of the purpose of this rule is if there has not been the

time to investigate the witness that the evidence is

unreliable.

I thought that was part of your case.

3

MR. SHABAT:

4

QUESTION:

5

In this case, that is right.
Well, just in this case, but not generally

under these rules?
MR. SHABAT:

6

No.

Prosecutors must have an

7

opportunity to fully investigate their case.

It is not

sufficient for a prosecutor to have to sit at trial after

having prepared his case and investigated the evidence, having

selected a jury, having selected a jury I might add with a mind

21

towards the type of witnesses that will be presented during the

22

case —

QUESTION:

Mr. Shabat, suppose in this case instead

of saying what he did to the judge, as I understand what you

told us, that what defense counsel said was I have just

made an awful boner here, it is not my client's fault; I have

known about this witness and I forgot to put it down, and that

4

is why I did not comply with the discovery rule, and I do not

5

think that my client should be penalized by denying him his

6

right under the Sixth Amendment in those circumstanced, what

7

would you do with a case like that?

8
9

MR. SHABAT:

I would have to weigh that factor, Your

Honor, with due regard to the other factors present in the case

10

such as when does this occur.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. SHABAT:

Just when it occurred here.
That is essentially what the defense

13

lawyer tried to say.

14

has just indicated that he just learned of this witness, he

15

sort of retracts that, and he says on page 206 of the record of

It seemed to me that you took a little

In the brief submitted by the State of

Illinois, we suggested that based on our historical analysis of

the evolution of the writing of the compulsory process clause

19

that perhaps Washington v. Texas should be reconsidered.

20

if it were not to be reconsidered, it is our view that only

21

arbitrary, only arbitrary rules, and procedures, or statutes

22

which interfere with the compulsory process clause ought to

follow that clause.

24

Let me change Justice Brennan's

hypothetical a little.

Suppose that the name of the witness was on the list

that counsel had prepared but that his secretary just omitted

one name out of twenty, you would come to the same conclusion,

9

I take it?
MR. SHABAT:

10

It is possible.

It would depehd again

11

on the timing of that discovery, and what inferences if any or

12

what specific conclusions could be drawn after an examination

13

of the attorney in court, whether it was designed as a

14

strategical tactical advantage, an improper one I might add, or

15

whether in fact it was merely technical.

it was a sheer secretary's oversight.

of conduct.

But in any event, that does not advance the

And once a jury is listening to evidence and they are

Mr. Shabat, I have another problem

relating to the facts in this case.

MR. SHABAT:

Your Honor, I believe to the contrary,

12

the witness that he was fully cognizant of the actions

13

available to him.

14

witness, Alfred Wormley, who was tendered and identified to the

15

state when he was, but there is evidence in this record that

16

prior to trial before the first witness was called but after

jury selection that the defense asked leave of court to amend

19

so, and they were not excluded.

What the judge did, however, in that instance was I-

21

believe a very measured and appropriate response from which I

22

derive inference that he was conducting a balancing approach.

23

He told the state that for those witnesses before they were

24

allowed to testify that time would be taken for the state to

25

attempt to interview them.

I think that this shows a measured

response which is an indication of his cognizance of why he was

2

doing what he did and what was available to him beyond that

3

which he did for any of the witnesses for whom discovery was an

4

issue in this case.

5

And I also believe that the judge was weighing in his

6

mind as evidenced by his words the problem that he was

7

confronting and that he had confronted, and that other judges

8

of the Circuit Court of Cook County had confronted in previous

9

cases, where surprise ambush defense tactics had been

perpetrated upon the state.

The obligation that was placed on the

concern, Your Honors, is that if he is successful here that he

flagrant here.

I believe that judge acted in a judicious,

the outcome of this trial, nor could it be said that the
