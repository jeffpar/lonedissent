ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE R. ROBBINS, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

11

MR. ROBBINS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court.
In the 23 years since the Food Stamp Act of 1964 was

12

enacted, Congress has many times considered and several times

13

enacted measures designed to restrict the availability of food

14

stamps to households with members who were on strike.

15

In 1981, the 97th Congress enacted an amendment to

16

the Food Stamp Act now codified at 7 U.S.C. 2015(d)(3) whose

17

Constitutionality is at issue in the case this morning.

18

amendment generally provides that households that contain

19

strikers are not eligible for food stamps by reason of the loss

20

of income occasioned by the strike.

21

households eligible for food stamps prior to the strike will

22

retain their eligibility but will not receive any additional

23

food stamps by reason of that loss of income.

24
25

QUESTION:

That

It provides moreover that

What is the purpose of that exception do

you think, Mr. Robbins?
MR. ROBBINS:

Heritage

I think, Justice Blackmun, that

Congress sought to strike what I would call a balance of

2

competing interests.

3

were placed in no worse position by virtue of the strike.

4

Congress simply sought not to permit the loss of income

5

occasioned by the strike itself to increase the eligibility for

6

food stamps.

7

of an eligibility that vested prior to the time the strike

8

began.

9

By retaining the eligibility, households

So in that sense, it doesn't deprive households

QUESTION:

Mr. Robbins, is there any evidence in the

10

legislative history that one of the purposes was to somehow

11

effect or establish national labor policy in any way?

12

just a budget device to save money, or was the exception in

13

there to further some labor policy of the government?

14

MR. ROBBINS:

Was this

I think, Justice O'Connor, Congress

15

sought to promote three objectives, and it articulated those

16

objectives in the accompanying Senate report, I believe it's

17

97-35, that accompanied the __________ legislation in 1931.

18

Those three purposes are first, as Your Honor mentioned, to

19

achieve what Congress wished to be dramatic changes in its

20

words, in the Federal spending policy.

21

reduce the overall cost of the Food Stamp program and the

22

Congressional Budget Office estimated in fact that the

23

amendment actually adopted in 2015(d)(3) would save

24

approximately $165 million in food stamp outlays over the three

25

year period 1982 to 1984.

Congress sought to

But there were two other objectives as well, apart

1

from simple saving of revenue.

2

it was tying the receipt of food stamps to the ability and

3

willingness to work.

4

balance of the food stamp scheme.

5

strikers have foregone available employment voluntarily and

6

that union strike funds should be the principal source of

7

benefits during a work stoppage.

8

9

First, Congress believed that

It thought that was consistent with the
It believed and said, that

Finally and more clearly I think directed to Your
Honor's question, Congress attempted to promote additional

10

governmental neutrality in labor disputes.

11

providing food stamps to striking workers is an incentive to

12

wait out management, in the Senate Committee's words, rather

13

than to reach compromises.

14

withdraw that incentive from labor management's disputes.

15

It believed that

And it decided that it wished to

Now, the District Court for the District of Columbia

16

recognized that these were rational goals and that the

17

legislation enacted in 2015(d)(3) is, to use the District

18

Court's words, "rationally related to legitimate legislative

19

objectives" but it struck the statute down anyway.

20

rather loose amalgam of rational based and heightened scrutiny,

21

the Court found that the statute irrationally discriminated

22

against strikers, unlawfully impinges on their free association

23

rights as well as the rights of their families and their unions

24

to free association and exacts an excessive price for the

25

protected right to strike.

Applying a

We believe each of these conclusions to be mistaken

Heritage

5
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1
2

and we ask this Court this morning to reverse.
Let me turn first, if I might, to the equal

3

protection claim in the case.

4

2015(d)(3) as social welfare legislation survives equal

5

protection scrutiny if it is rationally related to a legitimate

6

legislative purpose.

7

say at the outset that we proceed in this argument on the

8

assumption that Congress articulated its real purposes for the

9

statute when it enacted it.

It is common ground that Section

We have no doubt that it is.

But let me

10

I mention that seemingly uncontroversial point

11

because the amicus party in this case has suggested that

12

Congress' articulated purposes are in fact a camouflage for the

13

anti-labor and anti-union animus that ostensibly in reality

14

motivated the enactment.

15

resting as it does on remarks made in years past by opponents

16

about precursors of the current legislation.

17

But that claim is manifestly false,

We prefer to take Congress at its word, and I turn

18

directly therefore to the reasons that Congress actually

19

articulated as rational bases for the distinction that it drew

20

in the statute.

21

Let me start with the cost savings goal.

In 1981,

22

Congress confronted an economy that it believed to be in

23

considerable financial distress.

24

across the board cuts in a great many Federal programs.

25

Several of those were made in the Food Stamp Program, and

It therefore resolved to make

Section 2015(d)(3) reflects one of them.

Now, appellees do not

6

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

dispute that the Government may legitimately pursue cost

2

savings, but they argue that savings alone cannot justify

3

irrational distinctions.

And we agree.

4

Distinctions that are otherwise irrational are not

5

made rational simply because they save the Government money.

6

But the need to conserve funds makes distinctions inevitable.

7

And when distinctions must inevitably be made, it is equally

8

inevitable that some persons, often with a great deal in

9

common, will fall within and without the favored circle.

10

Here, Congress drew a dividing line rationally

11

grounded in the determination that strikers at least have a job

12

to go back to and have union strike funds to rely on.

13

critical respects, Congress reasonably concluded that strikers

14

may more easily than other persons absorb the necessary

15

reduction in available benefits.

16

drew a rational line in its effort to conserve funds, this

17

Court's decision last term in Bowen against Gilliard instructs

18

that the Statute that it enacted --

21

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

In those

Once it is seen that Congress

Did I hear you to say that a

man without a job is better off than a man with a job?
MR. ROBBINS:

I think what I certainly intended to

22

say, Justice Marshall, is that Congress could rationally have

23

decided that a person with a job to go back to when he chooses

24

to is better off than someone who has no job prospects at all.

25

And that we think is one of the determinations that Congress
made in enacting this Statute.
7

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

And we regard it as a reasonable and rational one for

1
2

Congress to have made.

3

QUESTION:

What about the voluntary quitter?

4

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, Justice White, the voluntary

5

quitter is treated differently under the Statute in certain

6

respects but Congress could rationally have decided that that

7

distinction was warranted.
QUESTION:

8
9

He's off the food stamps what, for ninety

days?

10

MR. ROBBINS:

11

QUESTION:

12
13

That's correct.

And the striker is off for as long as he's

on strike?
MR. ROBBINS:

That is correct, Justice White.

14

there are we think several reasons why that distinction

15

survives equal protection scrutiny.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

And

And isn't it also true of just the

deadbeat who doesn't want to work at all?
MR. ROBBINS:

No, that is not equally true.

There

19

are work registration requirements that must be satisfied.

20

law provides equally that someone must take available work at

21

the applicable minimum wage, and the failure to do so

22

disqualifies both that deadbeat and his household.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

The

How about the voluntary quitter, does he

have to take a job, another job to stay on food stamps?
MR. ROBBINS:

Well, yes he does.

He is disqualified

for ninety days and when that ninety-day disqualification has
8

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

lapsed, he too must register for work and take it if it's

2

available. And that really tells us, I think, precisely why

3

this distinction that's been drawn and that very much persuaded

4

the District Court really misdirects the eye.
QUESTION:

5

What about the quitter for cause?

Someone

6

leaves a job because there are some unacceptable demands made

7

upon him.

MR. ROBBINS:

8
9

Is he treated the same as a voluntary quitter?
No, he's not, Justice Scalia.

There is

a distinction drawn in the Statute that permits a voluntary

10

quitter to leave for cause and not absorb the ninety-day period

11

of ineligibility.

12

QUESTION:

Well, the strikers think they have cause.

13

MR. ROBBINS:

They do, and they also have a job to go

14

back to and that we think makes all the difference in the

15

world.

16

QUESTION:

Well, so does the quitter for cause, or he

17

had a job that he could have gone back.

18

there is his choice.

19

MR. ROBBINS:

The fact that it isn't

That's true, but he severed the

20

relationship.

In both cases, they have made a choice, it's

21

true, and in both cases the choice may equally derive from a

22

believe that they have good cause.

23

could rationally decide that the two persons, one who quit for

24

cause and one who struck for cause are not similarly situated

25

in one critical respect.

But we think that Congress

One of them has severed that employment relationship

and that job is gone.

decided that his cause was either not the right cause or not a

3

compelling enough cause.

4

job waiting for him to return to.

5

He can't waltz back in when he's

He's left his job.

There is not a

And there's yet another distinction.

Congress

6

obviously was trying to serve several ends at once, and one of

7

the ends that it articulated in the Committee Report was the

8

goal of labor neutrality.

9

rationally decide that extending food stamps to persons who

We thin that Congress could

10

have quit does not implicate the government in the support of

11

one side of an on-going labor dispute.

12

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Robbins, I gather that when the

13

household is disqualified, also the children in the household

14

are disqualified, are they not?

15

MR. ROBBINS:

16
17
18

When the household is ineligible, all

members of that household by definition are ineligible.
QUESTION:

Yes.

Now, how in Heaven's name does that

serve the objective of neutrality?

19

MR. ROBBINS:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. ROBBINS:

Of neutrality?

To disqualify the children?
I think the answer to that, Justice

22

Brennan, is that the Food Stamp Statute, like many other

23

Federal statutes, is predicated on a household categorization,

24

a household categorization that this Court recognized and

25

accepted two terms ago in Lynq against Castillo.

It is not the

intent of the Statute in particular to visit special burdens on
10

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

the children uniquely, as for example, this Court considered in

2

the Plyler against Doe case.

3

household income and because the Statute, like many other

4

statutes, like the Statute in Dandridqe against Williams, like

5

the Statute in Bowen against Gilliard, because those statutes,

6

like many social welfare statutes operate and attach

7

consequences -QUESTION:

8
9

Rather, it makes a judgment about

That doesn't tell me how that serves the

objective of neutrality.

10

MR. ROBBINS:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. ROBBINS:

I think, Justice Brennan â

Under this Statute.
I think the answer is that Congress

13

believed that by funding by replacing the household income

14

given up by a striker which Congress thought to be given up

15

voluntarily, it was withdrawing a subsidy that it thought

16

impaired the free flow of labor negotiations.

17

necessity, when you refuse to replace income to a household, it

18

has harsh implications in particular cases.

Now, by

19

Even, we suggest, were you to look at this only as

20

income not replaced to the individual striker, that wouldn't

21

change the fact that it has implications for his entire

22

household.

23

operates on a household basis.

24

individuals have consequences for their families.

25

The fact is that this statute, like many others,
And consequences visited to

That is a decision that Congress looked square in the
eye and decided was outweighed by the goals it sought to

Reporting

Corporation

promote.

2

QUESTION:

Couldn't Congress have looked it square in

3

the eye and made a proviso that this shall not apply to

4

children?

5
6

MR. ROBBINS:

They certainly considered explicitly.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. ROBBINS:

9

They could have, Justice Marshall.

Well, they should have.
Justice Marshall, I am unwilling as a

policy matter to second guess a judgment that its quite clear

10

Congress had before it.

11

consequences and indeed --

12
13

QUESTION:

There was testimony about the

Congress decided to deprive children of

milk?

14

MR. ROBBINS:

I don't think that's what Congress

15

meant to do at all.

16

it was doing and it did so in the face of a sure recognition

17

that there were adverse consequences for the families of

18

strikers.

I think Congress meant to do what it said

19

QUESTION:

Including children without milk.

20

MR. ROBBINS:

21

Congress has debated proposals like this for twenty

Including children without milk.

22

years, and for a great many years the opponents of this

23

legislation held sway, articulating precisely these kinds of

24

consequences.

3

So what you're saying is that it was a

It was never passed by both Houses over

13

climate changed, or Congress recognized that the economic

14

crises that it perceived in 1981 had grown too great, that the

15

peril that it thought it was addressing by a broad-based

16

package of legislation now merited some important changes in

17

many programs.

18
19
20

And whether it's the fact that the political

All of those factors may have entered into it.

QUESTION:

The practical consequence for the children

is that the father has to leave home, isn't it?
MR. ROBBINS:

No.

I think that's no more true in

21

this case, Justice Blackmun, than it was in Castillo and in

22

Gilliard or certainly in Castillo when precisely the same

23

argument was made and rejected by this Court.

24
25

I think the same logic suggests that the impact for
purposes of dissociating families is no greater here than in
those cases.

Heritage

13

QUESTION:

1

Of course, the pro rata possibility could

2

have been considered and was considered in other elements of

3

the statute, wasn't it?

4

MR. ROBBINS:

5

QUESTION:

The possibility of?

Of just reducing the food stamp allocation

6

for the striker individually and preserving the food stamps for

7

the children.

8

of the Statute?

9

This kind of thing is present in other aspects

MR. ROBBINS:

That's correct.

There are certain

10

parts of the statute that attach a consequence only for the

11

person who has taken certain action.

12

provision has that aspect.

13

Blackmun that many many other parts of the Statute attach

14

consequences for the whole household.

15

the refusal to take a job at the minimum wage, the refusal to

16

provide certain kinds of reported information on an annual

17

basis, all of those things attach consequences on a household

18

basis.

19

For example, the fraud

Although I might add, Justice

The refusal o register,

And this is consistent with all of those.
Yes, it's true to answer your question that Congress

20

could have cut the line more finely, but it is only

21

Constitutionally required to do so when there is a basis for

22

heightened scrutiny for either the inference of a suspect

23

classification or the inference of a fundamental right.

24
25

There is neither in this case and this Court's
decisions make quite clear that in the absence of a
constitutional warrant for heightened scrutiny, there is
14

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1

accordingly no reason to require the Congress to divide its

2

distinctions more finely.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Robbins, I think you argued earlier

4

that one of the concerns is that the government would be

5

subsidizing strikers, wasn't it, if they were not disqualified

6

for food stamps.

7
8

MR. ROBBINS:

The concern was for additional

governmental neutrality.

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

Well just how much money was

10

involved?

Didn't that 1975 study by GAO show that 89 to 96

11

percent of all strikers -- this is before the '81 Amendment â

12

did not participate in the food stamp program, and further the

13

cost of what there was in '75 was only .2 to .3 percent of all

14

non-public assistance food stamp households.

15

Isn't that right?

16

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, I think, Justice Brennan, when

17

the statute was finally passed, the empirical evidence was a

18

little b it more equivocal than it was before the Congress when

19

it

refused to pass the statute many years earlier.
QUESTION:

20

Well, it's not so many years.

Those

21

figures I thought were 1975, isn't that right, and the statute

22

was 1981?

23

MR. ROBBINS:

That's correct, Justice Brennan.

The

24

fact is, however, that by 1981, the Congressional Budget Office

25

was estimating that this particular amendment would engender
savings on the order of $165 million over a three-year period.

Heritage

General Accounting Office.

that it varied over the lot.

is a classically political judgment.

9

whether the empirical evidence is persuasive enough is

That

The decision about

10

precisely the kind that this Court has consistently said is

11

consigned to the political process, and justly so.
QUESTION:

12

Congress might also have thought that

13

putting a pinky on the scale is no better than putting a thumb

14

on the scale.
MR. ROBBINS:

15

That's correct.

The view about

16

neutrality is of course that involvement of the Government at

17

all is unwarranted and it wished to withdraw that support,

18

which may not turn precisely on how powerful that support is.
QUESTION:

19

Mr. Robbins, you assert that the striker

20

is in a different situation from others because he can go back

21

to work.

22

The respondent's brief contests that, at least in

23

some situations, or the appellees' brief, I should say.

24

says that, "in many instances, a struck employer will not

25

operate during a strike."
Now, what happens in that situation?
16

Heritage

Reporting Corporation

It

MR. ROBBINS:

It depends on how it is and why it is

2

that the struck employer does not operate.

3

or if it's the permanent replacement of a striker, that does

4

not trigger the provisions of the statute.

5

6

receive benefits under the Statute.

And the reason is that the First Amendment free

by an on-going process of adjusting the competing claims of

I think, Justice Brennan, that the

Moreno case which after all was also a rational based case,

claim, is different in that this Court was able to find in the

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. MCHUGH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

were numerous instances in the record where people had been

5

officials.

6

It's not in regulatory form, and I don't think that

12

the Government can really rely on it here to save the

13

constitutionality of this statute.

14

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. McHugh, do you think the

15

Constitution prohibits Congress from disqualifying for food

16

stamps, families of voluntary quitters?

17
18
19

MR. MCHUGH:

I think that that's a very important

consideration in this case.
QUESTION:

As was pointed out â

Well, does it, or not?

Does the

20

Constitution forbid Congress from disqualifying families for

21

food stamps of voluntary quitters?

22

MR. MCHUGH:

I think that the Constitution prohibits

23

Congress from doing that when similarly situated families of

24

voluntary quitters or refusers of work are not treated as

25

punitively as the families of strikers.

For example, voluntary

quitters have the opportunity to show good cause and there are
26

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

many situations when people on strike go on strike for

2

identical circumstances as would be good cause for voluntarily

3

quitting, and their families would have no penalty imposed, but

4

since the member of their household is on strike, they're taken

5

off the stamps completely for the duration of the strike.
So I think it's the similarly situated comparison

6
7

that makes it unconstitutional, not just taking the families

8

off per se under the equal protection theory.

9

QUESTION:

I guess I just don't understand your

10

answer.

11

said if you voluntarily quit work, you and your family are not

12

eligible for food stamps.

Suppose all we had in front of us was a provision that

13

MR. MCHUGH:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

Is that unconstitutional?

I don't think so.
Well, then why can't strikers be treated

the same?
MR. MCHUGH:

Because voluntary quitters are not

17

treated that way.

18

disqualification at the worst, and then they are eligible even

19

though they turn their back on income just like the strikers

20

did, and even though they walked away from income and made

21

themselves eligible for food stamps.

22

Voluntary quitters have a ninety-day

And I think that this Court has made clear, in

23

Castillo, for example, that similarly situated individuals have

24

to be treated similarly to satisfy the rationality requirement

23

MR. MCHUGH:

people attacking a law on equal protection grounds have a heavy

burden to carry.

it's not the same case as Gilliard or Castillo, which this

of the food stamp program which requires that you be available

the Government saying we're going to take that additional step

and provide that economic incentive for someone to have to

odd, anyway, to argue that in this context you can't indirectly

MR. MCHUGH:

For example, there are laws under

I think that where the governments cases

Well, in those areas, the Court was

21

concerned about employers' property rights and the public

22

interest involved in regulating strikers.

23

those interests forward in this case, and I guess I would

disagree that you can read the legislative history of this

Heritage

I think what they said was in the context of a social

1

2

welfare program, we think this advances neutrality by

3

withdrawing the support from strikers and their families, but I

4

don't think that they said, we're doing this as part of an

5

addition to the Taft-Hartley Act to regulate striking or any of

6

the other Federal legislation that this Court has upheld.
So it seems like the First Amendment basically limits

7
8

government, and when government acts viz a viz the individual

9

in a social welfare program and triggers that action based upon

10

the associational nature, it seems like to me you've got a

11

completely different type of situation.
QUESTION:

12
13

Well, it depends on whether we view it as

a social welfare program or as a form of labor policy.
MR. MCHUGH:

14

Well certainly the explicit objects of

15

the legislation are to promote the agricultural economy and to

16

alleviate hunger by providing assistance to families whose need

17

is so low that they can't afford to purchase an adequate diet,

18

and it doesn't say that they're also accomplishing labor-

19

relations type activity.
QUESTION:

20

Mr. McHugh, we haven't examined the

21

provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, and

22

specifically the provisions that render unlawful or impose

23

certain adverse consequences for particular types of strikes,

24

we haven't reviewed those under a strict scrutiny standard,

have we?

7

QUESTION:

Oh.

You think that the Taft-Hartley Act,

8

in all of its provisions relating to strikes would have to be

9

scrutinized strictly?
Because you have the same factors here if you're

10
11

relying on the insular nature of the labor union movement and

12

traditionally subjected to disfavorable treatment, as you say,

13

we have -MR. MCHUGH:

14

Well, the District Court, I think at

15

that point was really trying to make the case more like Moreno

16

and less like Castillo, and it seems like to me what the

17

District Court was doing there was looking at the part of

18

Moreno where the Court said that the bare desire to harm a

19

politically unpopular group was not a legitimate government

20

activity.

21

Now, we're not arguing that the disqualification of

strikers would not be a legitimate government purpose.

we're arguing is that the way they've accomplished it is

irrational when you compare it to the treatment of strikers.

held the Statute unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

14

Yes, I realize that.

perhaps you weren't making exactly the same arguments that

MR. MCHUGH:

I'll accept your invitation, Chief

Justice Rehnquist.
This Court has held in a long line of cases that

11

while the Government is free to deny a benefit or privilege for

12

any reason, there are some reasons that it can't deny a benefit

13

or privilege.

14

limitations on the right of the Government to impose conditions

15

on the receipt of a benefit which would burden the exercise of

16

First Amendment rights.

And these would include the First Amendment

17

I think that if you look at the comparison of the

18

treatment of voluntary quitters who quit for good cause for

19

reasons of in opposition if they leave because of

discrimination, because of unsafe working conditions or for

MR. MCHUGH:

1

Well, I think the case that best shows

2

the associational nature that this Court has looked at is

3

Citizens Against Rent Control v. City of Berkeley.

4

that case, this Court examined an ordinance which limited

5

individual contributions to committees to oppose ballot

6

provisions of $250.

7

much money as he wanted as an individual to the cause.

However, an individual could contribute as

And the Court said well, since you're limiting only

11

12

13

employment.

14

people.

What is triggering the disqualification is not the

It is turning your back on employment with other

QUESTION:

15

Now, it seems to me the same analogy

But in Citizens for Rent on the

16

contributions, we had held in Buckley v. Moreno, as some people

17

have said, that money is speech, and therefore there was

18

probably an independent First Amendment ground in Citizens

19

Against Rent Control to analyze the thing in First Amendment

20

terms since it was regulating something that was the form of

21

speech.

22

Now, do you think that those same grounds are here?

23

MR. MCHUGH:

I think that there are other areas where

24

you've looked at associational rights where it's not as clear.

25

For example, in Speiser v. Randall, which I guess to some
extent was a due process case, but has later come in, it seems

Heritage

39
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

to me, to the First Amendment, that was the denial of a tax

2

exemption â and I don't think you particularly have a First

3

Amendment right to get a tax exemption -- you just have a First

4

Amendment right not to have the tax exemption conditioned on

5

the foregoing of the exercise of First Amendment rights.

6

And I think that's where the Government misstates

7

what the state of the law is.

8

since there's no direct prohibition on striking or on

9

associational rights, it only regulates striking.

In terms of they are saying that

Then the

10

indirect effects, if you can call them indirect in the sense

11

that they aren't on the face of the Statute, can be ignored.

12

And I don't think that the District Court felt that that was

13

true, because he recognized it even though it was burdening

14

more than just the right to strike.

15

associational -- the right to express your disagreement with

16

your employer by leaving in association with others.

17

QUESTION:

It was burdening this

Mr. McHugh, I still don't understand

18

whether you're urging just ordinary scrutiny or strict scrutiny

19

when you begin talking First Amendment and associational

20

rights, that doesn't mean anything different to me than just

21

talking equal protection, unless what you're implying by that

22

is that we have to examine with strict scrutiny whether the

23

justification for this particular provision is valid.

24

You can burden associational rights, the Government

25

can, if the reason is significant enough, but we will subject
that reason to strict scrutiny.

And that's what you want us to

40

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1
2

do, isn't it?
MR. MCHUGH:

I think I would like this Court to say

3

that there's an associational element here and that the

4

Government would have to show a substantial justification.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. MCHUGH:

7

QUESTION:

Strict scrutiny.
And they haven't even tried to do so.
So you are urging strict scrutiny, which

8

brings us back to my prior question.

9

scrutiny to the National Labor Relations Act?

10

MR. MCHUGH:

Why don't we apply strict

Well, one reason would be there you are

11

not discriminating among certain kinds of associates, you're

12

not saying that we are disapproving of a type of associational

13

activity, you're only setting up a framework that's basically

14

neutral or helping at least in adjusting the relationships

15

between employers and employees.

16

But in this situation, you are dealing with a

17

situation where it's the government viz a viz individuals and I

18

think that that is perhaps one difference in the sense that the

19

First Amendment primarily goes to limit governments and doesn't

20

apply to the same extent when you're talking about the

21

adjustment of relations between private parties.

22

you have other interests such as property interest, antitrust

23

and other things that the Court has pointed to in the Lincoln

24

Federal Labor case and other cases that the Government cites

25

for this pervasive regulation of striking.

Because then

So it seems like to me that's what makes this case
41

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

2

different.
You have definitely indicated in your cases that

3

where the Government does something directly in terms of acting

4

on people in the associational context that that is different

5

from where it's doing it by just letting it happen between

6

private parties.

7

Alabama, the Court said that it's one thing for the State to

8

regulate the give and take of industrial combatants; it's

9

another thing for the government to come in and limit the

10

rights of speech in the area of industrial controversies.

11
12
13

For example, you've said in Thornhill v.

And it seems like to me that that's the same
distinction I'm trying to make here.
QUESTION:

Does that suggest that all labor relations

14

type laws of the first category have to be put in the same

15

statute, and that Congress can't in another statute perhaps, a

16

bill sent in by another department, they couldn't have a

17

regulation of labor relations?

18

MR. MCHUGH:

No.

I just think this is not a labor

19

relations statute and that was not really the purpose that

20

Congress had.

21

or at least the proponents of this amendment were -- that

22

people might be able to be at a better advantage and not have

23

to settle labor disputes more to the liking of employers.

24

I don't think that that makes it a labor relations regulation

25

just because it impinges on strikes.

What they apparently were concerned about was â

But

Healy v. James is another case I think in the First
42

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

Amendment area is similar in terms of going to this indirect

2

direct distinction that I'm discussing.

3

at the non-recognition by a State university of a student

4

organization and said that the fact that they couldn't use the

5

meeting rooms or the bulletin boards at the University was

6

enough of an impermissible burden on the right of association

7

to be a serious constitutional problem.
In effect, what happened in Healy v. James was

8
9

There the Court looked

similar to the Government's subsidy argument, the University

10

basically just declined to make available to the student

11

organization, the same facilities that it normally made

12

available to other student organizations.
I want to touch before my time is up on the subsidy

13
14

funding argument.

15

that make this case different from the medicaid abortion cases

16

which the Government attempts to rely on.

17

you look at the comparison between voluntary quitters who quit

18

for good cause and strikers who quit for identical reasons,

19

there is no plausible explanation for that distinction other

20

than the Government's disagreement with the viewpoint that's

21

being expressed by the people who quit in concert with other

22

people.

23

has not permitted even in the subsidy area.

24
25

It seems to me that there are two things

First of all, when

And this is a First Amendment element that the Court

Secondly, in the abortion cases, the Court said that
while government is under no obligation to remove obstacles not
of its own making when people want to exercise protected
43

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

rights, in this case the obstacle was poverty.

The Court still

2

recognized in those cases that the government could not turn

3

around and put an obstacle in the place of somebody because

4

they exercised a protected right.

5

that's a fundamental distinction that this Court recognized

6

both in Mahere and in Harris v. McRae.

And it seems like to me that

7

Clearly this is the situation here where the striker

8

provision is triggered by the exercise of associational rights

9

and is an obstacle placed in the path of strikers based upon

10
11

their exercise of associational rights.
QUESTION:

I don't understand your second

12

distinction.

13

disqualification is triggered by the fact that you're getting

14

an abortion?

15

Why is it different from the abortion

MR. MCHUGH:

Well, the Court in the Harris case made

16

the distinction basically saying that you have a range of

17

medical services that are potentially available and the

18

government simply withdraws funding from one of those but

19

doesn't disgualify the woman from medicaid generally, that's

20

different from the situation in Sherbert v. Verner where the

21

person lost all their benefits.

22

distinction in footnote 19 of the Harris opinion.

The Court made that

23

And similarly here this really isn't a decision to â

like that, then that would be like Harris against McRae?
MR. MCHUGH:

Yes.

I think if there was a range of

services and one was being withdrawn it perhaps would fit more

under Harris v. McRae.

But this isn't really a situation â
