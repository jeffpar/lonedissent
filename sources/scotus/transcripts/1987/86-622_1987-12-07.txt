ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

MR. TEEL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.
These cases today raise two issues for your

10

consideration.

11

suggests in its brief, the medical question of whether

12

alcoholism is a disease.

13

Congress, which has determined that alcoholism is a handicap

14

and that it is an illness, a finding that is conclusively

15

supported by the American Medical Association, the American

16

Psychiatric Association, and the National Council on

17

Alcoholism, all of whom have filed briefs in support of

18

petitioners in this case.

19

The primary issue is not, as the Government

That issue has been decided by the

Instead, the question here is whether the Veterans'

20

Administration can ignore Congress' determination and enforce a

21

regulation that defines alcoholism to be willful misconduct,

22

which regulation is applied to bar alcoholic veterans from

23

obtaining extensions of the time in which to use their VA

educational benefits.

11

Petitioners argue that Section 211(a) should be read

12

slightly more narrowly and that at a minimum review of VA

13

regulations to determine whether they comply with non-VA

14

statutes is permitted.

15

QUESTION:

Is that because of the text, Mr. Teel,

16

that you say that review of Regs to see if they comply with

17

non-VA statutes?

18

MR. TEEL:

It is because of the text and because of

19

the legislative history and the statutory scheme for review

20

that we believe Congress created here, which I will explain in

21

just a moment.

22

The petitioners here are both honorably discharged

23

veterans.

each of them began drinking while they were children; Mr.

25

Traynor at age 8, Mr. McKelvey at age 13.

They each have a family history of alcoholism, and

Before 1977, veterans were required to use their

3

educational benefits within a period of ten years following

4

their separation from the Service.

5

Benefits statute was amended by the Congress to allow

6

extensions of the limiting date, the ten-year period, to

7

veterans who had been unable to use those benefits within the

8

ten year period because of a disability that was not the result

9

of their own willful misconduct.

In this

case, the Veterans Administration refused to decide the issue

here; whether this regulation violated the Rehabilitation Act.

2

Even though it would not decide the question, it contends that

3

the Courts cannot decide the question either.

4

same time it is making these arguments to the Courts, it has

5

repeatedly during this decade told the Congress in response to

6

questions, and in testimony, that review of VA regulations is

7

in fact permitted under Section 211(a).

8

Finally, at the

As with any case involving the question of bars to

9

judicial review, we begin here with a strong presumption that

10

there is judicial review which can be overcome by a clear and

11

convincing showing that Congress did not intend such review.

12

In Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, in 1984, this Court

13

enunciated a number of factors that should be considered in

14

deciding whether review is precluded.

15

The first of these is the language of the Statute;

16

others are the structure of the statutory scheme and the

17

legislative history.

18

Let me address those three elements.

First, with respect to the language of Section

19

211(a), is not as sweeping as the Government suggests.

20

specific language at issue here is whether decisions of the

21

Administrator on any question of law or fact, under any law

22

administered by the VA providing benefits to veterans is barred

23

from review.

24
25

The

Now, certainly the Congress could have drafted a
statute far more clearly had they intended to entirely preclude
review of everything affecting the VA.

They simply could have

not what we have here.

specific clauses that must be interpreted.

4

requirement in the Statute that a decision be on a question of

5

law or fact arising under any statute administered by the
Â«
Veterans' Administration.

7

That's

We have a statute here with a number of
First, there's a

Judge Kearse noted in her dissent in Traynor in the

8

Second Circuit that not only was the Rehabilitation Act not

9

administered by the VA, there's a distinction there between

10

administering and complying with a statute.

11

Federal agencies comply with Federal statutes of broad Scope

12

that affect it.

Presumably all

Administering a statute, we believe, indicates some

Department.

17

Bowen v. American Hospital Association that a number of

18

agencies have issued regulations under Section 504 and that

19

those agencies do not have any particular expertise so there is

20

no reason to give deference to those agencies' views with

21

respect to Section 504.

22

Here, the President, by Executive Order, has

This Court recognized in its decision in 1986 in

The reason we believe that is relevant is that is

23

some indication that those agencies do not administer the

24

statute; they merely comply with a statute.

25

Secondly, there is a requirement that the Statute
provide benefits to veterans.

Heritage

a limitation on the power of Federal agencies to discriminate

3

against handicapped persons on the basis of their handicap.

4

What we have with the Rehabilitation Act is

Now, the structure and the legislative history are

5

essential to understanding the scope of Section 211(a).

It is

6

our position that the Congress crafted a rational scheme for

7

review of VA actions.

8

the Board of Veterans' Appeals.

9

Veterans Statutes establishes the jurisdiction of the Board of

Certain actions are subject to review in
Section 4004(a) of the

13

those regulations.

14

It makes clear in Section 4004(c) that the

That, as petitioners discovered here in their

15

administrative hearings in this case, is a restriction taken

16

quite seriously by the Board of Veterans' Appeals.

18

powerless to review regulations of the Veterans'

19

20

The Board

It was bound by those regulations.

With this view, this Court basically is left with two

21

alternatives; one is to make a decision that nevertheless

22

despite the view of the Board of Veterans' Appeals, there is no

23

review available here.

24

Veterans' Administration could pick and choose among those

It could

It could

1

decide not to bother with the Civil Rights Act.

2

under the Government's interpretation of Section 211(a), the

3

Veterans' Administration could do so with impunity.

4

And presumably

We believe that that is not supported by the language

5

of the Statute, and that the more rational interpretation of

6

Section 211(a) is that while decisions of the Veterans'

7

Administration within the specific facts of a veteran's case

8

under Veterans' laws as to whether a particular veteran is

9

entitled to benefits is consigned to the Board of Veterans'

10

Appeals, but that challenges to regulations under non-Veterans'

11

Administration statutes may be reviewed in the Federal Courts.

12

13
14

QUESTION:

How about challenges to regulations under

VA Statutes?
MR. TEEL:

Our position is that regulations generally

15

are reviewable because of the distinction between decisions and

16

regulations that we believe is in Section 4004.

17

that we believe this is not that case.

18

QUESTION:

I would note

The Government says there are just

19

thousands and thousands of regulations if you say any decision

20

based on a regulation is reviewable that there are just going

21

to be all sorts of cases coming into the courts.

MR. TEEL:

Do you have reason to doubt it if we were

to say that VA statute regulations as well as non-VA statute
regulations were reviewable?

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

MR. TEEL:

1

I think there is quite a lot of reason to

2

doubt it.

Within the last decade, four Federal Courts have

3

allowed review of regulations, challenges to regulations that

4

they were in excess of statutory authority, that kind of

5

challenge.

6

which you would expect if the Government's position were

7

correct here.
QUESTION:

8

9

There simply has not been that flood of litigation

And these were allowing review of

regulations based on VA statutes?

10

MR. TEEL:

Yes.

11

The other point to note here is that we believe our

12

interpretation here is supported by the Veterans'

13

Administration.

16

permitted.

21

decisions, degrees of disability, that kind of thing.

24

this issue by the Congress and has stated that in their view,

QUESTION:

3

MR. TEEL:

Pardon me?

4

QUESTION:

Or in any orthodox sense.

5

MR. TEEL:

That's correct.

But this Court has noted

6

repeatedly, and we cite cases to support this view that the

view of an agency with respect to statutes that govern it is

8

entitled to some deference.

That's the reason we think that

Congress are significant.
QUESTION:

Yes, but this statutory provision really

12

doesn't have much to do with what the Agency does; it describes

13

what courts may do.

14

MR. TEEL:

Nevertheless, I think that the Agency

17

They presumably know what

Here their view seems to be â other than in this

case â that they think 211(a) does not reach regulations.

19

21

think that it's an indication that the Veterans' Administration

recognizes that the statutory scheme for review that I

suggested was created by 211(a) is in fact the proper one.

Our argument is a

We contend that because alcoholism has been

Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act applies to the VA

impermissibly discriminatory and cannot stand.
QUESTION:

5
6

I guess under your view, disability

payments would have to be made as well, wouldn't they?

7

MR. TEEL:

Well, it is a troubling aspect of this

8

case, as the Government points out, that the VA uses the same

9

term, willful misconduct, in its disability statutes as it does

10

in these educational benefits statutes.

11

we believe that the choice for the Court is to write these

12

petitioners out of the Rehabilitation Act by saying that you

13

don't get your benefits, or to worry about the question of

14

disability benefits which, if that resulted in a problem, the

15

Congress could correct that problem.

Well, it would be pretty hard to

distinguish legally, wouldn't it, if you're right?
MR. TEEL:

Well, under the current statutes, it is.

20

But I note, for instance, under the Rehabilitation Act under

21

the definitions of what's a handicapped person with respect to

22

employment benefits, the Congress has made just that kind of

23

distinction that persons who are currently alcoholics or

24

currently are drug abusers are not covered with respect to

25

employment opportunities if their problems would prevent them
from being able to do their job.

QUESTION:

15

MR. TEEL:

Yes.

16

Now, I want to address a point that the Court of

Appeals in McKelvey made because they had some problem with the

18

notion that this was exclusion on the basis of handicap.

19

it in the context of tolling the ten-year prohibition, but

8

doesn't your argument also apply equally to a claim by a

9

veteran for disability benefits based on his alcoholism?

10

MR. TEEL:

I think it well might, yes, sir.

11

QUESTION:

So you don't really buy Judge Ginsburg's

12

distinction of the two.

13

will decide the issue on disability benefits?

14

MR. TEEL:

You say then whatever we decide today

Well, I think, as Justice O'Connor notes,

15

it's a tough distinction to make.

There are suggestions that

16

the VA might be able, for instance, to determine that if

17

somebody knows they have the problem of alcoholism and they're

18

not receiving treatment, that perhaps that alone is a

19

sufficient basis to call willful misconduct in the disability

20

You're going to explain how the Rehab Act

is administered by the Veterans' Administration?
MR. GANZFRIED:

5

I'm going to explain how what's being

6

challenged in this case is a decision by the Administrator

7

under a law administered by the VA, namely the decision was to

8

deny the particular extension on the educational benefits

9

program to the petitioners.

I would also point out that to the

10

extent that the petitioners are suggesting that the

11

Rehabilitation Act has required some modification of the

12

Veterans' Benefits law, they're arguing that the Rehabilitation

13

Act has been integrated into that Statute, and of course, it's

14

the head of the Agency who has been given the responsibility by

15

Congress of implementing the Rehabilitation Act within his

16

Agency's programs.

17

There's a reference to the Department of Justice.

18

The Department of Justice has coordinating responsibilities,

19

but to the extent that the Administrator has to make a decision

20

in a benefits case, that subsumes questions raised under other

21

statutes, he's still deciding a question under the VA Benefits

22

Laws.

36

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

the preclusion of review extends only to adjudications in

2

individual cases, or it applies to regulations as well.
The petitioners have argued that there has been very

little litigation on this subject, very few cases brought, even

5

though a number of circuits have permitted judicial review of

6

VA decisions in particular instances.

7

isn't whether we can predict whether flood gates will open and

8

the waters will rush in.

Congress was saying when it was writing the statute and whether

The question really

It's more important to look at what

10

it was concerned about flood gates, and the answer to that is,

12

In 1970, when 211 was amended to its present form as

13

this Court discussed in its decision in Johnson v. Robison, it

14

was done as a reaction to decisions by the D.C. Circuit that

15

had permitted review in certain circumstances.

16

legislative history which is discussed in Johnson v. Robison,

17

and is also discussed in then Judge Scalia's opinion in the

18

case of Gott v. Walters, indicates that there was concern that

19

there were 353 cases pending in the D.C. Circuit alone, and

20

that there was concern that future cases would be brought based

21

on individual benefits determinations and regulations.

And the

22

And that was part of Congress' concern and that is

23

part of the basis upon which Congress amended the Statute to

24

read the way it does today.

25

QUESTION:

How did it read before the amendment?

MR. GANZFRIED:

Heritage

It used the term, claims, and what
3.7
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

the D.C. Circuit had said, well, that would preclude judicial

2

review if you're'coming in and applying for benefits, but in

3

instances where benefits were discontinued or benefits were

4

forfeited for some reason, the Court had held that you can come

5

into court because that's not a claim for benefits, that's

6

something that happens after you're already getting benefits.
And Congress came in and said, no, we want no review;

7
8

we don't want to involve the courts in the day to day workings

9

of the VA.

Now, would a decision that you could challenge

10

regulations, even the validity of regulations under other

11

statutes interfere with the day to day workings of the VA?

12

the answer to that is, yes.

And

Just one example is that the VA has a regulation on

13
14

the ratings for disability of malaria.

It's got four

15

categories that rate the disability from 100 percent to 50

16

percent to 30 percent to 10 percent.

17

such things as whether there have been three relapses in a six

18

month period or two relapses in a six month period.

that someone could claim that current medical evidence makes

20

that distinction inappropriate, that two serious relapses is

21

more important than three not so serious relapses, and that he

Ganzfried?

13

MR. GANZFRIED:

14

QUESTION:

Sure.

Do you agree with the view taken by then-

15

judge Scalia in the McKelvey case that the Administrator

16

necessarily decided in the benefit claims case that the

17

regulation was consistent with the Rehab Act?

18

MR. GANZFRIED:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

I didn't hear the middle part â

Judge Scalia's view in the McKelvey case,

do you agree with it?
MR. GANZFRIED:

I think that view as amplified in his

22

opinion in the Gott case, Gott v. Walters, an earlier case that

23

of the briefs mentioned briefly in a quotation in our brief.

QUESTION:

8

MR. GANZFRIED:

9

Let me say something about a case, considering the

10

subject matter of this case it is quite astonishing that the

11

case has not been mentioned before.

12

that this Court has been asked to consider the legal

13

ramifications of alcoholism.

14

refused to accept the blanket rule that alcoholics may not be

15

asked to bear some degree of responsibility for their conduct,

16

criminal responsibility in that case.

17

that alcoholism is not merely status, it involves conduct,

18

drinking, for which there may be an element of volition, at

19

least at some point in the progression leading toward chronic

alcoholism.

With respect to the language of willful misconduct,

it derives from the statutes that deal with veterans benefits

seriously claim that a disability compensation which amounts to

13

sole disability is alcohol abuse or drug abuse.

14

mention that the VA has a regulation that treats drug abuse,

15

for the purposes of these programs, in a similar way to the way

16

it treats alcoholism.

17

And I should

Because to take that position would be tantamount to

18

paying that person for life to continue drinking or taking

19

drugs, and would discourage treatment or rehabilitation.

20

it is certainly an appropriate response for Congress to take to

say that funds would be better spent on rehabilitation and

treatment than on simply providing pensions and disability

compensations.
