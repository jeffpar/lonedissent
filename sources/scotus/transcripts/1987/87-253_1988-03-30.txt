ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES FRIED

ON BEHALF OF FEDERAL APPELLANT

11
12

87-775,

Mr. Fried, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

8

10

87-

MR.

FRIED:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In 1981 Congress passed the Adolescent and Family

13

Life Act in response to what it considered the grave social,

14

economic, and health consequences of early adolescent pregnancy

15

and childbirth.

1*6

It undertook to enlist the aid of a wide variety of

17

community groups to combat this problem in providing the

18

assistance of federal grants for two kinds of services:

19

prevention services,

20

relations, and care services, directed principally at pregnant

21

adolescents, and intended to give among other things,

22

of the following kind: pregnancy testing,

23

prenatal and postnatal care, venereal disease screening,

24

psychological and nutritional counseling, and a wide variety of

25

other services.

aimed at discouraging adolescent sexual

services

health services,

Congress sought to draw on the widest possible range

Heritage

4
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

of community resources, and therefore specifically provided

2

that among the class of grantees should be included religiously

3

affiliated organizations where appropriate.

4

Though religiously affiliated organizations have

5

participated without question throughout our history in the

6

care and counseling services funded at all levels of government

7

in areas such as juvenile delinquency, runaways, drug

8

addiction, physical and mental health, foster care, adoption,

9

and aging, the District Court struck down -- on its face and as

10

applied as violating the Establishment Clause -- this Act

11

insofar as it specifically adverted to the inclusion of

12

religiously affiliated organizations within the class of

13

permissable grantees.

14

The District Court's standard and reasoning was such

15

that I think no one in this Court -- not us and not the

16

Plaintiffs and their Amici -- defend it.

17

found a valid secular purpose here, and properly so, but found

18

that the Act had the primary effect of advancing religion,

19

thereby failing the second prong of the Lemon test, because --

20

and I am quoting here -- of its use of religious organizations

21

for education and counselling of teenagers on matters relating

22

to religious doctrine.

23

The District Court

We pressed on the District Court and renew the

24

argument here that the correct standard for determining whether

25

a law has the effect of advancing religion has been set out
many times in the decisions of this Court, and perhaps most
5

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

neatly in the decision of Hunt v. McNair, where it was said

2

that aid has the effect of advancing religion if, and I quote,

3

"it flows to an institution in which religion is so pervasive

4

that a substantial portion of its functions are subserved in

5

the religious mission, or if it funds a specifically religious

6

activity in an otherwise substantially secular setting."
And I suppose examples of that would be Stone v.

7

8

Graham or Abington School District v. Schempp.

Instead of

9

applying this familiar test, the District Court held that its

10

quite original and unprecedented test should be applied, at

11

least where, as in this act, this statute explicitly adverts to

12

religion.
The District Court thereby was able to reach its

13
14

conclusion that the Act was unconstitutional without making any

15

of the findings of fact which would be necessitated by the

16

established decisions of this Court, because it found that its,

17

and I quote,

18

statute down on summary judgment on its face and on the

19

pleadings.

20

"more neatly put test" allows it to strike this

This odd state of affairs explains the unusual, I

21

believe unusual submissions of this Court on the part of the

22

Plaintiff and their amici.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Fried, is it possible that as applied

24

this statute would meet the Hunt v. McNair standard that you

25

want us to apply?
MR. FRIED:

It certainly is possible.
6

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

It is

1

certainly possible that this statute could provide for grants

2

to religiously affiliated organizations which, nonetheless,

3

like the religiously affiliated organizations in Hunt, in

4

Tilton, in Roemer, nevertheless were not pervasively sectarian.

5

It is quite possible that the grants which are funded

6

would be grants which, unlike the activities in Schempp or

7

Stone v. Graham, are not specifically religious activities.

8

Both of those things are entirely possible, and indeed not only

9

possible, in our view on proper fact finding it would be

10

demonstrated they were what happened.
QUESTION:

11

Well, what do our cases tell us we should

12

do if we think a statute might be constitutional on its face

13

but not as applied, and if the evidence is there, to establish

14

that?

15

MR. FRIED:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. FRIED:

That is it constitutionally applied.
That it is unconstitutionally applied.
If it is unconstitutionally applied, then

18

I think the question becomes, is it capable of being

19

constitutionally applied?

20

first question in the affirmative, then what must be done is

21

that the relevant authorities must be directed to cease

22

applying the statute in an inappropriate way.

Well, plainly, by answering the

23

That is what has happened with Title I --

24

QUESTION:

25

Is that how the Court has handled aid to

parochial schools?
MR. FRIED:

I believe if you look at the most recent
7

Heritage

Corporation

1

instances, Aguilar and Grand Rapids, Title I, here was a

2

general program which, it turns out, a number of states were

3

not applying in an appropriate way.

4

applications inappropriate.

5

The Court so found those

And what has happened is those applications were

6

condemned, and now Title I is still alive and well, and it is

7

being applied differently, for instance, at this time.

8

remedial services which this Court said could not be provided

9

within parochial schools by public school teachers coming in,

Those

10

are being provided on premises separate from the parochial

11

schools to parochial school children.

12

Now those cases are also in litigation, but

13

nevertheless, the Secretary believes that he is acting

14

faithfully to the dictates of this Court.

15

how matters have proceeded.

So that, I think, is

16

There are certain programs, and I think Schempp would

17

be a perfect example, but also programs which have provided for

18

aid to, quote,

19

has found 92 per cent, 85 per cent, very large percentages of

20

the eligible schools were so pervasively sectarian that,

21

really, there was no room for constitutional applications, or

22

no substantial room.

23

"private schools" in contexts where the Court

That, I think, is how the matter has proceeded in the

24

decisions of this Court, and that is how I think it should

25

proceed in this case.
QUESTION:

Were there any findings in the District
8

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

Court where you would concede in this case that there were some

2

unconstitutional applications?
MR.

3

FRIED:

In our brief we said that there were some

4

departures, but I don't think, Justice Kennedy,

5

to say there were any findings of any sort in the District

6

Court.

7

This was on summary judgment,

it is correct

and what we had is a

8

sort of comprehensive wave of the hand in the direction of some

9

of the often quite disputed evidence.

But that,

I don't think,

10

constitutes conscientious fact finding such as Congress is

11

entitled to before one of its statutes is struck down.

12

The departures to which we are referring are noted on

13

page 41 of our brief.

14

have been departures.

15

QUESTION:

We do not dispute that there may well

You concede that all of those departures

16

were not just departures from the regulation,

17

unconstitutional?

18

MR.

19

QUESTION:

20
21

FRIED:

Well,

but were

I think â

Because in that respect I think you

diverge from the private Appellant here.
MR. FRIED:

I think that some of those departures are

22

departures not only from what the Secretary was directing, but

23

also departures from a fairly tight reading of some of the

24

decisions of this Court.

25

It is not the easiest thing in the world to arrive at
an entirely comprehensive test based on everything that this

Heritage

9
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

Court has said in all of these many cases, and therefore you

2

can read the cases tightly, or you can read them in a way that

3

is a little bit more generous.

4

We are proscribing a perfectly conservative reading

5

of the decisions of this Court.

6

reading we say, these are indeed constitutionally troublesome,

7

and we don't seek to defend them, and the Secretary did not

8

seek to authorize them.

9
10
11

And under the conservative

We don't think that is what is part of what we are
here defending.
QUESTION:

But there have been no findings by the

12

District Court on which to sort the ones that are

13

constitutionally suspect and those that are not.

14

MR. FRIED:

Plainly not.

Plainly not.

We simply

15

don't want to overstate the state of the record, Justice White.

16

The record is very voluminous here, and for us to tell you that

17

it does not contain some things which are questionable and

18

perhaps over the line would be an impermissible exaggeration,

19

and it's entirely unnecessary to our case to indulge in it.

20

QUESTION:

Is it available to us to make any

21

additional factual findings that are necessary?

22

lot of facts put in down there.

23

MR. FRIED:

There were a

It would be most unusual; this is not an

24

original action.

25

for this Court to make findings.

I can't imagine why it would be appropriate

Indeed, I have considerable sympathy for the
10

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1

situation of the Plaintiffs in this case, because unable, I

2

believe, to defend the judgment below on the basis of the

3

court's more neatly put rule -- that is to say, the rule which

4

it invented -- it is forced, really, to ask this Court to make

5

the necessary factual findings which would support a judgment

6

in their favor under the more familiar standards which this

7

Court has set out.

8
9

I think that is what explains the fact that the
Appellee's brief is so largely devoted to fact, and why they

10

return to the facts in a document which I can only describe as

11

their reply to our reply brief.

12
13
14

We cannot get into those facts, and we don't think it
is appropriate for the Court to do so either.
QUESTION:

Mr. Fried, can I ask you one question

15

about the procedure?

16

summary judgment, were there not?

17

MR. FRIED:

18

QUESTION:

I guess there were cross motions for

There were.
And I did not understand you to be arguing

19

that the case should be sent back for trial, but rather that

20

the record is adequate to decide the case one way or the other.

21

MR. FRIED:

If that is your impression, we have

22

mislead you, Justice Stevens.

Our view is that the summary

23

judgment should be reversed.

We did not appeal from the

24

denial of our own motion of summary judgment.

25

If the summary judgment is reversed, the case then
will proceed in the ordinary course to fact findings and
11

1

2

judgments and, I hope, a judgment guided -QUESTION:

Is it your view, then, that some of the

3

facts that the District Court thought were undisputed are, in

4

fact, disputed?

5

MR. FRIED:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. FRIED:

Absolutely.
I see.
Most definitely so.

If the Court wishes,

8

I could detail at considerable length where the court has

9

simply acted most inappropriately in finding things undisputed

10
11

which were vigorously disputed.
QUESTION:

That shouldn't be too hard to identify,

12

shouldn't it?

13

has a rule that requires, in a motion for summary judgment,

14

that the party making it set forth those facts that that party

15

believes to be undisputed.

16

The District Court, like most district courts,

MR. FRIED:

Well, that was done, and we then set

17

forth in our motion for summary judgment those facts that we

18

thought were disputed.

19

from the further labors that an extensive file would have

20

entailed by saying that we had not mentioned the matters in

21

dispute with sufficient particularity.

22

Now, the District Court absolved itself

It is very embarrassing to bring a matter like this

23

to this Court, a dispute as to whether a local rule was

24

followed or not.

25

Court of Appeals would take care of rather readily.

In ordinary course this is a matter which a

Unfortunately, we did not have the luxury of asking a
12

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1

Court of Appeals to direct the District Court to perform its

2

functions in a proper and conscientious fashion.

5>

Unfortunately, that is a task which we cannot help but ask this

4

Court to perform, because the direct appeal is our only

5

recourse.

6

Otherwise, the statute falls.
Now, in our view the statute is plainly

7

constitutional on its face.

8

Justice O'Connor, there is no reason in the world why

9

religiously affiliated organizations are necessarily

11

As I pointed out in my answer to

pervasively sectarian.
If that were so then Roemer, Hunt, and Tilton would

12

have been wrongly decided.

13

which the District Court leapt to which must be corrected, and

14

that is the notion that the activities here are specifically

15

religious because the counselling and the care -- which would

16

be given by the religiously affiliated organizations, though

17

for a proper secular purpose and though without any reference

18

to religion -- is for those religious persons inspired by their

19

own religious convictions.

There is one particular equation

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL

8

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT UNITED FAMILIES
MR. McCONNELL:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The single most important point I wish to make this

11
12

morning in my brief ten minutes is to clarify, precisely what

13

the legal question in this case is, because I agree with

14

Solicitor General Fried that the many factual allegations are

15

not appropriately before this Court on an appeal.
The legal question is whether otherwise qualified

16
17

private organizations must be excluded from the Adolescent

18

Family Life program solely on the basis of their religious

19

affiliation or inspiration.
Our position is that the Establishment Clause does

20
21

not require and the Free Exercise Clause does not permit

22

religious belief or affiliation to be the basis for a civil

23

disability.

24

conduct and their performance, and not according to their

25

beliefs.

AFLA grantees must be judged according to their

I would have thought that Cantwell v. Connecticut was
14

Heritage

Reportinq
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1

sufficient authority to establish that proposition.

Thus the

2

issue is not whether some grantees may have violated the terms

3

of the grant or even whether the terms of the grant are binding

4

on them; those are not disputed questions among any of the

5

parties in this Court.
If the District Court had held only that grantees who

6

7

use AFLA funds to teach or promote religion must be

8

disciplined, and in appropriate cases perhaps excluded, we

9

would not be here.
QUESTION:

10

Well, Mr. McConnell, do our cases support

11

the view that public funds may be used to teach secular

12

subjects in parochial schools to teenagers?
MR. McCONNELL:

13

No, Your Honor.

This Court has

14

consistently held that programs of aid to parochial schools --

15

which are predominantly sectarian institutions, in most of the

16

cases before this Court over 95 per cent of them being

17

sectarian -- is not a neutral program of secular education.
The reason for that seems quite evident.

18

Even though

19

the description of the program -- private education -- may

20

sound neutral on its face, in fact everyone understands that

21

the institutions involved are predominantly, almost exclusively

22

religious.

23

QUESTION:

Does this statute, in your view,

24

contemplate that parochial schools, for instance, could be

25

grantees in these programs?
MR. McCONNELL:

Heritage

I suppose so, Your Honor, so long as
15
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

the class of potential grantees includes a much wider category

2

than just parochial schools.

3

school cases is that the aid was targeted --

4

QUESTION:

The problem with the parochial

But it would contemplate that a parochial

5

school, for instance, could be a grantee and teach these

6

subjects in pregnancy prevention with federal funds.

7

MR. McCONNELL:

None of the grantees, in fact, have

8

been parochial schools, but I am not aware of any reason why

9

they would be excluded as one of a much broader range of

10
11

12

potential grantees under the program.
QUESTION:

And it is your position that as so

interpreted, it can be upheld under our precedents?

13

MR. McCONNELL:

14

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Should the Court, on remand, determine

15

whether any of these organizations are pervasively sectarian,

16

or is that an improper test?

17

MR. McCONNELL:

We have no quarrel with the test of

18

pervasively sectarian, and for this reason:

19

definitions -- which were, frankly, ignored by the District

20

Court -- a pervasively sectarian institution is one that is

21

simply incapable -- by virtue of being so permeated with

22

religion -- of distinguishing between the teaching or promotion

23

of religion on the one hand, and the carrying out of secular

24

purposes on the other.

25

under this Court's

Such an institution would be unable to comply with
the terms of the grant, which are legally binding in this case.
16

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1

Thus the exclusion of a pervasively sectarian organization is

2

not on the basis of its belief or affiliation, but on the basis

3

of a conclusion about its conduct.
And that is the fundamental point which I wish to

4
5

make this morning, which is that it is the conduct of the

6

grantees and not their tie to religion or their inspiration of

7

religion that has to be the basis for judgment.
We agree that religious organizations, like everyone

8
9

else, has to comply with the terms of the grant.

There is

10

nothing non-neutral about that, but neutrality, again, is the

11

key.

12

Secretary has administered in a way so as not to either favor

13

or disfavor religious organizations as such.

14

This is a program in which Congress intended and then the

It seems rather clear to us that the way in which to

15

be neutral in these matters is to insist upon objective,

16

secular, neutral criteria for the selection of grantees, and

17

not to either grant a grant to someone because they are

18

religious, or to deny the grant to the same organization

19

because they are religious.

2

Here Appellees' position has presented us with a

choice.

Either we can exclude all organizations solely on the

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

it said that to presume that counsellors from religious

20

organizations can put their beliefs aside when counselling an

21

adolescent on matters that are a part of religious doctrine is

22

simply unrealistic?

23

MS. BENSHOOF:

Absolutely, because every religious

operating under religious dictates whether they were religious
themselves or not.

ability of the organization to implement the program properly,

simply because one person is counselling out of religious
conviction and another person is counselling the same thing not

Heritage

32
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

out of religious conviction, that makes the difference.
MS. BENSHOOF:

No, you misconstrue my answer.

Obviously, there is going to be religious counselling whether
you fund a drug program for just secular grantees or sectarian
grantees.

But when you are funding a religiously affiliated

organization to do teaching and counselling, and they happen to
have religious mandates on that very same issue, that's the
kind of danger that raises the risk or potential or advancing
religion which the Establishment Clause prohibits.
But I think another things is very important to
consider in the answer to that question, and that is that we
are dealing with a statute --.your questions all rest on some
hypothetical statute that's not before the Court.
If you look at the congressional history, they wanted
a union between government and religion, it calls for religious
participation, and it has nothing in the statute that precludes
the teaching or advancing of religion.

Now, this is all the

more telling in the fact that there are 25 other prohibitions
and limitations on grantees in the statute.
I don't know of any other federal statute that funds
educational institutions, both sectarian and secular, that
doesn't have even one statutory guarantee.

In fact, the

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

Well, does that fact that it is

12

administrative rather than statutory affect your judgment of

13

the program"?

14

MS. BENSHOOF:

Yes, it does, and I think it has

15

affected this Court's judgment in the past.

16

Tilton v. Richardson there was a prohibition that eight members

17

of this Court struck out that said after 20 years we are going

18

to take out keeping the secular from the sectarian, and you

19

struck out that provision and said it had to be in the statute.

For example,

QUESTION:

1

Do you think the Court meant that the

2

case would have come out differently had the statute not been

3

amended?

4

MS. BENSHOOF:

Yes, and in fact, Justice White, when

5

he wrote the opinion in Regan upholding a New York statute that

6

gave parochial schools reimbursement for state mandated tests,

7

that case took care of a problem that this Court had struck

8

down in Levitt where there were no statutory guarantees, and

9

Justice White made it quite clear that if those kinds of

10

guarantees were not in the face of the statute, the outcome of

11

the case would have been different.

12

QUESTION:

Did the opinion there say that had they

13

only been administrative and not statutory, the result would

14

have been different?

15

MS. BENSHOOF:

No, they didn't, but I would like to

16

point out that this isn't even really administrative.

17

this is not a regulation, it's not a guideline, it's not in the

18

statute, and yet 25 other things are in the statute.

All it is is a grant condition that was put in after

20

we filed the lawsuit and after we wrote a brief saying that

21

this was necessary, then the government put it in, and it has

22

never enforced it.

23

In fact, in the motion for summary judgment by the

24

government, they put 726 facts before the District Court, and

25

only four of them had anything to do with monitoring a
statutory condition.

QUESTION:

school, it would only be used -for that.

back, and then you upheld it in the Regan decision.

MS. BENSHOOF:

6

Well, the problem with dwelling on the

fact â I think the importance of the fact of the

8

administrative regulation for this case is not that it would

constitutionalize anything, but its importance is to show how

half -- and we caught them at that during the deposition -- all

The District Court would still have struck the

Yes, because the pervasively sectarian

doctrine developed by this Court in the college aid case is

14

certainly not the heart of the Establishment Clause

15

jurisprudence, it is only a shorthand way to know it you should

16

go ahead and look at other factors.

17

I mean, the other factors are what is the nature of

18

the aid and what is the relationship between the government and

19

the program that is being created here.

of an invasive relationship than in Tilton, where you had to

Obviously, in 1899, when this Court upheld funding

there are religious dictates on what they can say and do on

these particular items funded under this act, reproductive

I would like to just briefly indicate

That is the heart of the difficulty, because from
