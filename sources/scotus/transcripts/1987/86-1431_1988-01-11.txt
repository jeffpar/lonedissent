ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. VAN AMBURG, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

9

MS. VAN AMBURG:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
For over 75 years since this Court's decision in

10

National Home v. Parrish, it's been the general rule that an

11

agency authorized by Congress to sue and be sued is liable for

12

prejudgment interest in the same way and under the same

13

circumstances as a private enterprise would be.

14

today seeks an exception to this general rule to deny interest

15

to employees of sue and be-sued agencies who have been the

16

victims of employment discrimination.

17

The Government

We believe that the issue in this case, that is,

18

whether or not an employee may recover prejudgment interest in

19

a Title VII case against the Postal Service is flatly resolved

20

by the application of a longstanding principle governing

21

resolution of claims against sue and be-sued agencies.

22

that principle is one first articulated by this Court in a 1940

23

case, FHA v. Burr known as the "liberal construction rule."

24
25

And

And that rule is that a sue and be-sued clause in the
charter of a Federal agency effects a broad waiver of immunity
and subjects that agency to suit and the natural incidence of

suit which a private enterprise would be liable for in the same

2

circumstances.

3

Court in a suit against the Postal Service, the Franchise Tax

4

Board case in 1984 interpreting the scope of the waiver of

5

immunity in the charter of the Postal Service.

That rule was more recently reaffirmed by this

6

The no-interest rule, which is another longstanding

7

rule which is to the effect that interest cannot be recovered

8

against the Government absent an express statutory waiver, is

9

not applicable to the Postal Service.

This Court, in another

10

Title VII case the last term, Library of Congress v. Shaw,

11

noted that the no-interest rule doesn't apply to agencies which

12

have assumed the status of a private commercial enterprise.

13

And typically Congress has waived the immunity of the

14

agency by inserting into its charter, a sue and be-sued clause.

15

We believe that the Postal Service is one such agency noted by

16

this Court in footnote 5 of the Shaw opinion.

17

rule doesn't apply to it because it does not have the status of

18

a sovereign for these purposes.

19

The no-interest

The Government's position is that there is not one

20

agency which fits within the footnote 5 exception of the Shaw

21

decision to the no-interest rule.

22

footnote 5 is superfluous; we think it's a reflection of this

23

Court's understanding of the 75-year-old rule that interest is

24

recoverable against a sue and be-sued agency.

25

We don't believe that

Is the Postal Service a footnote 5 agency?

Clearly,

the Franchise Tax Board case answers that question squarely.

Heritage

1

It is such an agency.

2

when it chartered it in the 1970 Postal Reorganization Act, to

3

operate as much like a private business as possible.

4

Franchise Tax Board, this Court stated that because of the

5

Charter of the Postal Reorganization Act, because of the

6

legislative history, we must assume that the Postal Service's

7

liability is the same as a private business.

8

assume that Congress did not intend to preserve sovereign

9

immunity for the Postal Service.

10

QUESTION:

Congress intended the Postal Service,

In

And we must also

Well, if this weren't a Title VII case,

11

don't you think that the Government would agree with you, with

12

everything you've said so far?

13

MS. VAN AMBURG:

I don't know if they'd admit it,

14

that interest is recoverable against a sue and be-sued agency,

15

but I would think they'd have to.

16

QUESTION:

What about the Postal Service, would they

17

agree with you in the Postal Service if this were an ordinary

18

lawsuit, rather than a Title VII case?

19

MS. VAN AMBURG:

I would hope they would because

20

there's so many consistent court decisions to the effect that

21

interest is recoverable against a sue and be-sued agency.

22

Those decisions have followed in the breach of contract

23

actions, other back pay actions.

24
25

Their position is based upon an inference, Justice
White, that under section 717, Congress intended to impose
equal liability upon all Federal Agencies regardless of whether

it's a sue and be-sued agency.
QUESTION:

I think their argument follows from Title

VII in Shaw.
MS. VAN AMBURG:

That's right.

But they don't

5

acknowledge that the Postal Service is a footnote 5 agency

6

where the no-interest rule doesn't apply.

7

717 does is lays out a statutory scheme for processing charges

for Federal employees.

QUESTION:

And that rule simply

Well, Ms. Van Amburg, I suppose at bottom,

14

we're dealing with waiver of sovereign immunity and the extent

15

to which it's been waived.

16

position that when Congress enacted Section 717 in Title VII,

17

that it was adopting a more limited waiver of sovereign

18

immunity, and that that more limited waiver should be read as

19

limiting the more general waiver enacted in the sue and be-sued

20

clause for the Postal Service.

21

MS. VAN AMBURG:

And I suppose you can take the

That's correct.

That's what the

22

Postal Service's position is.

23

in legislating against the backdrop of liberal construction

24

rule, and Congress knows how to express in a statute what it

25

wants to do if it wants to delimit the general waiver of a sue
and be sued agency.

However, Congress is experienced

It did that in the Federal Tort Claims Act
6

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

back in 1945.

Section 2679 of the Federal Tort Claims Act

2

explicitly states that the authority of any Federal agency to

3

sue and be sued in its own name shall not be construed to

4

authorize suits against such agency on claims cognizable under

5

the Federal Tort Claims Act.

6

Federal Tort Claims Act shall be the exclusive remedies.

And the remedies provided by the

So here Congress in the Federal Tort Claims Act

7
8

acknowledges that a sue and be sued clause in the charter of a

9

Federal agency can be a separate source of authority for

10

proceeding under suit or for certain remedies.

And Congress

11

did not do that in Title VII.

12

how to, but it simply is silent in Title VII about how to treat

13

sue and be sued agencies.

Not that it wouldn't have known

So I think that we have to defer to Congress'

14
15

experience in legislating against this long-standing liberal

16

construction rule which tells us that it's up to Congress to

17

draw the line on these delimitations of a general waiver

18

effected by a sue and be sued clause.
It shouldn't be the Court's inferring any

19
20

delimitations absent plain evidence of Congress' intent to

21

delimit the general waiver, or absent a grave interference with

22

a Governmental function, which I don't think we have in this

23

case.

There's certainly no policy reason for drawing the line

If Federal Express

I think that Congress

10

intended the Postal Service to bring its management

11

decisionmaking as nearly as possible up to the level of private

12

enterprise.
And so there really is no policy reason to draw the

13
14

line by inference here.

15

Section 717 is correct; that's the Government's argument.

16

Government wants the Court to infer a delimitation on the

17

general waiver from the language of Section 717, but all that

that language does is tell us how to process the charges for

And Justice O'Connor's point about

As the Government points out, you sued the

Postmaster General by name, rather than the Post Office, and

24

25

incorrect.

Well, you acknowledge 717 has some bearing

in the courtroom, then?

MS. VAN AMBURG:

QUESTION:

6

MS. VAN AMBURG:

It does.

Or maybe you made a mistake.
More by what it doesn't say than

7

what it does say.

I think its silence on the issue of whether

8

interest is recoverable is not particularly instructive,

9

because as this Court noted in the Shaw case, interest is an

10

element of damages that's historically been viewed as separate

11

from damages on a separate claim.

12

exclusiveness of the damages or the remedy for sue and be sued

13

agencies is more instructive, given what Congress had done in

14

the Federal Tort Claims Act.

15

But its silence on the

So if we are to conclude that the no-interest rule

16

applies to the Postal Service, we would be doing so undermining

this liberal construction rule which has been in place for 48

years now.

an irrelevant procedural distinction.

MS. VAN AMBURG:

In 1971, if we had brought an action

under Title VII?

5

QUESTION:

Yes.

6

MS. VAN AMBURG:

I would have to say the answer is,

7

no, because we didn't have a right to proceed under Title VII

8

at that time.

9
10

QUESTION:

And is the reason that you had no right,

did that have anything to do with sovereign immunity?

11

MS. VAN AMBURG:

QUESTION:

13

Your position is the only relevant

sovereign immunity was waived in 1970?

14

MS. VAN AMBURG:

15

QUESTION:

16

No.

That's correct.

And what happened in '72 was you got a

cause of action you didn't previously have.

17

MS. VAN AMBURG:

That's right.

It added a cause of

18

action against the Federal Agencies that did not previously

19

exist.

21

the purposes of interest and damages.

22

25

But the Postal Service comes into the 1972 law as a

QUESTION:

Why couldn't they have been sued as a

private enterprise under Title VII in 1971?
MS. VAN AMBURG:

Well, because of what we know of the

legislative history of the Postal Reorganization Act, Congress
expressly listed those Federal labor laws applicable to the
10

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

Postal Service in its charter and left out Title VII. And there

2

was some debate about it.

3

immunity; it was a debate whether to leave the employees of the

4

Postal Service under the Executive Order or to put them under

5

Title VII.

6

Title VII as a different kind of agency, the fact that they

7

even talked about putting them under Title VII.

The debate was not over sovereign

Which shows, I think, that Congress is viewing

8

But the issue was where would the employees be better

9

off, under the Executive Order or under Title VII, and that was

10

the debate.

But they later changed their mind about where

11

they'd be better off.

12

The issue of sue and be sued in the official name

13

versus the name of the Postmaster's the exact kind of issue

14

that was raised in FHA v. Burr, and dismissed by the Court.

15

Courts have been reluctant to draw procedural distinctions that

16

would sabotage this rule construing sue and be sued clauses

17

broadly.

18

I think that this Court rejected a similar procedural

19

distinction in the Franchise Tax Board case when you said we're

20

really not going to say that a suit in an administrative

21

proceeding is not covered under the sue and be sued clause

22

versus a suit in the courtroom.

23

distinction the courts have rejected.
QUESTION:

24
25

That's the kind of procedural

Why do you say that in 1972, Congress

created a cause of action, rather than eliminate the cause of
action?

I didn't mean to say that if I did.

Well, Justice Stevens made you do it.

That's the question he asked and you agreed with that.
MS. VAN AMBURG:

7

I don't think so.

I think that

8

there was a cause of action for employment discrimination back

9

then.

10

QUESTION:

Against the Post Office?

11

MS. VAN AMBURG:

It's certainly debatable, however,

12

under Title VII whether an employee could have gotten back pay.

13

An employee could have complained through the Executive Order

14

administrative process back then.

Was there a cause of action for damages by

Against the Postal Service.

Well, I mean the Postal Service as stated,

I mean, how would you sue the Postal Service under 1981?
MS. VAN AMBURG:

Well, in the same way you would sue

a private enterprise if you assume that the Postal Service
occupies the status of a private commercial enterprise, which
12

Heritage

Reporting Corporation

6

has not really been decided by this Court.
But in that two years, I don't think we know the
answer to that question.
QUESTION:
suable in 1971?

What's your position on whether they were

I'm really not quite clear.

MS. VAN AMBURG:

Well, there were some cases that

7

went into the Court of Claims under the Executive Order for

8

back pay, and I would say that they were suable back then, at

9

least in the Court of Claims.

Although this Court has, in

10

Brown v. GSA settled that in terms of forums, that Title VII

11

would be the exclusive remedy.

12

So, yes, I think they were suable back in 1971.

13

QUESTION:

In other words, you say the Executive

14

Order created a duty not to discriminate and a violation of

15

that duty, since the sovereign immunity had been waived, gave

16

rise to a cause of action in 1971.

17

MS. VAN AMBURG:

18

QUESTION:

That's right.

All that Title VII did was change the

19

procedure a little bit and make it a statutory duty instead of

20

an administrative duty?

21

MS. VAN AMBURG:

That's correct, that's our position.

22

And really all Title VII is is an exclusive

23

administrative scheme for getting into the Federal courtroom,

24

but once the employee's there, the damages are the same against

25

a sue and be sued agency.
If there are no further questions, I'll reserve some

time for rebuttal.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

6

9

MR. ROTHFELD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Both sides in this case agree that the so-called no
interest rule or the aptly named no-interest rule prevents the

10

award of interest to virtually all Federal employees who obtain

11

Title VII judgments against the United States.

12

question in this case is whether Congress created a special

13

exception to this limitation on Title VII for the benefit of

14

the Federal workers who are employed by the Postal Service, a

15

benefit that gives those workers, in contrast to all other

16

Federal employees, a right to interest on a Title VII awards.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

The only

Well, if this weren't a Title VII suit,

say it was a contract action against the Postal Service.
MR. ROTHFELD:

We don't disagree with the petitioners

20

as a general matter a sue and be sued clause in that sort of

21

proceeding, a contract-type proceeding is a waiver of sovereign

22

immunity which may entitle it to --

24

QUESTION:

So your submission is that the Title VII

717 really took away that waiver to some extent?
MR. ROTHFELD:
the waiver.

Well, I wouldn't say that it took away

We think that Section 717 is a separate waiver and

Heritage

14
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

it is the dispositive waiver in this case.

2

way in which Congress created the Postal Service and the way in

3

which it regulated the relationship between the Postal Service

4

and its employees provide an independent reason.

5
6

7

QUESTION:

Also I think the

So you should look at this 717 just as a

waive with respect to Title VII suits?
MR. ROTHFELD:

We think that's right.

We think this

8

is a case about Title VII, it was brought under Title VII, it

9

is a Title VII case.

Now, obviously before anyone obtains any

10

kind of judgment against the United States, there must be two

11

things; there must be a waiver of sovereign immunity and there

12

must be a cause of action.

13

must do two things; it must find a waiver of sovereign immunity

14

and decide if the waiver which is controlling here is broad

15

enough to allow for awards of interest.

16

QUESTION:

To resolve this case, the Court

I really am puzzled because if the sue and

17

be sued clause enacted in 1970 was a general waiver of

18

sovereign immunity for any claims for which there was a cause

19

of action and a remedy, why wasn't, to the extent that

20

sovereign immunity would otherwise bar the recovery of

21

interest, why hadn't that been waived?

22

there was no cause of action, but you don't really contend that

23

in '72, they cut back on the waiver?

24

MR. ROTHFELD:

25

QUESTION:

There just simply,

No, not at all.

You're saying that all they did in '72 was

create a cause of action which hadn't been created.

6

Well, I don't think that's a proper

Well, I think that was the final

landing place for the petitioner.
And I think that there are two responses to that.

11
12

One involves the nature of the waiver which is controlling

13

here.

14

its relationship to its employees.

15

The other involves the nature of the Postal Service and

Answering your question now, in particular, we think

16

that that analysis that it was the sue and be sued clause which

17

was the waiver here and that Title VII simply created a cause

18

of action is not the proper way to view this case.

19

relationship between the two statutes makes that quite clear.

20

And the

Congress passed Title VII in 1964 and at the time, it

21

preserved the sovereign immunity of the United States by

22

excepting from the definition of employer, the Federal

23

Government including the old Post Office Department.

24

Therefore, no part of the Federal Government could be sued

25

under Title VII after its enactment in 1964.
Six years later in 1970 --

QUESTION:

1

Well, you could regard that as reserving

2

sovereign immunity, or you could regard that as not creating a

3

cause of action.

4

And I don't know how to —

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think it was both, Justice

5

Scalia.

Congress typically waives the sovereign immunity of

6

the United States as we think it did in this case by enacting a

7

cause of action.

8

immunity to the extent that the cause of action has been

9

created, and therefore they are two sides of the same coin.

The cause of action waives the sovereign

The Court, in Shaw, for example, characterized the

10
11

1972 provision of Title VII as a waiver of sovereign immunity.

12

It was those provisions which created the cause of action.

13

the usual case, there's no point in distinguishing between the

14

waiver and the cause of action.

Yes, but there, there had been no

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think there are two answers to

21

that, Justice Stevens.

First, let me just spell out a little

22

bit how the system worked from 1964 to 1972.

23

Congress created the Postal Service it preserved, we think, the

24

sovereign immunity as to employment discrimination claims.

25

Congress specifically considered extending to the Postal

It decided not to do that.
So in 1970, it was quite clear that a Postal employee

3

could not sue the Federal Government under Title VII.
QUESTION:

4

But can't you describe that in either of

5

two ways: one, as you do now, they were preserving a portion of

6

sovereign immunity; or simply say, they just didn't create the

7

cause of action?

8

MR. ROTHFELD:

9

QUESTION:

Well, I think they were doing both.

Supposing you had a statute passed today

10

that created a cause of action against the Postal Service for

11

late delivery of mail?

12

mail be delivered within a week, and if it's over 30 days late,

13

well, you get a dollar a day or something.

Say there's an implied promise that the

18

I think you might if you're suing

QUESTION:

But again, we think it's —

Brand new cause of action, you just waived

sovereign immunity as to late delivery of mail.
MR. ROTHFELD:

19

That's quite right, Justice Stevens,

20

but the crucial point is not when the cause of action was

21

created.

22

after the enactment of the sue and be sued clause may be

23

brought under that clause.

24

clause here is not the waiver of sovereign immunity.

25

We certainly agree that causes of action created

But there are two reasons why the

sector provisions of Title VII which grant a remedy for

employment discrimination to all Federal employees, Congress

2

viewed that as you say, as creating a cause of action.

3

clearly said at the time, and the Court has since recognized

4

that that was a blanket waiver of sovereign immunity.

blanket waiver as the waiver which made these suits possible.

13

It doesn't affect the identity of the waiver of
Congress viewed that

And I think there is clear textual evidence of that,

14

and that is the second reason for saying that it is Title VII

15

and not the sue and be sued clause that is the waiver here.

16

Those two provisions actually authorize suits against different

17

named defendants, as Justice Scalia noted.

18

Title VII waives the Government's immunity in suits brought

19

against the head of the defendant's agency.

20

case is captioned, Loeffler v. Tisch, Postmaster General.

21

Section 717(c) of

That is why this

In contrast, the sue and be sued clause makes the

22

Postal Service amenable to suit in its official name.

23

that is why a typical suit that is brought pursuant to the

24

clause in which the clause is the waiver is captioned something

25

like, Freed v. U.S. Postal Service.

Now, this obviously is a

technical distinction but it has real significance.

Heritage

And

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

The courts

1

will uniformly dismiss Title VII actions that are brought

against the agency rather than against the agency head.

means that this case can proceed only because it is Title VII

4

that makes the Postmaster General amenable to process.

That

And if it is Title VII that makes the defendant

5
6

amenable to suit, it must be Title VII itself that provides the

7

relevant waiver of immunity here.
Now, in turn, the Court has made it quite clear

8
9

repeatedly that it is the statute waiving immunity that sets

10

out the conditions under which the Government has agreed to be

11

sued.

12

the Title VII waiver is that it does not authorize awards of

interest to employees suing any part of the Federal Government.

MR. ROTHFELD:

Certainly, without a waiver of sovereign immunity, an

8

express waiver somewhere, petitioner could not sue and get its

9

hands on that cash.

And that we think is the first dispositive

10

reason for ruling for the Postal Service here.

The waiver of

11

sovereign immunity in this case is Title VII.

That waiver does

12

not allow for awards of interest.

13

waiver of sovereign immunity, the only waiver that allows the

14

suit to proceed, is not broad enough to allow them to obtain

15

awards of interest under this Court's holding in Shaw.

16

Therefore, the express

And there is also, as I suggested, a second

17

independent reason for ruling for the Postal Service in this

18

case, which is not at all technical or sophisticated.

19

simple matter of Congressional intent.

20

the sue and be sued clause is the source of the waiver here —

21

and we don't think that it is -- but even if that were true,

22

all that would mean is that the clause allows petitioner to

23

bring the Postal Service into court.

24

that provides the cause of action.

25

that defines the scope of the relief here.

It's a

If Congress had said expressly in Title VII that Federal

employees could not obtain interest under that statute, it is

quite clear that nothing in the sue and be sued clause could

4

change that outcome.

5

Court has already held in Shaw that Title VII does not

Now, Ms. Van Amburg's response to that point this

morning has been to suggest that the Federal sector provisions

other Federal employees, while granting interest to employees

with that approach.

The question here is a much narrower one.

And in particular, in the Title VII contracts, the differences

between Postal Service employees and Federal employees on the

remain whether or not the Postal Service is viewed as being

like a private corporation, and whether or not the rights of

into the rural risk insurance business in competition with
