ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS W. MERRILL, ESQUIRE

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. MERRILL:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is the Court's first encounter with the unique

10

11

attorneys' fee statute, the Equal Access to Justice Act, or

12

EAJA.

13

competing objectives.

14

EAJA reflects an attempt by Congress to balance two

On the one hand, Congress was concerned that

15

individuals and small businesses might be discouraged from

16

challenging unreasonable Government action because they could

17

not afford the expense of hiring an attorney.

18

On the other hand, Congress thought that if

19

attorneys' fees were routinely awarded against the Government

20

in a case where the Government was not the prevailing party,

21

this might inhibit vigorous enforcement of the law, or chill

22

attempts by the Government to advance in good faith novel but

23

credible extensions and interpretations of the law.

24
25

In an effort to accommodate these two competing
objectives, Congress adopted two provisions which are both at

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

4
1

2

issue in this case.
First, EAJA does not award attorneys' fees to

3

everyone who prevails.

4

of fees is available only if the Government takes a position

5

that is not substantially justified.

6

It specifically provides that an award

Second, although EAJA provides that an attorney's fee

7

must be reasonable, it imposes a cap on what is considered to

8

be a reasonable attorney's fee equal to $75.00 an hour, which

9

can be exceeded only because of inflation or other narrowly

10

defined special factors.

11

QUESTION:

Other such factors?

12

MR. MERRILL:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. MERRILL:

Other special factors such as.

Such as.
Yes.

15

in my argument, Justice White.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. MERRILL:

I hope to get to that issue later

Yes, I'm sure you will.
The first issue in this case, however,

18

is the meaning of "substantial justification."

19

history makes it clear that in general the Government's

20

position is substantially justified if it is reasonable.

21

The legislative

Thus, even if the Government ultimately loses the

22

case, it is not required to pay attorneys' fees under EAJA if

23

its position was one as to which reasonable persons might

24

genuinely disagree about the outcome.

25

The 1980 legislative history repeatedly equates

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

5
1

substantial justification with reasonableness.

Eleven Courts

2

of Appeals interpreted "substantially justified" to mean

3

"reasonable."

4

changes were made in the statutory language, but Congress

5

maintained the substantial justification formula without

6

modification.

When EAJA was re-enacted in 1985, several minor

Thus, we think that the meaning of "substantial

7
8

justification," at least in the abstract, is clear.

9

"reasonable."

10

It means

The difficulty comes in applying this standard

in individual cases, as this case illustrates.

11

Here, looking at virtually identical facts, the Court

12

of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the Secretary of HUD

13

was not substantially justified in refusing to implement the

14

operating subsidy program authorized by Congress in 1974, and

15

subsequently repealed in 1981.
The Second Circuit, however, held that the Secretary

16
17

was substantially justified in refusing to implement that

18

subsidy.
QUESTION:

19

Is there any reason why Congress didn't

20

use the perfectly good word "reasonable," if it meant

21

"reasonable"?
MR. MERRILL:

22

Well, Justice Scalia, the legislative

23

history suggests that the substantially justified formula was

24

borrowed verbatim from Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil

25

Procedure.

And I think there is also some indication in the

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

6
1

legislative history that Congress was particularly attracted to

2

that because it was clear under that formulation that the

3

Government had the burden, and Congress was particularly

4

anxious to establish that the Government had the burden of

5

showing it as substantially justified, or reasonable, or

6

whatever.

7

Now, obviously, they could have done that by saying

8

the Government has the burden of showing that it is reasonable.

9

But Congress chose not to do that.

10

There is an episode in the legislative history, the

11

1980 legislative history, which is discussed in the briefs,

12

where the Senate, without explanation, the Senate committee,

13

rejected an amendment that would changed "substantially

14

justified" to "reasonably justified," but there is no

15

explanation for that.

16

to say that "substantially justified" means "reasonable."

And the Senate Committee Report goes on

17

So I cannot answer the question any better than that.

18

There are a number of reasons why in this case we

19

think the Second Circuit was right and the Ninth Circuit wrong

20

in the substantial justification inquiry.

21

First of all, the Secretary's decision not to

22

implement the operating subsidy was quintessentially a policy

23

choice about what to do with limited resources.

24

Congress had authorized the Secretary to enter into contracts

25

to implement the operating subsidy program, it had not released

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

Although

7
1

sufficient contract authority to permit the Secretary to

2

implement that subsidy program and to meet her commitments

3

under other programs.
QUESTION:

4
5

I suppose just the disagreement between

two Courts of Appeals almost makes your case on your approach?
MR. MERRILL:

6

Ironically, Justice White, there is a

7

pending application or motion, I guess, before the District

8

Court in California to award fees for the expense of engaging

9

in the fee litigation in this case; and if our theory is right

10

about what "substantially justified" means, we should be able

11

to win that litigation because of the conflict in the Circuits.
QUESTION:

12

Mr. Merrill, may I ask what standard we

13

should use to review the lower court's finding that the

14

Government's litigating position was not substantially

15

justified?

16

it de novo as a matter of law, or does it vary from case to

17

case, depending on whether it is a matter of failure to meet a

18

burden of proof or a legal question?

19

Is it an abuse of discretion thing or do we look at

MR. MERRILL:

Certainly we think that in this case

20

the appropriate standard is de novo.

21

that have considered this question have so concluded.

22

lower courts, including the Ninth Circuit, have held that an

23

abuse of discretion standard is appropriate.

24
25

Most of the lower courts
A few

We think a de novo standard is particularly critical
at this stage, or with respect to the issues involved in this

8

1

case, because the primary thrust of our argument here is that

2

the Court should, if at all possible, try to construe the

3

"substantially justified" requirement in terms of objective

4

indicators of reasonableness, and if the courts are to develop

5

such objective indicators of reasonableness, it is important

6

that we have appellate review of decisions as to what kinds of

7

circumstances constitute substantial justification and which

8

kinds do not.

9

discretion of the trial courts, then we will be faced with a

If everything is simply left up to the ad hoc

10

totality of the circumstances kind of approach in almost every

11

instance, which we argue is highly wasteful and duplicative.

12

QUESTION:

May I ask, in that connection, do you

13

think that the Judge who tried the case, or the Court of

14

Appeals that might have handled the appeal, the feeling of that

15

Judge as to the difficulty of the issues, how close they were,

16

and so forth, is that one of the objective factors that would

17

be counted, or not?

18

MR. MERRILL:

No.

Our notion of objective indicators

19

of reasonableness is essentially keyed to what we think

20

"reasonableness" means.

21

reasonable person or attorney could have agreed with the

22

Government's position at the outset of the litigation.

23

QUESTION:

"Reasonableness" means that a

What if the District Judge said, I don't

24

see how any reasonable attorney could have brought this case,

25

based on my study of the law in the case and the arguments on

both sides?

You would say that?

MR. MERRILL:

We do not think that would be an

objective indicator that would be conclusive.
QUESTION:

I am no suggesting it is necessarily

5

conclusive.

6

appropriately weighed?

7

MR. MERRILL:

8

QUESTION:

9

Its own reaction to the case?

10

11
12

13

But would it be one of the factors that would be

Yes.

By the Judge and by the Court of Appeals?

MR. MERRILL:

In a case where there is no objective

indicator of reasonableness -QUESTION:

Well, I am asking, is this one of the

objective indicators?

14

MR. MERRILL:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. MERRILL;

No, it's not.

It's not.
We understand objective indicators of

17

reasonableness to be something which basically ends the

18

argument about whether the Government was substantially

19

justified or not.

20

would be that kind of factor.

21

the circumstances case where you didn't have an objective

22

indicator, that would certainly be something that would be

23

taken into consideration.

What else could he or she

look at?
MR. MERRILL:

2

In that kind of situation, it may very

3

well be that the only thing to do is to engage in a kind of

4

totality of the circumstances analysis, in which the Trial

5

Judge's subjective reactions to the case obviously loom fairly

6

large.
Bear in mind that EAJA does not say that the

8

Government is not substantially justified simply because it

9

failed to win on the merits.

10

QUESTION:

No, of course not.

11

MR. MERRILL:

And it is a little bit hard, obviously,

12

for District Judges, having just ruled against the Government,

13

to turn around and say well, even though I find the Government

14

lost, they are substantially justified.

I think judges very frequently decide one

way but acknowledge to themselves that the case was not an easy

one.

19

That is certainly not an unusual situation for a judge to

MR. MERRILL:

We certainly do not argue that every

20

case can be resolved by objective indicators either of

21

reasonableness or of unreasonableness, and when there are no

22

such objective indicators, we simply think that the lower

23

court's approach in looking at the totality of the

24

circumstances is the best way to proceed at this point in

25

implementing EAJA.

is to say, if it is a matter on which there has been a circuit

The even does not happen until after the

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

628-4888

12

1

But we think it is important to draw a distinction

2

between the analytical question of at what point in time do you

3

ask whether or not the Government was substantially justified,

4

and in this case there is general agreement that the point in

5

time is when the Secretary of HUD decided to defend against

6

this nationwide class action suit -- to distinguish between

7

that issue and the issue of what kind of evidence a Court can

8

look at, in order to make up its mind as to whether or not a

9

reasonable person could have disagreed about the Government's

10

position.

We think that evidence which emerges or develops

11

after the time the suit is instituted can be very highly

12

probative on that question.
For example, if there were no circuit split when the

13
14

case was filed but subsequently one developed, we think that

15

certainly that would be relevant evidence that sheds light

16

on the reasonableness of the Government's decision to have

17

litigated.

18

Court granted a stay pending review as subsequent phase of the

19

litigation, and granted certiorari to cases raising the

20

identical issue, is highly probative.

21
22

And in this case, we think that the fact that this

QUESTION:

Do you ever think you could win a case

that it was unreasonable to litigate?

23

MR. MERRILL:

24

QUESTION:

25

Excuse me?

Don't you think it is possible to begin

litigation which is unreasonable, and you were foolish to do

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

628-4888

13
1

it, but for some reason, something comes up, a new argument is

2

developed, and you win?

3

MR. MERRILL:

4

QUESTION:

Isn't that possible?
Yes, that is quite possible.

Well, if that is so, then, then if even

5

winning the case does not prove that you were reasonable teo

6

begin it in the first place, how can the mere fact that some of

7

the judges thought you should have won it prove that you were

8

reasonable to bring it in the first place?

9

MR. MERRILL:

Well, subsequent developments, I think,

10

are highly probative in the context where the basic legal

11

issues are the same when the subsequent rulings come down as

12

they were when the initial decision was made.

13

that although there were some modest changes in the statute

14

that took place in this case, the basic issues, the basic

15

statutory language was the same, the basic rationale that the

16

Secretary gave was the same.

17

grant a stay pending review and the grants of certiorari, we

18

think, are extremely probative of the question of whether it

19

was reasonable for the Government to essentially defend the

20

decision of the Secretary in the first place.

21

Now, you are right.

And I think

And so this Court's decision to

It is possible to imagine a case

22

where something happens, Congress passes a new statute that

23

suddenly changes the Government's position so that it is no

24

longer justified, for example.

present a special inquiry as to whether the Government was

Those kind of unique cases may

substantially justified in persisting with the litigation.

2

I suppose it is also possible to imagine a situation

3

where a subsequent event could change the landscape such

4

that --

5

QUESTION:

Like the Supreme Court changing its mind.

6

You know, no reasonable lawyer would have thought that we were

7

ready to change a settled course of law, and someone takes a

8

run at it, and it's a very foolish thing to do, and he wins.

9

MR. MERRILL:

Yes.

I think it is analytically

10

possible that one could say in some case -- I don't think it is

11

this case -- but in some case, the Government was not

12

substantially justified at the outset, but then the legal

13

landscape changed and it became substantially justified.

14

don't think that is the case here because I think that the

15

basic elements of the law remain unchanged and all we really

16

have is confirmation through this Court's decision and through

17

the grants of certiorari of the reasonableness of a decision

18

that the Secretary took to defend the case in the first place.

19

QUESTION:

I

If you can't take into consideration any

20

subsequent events like lawsuits analyzing the Government's

21

contentions, and the Court opinion, then I suppose that the

22

District Court deciding has simply got to study the law as it

23

existed and almost make a brand new lawsuit out of the thing.

That is correct, Justice Rehnquist.

would be, we think, quite artificial to have an absolute line

1

that says you have to draw the veil and you cannot look at

2

anything that happens after the complaint was filed.
I should point out that the Respondents don't agree

3
4

with any such rule, either because they stress the fact that

5

the case was resolved without a trial and that there was

6

ultimately a favorable settlement of the case in favor of

7

Plaintiffs and clearly those are subsequent events that

8

occurred after the filing of the complaint.

9

occurred quite a bit after this Court granted a stay and

The settlement

10

certiorari.

So both sides in this case are, in effect, arguing

11

that courts should be able to look to events that occur after

12

the filing of the complaint.

13

genuinely arguing that the courts have to draw the curtain at

14

the time the complaint was filed and cannot look to subsequent

15

events.
QUESTION:

16

No party in this case is

What consideration are you giving a

17

hypothetical case where everybody agrees that you cannot

MR. MERRILL:

19

20
21

everybody?

What do you mean, Justice Marshall, by

All the courts that have considered the issue?
QUESTION:

No.

The trial court ruled against you but

22

told you quietly that you would win in the Supreme Court, and

23

the highest court in the state tells you the same thing.

24

you come up here and you lose.

25

MR. MERRILL:

Heritage

Then

Well, Justice Marshall, I think our

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

16

1

objective indicators of reasonableness theory would be limited

2

to things that are on the record, like stays and grants of

3

certiorari and decisions by judges.

4

anything like a wink or a nod or a private communication could

5

constitute an objective indicator.

QUESTION:

I don't think that

That's what I say.

If you go outside the

record, you are going to get in trouble.
MR. MERRILL:

That's right.

And in fact, Congress,

in its 1985 amendments -- Congress made a number of modest

10

amendments in 1985.

11

substantial justification inquiry was to be made on the record

12

and that the courts were not to essentially take additional

13

evidence on the question of reasonableness.

14

One of them was to make it clear that the

In any event, we think that in this case, although

15

there are several indicators that support the reasonableness of

16

the Secretary — the discretionary nature of the policy choice,

17

the statutory language, the fact that the D.C. Circuit in the

18

Lindy case had decided only one year before on basically

19

identical statutory language, that the Secretary had discretion

20

not to implement the larger program under the Housing Act,

21

Section 236, that was at issue, that the Secretary's judgment

22

to litigate was reasonable.

23

grants, we think, not only confirm that judgment, but are so

24

probative that they constitute objective indicators of

25

reasonableness.

Heritage

But the stay and the

17

Now, with respect to the stay, we say that, because

1
2

it is well established that one of the elements that a party

3

has to show, has to make a strong showing on in order to grant

4

a stay, is a showing of a reasonable possibility of success on

5

the merits.

6

Court must have concluded that there was a reasonable

possibility of success on the merits when it granted the stay

this is a case that involved a great deal of money, did it not?

Fifty or sixty or seven million dollars?

MR. MERRILL:

16

QUESTION:

It involved $60 million.

And it was perfectly clear that if the

17

judgments were not stayed, the money would be disbursed and it

18

couldn't have been recovered, which is a very powerful reason

19

for granting a stay without looking too closely at the merits.

2

You would like it to be, and would not

want to discourage that, would you?
MR. MERRILL:

3

No, not at all.

I must say though,

4

that although we would concede that there may be some tradeoffs

5

in deciding whether or not to grant a stay between the balance

6

of equities or the irreparable harm element, and the likelihood

of success on the merits, there is no suggestion in any of the

QUESTION:

Mr. Merrill, was that view of when we

was the criterion we would use?

17

Do you think that it was crystal clear that that

There is some discussion of that in the

briefs, Justice O'Connor.

19

that, as a matter of logic, it was clear.

appeals, for example, that the Court had to consider

22

23

Justices would agree to grant certiorari.

there would really be no point in granting a stay, even if one

2

point in granting a stay if there was not a significant chance

that the judgment below was going to be reversed.

4

QUESTION:

Well, I think that is perfectly clear now.

5

But of course, the concern is that at the time this one was

6

granted, maybe the Court was just concerned about the dispersal

7

of the money, as Justice Stevens had suggested.
MR. MERRILL:

8
9

Well, I think the dispersal of the

money probably was a substantial factor.
QUESTION:

10

Isn't there another factor, too, Mr.

11

Merrill,

in all candor?

I think the Court does have great

respect for your office.

QUESTION:

On the grant of the stay, the mere fact

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

that the Solicitor General has been willing to apply for a stay

shows that the Solicitor General thought it was a close

Therefore, it must be a reasonable action.

I cannot think of any other area where we determine
reasonableness on the basis that a reasonable person did it.
QUESTION:

And the Solicitor General doesn't always

do what the department asks it to.
MR. MERRILL:

Well, I think Congress clearly did not

intend that any judgment by the Solicitor General or by any

20

responsible Cabinet Officer would be, by definition, a

21

reasonable act under EAJA.

sure that officials of the Government thought long and hard

23

before they took action and therefore that the incidence of

24

unreasonableness would be reduced.

25

QUESTION:

The whole point of EAJA was to make

Mr. Merrill, I have a little concern that

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

21
1

if we were to place the amount of weight that you would have us

2

place on a grant of certiorari or a stay here, which, as has

3

been indicated, we often do out of substantial deference to the

4

reguest of the Solicitor General, that we would have to change

5

our posture on that if we knew that then that was going to be

6

determinative in a later fee application under EAJA.

7

just wonder if that is wise?
MR. MERRILL:

8
9
10

And I

We certainly would not want the Court

to change its standards in response to attorneys' fee
litigation, Justice O'Connor.
The stay situation is, guite frankly, probably

11
12

somewhat of an unusual one in EAJA litigation.

13

much more common situation that the Government encounters is

14

one where there is some kind of disagreement among the courts

15

on the question and our approach of objective indicators I

16

think would only in an unusual case involve assessments of stay

17

and certiorari grants, and much more commonly would involve

18

things like whether or not a disagreement among lower court

19

judges was sufficient to establish the reasonableness of the

20

Government's action.
There are really two issue here.

21

I think that a

One is whether or

22

not the objective indicators approach makes sense, as a general

23

matter, and secondly, whether or not, in this case, the stay

24

and the

25

of reasonableness.

certiorari grants were bona fide objective indicators

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

22

We would strongly urge the Court to consider the

1

2

utility of the objective indicators approach, and even if the

3

Court disagrees with us about the stay and the certiorari

4

grant, we think that, when you look at the total circumstances

5

in this case, that our action was substantially justified from

6

that perspective as well as under an objective indicators

7

analysis.

8

Let me turn, if I may, to the second issue in this

9

case, which is whether or not the lower courts properly

10

adjusted the fees to levels as high as $120.00 an hour.

11

is unique among attorneys' fee statutes in that it imposes an

12

cap on reasonable attorneys' fees equal to $75.00 an hour.

13

statute sets forth two exceptions to the cap:

14

that there has been an increase in the cost of living, and

15

second, a finding that a special factor such as the limited

16

availability of qualified counsel for the proceedings involved

17

requires a higher fee.

18

EAJA

The

first a finding

The lower courts in this case we think all but wrote

19

the $75.00 cap out of the statute.

20

the "special factor" language of EAJA permits courts to look to

21

any and all of the 12 factors that were identified in Johnson

22

v. Georgia Highway Express in making upward adjustments above

23

and beyond the $75.00 limit.

24
25

In effect, they found that

The problem with this approach is that the Johnson
factors were designed to establish reasonable attorneys' fees i

2

Johnson factors can be taken into account as a special factor

3

which justifies an increase above the $75.00 limit, the net

4

effect would be the same as if Congress had mandated no cap at

5

all.

6

Thus, if each of the

Moreover, there is nothing in the legislative history

7

of EAJA that suggests that Congress wanted the courts to look

8

at the 12 Johnson factors in deciding whether to go beyond the

9

$75.00 cap.

In this respect, EAJA is quite different from the

10

Civil Rights Attorneys' Fee Act, 42 U.S.C. 1988, for the

11

legislative history, as this Court has recently discussed in

12

several cases, expressly refers to and incorporates or endorses

13

at least the Johnson factors.

14

By a curious logic, the Respondents have said that

15

they are entitled to more than $75.00 because they satisfied

16

the one special factor mentioned in the statute -- to wit, the

17

limited availability of qualified counsel.

18

is that there was a limited availability of attorneys that were

19

willing to serve in this case pro bono.

20

submitted any evidence, and the lower courts did not find, that

21

there was a limited availability of counsel at established

22

market rates or at $75.00 an hour.

But their argument

That, we submit, is the relevant question under EAJA,

that demonstrates that Respondents were entitled to fees, at

Despite this consecutive string of losses, the

Secretary argues that his position must have been substantially

which it should be punished, by entry of a fee award when it

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

What I am

29
1

saying is that the Government was engaging in a pattern of

2

litigation strategy that Congress has identified as a situation

3

that required a shifting of the cost of litigation from those

4

people who prevailed in court to the Government in the form of

5

an award of attorneys' fees.

6

I would like to point out on the issue of the

7

legislative history that mentioned the Dubose case, that the

8

existence of that Committee Report was not brought to the

9

attention of the Second Circuit.

Therefore, I think the split

10

between the Second Circuit and the Ninth Circuit on the

11

operating subsidy issue is possibly explainable simply son the

12

ground that more information on legislative history was brought

13

to the attention of the Ninth Circuit and it had a better basis

14

for reaching its conclusion.

15

QUESTION:

What if the Committee Report, Ms. Burdick,

16

had said, what if the statute said in so many words, Congress

17

directs the courts to award attorneys' fees to the prevailing

18

litigants in all of these particular cases?

19

would then have to go ahead and do that?

20

MS. BURDICK:

Do you think we

I think that would be very strong

21

evidence that that was Congress' intent that when the

22

Government persisted in litigating the way it did the operating

23

subsidy case, that fees were appropriate.

idea of the kind of cases it had in mind when it said if the

that the language was permissive rather than mandatory, and so

forth, in the statute, to determine whether that was reasonable

22

to litigate?

23

MS. BURDICK:

proper standard, which was not de novo but abuse of discretion.

13
14

Isn't that so?

QUESTION:

Well, what if it is really a question of

law?
MS. BURDICK:

It is not really a question of law.

16

Below in the District Court, when the nationwide injunction was

17

first sought, there was considerable evidence about the cost of

18

implementing the program, about the wisdom of the program, and

19

then there was analysis of the statute.

20
21
22

And the District Court Judge reached a conclusion
which was really a mix of law and fact.
QUESTION:

What is our standard of review if it is a

23

mixed question of law and fact?

24

MS. BURDICK:

25

I think the analysis has turned on what

are the practical implications of having a de novo review or

leaving the initial determination appropriately with the

2

District Court Judge, which was analyzed, I believe, fairly

3

well in the amicus brief of the Alliance for Justice, ACLU, and

4

I would join in the arguments that they made there on these

5

practical implications.

6

This Court, for example, has said repeatedly that

7

attorneys' fees litigation should be simplified and appeals on

8

attorneys' fees issues should be discouraged.

9

to the District Court's determinations on fee issues would

serve this policy.
Congress set forth some other factual patterns which

12

they said evidenced that the Government's position was not

13

substantially justified, in addition to persisting with

14

unsuccessful claims.

15

settled the case on terms which were extremely favorable to the

16

opposing party, evidencing that the Government recognized it

17

did not have a strong case.

18
19
20

One of those was whether the Government

In this case, the settlement gave to Plaintiffs every
penny they could have received in court.
QUESTION:

Wasn't that partly the nature of the case?

21

When Congress has appropriated a certain amount of money and

22

the Government says well, we don't have to contract for it, or

23

whatever the Government said here, you're not going to settle a

24

case like that, if the Congress has appropriated $60 million,

25

you are not going to settle it for $40 million.

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

I mean, if the

33

1

Government settles at all, aren't you just bound to get the

2

face amount

3

in that particular situation?

MS. BURDICK:

Not necessarily.

By the time we sat

4

down to talk about settlement, Congress had identified and

5

approved some other uses for the reserve fund.

6

been quite possible that we would have settled for a lesser

7

amount than was in the reserve fund for operating subsidies,

8

agreeing that the remaining amount could be used for new

9

subsidies created by Congress after the initial decision below.

10

It would have

Finally, Congress also said, through its Committee

11

Reports, that one way that you can see through an objective

12

indicator whether the Government's position was weak or strong

13

was whether the District Court below was able to resolve the

14

case on the merits easily.

15

In this case, we went in in a nationwide class action

16

and sought only a preliminary injunction for prospective

17

relief.

18

Government's case was without merit that, sua sponte, he

19

treated our motion as a motion for permanent injunction under

20

summary judgment, he issued a nationwide permanent injunction

21

and certified a nationwide action.

22

The District Court Judge was so persuaded that the

If prevailing parties are ever going to be entitled

23

to an

equal access award, on the ground that they opposed a

Government position which was not substantially justified, as

25

Congress understood those terms, this must be the case.

Heritage

Reporting Corporation

34
1

I would like to then, then, to how much we would be

2

entitled to.

The operative language here is "special factors."

3

In the statute, Congress gave one very concrete example of a

4

special factor which justifies an award in excess of $75.00 per

5

hour, and that is the limited availability of qualified

6

attorneys.

7

We introduced below uncontroverted evidence for the

8

commonsense proposition that there is an extremely small pool

9

of attorneys who will undertake nationwide class actions

10

against the Government on behalf of plaintiffs who will not be

11

paying on a fee for service basis, win or lose.

12
13
14

On this basis alone, the full award was affirm by the
Ninth Circuit and should be affirmed by this Court.
QUESTION:

Was part of the Ninth Circuit's or the

15

District Court's reliance on this the fact that it was a

16

lawsuit against the Government as opposed to somebody else?

17

MS. BURDICK:

I think the idea was that the suit was

18

against a party who could be expected to bring substantial

19

resources and who had already evidenced that they intended to

20

take the case as far as they could go on appeal.

21

QUESTION:

But that would be an argument in every

22

EAJA case, because all you get attorneys' fees from is the

23

Government.

24
25

MS. BURDICK:

But in the majority of EAJA cases, the

issue is simply disability payments.

Heritage

As many of the amici

that this was a case against the Government, but it was this

12

particular kind of case against the Government?

13

15

MS. BURDICK:

That's right.

You are correct.

Every

EAJA case is against the Government.
QUESTION:

Let me ask you a question there.

Does the

16

fact — in the first part of your argument, you are persuading

17

us that there really was no merit to the Government's case.

18

is pretty obvious that it was a weak case.

that is the kind of case a lawyer will be glad to grab on to

when there is a lot of money at the end of the line.

21

MS. BURDICK:

But it seems to me

Well, interestingly enough, no one

grabbed on to this case except our program.
QUESTION:

So you seem to be arguing in the second

part of your argument that it is really a tough case.

25

hard to find lawyers to handle this.

That still doesn't make it a hard case.

Your chance of losing you told us is practically nil.

6

MS. BURDICK:

What made it a hard case was the fact

that it evolved into a six-year settlement process which

required Plaintiff's counsel to undertake what the District

And for all that time, you are going to be paid.

12

MS. BURDICK:

The fact that we are going to be paid

The issue is who would have taken this

QUESTION:

21

MS. BURDICK:

Yes, the District Court did.

What do you think about that?
It is clear that Congress intended,

first of all, that there be other factors, having adopted the

language --

Well, how about these factors that the

District Court mentioned?

used were exactly what Congress had in mind.

10

And I think that

If the Government's case was so weak, how

can you get enhancement over $75.00 because it is so tough?
MS. BURDICK:

11

Because the case, by the time it ended,

12

after six years of settlement administration, proved to be

13

difficult, complex --

14

QUESTION:

That just means it was protracted.

15

MS. BURDICK:

It wasn't protracted.

The District

16

Court Judge said that it was difficult, during the six years

17

that he spent watching the case.

You mean there was a pretty good chance

you would lose, Plaintiffs would lose?
MS. BURDICK:

20

No, there was no chance we were going

do.

you can never get enhancement in EAJA cases, since the only

k

Heritage

Reporting Corporation

38
1

time you get fees at all is when the Government's case is not

2

substantially justified?

3

MS. BURDICK:

That is the logical extension of the

4

Government's argument, that if the Government is not

5

substantially justified, you necessarily are going to lose.

6

QUESTION:

There must be some cases in which even

7

though the Government is not substantially justified it is not

8

an easy case.

9
10
11
12

Right?

MS. BURDICK:
QUESTION:

Whether it is an easy case or not --

It doesn't make a lot of sense, but it has

to be, doesn't it?
MS. BURDICK:

Congress intended that there would be

13

cases where Plaintiff's counsel would be awarded more than

14

$75.00 per hour, because it expressly said, if there are

15

special factors, more shall be awarded.

16

I think this Court's analysis of legislative history

17

in Lorillard v. Ponds gives us our best analytic framework for

18

determining what Congress had in mind when it talked about

19

special factors.

20

This Court said in Lorillard that when Congress

21

re-enacts statutory language, we are to assume that Congress

22

intended to adopt judicial interpretation of the re-adopted

23

statutory language, absent some directive from Congress that it

24

had a different intention.

25

You said in Lorillard that this assumption is

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

39
1

especially strong when Congress evidences through the Committee

2

Reports an understanding of the evolving case law.
Re-adoption of the Equal Access to Justice Act is a

3
4

classic example of this legislative process of the re-adoption

5

of statutory langauge.

6

committees debated the Equal Access to Justice Act and they

7

reported on and reviewed in their Committee Reports more than

8

50 court decisions, criticizing more than 20 of those

9

decisions, all because they were too restrictive of fee awards.

For more than a year, the Congressional

The Committees did not criticize any of the then

10

11

existing precedents which allowed for award of more than $75.00

12

per hour, because of special factors.

13

at the time of the re-enactment of the Equal Access to Justice

14

Act were:

15

Circuit decision, and the Ninth Circuit affirmance in this very

16

case, Underwood.

17

The existing precedents

Action on Smoking and Health v. C.A.B., a D.C.

In Action on Smoking v. C.A.B., the D.C. Circuit said

18

that exceptional quality of representation, contingency and

19

delay could be special factors.

20

said exceptional quality of representation, exceptional success

21

complexity, difficulty, duration and again, contingency, could

22

be special factors.

23

The Ninth Circuit in this case

In addition, the Committees heard the testimony that

24

courts were awarding more than $75.00 per hour to attorneys who

25

provided extraordinary services in complex and protracted

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

40

1
2

cases.
Armed with this knowledge, Congress re-enacted the

3

words "special factors" without change and without comment.

4

Thus, we are compelled by a common-sense rule of statutory

5

construction to assume that when Congress re-adopted the words

6

"special factors," it understood those special factors to

7

include exceptional representation, exceptional success,

8

contingency, delay and difficulty of the case.

9

As the District Court Judge in the Ninth Circuit

10

recognized, this is a case raising every single one of those

11

special factors, as well as the one special factor which

12

Congress stated in the statute:-- limited availability of

13

qualified counsel.

counsel a list of all 4,000 housing projects where Plaintiff's

unable to turn over such a list, and we spent a year going

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS B. MERRILL, ESQUIRE

10

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

11

MR. MERRILL:

Let me first briefly address the three

12

factors that Respondents have relied on from the legislative

13

history in support of a finding that the Government was no

14

substantially justified in this case.
First is the string of District Court Opinions.

15

We

16

agree that in the proper case, where you have a subtle body of

17

authority, that would be something to be taken into account in

18

deciding whether or not the Government was substantially

19

justified.

20

District Court decisions that were, most of them, associated

21

with individual housing projects, all of them rendered in very

22

short order, one after the other, and the Government was

23

vigorously trying to appeal those decisions during the time

24

that the cases were being rendered.

25

i

The Court of Appeals

2

8

■v

That is right.

But in this case, what you had was a string of

The Government's choice, if it wanted to obtain

Reporting Corporation

\w

44
7

i

appellate review in this situation, was quite limited.

2

either could continue to fight the District Court actions until

3

they got appellate decision or I guess, as Respondents would

4

have it, we could just simply fold up and concede our case

5

before we got a decision on appeal.

6

strongly that appellate review was warranted and so incurred

7

the additional District Court defeats.

9

from the Bench as to how many final judgments there were

10

against the Secretary, except for the cases that were not

11

appealed on the District Court level, there were no final

12

judgments.

13

resulted in petitions for certiorari that were granted, and

14

before those cases were heard on the merits, the nationwide

15

class action was settled.

16

isolated District Court cases where the Government elected not

17

to appeal, there was no body of finally-determined law in

18

existence at the time this case was filed.

19

The two cases decided by the Court of Appeals both

And so in fact, other than some

With respect to the settlement, there are really two

20

key variables in understanding the settlement in this case,

21

and I think to illustrate why it is dangerous to treat a

22

settlement as an objective indicator of unreasonableness, first

23

of all, in 1977, Congress substantially amended the operating

24

subsidy statute.

25

f

The Secretary felt very

I should point out that in response to some questions

8

*\

They

First of all, it made the operating subsidy program

mandatory as to the future.

2

from 1974 to 1977, but it said starting in 1977, it is

3

mandatory in the future.

4

It did not address the situation

Secondly, Congress made it clear that the reserve

5

fund that had been accumulating — this was the source for the

6

$60 million -- could be spent without separate release of

7

contract authority

8

time had taken the position that she could not spend the

9

reserve fund without separate contract authority from Congress.

10

from Congress.

The Secretary up to that

So in light of that clarification of the law, there

11

was no legal impediment to distributing the $60 million at that

12

point in time, there was no real dispute on an ongoing basis

13

about the policy because that had been resolved by Congress,

14

and it made sense to settle the case.

*>
15

r

Secondly, following up on the elections of 1976,

16

there was a new Secretary of HUD.

And it is reasonable to

17

conclude that policy differences had a great deal to do with

18

the decision to settle the case here.

19

Regarding the District Court's ruling sua sponte in

20

favor of the Plaintiffs, what happened was there was a motion

21

for preliminary injunction that was fully briefed and argued,

22

and after the Judge decided to enter a preliminary injunction,

23

the Judge decided there would be no point in hearing additional

24

argument on a permanent injunction and so entered a permanent

25

injunction without further argument.

Heritage

Reporting Corporation

46

1

Given that the issues involved were strictly legal,

2

we don't think this sheds any light one way or another on the

3

weightiness of the Government's argument.

4

Turning to the debate about attorneys' fees, and

5

whether or not counsel are entitled to enhanced fees either

6

because of the one special factor identified by Congress or

7

because of the Johnson factors, several points.
First of all, there is no evidence in this case, as

8
9

Respondent suggests, that there is a limited supply of

10

attorneys who would have taken this case on a win or lose

11

basis.

12

limited supply of counsel who would take the case on a pro bono

13

basis, and that we submit is simply not the relevant question

14

under EAJA.

The evidence that was submitted was that there was a

QUESTION:

But isn't the fact that there are no pro

22

23

reguirement?

24
25

MR. MERRILL:

We don't think so, Justice Stevens.

The statute basically is addressed to the situation where an

Heritage

Reporting Corporation

47
1

attorney has been hired for $85.00 or $100.00 an hour and the

2

statutory cap is $75.00 an hour.

3

not that additional fee was necessary in order to attract

4

counsel in this particular case.

5

And the issue is whether or

In this case, you had counsel hired basically for

6

nothing, and the issue is whether or not we think $75.00 is an

7

adequate fee in that case, not whether or not you would

leapfrog above $75.00.
