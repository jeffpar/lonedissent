CHIEF JUSTICE RHENQUIST:

Mr. Buchwald, you may

proceed whenever you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. DON D. BUCHWALD

5

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. BUCHWALD:

6

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

7

the Court.

8

Foster Winans and his two co-defendants, should be reversed

9

because what these defendants did is not securities fraud and

10

11

The convictions of Wall Street Journal reporter

it is not mail, or wire fraud.
By way of overview with respect to the securities

12

laws first, there are two principal reasons that we have as to

13

why the securities fraud conviction should be reversed.

14

First, that securities fraud can only be committed on

15

investors or persons who participate in securities

16

transactions.

17

newspaper or upon a private employer who has not participated

18

in the securities transaction and who has no interest in the

19

purchase, sale, or value of the securities involved.

20

It is not something that can be committed upon a

And second, that a private company work rule, such as

21

the Wall Street Journal's does not have the force of criminal

22

law, particularly whereas here it is presented to employees as

23

going beyond the requirements of the law.

24
25

This case involves a private wrong by Foster Wynans
upon the Wall Street Journal which, if it became public, could

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

adversely affect the newspaper's reputation.

2

wrong, we submit, however one may view it,

3

was intended to be covered by the securities laws, even if the

4

wrong is cast in terms of the misappropriation of information.

This kind of

is simply not what

The securities laws were designed to protect market

5

6

participants from fraud, and not employers form potential

7

damage to their reputations.

8

statutes protect persons from fraud in their capacities as

9

property holders, the laws proscribing securities fraud protect

Just as the mail and wire fraud

10

persons from fraud in their capacity as investors or

11

participants in market transactions.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Buchwald, can I ask you a question

13

right there?

14

Would that amount to a — would there have been a

21

MR.

22

QUESTION:

BUCHWALD:

There would not, Your Honor.

In that you could reasonably conclude that

23

there was some injury to market participants as a result of

24

this?

25

MR. BUCHWALD:

Heritage

We would submit that that would not

4
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

suffice, that there must be fraud upon the market participants.

2

Here, Justice Stevens, what we have as Foster1Winans'

3

trading on what he perceives will likely be the market impact

4

of the accurate articles that he is writing and that, we

5

submit, is no different than a situation where Salomon Bros,

6

may trade knowing that their very well-known economist partner,

7

Murray Kaufman is going to be making a speech in the afternoon,

8

in which he gives his opinion that interest rates are going

9

down, and Salomon Bros., in anticipation of the market impact

10
11

of that speech, buys into sensitive stocks in the morning.
QUESTION:

But in the short answer, you are saying

12

that, taking these facts, even if they had alleged and proved

13

adverse market impact as a result of the fraud, that would

14

still not be a violation because — because what?

15

MR. BUCHWALD:

Because a market participant must be

16

defrauded in that capacity as a market participant, and that

17

that is the reach of the securities laws.

18

that there simply be a fraud, assuming that Winans' conduct

19

here vis-a-vis the Wall Street Journal is a fraud, which is a

20

premise we dispute.

21

upon a third party, which who himself, has no interest in the

22

purchase, sale or value of securities and is not participating

23

in a securities transaction; and then that fraud somehow

24

relates or impacts upon —

25

QUESTION:

It is not sufficient

It is not sufficient that there be a fraud

But why is this any less of a fraud on the

Heritage

5
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

market participants than if the information that gave him an

2

advantage in trading was corporate information instead of

3

information about the timing of his columns?

4

MR. BUCKWALD:

It would still not be a fraud on the

5

market participants unless there was a pre-existing

6

relationship between Mr. Winans in this case and the people

7

selling him the stock that he buys in advance of the column,

8

which gave rise to a duty to disclose that information.

9

10
11

QUESTION:

But you never have that on a trade on the

open market.
MR. BUCHWALD:

Well, in the cosmic sense, that I

12

think that the securities laws presume in the discloser's

13

staying — obligation exists even when you have open market

14

transactions.

15

where you have a pre-existing relationship to the corporation

16

whose.securities are being traded; there, as in essence, say a

17

fiduciary or trustee of the corporation's information, the

18

securities laws presume that you are a trustee or fiduciary of

19

the information of all of the shareholders.

20

And the existence of that relationship occurs

QUESTION:

What if the insider uses inside

21

information that pertains not to his own corporation but to

22

another corporation that this corporation somehow, somehow

23

happens to have acquired?

24

of that other corporation — you would say that that would not

25

be within the securities laws either?

And he uses that to purchase shares

6

Heritage

Corporation

628-4888

MR. BUCHWALD:

1

That that would not be in the

2

securities laws because there is no — that is really the

3

situation of Tiorello, where you have information that emanates

4

from the acquiring company side, and you then use that

5

information in the — to buy stock of the company to be

6

purchased — the target company.

7

And while that Tiorello kind of situation is how

8

covered by Rule 14e-3, the 10b analysis, it would not apply

9

because there is no pre-existing relationship that gives rise

10

to the duty to disclose.

three main reasons that we have on the mail and wire fraud

side.

policy, is not a criminal fraud.

14

QUESTION:

But the cases have been pretty generous in

15

looking at different schemes or artifices, as sufficing for

16

purposes of a fraud.

17

MR. BUCHWALD:

I think that they have — that there

18

has been, certainly pre-McNally, Your Honor, a tendency 'to be

19

very expansive in the view of what is fraud, and that many

20

cases in the Circuits have suggested that whenever one violates

21

a rule of one's employer, there is potential mail or: wire fraud

22

exposure.

4

23

QUESTION:

24

You think there is no fraud?

25

But you said there were three reasons.
We might disagree on that.

Now, what is the next reason?

MR. BUCHWALD:

Our position is that, the kind of
I

2

injury which is asserted here, namely a putative reputational

3

injury, is not the kind of injury that is cognizable under the

4

mail or wire fraud statutes.

5

QUESTION:

Well, it is more than that.

It is^

6

"reputation" with an economic effect.

7

our cases have dealt with it in such a way such as to indicate

8

that could not be enough.

9

MR. BUCHWALD:

I do not think any of

But the suggestion, the process -- the

10

district court held not that there was, in fact, reputational

11

harm here; not that Winans intended reputational harm, but that

12

because he could contemplate that, if his unethical conduct was

13

discovered and became public, though that was not his aim,

14

obviously; that that could cause diminished reputation of the

15

employer and that, in turn, could have economic impact on the

16

Wall Street Journal.

17

QUESTION:

Do you not think that the employer, that

18

the Wall Street Journal had maybe a property right in its

19

publication schedule?

20

Is that not a sort of a business secret?

MR. BUCHWALD:

Well, the short answer, Justice White,

21

is I think that there can be a property interest in the

22

publication schedule, but the question is, in what way are they

23

deprived of that property interest by Foster Winans' conduct?

24

They — when I use —

25

QUESTION:

Well, it was certainly no longer a secret

that they, if they —
MR. BUCHWALD:
QUESTION:

But, if Foster Winans, for example —

— have not been deprived, if they were

trying to keep that secret and it is suddenly given out to a
limited number of people, it is no longer a secret.
MR. BUCHWALD:

But the fact of secrecy has no

independent value, we submit, except vis-a-vis, competitors.
If Foster Winans were to have told his mother about the
interesting article that he had written that was going to
appear on Monday's newspaper, thought that would be a violation
of the Wall Street Journal policy, it does not hurt.

There is

no economic impact.
QUESTION:
is suddenly gone.

Whatever property interest the paper has
So you are really saying there are really no

property interest that needs to be considered?
MR. BUCHWALD:

What we are saying is, the only way

that a property interest can be said to exist is in the
exclusive use of the knowledge, and that that is a meaningful
interest only vis-a-vis competitors.
QUESTION:

Mr. Buchwald, why is that so?

I assume

that, I assume that one reason the Wall Street Journal is
purchased by a lot of people is that they read articles such as
this one about a company that may contain public information,
but it brings it all together and I say,

"gee, if I read that

article and purchase that stock right away, I will get a rise

10
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

of 30 points," let us say.

2

[Mirth.]

3

To the extent that Mr. Winans, or anybody else, leaks

4

in advance the fact that this article is coining out, or using

5

his, the knowledge that the article is coining out, to make a

6

profit, the rise will not be 30 points; it will be 29 1/2

7

points.

8

not something of value to the Wall Street Journal?

I mean, he milked some of that rise.

Now, why is that

Indeed, why would hot the Wall Street Journal itself

9
10

trade on the knowledge that it is coming out with an article?

11

The only explanation I have is that it knows that, if it traded

12

on that, the jump would not be as much and its articles would

13

not be as — have as much of an impression.

14

would not sell as many newspapers.

15

something of value that he has taken away?

17

MR. BUCHWALD:

And therefore they

Now why is that not
The half-point

The Journal itself, and very

18

specifically, and at trial, through its testimony, disclaimed

19

any intention of giving market advice to its readers, or to

20

recommending or suggesting they buy or sell stocks.

21

QUESTION:

People just read it from general interest?

22

[Mirth.]

23

MR. BUCHWALD:

It does not seem to me that the

24

Journal could claim to be defrauded with respect to a function

25

which it specifically denies that it has.

Estoppel?

Is that why this theory cannot be used?

MR. BUCHWALD:

4

This theory could not be used because

5

it is not charged at all.

8

itself, therefore, has a property interest in, is in the

9

supplemental post-McNally brief.

below.

They were — the first time there is

That argument was never made

'

•• ' :

Your Honors, if I might return to the — well, let me
follow up the argument about reputation while we are here.

It

i

13

seems to me, if you can follow a process of "my ethical breach,

14

which is not itself illegal conduct, but my ethical breach, if

15

it is discovered, can cause reputational damage to my employer

16

— that might have economic fallout; therefore I am guilty of a

17

federal mail and wire fraud, assuming the requisite mailings

18

and wires."

19

What you have done, essentially, is elevated' every

20

employee ethical breach into a federal crime.

21

federal prosecutors a vehicle, even though you start'with

22

conduct that is not illegal, for establishing a process, if it

23

is discovered — though that is not intended, if the public

24

therefore thinks less of your employer, though there is no

25

finding that that occurred here, and indeed, every indication

Heritage

You have given

12
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

is that it did not occur here — and if that reputational

2

damage can translate somehow into economic harm.

3

So all ethical breaches by employees are elevated to

4

the status of federal crimes, and we submit that quite hside

5

from trivializing the criminal law as that would do, and quite

6

aside from federalizing the rules pertaining to employee

7

ethical breaches, and quite aside from the enormous disctetion

8

that this places in the hands of prosecutors, that there are

9

three additional reasons on the facts of this case why that

10

putative reputational damage cannot translate into the kind of

11

economic injury which McNally requires the schemers aim for.

12

Number one is, that on the facts of this case, and

13

the testimony is undisputed, the Wall Street Journal had never

14

made known its policy to the readers or to the public prior to

15

the events of this case.

16

newspaper, and never appeared in any public filing of the Wall

17

Street Journal's — and therefore reliance by members of the

18

public on the existence of the policy or on adherence to the

19

policy, had never been invited.

20

That it never appeared in the

The second reason is that the Court — this Court has

21

held in construing the term, "property," within Paul v. Davis,

22

in the context of state deprivation of property without,due

23

process of law, that property does not include reputation.

24

with respect to interpreting the 1868 civil rights amendment,

25

the 14th Amendment, ’it seems to me that the relatively

And

1

2

assume that Congress —
QUESTION:

3

Well, I think that in Paul v. Davis, the

4

Court really just said that reputation alone, apart from some

5

more tangible interest, such as employment, or so forth, would

6

not.

7

is warranted.

So I think you are reading a lot more into that case than

MR. BUCHWALD:

8

Justice O'Connor, the think about

9

reputation, and the facts there, it were the case that,:because

10

the plaintiff there had been defamed and called a "pickpocket,"

11

and therefore it was less likely that he would be employed by

12

the bank as a teller, or less likely that he would get any one

13

of a number of employment opportunities, the damage to

14

reputation could only, as a theoretical level, as a putative

15

injury concept, be stretched out to mean "potential economic

16

harm."

17

1

' '.■

So it seems to us that, while I think Your Honor is

18

quite correct, that Paul v. Davis simply went off on a'

19

"reputation" concept, reputation, the value of my name, the

20

value of reputation, is the way it translates economically.

21

QUESTION:

Congress could, in the mail fraud statute,

22

define "property" more broadly than we said it was defined by

23

the Constitution in Paul v. Davis, could it not?

24
25

MR. BUCHWALD:

I think that is clearly the case.

We

do not mean to suggest that, because of the interpretation in

Heritage

14
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

one, but the relatively contemporaneous nature of the statute

2
3

QUESTION:

But you say it has not done so yet?

4

MR. BUCHWALD:

That is correct, Your Honor.

And we

5

believe that it would be unwise to do so for the very reason

6

that we have here, that you elevate an ethical breach into a

7

federal crime if the ethical breach, if discovered, could cause

8

reputational injury.

9

QUESTION:

But your argument is only partly that it

10

would be "unwise," I take it.

11

against constructive crimes.

12

MR. BUCHWALD:

Your argument is basically

That is correct, Your Honor.

That is

13

correct, Your Honor.

14

things that we believe are wrong with using reputational damage

15

as the fulcrum for mail and wire fraud injury, the third reason

16

that we would give here, is that there is simply no intent by

17

these Petitioners to deprive the Wall Street Journal of its

18

reputation.

Turning, if I might, back to the mail and wire fraud

6

■— well, let me just address one other point with respect to

7

the mail and wire fraud statute, and then turn to the

8

securities law:

9

reversal of the mail and wire fraud convictions, that the

we have also argued as a third grounds for

10

mailings and wirings here, what is alleged is that the printing

11

of the Wall Street Journal articles, and that the mailings of

12

the Wall Street Journal to subscribers the following day were

13

"wires and mails" caused for the purpose for this scheme to

14

deprive the Wall Street Journal of property.

15

And if one focuses on the publication schedule, or

16

the exclusive use of the publication schedule is that which is

17

deprived, even in this context of it not going to a competitor,

18

of it not going to the New York Times, as the property that is

19

deprived, on the facts here, that all occurs on the day

20

preceding publication of the article, when there is a leak in

21

the information, when the initial purchase of stock in

22

anticipation of the article, occurs.

23

!

So if that is a cognizable property deprivation, it

24

is something which has fully occurred before the wires, before

25

the mailings, of the Wall Street Journal, and in no sense can

Heritage

16
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

those wires or mailings be said to be caused for the purpose of

2

executing the scheme to defraud.
There is.no fraud alleged here nor, in fact, was

investors.

enable, may cause to exist, that process by which Winans

7

believes he is going to be successful in the stock market, that

8

is not the cognizable fraud that is alleged on the Wall Street

9

Journal in the mail and wire fraud counts.

And therefore,

10

these mailings and wires, if that language,

"cause for the

11

purpose of executing," has any meaning, are not sufficient

12

here.

And so even though that subsequent publication may

15

participants in market transactions, how investors be

16

defrauded, follows from the language of the statute, for which

17

the misappropriation theory is not a substitute.

18

each case where the government alleges that misappropriation

19

has occurred, look to the particular conduct which the

20

government asserts constitutes that misappropriation,' and.then

21

determine if that conduct constitutes "a manipulative or

22

deceptive device or contrivance employed in connection with the

23

purchase or sale of securities," as Section 10b requites, and

24

is it a fraud, as Rule 10b-5 requires?

we believe that the requirement of fraud that the

meaning.

A "manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance"

2

prescribes conduct directed at investors.

3

investors, either indirectly through manipulations, watched

sales, matched orders, things aimed at the market as a whole,

5

but designed to affect individual investor conduct, or the

"hoodwinking of investors directly through deceptions,

falsehoods, half-truths, or silence, where there is a duty to

that there is a "requirement of disclosure with respect to

That, in essence, is what happened here.

matter of internal policy, policy which the Wall Street Journal

made up on pain of firing those who do not follow the policy,

that by adopting that rule, the government claims that

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

You are speaking now to the mail fraud

In fact, in that respect, I speak to both

a footnote in our Supplemental Brief, made the point very well.

2

THe information was the property of the Wall Street Journal.

If somebody takes my car, Justice Scalia, and returns it with a

full tank of gas and no dents, it is not okay for them to say,

5

"oh, nothing happened."

True, they did not intend to get caught, and they did not get

caught until they brought the car back.

MR. FRIED:

In fact, I would differ there.

I think

there is considerable symmetry between the mechanism of
benefit, I would say, Justice Scalia, on one hand, and the
mechanism of the potential harm on the other:

the mechanism of

benefit to Winans and his confederates is that people believe
in this column and do not imagine that, in fact, all !this stuff
has been traded upon and it is just to be discounted.
If it were not for that conviction — your questions
to Mr. Buchwald earlier pointed that out — if it were not for
that conviction on the part of the readers, the fraild would not
have its effect.

So the reputation is there on both sides.

is the very thing that the Wall Street Journal is selling its
newspapers on, on one hand.
Now, that is not very much money on any particular
day, but over the years it mounts up.

That is the very thing

the Journal is selling its newspapers on on the one hand, and
it is the very thing which Winans and his confederates are
profiting from on the other.

So I think that there is quite

And

What precisely

is "that?"
MR. FRIED:

14

some good luck, we think," and the fact that that column was

15

going to appear on Wednesday, "that fact" is what they

misappropriated.

That fact was entrusted to them.

QUESTION:

MR. FRIED:

misappropriated is the information as to the timing and content

20

of the column.

And you certainly can —

QUESTION:

And it was a confidential information

which was then used by them in their scheme?
MR. FRIED:

Precisely.

This Court, every Member of

this Court recognized the nature of confidential information in

25

an employment relation in the Snep case, where the Court said

Heritage

24
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

that,

"even in the absence of a written contract, an employee

2

has the fiduciary obligation to protect confidential 1

3

information obtained during the course of his employment."

4

That is the duty which he breached.

5

QUESTION:

MR. FRIED:

That precisely is the --

Now, does McNally bear on this problem?
I think McNally is wholly irrelevant to

7

this case.

Because McNally addressed a concern that the

8

government was federalizing breaches which deprived —

9

employers of the faithful service of their employees,; and even

10

more troublesome, breaches which somehow deprived state and

11

local governments of good government and the faithful service

12

of public service.

13

this case, the breach of loyalty, the same breach that the

14

Court noticed in the Snep case, is the instrument, not the end,

15

of the crime.

17

That is not the issue in this case.

21

that duty of confidentiality is the very duty which Wihans

22

breached in this case.

23

QUESTION:

And

Yes, but if Congress wanted to say in so

24

many words, "no person shall breach a duty of confidentiality

to their employer" in these circumstances, the case would give

1

one little trouble.

But Congress has spoken in very general

2

terms and it seems to me you are kind of putting layers on the

3

thing.
MR. FRIED:

4

I hope not, because in speaking of fraud,

5

Congress necessarily assumed the ordinary common law meaning of

6

fraud.

7

crimes, on the shoulders, as it were, of pre-existing relations

This Court in

Ruckleshouse v. Monsanto recognized trade secrets as property

difficulty in treating confidential information as a ispecies of

MR. FRIED:

be a kind-of interest that was protected by the mail and wire

afield as that particular case would have got.

QUESTION:

2

General Fried, I am a little troubled

3

because, are you claiming that the obtaining of this property,

4

namely the information, was done by fraud?
MR. FRIED:

5

The fraud, the information was

6

misappropriated at the time either that Winans himself traded

7

on it, as he did I think on at least one occasion, or when he

8

communicated it to his confederates for the purpose of trading

9

on it.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

No, it was misused, as you say, but the

acquisition of the information was not obtained by fraiid?
MR. FRIED:

No.

If you want a common law equivalent,

13

we would say, "this property indeed was stolen, but the form of

14

theft was embezzlement rather than larceny by trick or false

15

pretenses."

16

QUESTION:

I am not contending the information was,

17

there was nothing dishonest about his finding out when the

38

column was going to be published, was there?

19

MR. FRIED:

No.

The initial acquisition of the

20

information, at least at the outset of the scheme, he may have

21

been entirely honest; it is the subsequent use of the

22

information which had been entrusted to him, just like any

23

other servant who is entrusted with property and who, perhaps,

24

receives that property in quite good faith, but subsequently

25

misappropriates it, is guilty of embezzlement.

7

you say the harm is the injury to the reputation?

MR. FRIED:

9

QUESTION:

That is correct.
But yet you are saying it is different

10

from the intangible right to honest and good government

11

somehow, the intangible right to honest and good reporting, is

12

different in intent.

13

implications when you focus on this intangible interest in good

14

reputation.
MR. FRIED:

15

I am worried about the McNally

;

Well, I see this as very different from

16

those concerns in McNally because what was the object of the

17

fraud here was the confidential information, which does:seem to

18

be a familiar, though intangible, form of property.
QUESTION:

19
20

But it is also an element to deprive the

Wall Street Journal of its good reputation and so-forth.
MR. FRIED:

21

The harm of its — the reputation is the

22

harm.

23

which the Wall Street Journal suffers, or which is at least put

24

at-risk.

25

It is not the property.

The reputation is the harm

There is no need to show that it suffered harm.
QUESTION:

But you do agree that some kind of harm of

Heritage

29
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

that nature beyond the acquisition of the property is an

2

essential ingredient of the offense?

4

of Foster Winans telling his mother about this information just

5

because he is a gossip.
QUESTION:

Yes, it is an essential element of the

defense.
MR. FRIED:

is contemplated or risked.

actually eventuate.

11

QUESTION:

I do not think that it has to

If that is true, why is this "harm,'1 which

12

I would call some sort of an intangible harm, why is that

13

different than the "harm" in McNally?

14

MR. FRIED:

Because in McNally, what was lacking,

15

what was utterly lacking, was the depriving of anything like

16

the property which in this case we have I would say we have in

17

sufficient degree.

18

the only question is, "how does depriving the Wall Street

19

journal of this property harm it?"

So we have the taking of the property and

20

If somebody takes your car, Justice Stevens, and it

21

is up in the country, and you do not know about it, they have

22

taken your property and then there is a further question, "what

23

harm has it done you?"

24
25

QUESTION:

Those are two separate questions.

I understand that, but I suppose in a

sense, one could say in McNally there was a property interest

30

in controlling the placement of insurance and they acquired

2

that without violating any laws by exercising their authority.

think we urged that on the Court — unsuccessfully.

6

One might have said that, indeed.

, .

But I think that we had, and we did not prevail, in

part because the interest in being able to direct where

property, while confidential information is an entirely

familiar species of information.

I must say that the concept of putting

is so because the way in which the securities law makes sure

3

that the fraud is securities-related, securities-focused, if

4

you wish, is by the provision that the fraud which the rule

says can be committed on any person — not a market participant

— by any person, must be in connection with the purchase and

In the absence of such a work rule, for

have been given the context of the relationship that there

existed, there would have been no understanding, no mutual

19

understanding, that this kind of action is a breach of‘trust.

20

The work rule does not have to be spelled out in order to make

21

it plain that a particular course of conduct is an act Of

22

disloyalty or is not an act of disloyalty.

37
Reporting Corporation

of a similar work rule, but if there is an understanding that

2

that is the nature of the relation, that is quite sufficient.
Now, I would like to address briefly the question

3
4

about what the securities laws are directed against, because

5

Petitioners say they are "directed against protection from

6

fraud of those persons who are trading in this particular

7

case."

8
9

• '
What the statute says is that, "in general, the

securities laws are directed at procuring or assuring honest

10

securities markets."

And in specific, they say via I0b-5,

11

"fraud against any person in connection."

12

Now, in this case, it seems to me that what has been

13

done is not at all a parody of information theory, not at all.

14

Because, what we are saying is that,

15

be on the lookout for trading against people who are Smarter

16

than you are, luckier than you are: better informed than you

17

are — but not against people who have stolen the information

18

which they are trading on."

19

encourages what I would call a "cascading deterioration" of the

20

honesty of the securities markets of the sort which the'charge,

21

at least in Chiarella, did not.

not depriving the other person of that information either
permanently, temporarily, or partially.
And the cutoff point, it seems to us, as to where
information takes on some kind of property value in anything
even remotely resembling a McNally sense, is either when you
use the information in competition with your employer, or where
you are giving the information to a competitor to use in
competition; in essence in a "trade secret" sense.
With respect to General Fried's suggestion that, the
"in connection with" requirement is satisfied if the scheme is
for the purpose of buying or selling stocks, in addition to the
example which Justice White gave, the example of obtaining
information from a prominent investment advisor, if I join the
Joe Granville hotline with a bounced check and no intention
actually of paying Mr. Granville for his advice and I then get
a telegram in return for my $1000 bounced check, saying that he
recommends XYZ company and then I now go out and buy the stock
in XYZ, under the government's theory, that would be a
securities fraud, because it is for the purpose of trading in
securities.
And essentially, because the government wishes to
move away from these examples of the embezzlement, and the use
of information fraudulently obtained from an investment
advisor, they place a limiting principle of fairness on the
market, which we believe cannot be found on the market, which
