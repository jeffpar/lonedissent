ORAL ARGUMENT OF JIM R. BRUCE, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF DEFENDANT
MR. BRUCE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case concerns the location of Mississippi's

10
11

coast line and the extent of its seaward boundaries.

12

the course of my argument, I'll be referring to charts which

13

were included in the amicus brief of the State of Alaska, as

14

well as Figure No. 2 included in the Report of the Special

15

Master.

16

During

Now, in the previous proceeding before this Court, we

17

were all focusing on the question of whether Mississippi Sound

18

constituted inland waters.

19

Court agreed that it was inland waters and directed the Master

20

to frame an appropriate decree.

21

We presented our case and this

In approaching that task, the Master was faced with a

22

problem a-s he approached the western end of Mississippi Sound

23

in the area where Mississippi Sound meets the waters of

24

Chandeleur Sound south.

25

that a corner had to be drawn somewhere closing both of these

The Master however felt constrained not to deal with

2

an issue which appeared to be obvious in light of the Court's

3

previous opinion, that is, necessary and obvious for

4

establishing a coast line.

5

Now, the Solicitor General's argument is confusing as

6

to whether or not he is suggesting remand or that this case is

7

at an end and that no further proceeding should be taken.

8

says this is a case about Mississippi Sound only, and that it

should be reserved for a supplemental decree.

He

What we're asking the Court to do today is to remand

11

this case with instructions to the Master so that he can deal

12

with the coastline question in a logical manner and not feel

13

foreclosed from recommending a proper decree in the case.

14

that's the Solicitor General's position, too, then we're all

15

agreed on remand and there's no issue for this Court to decide.

The only issue in this case is Mississippi

Sound, or not?
MR. BRUCE:

7

No, Your Honor.

Basically that was

8

disposed of at our last proceeding before this Court.

9

question now is where the coastline should be located, that is,

10

should it take into consideration the inland waters of

11

Chandeleur Sound as well.
QUESTION:

12
13
14

The

Well, why does Chandeleur Sound come into

the case?
MR. BRUCE:

Well, because the Master in his report

15

was attempting to delineate the coastline of Mississippi.

16

order to delineate the coastline of Mississippi, you have to

17

determine the limits of inland waters.

He felt that he was foreclosed by this

Court's previous opinion.
QUESTION:

You have to address our opinion, then.

Before Chandeleur Sound is involved, you have to convince us

the Master was wrong in construing our remand.

Isn't that right?
I would agree, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

1
2

Well, tell me why the Master was wrong in

that regard.
MR. BRUCE:

3

Well, I think first of all in the

4

opinion, the Court noted that this was a very narrow question

5

involving only Mississippi Sound, or at least that's the way I

6

read the very beginning of this opinion.

7

agreed that Chandeleur Sound was inland waters.

8

United States has offered a concession to a part of Chandeleur

9

Sound.

11

Which he rejected, which Mississippi

rejected?
MR. BRUCE:

12

13

The parties were much

Yes, Your Honor, because we felt that the

offer was less than what we were entitled to —

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. BRUCE:

It's amazing, isn't it.
— as a matter of law.

And of course the

16

question as to the status of Chandeleur Sound was raised before

17

the previous Master and was presented to this Court in the

18

claim of a straight base line.

19

QUESTION:

20

Well, in this proceeding when did the

State first raise the Chandeleur Sound issue?

21

MR. BRUCE:

Your Honor, that would have been back, I

22

believe, in early 1983, prior to the time the Master had

23

submitted his previous recommendation.

24

notes on page 24 of his opinion in his footnote that

25

Mississippi did raise the question of the status of Chandeleur
Sound.

In fact, the Master

In addition, we believe that there are other opinions
6

Heritage

of this Court which have recognized Chandeleur Sound as inland

2

waters.
If you go back to the 1906 decision of Louisiana v.

3
4

Mississippi, the question there was the boundary between the

5

State of Mississippi and the State of Louisiana.

6

that regard, it's interesting to look at what the parties were

7

claiming and specifically what the Court said about Chandeleur

8

Sound.

I think in

In that case, of course, the State of Louisiana asked

that the Gulf of Mexico began eastward the the Chandeleur

of the issues for the Court to consider in deciding whether to

Yes, Your Honor.

21

the Special Master's report and of course this statement from

22

Louisiana v. Mississippi is an early legal precedent we believe

23

that shows that he is wrong.
The Court in its final decree in that case

24
25

interestingly enough attached a map and made it a part of the
decree.

And if you look at that map, you'll find that the

boundary line which the Court delineated runs into Chandeleur

2

Sound.

3

Chandeleur Sound was not shown.

*

In fact, it runs off the paper, because all of

In addition, the Court commenting on what Louisiana

4
5

had argued made it very clear as to where Chandeleur Sound

6

began and ended and where the Gulf of Mexico began and ended.

7

The Court said, to get into the open water of the Gulf of

8

Mexico beyond Chandeleur Islands and around to the western

9

boundary of Louisiana, it is necessary to follow, as Louisiana

10

contends, the deep water channel through Mississippi Sound, and

11

thence by the pass between Cat Island and Isle Au Pitre north

12

of the Chandeleur Islands into the Gulf of Mexico.
Now, I think it would be very difficult to read that

MR. BRUCE:

I think that could be an argument that

2

would be made to oppose this.

3

the Court was the location of the boundary between Mississippi

4

and Louisiana, and of course the Court fond that the boundary

5

of Louisiana went all the way to the Gulf of Mexico.

6

order to resolve that, the Court would have had to have decided

7

where the Gulf of Mexico began.

However, the issue presented to

So in

So I think it could be argued that way, but I would
think that it was material to the determination of the issue
and it was the lateral boundary between the two States.
One of the other problems that we find with the

12

Master's report, and that is that the recommendation if

13

accepted would divest Mississippi of approximately 150 square

14

miles of territory which the United States has been recognizing

for the most part of this century.

So this Court has been

3

v. Mississippi, the whole decree seems to be premised upon the

4

fact that there is a lateral boundary between Mississippi and

5

Louisiana.

6

there is no lateral boundary, and that the decree lacks

7

definiteness and creates a real problem.

If Chandeleur Sound is not inland waters, I submit

QUESTION:

8
9

And of course, in the 1981 final decree in Louisiana

Mr. Bruce, let me ask you a question if I

may about the map which I think is the one in Alaska's Amicus

1

Brief.

It seems odd in a way that we should be relying on a

11

map which is found only in the Amicus Brief.

12

MR. BRUCE:

13

QUESTION:

Especially from Alaska.
But take a look at where it shows

14

Chandeleur Sound, and then on the left all that land, is that

15

mainland Louisiana?

16

MR. BRUCE:

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

And that was

17

decided of course in Louisiana v. Mississippi in 19 6 as well

18

and the Court held that was the mainland of Louisiana.

Pitre is the furthest extension of the Louisiana mainland.

In addition to those problems, we feel

that the Master confused the terms, boundary and coastline.

deprived Mississippi of the claims of Chandeleur Sound inland

That's correct.
But you would close Chandeleur Sound from

the south end of the Chandeleur Islands over to the Delta?

Down over to 1.

Yes, Your Honor.
And then Chandeleur Sound is divided

between Mississippi and Louisiana?
MR. BRUCE:

The northern part of it would be, yes,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

And what about the southern part of

Chandeleur Sound, is that all Mississippi?
MR. BRUCE:

No, Your Honor, that wouldn't be.

The

southern part of Chandeleur Sound and Breton Sounds which have

what the status of that water is?

It appears from what the Master said that

10

he was fixing our boundary as that term is used and the term

could go.

And he makes the coastline go between the islands.

QUESTION:

14

MR. BRUCE:

I understand.

15

so that leaves a long finger of land in there which we estimate

to be somewhere around 150 square miles that would be lost to

QUESTION:

The Master rejected that and you did not
