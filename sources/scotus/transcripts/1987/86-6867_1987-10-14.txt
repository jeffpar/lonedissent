CHIEF JUSTICE REHNOUIST:

Mr. Klingsberg, you may

proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID KLINGSBERG, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KLINGSBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, this is an appeal on writ of certiorari
limited to two issues as to which the Court of Appeals for

10

the Fifth Circuit with one dissent denied petitioner's

11

application for writ of habeas corpus to set aside the death

12

sentence imposed upon him.

13

Petitioner was convicted of three counts of first

14

degree murder, and with the Court's permission I propose to

15

begin with the facts and the legal argument relating to the

16

first issue, which concerns coercive procedures threatening

17

the impartiality of the jury during the sentencing phase and

18

then move later to the facts and legal argument on the second

19

point, which is premised on the absence of a meaningful

20

finding of at least one valid statutory aggravating circum­

21

stance at the sentencing phase.

22

During the sentencing phase on the second day of

23

deliberations after about nine hours a note came from the

24

jury indicating that the jurors were in great distress, there

25

was a great unbalance in the voting, and that the jurors were

1

unable to reach a decision at this point.

The Court then

2

undertook a procedure whereby each juror was asked to put his

3

name on a piece of paper indicating yes or no as to whether

4

further deliberations would be helpful in obtaining a verdict.

5

Four jurors indicated no.
The jurors then indicated that some had misunderstood

6

7

the question and the procedure was repeated, changing the

8

language to whether further deliberations will enable the

9

jurors to reach a verdict.

10

whittled down to one juror.

At that point the no votes were

Finally, the Court delivered a modified Allen

11

12

charge, telling the jurors when they enter the jury room it

13

is their duty to discuss the evidence with the objective of

14

reaching a just verdict.

15

55 minutes after that, the jurors came in with a unanimous

16

verdict recommending the death sentence.
QUESTION:

17

Some time between 30 minutes and

Was there .some sort of a stipulation as

18

to what the judge should do or say when the jury came back

19

and said they were in great distress?
MR. KLINGSBERG:

20

There is reference to a discussion

21

in chambers which is not on the record in which it appears

22

that there is a stipulation as to the polling procedure.

23

However —

24
25

QUESTION:

If it isn't in the record, how do you

know about it?

MR. KLINGSBERG:

1

The judge stated on the record

2

that there was a discussion in chambers where there was a

3

stipulation —

4

QUESTION:

As to how he should proceed?

5

MR. KLINGSBERG:

That's correct, Your Honor, and

6

I might also add in that connection that earlier that morning,

7

right after the jury came in with the note, and right after

8

the vote, there were motions for a mistrial in which defense

9

counsel objected to the entire procedure of continuing on in

10

the face of a Louisiana code provision which expressly pro­

11

vided that in the event of a lack of unanimity on the part

12

of the jury or the jury's inability to agree that a sentence

13

of life without parole or probation must be imposed.
Counsel also asked the Court on the record to

14
15

instruct the jury that there is no obligation under the law

16

to reach a verdict, and that application was denied, and an

17

objection was taken thereto.

18

Now, in assessing --

19

QUESTION:

May I ask, since you have been interrupted

20

on this point about, we

21

stipulation, but generally the procedures to be followed, is

22

it your understanding that the stipulation contemplated that

23

the jurors who voted each way on this issue would be identi­

24

fied?

25

MR. KLINGSBERG:

don't know the specifics of the

It appears that way from the
5

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

1

record, Your Honor.

2

QUESTION:

3

Was any specific objection made on the

record by the petitioner to the polling of the jurors by name?

4

MR. KLINGSBERG:

5

QUESTION:

6

No, Your Honor, there was not.

That was not raised in the Fifth Circuit,

either?
MR. KLINGSBERG:

7

That was not — that has not been

8

raised, and indeed, as indicated in our reply brief at Note 6,

9

it does not under the law of Louisiana and this Court result in

10

any lack of preservation of that point because the Louisiana

11

courts consider on death penalty cases all matters, whether

12

objection was raised, and this was dealt with on the merits in

13
14

the

state and federal habeas proceedings as well as in the

Supreme Court of Louisiana.

15

Now, in assessing whether or not the procedures used

16

here had a coercive tendency, it is necessary to consider that

17

the jury in a capital sentencing hearing is peculiarly

18

sensitive to being swayed by pressures from the trial judge.

19

Unlike a guilt determination, where a jury is determining,

20

based on what it sees and hears, some objective fact in

21

deciding whether to impose the death penalty the jurors are

22

formulating a reasoned moral response and engaging in highly

23

subjective, unique, individualized assessment of whether a

24

particular person deserves to die, and here the reliability

25

of this sensitive and unique procedure and inquiry was
6

1

threatened by the pressure which was inevitably placed on

2

those four minority jurors and later one lone juror who had

3

to publicly identify themselves as being opposed to the con­

4

tinuation of deliberations.

5

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor?

When you said minority, do we know that

6

the four who said that there would be no use in continuing were

7

the four, were four who were voting against the death penalty?

MR. KLINGSBERG:

We don't know for sure, but we

know this —
QUESTION:

I mean, I might have been in the

majority and thought there would be no use going any further.
MR. KLINGSBERG:

Well, we know, Your Honor, that

13

there were some jurors who opposed the death penalty being

14

recommended in this case.

15

hypothetically possible that they were on one side or the

16

other, but logic dictates that the jurors who said let's stop

17

deliberation, which under the Louisiana statute meant that a

18

life sentence would be imposed, that among those jurors were

19

the jurors who opposed the death sentence being recommended

20

in this case.

21

QUESTION:

Now, who were those jurors?

It is

I don't see why logic would dictate

22

that, unless you assumed that the jury was not following the

23

court's instructions, which we normally don't assume.

24

court didn't ask them, how manv of you want to quit now, so

25

that, you know, so that vou will prevail.

He asked them,

I don t

Well, one might draw an analogv,

Your Honor, to the Adams versus Texas situation where this

10

Court said that it was hypothetically possible that the juror

11

who stated his views on the death penalty might be believing

12

in an eye for an eye, but it was undeniable and logical that

13

among the jurors who identified themselves as being subject to

14

influence by the death penalty were likely to be those who

15

opposed it, and I think the same logic would prevail in this

16

particular case.

17

Moreover, as Justice Stone indicated in Brasfield —

18

QUESTION:

How do you account for the fact that it

19

goes from just four to one after the second vote?

20

you obviously have some of the people who — apparently they

21

hadn't changed their view on the death penalty in the

22

interim.

23

of them must have voted in the second vote to say we will -- it

24

would be worthwhile to deliberate further.

25

were there in the second vote, I don't know how one can say

There had been no more deliberations.

I mean,

And yet some

So if some of them

1

that none of them were there in the first vote.
MR. KLINGSBERG:

2

One can say, and all we need to

3

establish here is a risk or a probability that there was an

4

improper influence on the jury, that when the court instructed

5

the jury that if they voted to stop deliberations or if they

6

couldn't reach an agreement that a life sentence would be

7

imposed, and then the court engaged in these repetitive pro­

8

cedures and didn't call a halt, that a message was coming from

9

the judge that the judge favored the death penalty, and this

10

was emphasized in the modified Allen charge where the judge

11

said the jury should have the objective of reaching a just

12

verdict, a verdict only being necessary to impose death,

13

cessation of deliberations leading to an imposition of life

14

sentence.

15

QUESTION:

That may be.

I am hot saying that that

16

argument is gone.

I am just saying it doesn't seem to me you

17

can categorically

say that one of the indications of pressure

18

is that those who were voting against the death penalty were

19

singled out.

20

were the four who were voting against the death penalty.

21

It doesn't seem to me you can say that the four

MR. KLINGSBERG:

Well, as Justice Stone recognized

22

in the Brasfield case and Chieft Justice Burger recognized in

23

Gypsum, there is no way to ascertain

24

of these practices are on the jurors, and what this Court has

25

to ascertain, and this is consonant with the Court's death

for sure what the effect

case we certainly submit that there was a risk.

In this

And the risk

was especially serious in light of the finality of the death
sentence.

As the Court indicated in Booth against Maryland

regarding victim impact statements, the Court must avoid the
risk that a death sentence will be based on considerations
that are constitutionally irrelevant or impermissible.
An analogy may be drawn to the Bruten case or the
recent Cruz case this Court decided where the Court also talked
about risks, and the consequences of failure so vital to the
defendant that the practical and human limitations on the jury
12

system cannot be ignored, so that if this one lone juror was

13

opposed to the death sentence, and it is apparent that some­

14

body was, because otherwise there would have been a unanimous

15

verdict, so that would indicate that that juror was one who

16

indicated that there should be a cessation, and therefore

17

there should be a life sentence.

18

a great deal of pressure, having put his name down on a piece

19

of paper, with the risk of that being public, and was in a

20

particularly sensitive situation when the judge delivered the

21

Allen charge.

himself might have thought, you know, I'm a pretty open

fellow, and I'd like to talk about it.

9

that's not the case, do we?

One of the eleven may have thought that this one fellow

QUESTION:

We don't know that

That —

You are just assuming that the one

12

individual is the one that was voting against capital punish­

13

ment.

14

We don't really know that.
MR. KLINGSBERG:

We can't ever know for sure in

15

these situations, and that is why this Court has consistently

16

said that it is going to examine into the probability of

17

improper influence on the jury.

18

into the nature of the procedures and to ascertain

19

those procedures are inherently coercive, and also to ascer­

20

tain whether or not the procedure serves any useful purpose.

21

The Court is going to examine
whether

In Gardner, for example, dealing with the pre­

22

sentence reports, the Court said there was insufficient state

23

interest of purpose in not disclosing the pre-sentence report,

24

and in Adams against Texas and in Turner v. Murray

25

has always inquired in, for example, to the ease with which

for coercion, without any useful purpose.
QUESTION:

You acknowledge, at least, Mr. Klingsberg,

12

that it is a lot less threatening to the jury for the judge to

13

look at them and say, how many of you think it will be of any

14

use to deliberate further than it is to say to them, how many

15

of you voted against, you know, how many of you are in the

16

minority voting against the majority verdict?

17

more threatening, isn't it, a question?

18

MR. KLINGSBERG:

19

QUESTION:

20

21

That is a lot

Yes, Your Honor, although —

And that is not the question that was

asked here.
MR. KLINGSBERG:

That's correct, Your Honor, but I

22

think that compared, for example, to Brasfield, there the

23

Court did not ascertain which side each one on the count was.

24

Here, we knew which jurors wanted to continue, which jurors

25

didn't want to continue, and there were two polls, and it was
12

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

1

followed by the admonition to come and reach a just verdict,

2

and under those circumstances I would respectfully submit not

3

that Allen charges should be banned in all cases, for example,

4

in a guilt phase trial where the societal purpose to do so,

5

avoiding retrials, but that in a sentencing phase of a capital

6

punishment situation the Court should impose some limits.

7

Those limits are not intrusive, and do not — would not inter­

8

fere with the effective conduct of sentencing phase pro­

9

ceedings, particularly where you have a statute, as you do in

10

Louisiana, as you do in three other states, Florida and others

11

we have cited in our brief, where Supreme Courts have held

12

that giving an Allen charge in the face of such a statute has

13

a tendency to coerce and have reversed death sentences.

14

I would like, if I may, to turn to the second point,

15

which is that at the end of the guilt or innocence phase trial

16

the Court instructed the jury in accordance with the Louisiana

17

code that in order to convict for first degree murder it must

18

find that the defendand had a specific

19

inflict bodily harm on more than one person.

20

intent to kill or

The trial judge also cautioned the jury at the guilt

21

phase, and this is important because it shows that in making

22

this finding the jury was not making the individualized assess­

23

ment of whether or not the death sentence was reasonably

24

justified during the guilt phase, the trial judge said, you

25

are not to discuss in any way the possibility of any
13

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

1

penalties whatsoever.

2

reaches a verdict of first degree murder that there is any

3

subsequent hearing dealing with the penalty.

4

It is only in the event the jury

At the separate sentencing hearing, the prosecutor

5

told the jury that one of the statutory aggravating circum­

6

stances on which the state was relying was that the offender

7

knowingly created a risk of death or great bodily harm to more

8

than one person, and then said, now you will notice that is

9

also an element of first degree murder that you have already

10

found in this case.
On two of the counts that was the only aggravating

11
12

circumstance found, and on the other count a second circum­

13

stance was found and set aside by the Supreme Court of

14

Lousiana so that the sole aggravating circumstance supporting

15

the death sentence was the same as the element already found,

16

as the prosecutor told the jury, in order to convict for first

17

degree murder.
Based on these facts, we contend that as applied to

18
19

petitioner, the Louisiana capital punishment scheme failed

20

to meet the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments requirement of

21

providing a meaningful basis for distinguishing the cases in

22

which the death penalty is imposed from those in which it is

23

not.

24
25

Following Furman, Louisiana enacted a mandatory
scheme which was struck down in Roberts where the Court, the
14

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

1

plurality opinion said that this procedure lacks standards to

2

guide the jury in selecting among first degree murderers.

3

that standard is not met by the circumstances here.

4

Court said as to the North Carolina scheme in Woodson, "There

5

are no standards provided to guide the jury in the exercise of

6

its power to select those first degree murderers who will

7

receive the death sentence."

And the

Now, Louisiana sought to cure this deficiency by

8
9

And

requiring at least one statutory aggravating citcumstanace to

10

be found at the sentencing stage, modeling its scheme after

11

Gray, and as this Court stated in Zant, the approval in Gregg

12

of Georgia's capital punishment scheme rested on the feature

13

being that the jury was required to find at least one valid

14

statutory aggravating circumstance and to identify it in

15

writing.

16

circumstances, but a fundamental requirement was that each

17

statutory aggravating circumstance satisfy a constitutional

18

standard derived from the principles of Furman.

Not only was it essential to have aggravating

19

The Court would not have been concerned with the

20

standards for aggravating circumstance if that were not an

21

essential element of a constitutional death sentence.

22

the Court said in Zant, the aggravating circumstance must

23

genuinely narrow the class of persons eligible and must

24

reasonably justify the imposition of a more severe sentence.

25

Since, as this Court held, the aggravating
15

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

And as

1

circumstance must reasonably justify the imposition of a more

2

severe sentence on petitioner than others found guilty of

3

first degree murder, that narrowing and channeling function

4

cannot be fulfilled meaningfully where precisely the same

5

circumstance is an element of the finding of guilt of first

6

degree murder in the first place.

7

QUESTION:

Well, why isn't that narrowing provided

8

by the fact that the jurors have to consider mitigating cir­

9

cumstances at the sentencing hearing, and tailor the decision

10

to this individual after consideration of those mitigating

11

circumstances.

12

MR. KLINGSBERG:

As this Court recognized in Zant,

13

Your Honor, it is the aggravating circumstance which provides

14

the narrowing function.

15

which must be found beyond a reasonable doubt and identified,

16

thus creating this threshold narrowing or gatekeeping function.

17

Then the jury goes on, according to the statute, and just

18

considers mitigating circumstances.

19

QUESTION:

It is the aggravating circumstance

Do you think Zant and Jurek stand for

20

the proposition that the sentencer has to consider the aggra­

21

vating circumstances as opposed to having the legislative body

22

define which aggravating circumstances would narrow?

23

MR. KLINGSBERG:

Well, in Jurek there was some

24

suggestion in the Court's opinion that some narrowing occurred

25

at the guilt phase.

However, there were these three
16

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

1

questions under the Texas statute whichi had to be found

2

beyond a reasonable doubt, and in three or four subsequent

3

decisions which we cite this Court has said, those three

4

questions are, and indeed they are, equivalent to finding

5

aggravating circumstances.

6

Now, is it possible constitutionally for a legisla­

7

ture to say, we are only going to do the narrowing at the

8

field phase?

9

the jury here was not engaged in the kind of individual

Well, that is not what Louisiana did here, and

10

assessment, subjective inquiry, and so forth which this Court

11

has held must be made in the sentencing hearing.

12

not focusing on guilt.

13

QUESTION:

They were

They certainly were with regard to

14

mitigation, weren't they?

15

MR. KLINGSBERG:

16

QUESTION:

I am sorry, Your Honor?

They certainly were with regard to

17

mitigating circumstances.

18

MR. KLINGSBERG:

Yes, Your Honor, but Number One,

19

this Court has never held that it would be constitutional to

20

have, say, a mandatory statute that certain types of crimes

21

are mandated to first degree murder and only in mitigating

22

circumstances, because the jury here just has to consider

23

mitigating circumstances.

24
25

QUESTION:

We didn't hold that, but on the other

hand, last term we had a case somewhere in which the issue
17

Acme Reporting Company
<202)

628-4888

1

was precisely that.

2

MR. KLINGSBERG:

3

QUESTION:

Yes.

It was a much easier case.

What it was

4

was a statute that said, if you are serving a life sentence

5

without the possibility of parole and commit first degree

6

murder, you automatically are subjected to capital punishment.

7

We struck that down, but only because — the reason we struck

8

it down was that the statute did not allow mitigating circum­

9

stances to be considered.
What we are saying is, that statute was bad on its

10

11

face and mitigating circumstances are not because it didn't

12

allow aggravating circumstances to be considered.

13

no mention of that.

14

tell us it really was.

It seemed like a harder case than you now

MR. KLINGSBERG:

15

But we made

Yes.

QUESTION:

I am talking about the Court's analysis,

not what it decided.
MR. KLINGSBERG:

Yes.

The Court's analysis was

10

focused on whether all mitigating circumstances, statutory or

11

nonstatutory, should be permitted, and this Court in a long

12

series of opinions has held repeatedly that there should not

13

be a limitation on the mitigating circumstances to be con­

14

sidered, and that human decency requires that.

15

different from saying, and I don't think there is any analysis

16

on that case which says that there does not have to be some­

17

thing, some element, some keystone which performs this

18

threshold narrowing and gatekeeping function in the context

19

where the jury is focusing.

QUESTION:

That is quite

In your view, would the Nevada statute

21

have been unconstitutional even though it allowed for con­

The Nevada statute would be con­

stitutional if it provides at some point when the jury has in

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. MAMOULIDES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

5

please the Court, I would like to address at this time the

6

second phase of the two issues, the constitutionality of the

7

Louisiana state statute on the death penalty, and go back to

8

the first issue afterwards.

9

THe allegations by petitioner make it clear that

10

they feel that the Louisiana statute should fall.

11

is one of those states that chose to narrow the threshold for

12

those crimes that can be determined to be and carry with them

13

the possibility of a death sentence in the definitive stage

14

of their statute, and in doing so they -- in this definitive

15

stage Louisiana has said that capital murder, or in this case

16

first degree murder, is defined as three circumstances or

17

facts.

18

circumstances or facts — this case deals with the third

19

factor, that is, the intentional killing of a person with a

QUESTION:

MR. MAMOULIDES:

4
5

I see.
The jury had access to those items

while it was deliberating.
Now, Your Honor, turning to the issue in the first

6

argument of petitioner, that is, whether or not there was

7

coercion in this case by the court in administering a modified

8

Allen charge and polling the jury, Louisiana allows the use

9

of a modified Allen charge.

As a matter of fact, the state

10

has a legitimate reason, a valid reason to use a modified

11

Allen charge even in a sentencing procedure.

12

After all, jurors have taken an oath, they have taken

13

an oath of responsibility to reach a verdict, to attempt to

14

reach a verdict.

15

severe because they are deciding life or death of an individual

16

The jury as a representative of the people, maybe the conscienc

17

of the commjnity, has in fact the life or death of an indivi­

18

dual person in their hands.

In a capital case, that oath is even more

19

In Louisiana, the judge in this case was well

20

within his discretion when for the first time this jury

21

indicated that it had any problem at all, he called in -- and

22

that was done by virtue of the note that came in at 3:00

23

o'clock on the afternoon of the 16th of April, the judge then

24

called the defense attorney and the prosecuting attorney to

25

discuss how they would handle the note.

Now, in this situation they weren't talking about a

Yes, but that is polling them after they

have returned a verdict.

12

for polling after a verdict has come in.

13

MR. MAMOULIDES:

Yes, but when they decided they

14

would poll the jury, it was decided that it should not be

done orally to identify them, that it should be done by them

17

to determine whether or not that procedure was valid was

to say that the judge's charge leaned toward death penalty is

off by saying that if you are unable to reach a decision the

hours it certainly cannot be a foregone conclusion that if they

8

had been directed to make a meaningful finding and hadn't been

9

told by the prosecutor that they had already found that so

10

they don't have to bother with it again, what that result

11

might be, and where there is a legal element which is lacking

12

in the procedure, particularly in a death sentence case, that

13

does

14

indicated, for example, in Gray against Mississippi, that

15

should be — that is so basic that it should not be treated

16

as a harmless error type of situation.

17

not seem to me to be the kind of thing, as the Court

If I may just say a word about the Sumner case, which

18

Your Honor asked me about earlier,

the Court there in its

19

analysis as well as its holding focused only on the discre­

20

tionary aspect of the proceeding, that is, that mitigating

21

circumstances regarding character and record of the offender

22

and so forth were not allowed to be considered, and neither the

23

Court's analysis nor the holding focused on whether, if there

24

had been mitigating circumstances allowed, and you just have

25

sitting out there a mandatory death sentence in a particular

1

circumstance, and there it was extremely narrow, only where

2

someone is serving a life sentence, and you had mitigating

3

circumstances, whether or not the Court would nevertheless

4

continue to hold, as it has emphasized in numerous cases

5

since Furman, that there is a necessity for finding beyond a

6

reasonable doubt a specified statutory aggravating circumstance

7

in order to perform this narrowing and channeling function.
In Nevada,

8

there was an indication that the statute

9

defined capital murder, and it is not clear whether the jury

10

when it was considering whether to find the defendant guilty

11

of capital murder from the decision, the court didn't focus

12

on it, whether the jury was engaged in the individualized

13

assessment and process of determining whether the death

14

sentence was reasonably justified.

15

v

Indeed, it may well have done so, but in our case

16

it is clear that the jury was told at the guilt phase that it

17

is not to consider sentencing, and it is not to engage in that

18

kind of process of deciding whether death was reasonably

19

justified.

20

It is clear from, for example, Adams against Texas,

21

from Zant, that the process of assessing or considering miti­

22

gating circumstances involves a wide range of discretion.

23

the Furman case and all the cases since then have indicated

24

that there must be some kind of procedure, some element, some

25

keystone for channeling and narrowing on the basis of
