Mr. Crowley, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NOEL C. CROWLEY, ESQUIRE
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. CROWLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11

please the Court, the appellant in this lawsut is Bendix

12

Autolite Corporation.

13

Midwesco Enterprises, under which Midwesco sold and

14

installed in State of Ohio a particular boiler which turned

15

out to be defective.

16

It had a contract with the appellee,

The contract was fully performed in the State of

17

Ohio, but Bendix has been denied the right to maintain an

18

action in the State of Ohio because the applicable four-year

19

statute of limitations had expired, and whether the action

20

is maintainable at this time depends on the constitutionality

21

under the commerce clause of a particular Ohio tolling

22

statute which suspends the runninq of the period of

23

limitations in situations as we have here where the defendant

24

can't be served within the State of Ohio.

25

Both the District Court and the Circuit Court have

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

3

1

held, and we say incorrectly, that the Ohio tolling statute

2

constitutes an impermissible burden on interstate commerce.

3

Those rulings were incorrect, we contend, because the supposed

4

burden on commerce is so slight and so speculative as to make

5

it questionable whether the burden has any reality at all.

6

QUESTION:

You say then that the Ohio tolling

7

statute should have been allowed to be applied by the Ohio

8

courts and therefore it would not have run against you in

9

your action against Midwesco?

10

MR. CROWLEY:

Precisely so.

We maintain that

11

such theoretical burden as may exist is purely incidental

12

to a valid state purpose and is clearly outweighed by the

13

resultant benefits which have been achieved for the benefit

14

of Ohio citizens, and those benefits, as I will explain in

15

a moment, are not at all theoretical, but have been

16

explicitly

17

state concern by this Court's 1982 decision in the case of

18

G.D. Searle and Company against Cohn, which we cite in our

19

brief.

20

recognized as valid and legitimate objects of

Now, the obvious purpose of the Ohio tolling

21

statute is to preserve the right of Ohio citizens to assert

22

claims against individuals and corporations who are not

23

amenable to service within the state either because they once

24

lived there and later moved away or because they are

25

concealing themselves within the state, or because they never

lived there at all.

2

QUESTION:

3

Well, it also -- it just doesn't benefit

Ohio citizens, does it?

4

MR. CROWLEY:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. CROWLEY:

7

Anybody who is -No, just —

Anybody who sues in Ohio.
Certainly that would follow.

Yes, indeed.

8

QUESTION:

All right.

9

MR. CROWLEY:

The statute here in question is

10

virtually identical to a particular New Jersey statute which

11

this Court reviewed in the Searle case.

12

accused by our opponents here of misreading Searle, and also

13

as behaving as though Searle fully disposed of all .the

14

issues and compels a decision in our favor.

15

position, and I think our brief acknowledges that it is not

16

the case.

Now, we are

That is not our

/

17

But the Searle case does conclusively establish

18

that a statute of the sort we are talking about does have

19

a legitimate state purpose, and it is a purpose that remains

20

valid and subsisting, notwithstanding the adoption by the

21

State of Ohio of an alternative method of addressing the same

22

concern, and that is the process for longarm service.

23

Arrangements for in-state service continue to be

24

of benefit, as this Court pointed out in Searle, because it

25

can't always be guaranteed that a particular company, a

Acme Reporting Company

628-4888

5

1

particular out of state company or out of state individual

2

can actually be found.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. CROWLEY:

5

QUESTION: -- if the only way to satisfy the

Mr. Crowley —
Yes, Your Honor.

6

requirement of Ohio's statute is for the foreign company to

7

come in and actual register to do business for all purposes,

8

do you concede that it would fail under the commerce clause?

9

MR. CROWLEY: No, we don't at all concede.

10

welcome the chance to point out that we don't suppose that to

11

be the situation at all in Ohio, that that isn't by any means

12

the only way --

13
14

QUESTION:

We

I guess you didn't hear my question then

or maybe I misstated it.

15

MR. CROWLEY:

16

QUESTION:

Forqive me.

If the only way of complying with the

17

Ohio statute is to register for all purposes, do you concede

18

that the commerce clause burden would be such that the

19

statute would fail?

20

MR. CROWLEY:

No, and I understand Your Honor's

21

question, and it is a little hard to reckon with the question

22

if that was the only way of complying.

23

doesn't require any kind of behavior at all.

24
25

QUESTION:

The Ohio statute

We will get to that in a minute.

I

would like you to address that question first, and I just

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

6

1

wonder what authority you rely on for thinking that that

2

would not be so burdensome as to fail.

3

MR. CROWLEY:

What it is not, Justice O'Connor, what

4

it is not is a forced licensure statute.

5

if it were a forced licensure statute, that if as a practical

6

matter the only way you could do business in Ohio was to

7

qualify to do business, we would concede under that set of

8

facts that it would fail, but there is a great disparity

9

between what we are talking about here and the so-called

10
11

We concede that

forced licensure statutes.
QUESTION:

I'm not sure I'm following you.

Do you

12

concede that if the only way to get the benefit of the shorter

13

statute of limitations were to become licensed for all

14

purposes in Ohio, it would be unconstitutional?

15

MR. CROWLEY:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. CROWLEY:

No, we do not so concede.

I thought that's what you just said.
No.

We thought if it could fairly

18

be said of the statute that you had to qualify to do

19

business, that —

20

QUESTION:

In order to do what?

21

MR. CROWLEY:

In order to seriously expect to

22

do business

in the state, as, for example, in the Allenberg

23

Cotton case, where there is a familiar kind of statute and

24

where the situation is such that you are under that statute

25

denied access to the courts of the state unless and until

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

7
1

you qualify to do business, and they are describing business

2

which is of an interstate character.

3

properly said as far as we are concerned, very properly said

4

that a statute of that sort is so tantamount to a direct

5

order to license --

6

QUESTION:

7

The Court very

Well, I thought that was my question

exactly.

8

MR. CROWLEY:

9

QUESTION:

Well, I had difficulty with --

And I have different responses from

10

you now to Justice Scalia and to me and I don't know what

11

your position is.

12

MR. CROWLEY:

I am putting it badly, but I under­

13

stand our position and I am qoing to try once again to

14

explain it.

15

It is, if you, as a condition of doing business if

16

you had an Allenberg Cotton type of situation, properly

17

described as a forced licensure situation, and if the

18

consequence of not being qualified to do business was that

19

you can't go to the courts of that state, in other words,

20

you can sell things, but if the people don't voluntarily

21

pay you you have no --

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

Well, here the consequence is simply

that the statute of limitations is not tolled.
MR. CROWLEY:

Yes, exactly, and we don't think that

that is sufficiently coercive.

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

8

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. CROWLEY:

You think that is different somehow.
It most assuredly is different.

It

3

is not sufficiently coercive as to obligate somebody to

4

do anything.

5

things and to be subject to suit and to have to defend suit

6

on the merits and not have .the defense of the statute of

7

limitations.

8
9

It is not an intolerable situation to sell

So, again, yes, if it were true that it was forced
licensure it would be invalid.

It is not, even if it was

10

the only means of compliance, and it is not, an invalid

11

statute here because of the great disparity in severity of

12

sanctions between forced licensure and this.

13

QUESTION:

Now, the courts below in this case

14

apparently did not find that the statute, the tolling

15

statute would be met by a provision in the contract.

16

MR. CROWLEY: We are puzzled and to some extent

17

confounded by what the reasoning of the Circuit Court was

18

in that regard.

19

happened, that there could have been a designation of an

20

agent in this individual contract which would not have -QUESTION:

21
22
23

They acknowledged that it could have

But they said that didn't answer the

question.
MR. CROWLEY:

Yes, and we are at a loss to know

24

just what they meant by that.

If they meant that there

25

would have been other remaining constitutional questions

(202)

628-4888

1

as aptblied to other people, that treatment was wrong for

2

the reason we say it is wrong in our brief, that --

3

QUESTION:

4

is on that subject?

5

How are we to know what the state law

MR. CROWLEY:

I think there is nothing in

6

the statute itself which even refers to licensure, so all

7

that can be said of licensure is that it is one means of

8

appointing an agent for the service of process.

9

have an Ohio state law and we have cited it in our brief

We certainly

10

that says the means by which you serve a company is among

11

other things to serve an agent.

12

appointed as an agent, you have served the company.

13

take it it follows inexorably from that that any time you have

14

somebody designated as an agent who is resident in the State

15

of Ohio so that you can make the service within that state,

16

you have provided a means of service and you have defeated

17

the tolling statute, so that it simply doesn't apply.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

You serve somebody who is
So I

He has to be an agent for service in

all matters, not just in the particular contract.
MR. CROWLEY:

No, there is nothing .in the

21

statute to suggest that that would be the case.

22

agent for the particular service that is being made --

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. CROWLEY:

25

If he is an

That would do it.
-- that should be in all respects

sufficient. There is nothing in any of the statutes, any of

the decisions to suggest anything to the contrary.

2

other cases from other jurisdictions, and we cite them in

3

our brief, saying that with respect to the federal counterpart

4

of the Ohio statute, saying that where there is a designation

5

by contract it can be as limited as the parties to the

6

contract want to make it.

We have

7

In this case the designation not onlv could have

8

been limited to Bendix, it could have been limited even as

9

to Bendix to claims arising out of this particular contract.

10

And that would have been a full and sufficient answer to the

11

attempt to apply the tolling statute in this case.

12

13
14
15

QUESTION:

Tell me, what is the case that holds

that would have been a sufficient answer?
MR. CROWLEY:

It is a particular Virginia District

Court opinion, and it is quoted in our brief.

QUESTION:

MR. CROWLEY:

QUESTION:

19

MR. CROWLEY:

A Virginia case?
Yes.

Nothing from this State of Ohio?
No, but it is not talking about a

20

particular statute, it is just talking about, in general

21

about the designation of agents.

22
23

QUESTION:

Certainly —

The Ohio statute hasn't been construed

on this point, though, has it?

24

MR. CROWLEY:

25

QUESTION:

Forgive me.

The Ohio statute has not been construed

on this point.

your position?

There are no Ohio authorities supporting

MR. CROWLEY:

I think there are Ohio decisions

that confirm that if a corporation has an agent present

5

within the state, that that makes it present within the state

6

for purposes of the tolling statute.

established, and I don't think there should be any remaining

8

question once that is established on, of course, that

9

point.

10

QUESTION:

I think that much is

That is something of a burden, to have

11

a general corporation resident for -- what you are saying

12

is, you have to agree in order to get the benefit of the

13

-- or not to be -- not to have the burden of the tolling

14

statute you have to have a resident there for all purposes

15

and be sued by anybody who wants to sue you in that state.

16

That is something of a burden.

17

MR. CROWLEY:

18
19

If that were the fact that would be

a substantial burden.
QUESTION:

No, but those are the only cases that

20

you have in Ohio that talk about a general agent for

21

service, right?

22

MR. CROWLEY:

I don't understand that the cases

23

we have in mind establish whether it is general or

24

specific, and I can't imagine any reason why a narrow and

25

specific appointment, if indeed it is a real appointment,

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

12

1

should be any the less efficacious as regards the

2

particular claim to which it is addressed.

3

don't do anything else today I should like to differentiate

4

this case from the forced licensure kind of case.

5

I guess if I

In forced licensure, where you tell the court --

6

correction, tell the company that it can't use the courts

7

of that state unless it qualifies to do business that

8

statute has no purpose other than to induce licensure.

9

doesn't serve any interests of the state simply to deny

10

various companies access to the courts.

11

sense as an inducement to make them do something.

12

QUESTION:

It

It only makes
Nothing --

But isn't one proviso of the Allenberg

13

holding that the company has to be engaged only in interstate

14

commerce?

15

MR. CROWLEY:

Oh, very much so.

Yes, if the

16

company is become localized and is a domesticated company,

17

it is indistinguishable from any other company resident in

18

Ohio, and I take it for that reason there is no

19

constitutional problem as to that, and it would be perfectly

20

valid to deny that company access to the courts unless and

21

until it is qualified to do business.

22

But reverting to the other point, there is not the

23

tiniest suggestion that this tolling statute here in question

24

is intended to..induce any kind of behavior at all on the part

25

of companies or individuals or anybody else, nothing to

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

13

1

suggest that the legislature didn't fully achieve its

2

purpose simply when it extended the limitation period,

3

that it had any purpose beyond that or that it cared at all

4

about whether somebody qualified to do business entered

5

into busines or not, and if they had had any such intent,

6

if the idea had been to compel companies to take out a

7

license, certainly the statute would have been poorly suited

8

to that end, and there isn't the tiniest hint or

9

suggestion in the record in this case that as — that it has

10

had that practical effect, that companies that might not have

11

been of a mind to do so have ever felt compelled to qualify

12

to do business, and it simply isn't the same kind of

13

restraint that we are talking about.

14

We have read the recent or modern commerce

15

clause cases by this Court, and we understand that some

16

of them go further than some scholarly commentators would

17

have had it go, or than some members of the Court itself

18

would have had it go, but at least with those cases, all

19

of them involved matters that had the potential, at least,

20

for some serious economic or regulatory dislocation.

21

If, for example, you try to regulate the width

22

of a truck or the length of a truck, as was done in the

23

Raymond Motor case, or the South Carolina against Barnwell

24

Brothers case, that is a serious restraint.

25

no trouble understanding that that is something to talk

we want to incorporate by reference everything he said about

20

the supposed restraining effect of the New Jersey statute

21

there in question, and his wording describing that burden

22

was, it is slight.

We would say that certainly it is slight --

QUESTION:

MR. CROWLEY:

No, I don't think —

You don't.
It occurs to us, it occurs to us

4

that this case may be a fitting occasion for the Court

5

saying that there is a burden that is so slight, so

speculative, so insubstantial that it shouldn't ever be

subjected to hostile scrutiny either under the so-called

per se test or the balancing test, aid this would be an

occasion for that, but to reach the result we want we

17

And on the basis of that every lower court that has

18

considered this matter either in this case or in the case

19

of Coons against American Honda has made the automatic

20

association that, oh, this is one of those forced

21

licensure cases, and without any analysis at all, any

22

examination of what truly is happening under this Ohio

statute, have lept to the conclusion that on the

QUESTION:

Mr. Crowley, I have a special concern

3

about whether this statute is discriminatory in the sense

4

that it is peculiarly directed against out of state companies

5

or against interstate business.

6

MR. CROWLEY:

7

QUESTION:

Is it or isn't?

It most assuredly is not.

You could be, I take it, a domestic

8

company in that state or could have been at the time of the

9

alleged tort and then if you move your companv elsewhere

10

you would still be liable.

11

MR. CROWLEY:

12

QUESTION:

13

Absolutely.

The tolling statute would apply.

Or

if you were a private citizen, never mind companies —

14

MR. CROWLEY:

15

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

-- if you were a private citizen and

16

didn't even move your residence but -- well, I guess you

17

could be served at your residence, I don't know.

18

19

while you were gone.

20

MR. CROWLEY:

If you

I take it that it would, and the cases

21

seemed -- the Ohio cases seemed to indicate that where there

22

is a sojourn of substantial length out of the state, that

23

the tolling does apply.

24

not to count.

25

If it is a vacation trip, that seems

But all of that is — proceeds on the assumption

Acme Reporting Company
(202) 628-4888

17

that the only way to avoid the detriment of the tolling

2

statute is to qualify to do business.

3

that is a matter of greater interest to the Court, and so

4

we put that first.

We suppose that

MR. CROWLEY:

We

What are you going

I think we have sort of anticipated

22

that question, first of all, that that would be a puzzling

23

response for the other company to make, because presumably

24

they benefit from having an in-state agent on whom they

25

can effect the service, so it would be puzzling to see them

resist it, but if they did, arbitrarily or whatever, the

2

other company simply writes them a letter unilaterally

designating, saying, if you have any quarrel with this

4

contract, any claim, we have appointed somebody our agent,

5

he is in the City of Cleveland, and here is where you can

6

find him.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. CROWLEY:

9

And how long will he be there?
I think that is a sufficient answer

to the whole of it.
We see in the record and we concede it is a

10
11

somewhat unsatisfactory record of exchanges with the Ohio

12

Secretary of State's office.
QUESTION:

13

Well, that may be — if you make a

14

contract, that may be right, but what about product

liability?

16

MR. CROWLEY:

QUESTION:

18
19

This —

You don't write around to somebody

who gets hurt by one of your products.
MR. CROWLEY:

Well, that is a distinguishable

20

case, not the case presented here, but we are indebted to

21

Judge Potter in the District Court in Toledo for making

22

the suggestion in oral argument that it might be perfectly

23

feasible for a company to designate an agent on the product

24

itself, and that is not an issue we are raising here --

25

QUESTION:

Does Ohio have any formal mechanism

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

19

1

by which you may appoint an agent for service of process

2

in the state without qualifying to do business?

3

MR. CROWLEY:

That is the -- what I was starting

4

to explore, talking about the correspondence that is in the

5

record that was exchanged with the Ohio Secretary of State's

6

office, and there are two letters.

7

contradictory.

8
9

The letters are really

The first letter says, we would not accept for
filing any such designation apart from the licensure

10

process, in effect.

11

said we would accept such a letter.

12

what we apparently said in the earlier letter, and we

13

would in fact accept something if we were satisfied after

14

an appropriate investigation that it was not intended to

15

circumvent our licensing procedure.

16

was done by somebody wholly in interestate commerce --

17

QUESTION:

I am paraphrasing.

The second letter

We didn't mean to say

That is to say, if it

up or fall in one piece?

valid as applied in this case and invalid as applied in

20

some other circumstance.

21

MR. CROWLEY:

Maybe it might be completely

The answer to the question, put in

22

those terms, is, assuredly not.

It doesn't have to stand

23

or fall in one case, and this being the kind of case it is,

24

its validity, we would respectfully submit, should be

25

iudged on the basis of the operative considerations as we

QUESTION:

The operative considerations are those

where there is no agent been appointed, right?

MR. CROWLEY:

Forgive me, Justice —

One of the operative considerations- that

we find is, there was no agent appointed in Ohio.

MR. CROWLEY:

MR. CROWLEY:

Yes, and that argument is made.

There could have been.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. CROWLEY:

There could have been.

That is your answer.
And if there is a remaining

12

burden, it is because they didn't make the designations, not

13

because of any infirmity in the statute, is our answer.

14

would also point out that this matter of trying to isolate

15

the burden becomes even more illusory when you consider

16

is there even a single claim.

First of all, I will digress and say there is

not a single transaction that is shown in the record here

20

discouraged from doing business by reason of anything we

21

are talking about here, but on the question of what burden

22

there is, how can you tell that a particular claim, if it

23

was brought in the period as extended by the tolling

24

statute would not have been brought sooner if there had been

25

no tolling statute, if there didn't need to be, and in this

practice of law, where it was explained to me, facetiously,

I am sure, that the operative principle in the scheduling

of work activities is, don't put off until tomorrow what

5

you can put off indefinitely.

That brings me finally to the question of

retroactive application.

up the issue of retroactive application from the earliest

time.

from doing so because of the treatment the retroactivity

deliberated about that, examined the issue of retroactivity

and said they weren't going to -- they were not going to make

Well, it was on that set of facts that it looked

like an argument to which the courts were inhospitable, and

3

we didn't make the point. Then, after we had written our

4

brief in chief in the Sixth Circuit, the New Jersey court

5

reversed itself and said, it is a case that should only be

6

applied prospectively and not retroactively, and at that

point with that enhanced value of the arqument, we made it,

We think it should have been understandable

11

the way it arose, and it either is or it isn't, and that

12

is -- we don't think it should be necessary to reach that

13

point, our main point being that there is no -- no under

analysis, an analysis that has never been made in any of

15

the lower courts, under analysis any real burden on commerce,

16

and that is our argument.

MR. BORNSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

22

Please the Court, as counsel indicated, the issue before

23

this Court is very simply whether or not the Ohio tolling

24

25

provision.

And as counsel concedes, each and every

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

23

court which has been faced with this provision or a similar

2

provision has found it to be a constitutional violation.

3

That includes the lower courts here as well as the courts

4

in the Coons case, as well as the McKinley court.

5

And the question that we have to look at, as the

6

Court indicated in Huqhes versus Oklahoma, is the practical

7

operation of .the statute.

have to look at is, there is a tolling statute here, and

9

the tolling statute says that in order to obtain its

10

That is the focus, and what you

benefits there must be physical presence in the state.

11

Now, even though it is somewhat of an anachronism

12

as we pointed out, Ohio may very well be the only state now

13

that holds that physical presence in the state is not the

14

equivalent to being subject to service under the longarm

15

jurisdiction.

16

service within the confines of the state.

17

It is only the same as actual physical

And what we have here is a situation where Bendix

18

had the defendant, Midwesco, served under longarm, and

19

because of that fact and the fact that there must be

20

physical presence, it is necessary to see how that physical

21

presence can be obtained, and the only means and manner in

22

which it can be done is via the qualifications statute of

23

the State of Ohio.

Sixth Circuit was just wrong on that as a matter of Ohio

MR. BORNSTEIN:

Well, what the Sixth Circuit

12

said is that they could have put their provision in there.

13

They didn't state and did not make a decision as to whether

14

or not there would be any validity of such a provision.

15

They merely stated that there could have been such a

16

orovision in there, and in fact I believe that there would

17

not have been any validity because it would allow a

18

corporation to easily circumvent the entire corporate

scheme setup in the State of Ohio.

agreements, these side agreements without having to become

And it would be helpful to know.
It would be helpful to know.

So are we stuck just as we were

8

in the Searle case with not knowing and having to send

9

it back?

10

MR. BORNSTEIN:

No, I don't believe we are,

11

because in Searle the reason that they were stuck was

12

there was what was considered to be a footnote in the

13

Velmohos case which seemed to indicate that possibly there

14

were other means in which it could be done, and in fact

15

after remand, and Coons turned out to be the culmination

16

of Searle, the Supreme Court of New Jersey found there was

17

no other way, and in fact the same argument that there

18

could have been some type of contractual provision was

19

raised in Coons, and the New Jersey Supreme Court said it

,20

can't be done.

QUESTION:

are made.

One is appointing an agent, and the other is

giving notice to the Secretary of State.

Then they say

they could have appointed an aaent, so that is something we
have to deal with.

They say as to the sugaestion giving

notice to the Secretary of State it is hiahly speculating
and devoid of any statutory support.

Now, that suggests to

me by implication that they thought probably the first thing,
appointing an agent for the contract, did have some
statutory support.
MR. BORNSTEIN:

Well, I don't believe so.

I

believe all that they were stating was that the provision
could have been in there, and I believe that because of
the fact the provision was not in there and therefore it was
moot, they were not going to issue a decision as to
whether or not it was valid, but we did raise the araument
in the Sixth Circuit before the court that under the Ohio
statutory scheme it would not be valid and it would allow
one to circumvent it.
QUESTION:

Well, they certainly didn't use your

argument in dealing with the question at all, did they?
MR. BORNSTEIN:

They did not make any statement

in there one way or the other.
As part of the statutory scheme under Section

24

1703.041 of the Ohio Code one is required to appoint a

any and all transitory causes of action, and the courts in

requirements upon a corporation, then they could become

subject to lawsuits throughout the United states despite the

fact that the interstate corporation has no contact with the

In fact, recently in

Eli Lilly versus Savon Drugs this Court pointed out that

it was the conditions, the regulatory conditions that were

being looked, at, and it was not the sanctions at the end,

purpose and idea behind the commerce clause, this idea of

24

preventing economic Balkanization, that the states are not

25

separate economic units, and that you cannot keep

(202)

628-4888

35
1

corporations out of states and prevent them from

2

transacting business.

3

Textbook versus Pigg, the Court said that one cannot impose

4

a condition upon a corporation of another state seeking to

5

do business in the State of Kansas, which is a case of

6

interstate business, and which is a regulation of inter­

7

state commerce, and directly burdens on such commerce.
Again, it is the conditions that are being focused

8
9

As the Court stated in International

on.

It is not the sanctions. It is not the fact that oneis

10

being barred from the courthouse door.

It is the fact that

11

one is being conditioned to become registered, become

12

licensed within the state in order to transact that inter­

13

state business.
And even though the courts found, and we believe

14
15

rightfully found, that there is a per se violation here,

16

even if one were to apply the test, the balancing test of

17

Pike versus Bruce Church, it is our belief, as we have

18

already set out, that that test clearly indicates that there

19

has been a burden upon interstate commerce, because of

20

the fact that one must weigh the consequences, and the only

21

effect as far as the state goes, the state interest that has

22

been established here, is that which this Court found in

23

Searle, which is the fact that there is a certain interest

24

in having one served or be able to be served within the

25

state.

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

36

However, some of which I have already touched upon,

1
2

the effect upon interstate commerce here is great, because

3

of the fact it will subject a corporation to the juris­

4

diction of potentially lawsuits within all 50 states if all

5

50 states should choose to enact similar statutes such as

6

the State of Ohio has done.

7
8

And the effects on interstate commerce that we
noted in our brief, this case is a construction of —

Well, it doesn't subject you to suit.

10

It just means that you can be served in a state.

13

diction within the state if someone should choose to sue

you there.

MR. BORNSTEIN:

Yes, well, if they can find you there.
But if you have been forced to

The only thing that requires you to

That is correct, but what they've

done is, they've taken --

3

QUESTION:

If nobody can sue, if nobody can get

service on you, why, you are not really at much risk.
MR. BORNSTEIN: Well, except the problem is, the

4

statute as drafted allows you to remain liable in perpetuity,

5

and if you are a corporation engaged in interstate

6

commerce, the odds are that they eventually will find

7

you, and they could find you in 50 years or just choose to

8

wait 50 years to find you, or to serve you, and then you

9

would become subject to the jurisdiction of that court

10

because there is no type of time limitation set forth in

11

this at all.

12

This statute is as broad as could be.

QUESTION:

And I. suppose if they find out they

13

could use the longarm statute against you you couldn't get

14

the statute of limitations either.

15

MR. BORNSTEIN:

Unfortunately, you don't have the

16

benefit of that, and therefore even though they could serve

17

you under longarm they could choose to wait 10, 20, 30, or

18

40 years, and the effects, as we point out, this is a

19

construction case.

20

surety bonding companies, insurance companies that are

21

involved in cases such as this, and what'would the effect

22

be if this statute were to be upheld and the principles were

23

to be liable in perpetuity?

24

companies or bonding companies that are willing to

25

undertake that kind of liability if their principal could be

I mean there are bonding companies,

this kind of liability when --

What kind of witnesses will they

QUESTION:

too.

7

MR. BORNSTEIN:

Definitely.

If they -- if the

8

insurance companies or bonding companies themselves would be

9

forced to be defending these cases potentially in myriad

10

states throughout the country, they wouldn't be willing to

11

bond these and these interstate corporations would be unable

12

to come within states such as Ohio and engage in their

13

interstate business.
And the other, the last part of the Pike versus

14
15

Bruce Church test is the fact that the statute has to be

16

narrow, it has to be as narrow as could be, and in fact

17

this statute is the exact opposite.

18

19

time limitation.

20

between the tolling and how long it takes to find a

21

defendant.

22

It is as broad as

It states that it is tolled forever.

There is no

There is no rational relationship at all

So that if it only takes a year they can wait

23

50 years, as we said, and in fact even if they know where

24

the defendant

25

interpretation in Ohio, as Justice White pointed out,

is because of this anachronistic

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

39
1

knowing that longarm jurisdiction will not give a company

2

the protection of the statute of limitations, they can choose

3

to wait.

4

where they are, they can just choose to wait.
QUESTION:

5
6

Even though they have the address and they know

Is there any practical motive that

might impel them to wait, as you point out?
MR. BORNSTEIN:

7

Well, it could very possibly be,

8

if there is a younger plaintiff possibly, but it is often

9

times more difficult for a defendant to defend if there is

10

not someone there directly on point that can testify to what

11

happened, and because of the fact that the burden is more on

12

the defendant in that kind of suit than it is on the

13

plaintiff from the standpoint of trying to have someone

14

there who is physically, you know, in existence at that

15

time, and it might be the type of thing almost like a choice

16

of forum, where depending on the situation there might be in

17

particular instances particular reasons.

18

the foreman on the job is an older person, and there might be

19

a personal injury type case or something, and they are hoping

20

that the person might not be around if they wait a long

21

period of time.
QUESTION:

22

It might be that

But what usually happens is just the

23

opposite.

It is usually the defendant who is hiding, not

24

the plaintiff who is waiting 50 years. It is usually just the

25

opposite.

And this is a statute to meet that problem.

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

40

Now, it applies evenhandedly, and we can't under the

2

constitution grant an exemption to the citizens of Ohio,

3

for example, if a citizen of Ohio, even if he is reachable

4

by longarm, but he takes off, and he is not there, and

5

can't be served, the statute will be tolled.

6

You are asking us to give special benefits to

7

interstate companies, even though citizens in Ohio can be

8

subjected to this dog in the manger process of somebody

9

waiting 50 years, we have to give interstate companies an

10
11

exemption from it.

Why should we do that?

MR. BORNSTEIN:

I disagree that it's evenhanded.

12

I think that it's grossly discriminatory, because of the

13

fact that it's only interstate corporations, which under

14

the statute are compelled in order to obtain this benefit

15

to appoint a statutory agent and become subject to the

16

general jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Ohio,

Don't you want to just reverse the

statute for Ohio residents.

20

to them, wouldn't it?

21

You would not be striking down this

MR. BORNSTEIN:

It would continue to apply

But it would not require them to

22

become subject to the general jurisdiction of the courts

23

of Ohio to appoint an agent in order to do that.

24

this is part of the distinction between the fact a person

25

has physical presence.

A person --

A corporation is a legal fiction.

Acme Reporting
(202)

628-4888

Company

41

1

It doesn't have physical presence.

2

That's why most states except for Ohio state that if you are

3

subject to longarm jurisdiction you get the benefit of a

4

statute such as this.

5

in this aspect, because of the fact the only way they can

6

do it is to appoint a statutory agent and therefore become

7

subject to the general jurisdiction, and a person, an Ohio

8

resident does not have that problem, is not forced into that

9

dilemma or that Hobson's choice.

10

It does business.

Interstate corporations are unique

As far as the letters from the Ohio Secretary of

11

State which were referenced by Mr. Crowley, quite to the

12

contrary, as far as the issue of whether or not there could

13

have just been some type of designation with the Secretary

14

of State, the letters are not different.

15

of both letters is exactly the same, and that's because

16

of the fact the second letter, the December letter, Patricia.

17

Mell stated that in the general course of business the Ohio

18

Secretary of State would not, would not recognize nor accept

19

a designation of agents from an unlicensed foreign

20

corporation, which also indicates as far as the previous

21

questions, is there any indication that a corporation can

22

somehow otherwise appoint an agent, this indicates, no, it

23

can't, because the Ohio Secretary of State themselves

24

has come out and said that you can't, we won't recognize it,

25

we won't even allow it to be filed.

The bottom line

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

42

1

The only way for a company to file this with us

2

is to first become licensed, and the previous letter, from

3

September of 1983 came right out and stated that they will

4

not accept for filing a designation of statutory agent

5

for an unlicensed foreign corporation, and therefore there

6

really is not any distinction between the letters except

7

for some speculative language that then followed in that

8

letter about what happened if there might be, might be some

9

investigation.

10

There's no guidelines for the investigation, no

11

type of format to do it, what the parameters of it were,

12

and in fact, looking at the bottom line, there was not even

13

a statement that if somehow they would comply with the

14

investigation that the Secretary of State would even ever

15

allow or recognize that registration or that designation.

16

And in fact the Court of Appeals looking at it

17

came out and correctly stated that the argument was highly

18

speculative and devoid of any statutory support.

19

no statutory support at all.

First of all, it would render the decision

6

basically moot, which this Court.has held it can't do on a

constitutional issue, and more importantly is the fact that

8

in all the cases, including Chevron, which they are so

9

fond of citing, Chevron involved the application of the

10

holding in another case, in the Rodrigue versus Aetna

11

Casualty, and interestingly enough, in that case, in

12

Rodrigue, the Court held that the plaintiffs in that case

13

would get the benefit of the holding.

14

remanded back down, and there are no cases cited where a

15

party is not entitled to the fruits of its work, and I

16

believe it would be inequitable, to say the least, to deny

17

Midwesco the benefits, and the benefits which I believe

18

it has conferred upon the people of the State of Ohio

19

as well as interstate corporations, who are always the

beneficiaries of constitutional holdings.
