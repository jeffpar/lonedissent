ORAL ARGUMENT FOR PLAINTIFF BY DUANE HOUDEK, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

6

MR. HOUDEK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

7

please the Court.

In this case the Court is called upon to

8

examine the constitutionality under the "equal protection"

9

clause of a fee charged of some North Dakota parents to bus

10

their children to school.

11

minority of districts which includes the Dickinson district,

12

where the Plaintiffs reside.

13

The fee is imposed only in a

In a majority of districts in North Dakota, busing is

14

provided to all free of charge subject to local mileage

15

limitations.

16

districts which compromise some 160 out of the 310 districts in

17

the state.

18
19

Within the Dickinson district, the fee is imposed
v,
against all sa^e handicapped or special education students

20

without exemption, without regard to ability to pay or the

21

financial status of the parents.

22

That is a statutory mandate in all of those other

The effects of these two aspects of the Dickinson

23

bussing policy and the authorizing statute come together and

24

converge in this case where a poor family, unable to pay the

25

fee, lives within one of the few districts where the fee is

permitted to be charged.

2

Paula Kadrmas, lives with her husband and three children called

3

New Hradec, North Dakota, on a farm that is some 16 miles from

4

the school their oldest daughter is designated to attend by the

5

district.

6

The parent who brought this case,

She encounters the fee at all, again, only because

7

she happens to live in that type of district.

8

any other districts, there would not be any kind of bussing fee

9

that could, by law, be charged to her.

QUESTION:

If she lived in

There are two types of school districts in

North Dakota; the Organized and the Reorganized, is that it?
MR. HOUDEK:

They've come to be known, and it's a

13

rather awkward set of terms, Justice O'Connor, Reorganized and

14

Non-reorganized.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. HOUDEK:

Organized and Non-reorganized.
And the Reorganized districts have done

17

so pursuant to statutes that were passed in the '40s to

18

encourage an economy of scale, if you would.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

And in terms of numbers of students, is it

about equally divided among the two types of districts?
MR. HOUDEK:

I think it is.

I don't have the exact

22

figures, but I think it's pretty close.

23

that the Non-reorganized districts are generally the districts

24

in the larger cities or towns and have a higher population of

25

students, than the smaller districts.

Heritage

And what that shows is

QUESTION:

1

Are the Appellants still living in the

2

same location and their circumstances have not improved, I take

3

it?
MR. HOUDEK:

4

Their circumstances have greatly

5

deteriorated.

6

paying taxes of some $2500 they had about $12,500 left for a

7

family of five.
Since that time, they have started on a cattle

QUESTION:

12

MR. HOUDEK:

13

They got a loan to try and raise some

That should be no problem.
That remains to be seen, Justice White,

until calving this spring.

14

But the point of it is that out of this money that

15

was allocated to them, prior to them getting any income at all

16

from this operation, they were given only $12,000 to live on

17

for the year, half of which inadvertently went to the former

18

landowner, so they had $6,000.

19

QUESTION:

20

access to school in fact, has she, to public school education?
MR. HOUDEK:

21
22

23

Now, Serita has not actually been denied

She has been denied access to the busing

system.
QUESTION:

My question was whether she has, for

24

purposes of this lawsuit been denied access to education, the

25

public school education.

Heritage

MR. HOUDEK:

1

2

She has not missed school because of it.

She has made it to school.

3

QUESTION:

Is there any kind of ripeness problem?

4

QUESTION:

Excuse me?

No, I don't think there is at

5

all, Your Honor, for one thing part of the challenged statutes

6

include payment of the fee or the demand for the fee, and that

7

goes on whether or not she actually made it to school or not.
QUESTION:

8
9

You would not urge, if that's all that's

left, though, you wouldn't urge any heightened scrutiny on the

10

requirement to pay a bus fare, as you do of the ability to go

11

to school?
MR. HOUDEK:

12
13

would not.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. HOUDEK:

16

It's ordinary protection analysis?
Yes.

I believe, implicit in my analysis

there is more left than that, Your Honor.

17
18

No, if that was all that was left, we

QUESTION:

Well, what?

Her folks took her to school?

They drove her to school, didn't they?

19

MR. HOUDEK:

They did.

20

What happened there, Chief Justice Rehnquist, because

21

of a North Dakota case decided in the North Dakota Supreme

22

Court.

23

one of these busing contracts that are frequently used, or were

24

used in the Bismark district, at any rate, then they could not

25

challenge the constitutionality of having to pay that fee.

The court stated that if anybody signed a contract,

6

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

And

1

so the plaintiffs in Dickinson, once the District was adamant

2

about demanding them to sign such a contract, were put in a

3

position that if they did so, they would not have been able to

4

bring their case in state court.

5

So they were left with that on one side; the

6

compulsory attendance laws of North Dakota on the other side,

7

forcing them to in some manner get their children to school,

8

and the only thing left was to drive them themselves.

9
10

11

QUESTION:

Mr. Houdek, do you lose your case unless

the Court applies some form of heightened scrutiny?
MR. HOUDEK:

No, no, Justice O'Connor, I don't

12

believe that's true at all.

13

court has stated that even under the minimum rational basis

14

test of equal protection, it is looking when there are rights

15

that are important,

16

are rights that have been called by this Court important to the

17

fabric of our society, and to all the political processes that

18

citizens need to engage in.

QUESTION:

Maybe at that time you will have a

10

different lawsuit, but it seems to me now she's been deprived

11

of bus transportation because she couldn't pay for it.

12

that raises an obvious equal protection problem.

13

hasn't been deprived of going to school, has she?

14

MR. HOUDEK:

Now

But she

No, Your Honor, she has not.

She has

15

gone to school.

16

this transportation scheme in North Dakota is part and parcel

17

of the education system, and not merely some benefit like a

18

band uniform might be or something else.

MR. HOUDEK:

Yes.
Here this is not a user fee situation,

Justice O'Connor.
QUESTION:

You don't think a little charge for

transportation is a user fee in a sense?
MR. HOUDEK:

No.

And here's what I think is the

7

fundamental difference.

8

state gives someone and someone can apply for it or not.

9

A driver's license is a privilege the

Here attendance at school —

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. HOUDEK:

But desperately important, is it not?
It is important.

Granted.

But

attendance at school, and at school, not education in your

13

home, but attendance at school in

15

16

charge, and that has been a historical tradition in North

17

Dakota, so much so that the compulsory education laws were not

19

whom the district did not provide transportation.

North Dakota, is compulsory.

So it is more than simply a benefit that one might
avail themselves of.
QUESTION:

What about this statute in North Dakota

23

that says "No students rights or privileges shall be denied for

24

non-payment of fees?"

25

MR. HOUDEK:

Yes, if I may answer that from a couple

9

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

of different approaches:

2

construed to say whether or not it would include

3

transportation.
QUESTION:

4
5

first, that has not been judicially

Have you argued that it does include

transportation?
MR. HOUDEK:

6

We brought this waiver statute to the

7

attention of the trial court and to the other side,as a matter

8

of fact.

9
10
11

No one has ever -QUESTION:

Do you take the position that the statute

protects your client from the payment of the fee?
MR. HOUDEK:

That has never been established that it

12
13

QUESTION:

14

MR. HOUDEK:

Do you take the position that it does?
I would say, Your Honor, that if that

15

statute is so-construed, that that would go a long way to

16

resolving the constitutional problems that are here.

17

QUESTION:

Yes, I suppose you certainly would want to

18

argue that it covers your client, if you have any interest in

19

protecting them at all.

20

MR. HOUDEK:

Certainly so, certainly so.

If as the

21

Appellees have seemed to indicate, that that statute takes care

22

of the entire problem, yet it is more than a little curious

23

that that statute has been raised by them for the first time in

24

this Court after some two years of litigation.

25

QUESTION:

That doesn't take care of the entire

10

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

1

program.

You're not saying it takes care of the entire — you

2

still have an equal protection problem that people in some

3

counties have to pay for the busses, you know, --

4

MR. HOUDEK:

5

QUESTION:

That's right.

But I —

-- up to the point where you're below the

6

absolute poverty line that you can't possibly get to school.

7

You'd still be disadvantaged as regards everybody else in the

8

state.

9

MR. HOUDEK:

That's right.

I interpreted the

10

question, Your Honor, as it would apply to our clients.

11

would be covered by such a statute because they would certainly

12

fall within those whose privileges or educational opportunities

13

would be taken away because of a lack of an ability to pay.

14

And if the statute prohibits that, then they would be covered.

15

It does not, as you suggest, cover any kind of geographical

16

disparity that exists within the state.

17

QUESTION:

They

I don't think Justice O'Connor was asking

18

you to concede or to asking your position as to whether your

19

clients qualify under this statute if it's interpreted the way

20

your opponents say it should be.

21

qualify under it, are you?

22

MR. HOUDEK:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. HOUDEK:

25

You're not sure they would

Yes, Your Honor.
You are?
All I could say to that is that someone

with their income and their family composition does not

11

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

qualify, then that statute would not be protecting their

2

children.

3
4

QUESTION:

Then you're right, the case is gone if

that statute's interpreted, though.
MR. HOUDEK:

5

Well, it's interesting:

all along, it

6

seems, the Appellees have

7

this case; we have

8

noblesse oblige, but if in fact they are saying that statute

9

applies, and if they will say that that is the law in North

said "There's no need for a waiver in

one in the statute.

We do this as kind of a

10

Dakota, that they will not deny a student access to that bus

11

system if they haven't an ability to pay, and they will not

12

attempt to collect

from a parent as an ability to pay the fee

13

that may otherwise

may be involved, then we're a long way

14

towards settling this case.
But up to this point, that has never been done.

15
16

They

have never been willing to admit that.
QUESTION:

17

This statute doesn't say anything about

18

inability to pay, does it?

19

that what -- are we talking about the statutes quote on page

20

29?

21

MR. HOUDEK:

22

QUESTION:

23

It says, "Nonpayment of fees."

Is

Yes, Your Honor.
It doesn't say anything about inability to

pay-

24

MR. HOUDEK:

25

QUESTION:

No.

It does say that —

It doesn't say anything about bussing.

12

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

It

1

says, "Rights are -- " if it means you shall not be denied the

2

right to get on the bus because you don't pay the fees, if you

3

read it that way, why hasn't she been riding the bus all these

4

years ?
MR. HOUDEK:

5
6

If that statute meant

that, then she should have never been turned down.

7

MR. HOUDEK:

8

QUESTION:

9

That's right.

Seems to me that's rather strange.
I assume there's no way to read this in

such a way that it would remove the liability for the fees.

10

All it means is you have to get this particular student to

11

school, or I presume her parents would continue to be liable

12

for the fees which the school could try to collect from them,

13

or the state could if and when the state had sufficient funds.
MR. HOUDEK:

14

Yes, absolutely.

But I think in that

15

way it's analogous, perhaps to providing indigent counsel and

16

then trying to recoup that if the person thereafter comes into

17

funds.

I agree.

18

I believe in --

19

QUESTION:

Let me just clear up one other thing in my

20

mind:

they have said that they won't let her ride on the bus

21

not only because she doesn't pay the money, but she has to sign

22

this contract?

23

MR. HOUDEK:

24

QUESTION:

25

She's got to

--

Right.
So that this statute wouldn't cure that.

and that contract required her to waive the

13

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

kind of claim she asserts in this case?

2

MR. HOUDEK:

Right, so it's a real catch-22.

If they

3

maintain that position, then they would never know whether they

4

would get into a situation where the statute pertained.

5

And I might add, that refusal to sign the contract

6

has been characterized as something that was done to, like our

7

clients thought it up to maintain standing.

8

the -- for the very reason that, if they did it, they couldn't

9

challenge any of the fees.

10

It was demanded of

It came from exactly the other way

around.
To summarize that point, if I might, I think everyone

11
12

here involved in this case and the Court below, recognized the

13

essential nature of transportation to education in North Dakota

14

where we have these very large districts and centralized

15

schools and a rural population.

16

dissent below did; the Appellees seem to concede.

17

QUESTION:

I mean, the majority did; the

As I understand your argument, though, if

18

North Dakota didn't furnish bus transportation to anyone in

19

order to get to school, you would say that that -- practice was

20

unconstitutional as with respect to poor people?
MR. HOUDEK:

21

Yes.

I think, of course, Justice White,

22

that this Court, because of the circumstances of this case need

23

not go nearly so far.

24
25

QUESTION:

Your argument here, that's your principal

argument.

Heritage

14
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

MR. HOUDEK:

2

QUESTION:

3

Our argument is that —
Your principal argument is about poor

people.

4

MR. HOUDEK:

5

QUESTION:

Yes, it is also about -I suppose your equal protection argument

6

would be just as good with respect to the difference between

7

Reorganized and Non-reorganized districts -- if there weren't

8

any poor people, I suppose somebody who could afford to drive

9

their child to school could make it just as good an equal

10

protection claim as you could with respect to the difference

11

between the districts.

12

MR. HOUDEK:

That's correct.

I believe that's true.

13

But again, I don't think any decision of this Court

14

would have to rest on that ground alone because our clients

15

clearly fall within however you might define poor people.

16

QUESTION:

That may be so, but if we rely on that,

17

then we would have to be saying that North Dakota is

18

constitutionally required to furnish bus transportation to poor

19

people, who have no way for their children to get to school.

20

MR. HOUDEK:

I think what it would -- that 's a fair

21

characterization, Your Honor.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. HOUDEK:

I think it is, too.
That would come in to play if within the

24

context of the present system, where were they compel

25

attendance to school, where that is mandatory; where if there's

Heritage

15
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

someone 20 miles from the school they provide who has

2

absolutely no way of getting in there -QUESTION:

3

Is there any evidence that North Dakota

4

has ever prosecuted anyone under the truancy statute who was

5

simply unable to afford the bus to school and therefore did not

6

come?

7

MR. HOUDEK:

That there is -- it's not recently, Your

8

Honor.

9

issue and people keeping them back for because of their choice

10
11

Recently, the cases have taken on a home-school kind of

in education.
But there has been at least one case where the North

12

Dakota court has held that where a person was offered only a

13

$.50 per day transportation allowance and not actually brought

14

to school could not be subject to prosecution for compulsory

15

attendance.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

QUESTION:
in North Dakota?

20

truancy statute?

22

23

I don't think you said,

"could not be?"

19

21

Could not be?

Is there any case ever holding otherwise

I mean, are there many prosecutions under the

MR. HOUDEK:

In the context you mean, I am not aware

there are a lot, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

So what's really at issue is what you say

24

is the denial of the right to public school education, not the

25

dilemma that you're going to be prosecuted for truancy if you

Heritage

16
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

cannot afford to go on the bus?

2

MR. HOUDEK:

While I agree that the denial of the

3

public school education is an extremely important factor, and

4

denial of such a right does raise these constitutional issues.

5

I think that the part about compulsory attendance merely brings

6

it into finer focus.

7

education is so important you've got to get there; you've to do

8

it in our schools; we're going to give transportation to most

9

of the districts, but we're going to withhold some.

I mean, here's a state that's saying

And we're

10

going to do from the poor within those districts as well,

11

without any kind of a waiver situation, because that's the way

12

it has been applied.

13

I believe the appellees can say all they want that

14

informally they will do this or they will do that; but unless

15

our clients have some legal guarantee, it's an empty promise.

16

The administrations change; circumstances and people change,

17

and unless it is backed up by some active legal significance, I

18

don't think that promise is enough.

19
20
21

22

I would like to reserve the rest of my time at this

This

matter of charging a fee actually, although it is a state law,

4

did originate in Dickinson back in 1973 and it was a plebicite

5

of the bus uses that it came about.

6

Prior to that it was a practice of picking up the

7

children at the main road which could mean a half-mile or a

8

mile or a quarter of a mile; and the bus patrons said we would

rather pay a

that didn't cost anything.

They said we'd

10

rather pay a fee if you'll come to our yard and pick up the

11

children and return them there in the afternoon. So that is

12

what happened and that's what is still going on.
Subsequent to that, actually, the law was passed in

It's a matter of lining up during the

QUESTION:

Yes.
And the supreme court apparently found

that the statute authorizing bus fees in non-reorganized school

MR. DYNES:

I think we have to take that in two

We now have this scheme on the books and

MR. DYNES:

QUESTION:

1
2

Now what is the legitimate governmental

purpose now, do you suppose, in that difference?
MR. DYNES:

3

That as the reorganization has been

4

completed, the plans are in place; they've been voted on in the

5

individual districts and the legislature when they passed this

6

fee statute, simply left those districts alone because they had

those plans in place, with not charging any fees.

MR. DYNES:

QUESTION:

12

It's been suggested that

That's correct

Your Honor.

Is the district simply left free to decide

whether or not they will charge a fee?

13

MR. DYNES:

QUESTION:

That's true.
It's not as if the state says you will

charge a fee to some districts and you won't to others, and

16

with the districts that aren't reorganized, they are left a

17

local option?

18

MR. DYNES:

They are left a local option and the

19

statutes are completely silent on whether or not they could

charge a fee.

But the other districts either have the option of

having the bussing plan of any kind, and they also have the

option of charging a fee or not within the limitation, of

from school they require people to live in order to take

advantage of the system.

QUESTION:

In your view, so far as the North Dakota

MR. SPAETH:

13

Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Court:

The reorganization statute which was passed by the

20

encourage reorganization, and it did encourage reorganization

in the vast majority of school districts in this state.

would be a mistake to examine it solely in the context of

you simply can't trust the government when it promises things.

And now you say that some reorganized and some didn't,

but those that didn't reorganize are functionally just like

those that -- the problem that the legislature was concerned

with -- some distant families not near enough to the school to

get there without free bus transportation.

11

That's the problem.
MR. SPAETH:

12

What happened here, Justice Stevens, is

13

there was a very rational scheme was put in place given the

14

needs of the state as a whole, and you're focusing on the

15

Dickinson school district, where it isn't.
QUESTION:

16

No.

I'm focusing on what the legislature

17

was concerned about when it said, if you get yourself in this

18

particular structure with a central school and people living a

19

long ways away from it, we'll take care of you.

20

take care of a similar set of circumstances in another

21

district.

22

But we won't

What's the justification for that?
MR. SPAETH:

Because when the legislature was

23

considering this problem, the legislature emerged from a

24

political compromise and realized that, in order to provide

25

some districts with an incentive to reorganize, it was going to

have to put in some guarantee that transportation would be

provided.

3

going to reorganize, because generally -- of course, not in

4

every case -- but generally there wasn't the same

5

transportation problem; that the students would live close

6

enough to their school where they wouldn't need free

7

transportation.
QUESTION:

It didn't need that same incentive if they weren't

What you are saying is that the

legislature had no intention whatever to benefit people distant

10

from the schools; it just wanted to eliminate a possible

11

obstacle to their voting for reorganization?

12

13

votes ?
MR. SPAETH:

14

It has no

It was just wanted to get their

The primary focus was to encourage this

15

process of consolidation, and in order to get this legislation

16

through, that important protection had to be put in to

17

encourage the consolidation process, and that's what we're

18

talking about here.

19

Now, there's one other issue that troubles the court,

20

and I want to talk about it, and that is, how did this case get

21

here?

22

is whether a state may deny equal access to education to a

23

distinct class of people, basically minor people whose parents

24

are below the poverty level; I don't think on the record here

out of locally imposed taxes?

So that the people who don't pay bussing

MR. SPAETH:

Yes, that's correct.

But that's what

10

we're faced with -- $97.00 a year, which is a user fee levied

11

in one county that's at issue here against a background of a

12

system that really did what it was supposed to do, which was to

13

encourage the reorganization of most of North Dakota schools.

14

We're the most agricultural state in the United

15

States; we're not a rich state by any means; and we're seeing

16

what's happening all over the upper Midwest; and that is a

17

shrinking of the rural population, even out of the small towns

18

into the larger cities.

And that's what's driven this whole process.

It's

largely complete at this point, but this program I think has

worked well.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY DUANE HOUDEK, ESQ.

25

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS — REBUTTAL

Heritage

44
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

MR. HOUDEK:

1

I would first like to point out that the

2

concept of reorganization did not create the right to bussing

3

in North Dakota.

4

And the reorganization statutes then created that right.

It is not as though there was no bussing.

Bussing existed long before 1947 when the

5
6

reorganization statutes were passed.

7

the statutes did was to ensure that that tradition would

8

continue.

9

QUESTION:

But did free bussing exist before?

MR. HOUDEK:

10

As a matter of fact, what

Yes, Your Honor.

Older cases have said

11

that this very statute that gave an option of providing

12

transportation or making in lieu payments, although they were

13

discretionary in which you did, they were mandatory that you

14

did one or the other.

15
16
17

So that has nothing to do with the reorganization
statute.
Secondly, this is not a local option case.

This is

18

not a Rodriguez "difference in quality of education."

19

Justice Stevens pointed out, these are mostly state funds, and

20

it's more than 2/3rds.

21

funds are state monies that are being distributed to the

22

various districts.

MR. HOUDEK:

3

Yes.

That the 2/3rds of the

That's true, but withholding it

4

from a person who doesn't pay it, withholding all that state

5

benefit, is not something that a local option ought to be able

6

to do.
QUESTION:

7
8

I suppose you could say you could offer to

take 2/3rds of it away with the school, would you?
MR. HOUDEK:

9

No, I wouldn't, Your Honor.

What I'm

10

saying is that it's even worse that this fee could deny those

11

people all of the state benefit as well.

12

from that, they don't pay the same percentage in every

13

district; the formula is the same; the state funding of

14

transportation formula is based on whether you use a small or a

15

large bus; and the number of pupil days.

2

MR. HOUDEK:

No.

It is like other parts of

education; people pay taxes and fund it whether they have

4

children or not because education is important to our society

5

as a whole.

6

I see that in that fashion.
