ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN T. BAINE, ESQ.

Q

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BAINE:

10

1.1
12

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case is before the Court for review of a final

13

judgment of civil contempt against the two National

14

Organizations of Catholic Bishops.

15

contention that the contempt judgment against them is void

16

because that judgment, and the underlying orders, were beyond

17

the constitutional power of the District Court.

18

It is the Bishops'

The facts can be stated simply.

The Respondents

19

brought suit seeking an order directing the Commissioner of

20

Internal Revenue to revoke the tax-exemption of the Catholic

2 .1

Church in the United States on the ground that the Church had

22

allegedly engaged in impermissible political activities in the

23

area of abortion.

24

The Respondents served subpoena duces tecum upon the

OA K'

Bishops, and the Bishops moved to quash those subpoenas on the
3
Heritage Reporting Corporation

ground, among others, that the Court was without power to issue

i
2

them.

Without power because the Plaintiffs lacking standing to

3

bring a lawsuit challenging the tax-exemption of the Church.

4

Without power, in other words, because there was no case or

5

controversy before the Court.

G

The District Court denied the motion and later held

7

the Bishops in contempt when they declined to comply with the

8

subpoenas.

9

the Plaintiffs had standing to bring the suit.
The Court of Appeals affirmed the contempt judgment

10

&

11

without deciding the issue of standing.

13

court; he may only raise a limited challenge that there is no

questions.

Whether a witness and an alleged contemnor may

17

challenge the Article III Power of the Court to Act, and, if

10

so, whether the District Court in this case was without power

1.9

because the Plaintiffs lacking standing to bring the suit.

It held that a non-

Court because that power is being invoked against him.

A witness who is subpoenaed and

this case are themselves elements of. the Article III Power of

the Court., They don't exist independently.

2

the judicial power that is conferred by Article III, and as

3

this Court said in United States v. Morton Salt, the subpoena

4

power is therefore subject to the limitations of Article III.

5

What that means --

6

QUESTION:

They are part of

Mr. Baine, certainly there's language in

7

Blair v. United States, as you know, that it certainly cuts

R

against your position.

q

MR. BAINE:

Blair v. United States is a case that

10

concerns the subpoena power of the Grand Jury, and what the

11

Court held in that case is that one who is subpoenaed to appear

12

before a grand jury cannot object on the ground that the

I3

criminal statute that he believes is the subject of the

14

investigation is unconstitutional.

I 5

speculative and premature.

i6

That kind of a challenge is

A grand jury's subpoena power, unlike the subpoena

17

power of a court in a civil case, does not depend upon the

10

existence of a case or controversy, and, in fact, in a case of

19

the grand jury, as the Court said in Blair, the grand jury and

20

the court don't even know whether there's a matter within the

21

jurisdiction of the federal courts until the end of the

22

investigation.

Z.*

In a civil case, on the other hand, the complaint is

24

at the beginning of the case.

25

beginning of the case whether there is jurisdiction, whether

One can determine at the

5

Heritage Reporting Corporation

there is a case in controversy.
So,

it's our contention that Blair simply has no

relevance to this case, and, in fact, when Blair says that the
witness may not challenge the jurisdiction, it is referring to
the jurisdiction of the grand jury and the court to
investigate, and to bring a case within the jurisdiction of the
court if it finds that a violation has occurred.
QUESTION:

Mr. Baine, if the case were one in which

the burden on the witness was minimal rather than the greater
burden that you allege in this case for these witnesses, do you
think that any witness should be able to make the same
jurisdictional challenge, regardless of the burden on the
witness ?
MR. BAINE:

There's no question that the burden in

this case was substantial and we certainly rely upon that fact.
However, the contention is that the Court has no power to act
at all if there is no case or controversy, and if there's no
case or controversy,

it has no power to do anything relating to

the merits of the case.
QUESTION:

Well, so,

is your answer to me yes,

regardless of the extent of the burden any witness in any
circumstance should be able to make this kind of a challenge?
MR. BAINE:

Yes, that is my answer.

I would add, of

course, that in our view, the subpoena here was not only
unlawful because it was without judicial power, but it was also
6

•

'

unduly burdensome, and if you wanted to look at it as a matter
of whether the subpoena is unduly burdensome, certainly you

QUESTION:

Well, the Court's got the power to decide

its own jurisdiction and do something until somebody reverses

it, doesn't it?

could consider the burden that is placed upon the witness.

MR. BAINE:

There's no question the Court has power

I think that that's where the

Court of Appeals went wrong.

12

must have power to enter those orders that are necessary to

enable it to decide the question of jurisdiction.

MR. BAINE:

As a general matter, a court must

And to go forward with the case until it's

Go forward with the case until it's

17

reversed in the sense that a party may not question

18

jurisdiction, but the critical point here is that as far as the

19

Bishops were concerned, there was a final judgment entered as

20

to them, and this Court has held over and over that a judgment

21

aqainst -- of contempt against a non-party witness is a final

22

judgment and the witness is entitled to appeal it immediately

23

before undertaking any burden of compliance.

24

The Court has also held that a non-party contemnor

25

may, on review, have a full review of his claims, and if the
7
Heritage Reporting Corporation

Court -- if a non-party contemnor is entitled to a full review

m
9

of his claims, certainly he must be entitled to review of the

3

very basic contention that there was no power at all to

4

subpoena him.

Jr
6

QUESTION:

What did the Court of Appeals do?

7

MR. BAINE:

party witness may not challenge the Article III Power of the

9

District Court, and that is where we say the Court of Appeals
committed error.

l J.
12

QUESTION:

Well, they said something about

jurisdiction.
MR. BAINE:

13

What they said is that the witness may

14

raise the limited challenge that there is no colorable

15

jurisdiction.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. BAINE:

1R
19

T

Why did they say that?
Well, I don't know why they said it, but

think I know where the error occurred.
QUESTION:

If they said that, they would have to --

20

it would be proper for them to redecide the merits of the

71

jurisdictional question.

•>/. 1/.

*

The Court of Appeals said that the non-

8

10

*

Well, do you -- what are you attacking?

MR. BAINE:

T think there's no question, once you

9 >

start looking at jurisdiction, there's no reason not to decide

24

the question outright.

25

I think what the Court of Appeals did is it took
8
Heritage Reporting Corporation

limited exception to the principle that a court must have power
to act.

That exception being the court necessarily has power

to decide its power, and if it can't make a decision on
jurisdiction right away, it can issue an order as in United
Mine Workers to preserve the status quo, pending a decision on
jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

What would the Court of Appeals have done

if it had found there's no colorable jurisdiction?
MR. BAINE:

It would have reversed and found that the

contempt judgment was invalid.
QUESTION:

Were there any efforts to define what

colorable was?
MR. BAINE:
defined it at all.

Well, I don't think the Court of Appeals
The Court just said in one paragraph that

we think there's a colorable claim here.
QUESTION:
MR. BAINE:

What do you think they meant by colorable?
I'm not sure what they meant. I think

that the concept has some meaning if the Court doesn't have all
the information before it to enable it to decide the question,
when you have all the information before you, I don't know what
colorable jurisdiction means.
This subpoena, these subpoenas, were not issued to
secure evidence relating to the question of jurisdiction.

In

fact, the District Court had already decided that it had
jurisdiction, and, so, we say that the issue on appeal wasn't
9

Heritage Reporting Corporation

whether the District Court had colorable jurisdiction to decide

m
*7
/L

its actual jurisdiction.

5)

Court was correct in deciding that it had actual jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

4

of Appeals should have decided the jurisdictional issue

6

straight out, would we just remand and let them decide

7

jurisdiction?
MR. BAINE:

That would be an option before the Court.

y

I would suggest, however, that the jurisdictional issue in this

10

case is not a novel one, and that the Court really doesn't need

11

the guidance of the Court of Appeals on it.
The Court has addressed the question in several

12
13

cases.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. BAINE:

16

QUESTION:

But it would save us a lot of work.
It would, indeed.

It would, indeed.

Ordinarily, if we disagree with their

1.7

standards, say they have another one to apply, don't we usually

let them apply it first?
MR. BAINE:

19

ft

What if we agree with you that the Court

5

B

^

The issue is whether the District

I think, quite frankly, the Court has

20

done it both ways, and certainly the Court could either remand

21

for a full decision by the Court of Appeals on the question of

•> ->
/. /■

jurisdiction or it could go ahead and decide the question

9 9

itself.

24
25

Now, the Respondents' main argument in this Court on
the question -- on the first issue, is that a non-party witness
10
Heritaae Reporting Corporation

1

can't raise a jurisdictional challenge on appeals.
it's interlocutory.

Somehow

This, I think, is simply wrong.

5)

This Court has held for at least eighty years now

4

that a final judgment of civil contempt against a non-party

5

witness is immediately appealable and that the contemnor is

6

entitled to a full review of his claims.

7

What the Respondents say is that the Bishops could

f!

have argued on appeal that the contempt judgment was invalid

9

because the subpoenas were unduly burdensome, that it cost too

10

much to xerox the documents, or that it would take too many man

11

hours to search for the documents, but they say that we can't

12

raise on appeal the more fundamental question whether or not

13

the subpoenas were invalid all together because they were

14

beyond the power of a District Court.

15

What that overlooks is that the first issue on any

16

appeal is the question of jurisdiction or power, not just of

17

the Court of Appeals, but of the District Court.

10

The appeal in this case is really no different from

19

any other appeal in that respect.

70

obligation to satisfy itself that the District Court had power

2 I

to act and that the District Court was correct when it found

-> 7

that it did have power to act.

23

QUESTION:

The Court of Appeals had an

Well, is lack of standing as

24

quintessentially jurisdictional as, say, the absence of subject

25

matter jurisdiction?
11

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. BAINE:

1

standing is.

Certainly, the absence of Article III

There are also elements of standing that are

->

prudential in nature, but this Court has held over and over

4

again that in the absence of Article III standing, there is no

s

case or controversy, and that, indeed, there is no more

fi

fundamental element of Article III power than the existence of

7

standing.

5)
')
10

And, so, we say that this is a quintessential Article
IIT issue that the Court must satisfy itself on.
QUESTION:

what case of ours comes closest to

1!

supporting that particular proposition, that lack of Article

12

III standing is just like lack of, say, subject matter

13

jurisdiction?

14

MR. BAINE:

Well, I think in Valley Forge, what the

15

Court in Americans United v. Valley Forge was the Court said is

16

that Article III standing -- that without Article III standing,

17

a plaintiff may not litigate in the federal courts, that it is

18

an essential ingredient of the Court's Article III Power, that

10

in the absence of Article III standing, there simply is no case

20

or controversy.

2J

One final point on the first question.

If the

nn

Bishops can't raise their jurisdictional challenge in the Court

/£n w'■)

of Appeals, then they can never raise it at all because they

24

are not parties. There will never be another final judgment

25

against the Bishops that they can appeal.

You can get review of some extreme discovery

MR. BAINE:

Well, I suppose that they could, but I

of the Court's cases, that at some point, one must be able to

have a right of appeal from the final judgment against you.

point, we'll let you challenge the sanction.

MR. BAINE:

Well, you could say that because you are

BAINE:

would be,

1906, Alexander v. The United States in the same year, United

1.0

in a sense, overruling Nelson v. United States in

States v.

Ryan a number of years later.

j. i

In all of these cases,

the Court has held that a non-

1.2

party contemnor is entitled to an immediate appeal of the final

1.3

judgment of contempt entered against him.
Now,

.14

the rule is different for party contemnors.

The

1.5

rule is quite clear in a number of the Court's decisions.

1.6

a non-party who is held in contempt has an immediate right of

17

appeal whereas a party does not because a party will be

1.0

involved in other judgments that he can then appeal.

1.9

But the non-party's only opportunity is now.

BAINE:

The issue in Blair was a little

The problem of Blair wasn't that the witness

14
Heritage Reporting Corporation

wouldn't have had another chance to get review of his claim.
The problem in Blair was that the witness didn't have a claim.
The witness can't say -QUESTION:

He claimed that the grand jury had no

power to act because they were investigating a crime that was
not authorized by federal law.

The basic federal law was

unconstitutional, but I don't think your argument about Blair
would be any different if the witness had said the grand jury
is improperly constituted or something like that.
MR. BAINE:

Of course, the holding in Blair wasn't

that the witness had no right to review.

The holding in Blair

was that he was in contempt and he had no defense to the
contempt charge, that there was no comparable argument.
QUESTION:

Well, his defense was the grand jury --

his defense was very similar to the one here.

The grand jury

had no power to ask the questions that it wanted to ask.
MR. BAINE:

And in the context of the grand jury,

that simply isn't a defense because one cannot say -QUESTION:

But once you say that, you're saying you

can never make this argument, and I'm just saying to the extent
you're relying on the fact that this issue is never reviewable,
that argument could also have been made in Blair.

That's kind

of a practical argument rather than a legal argument.
MR. BAINE:

Yes.

The argument could have been made

in Blair, but, of course, Blair did get review of the contempt
15

judgment and the decision was the contempt judgment was valid

because the jurisdictional objection that he raised was without

merit, and what we're saying is that this is an entirely-

at all, no power to subpoena the Bishops, and if there was no

power to subpoena them, they didn't have to obey the subpoena,

10

and if they didn't have to obey it, they couldn't be held in

contempt for disobeying.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN I. HOROWITZ, ESQ.
FEDERAL RESPONDENTS SUPPORTING PETITIONERS
MR. HOROWITZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

16
Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

the Court:

nz

I plan to devote ray time to the issue that is of most

.

3

concern to the Federal Government, the underlying question of

4

whether the Plaintiffs have standing to bring this suit against

5

the Internal Revenue Service, seeking to compel us to revoke

6

the tax-exemption of a third party.
That standing issue raises a general problem that the

7
8

Court has confronted on several occasions in recent years.

9

Namely,

the circumstances under which the federal courts may be

1.0

asked to review the workings of the Executive Branch by a party

11

who is not directly affected by government actions.

1.2

,

The basic principle in these cases is that the

43

Plaintiffs have standing to challenge executive action only

14

when they have suffered a concrete injury thereby, and one

15

principle that the Court has made clear time and time again is

16

that the courts will not entertain challenges brought by

17

citizens whose interest is no more than a generalized interest

18

in having the Government obey or enforce the law.

48

In the words of this Court, the federal judiciary is

20

not an ombudsman of the general welfare.

24

act as a continuing monitor of the wisdom and soundness of

no

executive actions.

/.

It is not designed to

In our view, the injury that is claimed here is so
24

theoretical and abstract that acceptance of it would almost

25

completely obliterate this principle that limits judicial

17
Heritage Reporting Corporation

monitoring of the Executrve
Executive Branch. It would expose the

*
2

Government to untold numbers of.suits by interested but not

3

affected persons who seek to challenge its day-to-day execution

4

of the laws.
e

5

Specifically, we think the claim of injury here is

6

considerably weaker than the claims of injury that have been

7

asserted to underlie standing in recent cases that the Court

R

has rejected standing.

')
10

QUESTION:
claimed injury here?

MR. HOROWITZ:

11

i

Well, the claimed injury in this case,

12

basically the gist of it, is that there has been government

13

favoritism, that the government -- that the Catholic Church has

14

violated the prerequisites for having a Section 501(c)(3) tax-

15

exemption and, yet, the government has failed to take away that
tax-exemption.

16

17

Therefore, this failure to enforce the law by the

10

government as somehow favori-tism towards an entity with whom

19

the Plaintiffs disagree and that favoritism necessarily injures

20

them.

MR. BEIL:

It's just

o

|

First of all, it's

24
25

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
Threshold question for determination by this Court is
25
Heritage Reporting Corporation

what issues are properly raised on this appeal.
Petitioners here seek an unprecedented exemption from
the rule against interlocutory appeals, which is the
fundamental principle of federal appellate jurisdiction.

To

raise issues that no contemnor has ever been permitted to raise
on appeal.
It is to be remembered that the Petitions are
appealing from a contempt order, not a final judgment on the
merits.

Yet, the Petitioners, who are non-party witnesses,

legally strangers to the lawsuit, do not raise any issues
related to the subpoena or to the contempt order themselves.
QUESTION:
isn't it, Mr. Beil?
MR. BEIL:

Yet, it is a final judgment as to them,
Adjudicating them in contempt?
Yes, it is, and, but it's -- in order to

determine what issues can be raised from that "final judgment",
one should look at the cases that allow appeals from this
determination.
The fact that it's a final determination does not
mean -- doesn't flow from that fact that the Petitioners can
raise any issue that would lead to the dismissal of the
lawsuit, which would, therefore, obviate the need for any
testimony.
QUESTION:

Mr. Beil, in theory, they don't care about

the dismissal of the lawsuit.

They may be strangers to the

lawsuit, but they're not strangers to the contempt citation.
26

Heritage Reporting Corporation

That has come down upon them.
Would you be making the same argument if the Court
had imposed criminal contempt instead of civil contempt?
Suppose the Court had said, you know, you don't give us the
document, off to jail?
MR. BEIL:

Well, —

QUESTION:

Now, you know, we do have a thing called

habeas corpus.

Are you saying that even though the Court has

no authority, no jurisdiction, there's no case of controversy,
there is no way for that person to get out of jail until the
lawsuit is completed?
MR. BEIL.:

No.

First of all, it's not true that the

Court has no jurisdiction here.
QUESTION:

Well, but that's the basis that they want

to -- on which they want to challenge it.
MR. BEIL:

The Court makes a determination.

District

Court makes a determination of jurisdiction. That determination
is binding on all parties who, or anybody that comes into the
lawsuit, until reversed on a proper appeal.
This appeal is not the kind of appeal that raises
jurisdictional issues.

It raises -- it's allowed as an appeal

because it raises issues that are independent from the main
action but are personal to the contemnors, which would be lost
if you had to -QUESTION:

So, even though you are perfectly correct
27

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

that the Court has no jurisdiction and that is ultimately

o

determined to be the case on appeal, there is no way that you
can make that vindication until the case is decided, so you

4

have to spend however many years it is in jail until the other

5

lawsuit finally concludes?
MR. BEIL:

6

That's the result.

I think that -- well, this Court has made

7

a distinction between civil contempt and criminal contempt.

n

The criminal contempt condition stands apart from the main

l

action and is treated like any other criminal action.
So, I think if there are criminal contempt for a non-

1.0
li

party witness, they could probably raise the jurisdictional

1.2

issues.

13

-- the issues that can be raised on appeal from civil contempt

14

order are different and much more limited than those that can

15

be raised from, I think, an appeal from a criminal contempt

But civil contempt is within the action and it raises

25

34

Heritage Reporting Corporation

You're not just
If

1

MR. BEIL:

That is right.

We're saying, essentially,

2

that as a third party witness, the issue of jurisdiction -- he

3

takes the court as he finds it, the determination by the

4

District Court of its jurisdiction is a determination that the

5

District Court has the right to make and that simply is not

6

reversible.

7

The injury that the non-party witness has been called

8

forth to produce that evidence suffers, which is compliance

9

with a public duty to produce documents, doesn't give rise to

10

an appealable injury on the jurisdictional issue because, if it

11

does,

12

jurisdictional issues would have to be automatically

13

appealable.

it would mean that any denial of a motion to dismiss on

14

15

I don't think this Court -- this Court has certainly
never held that.

J.6

Also, if you hold that, however, the possibility of

17

not only repeated appeals, because, after all, each witness

18

that comes forward and is subpoenaed and doesn't produce

19

documents can raise the issue again because he's not -- there's

20

been no res judicata, you also have the possibility of

'2 1

inconsistent rulings by different District Courts and different

22

circuits around the country, because a witness can only be

23

subpoenaed in his home state, in his home district,

24

and can raise any challenges to that subpoena in his home

25

district.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

in fact,

1

So, if you had a case, as this is like the case may

'■>

involve, you have witnesses here in Washington, maybe witnesses

3

elsewhere in the country, it could raise a jurisdictional issue

4

in another District Court and a second circuit, another

5

circuit, would be looking at it, and you would have

6

inconsistent -- conceivably have inconsistent rulings by

7

different courts on the same issue in the same case that could

8

not be resolved by this Court.

3

QUESTION:

1 0

I assume if the appeals are frivolous,

there could be sanctions against the witness?
MR. BEIL:

1 1

Yes, but may not necessarily be frivolous

12

appeals, and certainly a decision by one district or one

]3

circuit is not binding on a determination by another circuit.

14

So that the issue can be raised in a different circuit without

15

being frivolous or somehow improper.

16

I would like to turn now to the other issue in the case,

17

which is the question of standing.

this Court should reach the issue of standing because the --

MR. BEIL:

19

of Appeals was doing that.

20

was recognizing is that jurisdictional determinations are not

21

appealable, but you can bring a mandamus petition to challenge

on

a usurpation of power, and that this was the jurisdictional

23

challenge here was the equivalent of a mandamus petition

used the term "usurpation of power", which indicates to me that

it was, in fact, applying a mandamus standard here.

But if you decide there was no Article III

MR. BEIL:

I guess it comes back to the question of

the District Court has jurisdiction to determine jurisdiction,
anrl that determination, Respondents suggest, remains
unassailable until appeal of a final judgment.
If the District Court has usurped power, has done -gone so far that this Court or the Court of Appeals would grant

a mandamus petition, which, in fact, was filed here, in the
Court of Appeals and in this Court and by the Government and
rejected both by the Court of Appeals and the District Court,
that usurpation of power is challengeable.
Blair recognizes that.
QUESTION:

Blair recognizes beyond --

But then this doctrine really gives the

Petitioners nothing that a writ of mandamus or the application
for writ of mandamus might not give it.
MR. BEIL:
that's the case.

On the jurisdictional issue, I think

The Petitioners have plenary appeal on issues

personal to the witness.

Issues that are not raised here.

Privilege, burden, confidentiality. Notions like that are
raised here.
QUESTION:

When you say personal to the witness, you

mean by that that they affect the witness and no one else in
the case?
MR. BEIL:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Because certainly it's kind of personal to

go to jail.
MR. BEIL:

Yes, but we're not dealing, as I say,

we're not dealing with a criminal contempt here.

He is not

being punished for past non-compliance.
QUESTION:

And you say it would be different if we

were dealing with a criminal contempt?

Well, Justice Kennedy is correct in that.

the standing question, and to suggest that this case differs

18

from Allen v. Wright and prior determinations of this Court, by

19

particularly looking at the claim that's made by the Clergy

20

Respondents here.

21

The Clergy Respondents claim is under the

27

Establishment Clause.

In fact, it's a claim that goes to the

23

core of the Establishment Clause.

24

of one religion over another, which this Court has held is the

25

clearest command of the Establishment Clause, that kind of
40
Heritage Reporting Corporation

It's a claim of preference,

4

1
2

governmental preference is forbidden.
But when a challenge is made to governmental

3

preference, one religion over another, the most logical

4

plaintiffs to challenge that determination would be clergy

5

members of the disfavored group.

6

To take Justice Stevens' hypothetical and put it into

7

the Establishment Clause context, suppose the government

8

announced that it was subsidizing only, say, Quaker School

1

education, that the government would give cash grants to
10

schools that taught Quaker theology, I don't think this Court

U

would have any question, any hesitation in allowing clergy

12

members who ran schools that didn't teach Quaker theology from

13

challenging that determination.

QUESTION:

This is an enforcement agency challenge.

19

MR. BEIL:

Well, except that the difference here,

20

though, is that the enforcement -- the failure to enforce is

21

the equivalent of a subsidy. So, while we are challenging --

Well, that could have been said in Valley

colleges.

They were not people who were seeking the surplus

governmental property that was at issue there.
Here, we have clergy members who are directly
affected, personally affected by the same laws that their
Catholic counterparts are affected by, but the preference is
given to the Catholic clergy but not to the Clergy Respondents.
QUESTION:

It seems to me that the true counterpart,

the counterpart for Justice Stevens' hypothetical, would be an
organization in which it had its tax-exemption revoked, because
it had been lobbying or it had been active politically, and
they say you revoke my tax-exemption but you didn't revoke the
Catholic Church's, which was doing the same thing.
MR. BEIL:

Well, I think that those people would

certainly have standing, but certainly under the Establishment
Clause, you don't -- coercion is absent.
QUESTION:

Establishment Clause standing is to attack

spending of money.
MR. BEIL:

That's what we're arguing here.

QUESTION:

Well, but it's a long way around to say

that you're attacking a spending of money.

None of our cases

have gone that far.
MR. BEIL:

Well, I think that the Court has held that

the tax-exemption or tax deduction is the equivalent of a cash
grant. The government, in effect, pays for certain activities
by making it cheaper to do those activities. You don't have to
42

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

pay taxes on those activities,

2

in a discriminatory fashion,

3

in fact,

4

religion.

and when that power is exercised

to prefer one religion,

I think,

that is the equivalent of an endorsement of that

5

QUESTION:

That gives the taxing and spending clause

considerable scope.

You're saying taxing includes not taxing.

7

Is there anything else that exists besides taxing and not

fi

taxing?

BEIL:

So that what you have here is a situation in which

16

essentially the disfavored clergy are seeking to remove the

The fact that one group is being

13

not seek to be able to use tax-exempt money in political

14

campaigns, but I don't think that they have to -- that that

15

makes a difference because when the question is unequal

16

treatment, the Court has two alternatives to remedy that.

17

The Respondents here do

One is to extend the remedy to the disfavored group

18

or the other is to withdraw it from the favored group, and this

19

Court has held in various cases that deal with how to remedy

20

under-inclusive statutes and unequal treatment cases that the

2I

availability of either remedy gives standing to those who,

concerns that this Court has raised, and realize that in an

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS - REBUTTAL

Thank you, Mr. Beil.

19

MR. BAINE:

Thank you.

20

The issue of standing in this case is simply this.

2 .1

Do those who disagree with the Catholic Church's teaching on

22

abortion have standing to challenge the Church's tax-exemption

23

on the ground that the Church has allegedly crossed the line

24

between permissible and impermissible political activities in

25

the area of abortion.
47
Heritage Reporting Corporation

This case concerns the Catholic Church and abortion,
but you can substitute any church for the Catholic Church,
indeed, you can substitute any exempt organization for the
Catholic Church, and you can substitute any controversial issue
to the abortion issue.
Because if these Respondents have standing to
challenge the Catholic Church's tax-exemption, then any citizen
has standing to enforce -- to bring a suit to enforce Section
501(c)(3) against any organization he disagrees with.
Those who agree with the Catholic Church on abortion
would have standing to challenge the exemption of the
Presbyterian Church or of the American Jewish Congress, who
have joined an amicus brief, pointing out that they take a
different view.
Those who agree with the Catholic Church or disagree
with the Catholic Church or any church on any of the issues the
churches speak out on, including arms control, civil rights,
the economy, capital punishment, to name just a few, would have
standing to challenge the tax-exemption of that group on the
ground that the group's activities had crossed the line.
And what the Respondents say is that a citizen would
have standing to bring that suit, and this is the critical
point, regardless of whether that citizen himself has been
subjected to any unequal or any unfair treatment by the
Internal Revenue Service.

QUESTION:

Would they have standing to make precisely

the same claim made here?

They can say we don't care what you

do to us, we want you to take away the exemption for the
Catholic Church.
MR. BAINE:

If they're saying we don't care what you

do to us, I don't think they have an injury that they're
complaining about.

The injury is what was done to them.

QUESTION:

Well, the same injury, unequal treatment.

They're saying you've taken our -- what I'm really asking you
is, does it really make any difference to your argument whether
they have had their own tax-exemption challenged or not.

I

don't think it does.
MR. BAINE:

Well, I think it does.

I think that if

their tax-exemption had been revoked, -QUESTION:

They could then bring a lawsuit.

MR. BAINE:

-- they could then bring a lawsuit saying

that was unlawful and they could say it was unlawful because by
revoking mine and not revoking anybody else's, that's an equal
protection claim.

It would be like a selective prosecution

claim in a criminal context.
The point here, though, is that there has been no
unequal treatment at all.

case is that you get off just as everybody else has gotten off
