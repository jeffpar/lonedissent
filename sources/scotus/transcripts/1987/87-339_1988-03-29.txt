ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN J. MCGRATH, ESQUIRE

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MCGRATH:

10

11

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court.
The petitioners are here pursuant to Writ of Cert to

12

13

the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

And the issue is

.14

the authority of the FCC to preempt through the promulgation of

15

certain minimal guidelines as to cable television signal

16

quality, to preempt all local franchisers from promulgating

17

technical standards as to signal quality.

18

Now the Commission has adopted a deregulatory

19

approach to technical standards explicitly as to signal

20

quality.

21

itself had promulgated certain technical standards.

22

recognized over the years, however, that these were incomplete

23

and that they didn't cover certain problems such as ghosting of

24

a picture.

25

Now, in the past going back to 1972, the Commission
It has

Nevertheless, in 1985, after the passage of the New

Heritage

3
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

Cable Act, the Commission determined to no longer continue

2

these standards and after comments, issued a ruling in which

3

these prior standards were continued as guidelines that could

4

be included by franchisers in franchise agreements but that no

5

other standard, whether a similar standard which was more

6

stringent, or a standard for some other quality of signal

7

quality could be promulgated by local franchisers.

8
9

Now, the D.C. Circuit, finding more persuasive the
argument of the Commission that it continue to have a broad

10

delegated preemptive power which this Court had recognized in

11

the Capital Cities case under the old Communications Act, that

12

this continued under the New Cable Act, and held that as long

13

as one technical guideline was adopted by the Commission as to

14

a particular classification of channels, that they can preempt

15

any standards by local franchisers.

16

But even the Court of Appeals had some difficulty

17

with the approach of the Commission.

18

of channels for which any standards, now guidelines, had ever

19

been promulgated were the traditional broadcast channels.

There had never been any standards or guidelines adopted for

what is now the majority of cable televisions channels.

And these include not

We put in an engineering report below which first indicates the

insufficiency of the ones that are guidelines under the FCC and

that under those guidelines, if those minimums were all that

17

MR. MCGRATH:

6

Turning to the statutory, to the Cable

7

Act, itself, the Commission has pointed to one of the stated

8

purposes of the Act, that is to limit needless regulation.

9

However, the preeminent purpose is to establish a national

10

policy as to the cable industry.
Now, they did not choose to effectuate that policy as

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. MCGRATH:

12

Now, there was a problem back in the 70's and the

Modification, Justice Rehnquist.

13

early 80s, that both municipalities expected and the cable

14

companies hoped to meet very sky high requirements, both as to

15

services and to equipment and facilities.

16

Congress recognized this problem, passed this

17

provision, which allows upon a showing that attaining a

18

particular requirement was commercially impracticable that the

19

franchisee can be relieved of the requirement.

20

Perhaps most importantly is the next provision, the

21

renewal provision.

Now, this again was to face a problem, a

22

foreseen problem that cable companies that had expended vast

23

capital resources to establish a cable system would not be

24

unreasonably denied a renewal.

25

set out a detailed procedure controlling the renewal process,

10

My point is this, Justice Scalia.

Which says, let me tell you my problem

11

with it.

It says, the Commission may establish technical

12

standards relating to facilities and equipment which a

13

franchising authority may require in the franchise.

14

Now, it seems to me the natural reading of that is

15

the Commission may establish those technical standards which

16

and only which the franchising authority may require.

17

Otherwise, it seems to me, everything after, which, is

18

meaningless if we follow what you think --

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. McGrath, you may

continue.

5

MR. MCGRATH:

6

I'd like to return to the discussion of Section

7
8

Thank you, Justice Rehnquist.

624(e) and Justice Scalia's interpretation of that provision.
Now, we submit that a reading of that provision as

9

providing that there can be only technical standards where the

10

Commission has promulgated such standards is inconsistent with

11

the statute.

12

Now, first at page 116, Section 624(a)(1) empowers a

13

franchiser to require that in proposals, that the franchiser

14

may establish requirements for facilities and equipment.

15

are highly technical matters, and we submit that only through

16

-- and technical standards would naturally be part of a

17

requirement for facilities and equipment.

18

These

Possibly more relevant at page 127, as I stated

19

before, there's a delineated process in which renewal can be

20

accomplished, and there are a limited number of findings which

21

can be made to support a denial of renewal.

22

findings is laid out at page 127.

23

One of those

And if I can quote it:

"The quality of the operator service including signal

24

quality has been reasonable in light of community needs."

25

First of all, we submit that without technical standards,

there's no way in which such a finding can be made.

2

left to basing unsatisfactory signal quality, assuming the

3

Commission issued no guidelines, upon subjective complaints.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. MCGRATH:

We'd be

Well, that just gives you more authority.
But if one reads 624(e) the way I

6

believe the Chief Justice and Justice Scalia read it, we would

7

not have the power to issue any standards unless the Commission

8

first took the affirmative step of allowing us, in essence,

9

passing their own regulation and then we'd be allowed to adopt

10

that.
Now, if we're only empowered to pass the regulation

11

12

at the whim of the Commission and the Commission decided not to

13

pass any regulations this section would in essence be read out

14

of the Statute.

16

satisfactory in light of community needs.

17

And we submit the Commission's also probably

QUESTION:

Mr. McGrath, why is that so?

I mean,

18

subsection (b) includes things like quality of operator service

19

which I guess means whether maintenance people would come in,

20

and so forth, and you don't have to have any standards on that.
The response to consumer complaints, you don't have

21
22

standards on that.
And billing practices, there are no standards on

23
24

that.

Why couldn't they make findings dealing with each of

25

these subjects without any standards saying what the maximum or

20

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

minimum was?
MR. MCGRATH:

2
3

Justice Stevens r the main thrust of the

renewal procedure is to set up a due process kind of procedure.

4

QUESTION:

I understand.

5

MR. MCGRATH:

Whether or not it's absolutely

6

impossible to make this finding, it would seem quite

7

reasonable, and we submit compelling to be able to base the

8

determination upon whether or not they satisfied certain kinds

9

of standards.
QUESTION:

10

Do you think that this means by the same

11

argument that the FCC must promulgate regulations dealing with

12

billing practices and how to respond to consumer complaints?
MR. MCGRATH:

13

No, Justice Stevens, my argument is

14

just as Justice Scalia read 624(e), that the only entity that's

15

empowered to allow technical standards to be placed into

16

franchise agreements is the FCC.

17

both the local franchiser in light of 626 and the general

18

provisions of 624 is similarly empowered to issue technical

19

standards.

20

QUESTION:

We submit, no, that in fact,

You mean the local.

But they are to the

out in his concurrence of the first Midwest Video case, because

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, Mr. McGrath.

We'll hear now from you, Mr. Wallace.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G- WALLACE, ESQUIRE
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT, FCC
MR. WALLACE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court
Historically, the Commission applied technical
standards requirements to so-called class one channels which
are channels used to deliver broadcast signals of television
stations because that was the clearest authority that the
Commission had under the ancillary jurisdiction doctrine of the
Southwestern Cable case.

The Commission began to regulate in

this area before Congress enacted any statute dealing
specifically with cable casting.
Because the technical standards that the Commission
adopted were principally focused on the signal both visual and
oral that the worst located subscriber would actually receive
on his set, and because the other classes of cable were coming
through the same system, the standards for Class I channels

Heritage

24
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

tended also to control the quality of signals for the other

2

classes.

And for that reason, the Commission never did adopt

9

necessarily have a spillover effect to what the Commission can

10
11

We did not raise any question about the correctness
The question that the petitioners have

do about the other classes of channels.
So they're is a relationship there regardless of

12

whether technically the other classes are before the Court on

13

this petition.

The regulation that is at issue here --

14

QUESTION:

Do you understand them to be before us?

15

MR. WALLACE:

I had not understood them to be before

16

the Court except in the spillover effect that would necessarily

17

occur from the decision here.

18

The FCC Regulation that is at issue explicitly

19

prohibits local franchising authorities from enforcing more

20

stringent technical standards for cable casters than the

21

standards that the FCC has prescribed.

22

set out on the preceding pages, then on page 87 of the Appendix

23

to the Petition, the Commission Regulation is quite explicit

24

that these rule sections or less stringent versions of them may

25

be used as standards by state or local regulatory authorities,

Heritage

After the standards are

25
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

no technical parameter in excess of the above rule sections mayÂ­

9
/L

be required.

3

And the way local authorities require standards is

4

throuqh the franchising process or the renewal process in the

5

franchise agreements.

6

Commission's intent, as its report and order explain

7

unmistakably as well, was to prevent the local authorities from

8

enforcing more stringent standards on the cable casters.

9

this case therefore presents no occasion to consider guides to

So there's no doubt that the

And

10

interpretation that the Court has adverted to in other cases

11

that would disfavor preemption when there's some ambiguity

12

about whether preemption was intended.

13

The question in the case is whether this regulation

14

exceeds the scope of the Commission's statutory authority.

We

15

do not claim that the statute itself accomplished this

16

preemption of more stringent standards or that the statute

17

required the Commission to preempt local authority in this way

18

And in this respect, the case is similar to the

19

Capital Cities against Crisp case in which the preemption

20

flowed entirely from the Commission's regulation adopted in the

21

exercise of its broad authority to further the national

22

communications policy and not from anything in the statute,

23

which at that time didn't even refer to cable casting.

24
25

QUESTION:

You also would not agree with the reading

of 624(e) that I was suggesting earlier?

Heritage

26
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

I would agree with it entirely, Mr.

MR. WALLACE:

2

Justice, with the possible exception that it starts off saying

3

the Commission may establish technical standards.

4

discretion is in the Commission whether to establish the

5

technical standards.

6

Circuit in this case is the question of whether the Commission

7

could preclude local authorities from establishing their own

8

technical standards with respect to Classes II, III and IV, if

9

the Commission has not established any technical standards.

10

11

So that the

And what has been remanded by the D.C.

And of course that could be resolved by just having
the Commission establish some technical standards.

12

QUESTION:

3

III and IV is here?

You don't think anything about Classes II,

4

MR. WALLACE:

5

QUESTION:

Not directly, no, sir.

Directly?

Do we have to face it either

6

way we decide it?

If we decide either for you or for the other

7

side, we still don't reach II or III or IV?

8

MR. WALLACE:

9

QUESTION:

I agree with that, Mr. Justice White.

Yes, Mr. Wallace, but is it not true that

20

your theory might make a difference, does it depend on the

21

existence of some Federal standard, there's some minimal

22

Federal standard under Title I for Title I but not under Titles

23

II, III and IV, isn't that the point?

24

MR. WALLACE:

25

QUESTION:

That is correct.

And the question I have in my mind is

27

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

whether we agree with you on Title I, do we just leave open the

2

question on Title II, III and IV, or will we necessarily have

3

decided that?

4
5

6

MR. WALLACE:

Well, I think you do leave it open

because we did not petition from the remand.
QUESTION:

I'm not questioning about the remand but

7

the question I have is whether without promulgating any

8

technical standards at all, could the FCC under the statute say

9

we think the best way to achieve quality signals and all the

10

rest of it is by letting the free market have full play, and

11

simply say, we will promulgate none, and we forbid the states

12

and franchises.

13

MR. WALLACE:

That's what the Commission did with

14

respect to II, III and IV, and we argued in the Court of

15

Appeals that we could do that, and they said not without

16

explaining how that relates to the franchising process.

17
18
19

And now the Commission is reconsidering that, so
we're making no contention here.
QUESTION:

But my question is whether you would still

20

make the same legal -- because if you're right on that, this is

21

an awfully easy case.

22

arguing that or not.

23

But I don't know whether you're really

MR. WALLACE:

We're not arguing it that way because

24

that question is back before the Commission and the Commission

25

has not spoken yet.

28

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

628-4888

QUESTION:

1
2

Yes, but how can you win on Class I on the

ground that you are urging without winning on II, III and IV?
MR. WALLACE:

3

Well, on Class I, the Commission has

4

prescribed technical standards within the meaning of 624(e) on

5

page 118 of the Appendix, which says, the Commission may

6

establish technical standards.

7

technical standards for Class I, and those are the standards â€™

8

which it has said a franchising authority may require.

9

that's how we can win on Class I.

Court.

But we have not argued that in this

That is what is on remand.
In this Court, we have argued that the Commission has

18

established standards and said that Class I and said that the

19

local franchising authorities may not exceed them in requiring

20

standard policy.

21

QUESTION:

Well, doesn't that go to the power of the

22

Commission to preempt?

23

preempt, just the fact that there are regulations there

24

wouldn't preempt locals?

25

MR. WALLACE:

Heritage

Because except for the power to

Well, the forum of the regulation that'

29
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

is before the Court here is a form that includes an explicit

2

preemption provision but that form is encountered in a

3

situation where a Federal Agency has concluded that certain

4

options should be preserved for the regulated industry.

5

In that respect, this case is like Fidelity Federal

6

Savings against de la Cuesta where the Federal Home Loan Bank

7

Board concluded that federal savings and loan associations

8

should be allowed the option to use due on sale clauses if they

9

wished.

They didn't want to require them to use them so the

10

only way to preserve the option unambiguously was to say that

11

the option cannot be taken away by state regulatory authority.

12

QUESTION:

Well, I guess, Mr. Wallace, you're also

13

taking the position that even apart from the regulation adopted

14

by the FCC preempting that any promulgation of standards by the

15

FCC would effectively preclude the franchising authority from

16

having stricter standards?

17

MR. WALLACE:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

If, it would depend on â€”

You are arguing both things?

I that

right?
MR. WALLACE:

It would depend on if the Commission

21

told cable casters, these are the standards that you must use,

22

and you can't deviate from them up or down, then that would

23

preclude a requirement that would require them --

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, what if all the FCC did was adopt

some standards without telling anybody anything else?

30

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1

MR. WALLACE:

Then that would leave an ambiguity

2

which is not present in this case, and might lead to the

3

conclusion that the FCC did not mean to preempt local authority

4

from applying a more stringent standard.

5

But here --

6

QUESTION:

Now, as I understand it, you take the

7

position that the reason the FCC wants to promulgate standards

8

of this type is to encourage competition?
MR. WALLACE:

9

Is that right?

Well, to encourage the development of

10

the cable industry including in the competitive environment,

11

yes.

But also to encourage technological change.
QUESTION:

12

At the renewal stage, I gather it makes no

13

difference if there's another cable company that can put out a

14

stronger better signal and meet high standards?
MR. WALLACE:

15

But what the Commission's reports and

16

orders, both in '74 and in '85 said is that we're dealing with

17

a national market for this equipment.

18

matter of competition in the particular community.
QUESTION:

19

And it isn't just a

Well, I gather the competition only occurs

20

in the first instance of granting a franchise, not at the

21

renewal stage.

Is that right?

MR. WALLACE:

22

Well, there can be competitive

23

applicants for renewal, but one of the things that the '84 Act

24

did was to limit the discretion of local authorities to deny

25

renewals.

It put in safeguards for the renewal applicant that

Heritage

31
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1
2

did not previously exist.
QUESTION:

And today under that amendment now a

3

franchising authority could not deny renewal because it had a

4

better offer from some other company offering stronger and

5

better facilities, equipment, and signals?

6

MR. WALLACE:

It could not.

It could not if the

7

renewal applicant is meeting the standards prescribed by the

8

Commission.

9

What the reports and orders in both '74 when the

10

Commission first imposed nationwide technical standards, and in

11

'85 when the Commission concluded that it needed to prescribe a

12

standard that could not be exceeded in requirements imposed by

13

local authorities, what these reports emphasized was that a

14

multiplicity of standards would cause cost inefficiencies in

15

the industry.

16

And if some of the larger wealthier systems were to

17

move the industry to more expensive equipment, this could cause

18

problems of cost ineffectiveness for small systems that may

19

have only one or two thousand subscribers and might not be able

20

to get less expensive equipment.

21

And there was a great problem with rapid

22

technological innovation in the development of equipment that

23

standards might be prescribed in ways that would make

24

technological innovations not meet the standards.

25

time of the '85 report and order, there were more than 18,500

Heritage

32
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

And by the

1

local jurisdictions with franchising authority, and a diversity

2

of standards that would have to be changed in order to

3

accommodate technological innovations, and it might be

4

conflicting with one another, would impede the development of

5

cable casting and the ability of cable casting on a nationwide

6

basis to compete with other technologies.

7
8

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, what about the renewal

procedure?

9

Supposing that New York City has given a franchise

10

and they've got 300,000 people and at the time of renewal,

11

200,000 subscribers say, these signals are awful, it's all

12

snow.

13

franchiser because they haven't shown we haven't complied with

14

the minimum standards of the FCC?

15

Can the franchisee say, well, you can't go into that

MR. WALLACE:

If the local system concluded that

16

notwithstanding these 200,000 complaints the cable system is in

17

fact complying with the FCC standards, then its only option

18

would be to go to the Agency and say these standards are

19

inadequate.
But that would be a an implausible conclusion to

20
21

reach.

22

implausible is because the standards don't vary from locality

23

to locality and they're, they're, what they prescribe --

24
25

They might reach it.

QUESTION:

And the reason it would be

Well, what if the standards prove to

produce snow in every locality?

Heritage

33
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

MR. WALLACE:

1

But the standards are defined in terms

2

of what the subscriber will receive, the poorest located

3

subscriber, and because the signal is coming through cable, it

4

isn't affected by terrain or configuration of buildings, so

5

that if complaints were to be received in one place, comparable

6

complaints presumably would be received elsewhere.
QUESTION:

7
8

You say the standards are described in

terms of what the person sees on their set?
MR. WALLACE:

9

That is correct.

That is the main

10

thrust of the standards.

To some extent, it also defines

11

standards for transmission but the main thrust of it, and what

12

the standards are designed to assure is an acceptable quality

13

of picture and of sound on the screen of every subscriber

14

including the most poorly situated, the one farthest from the

15

head end, and the standards are all directed toward that.
So it would be implausible that one community would

16
17

be having problems that others wouldn't, if the standards were

18

being met.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, may I ask you a question

20

about the statutory authority which I think is the bottom line

21

here for the regulation.

22

As I understand your argument thus far, you rely

23

exclusively on 624(e), the section that deals with the

24

situation where the Commission has promulgated standards.

25

And as I also understand it, under Titles II, III and

Heritage

34
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

IV, there were no Federal standards, and the Commission still

2

asserted the authority to preempt in the same way.
And I would like to know what the statutory authority

3

4

for that position was, because if that's valid, it would seem

5

to me this case would a fortiori.
QUESTION:

6

Can you tell me that?

Would rather do it in one bite rather than

7

two.

You're going to be back up here for II, III and IV,

8

anyway, if it's all that clear, make a clean sweep of it.
MR. WALLACE:

9
10

Commission, you might adopt standards, but -QUESTION:

11
12

Not necessarily, because the

I still would like an answer to the

question, if there is one.
MR. WALLACE:

13

Well, one answer is 624(e) itself could

14

be interpreted to say that the Commission could decide that

15

zero is the technical standard that may be required in the

16

17

Another possibility is to refer back to authority

18

under the Communications Act itself and the broad standards.

19

We don't think it's necessary in this case for the Court to

20

resolve whether the Commission retains authority to deal with

21

cable casting apart from the provisions of the '84 Act.

22

Although we think the answer to that is probably, yes, and I

23

would refer the Court particularly to page 79 and following of

MR. WALLACE:

No.

Well, we think the '84 Act

suffices of purposes of what's before the Court.

QUESTION:

I understand that.

16

But I'm trying to find out, if we disagreed on that,

17

to what extent do you think it is appropriate to go to an

18

earlier statute to find authority.

MR. WALLACE:

We think the authority is there as it

was there for the '74 report and order.

that the Commission, had issued in '74.

No.

difference between its jurisdiction over technical standards

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARTOW FARR, III, ESQUIRE

10

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT, NATIONAL CABLE TELEVISION
MR. FARR:

11
12

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.

13

As the Commission has indicated, the issue in this

14

case is different from the issue in the usual preemption case

15

that comes before the Court, because here there is an express

16

statement by the Commission that it intends to preempt local

17

regulations.

18

The basic question then is the question that the

19

Court has been discussing which is, what is the scope of the

20

Commission's authority under the Cable Act?

21

in fact to allow the Commission to issue the regulations that

22

it has .

23

Is it broad enough

We think that the authority is broad enough, for a

24

couple of reasons.

25

specifically given authority in Section 624(e) to establish

First of all, the Commission was

Heritage

37
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

technical standards.

2

grant of authority.

And there are no limitations in that

We think that language is broad enough not just to

3
4

give the Commission the power to pick some numbers, which seems

5

to be the interpretation that the Cities argue for. but a power

6

also to consider the policies that go together within picking

7

the numbers.

8

could have established more detailed or more stringent

9

standards than the ones it did.

Now, the Commission, I think everybody concedes

But what it decided as a

10

matter of Federal policy is that the best way to serve the

11

goals to encourage better technology and to keep the cost of

12

cable services reasonable was not to have any additional

13

regulation, but in fact to let the industry itself develop the

14

standards that would achieve those goals.
Now, obviously, to suit that policy, there must be

15
16

preemption of additional local standards.

17

the policy couldn't be carried out.
QUESTION:

18

Otherwise, in fact,

That made a lot of sense to me until I

19

realized these standards you're talking about are performance

20

standards.
What you've just described makes it sound as though

21
22

you're describing technological standards so that the

23

municipalities won't force technology into one direction or

24

another.

25

come up with anyway is performance standards, hasn't it?

But you're telling me that what the Commission has

38

MR. FARR:

1

Well, they are performance standards that

2

involve obviously a technical component.

And the question for

3

the industry of course is what kinds of facilities and

4

equipment will meet those particular performance standards.

5

think that is what the Commission has aimed at.

I

6

If you look at the history of technical regulation,

7

there is a ten-year period of course where the Commission has

8

followed exactly the same policy before the Cable Act as it now

9

is pushing in the same, in the regulations since then.

Before

10

that, however, from 1972 to 1974, the Commission followed

11

exactly the policies the cities would like it to have to follow

12

now.

13

QUESTION:

You mean to 1984, don't you?

14

MR. FARR:

No, I'm sorry.

It's from '72 to '74,

15

that's right.

16

and followed them that way for a decade.

17

And then in '74, they changed the regulations

But from '72 to '74, they had just this policy that

18

the cities are arguing for where they imposed minimum standards

19

and allowed the cities to go above those standards and impose

20

whatever technical standards they wanted.

21

Commission came back to the issue and said, this has been a

22

disaster.

23

And in '74, the

What is happening is that we are having inconsistent

24

regulations.

for ten years prior to the Cable Act,

4

preemption.

5

The cost is going up,

and

So it changed its regulations and
followed a policy of

Now, the particular argument that the cities make,

6

therefore,

7

Congress did in 1984 is it said to the Commission, you cannot

8

follow the policy that you've been following for ten years --

9

ten years where the technology of cable expanded enormously,

if you look at it carefully, would mean that what

10

and you must go back to a policy that you tried for two years,

11

and gave up on as a failure.

12

And what we are saying is that if you look at the

13

structure of the Act, and particularly Section 624, which deals

14

with these matters, there simply is not any indication that

15

Congress intended to do that.

16

QUESTION:

The language of the Act to the uninitiated

17

is a little confusing, though, because in 624(b),

18

franchising authority may establish requirements for facilities

19

and equipment.

)

1
2

things like that, whether they met fire codes.
They did regulate this one area of technical

3

standards, and I think the language fairly tracks that.

4

Now, I would just like to touch briefly on the point

5

about renewal that has been made several times here, because I

6

think the cities have said, referring not to 624, but to

7

Section 626, that they really can't have a renewal process

8

unless they have their own standards.

9

that's so.
First of all, there are the FCC standards.

10

So if you

11

are looking for a set of objective standards, the FCC standards

12

are ones that cities can use in their franchises.
QUESTION:

13

5

And I don't think that

1415

Well, I guess their argument though is

those are so minimal that they want to do better, that they
don't do well enough.
MR. FARR:

16

Well, Justice O'Connor, I think that that

17

points up one of the differences here.

I think that there is a

18

difference between the power of the Commission essentially to

19

establish regulations and to make them preemptive which I think

20

is what this case is about.

21

I think there is a separate issue which is whether

22

these standards are adequate standards for the purposes that

23

the cities would like to use them.

24

do several different things if they don't like the particular

25

standards.

They are of course free to

They can go to the Commission, for example, and

1
Heritage

41
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

say, we have particular local conditions which are causing us a

2

problem that makes your standards inadequate.

3

like a waiver from the Commission in order to allow us to use

4

some additional standards or more detailed standards.
And the Commission has the power to grant that

5
6

And we would

waiver.

They even have a procedure for it.
Or it can go to the Commission and say, change the

7
8

standard.

We think the Federal standards should be higher.

9

They should be more detailed.

10

What the cities can't do though I think is what they

11

are asking to do here, which is to say regardless of what your

12

standards are, however high they are, we can always impose our

13

own idiosyncratic standards on top of those.

14

think, what the Commission was concerned about.
QUESTION:

15
16

And it is that, I

Mr. Farr, do you think they could do that

if the Federal standards were withdrawn entirely?

I think again that would not be a

preempt?
But I think the question

23

there would not be the basic question of whether they have the

24

power to preempt but whether the decision to do so was

25

arbitrary or capricious.

And I think in the case of the

42

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

channels II, III and IV below, that is what the Court of

2

Appeals in essence said.

3

We said, you know, you have broad powers in this area

4

but at some point we are concerned that if you exercise them in

5

a particular way, that is not defensible just as a matter of

6

their exercise, but not as a matter of the existence of the

7

power in the first place.

8

QUESTION:

And would you agree with Mr. Wallace the

QUESTION:

What I think Justice Stevens is that

area of technical standards, and I think that is a source of

power for the Commission to do that.

that would be perfectly legitimate.

it's clear that the standards are those that are to be

responsive to the community needs,

Even if we don't have the power to issue technical standards,
