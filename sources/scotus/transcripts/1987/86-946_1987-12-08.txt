ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

Mr. Gary, you may proceed

MR. GARY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Respondents in these cases were employed as drug
counselors.

They were fired from their jobs because they

1

deliberately violated their employer's rule that counselors

11

must refrain from all use of dangerous drugs.

12

unemployment benefits from the Petitioner State of Oregon. The

13

state's employment agency disqualified them because their drug

14

use was misconduct connected with their work.

They applied for

15

The question presented is straightforward.

16

claimants have a constitutional right under the Free Exercise

17

Clause to compel the state to pay them unemployment benefits

18

solely because the criminal conduct that led to their firing,

19

the use of peyote, was religiously motivated.

2

QUESTION:

Do

Mr. Gary, there seems to be some dispute

21

between you and your opponents as to whether this particular

22

conduct was criminal under the laws of Oregon.

23

MR. GARY:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, the conduct is

24

criminal under Oregon. That's an issue that was presented for

25

the first time in this Court, relying on one Court of Appeals
3

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(2 2) 628-4888

1

decision, State v. Downes, which was factually quite dissimilar

2

from this case.

3

with heroin and never had any possession of the drug.

4

It involved a heroin addict who was injected

The Oregon law is very clear that possession means

5

merely exerting control and, of course, the reason for the

6

prohibition against possession of dangerous drugs is precisely

7

to deter the use of the drug itself.

8

9

QUESTION:

Well, but, the statute prohibits

possession, not use, is that right?

30

MR. GARY:

That's correct.

11

QUESTION:

And it is, I guess, theoretically possible

12

that someone in a Native American church ceremony might have

13

peyote buds administered to him rather than possessing it, is

14

that right?

15

MR. GARY:

Your Honor, as I understand the practice,

16

it would be difficult to have it administered without

17

possessing, but, in any event, under Oregon law, the mere

18

presence of an individual in the ceremony where the peyote is

19

there would probably constitute sufficient possession of the

20

drug to be criminal under Oregon law.

21

Mr. Smith, one of the claimants in this case, in

22

fact, has made the argument that he needs to be exempted from

23

the Oregon law because of his religious beliefs, because the

24

conduct that he engaged in in this case and generally —

QUESTION:

Has the Oregon unemployment compensation

1

law dealing with commission of crimes been satisfied in this

2

case, either by the obtaining of a conviction of a felony or by

3

the admission of it?
MR. GARY:

4

No, and the Oregon Supreme Court correctly

5

concluded that that was not the basis for disqualification of

6

these claimants under state law.

7

disqualification of these claimants under state law was that

8

they violated a policy of the employer —

The basis for

9

QUESTION:

The employer's policy.

10

MR. GARY:

Yes, and —

11

QUESTION:

Willful misconduct of an employer rule or

12

requirement.

13

MR. GARY:

That's correct.

14

QUESTION:

But the Oregon court went on apparently to

15

find that the purpose of the Oregon unemployment compensation

16

law did not include a purpose to enforce Oregon's criminal law,

17

didn't it?

18

MR. GARY:

Your Honor, —

19

QUESTION:

It seems to have, determined as a matter of

20

state law that the purpose is to protect the fund and to take

21

care of the unemployment compensation policies, not the Oregon

22

criminal law policies.

23

MR. GARY:

No.

The Supreme Court's conclusion was

24

that it was bound by this Court's decision in Sherbert v.

25

Verner to consider only the state's interest in the fiscal
5

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

integrity of the fund. That is not entirely clear from the

2

opinion, but it is borne out by the -QUESTION:

3

Well, it certainly isn't because the

4

Oregon court said, as I read its opinion, that its purpose,

5

that the purpose of the Oregon law was to protect the fund.
MR. GARY:

6

No.

The argument that was advanced in the

7

Court of Appeals and in the Supreme Court revolved around the

8

question of whether Sherbert v. Verner would permit the Court

9

to look beyond the unemployment scheme itself at other

10
31

interests.
Oregon's interest in controlling the use of — the

12

conduct that is at issue here is manifested in a variety of

13

different schemes, not only in the criminal law, but in

14

education programs, rehabilitation programs, and also in the

15

unemployment scheme itself.

16

In this case, the disqualification for job-related

17

drug use was entirely consistent with the Employment Division's

18

policy of disqualifying anyone who is found to engage in job-

19

related drug use.

20

appendix to the Respondent's brief that was promulgated after

21

this case was decided but is consistent with the practice that

22

was in effect at this time, that demonstrates that any use of

23

dangerous drugs in the job market, anything that is job-

24

related, will be grounds for disqualification, and, so, I think

25

it's clear by an examination of the briefs and taking the

There is a policy that is included as an

6

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

Court's conclusion with respect to what interest it examines in

2

the context in which it was presented, that they were

3

concluding that this Court had found them by Sherbert to look

4

only at the fiscal interest.

5

QUESTION:

You can't derive that from the face and

6

text of the opinion, can you?

7

MR. GARY:

No. I concede that it is not entirely

8

apparent from the face of the opinion, but I think that when

9

you read the opinion in light of the arguments that were

10

presented to the Court, it is clear

11

It's also --

12

QUESTION:

What is — say it again. You've lost me.

13

MR. GARY:

The Oregon Court concluded that it was

14

bound by this Court's decision in Sherbert to look only at the

15

fiscal integrity of the fund as the state's interest, that it

16

was prohibited to look at other compelling health and safety

17

interests.

18

QUESTION:

So, you think that sentence, which reads

19

"the state's interest in denying unemployment benefits to a

20

claimant discharged for religiously-motivated misconduct must

21

be found in the unemployment compensation statutes, not in the

22

criminal statutes", describing the use of peyote, you think

23

that sentence is meant to be a statement of federal law rather

24

than a statement of state law?

25

MR. GARY:

Yes.

QUESTION:

1

2

What they're saying is that under

Sherbert, you have to find it within the state's -MR. GARY:

3

Yes. The Supreme Court's opinion in this

4

case is merely a wooden application of the Sherbert rule, and

5

they make a wrong step because they missed the threshold

6

inquiry in Sherbert.

7

that the state has no interest in regulating the underlying

8

conduct.

Sherbert proceeds from the assumption

Because the state has no interest in regulating the

9
10

underlying conduct in Sherbert,

the state had no interest in

11

regulating Mrs.

12

interest that the Court — the state could assert was an

13

interest other than interest in regulating that conduct.

Sherbert's Sunday worship,

then the only

Sherbert stands for the proposition that the state

14
15

cannot burden a protected religious practice indirectly when it

16

cannot burden it directly.

17

between this case and Sherbert and Thomas and Hobbie is that

18

here the state does have a vital health and safety interest in

19

regulating the conduct that these claimants engaged in.

20

acted on that health and safety interest by making the conduct

21

criminal.

The vital distinction in this case

It has

If the conduct is criminal, the state cannot be

22
23

required to provide benefits to these claimants because the

24

claimants had no right to engage in the conduct in the first

25

place.

2

QUESTION:

Unless it's unconstitutional to render it

MR. GARY:

Precisely.

criminal.

3

And it is not unconstitutional

4

to render it criminal because of the nature of the state's

5

health and safety interest.
Oregon, like all states, has determined that there is

6

7

a compelling need to deal with the problems of drug abuse and

8

no one in this Court disputes that.

9

the state's interest in regulating drug use is conceded by the

10

11

The compelling nature of

claimants.
They also concede that that compelling interest is

12

furthered by the criminal prohibition. Peyote is a Schedule 1

13

drug in Oregon.

14

that there is no safe use for it.

15

even under the care of a physician and that there is a great

16

susceptibility to drug abuse.

17

It is -- that means that it has determined
It cannot be used safely

Now, once we have borne the burden of demonstrating

18

our compelling interest, the responsibility then is to

19

demonstrate that that compelling interest would be undermined

20

by granting an exemption to the criminal law in order to

21

accommodate the religious practice at issue here.

22

In order to accommodate the religious practice would

23

undermine the state's compelling interest in at least four

24

different ways.

First, peyote is dangerous to the user and to
That's the very

reason why the state has criminalized it in the first place.

All

The dangers posed by peyote are indifferent to the

recreational purposes or for personal enlightenment.
Once peyote is made lawful for some purposes, as

11

12

these claimants contend they have a right to require the state

13

to do, then the problem of controlling drug trafficking is

14

significantly compounded.

15

Southwestern United States, primarily Texas and in parts of

16

Mexico. It would be difficult to distinguish meaningfully

17

between traffic for lawful purposes and traffic for unlawful

18

purposes.

19

Peyote only grows in the

The simple fact is that once some people have a right

2

to possess peyote, there is an increased risk the drug will

21

fall into the hands of those who do not have that right.

22

is a risk that others will commit crimes against persons who

23

possess peyote lawfully in order to obtain it from them.

There

These claimants, like eighty-nine percent of the
Native American population in Oregon, reside in urban areas,

and that merely compounds the risk th$t the presence of the
2

drug in the community will mean that it will fall into the

hands of persons who cannot possess it.

The record in this case includes an affidavit from

5

Stanley Smart, who is a road chief, who conducts the peyote

ceremony.

QUESTION:

Well, pick some other narcotic that is

19

generally illegal for traffic but is allowed to be used for

20

some purposes.

21

MR. GARY:

Yes.

That's correct.

22

QUESTION:

Laudanum or whatever you want.

23

MR. GARY:

That's correct, and that problem is

24

addressed because there is a conclusion that there are some

25

safe uses for the drug and that it serves a purpose.
11
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

2
3

QUESTION:

Well, the purpose alleged here is a

religious one.
MR. GARY:

That's correct.

But the religious use is

4

the same use that the state has concluded is dangerous and I

5

think demonstrably dangerous because of the nature of the

6

hallucinogenic state that it produces, and the record in this

7

case reflects that the purpose of the religious practice is to

8

induce that hallucinogenic state.

9

And, so, the danger that everyone concedes the state

10

has a compelling interest to address is directly implicated by

11

the practice at issue here.

12

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Gary, I'm still concerned

13

because I'm not sure we even get to that question, unless we

14

get over the initial hurdle that I asked you about.

15

can return to that a minute, are you asking us to hold as a

16

matter of federal law that Oregon must exercise its police

17

powers through its unemployment compensation scheme?

18

MR. GARY:

No, Your Honor.

And if I

I am asking you to hold

19

as a matter of federal law two things.

20

state has a regulatory interest in the conduct that underlies

21

the disqualification for unemployment benefits, it is

22

appropriate for the Court to consider that interest in

23

determining whether the disqualification is an impermissible

24

burden on free exercise.

25

QUESTION:

First, that where the

Even when the Oregon Court, as a matter of
12

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

state law, perhaps has refused to do it?
MR. GARY:

2

Well, if they refuse to do it as a matter

3

of state law, then my burden is much heavier to carry.

4

point is that they did not and at a minimum --

5
6

7

QUESTION:

But we don't know that for sure.

MR. GARY:

No.

My

We don't

know that.
I suspect that the record in this

8

case, when you review it, will confirm my assertion that the

9

determination by the Supreme Court of Oregon was a

10

determination that they felt bound to make by virtue of this

11

Court's prior decisions.

12

If you reach that conclusion, then, at a minimum,

13

this case must be sent back to the Court for them to consider

14

the application of our health' and safety interest in the

15

context of the regulatory scheme at issue.

16

But you don't even need to get to that point because

17

our threshold point is that the criminal law of Oregon is

18

relevant to the determination in a federal constitutional sense

19

that the Supreme Court of Oregon simply swept under the rug,

20

and that is our first argument, that because the conduct is

21

prohibited as a matter of criminal law, assuming that that

22

criminal prohibition is constitutional and we contend that it

23

is, then these claimants had no free exercise right to engage

24

in the conduct and Sherbert simply doesn't apply because

25

Sherbert only controls when the state has no interest that it
13

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

has acted upon in regulating the conduct itself.
When the state has regulated the conduct itself and,

2
3

as in this case, has outright prohibited it, Sherbert doesn't

4

apply.

5

Justice Brennan in his opinion that you enter into the analysis

6

that requires the state to prove a compelling state interest

7

from withholding the benefits only because the state has no

8

interest in regulating the conduct.

You don't even get past that threshold holding by

QUESTION:

9

Then, it seems to me you're suggesting

10

that really the critical issue in the case that has to be

11

decided is whether the conduct of using peyote in a Native

12

American religious ceremony is constitutionally protected or

13

not.

14
15
16

I think it's critical to your case that there is no
constitutional protection for this use of peyote.
MR. GARY:

Yes.

It is critical to our case that

17

there is no constitutional protection.

18

necessary for the Court to decide that Oregon can criminalize

19

the conduct because we think that the Court can and should

20

evaluate the state's regulatory interest in the context of the

21

question of whether benefits may be denied.

22

QUESTION:

It is not absolutely

You say if there really is no free

23

exercise right out there, then we don't even reach the problems

24

of Sherbert and those cases, is that right?

25

MR. GARY:

That's precisely correct.
14

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

And because of

1

that —
QUESTION:

2

And do you read the Oregon Supreme Court's

3

opinion as resting perhaps by implication on the proposition

4

that the religious use of peyote cannot be punished or burdened

5

by the state because of the federal free exercise clause?

6

MR. GARY:

No, I don't.

I don't think the Supreme

7

Court even considered that question, although it was advanced

8

before them, and the reason that the Court's opinion should not

9-

be read to hold that Oregon cannot punish the conduct

10

criminally is because it would require the Supreme Court to

11

overrule a prior Court of Appeals decision in Oregon State v.

12

Soto, which held precisely the opposite.

13

The only law in Oregon, judicial decision in Oregon,

14

says that there is no constitutional right to an exemption from

15

tv e application of the criminal law for religious use of

16

peyote.

17

QUESTION:

So, the Supreme Court of Oregon rested its

18

decision on the federal free exercise clause, but not on the

19

ground that you could not criminalize peyote?

20

MR. GARY:

That's correct. In essence, what the

21

Oregon Supreme Court did was leap-frog over that threshold

22

inquiry and then enter into a balancing test which was

23

hopelessly infected by a misreading of this Court's decision in

24

Sherbert.

25

mean, the financial interests and they did not consider our

Even then, they only considered the regulatory — I

15

regulatory Interests.
QUESTION:

2

Specifically, you think they read Sherbert

3

as requiring that whatever state interest exists in order to

4

overcome the claim for an exemption or an unwritten exemption,

5

whatever state interest exists must be reflected in the

6

compensation statutes themselves?

7

MR. GARY:

That's correct.

8

QUESTION:

Rather than just in some criminal law?

9

MR. GARY:

Yes, Your Honor.

I think that's the way

10

they read Sherbert , and in order for them to read that,

11

Sherbert,

12

Sherbert, reiterated in Thomas and Hobbie, that the state had

13

no interest in regulating the conduct as a holding that the

14

state's interest in regulating the conduct was irrelevant to

15

the inquiry.

16

Oregon Supreme Court made.

that way,

they mistook this Court's conclusion in

That was the constitutional mistake that the

17

Now, --

18

QUESTION:

Well, suppose there hadn't been any First

19

Amendment issue at all, did the Oregon Supreme Court indicate

20

that benefits should have in any event been granted in this

21

case because the legality of the conduct was just irrelevant?
MR. GARY:

22

No, Your Honor.

The Court specifically

23

held that the benefits would be denied as a matter of state

24

law, and if I could, I'd like to walk you through the Court's

25

decision.
16

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

2

QUESTION:

And that was in the part of the opinion

that dealt with Oregon law?

3

MR. GARY:

That's correct.

4

QUESTION:

The first part of the opinion?

5

MR. GARY:

That's correct.

6

QUESTION:

So that the second part of the opinion

7

where the Court says that the unemployment benefit, the Board,

8

the Division concedes that the commission of an illegal act

9

does not in itself disqualify, if that were true, why, you

10

would think that they wouldn't have needed to get to any

11

federal issue.

12

MR. GARY:

Yes.

I think you're right, and that's why

13

it's a little astonishing that the Court takes our concession

14

in the part of our brief where we are talking about the state

15

law issue of whether these people are disqualified and then

16

translates that into our — the part of our brief that dealt

17

with the impact of the criminal prohibition on the federal

18

constitutional issue, and it's a little bit baffling, but it's

19

very clear from our briefs that have consistently argued that

20

the criminal conduct was not the basis for the disqualification

21

under Oregon law, but that the fact that the conduct is

22

criminal is vital to the Court's assessment of the free

23

exercise clause.

24
25

QUESTION:

Because they did in the end rest their

judgment on the free exercise clause, did they not?
17

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

MR. GARY:

1

Yes.

What the Court did was begin as the

2

Oregon Court always does by looking at its own statutes,

3

concluded that under Oregon law, because these claimants

4

engaged in job-related drug use, that actively undermined their

5

employer's interests, which in this case happens to coincide

6

with the state's interests, that constituted misconduct in

7

connection with the work and like anyone who engages in job-

8

related drug use, these claimants are disqualified under state

9

law.

10

They then turn to the Oregon Constitution and

11

state to provide benefits in any event and they turned

specifically then to this Court's decision in Sherbert v.

MR. GARY:

QUESTION:

1

Well, let me put It another way.

Suppose

2

that In -- when the Court was dealing with Oregon law, it had

3

been found that what the employee did was not incompatible with

4

her job or his job, then the claimant would not have been

5

disqualified just because the conduct was criminal.
MR. GARY:

6

That's correct.

Right?

In Oregon, one is

7

disqualified only for job-related drug use and there's a very

8

good reason for that.

9

requires that in order for states to have qualified programs,

The Federal Unemployment Tax Act

10

they can only disqualify persons for job-related misconduct.

11

Therefore, it is completely irrelevant under the Federal

12

Unemployment Tax Act and in order for Oregon to have a

13

qualified program, we cannot disqualify persons for off-the-job

14

drug use.
But it is, nevertheless, very clear that if you're

15
16

going to apply the state's regulatory interest in the context

17

of the unemployment scheme, it plays out in exactly the same

18

way as when you look at the state's regulatory interest and

19

consider whether these claimants are entitled to an exemption

20

from the criminal law.
The criminal prohibition is just one important

21
22

application of the State of Oregon's public policy to curb drug

23

abuse.

24

reflected in other programs and is reflected in the

25

unemployment compensation scheme.

As I said earlier, the same policy is furthered and

Job-related — and, really, the Respondents in this

case can't contest that because the very heart of their claim

14

is that the disqualification burdens, their practice of drug

use, and since our purpose is to burden their practice of drug

16

use, demonstrates that the unemployment compensation scheme

17

serves that purpose, and the same reasons that we cannot give

In fact, when drug use spills into the work place,

the hazards of that use are even greater.

In this case, we

were talking about drug counselors who, to serve the interests

of their clients by acting as role models, that suggested that

drugs, but it might just as well have been someone

2

manufacturing automobiles or flying airplanes.

o

Drug use in the work place is a very serious concern.

4

It's real, immediate and compelling, and the same reasons that

5

we can't grant the exemption would apply in the context of the

unemployment scheme itself.

QUESTION:

Well, suppose this employee had worked for

8

Harry and David and just used peyote in a religious ceremony

and was fired because of that and the employee applied for

11

unemployment compensation, he would have gotten that.
MR. GARY:

If the conduct was not job-related, they

12

would get unemployment benefits, but the reason for that, Your

13

Honor, is because, as I indicated, Federal Unemployment Tax Act
*

14
15

limits our inquiry to job-related conduct.
QUESTION:

All right.

But if the unemployment board,

16

nevertheless, denied compensation, it would have been reversed

in the Supreme Court?

MR. GARY:

It would have been

QUESTION:

Under state law.

anyone to be disqualified.

The only reason that compensation was denied was

the Respondent's brief relating to disqualification —
QUESTION:

9

Well, how can you really argue that

10

although criminal conduct is not enough to deny compensation

11

for, it, nevertheless, can be relied on to overcome a free

12

exercise claim?
MR. GARY:

13

For two reasons.

First, because if the

14

conduct is criminal, the claimants have no right to engage in

15

the conduct and, therefore, they can't assert a free exercise

16

claim.

17

Second, because the state has a regulatory interest

18

that must be folded into the calculation, even if you look at

19

whether these people should have a constitutional exemption

20

from the application of the state law-based disqualification.

21

QUESTION:

I'm not sure I understand why that's a

22

second reason.

23

interest in enforcing the criminal law?

Isn't the regulatory interest the same as the

QUESTION:

If you had a statutory exemption from the

the paragraph, which reads:

5

the state did here, to be referring to what is necessary for

6

the state's interest to be considered over-riding under

7

Sherbert and Thomas, and the Court is saying in order to be so,

it has to be found in the unemployment compensation statutes,

The decision, though, that the

Yes, but the — I thought your argument

QUESTION:

Yes, yes.
Rather than it was not decided —

Given that interpretation of the state

MS. LOVENDAHL:

Exactly.

Those cases are

controlling.
If you accept the Attorney General Office's argument

15

here, the effect ultimately is to present, actually present

16

establishment law problem. They say that there is an

17

establishment law problem and I say that if these cases are

18

reversed, you're presenting an establishment law problem

19

because no other person who was in this situation would have

20

been denied benefits on the grounds of illegality.

21

are really trying to get the Court to consider illegality in

22

the context that no other person would be penalized on that

23

specific basis.

24
25

QUESTION:

So, they

Well, I guess they say they would have

been denied benefits on the grounds of employee misconduct.
26

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

MS. LOVENDAHL:

1

Right.

There is a work connection

2

here, but it was the same situation as Sherbert, Thomas and

3

Hobbie.

4

There was a work connection in all of those cases.
The test isn't whether the person's getting a special

5

benefit because of their religion, but are they being

6

differently than other people who are forced — they are being

7

forced to choose between their religion and their job.

8

9

state who are involuntarily unemployed and eligible for that

Are

benefit program.
In Sherbert and Thomas and Hobbie, the people were

12

refusing to do work and nobody else who had been in that

13

situation, nobody who refused to do their job all together

14

would have gotten benefits. Nobody who refused to work, on

15

Sunday would have gotten benefits, but other religions were not

16

put to that choice.

17

In this case, though, if you do compare fact for

18

fact, in fact, it is not true, as the Attorney General's Office

19

represents, that all job-related drug use is disqualified.

20

cited two cases in my brief that are acknowledgement of the

21

recognition that alcoholism and drug use are considered — this

22

was an employer who was a rehabilitation employer and it was

23

their philosophy that any use of drugs or alcohol by a

24

recovering person was an illness.

25

So, in this situation, if the people were drug and
27

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

I

1

alcohol counselors, if they used drugs off duty and it was a

2

product of a drug addiction or if they used wine in a church

3

ceremony, that would be considered relapse, and as long as the

4

individuals were able to work and do other jobs, they would, in

5

fact, be eligible for benefits.
So, these people would really be disadvantaged by

6

7

applying a test requested by the Attorney General's Office

8

rather than the reverse in this case.
The most disturbing suggestion that the state makes

9
10

in this case is that they can extinguish a free exercise

11

guarantee simply by labeling conduct as criminal.

12

been obvious for quite some time that the established test is

13

that under the Constitution you have a right —
QUESTION:

14

I think it's

May I ask you right there on that

15

question, of course, it's more than labelling it, I suppose

16

they do have a statute that makes it a crime to use certain

17

drugs.

18
19
20

21
22

Is it your position that it's constitutionally
impermissible to prohibit the religious use of peyote?
MS. LOVENDAHL:

Well, I think that that balancing

test has to be applied. • You can't ignore the balancing test.
QUESTION:

But if you apply the balancing test, do

23

you end up with -- in order to prevail, is it not correct that

24

you must submit that your clients had a constitutional right to

25

make — to use peyote in their religious ceremonies, that the
28

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

2

state could not interfere with that right?
MS. LOVENDAHL:

Well, our position is that if you

3

have to look at the statute at issue that's imposing the

4

burden. In the unemployment context scheme, there was — the

5

legality of the contact was really irrelevant.

6

an issue that was decided before.

7

QUESTION:

So, it wasn't

Well, it's relevant if you say that the

8

state may enforce a neutral law that prohibits all drug use

9

even that that is religiously motivated.

Then, the law is

10

relevant to the ultimate question of whether you have — your

11

clients had a constitutional right to engage in this conduct.

12

MS. LOVENDAHL:

Right.

It's a very circular type of

13

situation that we're in and that is presented by the state in

14

this, case, but the fact is that under the Constitution, you

15

have a free exercise right and it can only be overcome if the

16

state can show a compelling interest.

17

Now, in each individual fact situation, the fact is

18

that under the unemployment statutes, this person is put to the

19

same choice as the person who is under their religion.

20

have to choose between the job requirement and adhering to

21

their faith.

22

In a criminal situation, —

23

QUESTION:

They

Yes, but the difference that I don't think

24

you're really confronting is the fact that there's really no

25

dispute that in the Sherbert and Hobbie and Thomas cases, the
29

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

conduct that was -- that caused the discharge was conduct that

2

they had a constitutional right to engage in.

3

There's an issue, however, in this case as to whether

4

your clients had a constitutional right to engage in the

5

conduct that led to their discharge.

MS. LOVENDAHI.:

Yes, and in —

And don't you have to convince us that

they did have a constitutional right in order to prevail?
MS. LOVENDAHL:

No, I don't think we do, because I

10

feel that that'V the problem with their argument, is that they

11

can't boot strap another statute.

12

The fact is that he has a free exercise right —

13

QUESTION:

If you don't have such a federally

14

protected right, I don't see that there's even a federal

15

question in the case.

16

MS. LOVENDAHL:

Well, there would be if that issue

17

could be decided, but under the state unemployment statute, the

18

interest to be served by that statute is to protect

19

involuntarily unemployed workers, and I think the question in

20

this case really is would that interest be thwarted by giving

21

unemployment benefits —

22

QUESTION:

Yes, but the Court ruled that under Oregon

23

law, there was — these benefits were properly denied, and the

24

claim then was, well, yes, but the first — the free exercise

25

clause forbids you to deny benefits in this case, even though
30

Heritage Reporting Corporation

would be denied.

that there is a free exercise clause right to engage in

criminal conduct.

that in our brief.

opinion was that they looked to the legality before they did

8

the balancing test to see whether it should be considered or

9

not.

I think that they rejected the Attorney General's

10

argument because the purpose of the unemployment statute was

11

not to enforce the state criminal code.

12

Admittedly, that's a statute that imposes a burden,

13

but the unemployment compensation, the burden imposed by that

14

statute, was what the Court was trying to determine.

It was a separate

In Wisconsin v. Yoder, the Court stated that only
those interests of the highest order and those not otherwise

10

served can over-balance claims to the free exercise of

11

religion, and in this case, the state has a set of statutes

12

designed to serve its interests in law enforcement and the

13

state legislature made it clear that the unemployment

14

compensation statute is not to serve that purpose.

' 15

There might be some instances where that's not the

16

case, but accepting their theory in this situation, the fact is

17

that the individuals would not -- would be discriminated

18

against rather than favored. The Division does pay benefits to

19

people who engage in criminal law, and the only difference here

20

is that the people are work-connected. They're claiming that

21

they're getting a special protection under the free exercise

22

clause that they wouldn't have gotten but for their religion,

23

but the fact is that the reason we have a free exercise law is

24

to balance the rights that the majority has through

25

legislation.

If this was a majority religion in this country, this

1

2

practice would never be illegal, and that’s where that balance

3

comes in, and why it's important to protect this type of

4

conduct.

5

We do feel, though, that if the state is obligated

6

somehow under the federal Constitution to consider the status

7

of the criminal statutes, that, first, it is extremely unclear

8

that Mr. Smith and Mr. Black could have been charged with any

9

crime. They admitted that they used peyote in the ceremony.

10

Use itself is not illegal.

11

possessed it or exercised dominion and control over it.

12

They never admitted that they

From the Native American Church amicus brief, it is

13

clear that it's the road man who exercises dominion and control

14

and that the people who attend the ceremony have no more

15

control than an individual who's at a Christian ceremony when

16

wine is used.

17

It is essentially the same situation.

QUESTION:

Well, is it necessary for the state's case

18

in order to refute the necessity -- the constitutional

19

necessity for an exception to their unemployment scheme, is it

20

necessary for them to show that this particular conduct would

21

have been unconstitutional or isn't it enough to show that

22

there is a general state policy against the use of drugs?

23

I mean, the policy against the possession of it is

24

obviously directed to prevent the use of it, and wouldn't it be

enough just to show a general policy whether the state showed

I'm not quarreling about the weighing

I'm quarreling about your assertion that there's

10

nothing to weigh because this individual had not violated the

11

criminal law.

You're trying to preclude the weighing.
Right. That would make it a different

that they didn't engage in criminal conduct and they couldn't

QUESTION:

17

I'm saying I don't see how that's

MS. LOVENDAHL:

Yeah, and there was a strongly worded

Heritage Reporting Corporation

In any event, in terms of the constitutionality of

the practice, the state has a history of lack of enforcement.

3

So, it doesn't appear that they have an overwhelming interest

in over-riding or disposing of this particular church practice,

5

and the only concern that they have is that flood gates will

essentially be opened.

This isn't a situation, though, where many other
