ORAL ARGUMENT BY FLOYD ABRAMS, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

I

Mr. Abrams, you may proceed

MR. ABRAMS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This appeal arises out of the reliance by the State

10

of Mississippi in the sentencing phase in a capital murder case

11

of the trial of Samuel Johnson, of a 1963 New York conviction

12

for assault in the second degree that has since been reversed

13

by the New York Court of Appeals, and is thus under New York

14

law, a nullity.

15

The 1963 New York conviction was referred to 22 times

16

by the prosecutor during the sentencing phase of the trial, and

17

was emphasized by the prosecution as a prime basis for the

18

imposition of the death penalty.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

What was the basis of the reversal of the

conviction, Mr. Abrams, by the New York Court of Appeals?
MR. ABRAMS:

The New York Court of Appeals reversed

22

the conviction specifically on the ground that there had been

23

no right to appeal provided to Sam Johnson in New York.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. ABRAMS:

No right to appeal?
Well, it was a few things which came

of New York, he had never been advised that he had a right to

appeal in New York.

4

separate occasions, the Court of Appeals observed, after his

5

time had expired, after he learned and tried pro se to appeal.

He was not provided with counsel, appellate counsel that

represented him competently in New York, the New York Court of

Appeals commented on that.

He sought to appeal in New York on three

All this time having passed, however, and having

12

passed because of the fault of New York, not Sam Johnson who

13

had tried to appeal thrice during this period, the New York
Court of Appeals reversed the conviction that had been entered

14

15

against Mr. Johnson.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

The just didn't give him a late appeal

then.
MR. ABRAMS:

No, what they said in effect is that

19

there is not enough left to talk about here.

20

Mr. Chief Justice, was this.

21

What happened,

The lower court in this case had resentenced Mr.

22

Johnson so that he could appeal.

23

state authorities had urged; simply a resentencing.

24

urged in the lower courts in New York vacation of the judgment

25

We lost on that at the State Supreme Court level.

That was what the New York

4
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

We had

We lost on

1

that at the appellate division level.
The New York Court of Appeals said, in substance, it

2
3

isn't enough in this case, there is nothing to hear on this

4

appeal.

5

There is no point in having a Huntley hearing, for example.

6
7
8
9

There are no records left to examine on this appeal.

QUESTION:

Isn't the burden normally on an appellant

in New York to show error?
MR. ABRAMS:

Not in a situation, Your Honor, where he

was denied a Jackson hearing.

On the voluntaryness of a

10

confession, for example, the burden is on the state to show

11

that it was voluntary.

12

Now in this case we came forward with affidavits from

13

trial counsel, from Mr. Johnson himself, from the state legal

14

defender's office that was supposed to but did not represent

15

him when they were assigned to represent him on the appeal, all

16

of which taken together persuaded the New York Court of Appeals

17

that not only had Johnson been denied a right to appeal, but

18

that he had serious claims which he could have made.

19

QUESTION:

Do they ordinarily -- but they would pass

20

on those claims, I would think.

21

MR. ABRAMS:

Ordinarily what the New York Court of

22

Appeals has done in the past in the

Rivera case, the Montgomery

23

case where a lot of time has passed

and it has passed because

24

of the action of the state, only if

it has passed because of

25

state misconduct so to speak as opposed to

defendant

5

Heritage Reporting Corporation

%

1

misconduct, what they have routinely done in New York in those

2

cases is to dismiss and to reverse the state conviction.
QUESTION:

3
4

on the merits as to whether the conviction was infected with

5

error.
MR. ABRAMS:

6
7

9

In this case, the court, having read the affidavits,
said that there were claims, serious claims of possible merit

10

which Mr. Johnson had.

11

adverted to earlier.

12
13
W

In the earlier Rivera case, they made no

decision on the merits as to the correctness of the conviction.

8

^

Even though they do not make any judgment

QUESTION:

Those claims were the ones that I

That was as far as they went on the

merits ?

14

MR. ABRAMS:

Yes.

On the merits as far as they went

15

was to say that there were serious claims of possible merit.

16

Those claims were claims relating to the use of a coerced

17

confession and the like against him in his 1963 trial and

18

related matters.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. ABRAMS:

21

The conviction is a nullity under New

York law.

QUESTION:

23

MR. ABRAMS:

Mr. Abrams, that means that another state

MR. ABRAMS:

Again, I would distinguish between a

pardon issued by the executive of the state and a judicial

determination.

22

The answer might be the same under Full Faith and

Credit if the effect in the state where the pardon was issued

24

is that he has no record at all and it is as if he had done

25

nothing at all.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. ABRAMS:

Right.
If a pardon wipes it out completely,

12

then I would be urging upon you that a pardon under Full Faith

13

and Credit ought to be given the same effect as if it was a

14

judicial decree.

15

Now as to whether that argument would persuade as to

16

whether a pardon is close enough, exact enough fit to a

17

decision of the highest court of the state, I think it probably

18

should be if you are in a state in which the pardon completely

19

eliminates the prior conviction.

20

I can't tell you that that would --

Now if I'm wrong about it being a nullity, that would
be one thing.

But I don't think there is any dispute on that.

QUESTION:

4

It's your position that the Full Faith and

Credit Clause has a negative operation; that a second state

cannot give a judgment any more faith and credit than it has

given in the state that it originated.

That's correct.

QUESTION:

then?

MR. ABRAMS:

The basis of the argument is this.

15

Mississippi adhered, took advantage of, so to speak,

16

as a matter of fact by federal statute.

Justice, that Mississippi is obliged to give full faith and

Do you have a case in mind that supports

MR. ABRAMS:

I will give you that name right after

lunch, Mr. Chief Justice.
But I want to make clear, I am not urging on this

19

Court that there is a body in this Court's law of Full Faith

20

and Credit law which is exactly on point in terms of this case.

21

What this Court has done and done with some frequency in three

22

separate cases is to deal with the question of what happens in

23

a situation in which a jury that is engaged in the sentencing

24

process or a judge in fact receives materially false

25

information, or receives information in the U.S. v. Tucker case

11

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

which is false about the validity of a prior sentence.
2

not full faith and credit.

I'm not urging upon you that it is.

But I do want to start out by saying that this Court

3
4

has had those cases in the past, that all 12 Court of Appeals

5

in this country have had cases and have routinely, all of them,

6

held that resentencing should be required in situations in

7

which juries receive information about sentences which

8

subsequently have been reversed.

That's

Now all those are not cases involving states doing

10

one thing and then changing their policies.

Faith and Credit cases.

12

what we are urging upon you here in terms of resentencing has

13

been the most ordinary, usual, repeated action of state courts

14

around the country.

15

case in which a state court has not resentenced in a situation

16

after a conviction that was relied upon has been reversed.

17

every federal Court of Appeals in one way or another has done

18

that.

24

federal convictions, often uncounseled convictions or otherwise

we give more than the required full faith and credit to the

I'm sorry.

Are you saying you cannot give more than

the required full faith and credit to the earlier conviction?

18

Or rather, are you saying you must give the required full faith

19

and credit to the second action of the New York courts; namely,

Now there i-s a suggestion in the opinion of the

case does not apply in a capital murder case because it arose

It is not applied in Sam Johnson's case, but it is

permissible way for a state to behave.

upon.

Sam Johnson had not in fact been advised of his right to

12

appeal, and that therefore resentencing was appropriate under

13

the circumstances, and then that an appeal should follow.

14
15
16

But beyond that, they did not agree with our position
as to what should occur as a result.
Now the New York Court of Appeals, having ruled as it

17

did, as this Court is aware, the State of New York has now

18

filed a brief with this Court urging that as a matter of Full

19

Faith and Credit Law, and in part citing a New York State Court

20

of Appeals opinion which is far more on point than anything

21

that this Court has said in so many words, that the same full

22

faith and credit should be given in New York as New York gives

23

to other states' rulings.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY FLOYD ABRAMS, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER - RESUMED
MR. ABRAMS:

7
8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
There were two reasons relied upon primarily by the

10

Mississippi Supreme Court in its opinion denying post­

11

conviction relief; one procedural, one substantive.

12

advert briefly to each.

13
^

We'll resume where we were

I will

Procedurally, the thrust of the Mississippi opinion

14

was that the issues considered here and argued by me today were

15

not raised before the Mississippi Supreme Court on direct

16

appeal in the action, but only on post-conviction -- only at

17

the post-conviction stage.

18

There are answers in our brief.

I would rest at this

19

point in this oral argument on the Phillips case itself.

20

had nothing to say on direct appeal.

21

Phillips case that what we were to do was to go to New York, if

22

a New York conviction it was.

23

proper to do so.

24

at the time in Mississippi in all respects.

25

We

We had been told by the

That was what we did, and it was

We abided by the procedural rules in effect

Substantively, I have been thinking about my not too

21

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

persuasive answer to you, Mr. Chief Justice, in terms of citing

1
2

cases from this Court involving Full Faith and Credit which are

3

wholly applicable to the situation here.

4

Most of the cases that we rely upon in our brief

5

which are close are state cases.

6

states have, in our view, abided by their obligations under

7

Full Faith and Credit, and have therefore written the basic

8

opinions dealing with the scope of the clause in this area.

9

The reason for that is that

We cited the New York case, the Fairland Dairies

10

case, a California case, Oklahoma case.

1.1

are correct in their interpretation of federal law.

12
13

The closest cases from this Court are close only
because they set down general principles about Full Faith and
Credit:

)

We think those cases

Millikan v. Meyer, Wisconsin v. Pelican, old cases,

15

Pelican in particular, in terms of the theory of Full Faith and

16

Credit.

17

There is nothing contrary to those state cases that

18

we cite in terms of its articulation of Full Faith and Credit

19

law.

20

QUESTION:

Well, is there some other constitutional

21

reason based on — reason based on the federal constitution why

22

this conviction could not be used in this sentencing

OZ O

proceeding?

24
25

MR. ABRAMS:

Yes, the other reason is a due process

reason that this Court has in the Burgett case, in the Tucker

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

case, in the Townsend case, come down hard on lower courts,
state and federal, in which you have used -QUESTION:

Would you think you have a better chance

of winning on Full Faith and Credit than the due process?
MR. ABRAMS:
QUESTION:

I thought so coming in, but —
Well, at least you've got some cases in

this Court.
MR. ABRAMS:

I do have cases in this Court on that.

It seemed to me that those three cases are — those three cases
of this Court are right on point insofar as misleading or
prejudicial evidence, particularly evidence with respect to
reversed convictions.
QUESTION:

But you have no cases on Full Faith and

Credit.
MR. ABRAMS:

On Full Faith and Credit, in terms of

reversed criminal convictions, no.

It did seem to us that Full

Faith and Credit, and it still seems to us, a more serious
argument.

But those three cases are due process cases which I

cite to you.
QUESTION:

But weren't they all involving enhancement

statutes?
MR. ABRAMS:

They were enhancement cases, yes, yes,

and they were cases in which information which came before
state and federal courts was later stricken because it turned
out to be wrong just as hear.

23

Finally, this is not a case in which it could be said
2

that was is involved here is harmless error.

3

scope of that doctrine in the sentencing field, the Mississippi

4

Supreme Court itself explicitly assumed any finding of harmless

5

error in this case.

6

in which harmless error could play a role given the degree of

7

emphasis placed by the prosecutor on this single prior felony

8

conviction.

9

that this Court has sometimes considered.

Whatever the

We think this is not a case, in any event,

Justice, if I may.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY MARVIN L. WHITE, JR., ESQ.

. 15

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

16
17

Thank you, Mr. Abrams.

MR. WHITE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:

18

I think the case that we are presented for resolution

19

here today is similar to that found in Smith v. Murray that was

20

decided in 1986.

21

procedural bar and the questions of what must occur, if

22

anything, when one of several aggravating circumstances is

23

found used in support of a death penalty is later held invalid,

24

and then we have this twist of the Full Faith and Credit

25

argument also added to that particular part of it.

We have to be considered here questions of

24
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

In Smith, of course, the procedural bar was relied
on there, and the Court expressly declined to address the
question of what the invalidation of one aggravating
circumstance of several would affect -- how that would affect
the outcome of a sentencing decision there.
We think, though, that the Smith rationale is
applicable here, both on the issue of procedural bar as well as
the ultimate outcome of the case.
.

And just to step to the Full Faith and Credit

question a minute in this particular case, what we have is a
situation where the Mississippi Supreme Court looked at what
New York did and said that it did not, in effect, affect the
judgment of the sentence of death in this particular case.
The Petitioner amici here would have the Court adopt
a rule that it would require an automatic reversal or vacation
of a death sentence where an aggravating circumstance is later
found invalid.
Court.

This has not occurred in the past from this

The lower courts have held in various cases that this

does not result in an automatic reversal; that the court can
consider this.
And even without a harmless error analysis on this
type thing, the Fifth Circuit in Williams v. Maggio, and
Knighton v. Maggio, they only review -- in Louisiana, only
review one of several if there are several found; they only
review one.

They don't review the others.

25
Heritage Reporting Corporation

Has Mississippi in the past, when they

find one of several aggravating circumstances invalid, normally

remand it for a new trial?

MR. WHITE:

QUESTION:

10

1

So the appellate court does the reweighing

itself ?

7

9

No, it has not.

Yes, it does.
And if it finds that the valid aggravating

circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances, they
affirm?

MR. WHITE:

12

In this particular case, it is our contention that

They affirm, right.

13

they did do a proportionality review here, and say that the

death penalty was totally appropriate in this case without
considering the prior conviction in that particular part of the

opinion.

They did in the opinion say that it was supported by

QUESTION:

But they say,

"Even if we conceded that

19

the jury had no authority to consider this conviction, the

20

remaining to aggravating circumstances were sufficient to

21

support the jury's verdict."

22

Is that what you rely on?

23

MR. WHITE:

24

QUESTION:

25

That's what I am relying on, yes, sir.
You don't think they took that back a

couple of pages later?

It's hard to tell.

%

1

Well, they talk a lot about what the

2

effect of the New York vacation in that particular instance

3

were, but I think that we get to that point, and they say it

4

would not affect that, and we are relying on that that they

5

were correct in that the sentence of death would not be

6

disturbed because of the vacation of that New York sentence.

7
8

MR. WHITE:

QUESTION:

All this means that if you should lose

now, he still may receive the death penalty.
MR. WHITE:

Yes, sir.

He could be resentenced, a new

10

sentencing proceeding could be contrary to the amicus brief of

11

the City Bar of New York who said that it would have to be

12

sentence to life.

13

before a new jury and a new sentence of death could be imposed

14

if the jury saw fit to do so at that time.

15

He could be given a new sentencing hearing

QUESTION:

Mr. White, what's the language you rely

16

upon to say that the Mississippi court actually did a

17

reweighing?

18

It seems to me proportionality review is not the same

19

as reweighing.

It just means, you know, this jury verdict is

20

in accord with the run of the mind jury verdict.

21

MR. WHITE:

o9

QUESTION:

/L. £

Right.
Nor is the other statement you rely on

23

actually a redoing of the weighing by the Supreme Court.

It's

24

just saying even without this, there would be enough to support

25

the jury verdict.

That's not the same as saying, you know, if

27
Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

we had to call ourselves, we'd call it that way.

%
What language in the opinion leads you to believe

2
■>

J

that they did the reweighing here?
MR. WHITE:

4
5

And I would certainly agree that the statute, the way the

6

statute is written the court makes a finding of whether or not

7

the aggravating circumstances are supported by the record.

8

then they make a proportionality review of that case with other

9

cases, like cases.

10

j

Well, those are the thing we rely on.

And

And in this type thing, they sometimes do this

11

reweighing.

12

aggravating circumstances here do -- in fact, would not change

13

the outcome of this thing.

I think they are saying here that these

Wouldn't they say it would support an

MR. WHITE:

QUESTION:

That's right.
But that's a bit different from reweighing

it themselves and saying, well, you know, the jury goofed up

through no fault of their own because there was inadmissible

22

evidence.

23

thus and such.

They didn't really say that.

QUESTION:

-- before this one where it's clear that

the Mississippi Supreme Court does reweigh, where they have

expressly said, we do not -- when one of several aggravating

circumstances is invalidated, we do not necessarily send it

MR. WHITE:
QUESTION:
MR. WHITE:

They say -We will reweigh, and we find the -Well, they have never said they will not.

In fact, in Nixon they said that in the similar context.

You

know, if you want to bring this before us, you can bring it
before us, but it's not going to guarantee you a new sentencing
hearing, or even that we are going to vacate the death penalty.
QUESTION:
MR. WHITE:

Yes?
It is something we will consider at that

point to think, in our opinion whether a new sentencing hearing
is required.
QUESTION:
MR. WHITE:

Well, what did Irving hold?
Irving held the same thing.

It said that

they would consider it to determine whether or not a new
hearing -- but basically Irving's holding is that one -- the
invalidation of one aggravating circumstance does not vacate a
death sentence if it is supported by other valid circumstances
much the way that the -QUESTION:

Well, that's very good, but I mean that's

just what we are arguing about here.
MR. WHITE:
QUESTION:

Right.
The issue is it's clear that it doesn't

invalidate it if the court is reweighing in light of that
invalidation itself.

But it seems to me circular to simply

It's one thing to say we'll have the Supreme Court

it not been considering this improper factor.
And you're saying, well, that's too bad.

So long as

it is proportionate on appeal, we'll uphold it, and we won't
even have the Supreme Court redo the weighing.

That's quite a

different approach.
QUESTION:

The Mississippi Supreme Court is

interpreting its statute not to require reweighing.
MR. WHITE:
here.

I think maybe it is in some circumstances

I know the Fourth Circuit, in Smith v. Picunia, which is

the lower court case in Smith v. Murray, they did not apply a
harmless error test or a reweighing type situation there in
that.
And as I said, the Fifth Circuit regularly, out of
the cases out of Louisiana, they only review one aggravating
circumstance and don't even reach the others, whether they are
invalid or not, to determine whether or not relief could be
granted on one of these others.
QUESTION:

They only review one.

General White, isn't there involved in

this case still another problem though?
Suppose this conviction in New York had been set
aside before the sentencing hearing.

Would you not agree that

it would have been improper to put the trial court conviction
before the sentencing jury?
MR. WHITE:

I agree.

QUESTION:

o

MR. WHITE:

QUESTION:

It would be improper.
I agree.
So here if you say that we didn't know at

4

the time, the jury did consider evidence that we now know it

5

should not have considered.

6

MR. WHITE:

7

QUESTION:

Well, they did, yes.
So these other cases where you invalidate

8

an aggravating circumstance usually the evidence supporting the

9

circumstance is properly before the jury, and the question

10

really is whether it was entitled to have the label aggravating

11

circumstance attached to it.

12

MR. WHITE:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. WHITE:

Yes.

Well —

But this is a little different, I think.
Well, it's like the situation in Smith v.

15

Picunia, or Smith v. Murray, and your dissent in that case

16

where there was a Fifth Amendment violation.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

Of course, that was a procedural bar case

rather than -MR. WHITE:

A procedural bar case, but your dissent,

20

of course, said the procedural bar should not be applied, and

21

that the Fifth Amendment violation relating to one of the

22

aggravating circumstances should vitiated the whole -- the

23

death penalty and a new sentencing hearing was conducted.

different than it is in Georgia or Louisiana where you have the

aggravating circumstances not being constitutionally reguired.

The Mississippi statute is just like -- for all practical

purposes -- like the statute in Louisiana in which this Court

circumstances are not constitutionally reguired in the

the death sentence.

24
25

So I think that looking at it in that context the
aggravating circumstances serve a state law purpose here, and

36
Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

not a constitutional purpose, because under Lowenfield the

2

finding of guilty of a murder of a policeman in this case was

3

adequate to impose the death penalty without the consideration

4

of aggravating circumstances in Mississippi as it was in

5

Louisiana, and this was not part of the constitutional required

6

narrowing process.

QUESTION:

But Lowenfield did not involve a situation

8

in which the defendant's claim is the jury -- he could not

9

possibly have said the jury wouldn't have reached the result it

10

did, and that's the situation here.

11

that this jury wouldn't have given this man the death sentence

12

had that evidence been excluded.

13

MR. WHITE:

14

QUESTION:

15

There is a plausible claim

Certainly.
Now that situation didn't exist in

Lowenfield.

16

MR. WHITE:

17

QUESTION:

That's right.
All the stuff that went before the jury

18

was directly before them, and they made the decision on the

19

basis of all of that.

20

terribly persuasive on the precise point here.

21

MR. WHITE:

So, you know, I don't find Lowenfield

Well, it says, though, that it's not

22

required.

23

law there, and I think we have to make that argument that the

24

state law ground of that, and our court interpreted that that

25

not to require reversal in this case.

The aggravating circumstances are a matter of state

QUESTION:

Are you saying they are not

constitutionally required by the federal constitution?
MR. WHITE::
QUESTION:
trial.

That's right.
Well, let's take the normal criminal

Let's say a certain crime is defined to require, I

don't know, putting three bullets in the individual, and that's
certainly not required that you define the crime to have that
element.

But nonetheless, if that element is not proven, we

wouldn't uphold a conviction and simply saying, well, it wasn't
federally required that you have that element.
MR. WHITE:
QUESTION:

I agree, I agree with that.
Here the state didn't have to require the

jury to find all this, but it did.
MR. WHITE:
QUESTION:

It did.
And we don't know that the jury actually

found it, or properly found it.
MR. WHITE:

But we would basically rely, though, on

the proportionality review there in the readings of Zant and
Barclay and Goode in that when this proportionality review is
made, even in light of an invalidated aggravated circumstances
or invalid circumstance, that this review that the invalidation
of this aggravating circumstance here does not make the penalty
arbitrary, or freakish, or capricious, nor is it excessive or
disproportionate in this case.
And the narrowing done by the jury there I think was

sufficient, and the other two aggravating circumstances relied

on, and as found by the Supreme Court, would certainly outweigh

QUESTION:

Would you clear up one thing for me?

I

kind of got myself mixed up in this argument.
If this instead of being a capital case had been a

7

habitual offender case, and you had the same sequence of events

8

that you had here, would the sentence -- the enhanced sentence

9

be reduced in Mississippi?

10

%

this later invalidated --

MR. WHITE:

It could be.

If let us say in an

lJ

enhanced sentencing situation under the habitual offender

12

statute all you have to prove is the existence of the prior.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. WHITE:

Right.
You have to prove two, or sometimes the

15

prosecutor will go and prove three, and this is before the

16

judge only.

17

sentenced to life without parole, or the maximum sentence

18

without parole, depending upon which statute you are under.

19

Upon the proof of two, he is eligible to be

There you don't have this process as the court below

20

pointed out, this process of the jury then looking at all of

21

the factors here.

22

he is entitled -- the judge is entitled to impose the maximum

23

sentence, whether it be the maximum number of years or life.

24

So you have a greater involvement in that case of the, or play

25

of the use of a prior conviction.

Just on the proof of that prior conviction

QUESTION:

But if it were set aside in the same time

sequence that we had here, normally the trial judge would take

a second look at the sentence then.
MR. WHITE:

5

Well, it wouldn't go back to the trial

judge.

QUESTION:

7

MR. WHITE:

Or would it automatically -The procedure in Mississippi, of course,

8

is that once something is appealed to the Mississippi Supreme

9

Court, it goes back to that court for an application to proceed

10

in the lower court.

n

particular case here, this did not go back to a trial court for

12

a hearing.

13

Supreme Court, and without sending it back for a hearing before

14

the lower court.

15

And so the Supreme Court, just as in this

This was considered en banc by the Mississippi

QUESTION:

I'm still not clear on -- had this not

16

been a capital case and been an enhance sentencing case, and

17

you had the same sequence of events, say one of the two prior

18

convictions was set side as this one was after the sentencing,

19

would there be a new sentencing either by the Mississippi

20

Supreme Court or by the trial court?

21

22

MR. WHITE:
would be reduced.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. WHITE:

25

In that case he would be -- the sentence

It would be reduced.
It would be reduced.

There would not be

a chance under that situation because they have applied.

Our

evidence -QUESTION:

3

There would be no Mississippi procedural

4

bar to a reduction of the sentence in this same time sequence.

5

That's what I am trying to get to.
MR. WHITE:

6

I don't know that.

I mean we haven't had

7

that presented in this case.

Both in Phillips and in Nixon,

8

the issue of the invalidity of the sentence was raised on

9

direct appeal.

And both Phillips and Nixon are direct appeal

cases .

11

said, we're not going to consider it here on this direct

appeal.

13

we're not going to -- you know, you go and tell us.

14

They are not post-conviction cases where the court

You have raised the validity on direct appeal, but

And in fact, in Phillips on the direct appeal, he had

already filed in petition in Kentucky and had the sentence set

we're not going to fool with this on direct appeal.

The Kentucky Court of

ORAL ARGUMENT BY FLOYD ABRAMS, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

MR. ABRAMS:

It is not our position in this case that

10

there should be an automatic reversal when an aggravating

11

circumstance is held invalid.

12

question.

13
■s

Thank you, Mr. White.

This Court has dealt with that

Our position here is that when bad evidence comes

14

before a jury, misleading evidence, prejudicial evidence,

15

evidence which counsel, General White now concedes could not

16

have come before the jury had the reversal occurred earlier,

17

that that is the circumstance in which the death penalty cannot

18

be upheld because it cannot be said that it would have occurred

19

but for the bad evidence.

20

QUESTION:

-- competent constitutionally to reweigh

21

the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating and

22

affirm?

23
24
25

MR. ABRAMS:

I would say, first of all, that is not

what the court did in this case as a constitutional matter.
QUESTION:

Well, that's your reading of this opinion.

42
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

MR. ABRAMS:

Yes, sir, it is my reading of this

opinion on two separate basis.
QUESTION:
MR. ABRAMS:

First of all --

Well, how about my question now?
Right.

Yes, it would be, my answer to

your question directly, that that sort of reweighing in this
circumstance, in a situation in which a jury had free rein to
determine how much to weigh mitigating circumstances against
aggravating circumstances, and the jury is instructed, as in
this case, that it could weigh in effect the mitigating
circumstances as much as they wanted the aggravating.

That in

that sort of situation where the jury did that, that it would
raise very serious constitutional issues for the state Supreme
Court to engage in the reweighing.
QUESTION:

What constitutional provision would be

violated?
MR. ABRAMS:
violated.

I believe the Eighth Amendment would be

Now this Court has not addressed that issue yet,

because it hasn't had to address that issue yet.
But in a situation -- I mean we have a situation here
where the scope of review of the Mississippi Supreme Court is
not one which asks anything more than whether a jury could have
done that.

I mean the court is not substituting its views for

that, or affirming the views of the jury in Mississippi.

It is

addressing a much narrower issue.
In Mississippi v. Caldwell, the sort of language used

43
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

in Justice O'Connor's opinion, for example, was was it so
arbitrary that it was against the overwhelming weight of the
evidence.

I mean that's the role of the jury in Mississippi.

For the state Supreme Court then to engage in the first
instance in a weighing process where it has not heard any of
the evidence and cannot assess the in-court evidence, I would
argue to you, if that was before you, is barred by the Eighth
Amendment.
But I would urge upon you that that question is not
before you.

There was no reweighing here.

The proportionality

review, for example, was at the time of the direct appeal.
QUESTION:
MR. ABRAMS:

I'm not taking about proportionality.
Yes, sir.

Right.

And I would just urge

upon you that it is my reading, at least, that they did not
engage in that and could not.
So in the end then, we would urge upon you that this
situation is the question reserved by the court in Zant.
not Zant, or Barclay, or Lowenfield.

It is

If this were Lowenfield

and this sort of information had come before the jury, we might
well make the same argument.

I mean if this were the

Lowenfield case itself and the jury in that case had heard
evidence pressed by counsel of a reversed conviction, we would
be urging upon you that in that type of situation you should
reverse, and that's what we urge upon you today.
Thank you.
