CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Number 86-1415, Evelyn Marino v. Juan Ortiz.

We'll hear argument now In

Mr. Podolsky, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD PODOLSKY, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PODOLSKY:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case deals with the rights of a party to seek

10
11

redress of grievances for an alleged violation of the

12

Fourteenth Amendment, Equal Protection Under The Laws, under 42

13

USC 1983, and whether that right is in any way delimited or in

14

any way proscribed by the fact that somebody else started an

15

action relating to a related condition.

16

The Evelyn Marino Petitioners are police officers who

17

took the 1983 New York City Police Department promotion exam to

18

sergeant.

QUESTION:

The calendar year 1983 and not the code

number 1983.

21

MR. PODOLSKY:

No.

I'm sorry.

Yes, Your Honor.

22

The pass mark for that examination was set at the

23

first thousand candidates plus ties and yielded a list of 1,040

24

candidates.

the fairness hearing held in the Hispanic case that the pass

mark did not define minimum competency to do the job and this

2

was in response to an objection by certain intervenors who

3

represented ethnic societies that the — to promote the

4

minority officers would somehow lead to promoting unqualified

5

people.

6

So,

the issue of whether or not the minority

7

beneficiaries of the settlement are qualified has been decided

8

and is not in issue here.

9

The Marino Petitioners have a mark equivalent to or

10

higher than the minority beneficiaries of the settlement but

11

below the first thousand cut-off.

12

employed, after the Hispanic suit was instituted and settled,

13

it turned out that everyone on the list,

14

original passers, plus all minority members who would make up

15

the disparate impact perceived to have generated the lawsuit in

16

the first place were promoted,

17

in the rank.

18

When the racial remedy was

there were still 400 vacancies

The Marino Petitioners take the position that as long

19

as there were 400 vacancies in the rank,

20

employment of the racial remedy was not narrowly tailored to

21

prevent unnecessary trammeling of rights, and that is the issue

22

that brought Marino into court in the first place.

PODOLSKY:

the Title VII litigation, Your Honor, because Congress has

provided a remedy of 42 USC 1983 to deal with alleged violation

of equal protection,

It was an alternate remedy and not a

Not a required remedy.

8

Now, if we looked at, Your Honor, —

9

QUESTION:

So, why didn't you?

10

MR. PODOLSKY:

11

QUESTION:

12

What?

Why did the Petitioners not intervene in

the Title VII litigation?

13

MR. PODOLSKY:

They did not intervene because they

14

chose as their remedy a plenary action under 42 USC 1983 which

15

is a remedy provided for Congress specifically addressed to

16

enforcing the equal protection component of the Fourteenth

17

Amendment.
QUESTION:

18

I think Justice O'Connor is trying to find

19

out why.

20

She is asking why they chose this instead of the other.

21

there some reason?

22

23
24
25

She knows that they chose this instead of the other.

MR. PODOLSKY:

Is

Yes, indeed, there are a number of

reasons cataloged in my reply brief, Your Honor.
The most important one, of course, is that the remedy
existed in 1983.

The second, if a party chooses to intervene

in somebody else's lawsuit,

2

on some — in many respects from the 1983 action.

3

The 2nd Circuit,

their burden of proof is different

for example, sometimes limits

4

intervenors to just whether or not there's a fairness in the

5

proposed settlement.
Now, in 1983, you don't have to go into whether or

6

7

not the racial remedy was or was not appropriate.

One of the

8

most important considerations, Your Honor, in answer to your

9

question is that the intervention provision, Federal Rule of

10

Civil Procedure 24, I believe, and I think the 11th Circuit

11

bears me out, is for people that have no other remedy.

12

Now, for example, the Schneider intervenors, they

13

represented the ethnic societies, were they attempting to get a

14

passing grade here?

15

No.

16

lower the mark for the beneficiaries of the settlement, we are

17

going to be supervised by unqualified people.

18

No.

Were they attempting to get promoted?

Their objection was we are police officers, and if you

statute giving rise to a plenary action.

22

No remedy, no specific

Now, the Marino people, they brought their action and

23

it was dismissed as an impermissible collateral attack on a

24

proposed settlement, not a judgment, a proposed settlement.

25

Where did the 2nd Circuit get the idea of impermissible

verbiage of the Rule 19.

That's the

Rule 19 makes it the duty of the people who feel

they're going to be subjected to duplication of effort to

inconsistent results.

6

asserts a claim, not has a claim, Rule 19 says a person who

7

claims an interest in an action, which may lead to inconsistent

results, the people who are at risk, the parties who may be

subjected to inconsistent results, have a duty, not the people

It puts the burden on them when somebody

a duty to plead, to join, and let's see how strong that

12

requirement is.

remedies that Congress gave me for vindicating the unequal

protection of the laws where people of similar qualifications

were excluded unnecessarily.

QUESTION:

Well, but, now, Mr. Podolsky,

Section

1983 action that you've said you brought, you chose to bring,

24

isn't there for invoking New York's definition of equal

protection law, it's to vindicate a federal constitutional
12

Heritage Reporting Corporation

2

claim?
MR. PODOLSKY:

That's right.

And the federal

3

constitutional claim is that citizens be accorded equal

4

protection of the law.

5

QUESTION:

Yes, that's fine. But why the long

6

discourse about what New York — how New York interprets equal

7

protection of the law?

8

MR. PODOLSKY:

They define it for the purposes of,

9

and so does the Court, so does the Federal Court, in defining

10

what equal protection is in a state. They rely on the state's

11

statutes and highest tribunal decisions, and it has been held

12

that that can be binding on this Court.

13

Justice O'Connor has suggested in her concurring

14

opinion, of course, in the Cleveland Firefighters case, that

15

consent decrees

16

violate the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection component.

23

Now, in order for something

For example, the

If a statute violates it, it's inconsistent and is

A statute, which is violated by

Well, it's been on for awhile. Now,

I'm really in trouble.
In any event, six months after the final decree is

19

entered, the state Supreme Court comes down with a decision

20

giving me eleven changes on the merits of whether the questions

21

were job-related or not, and I wrote in my brief what Judge

22

Blin said about the case.

23

As a result of these changes, some of the very

24

minorities perceived to have failed and made sergeants under

the decree now had a passing grade on their own merit.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear now from you, Mr. Nager.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GLEN D. NAGER

18
19

AS AMICUS CURIAE,

20

MR. NAGER:

21

Thank you, Mr. Podolsky.

IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Justice O'Connor has asked a question that probably

22
23

occurred to all of us, why didn't the Petitioners in this case

24

intervene.

25

The fact that that question occurs to all of us,
16

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

though, is a question that we would like to suggest is not a

2

question that the District Court should be asking of litigants

3

who bring subsequent lawsuits, challenging actions that existed

4

in prior lawsuits, and our reason for that is it would be both

5

unfair and would produce an inefficient allocation of society's

6

and judicial resources in the subsequent lawsuits.

7

It is certainly the case that it's in the interest of

8

fairness and in the interest of judicial economy for everyone

9

who has a sufficient interest in a piece of litigation to be

10

made party of that litigation and be bound by that litigation.

11

But it's also true that the same fairness concerns and those

12

same economy concerns counsel that when a person doesn't have a

13

sufficient interest in a piece of litigation, that he not be

14

made party and that he not participate in it because his

15

participation would confuse and complicate the litigation

16

needlessly.

17

The problem comes — and it's easy to say those two

18

generalities in the abstract, what's more difficult is

19

analyzing the question as to whether or not you have a

20

sufficient interest to justify being a party in that

21

litigation, and until a court answers that question for you,

22

you won't know, and the problem is that there is

23

error of mistake, and the question should be who can best bear

24

the burden of those mistakes of thinking I didn't have a

25

sufficient interest to intervene, so I didn't, or I had other
17

Heritage Reporting Corporation

a risk of

1

reasons for not intervening, and I didn't want to, and the

2

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure wisely, we think, --

3

QUESTION:

May I interrupt?

Is it conceivable that

4

you would have a sufficient interest to mount a collateral

5

attack on a judgment in a case and yet not have a sufficient

6

interest to intervene in the case?

MR. NAGER:

QUESTION:

MR. NAGER:

Probably not, Justice Stevens.
Thank you.
The question, though, is should that

question be asked of someone who doesn't intervene, and we

11

would suggest that it would be inefficient to create a rule of

12

law of that sort.

13

have counsel on an on-going basis and aren't in the position of

14

monitoring on-going litigation.

15

The reason being is that many people don't

If that litigation may be effecting their interests

16

and the fact that they haven't intervened may mean that they

17

didn't have counsel at the time who told them.

18

about the litigation.

19

They may know

They may not understand the litigation.

The Rules of Federal Procedure say put the burden on

20

the parties to the litigation. If they want to bind those

21

people who haven't intervened, then join them.

22

burden the Rule 19 places, and we think it's a wise one because

23

it would be inefficient for all of us to have to continually

24

retain counsel to evaluate litigation to know whether or not we

25

should intervene.

MR. NAGER:

But they had to do that to decide whether

Well, they did, but the question is when.

Here, after they learned about the lawsuit, -QUESTION:

5

Well, normally, you start the time clock

6

running when you get notice of whatever it is that hurts you,

they realized that it adversely affected their interest, and

they must have been intimately acquainted with what was going

11

12

They all took the exam. It's not like they're some

MR. NAGER:

That's true, Justice Stevens. They aren't

13

strangers from a foreign country, and they were aware of the

14

litigation, and when you look at the — and they had counsel.

15

A lot of people don't have counsel. Yet, they may still know

16

that the litigation is going on and they may not know that they

17

have to intervene, and they shouldn't have to intervene.

18

If they don't intervene, what you have is you have

19

these kinds of cases where we're looking back in retrospect

20

asking whether or not they had sufficient notice, whether or

21

not at the time they had that notice the court had jurisdiction

22

over them, and whether or not their interest was sufficiently

23

implicated in retrospect to have required them to have

24

intervened to protect their rights.

25

The parties to the litigation, however, are more
19

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

familiar with the complaints, more familiar with the pleadings,

2

more familiar with the relief that they expect to ask the court

3

to award or in the case of the consent decree to approve, and

4

they're in the best position of bearing the burden of not

5

having made someone a party to the litigation.

6

It will expend judicial resources, we think, more in

7

the long run to engage in these inquiry, retrospective

8

inquiries as to whether or not someone has sufficient notice to

9

have required them to have intervened and thus they're

10

precluded from not having intervened.

11

Now, from just placing the burden on the existing

12

parties to the lawsuit to file a Rule 19(c) which says that

13

they should list everyone who may have an interest and is

14

affected by the litigation so that the court can evaluate

15

whether or not those litigants should be joined.

18

QUESTION:

When did it become clear that the

interests of — these interests would be threatened?
MR. NAGER:

Well, when the complaint was filed, the

19

city defendants clearly understood that it would affect the

20

interests of individuals who were already on the eligibility

21

list because they pled and asked that the case be dismissed for

22

failure to enjoin.

23

We believe that the first time at which it would have

24

been clear, probably clear,

that the Petitioners'

25

were affected would have been at the time that the court
20

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

interests

3

approved, I believe it was in November of 1985, a race­

2

conscious implementation of provisional promotions.

3

At that time, —

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. NAGER:

When was the consent decree?
Well, the consent decree itself was not

6

entered until June of '86, but there were provisional

7

promotions entered pursuant to interim orders of the court, and

8

that was the first instance at which race-conscious relief was

9

entered, and that would have been at the first time at which

10

the equal protection rights of Mr. Podolsky's clients could

11

have been implicated.
QUESTION:

12

Couldn't the consent decree as finally

13

entered been implemented in a way that wouldn't have hurt his

14

clients?

15

MR. NAGER:

This particular consent decree had

16

already hurt his clients because they had already been not

17

given a promotion that other individuals were given a

18

promotion, only because of their race. These -- all of his

19

clients were equal to or higher than one or more of the

20

minorities who were given the promotion on the eligibility

21

list.

22

23

QUESTION:

When was this action brought, the 1983

action brought?

24

MR. NAGER:

The initial 1983 action was filed, I

25

believe, in December of 1985.

Well, Mr. Nager, assuming not this case,

have lawyers, the parties have met and they decide to ride

that they could intervene at that stage?

they're complaining about is not simply that other people were

24
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

MR. NAGER:

1

That occurred some time after, I believe,

2

some time after the implementation of the provisional

3

promotions, which would have been some time after November of

4

1985 .

5

But as we read their complaint, Justice Scalia, they

6

have challenged the fact that they were at a certain point on

7

the eligibility list and they were not given promotions at the

8

same time that people who were lower than they were on the

9

promotion list were promoted and that the distinguishing factor

10

11
12

between them was solely and exclusively race.
QUESTION:

And they would have made the same claim if

there had not been these extra 400 slots?

13

MR. NAGER:

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes.

No, they wouldn't have made that claim.

15

mean, what maybe rankles with these people, even though they

16

might have had a lawsuit, they wouldn't have brought the

17

lawsuit except the fact that there were 400 places left.

MR. NAGER:

As I say, as we read the complaint, I can

only tell you what I think they're claiming from their

complaint, and Mr. Podolsky is their lawyer, he may take a

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD J. KOERNER, ESQ.

2

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

3
4

MR. KOERNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

5

Every circuit in the country, with the exception of

6

one, has upheld the principle against collateral attacks, and

7

the reason for that, as Justice Marshall indicated, is in the

8

interest of judicial economy, to avoid inconsistent results,

9

and also to put a case to rest.

10

11

The absence of finality would be most devastating to
Title VII litigation.

If you review the Birmingham, Alabama,

12

13

QUESTION:

But, Mr. Koerner, you could get finality

14

once the rules are established just as surely by using the

15

procedures of Rule 19 as by using the rules of procedure 24,

16

couldn't you?

17

MR. KOERNER:

Your Honor is quite correct, and what

18

we are urging is that there are policy considerations in this

19

type of litigation that make the literal application of Rule 19

20

inappropriate,

21

isolation, that it must be considered along with other rules,

22

including the rules of intervention.

23

in that we believe Rule 19 is not to be read in

With respect to inconsistent judgments, as Justices

24

judgments could not co-exist.

QUESTION:

5

of this class who's typical of the whole class, and I've been

6

watching this proceeding go on, and I see that race-conscious

7

relief is being given, but I say, you know, well, these people

8

have been discriminated against for years, that's fine, you

9

know, they're going to let them promote eight even though I had

How do we know when they decided that they
Let's assume that I'm one of the members

a higher grade, that's okay.

11

But, then, one day, I found out that there are 400

12

vacancies still left, and, doggone it, the city is not being

13

required to even use those 400 vacancies to promote me.

14

only at that point that I'm mad enough to want to bring a

15

lawsuit.

It's

16

Why do you want to compel me to get in at the moment

17

that I see that there's any legal interest of mine that can at

18

all be affected?

19

promote litigation or what?

20

Why do you want to make me do that for?

MR. KOERNER:

No.

To

Because, Your Honor, any relief

21

that we granted that class would have affected the consent

22

decree, because assuming there were vacancies, there were two

23

considerations.

24
25

First, would the city have consented to this consent
decree if it understood that it would have to make all these
27
Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

additional appointments and foreclose opportunities for people

2

taking the next sergeant's exam?
Second, with respect to this group, if we did appoint

3
4

this group and the vast majority of which were non-minorities,

5

based on the quota, we would then have to appoint additional

6

minorities to preserve the very quota that we established.
QUESTION:

7
8

Why have to intervene when there is any

interest —
MR. KOERNER:

9

QUESTION:

10

In any case?

In any case, what is the test?

If I have

11

any interest affected or only if I have an interest affected

12

that I care enough about that I'm willing to bring a lawsuit?
MR. KOERNER:

13

In this particular case, we would say

14

in answer to your question that you have to intervene from that

15

moment in time when you believe that a consent decree could be

16

entered in that case and when your cause of action arises

17

solely from the consent decree.
If it's the W.R. Grace issue, where you're asserting

18
19

an independent contractual right, we would not argue you have

20

to intervene.

21

your issue, although I wanted to deal with the bigger issue, I

22

would like to go over the chronology here, so you understand

23

this is not a case of someone who was surprised and sought to

24

bring a new action because they felt they were being treated

25

unfairly.

But I think if I could, Your Honor, to address

28

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

This is a case of someone who sat on a sideline,

1

2

participated in a limited way in the consent decree litigation,

3

and then brought a separate action which had no other effect

4

than to sow confusion on the issue.

5

In 1984, when the Title VII litigation was commenced,

6

at the same time this same attorney had been retained by the

7

same Petitioners to bring a state court proceeding to challenge

8

the answers selected by the Department of Personnel.

9

succeeded and showed that his answers were as good as or better

If he

10

than the answers selected by the Department of Personnel, it

11

was quite likely that a significant number of people that he

12

represents would be on the very eligible list that was already

13

involved in the consent decree litigation.

14

As the discovery phase was proceeding, the

15

Petitioners had every obligation to monitor it closely because

16

they knew part of their group would always be affected.

17

Indeed,

18

entered establishing a quota for the first time, the

19

Petitioners were aware of it.

20

them because to the extent a quota was granted — was effected,

21

it would have affect their individuals because they had scored

22

equal to or better than all the people who were the recipients

23

of the quota.

24
25

in the end of November, when the interim order was

But,

Then, they knew it would affect

instead of intervening, they brought a federal

1983 action, alleging the same operative facts and the same
29

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

cause of action as was involved in the consent decree action.

2

3

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Koerner, that action was brought

before the consent decree was filed, and --

4

MR. KOERNER:

5

QUESTION:

Your Honor, that is correct.

-- it seems to me that given the mandatory

6

language of Title 19, it's difficult for me to see at that

7

point why the burden shouldn't fall on the parties in the Title

8

VII litigation to force a mandatory intervention if they wanted

9

i t.

10

11

I just fail to see why the burden should be on these
people to intervene.

12

MR. KOERNER:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. KOERNER:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. KOERNER:

Your Honor, in answer —

You had notice.
We had notice.

So, why didn't you force them to join?
Because we believed that all the people

17

that had a substantial interest in the litigation were already

18

there. There had been three separate interventions by

19

representatives of non-minorities who were on the eligible list

20

in addition to the Plaintiffs and the City Defendants.

21

In addition, when they filed their federal complaint,

22

we moved to dismiss telling them that the law of the 2nd

23

Circuit at that time was you could not collaterally attack and

24

that since your complaint was filed after the first interim

25

order and since the object of the complaint would be to render
30

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

a judgment which would be inconsistent with any judgment

2

rendered in the consent decree litigation, we suggested to them

3

that they intervene.

4

What was —

5

QUESTION:

6

the duty,

7

was your concern.

8

9

Yes, but you had under Title 19 language,

to get them to intervene and get that settled if that

MR. KOERNER:

That is correct.

If it was feasible

and if we believed they had a substantial enough interest to

10

warrant their compulsory participation in the case.

11

their interest?

12

no expectancy of employment appointments.

13

What was

They were not on the eligible list. They had

All they were -- they were in the exact same position

14

before the consent decree was entered as after. Their only

15

injury was the same injury as any other non-minority in

16

effectuating a quota.

17

is that it was given only to the victims of discrimination.

18

QUESTION:

What makes this quota even more limited

You are just saying that their interest is

19

not a valid one, but Rule 19 says that you should join if

20

feasible a party if the party claims an interest relating to

21

the subject of the action.

22

Now, you knew as soon as that other suit was filed

23

that these parties claimed an interest. Whether the interest

24

was valid or not doesn't make any difference as far as Rule 19

25

is concerned.

You're just telling us it wasn't a valid one.
31

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

MR. KOERNER:

1

We're also telling you that in cases

2

like this, it ought to be up to the participants in the

3

collateral attack to determine where to go.

4

May I just finish, Your Honor?

5

In addition, they did participate.

After we told

6

them to intervene, Justice O'Connor, this also applies to your

7

question, after we told them to intervene, they filed both

8

written and oral objections to the consent decree. They did

9

everything but formally file a motion.

10

So, the question is whether the state of mind of all

11

the parties, which included the intervenors as such, that they

12

would have thought that all of this participation and the

13

contestation of the objections was not enough, and I submit to

14

you that we did act reasonably.

15

participated. Indeed, after this case was concluded, they filed

16

a notice of appeal and argued they were a party to the

17

litigation.

18

We thought they had

Based on what we should have expected and what they

19

did, I think the participants here acted quite reasonably. Did

20

we treat him fairly?

21

was in the 2nd Circuit. He knew he couldn't collaterally

22

attack.

23

whether he wanted --

24
25

I believe so.

We told him what the law

It was up to him, it would appear to us, to determine

QUESTION:

Mr. Koerner, you've used the term

"collateral attack" several times.
I suppose all of these
32
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

terms may have a certain pejorative connotation, but ordinarily

2

collateral attacks suggest that you're attacking something that

3

you're a party to, doesn't it?

4

MR. KOERNER:

No.

Our position would be, Your Honor,

5

if you have an obligation to intervene, because of the

6

circumstances of the case, and you fail to exercise that

7

obligation, you can be precluded in another litigation from

8

litigating the issues that arise —

9
10

11

QUESTION:

And what case from this Court most closely

supports that —
MR. KOERNER:

Provident Bank and the PennCentral

12

Merger and Inclusion cases, and that philosophy was upheld by

13

three circuits.

14

QUESTION:

I asked you about cases from this Court.

15

MR. KOERNER:

Both cases. They suggested that because

16

of the nature of the transactions, the complexity of the

17

litigation, there can come to be a point where it is reasonable

18

to believe that people who have tenuous interests at most

19

should have an obligation to intervene, and we believe in this

20

situation, when we called to his attention the law of the

21

circuit and told him that this was an indirect impermissible

22

attack, I won't use the word "collateral", and when he did, in

23

fact, participate through the objection process and when his

24

cause of action arose directly out of the consent decree, —

25

QUESTION:

Doesn't part of your answer depend on the
33

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

2

correctness of the 2nd Circuit's rule in Prate?
MR. KOERNER:

No, no. It just — it tells — no.

3

We're not arguing that Prate was decided correctly, although we

4

believe it was.

5

an attorney who was familiar with the process and having

6

participated to some limited degree in our consent decree

7

litigation, there was no reason for him not to intervene,

8

except to create confusion, when he had every reason to suspect

9

that his indirect attack would not be successful.

10

We are just pointing out that having retained

QUESTION:

Would the rule you're urging here be

11

different if the 2nd Circuit had come out exactly the opposite

12

in the Prate case? I mean, it seems to me part of your answer

13

is based on the correctness of the 2nd Circuit's ruling.

14

MR. KOERNER:

No.

In effect, if the 2nd Circuit had

15

said collateral attacks would be okay under the circumstances,

16

we would still argue that under the facts of this case, that it

17

would have been inappropriate for him to participate as an

18

objector and then bring another proceeding without attacking

19

head-on the consent decree litigation.

20

But if the 2nd Circuit had issued a different opinion

21

in Prate, it might jeopardize the general rule, which is

22

thought to be an issue before this Court now, and that is

23

whether a collateral attack will ever be permissible in Title

24

If I might, I'd like to address the broader issue

With respect to the nature of the process, in all of

carry Petitioner's argument forward, we would have had to been

required to intervene at least ten thousand non-minority

But public policy can't say that courts

1

MR. KOERNER:

No, but public policy has caused courts

2

to construe procedural statutes in a way as not to do an

3

injustice to the policies set forth in the statute you're

4

trying to interpret.

5

If, by removing finality from the cause of action,

you so undermine consent decree litigation that you frustrate

Title VII, then it would appear to me you should consider not

In addition, --

15

QUESTION:

But, Mr. Koerner, you don't know a lot of

16

times during the course of litigation that it's going to end up

17

in a consent decree, do you?

18

MR. KOERNER:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

No.

So, what judgments do you make before you

know how the suit is finally going to be disposed of?
MR. KOERNER:

Our argument, Your Honor, presumes that

22

the parties who are aggrieved have actual notice of the

23

litigation and the consent decree problem and had an

24

opportunity to intervene.

25

QUESTION:

So, does this mean that their lawsuit must

have been filed after the consent decree?

2

MR. NAGER:

3

QUESTION:

In this case?
No.

What if a person half-way through

4

litigation like this files an independent 1983 action and you

5

object to it, you say he ought to have intervened, and he says

6

I have no idea whether there's going to be a consent decree or

7

not in the main case?

8

9

MR. KOERNER:

Yes.

That would be a tougher case and

would not as clearly fall within collateral attack, but in this

10

case, the only differentiation between filing it after the

11

final judgment and the facts here is that he filed it after the

12

interim order.

13

He knew the consent decree was an issue.

More importantly, after his case was dismissed in

14

April, he still had two months to move to intervene and ask for

15

an adjournment on the consent decree and present his arguments

16

on the merits.

17

We do not believe that once you get wind that you are

18

negotiating consent decree that merely by the filing of a

19

complaint you can interrupt the consent decree judgment and

20

effect all the policy reasons why you want consent decrees in

21

the first place.

22

QUESTION:

Well, it doesn't interrupt the consent

23

decree judgment, but the consent decree doesn't bind people who

24

are not parties to the suit.

25

MR. KOERNER:

Your Honor, I understand your position,
37
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

and in private litigation, that is the case, and in public

2

litigation, that could be the case, but there are circumstances

3

under which, because of the nature of the interests and because

4

the parties are so numerous, that it could be the understanding

5

of all the parties and the court that if people believe they

6

had a sufficient interest in the controversy, they would

7

intervene under the circumstances.

8

9

Indeed, if you'll look at the survey of cases
throughout the country, the reason why collateral attacks have

10

been uniformly rejected, except for one Circuit that I'll

11

discuss in a minute, is because of the protracted process of

12

Title VII litigation, and the fact that all interested people

13

do participate, that because the numbers of people affected are

14

so numerous, they do not have any trouble retaining an attorney

15

and this case is an example.

16

He sued in state court.

He brought a 1983 action.

17

He certainly was retained for all purposes and he could have

18

every easily participated in the litigation.

19

The 11th Circuit in Jefferson County, where they have

20

recognized collateral attacks, the result has been a quota that

21

has been under attack for over ten years.

Despite the fact

22

that the people who are now attacking the

quota stand in no

23

different position than the people who were aggrieved at the

24

inception of the quota.

25

everybody else is affected, that when you hire minorities, you
38
Heritage Reporting Corporation

They're affected by the quota the way

(202) 628-4888

1

exclude non-minorities.

2

But that has been upheld.

It's a rational exercise of

3

the power of the lower court, and there is no reason to permit

4

the constant challenges when you do have a reasonable

5

alternative and that is intervention.
I want to deal with the second issue because although

The Circuit Court, and we believe correctly, that

since Mr. Podolsky never chose to become a party through his

well established in this Court.

to make.

21

makes his practices more incomprehensible is that a notice of

appeal was also filed by the one intervenor that did not

He withdrew that appeal. So, Mr. Podolsky knew that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

the only other non-minority party on appeal had withdrawn.

2

Despite that, he still did not move to intervene in the

3

Appellate Court and ask for permission, and we believe that

4

what he has done here has placed himself in the middle of

5

nowhere and that there was an easy avenue of approach which he

6

chose not to use, and for all those reasons, we ask that the

7

orders be affirmed.
