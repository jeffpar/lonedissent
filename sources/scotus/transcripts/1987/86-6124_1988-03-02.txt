CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument now in

Number 86-6124, George S. Bennett v. Arkansas.
Mr. Carpenter, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. CARPENTER, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. CARPENTER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The issue before the Court today is whether a federal

11

statute that precludes attachment of social security benefits

12

bars a state's attempt to attach those benefits in order to

13

reimburse itself for providing care and maintaining a prisoner

14

in custody.

15

Mr. Bennett, Petitioner, believes that pursuant to

16

the Supremacy Clause in Article VI, Clause II of the

17

Constitution, the federal statute prevails.

18

Bennett urges this Court to reverse the decision of the

19

Arkansas Supreme Court to the contrary.

20

To that end, Mr.

The factual matter is that Mr. Bennett is a sixty-

21

nine-year old social security pensioner.

He received

22

retirement benefits because he worked sufficient quarters to be

23

eligible for those benefits.

24

one years in the Arkansas Department of Correction on a

25

conviction in murder in the second degree.
3

He was serving a term of twenty-

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

While he was in the Department of Correction, he

1

2

began drawing these benefits at approximately the rate of $282

3

per month.

4

In 1981, the State of Arkansas passed a state

5

reimbursement statute which is Act 715.

6

effective in June of 1981.

7

suit against Mr. Bennett and two other Petitioners asking that

8

they be forced to reimburse the state for their cost of care.

9

The Act became

In January of 1983, the state filed

In April of 1983, the Congress passed a statute that

10

cut off benefits to prisoners entirely.

11

there was a consolidated answer by the parties.

12

filed in 1984.

13

being decided but after the Court had entered an order seizing

14

these funds, Mr. Bennett was released from incarceration. A

15

judgment came down in 1985 and then the judgement ordered that

16

the monies continued to be held pending outcome of any

17

litigation.

18

In November of '83,
Briefs were

In December of 1984, prior to the case finally

Specifically raised in the trial court was the

19

question of whether under the Supremacy Clause, the federal

20

exemption statute for social security benefits preempted the

21

state reimbursement statute.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Carpenter, now, is there any money at

23

issue here that would be governed by the passage of the 1983

24

amendments?

25

MR. CARPENTER:

Yes, Your Honor.
4

There is

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

approximately some place between $10 and $1800 pre-1983 and

2

there is approximately an equal amount after the 1983 statutes.

3

However, Mr. Bennett's monies were treated as an

4

over-payment by the Social Security Department. Those monies

5

have been returned to the Social Security through withholding

6

of his future payments which began again upon his release in

7

December of 1984.

8
9

QUESTION:

So, if you prevail, he will get reimbursed

eventually, is that what would happen?

10

MR. CARPENTER:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. CARPENTER:

Yes, Your Honor.

He will.

And is Petitioner Shelton a party now?
No, Your Honor.

Petitioner Shelton

13

would never complete an affidavit of indigence during the

14

course of litigation.

15

with him afterwards.

16

QUESTION:

He was released and I lost all contact

So, he's not before us at all, and all we

17

have is the case involving reimbursement to a prisoner with

18

social security benefits, is that right?

19
20
21

22
23

MR. CARPENTER:

Yes, Your Honor.

That's the issue

before the Court today.
QUESTION:

I guess I still don't understand.

Will he

get money or are you challenging the post-1983 money as well?
MR. CARPENTER:

I am at this time, Your Honor, for

24

this reason:

the money collected from May 1983 until his

25

release in December of 1984 were social security benefits.
5
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

He was ineligible for them, but rather than treat

2

them in any other way, Social Security treated it merely as an

3

over-payment. When he became eligible again for social security

4

payments in January of 1985, after his release, the Social

5

Security Department attached his future payments.

6

So, all of the monies being held now really are

7

social security monies that Mr. Bennett should have received

8

personally at one time or another.

9

QUESTION:

Well, post-May '83, he shouldn't have

10

received it, and it seems to me your complaint is that the

11

state should not have taken them. I mean, --

12

MR. CARPENTER:

13

QUESTION:

That's right.

And, therefore, there should be no over­

14

payment charged against his future payments.

15

saying the state should return the over-payment rather than his

16

returning the over-payment.

17

MR. CARPENTER:

18

QUESTION:

Right?

You're

That's right.

But you're not saying he was entitled to

19

any money after 1983, you're just saying he shouldn't be

20

charged after he was released for payments which he never

21

received post-1983.

22

MR. CARPENTER:

Your Honor, I'm not sure that I've

23

made myself clear.

24

'83 to December of '84, because Social Security did not cut

25

them off like they should have.

He continued to receive payments from May

6

Heritage Reporting Corporation

628-4888

1

QUESTION:

Right.

2

MR. CARPENTER:

That was treated as an over-payment

3

from Social Security to Mr. Bennett.

4

again for benefits when he was released. Social Security

5

recouped this over-payment from him by deducting the money from

6

future payments.

7

Mr. Bennett was eligible

I do not contend that the money should go from the

8

prison to Social Security.

9

go from the prison to Mr. Bennett because they are his monies

10

I contend upon release they should

now.
QUESTION:

11

What should go to him is not the money

12

between May of '83 and the time he was released.

13

what should go to him.

14

money that should have gone to him after his release.

15

saying there shouldn't have been any charges against that

16

money.

17

between May of '83 and the time he was released. You do not

18

claim he was entitled to any money then, do you?

19
20

That's not

What you're really asking for is the

Your Honor.

22

QUESTION:

What will happen if monetarily, if this

23

Court reverses the judgment of the Supreme Court of Arkansas,

24

what will Mr. Bennett get?

25

MR. CARPENTER:

He will get $3,600 which is currently

(202) 628-4888

1

being held, and under the judgment, he will get the interest

2

that's been accruing on that money since the date of the

3

judgment.

4

QUESTION:

And if we affirm the judgment of the

5

Supreme Court by Arkansas, the State of Arkansas will get that

6

$3,600?

7

MR. CARPENTER:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. CARPENTER:

Plus the interest.

Okay.
The Supremacy Clause is called into

10

question in this particular case because there's a clear

11

conflict in the text of the state reimbursement statute with

12

the federal pre-emption statute.

13

The federal pre-emption statute holds that the

14

entitlement to payments at present or in the future are not

15

subject to levy, attachment, garnishment or other legal

16

process.

17

defines the estate of a prisoner to include social security

18

benefits.

19

Yet, the state reimbursement statute expressly

Now, when you have a direct conflict between a

20

federal statute and a state statute, as is present in this

21

case, this Court has consistently held that the federal statute

22

must fall under the Supremacy Clause argument.

23

The Arkansas Supreme Court has never recognized or

24

has never articulated the fact that there is a direct conflict

25

between the state statute and the federal statute.
8

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

Instead,

1

the Arkansas Supreme Court suggested that it could ignore the

2

plain textual conflict and move into a determination as to

3

whether the purpose of the federal statute met the purpose of

4

the state statute.

5

It's our contention, first, that that was an

6

inappropriate thing to do and that the case should have stopped

7

at the recognition of the clear conflict in the language.

8

However, even if we go to the second step and get into the

9

purpose of the particular statutes, it's clear that the

10
11

Arkansas Supreme Court did not correctly decide this issue.
The purpose of social security statutes is to provide

12

benefits to beneficiaries who have qualified for them.

13

retirement sense, it is effectively an annuity-type contract.

14

You make forced payments from your payroll and in exchange, you

15

are guaranteed payments at the end.

16

In the

But Congress recognized at the time that it passed

17

this that it had the right to take these benefits away

18

entirely. It could at any moment with the stroke of a pen say

19

social security is no longer available to the citizens of the

20

United States, and partly for that reason, as this Court

21

recognized in Hisquierdo, in a different type of benefit but

22

same type of statute, the vulnerability of these particular

23

benefits is such that the Court is unwilling to let these

24

benefits or the Congress is unwilling to let these benefits be

25

subject to attachment by any type of creditor.
9

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

That's an important point here because it raises, I

1

2

think, the mis-rationale of the Supreme Court of Arkansas.

The

3

purpose of social security is to provide for the benefit, the

4

care and benefit and maintenance of the individual, but the

5

purpose of the exemption statute is to assure that these

6

benefits are not subjected to creditors, and that purpose is in

7

conflict with the reimbursement statute that the state has

8

passed because the state is merely a creditor trying to be

9

repaid for providing care and maintenance to these individuals.
The cost of care is defined as food, clothing,

10
11

medical care and normal living expenses.

12

reimbursement statute goes further.

13

to include other things because it discusses it in terms of per

14

capita basis later on in the statute, which can mean the cost

15

of providing guards, which is not a social security purpose.

16

However, the

It permits costs of care

It also provides in the statute that if there is some

17

sort of contempt citation involved, then the cost of that can

18

be taken from these monies, which is not a social security

19

purpose.

20

It also provides that the cost of investigation to

21

find out if the individual has these funds in the first place

22

is the type of cost that can be reimbursed, and that is not a

23

social security purpose.

24

The key to the matter is that neither on the face of

25

the language or the purpose behind the particular statutes are
10

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

.

1

the Arkansas statutes and the federal exemption statutes

2

reconcilable.

Now, the reason we have our form of government is

3
4

because we had to recognize at some point the Federal

5

Government must prevail, and for that reason, we have a

6

Supremacy Clause in our Constitution, and this is a prime

7

example as to why the statute in Arkansas must fall to the

8

extent that it permits attachment of these federal benefits.
We would like to conclude with this short note.

9

/

They are in clear conflict.

If

10

the case is reversed, this is merely another case in a long

11

line of cases on Supremacy Clause litigation, and at most would

12

be a case note in our constitutional law textbooks.

13

case is affirmed, it becomes a dagger with which to shred the

14

fabric that has protected the federal-state relationship since

15

our country was founded 200 years ago, and then it becomes a

16

chapter in our common law textbooks and a very dangerous step

17

towards ruining federalism.

MR. LAZARUS:

What Arkansas seeks to accomplish here is the very

1

2

thing barred by Section 207 of the Social Security Act.

3

attachment and seizure of social security benefits.

4

textual conflict in our view is head-on.

5

in either the federal or the state law.

The

The

There is no ambiguity

Section 207 provides that social security benefits

6

7

shall not be subject to attachment or other legal process, but

8

that is precisely what Arkansas sought in its complaint, what

9

was ordered by the trial court, and what was held to be

10

permissible by the Arkansas Supreme Court.
Contrary to Arkansas' claim, Section 207 contains no

11

12

implied exemption for a state that is seeking reimbursement for

13

costs it incurred in providing for another individual's basic

14

needs.

15

County Welfare Board settled that issue.

This Court's decision, we believe, in Philpott v. Essex

The Court concluded there that it saw "no reason why

16
17

a state performing its statutory duty to take care of the needy

18

should be in a preferred position as compared to any other

19

creditor."

20

The Court expressly or necessarily rejected

21

practically all the limiting principles upon which Respondent

22

relies in this case.

reason to place the state outside the scope of the anti­

10

The only difference between the two cases is

There is no more

Indeed, the state's claim in Philpott to a certain

11

extent was arguably stronger than this case because there,

12

unlike here, the individual expressly agreed in advance to

13

reimburse the state and at the state's behest had applied for

14

social security benefits presumably to that end.

15

Respondent in certain lower courts suggests one other

16

possible ground for distinction.

17

does not apply to claims against the individual's estate when

18

the claimant has legal custody of the individual.

19

statutory language, however, makes no such distinction.

20

does not deprive one of legal custody of its federal right

21

under Section 207 to control the disbursement of a social

22

security benefit.

It

We do not deny that certain equities favor the

24

state's position in this case.

Section 207, however, does not

25

call for or allow for a balancing of the equities.
13

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

To the

1

extent that any inequity exists, an application of 207, only

2

Congress can revisit the issue.

V

In fact, Congress has done so to a limited extent,

3
4

but Congress did not choose Arkansas' preferred solution.

5

Congress determined instead that to the extent that an inequity

6

is presented, when the individual is in a penal institution,

7

the correct answer is that the Federal Government and not the

8

states will get the money.

9

Congress did not lift the anti-assignment bar.

10

Congress, instead, concluded that incarcerated felons should

11

not receive their social security benefits in the first

12

instance.
Finally, this Court's decision last term in Rose v.

13
14

Rose does not suggest otherwise.

15

involves a preemption challenge to state family law, did not

16

purport to question at all the Court's decision in Philpott.

17

The Court simply concluded that a similarly-worded anti-

18

attachment provision regarding veterans' disability benefits

19

was not implicated by a claim for child support because

20

Congress had intended that the children of veterans, too,

21

should receive those benefits.

22

Rose, unlike this case,

There is no comparable expression of congressional

23

intent that state penal institutions should receive the federal

monies.

therefore, are not comparable to the claims of the children

Congress could have made an exception for state

8

institutional care. Policy distinctions, we agree, do exist.

9

In other contexts, Congress has chosen to make specific

10

exceptions to the anti-assignment provision for this reason.

11

But Congress has not done so here.

12

In our view, that is simply the end of the matter.

13

One other final point.

In answer to a question posed

14

by Justice O'Connor and Justice Scalia, with respect to the

15

over-payment made here, it is the Government's view that Mr.

16

Bennett is currently entitled to money in the bank account.

17

After he was released from prison in December '84,

18

HHS discovered in January '85 that he had wrongly received

19

benefits while in prison.

20

prospectively for payments he was then entitled to for

21

retirement benefits up until,

22

HHS proceeded to recoup payments

I think, June of 1986.

At that time, HHS concluded that he had paid back

23

everything that he had been over-paid.

HHS subsequently

24

concluded in July of '86, about a year later, in June of '85,

25

that he had not yet paid back all that he had been over-paid
15

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

before.

2

proceeded to recoup again.

3

HHS notified Mr. Bennett in September of '86 and

In October of '86, after receiving a protest and a

4

request for a waiver from Mr. Bennett, under Section 404(b) of

5

the Social Security Act, a waiver of over-payment, HHS decided

6

to waive recoupment of the rest of the over-payment.

7

If there are no further questions.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

9

We'll hear now from you, General Clark.

Thank you, Mr. Lazarus.

10

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. STEVEN CLARK, ESQ.

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. CLARK:

12

13
14

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I submit to this Court that this case is a rather

15

simple one in the sense that the Congress in enacting the

16

Social Security Administration Act with retirement benefits

17

said that its purpose was to provide for the food, clothing and

18

necessary shelter for people who were approaching advancing age

19

and not to have them experience the rigors of poverty.

20

The Arkansas statute adopted in 1981 really in a very

21

direct respect had that same purpose.

22

logical purpose and goal for our state that was to see that

23

felons, those guilty of felonious conduct, could not get

24

windfall benefits by virtue of the fact that while they were

25

being taken care of, their total care and maintenance being
16

It was furtherance of a

1

provided by the state, that, in fact, while that occurred, that

2

they should not receive any windfall benefits and that those

3

benefits should be applied in the nature and form of a

4

reimbursement if, in fact, what Arkansas was doing was what the

5

Congress intended to have done with those retirement benefits.

V

I submit to you that's what happened in this case

6
7

with Petitioner Bennett.

Petitioner Bennett, as you have been

8

told, committed second degree murder and was sentenced to

9

twenty-one years in our institution.
In 1982, he turned sixty-two.

10

He voluntarily and

11

without any compulsion from our state applied for retirement

12

benefits.

13

thought was a bad public policy of committing such windfalls.

14

In 1983, Arkansas acting as, I submit to you, the state has the

15

power to act, decided to try to recoup from Petitioner Bennett

16

$4,000 that he had in terms of assets in contrast to some

17

$27,000 that we had spent for his cost of incarceration.

We adopted a statute in 1981 recognizing what we

*

18

Our statute specifically says this:

reimbursement

19

costs for food, clothing, shelter, medical and normal living

20

expenses to the per capita amount that is to have been expended

21

on that person incarcerated in just a correctional facility.

22

It does not permit us to collect above that amount.

23

instance of Petitioner Bennett, had he left our institution

24

with $35,000 and we had been able to collect $27,000, he would

25

have had an $8,000 check presented to him at the time of his
17
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

In the

J

1

departure.
It goes to exactly the amount that we, in fact,

2

3

expend as a per capita cost, which I submit to this Court is

4

consistent with what the Congress came back around to do in

5

1983. When the Congress said in its amendments to the Social

6

Security Act as to retirement benefits, that, in fact, that is

7

a windfall, and that windfall should not occur.

8

9

Since that time, as you know, the Congress has made
sure that those benefits do not flow. In the instance of

10

Petitioner Bennett, there was a mistake made by the Social

Security Administration and by the State of Arkansas.

12

ready here to tell this Court we will rectify that mistake if

13

there has been any over-payment collected by us to which we owe

14

the Social Security Administration.

In fact, until these briefs were filed with the

16

Court, we simply were not aware of that.

17

state was not, but we stand ready to say that if there's been

18

an over-payment and we've gotten a windfall benefit, it's our

19

responsibility then to make the Social Security Administration

20

whole.

21

QUESTION:

I should tell you the

And since the 1983 amendments, you concede

22

that the state can't get any recoupment or take any portion of

23

the benefits?

24
25

MR. CLARK:

For retirement benefits, yes, Your Honor.

I concede we cannot recoup from social security retirement

benefits. In fact, there is a department memo that says any

2

social security retirement checks that are received by the

department are to be returned to the Social Security

Administration.
We only have forty-five inmates in our system, Your

Honor, who are over the age of sixty-two at this point.

7

system.
QUESTION:

I'm glad to hear what you've just said,

10

General Clark, because I couldn't see why this amount should be

11

in dispute at all.
MR. CLARK:

12
13
14

It seems to me pretty cut and dried.
Your Honor, I think it is very cut and

dry.
QUESTION:

Now, as to the rest of it, suppose I

15

provide -- suppose my elderly parents live with me and I

16

provide all their food and lodging, would I be able to obtain

17

their — a right to their social security payments?

MR. CLARK:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. CLARK:

No, Your Honor, I think not.
And why is that?
I think the difference in the

21

hypothetical you have offered and what we have in this case is

22

that you've done that by a matter of choice.

23

statutory scheme, we have an obligation to provide that food,

24

care, shelter and normal living expenses and medical expenses

25

to an inmate in our system.

On the Arkansas

mandatory statutory scheme, we have a constitutional

responsibility.

4

have repeatedly told us in a lot of litigation, some of which

5

has come to this Court, called Huddell v. Finney, what that

6

responsibility is constitutionally under the Eighth Amendment,

7

the Fourteenth Amendment, and how it's applied in terms of that

8

total care and maintenance.

9

*

But even if we chose as state policy to repeal that

The District Courts of these United States

So, I think you can distinguish and there's a

10

distinction in the hypothetical in the sense that in yours,

11

Your Honor, you have voluntarily accepted that responsibility.

12

In ours, it is an obligation that's constitutionally mandated

13

which we must live up to.

14

QUESTION:

Suppose I have obligations under state law

15

to support my spouse and my wife becomes old and unable to take

16

care of herself and I fulfill that obligation, provide her

17

room, lodging, food and everything, am I then entitled to get

18

the social security payment because I have an obligation to

19

support her?

20

MR. CLARK:

No, Your Honor, I think not.

I think

21

again the distinction in this case is that in the instance of

22

Petitioner Bennett, when he voluntarily committed a criminal

23

act and became a part of our system, we had a constitutional

24

responsibility.

25

what we did was fulfill the intent of Congress in a very narrow

2

were only two cases of social security retirement benefits

3

which the state attempted to attach in that period of time, and

4

only in the instance of a person incarcerated in a penal

5

facility in my state.

6

The statute does not go beyond that.

7

QUESTION:

Really, all you have shown so far, it

8

seems to me, General Clark, is that perhaps if Congress had

9

thought about this, it would have said that Arkansas' situation

10

would be an exception to the anti-assignment statute, but

11

you've got the flat language of the anti-assignment statute.

In fact, there

MR. CLARK:

I think, Your Honor, when you look at the

13

plain language, you have to look at the test that I think is

specifically identified in the Solicitor General's brief, which

says that you look at — that our case is not barred.

at the language and the purpose to formulate the intent.

suffer that burden if, in fact, they fulfill what was in this

5

small window of time the intent of Congress in providing for

these total care and maintenance of these inmates.

*

This policy adopted by Arkansas was consistent with

8

the later amendments.

You might say to some degree, we're just

9

twenty-four months ahead of our time, that Congress came back

10

and said you're right, this is a windfall and it's wrong.

in this small window, the --

12

QUESTION:

So,

Congress also said you're wrong in

13

thinking you get it, we get it.

14

MR. CLARK:

Yes, that's correct, Your Honor.

That is

15

correct, and the Congress said that's our and they did say the

16

state should not receive it, that that should stay in the

17

social security trust fund.

18

I admit that readily.

But what I would also say to you is that the Congress

19

didn't prohibit that prior to the '83 amendments.

When they

20

came back in '83, they got very specific.

21

retirement benefits flow, no longer.

22

only flow if, in fact, the person who has received a disability

at this case, that the Petitioner would have you believe that

2

it should be disposed of very easily by just looking at that

plain language and that really isn't a case at bar here today,

4

and, yet, I submit that's not correct.

5

this Court articulated in Rose v. Rose.

That's really not the

test that the SG brief even says it is.

It says, and I quote,

"it's equally clear the validity of a challenged state law

(2) its purpose.

That's not the test

10

The Arkansas state statute from 1981 to 1983 did not

frustrate congressional purpose, and as in the case of Rose v.

12

Rose, if you just stop and say, levy attached on so forth, we

13

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. CARPENTER, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

9

MR. CARPENTER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I don't know how General Clark can say he imposes no

10

11

hardship. George Bennett is a sixty-nine year old man that

12

can't get a job and had to leave the Department of Corrections

13

without the $1800 which would have been a great benefit to him

14

in providing for his care and maintenance when he left, and had

15

he not had family members to go and live with at that

16

particular time, he would have been destitute.

17

So, I think it does pose a hardship.

The fact that

18

the State of Arkansas doesn't at this time seem to attach

19

social security and has some memorandum out is no future

20

guarantee that it's not going to make the effort again, and

21

it's important for this Court to rule that that effort cannot

22

be made.

23

The Respondent is suggesting essentially that there

24

should be a new type of exemption under 42 USC 407 or Section

25

207 of the Code and this is for those that are constitutionally

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

mandated to provide for care, yet the Congress has never said

2

that those that are constitutionally mandated to provide care

3

to individuals are exempt from our attachment statutes, and

4

Congress certainly has the ability to do that.

5

✓

6

other types of retirement benefits as to whether people that

7

committed certain types of crimes, mostly treason-type crimes,

8

are entitled to these benefits anyway, Congress very quickly

9

said no.

When Congress was given opportunities to deal with

10

different situations, they set up guidelines.

12

so and then it directed the Secretary through the regulations

13

to do so and the Secretary did that.

14

Everything we've heard from the state is essentially

15

a policy argument. The state is trying to say our policy meets

16

your policy and, therefore, it's a good policy.

relative importance of a state's own suggestion or own law is

18

not material and this Court has so held when it conflicts with

a federal law.
