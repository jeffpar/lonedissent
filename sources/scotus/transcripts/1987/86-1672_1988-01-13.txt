The opinion of the Court in

MR. HOROWITZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case concerns the two-tiered
structure established by Congress to govern the tax treatment
of a corporation and its shareholders.

To briefly summarize

14

that structure,

15

entity that must recognize on its own return the tax

16

consequences of its business activities.

17

individual taxes are affected by this business activity only

18

indirectly, that is, in connection with their own dealings with

19

the corporate entity.

20

it treats a corporation as a separate taxable

The shareholders’

Corporate income is recognized by the corporation.

21

The shareholders pay tax on corporate income only when they

22

receive a distribution of corporate earnings, either as

23

dividends or liquidating distributions.

24
25

Similarly, when a corporation suffers net operating
losses in a given year, that loss is deductible by the
corporation on its own return and may be carried back to

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

earlier years or carried forward for up to 15 years to be

£

offset against corporate income in future years.

3

would be reflected on the shareholders’ return, only if they

4

dispose of their interest in the corporation or liquidate it.

5

Such a loss

Back in the 1940s, this Court in the Mo1ine case,

6

considered the question whether this two-tiered tax structure

7

applied in full to so-called dummy corporat ions.

8

situations where a closely-held corporat ion’s interest are

9

essentially congruent with those of its shareholders or perhaps

That is,

10

in many cases a sole shareholder, and where the business

11

activity of the corporation is quite limited.

1£

The facts of the Moline case are in many respects

13

quite similar to those of the instant case.

14

Court held that the separate entity doctrine was fully

15

applicable to the facts there.

16

required an individual borrower to set up a corporation to hold

17

title to mortgaged property.

18

other business activity, and its expenses were paid directly by

19

the individual shareholder.

owner of the property, the Court held that the corporation had

undisclosed convenience, so long as that purpose is the

s

equivalent of business activity or is followed by the carrying

3

on of business by the corporation, the corporation remains a

4

separate taxable entity.”

5

The Court went on to say that once the taxpayer had

6

chosen the corporate form for his own business purposes, he was

7

bound by the tax consequences of this choice.

QUESTION:

There the corporation held the title to

the property in its own name, the dummy corporation, didn’t it?

10

MR. HOROWITZ:

11

QUESTION:

That’s right.

So what this Court said was that the Code

IS

simply required the taxpayer to recognize the record state of

13

affairs.

14

MR. HOROWITZ:

That’s right.

The corporation was the

15

owner of the property and the fact that it really didn’t do

16

anything other than operate for the individual shareholder

17

didn’t mean that that could just be transferred to the

18

individual shareholder.

19

had to be recognized by the corporation and a corporate tax

respondents do not directly challenge, although, as I’ll

explain later, we think the thrust of their argument here would
seriously undermine the Moline principle.

We believe that this case is governed by the rule of

exceptions sooken of in dicta in National Carbide for a true

9

MR. HOROWITZ;

We do.

We do recognize that

10

exception.

There’s no question that two parties can deal with

11

one another as an agent and a principal,

12

actions of the agent are imputed to the principal and the

Right.
Yes, we have no quarrel with those.

We obviously quarrel with respondents over what the proper
interpretat ion of those factors are.

We do think that that,

in

22

the case of a controlled corporation, that was intended to be a

23

fairlv narrow exception bv the National Carbide Court, which I

MR. HOROWITZ:

QUESTION:

MR. HOROWITZ:

In this case?

Yes.
I don’t think the corporation reported

any income in this case.

Now, basically the partners treated

the corporation as a non-existent shell.

Now, they say in

their brief that thev concede that under Moline it was a

separate taxable entity, and all they are quibbling about is

relationship?

In order for it to be a true agent

Well, we think where there’s a controlled

corporation situation, we think there is a pretty heavy burden

Heritage

7
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

t

to be borne by the taxpayer in showing that there’s actually a
2

true agency.

3

we think this was set forth in the National Carbide case,

4

that the relations between a principal and his agent and the

5

kind of control that a principal exerts over his agent is quite

6

similar to the kind of control that a sole shareholder would

7

exert over a closely held corporation, just in the exercise of

8

the normal shareholder-corporation relationship.

9

»

The problem that requires this heavy burden, and
is

So it’s kind of an easy expedient for avoiding the

10

Moline rule to sav. well, we’ve oot this corooration. we set it

11

up, we’re controlling it, but we’re not controlling it as

12

shareholders, we’re controlling it as agents, and we’re going
to write up a little agreement and call it an agency agreement.

13
14

That’s what the taxoaver tried to do in National Carbide and

15

the Court rejected that.

16

Now,

if you use an unrelated agent, then the

17

situation is a lot clearer because there is no other basis for

18

the control that the principal is exerting over the agent, so

19

it’s easy enough for the Court or for the Service to credit the

20

agency agreement.

21

QUESTION:

Nell, the income here was received by a

22

partnership, wasn’t it?

23

It was received by Creekside as CNA, whatever that is?

24
25

MR. HOROWITZ:

It wasn’t received by the corporation.

Well, what happened was the

corporation went out and it got a loan from the bank in its own
name, didn’t purport to be acting as an agent or anything like

QUESTION:

12

MR. HOROWITZ:

So it wasn’t a corporate account?
It was not labeled as a corporate

account, but the property was owned by the corporation and the

1A

corporation was the obligor on the loan.

15

Government’s position is that although they called it an

1&

individual account, they’re basically skipping a step.

17

that money all rebounded to the corporation.

action that’s not directed by its officers.

MR. HOROWITZ:

No, there’s no dispute that the

corporation was the obligor on the loan.

that the principal obligor on the loan was the corporation.
QUESTION:

10

11

I mean even respondents concede in their brief

Properties case?

Was there a guarantee in the Moline

I can’t tell from the opinion.

MR. HOROWITZ:

12

Well, in the Moline Properties case

13

originally the loan was taken out directly by the individual,

14

and then the bank asked them to set up this corporation and so

15

the corporation then assumed the liability, assumed the

16

mortgage.

17

QUESTION:

Do you know from the opinion whether the

18

individual, after the assumption by the corporation, remained

19

liable on the note in the Moline case?

20

MR. HOROWITZ:

I don’t know whether there was a

21

personal guarantee that was reflected in writing, but the

22

Moline case is clear that the corporation had no bank accounts

23

and had no money in its own name, so it’s clear enough that the

24

individual was paying the loan and that the lender was looking

25

to the individual for the payment of the loan.

find therefore we think the fact that these kind

of partnerships always use a controlled corporation and the
facts in this case and the facts in the Frink case that’s also
pending before this Court, both reflect that the partnerships

they could use a controlled corporation.
They reflect that there’s more going on than just an

MR. HEMBREE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I should like to use my time this morning to
concentrate on four areas.

That is, the attempt to clarify

by the Sixth Circuit, there is no question but what the income

The Kentucky

usury law was changed in 197£ which was right in the middle of

this period, and I think that indicated that the Kentucky law,
as most of the laws in various states involving usury became

14

antiquated because of the high rate of increase in the interest

rates, and as soon as the legislature could get around to it,

16

it did correct the problem that existed at that time.

Mr. Bollinger.

that there should be some kind of a constructive ownership

Now, the Government makes a comported argument

I’d like to just mention briefly some of the

very what I consider to be crucial facts that were found by the

Tax Court and accepted by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth

11

partnerships were the owners of the apartment complexes, and

12

they remained the real and true direct owners upon the transfer

13

of the bare legal title to the nominee corporat ions.

14

QUESTION:

How do you distinguish Moline?

MR. HEMBREE:

I don’t distinguish Moline. Your Honor.

I say that Moline supports us because Moline Properties is a
case which the issue to start with in that case was, who is the
taxpayer, and the Board of Tax Appeals held that the taxpayer
was the sole shareholder and the basis for that holding was
that you ignored the separate entity.
QUESTION:

Yes, but the Board got reversed.

MR. HEMBREE:

And a very important aspect of that and

this gets over to a point that was brought up by Mr. Horowitz.

And of course, the Government in that case

was on your side.

Of course, that solves the whole case.

11

MR. HEMBREE:

Well, Justice Stevens,

I believe there

12

are two aspects over the Moline Prooerties case, number one and

13

the principal part of it was that the sole shareholder was

14

attempting to say I am the sole shareholder and I have the

15

complete beneficial interest of everything the corporation has.

16

Therefore, we should be treated as one, and the fact that there

has been a sale of property by the corporation on which there

was a gain, there shouldn’t be a separate tax,

19

taxed to me directly.

out, that there was no agency agreement or any other

had.

So there is I think why the Moline Pro pert v case is not

the principle that was established there,

I think, was an

Can I do that from year to year, and that’s all it

MR. HEMBREE:

No, Your Honor, not in terms of

shifting the income of the type that we’re talking about here.
Because if you can each year surely you could as a sole
shareholder, enter into a new agreement with the cooperation
and once you enter into that agreement, then it depends on what

Petitioner also states that the Sixth Circuit
concluded that even if the corporations were viable separate
entities, their income and expenses could be attributed
directly to Bollinger and his partners under the agency theory.
That was not the holding of the Sixth Circuit at all.

The

holding of the Sixth Circuit was that the proprietorships and
the partnerships conducted the business of constructing and
operating the apartments in the partnership and proprietorship
forms, and not in the corporate form, and that the income
realized was attributable to the efforts and assets of the
proprietorships and the partnership.
Thus,

I think it is completely erroneous and

misleading for the petitioner to say in his brief that the
income and expenses were considered by the Sixth Circuit to be
those of the corporation and that it attributed the
corporat ion’s earnings to the partnerships and proprietorships.
One other thing which I briefly mentioned before, but
this gets to the very heart of it, at page 2 of his reply
brief, the petitioner states that respondents note, at page

of

the brief, that "corporate ownership of properties was
specified by the lenders as a prerequisite of making the
loans.”

This is a complete misstatement of what was said in

respondents’ brief.

The statement in the respondent’s brief

referred only to nominal debtor and that the nominal debtor be
a corporate nominee of the partnerships and that record title
to the property be held by the corporate nominee.
