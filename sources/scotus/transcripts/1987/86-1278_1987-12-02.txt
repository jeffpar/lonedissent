(10:01 a.m.)
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

3

We'll hear argument first

this morning in No. 86-1278, Hustler Magazine and Larry C.

Flynt versus Jerry Falwell.
Mr. Isaacman, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN L. ISAACMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. ISAACMAN:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The First Amendment protects all speech except for

11
12

certain narrowly drawn categories.

13

Amendment does protect false statements of fact made with

14

requisite fault.

15

speech.

16

made in the presence of the person to whom the words are

17

addressed and likely to incite violence.

18

For example, the First

The First Amendment doesn't protect obscene

The First Amendment doesn't protect fighting words

This cases raises as a general question the question

19

of whether the Court should expand the areas left unprotected

20

by the First Amendment, and create another exception to

21

protected speech. And in this situation, the new area that is

22

sought to be protected is satiric or critical commentary of a

23

public figure which does not contain any assertions of fact.

24
25

QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that would be a change

in our constitutional jurisprudence to protect that?

MR.

ISAACMAN:

Yes, sir,

I ara.

I am suggesting

that.
In a specific way, the guestion becomes: is

3
4

rhetorical hyperbole, satire, parody, or opinion protected by

5

the First Amendment when it doesn't contain assertions of fact

6

and when the subject of the rhetorical hyperbole is a public

7

figure.

8

Amendment limitations which have been set out in New York Times

9

versus Sullivan and its progeny be evaded by a public figure

Another way of putting this case is, can the First

10

who instead of alleging libel or instead of alleging invasion

11

of privacy, seeks recovery for an allegedly injurious falsehood

12

by labeling his cause of action intentional infliction of

13

emotional distress.

14

In judging the publication that's at issue here,

I

15

think it's important to look at the context in which it

16

appeared.

17

Hustler Magazine is known by its readers as a magazine that

18

contains sexually explicit pictures, and contains irreverent

19

humor.

20

the sanctimonious in our society.

21

areas primarily.

22

it focuses on religion.

23

The speaker of course was Hustler Magazine, and

As an editorial policy, it takes on the sacred cows and
It focuses on three subject

It focuses on sex,

it focuses on politics and

Hustler Magazine has been the target of attacks and

24

critical commentary by Jerry Falwell for years and for years

25

prior to this ad publication.

Heritage

Hustler Magazine is at the other

end of the political spectrum from Jerry Falwell.

On the other

2

hand, Jerry Falwell filling out the context of this speech, is

3

the quintessential public figure.

4

person in this country who doesn't hold political office who

5

can has more publicity associated with his name than Jerry

6

Falwell.

It's hard to imagine a

Jerry Falwell is the head of the moral majority.

7

8

The moral majority, he testified at the trial, numbers some six

9

million people.

It's a political organization, he indicates.

10

It was set up to advance certain political views.

One of the

11

foremost views is to attack what he considers to be

12

pornography, and to attack kings of porn, in his words.

13

foremost among those kings of porn in his mind is Larry Flynt.

14

He includes in that group others as well, such as Bob Guccioni

15

of Penthouse and such as Hugh Hefner of Playboy.

And

The moral majority and Jerry Falwell also attack

sexual conduct that they don't consider appropriate.

24
25

He has

He also doesn't approve and condemns homosexuality.

These are views that he's gone on the

He has been known in his words, as he testified, by
the Good Housekeeping magazine which did a survey as the

Reporting

(202) 628-4888

6
1

second-most admired man in the United States, next to the

2

President.
QUESTION:

3
4

Well, Mr. Isaacman, is the fact that you

claim Mr. Falwell is a public figure in dispute in this case?

5

MR. ISAACMAN:

6

QUESTION:

It isn't in dispute at all.

Well, then, I guess we could move on to

7

the arguments, because apparently your remarks are for the

8

purpose of demonstrating he's a public figure.
MR. ISAACMAN:

9

Is that right?

Justice O'Connor, it's to really to

10

fill out the political context and the fact that what we have

11

here are people who are at opposite ends of the political

12

spectrum, engaging in the uninhibited robust and wide open

13

debate in New York Times v. Sullivan.
QUESTION:

14

Does the State have an interest in

15

protecting its citizens from emotional distress, do you

16

suppose?

17
18
19
20
21

MR. ISAACMAN:

Clearly, the State has an interest in

protecting its citizens from emotional distress.
QUESTION:

And perhaps that's an even greater

interest than protecting reputation.
MR. ISAACMAN:

I would submit that it is not a

22

greater interest than protecting reputation, because in the

23

area of reputational injury, libel as we know it, for example,

24

when it's in written form, emotional distress is an element of

25

recovery as well as damage to reputation, and reputation

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

7

1

affects what other people think of you.

2

on in the minds of other people as well, and not just the minds

3

of one citizen.

4

territory than emotional distress does.

5

It affects what goes

So reputation in a sense covers a lot more

And the point of what I'm trying to make is that we

6

really have people who are engaging in political debate in a

7

way that involves vehement caustic and sometimes unpleasantly

8

sharp language, as the New York Times v. Sullivan used.

9

Now, this speech is protected as rhetorical

10

hyperbole, it's protected as satire and parody and as the

11

expression of opinion.
QUESTION:

12
13

had found that the allegations could be considered factual?

14
15

16

Would this be a different case if the jury

MR. ISAACMAN:
case.

It certainly would be a different

It certainly would be a different case.
We think that even in that situation, this Court

17

should find that these allegations could in no way be perceived

18

as factual as a matter of law, and in exercising its obligation

19

under Bose, I think the Court would have to do an independent

20

review of the record to determine that constitutional fact,

21

that is to say, that there was no actual malice in this case

22

because this can't be perceived.

23

Just as in Letter Carriers v. Austin, calling the

24

plaintiffs there a traitor to their God, their country, their

25

family, saying they have a corkscrew soul, saying that instead

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

8
1

of a heart they have tortured principles, was considered by

2

this Court to be rhetorical hyperbole, and not to be taken

3

literally.
Similarly, there's nothing in this ad parody that can

4
5

be taken as a statement of fact.

6

situation where the jury has made that determination for us.

7

So we now know that even this jury, which should never have

8

been allowed to consider this.

9

QUESTION:

10

Well, do you think that finding by the

jury has opened for this Court to consider again de novo?
MR. ISAACMAN:

11

12

And we're in an unusual

No, we don't think it is.

We don't

think it is because -QUESTION:

13

I thought you were suggesting that in the

14

First Amendment context, we'd have to consider those issues

15

again.
MR. ISAACMAN:

16

Justice O'Connor, I suggest that in

17

the First Amendment context, when a determination is made by a

18

jury that's adverse to speech, and when a jury finds that the

19

speaker made statements that could be construed as statements

20

of fact and were knowingly false, then it is incumbent upon the

21

Court to take that review for the purpose of protecting the

22

speaker.

23

have to protect the speaker.

And that's what the First Amendment says, that you

24

QUESTION:

You think Bose is a one-way street, then?

25

MR. ISAACMAN:

Heritage

Your Honor, I do think it's a one-way

Reporting

(202) 628-4888

9
1

street.

Bose is intended to protect the speaker, it's not

2

intended to protect the emotionally distressed interest that

3

the State is seeking to protect in the area of intentional

4

infliction of emotional stress or in the area of libel.

5

not only that, but we have a situation where there hasn't been

6

an appeal from the determination in the jury, so that's res

7

judicata yet.

8
9
10

QUESTION:

And

This is all matter that isn't really

directly involved in your case.

I mean, you have a favorable

determination from the jury.

11

MR. ISAACMAN:

12

Now, going on, we not only have the example of Letter

13
14

Carriers, but we have the example of Greenbelt v. Bresler where
/
the plaintiff in that case was accused of being engaged in

15

blackmail.

16

literally because that was just intended to describe his

17

negotiating position, and that is hyperbole.

18

Yes, sir, that's correct.

And the Court said that that can't be taken

And we have ample lower court precedents on the

19

subject, such as the Pring case, which was a Penthouse article

20

about a Miss Wyoming which attributed certain sexual activities

21

on her part, and she sued for libel, intentional infliction of

22

emotional stress, and other causes of action.

23

Circuit, after an adverse jury determination to Penthouse, the

24

Tenth Circuit reversed and dismissed that case, saying that

25

that's rhetorical hyperbole.

Heritage

That article couldn't be

And the Tenth

10

1

perceived as describing actual facts about the plaintiff in

2

that case, or actual events in which she participated.

3

finding that the jury made in this case.

4

Same

And the Court then went on to say that since it's

5

rhetorical hyperbole and protected by the First Amendment

6

against a libel claim, it's also protected against an

7

intentional infliction of emotional distress claim which there

8

was called outrage under Wyoming law because the same

9

constitutional defenses apply.

10

And earlier this year in the First Circuit in the

11

L.L. Bean v. Drake Publishers, the Court there said that parody

12

is protected speech, and even though the plaintiff in that case

13

complained about the sexual parody that occurred of L.L. Bean's

14

Catalog, that was protected speech and the case was found in

15

favor of the speaker in that situation.

16

Beyond that, Jerry Falwell as a public figure should

17

not be permitted to evade the First Amendment limitations that

18

have been set forth in New York Times v. Sullivan, and many

19

many other cases with respect to his claim for an allegedly

20

injurious falsehood.

21

through Justice Mosc, determined in Blatty v. New York Times,

22

that where the gravamen of a complaint is allegedly injurious

23

falsehood, it doesn't matter what you call your claim, because

24

the First Amendment covers that area.

25

QUESTION:

The California Supreme Court recently,

Mr. Isaacman, what the New York Times rule

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

11
1

provides is not an absolute protection, but what a knowing

2

element, an element of specific intent to create a falsehood.

3

It doesn't give an absolute privilege to state falsehood.

4

just says the falsehood is okay unless there's an intent.
Now, here we have

5

It

a State Tort that is specifically

6

an intentional Tort.

There must be an intent

7

emotional distress, so it really is not quite the same category

8

of opening up that you're making it out to be.

9

issue is whether the

intent element is enough

to create the

11

major exception for purposes of this tort action.

12

right?

13

MR. ISAACMAN:

is also enough to make a
Isn't that

Justice Scalia, we have a lot of cases

14

including New York Times v. Sullivan, including Garrison v.

15

Louisiana, and say it's not the intent to cause harm. It's not

16

the hatred, it's not the ill will, it's not the spite that the

17

First Amendment is directed at.

18

through knowing falsehood or reckless falsehood.

19

Louisiana is a perfect example.

20

QUESTION:

It's intent to cause harm
Garrison v.

I understand you can draw the line there.

21

But all New York Times says is if you state falsehood with

22

knowledge of the falsehood intent to be false, the First

23

Amendment does prevent it.

24

that principle be extended to say you can cause emotional harm

25

to your heart's content, just as you can state falsity to your

Heritage

All I'm asking you is why can't

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

12

1

heart's content, but where you intend to create that emotional

2

harm, we have a different situation.

3

Isn't that a possible line?

4

MR. ISAACMAN:

I don't think that any reasonable

5

reader of any of the speech that has occurred in the cases

6

including New York Times v. Sullivan, Garrison and all the

7

other cases that have come down, Letter Carriers I gave as an

8

example, could ever say that the speaker did not intend to

9

cause harm.

10

When you say something that somebody has a corkscrew

11

soul and has tortured principles for a heart and is a traitor,

12

who can believe that person doesn't intend to cause harm.

13

People intend the natural consequences of their actions.

14

they intend when they say something critical, they intend that

15

that's going to cause some harm or some distress.

16

speech has to be protected, or all we're going to have is a

17

bland, milquetoast kind of speech in this country.
QUESTION:

18

That may well be.

And

And that

My only point is New

19

York Times, it seems to me, doesn't speak to it.

20

Times says intent is okay, is enough to get you out of it.

21

What you're saying is, this kind of intent shouldn't be enough,

22

intent to cause harm shouldn't be.
MR. ISAACMAN:

23
24
25

That's correct.

New York

Knowing falsity may

be enough.
QUESTION:

But even in the New York Times sense, if

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

13
1

what the asserted facts here were known to be untrue, I mean,

2

one who knew nothing about Mr. Falwell or anything about the

3

background could read this and think there might be some

4

individual that this was a factually correct statement about.

5

So that these are statements that were knowingly false, so they

6

really satisfied the New York Times standard in that sense.

7
8
9

MR. ISAACMAN:

Justice Stevens, the response to that

is really that there were no facts asserted.
QUESTION:

Well, I understand what your argument is,

10

but to the extent that there are factual statements, they

11

satisfy the New York Times standard because everybody knows

12

they're false, including the speaker.

13

MR. ISAACMAN:

If you change what this article means,

14

and you say this article's capable of being interpreted as an

15

assertion of fact, then you've kind of set the stage

16

differently from what it is, and from what the jury determined.

17

If you say that in Letter Carriers, that the person who made

18

that comment was really saying --

19

QUESTION:

Really, all I'm suggesting is pretty much

20

the same thing Justice Scalia is.

21

speaks to the problem we have before us in this case.

22

MR. ISAACMAN:

I'm not sure New York Times

It speaks in a sense that a knowing

23

falsity, a reckless falsity is required.

And that requires

24

that there be a false statement of fact.

And the cases

25

indicate that.

Letter Carriers

Garrison indicates that.

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

14
1

indicates that.

2

there has to be a false statement, and without a false

3

statement, there can be no false statement of fact.

4

Before there can be a false statement of fact,

QUESTION:

Well, that gets us back to Bose and

5

whether we have to reexamine this statement for ourselves to

6

determine whether it's a factual statement.

7

MR. ISAACMAN:

Well, that brings me back to my

8

response, Justice O'Connor, that if there were an adverse

9

determination to the speaker, this Court would have an

10

independent obligation to examine.

11

QUESTION:

I don't think Bose spelled it out that

12

way.

13

asking us to move on to another step beyond that case.

14

I don't read that necessarily into Bose.

MR. ISAACMAN:

So you may be

Well, the only thing I would say is

15

the only case I saw that dealt with that is Brown v. KNB

16

Corporation, a Connecticut Supreme Court case decided

17

August 18, 1987.

18

independent review goes one way and it goes to review the

19

adverse determination against the speaker.

20

review a finding that there was --

21

22

And my reading of that case is that the

QUESTION:

I suppose that Connecticut case isn't

binding on us.

23

MR. ISAACMAN:

24

QUESTION:

25

It doesn't go to

That's correct.

That's correct.

Well, even accepting what the jury found,

that there was no reputational injury here because there was no

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

15

1

believable fact asserted, for you to win, you have to say that

2

opinion or parody is never actionable, even though it's done

3

intentionally for the purpose of inflicting emotional distress.

4

That's your proposition, isn't it?

5

MR. ISAACMAN:

Well, Justice White, my proposition is

8

MR. ISAACMAN:

9

Isn't it, or not?

QUESTION:

11

MR. ISAACMAN:

3
4
5
6

As you stated, Your Honor,

no, it isn't.

10

12

No, no.

What is it, then?
Because what that leaves out is

opinion or parody that does not contain anything that can be
reasonably understood as a statement of fact.
QUESTION:

All right.

I agree with that, because

that's what the jury found.
MR. ISAACMAN:

The second thing that your

7

hypothetical left out, your proposition left out was that this

18

is a public figure who is bringing this action, somebody whdse

9

20

supposed to have a thick skin.
QUESTION:

All right.

Include that, and then you

21

say, parody or opinion about a public figure is never

22

actionable even though it's done intentionally for the purpose

23

of causing emotional distress, that's your proposition.

24
25

MR. ISAACMAN:

And even though it contains nothing

that can be understood as a false statement of fact.

Sure, sure.

MR. ISAACMAN:

Including that, I agree, yes.

That's

my proposition.

4

QUESTION:

That's your proposition.

5

MR. ISAACMAN:

You cross the line when you say

6

something that can be understood as a false statement of fact.

7

Otherwise, you're not going to have the uninhibited robust —
QUESTION:

8
9
10

that we must judge this case on the basis that there was no
fact involved.

You say the jury said there wasn't.

MR. ISAACMAN:

11
12

Well, I take it certainly it's arguable

The jury said there was nothing that

could be perceived, could be understood as a fact.
QUESTION:

13

If we judge the case on that basis, then

14

your proposition is there can't be any liability here at

15

all, --

16

MR. ISAACMAN:

17

QUESTION:

That's correct.

-- if there's a public figure involved.

18

Would you say if there wasn't a public figure involved, that we

19

could sustain this judgment?
Let's assume it was not a public figure.

20

No

21

believable or nothing that was said that could be interpreted

22

as a fact, and so there would be no libel, no reputational

23

injury.

24

say the judgment would stand, or not?

25

If there was not a public figure involved, you would

Fortunately, that's not my case.

But

17

I will answer that.

We don't have to deal with that case in

2

resolving this one.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. ISAACMAN:

Well, you haven't mentioned it, yet.
I would say that if it does not

5

contain a false statement of fact, or something that can be

6

perceived as a false statement of fact, then even it's a

7

private figure, it's protected speech.

9

QUESTION:

At common law, I suppose the exception was

just for fair comment, wasn't it?

MR. ISAACMAN:

11

QUESTION:

12

13

Common law in the?

In this tort of emotional distress, that

there was leeway for some kind of fair comment?
MR. ISAACMAN:

Well, this tort of emotional distress

14

is really such a new tort that there is, to my knowledge, not a

15

lot of decisions on point.

16

to evade your question and I'll try to answer it -- but in

17

Virginia, itself, we found no case that allows intentional

18

infliction of emotional distress cause of action in this arena,

19

and we pointed that out in our brief.

20

And in Virginia -- and I don't mean

And the only case we did find was this Mitchell v.

21

Dameron case, that indicated that you cannot sue for

22

intentional infliction of emotional stress when you're suing on

23

what is considered to be an allegedly injurious falsehood that

24

gives rise to a claimed libel action.

25

that tort duplicative and would give the opportunity for

Mr. Isaacman, you puzzled me with your

What is the public interest?
MR. ISAACMAN:

There are two public interests.

With

QUESTION:

Mr. Grutman, I guess there are those who

think that the conduct of certain newspapers in pursuing

Mr. Hart recently was of the same unwarranted character.

6

Should that result in some kind of liability?

20

something which is so repellent --

QUESTION:

that what the newspapers did with regard to Mr. Hart fell in

that category?

I make out of it the fact that the jury

said that this was not describing actual facts about the

QUESTION:

1

I don't know why you insist on this

2

because if there's anything factual about this statement, you

3

certainly have to contend with New York Times.

4

nothing factual about it, you don't have to contend with it at

5

6

plenty, that using opinion or parody to inflict emotional

considerably different proposition than what you've been

pushing.

10

And if there's

All you have to say or all you have to win, which is

MR. GRUTMAN:

I agree that parody or so-called

11

satire, whatever it calls itself, is not necessarily protected

12

speech when the purpose of the publisher is to inflict severe

3

emotional distress.

And while the contention is made in the

4

argument that you've heard this morning that this was a parody,

15

I think that the jury could properly examine this and recognize

6

it for what it is.

A fig leaf isn't going to protect this kind

7

of a publication from being recognized as the kind of behavior

8

with which the tort of the intentional infliction of emotional

distress is intended to deal.

20

QUESTION:

But you would subject, though, the range

21

of political cartoonists, for example, to that kind of jury

22

inguiry, whether it was vicious enough to warrant recovery.

23

MR. GRUTMAN:

No.

Two things must conjoin.

you have to have is an irresponsible intention on the part of

the defendant to inflict injury.

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

The other is that what the cartoonist, the writer or

the speaker does, constitutes in the mind of the community, an

utterance of such enormity, such a heinous kind of utterance,

Even though he knows it will inflict

MR. GRUTMAN:

It has to be -- correct, because you

of things which people in an imperfect world have got to put up

his mother in an outhouse and saying that she's a whore, and

that when the person involved is an abstemious Baptist

MR. GRUTMAN:

Justice White, I don't think this case

When I tried this

case, we were living in the heyday of Gertz and we had not yet

like you mentioned, you could win under New York Times any

MR. GRUTMAN:

Yes, we could win under New York Times,

19

but I'm suggesting that as a jurist prudential matter, the New

20

York Times formulation of actual malice is inappropriate and

21

irrelevant for this tort for the reason that when you're

22

dealing with the tort of libel, the focus of inquiry, the

gravamen is on the issue of true or falsity in which facts

become the measure of what is true or false, or something which

has been dealt with recklessly.

I disagree, Justice O'Connor, and if

11

you'll give me a moment -- that is the easy way of looking at

it, but that's not what they said.

13

The question answered is, can this be understood as

MR. GRUTMAN:

No.

That is the aristotelian

interpretation of a statement of fact as propounded by

Professors Wexler and Michael in their famous monograph, but in

the common parlance in which we speak, a statement of fact is

an utterance about either an event or a thing or a person which

can be proven either true or false.

that those jury instructions were being fought over in the pit

QUESTION:

4

MR. GRUTMAN:

In this case?

Yes.
In retrospect, I understand what you're

5

saying about that, Justice Marshall, but I was fighting in that

6

case, the suggestion that this was hyperbole or the expression

7

of an opinion, and Judge Turc would not accept the view that

8

the accusation of incest is a crime which constitutes libel per

se, and so I was unable to try the case in that posture.

It's been in existence for a hundred years.

QUESTION:

It's not a new tort.

It's certainly a new tort when applied to

the press.
MR. GRUTMAN:

No, it is not a new tort, because there

Heritage

Reporting Corporation

43
1

MR. GRUTMAN:

To that extent, I agree with you, Mr.

2

Chief Justice.

This is for this Court a tabula rasa, not

3

exactly, however, terra incognita because in this connection,

4

you are guided by the principles that the Court has developed

5

in constitutional interpretations certainly over the last 23

6

years when what has been described as the federalization of the

7

law of libel first began in a commendable context, and has now

8

spread to the point where I believe you are considering either

9

dismantling or discarding Gertz.

And the reason for that is

10

that the press, the press that clamors here for a universal

11

exemption so that they should have license to do what these

12

people have done, and that it should be condoned and considered

13

just a trivial or trifling incident of being a public figure.

MR. GRUTMAN:

Because well, I don't know any place

else to suggest that it ought to be.

6

experience has shown us has been the unworkability of that

rule.

8

9

But I do think that what

For example, in Time v. Hill, which was twenty years
ago, footnote 7, Justice Brennan quoting a Second Circuit case,

10

I think it's called the Sidis case, said speaking about even

11

true revelations may be so intimate and so unwarranted in view

12

of the victim's position as to outrage the community's notion

13

of decency.

14
15
16

So this is a problem that was foreseen more than
twenty years ago, and now the problem is with us.
QUESTION:

Mr. Grutman, I think it would be a

17

different -- you know, if there were a Virginia statute saying,

18

you know, it's tortious to depict someone as committing incest,

19

then you know, the cartoonist knows that he's up against.

20

just to say heinous and just leave it to the jury.

21

for example, it isn't only the incest that offends you, you

22

think that portraying a Baptist minister as having taken a shot

23

or two before he went on to the pulpit, that that would qualify

24

in your notion as heinous?
