ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. CAPIZZI, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CAPIZZI:

9

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice,

10

honorable associate Justices, if it may please the Court, this

11

is a case that will determine whether Mr. Feiock and the

12

Feiocks of this country may sit on their hands and defy with

13

impunity valid court orders to provide support for their minor

14

children.

15

This case originated in the State of Ohio when Alta

16

Sue Feiock, the mother of respondent's three children,

17

petitioned the Ohio courts for support under the Uniform

18

Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, URESA.

19

The petition was forwarded to California, where the

20

Orange County District Attorney's office in turn filed a

21

petition with the California Superior Court seeking an order

22

for support.

23

entered directing payment of $50 per month per child, and that

24

was in fact a reduction from the original $75 per month per

25

child which had been ordered at the time of the divorce some

Following a hearing an order for support was

system, and there is no reason why they should not in matters

QUESTION:

Two million.

MR. CAPIZZI:

Yes.

Of course, that is the 35,000

3

cases are all types, the litigation, the enforcing reciprocal

4

cases from other states, those that have enforcement orders,

5

and the criminal cases that are filed in that connection.

6

There just aren't sufficient resources for even a public agency

7

to pursue cases such as this without reliance on the statute

8

involved in this case, and certainly if a public agency doesn't

9

have the resources, the private individual who often times

10

seeks to assert their own support, enforcement of their own

11

support orders individually couldn't even begin to pursue those

12

on their own.

13

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Capizzi, the California Court of

14

Appeals held that the California statutes make this contempt

15

proceeding criminal in nature.

16

MR. CAPIZZI:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

Now, I guess California is entitled to

determine that for itself as a matter of state law, isn't it?
MR. CAPIZZI:

Well, it can place whatever label it

20

chooses on a case, and this case the court below did term the

21

case criminal.

22

I would submit that the --

QUESTION:

So is it a matter, is it a question of

23

federal law for purposes of answering whether the federal

24

constitution is violated?

25

MR. CAPIZZI:

Heritage

I think that unquestionably it is and

5
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

be that as it may I would submit that the court below was wrong

2

in terming this case criminal even under California law.
QUESTION:

3

Well, but you don't really want us to get

4

in there, do you, and say that the California Court of Appeals

5

was wrong as a matter of California law?

6

that, and can you give me examples of where we have done that?
MR. CAPIZZI:

7

Are we likely to do

Well, I think the Court has always

8

looked to the highest court — this Court has looked to the

9

highest court of the state in determining what the state law

10

is.

11

is a question of federal law for purposes of the federal

12

constitutional question?

13

arguing this, and I had a hard time understanding whether you

14

seriously thought we were going to overturn the California

15

court on a question of what the California law is.

16

QUESTION:

Well, why would we want to do that if it

MR. CAPIZZI:

You spent a lot of time in your brief

No, we merely meant to set the record

17

straight, and point out that the California Supreme Court as

18

held repeatedly that there are still two types of contempt in

19

California, civil and criminal, but that is absolutely correct.

20

As far as the constitutional analysis is concerned, it doesn't

21

matter what label California puts on it.

22

could deprive this Court of determining in what instances the

23

constitutional provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment will or

24

will not apply.

25

Otherwise a state

Now, I suppose we could decide that as a matter of

6

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1

federal law for federal purposes this has the characteristics

2

of a civil proceeding, but that wouldn't mean that California

3

when it went back couldn't treat it as something else for its

4

purposes and under the California constitution.

5

MR. CAPIZZI:

That's true.

California could do that.

6

But they haven't done that in this case.

7

repeatedly said that there's a distinction between civil and

8

criminal contempt, and the California Supreme Court repeatedly

9

over three years has said that civil is to protect the rights

The courts have

10

of litigants and criminal is to vindicate the dignity or

11

authority of the court, and —

QUESTION:

But it is up to California to decide what

13

it is coming with a — I mean, that is a purposive test, and it

14

is California's purpose.

15

criminal, who are we to say that it isn't?

16
17
18

MR. CAPIZZI:

If California says that it is

California has not said that it is

criminal, Justice Scalia.
QUESTION:

You are arguing that it doesn't matter

19

what California said.

20

and I am saying if it is a purposive test you are urging upon

21

us, it does matter.

22

California's purpose is criminal, then that is the end of the

23

matter as far as that issue is concerned.

You are arguing that it doesn't matter,

I agree with you.

I think that California

Yes, Justice Blackmun, that is correct.

They have continued to draw the distinction between civil and

other point that you say, that it doesn't matter what

13

California has done, that even if California has called it

14

criminal, you urge upon us that we are not bound to accept

15

that, and I don't-see how that follows at al.

16

we are bound to accept it.

17

That is a different issue.

You are arguing what

I am asking why it should be true, the

MR. CAPIZZI:

It seems to me

If California should suggest, Justice

18

Scalia, that in a civil case where there are punitive damages

19

those are penal in nature, as they have said in contempt

20

proceedings, the potential of a jail sentence is penal, and

21

because punitive damages are potentially penal, we are going to

22

extend the procedural safeguards of a criminal case, not

23

because they are constitutionally required, but because as a

24

state we are going to extend those rights in the civil case.

25

Thus we would has we have in the contempt setting, have a

8

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1

description of these civil cases as quasicriminal or criminal

2

in nature because we have extended procedural safeguards

3

otherwise available in criminal cases, and then respondent

4

would come before you and say, because these are criminal in

5

nature we have extended the safeguards of a criminal case, the

6

libel case in which we are seeking punitive damages, that, too,

7

is criminal.

8
9

The tort case where we are seeking punitive damages,
that, too, is criminal.

The bad faith insurance case where we

10

are seeking punitive damages, that, too, is criminal, and that

11

would deprive this Court of determining when and in what

12

setting the constitutional provisions of the due process clause

13

are to apply, and I would submit that the appropriate test is

14

to analyze what the hearing is substantively.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Capizzi, I am looking at page A6 of

16

the petition for writ of certiorari where you have the opinion

17

of the Court of Appeal, and I am looking at the second full

18

paragraph on the page, the second sentence, where its says,

19

"Our Supreme Court recently discussed the problem raised by the

20

use of presumptions in criminal cases in people against Roder."

21

Now, does the Court of Appeal opinion have any more

22

discussion than tat of why it considered this a criminal

23

proceeding rather than civil proceeding?

24
25

MR. CAPIZZI:

No.

I would submit that it is lacking

in analysis as to why it considered it a criminal proceeding.

9

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

628-4888

QUESTION:

1

Have there been other cases from the

2

Supreme COurt of California that have said this kid of

3

proceeding is a criminal rather than a civil proceeding?
MR. CAPIZZI:

4
5

No.

In fact, the Roder case did not

say a contempt proceeding is a criminal proceeding.

6

QUESTION:

Roder wasn't a contempt case, was it?

7

MR. CAPIZZI:

No, it was not a contempt.

8

the constitutionality of a state statute involving a

9

presumption and prima facie case.
QUESTION:

10

It involved

What significance do you give to the

11

sentence on page A8, contempt is quasi-criminal and requires

12

proof beyond a reasonable doubt?

13

MR. CAPIZZI:

14

required for in excess of 100 years.
QUESTION:

15
16
17

That is what the California courts have

In civil contempt proceedings as well as

criminal?
MR. CAPIZZI:

In civil as well as criminal, and that

18

is why civil contempt proceedings because they have the

19

potential for a jail sentence if the coercive order is

20

violated, they have been given in civil contempt proceedings

21

many of the procedural safeguards that would otherwise be

22

available to a criminal defendant, and as a result, over the

23

100 years or so, the civil contempt proceedings have been

24

referred to as quasi-criminal and criminal in nature, but that

25

doesn't make them criminal substantively, and as this Court has

10

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

said in Shilitani versus United States, that we are going to

2

look at the substance, not the procedure by which the order for

3

contempt came about.

4

Shillitani was a case under Rule 42, the Rules of

5

Criminal Procedure.

As Justice Harland pointed out in footnote

6

3 in a dissenting opinion, but it called attention to the

7

record below, the judgment and commitment was for guilty of

8

criminal contempt but this Court went beyond the procedural

9

aspects of it and looked at the matter substantively, and

10

because the order of two years in jail or until purging oneself

11

of contempt by testifying before the grand Jury was the order,

12

it was concluded that it was coercive and not subject to the

13

procedural aspects of a true criminal case.

14
15

QUESTION:

What was the procedure that was involved

there that we said was not necessary?

16

MR. CAPIZZI:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. CAPIZZI:

19

QUESTION:

In Shillitani?

Yes.
It was the jury trial.

Now, you are urging here that what is not

20

necessary is not only — not only the burden of persuasion —

21

not only the burden of initiation of the evidence, production

22

being placed on the plaintiff, but also the burden of

23

persuasion.

24

although this individual should not be liable for the payments

25

unless he can afford them, although that is part of these, if

So if I understand your case correctly, it is that

11

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

the court can't make up its mind, if it is unclear, I don't --

2

if the court finally concludes on the basis of all the

3

evidence, I cant really tell whether he can afford these

4

payments or not, the court will then send him to jail.

5

That is what you are urging.

6

MR. CAPIZZI:

No, we are not, Justice Scalia.

We are

7

urging that since this is a civil case, the determination of

8

whether the statute meets the due process clause of the

9

Fourteenth Amendment should be analyzed in terms of a civil

10

rule, and in a civil context.

11

QUESTION:

The Court of Appeals certainly ruled

12

clearly enough that the burden of proving the ability to pay is

13

on the prosecution.

14

MR. CAPIZZI:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. CAPIZZI:

17

The Court expressed that, and again —

As a matter of California law.
But it misstated California law,

Justice White.

18

QUESTION:

Well, I don't know how you can convince us

19

of that, but I thought that — I didn't read your brief and

20

disagree especially with that.

21

that an inference of the ability to pay could be drawn from

22

that.

MR. CAPIZZI:

— and there is a violation, it hasn't-

4

5

even if we are to —

6

QUESTION:

You are just saying that the statute says

7

that the prosecution's burden is satisfied when you prove the

8

things that you just mentioned.

9

MR. CAPIZZI:

That is correct, and that is consistent

10

with an early California Supreme Court case, In re McCarty,

11

which likewise said those are the three elements of contempt.

12

In that case it was an alimony case, but there should be no

13

difference for that analysis between the alimony case and the

14

child support case, and that was the rule in California for a

15

number of years.

16

QUESTION: Did your brief argue that this statute

17

shifted the burden of persuasion on ability?

18

just said it shifted the burden of production.

QUESTION:

5

That's correct, Justice O'Connor.

Again, you don't want us to decide that,

do you?
MR. CAPIZZI:

I don't think it is necessary.

It is a

6

civil case, and as a civil case either a burden of production

7

or a burden of proof is appropriate, and the statute places

8

this case in much the same position if not identical position

9

as the circumstances this Court addressed in Rylander versus

10
11
12

United States.

The statute —

QUESTION:

Well, Rylander involved a situation where

only the burden of production shifted.

13

MR. CAPIZZI:

14

QUESTION:

15

That's correct, Justice O'Connor..

Well, do you lose this case if the burden

of persuasion is also involved and placed on the defendant?

16

MR. CAPIZZI:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. CAPIZZI:

No,

I don't believe we do.

I don't think you do, either.
It is a civil case, and regardless of

19

whether it is the burden of persuasion or the burden of

20

production, there is a rational connection between the proven

21

fact and the presumed fact.

22

just for the sake of argument that this were a criminal case,

23

that the statute would meet the heavier beyond a reasonable

24

doubt standard that is required in the criminal case.

25

if we have an individual who is ordered to pay support,

Heritage

I would submit, however, assuming

15
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

It is -I think

1

it is — a reasonable person would seek to modify that order if

2

he could no longer make the support payments.

3

His failure to seek modification causes the missed

4

payments to accrue and build in arrearage, which some day he is

5

going to have to pay, as he was ordered to pay even in this

6

case, because even though he was found not guilty on some of

7

the months of contempt, at the time of the hearing he was still

8

found able to pay in installments and was ordered to make

9

payments even for those months for which he could not have been

10

held in contempt because of the coercive nature of it and the

11

fact that the missed support payments accrue.

12

Now, a reasonable person would seek to modify that

13

order if he truly had no ability to pay.

14

seek modification is a tacit admission that the order remains

15

valid and reliable.

16

having enacted a code section, Civil Code 4700.1, that makes it

17

extremely easy for an individual to modify a support order.

18

is almost as though it is a small claims action, and attorneys

19

are not required, and its express purpose is to make it easy to

20

modify a support order.

21

And his failure to

And that is especially true in California,

It

So given those factors, it seems to me a reasonable

22

person would modify and an unmodified order supports the

23

presumed fact beyond a reasonable doubt that the original order

24

is still valid.

25

or not, and whether you argue it here or not,

2

3

that most states do place the burden on the defendant, not just

4

for production but of persuasion.

5

MR. CAPIZZI:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. CAPIZZI:

8

9

I had the

Is that —

That's correct.

That is correct.
It is a burden of producing — or

burden of proof in most states.
I would submit that with respect to whether in this

10

case it was a burden of production or a burden of proof, we

11

should look to the cases in California which have said that it

12

was a burden of production.

13

California which say it is a burden of production, 1209.5.

14

should look to Penal Code section 270, the criminal nonsupport

15

section, and the California Supreme Court, People versus

16

Sorenson, interpreting a presumption in that criminal section

17

very comparable to the presumption here as being one involving

18

the burden of producing evidence.

19

We should look to the treatises in
We

Now, I submit that we should examine those even

20

though they were ignored by the Court of Appeal below, and the

21

reason we should examine those is because even though the court

22

below ignored them, the trial judge didn't.

23

Ulster versus Allen, in Footnote 16, this Court said we should

24

look to the jury instructions and how it was treated at the

25

trial level.

Heritage

And just as in

17
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

The presumption in this case was treated at the trial

2

level by the trial judge as one affecting the burden of proof.

3

All of the other cases, the treatises, were available to him.

4

He expressed an awareness of the long-standing law.

5

expressly stated on the record that he was treating it as

6

affecting the burden of going forwards, which is another way of

7

saying the burden of producing evidence.

9

And he

And it was based on the way it was treated by the
trial court and the laws in California which treats a

10

presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence almost

11

the same way as this Court analyzed a- permissive inference in

12

Allen — in Ulster County versus Allen.

13

The Evidence Code Section 604, which sets forth how

14

that presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence is

15

to be used is almost identical to the definition of a

16

permissive inference in Ulster County versus Allen, and

17

therefore even if we were to assume that it was a criminal

18

case, I submit that it was treated by the trial court as a

19

burden, as a presumption affecting the burden of producing

20

evidence, and as such meets the due process requirements of the

21

Fourteenth Amendment.

that this man had an ability to pay, and I therefore hold him

produced evidence under California law that showed the

22

nonexistence of the presumed fact, then the court was required

23

to treat the evidence without reference to the presumption, and

testimony of the respondent, he found him guilty of the five

it was based upon the testimony of the defendant.

17

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD LYNN SCHWARTZBERG, ESQ.

18

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

19

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

20

please the Court, the issue, contrary to a number of the amicus

21

briefs that were filed in this case, I would suggest, is rather

22

narrow, and I would suggest it has almost no national

23

importance.

24

of a very specific California statute which affects a civil

25

contempt in the criminal venue for only California makes that

What we are here to decide is the interpretation

20

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

definition. What I would suggest, however, is that the

2

significance of this debate concerns almost a century of

3

California jurisprudence concerning civil contempt.

4

What I would suggest to the Court is that there are a

5

number of rigs which this Court in Boykin versus Alabama has

6

applied to criminal cases, which, if this Court adopts the

7

position of the petitioner, will eviscerate, will essentially

8

vacate.
Those rights are self-incrimination, both the right

9
10

not to have to testify and the right not to be called as

11

witnesses, the right to counsel in California, and I would

12

suggest a right which is perhaps more fundamental than those

13

rights in Boykin versus Alabama, that is the right to have

14

proof beyond a reasonable doubt as to each and every element of

15

the charge as contained in the case, this Court's case of In re

16

Winship.

17

I would suggest that whether 1209.5 violated the

18

Fifth Amendment involves three questions.

19

is, does 1209, which is the general scheme for contempts in

20

California, define a crime with the element of the ability to

21

pay.

22

definition of a crime to suit the Court's federal

23

interpretation of what a civil contempt is.

24

it offend the Fifth Amendment if it is a crime?

25

The first question

Second, if it does, may this Court redefine that

And finally, does

I think that the answer to whether 1209 defines a

21

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

crime in California is an unequivocal yes.

2

Court needs to do is to turn to a case which was decided in the

3

1940s called Bennet versus Superior Court, and I would merely

4

quote the first line of the third paragraph on Page 210, where

5

the Court says, "Contempt of court is a specific criminal

6

offense."

7

In fact, all the

Now, they get that from McClatchie versus Superior

8

Court, which is at 119 Cal.

They get that from In Ex Parte

10

12

with such short shrift with the question of whether it was

13

criminal or not, and the answer is simple.

14

15

analysis of that issue because every Court of Appeal knows what

16

it is.

17

Now, one of the questions that the Court asked Mr.

They knew what it

And there wasn't any need to have any particular extended

QUESTION:

Mr. Schwartzberg, it seems to me that what

18

the California Court of Appeals did ultimately was to say that

19

the California statute as applied here was invalid as a matter

20

of federal constitutional law.

21

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

22

QUESTION:

I would concede that, yes.

So is it not also a question of federal

23

law whether this statute is indeed civil in nature or criminal

24

for purposes of answering the federal constitutional question?

25

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

No, Justice O'Connor, no more

22

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

than
QUESTION:

2

No?

I would have thought perhaps it was,

3

that if we are going to say the federal Constitution strikes it

4

down because it is criminal in nature, that it is a matter of

5

federal law whether this thing is criminal in nature for

6

federal purposes.

7

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

Well, I think the answer to that

8

is this.

If, for whatever reason, the federal government had

9

no murder statute, and then, in fact, let us assume that murder

10

on the federal level was never a crime, but California chose to

11

treat murder as a crime, a felony, and they had a statute that

12

was similar to that in Martin versus Ohio, I don't think this

13

Court would have any trouble striking that statute down, as

14

violating the Fifth Amendment.

15

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Schwartzberg, what about a case

16

like Shillitani v. The United States which at least indicates

17

that we are free to examine the purpose of the contempt

18

proceeding and characterize it as civil in this instance

19

because it was for the purpose of coercing the payment of the

20

money.

21

MR. SCHWARTZBERT:

I don't know how to reconcile that

22

with California, and I think California would have trouble

23

reconciling it with Shillitani.

24

think, that the Supreme Court in Culver City tried to make it

25

clear that California was not -- I think the problem here is

It is the same reason, I

23

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1

that the legislature used the label "civil."
The fact is that the courts have been calling it a

2
3

"crime."

Not criminal in nature, not a criminal action, but a

4

crime in California.
QUESTION:

5

Well, I think that is perfectly all right

6

if California wants to do that.

7

California court that has rested its holding on the Federal

8

Constitution.

9

leave California free to call it whatever it wants and impose

10

whatever requirements it wants as a matter of California law.

Now, we can decide that issue, I suppose, and

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

11

The problem is that we have a

I think the difficulty with that

12

is that we are putting the cart before the horse.

I think that

13

what the Court of Appeal said was that what we have here is a

14

crime.

15

the State of California.

16

you had it as a crime, then the decision such as this Court's

17

decision in Rylander do not have any effect.

18

essence, once you determine this is a criminal act, a crime

19

punishable as a crime in California, that this Court's opinions

20

then presuppose that various rights inure.

21

rights is the Fifth Amendment.

A crime no different than any misdemeanor or felony in
And their conclusion was that once

And then that, in

And one of those

22

And what I would suggest to the Court --

23

QUESTION:

I assume that to some extent, the answer

24

to Justice O'Connor's question must depend upon what the

25

Federal test for criminality is.

If the Federal test for

24

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1

criminality is purpose, if whether the purpose of the penalty

2

is to coerce or to punish and if the State says:

3

in applying these penalties is to punish, it would be very hard

4

for us to say, "No, you are wrong, California.

5

not to punish."

California is certainly dispositive as to what

6

its purpose is.

So, it would depend on what test we are

7

applying; wouldn't it?

8

9

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

Our purpose

Your purpose is

Not only that, but I would go one

step further. And what I would suggest to the Court and I tried

10

to present it in my brief, which is that California has a very

11

unusual legislative scheme which is that we have 166, which is

12

a specific penal statute governing contempt of court and it

13

covers the same act, the same exact act that is prosecuted

14

here.

15

The difference between "civil contempt" under 1209

16

and criminal intent in 166 is that only the people in the State

17

of California can bring a 166 action, but a civil litigant, in

18

other words, a custodial parent, typically, the mother, can

19

hire counsel and bring a civil contempt which is a criminal

20

action.

21

And for that reason, what I am suggesting is that the

22

California Supreme Court in Culver City and going all the way

23

back to Gould said there are -- all these contempts are

24

contained in different places in our legislative scheme, but

25

they are all the same crime.

Heritage

They just carry different kinds

of right.
QUESTION:

May I pursue Justice O'Connor's inquiry

3

with a hypothetical?

Supposing a state differently from all

4

other states passed a statute saying that the negligent

5

operation of a motor vehicle shall be a crime.

6

(1) you can go to jail, and all the rest of it, but also have a

7

separate proceeding that the person thereby injured by proof,

8

just by a preponderance of the evidence that he was hurt by the

9

negligent operation, after he proves a crime by a preponderance

10

of the evidence, he can get damages.

11

the Fifth Amendment?

12

And it said,

Would that comport with

They call it a crime and they say the private

13

litigant gets a remedy on the basis of it by a preponderance of

14

the evidence. Does the fact they call it a crime mean that

15

Winship applies?

16

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

Well, I am having a little bit of

17

trouble with the analogy because I am not entirely certain as

18

to whether the courts are determining that the civil cause of

19

action is itself a crime.

20

QUESTION:

Yes, the statute says:

Negligent

21

operation of the vehicle is a crime.

And it may be proved.

22

The crime may be proved in a civil proceeding by a

23

preponderance of the evidence.

24

instruct them that having done this is a crime and the

25

consequence of the crime is you have got to pay damages to the

2

take it, would require all these other protections.

3

The fact that they call it a crime, in your view, I

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

I would be less than frank if I

4

told the Court I really can answer that question.

5

because I — in essence, what you are saying is that a private

6

prosecutor can come in and obtain damages for a crime.

7

QUESTION:

No.

I can't

What I am saying is what a state

8

calls the proceeding may not be binding on us in interpreting

9

the Federal Constitution.

10

That's what I am saying.

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

I hope that this does not devolve

11

into a semantics debate because I don't think that when we say

12

we are calling it a crime that that is all we are doing and

13

that it is not a crime in fact.

14

QUESTION:

But do you say, though, that the

15

California rules applicable to this kind of proceeding.should

16

be judged by the same standards that apply to similar rules

17

that produce similar consequences in other states except they

18

don't call it a crime.

19

20

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

I don't think that they have

anything to do with each other.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

I just don't.

So, our case pertains only to California?
Yes. And that's why I say

I think

23

that contrary to some of the amicus who are concerned about the

24

national ramifications of this, I don't think they have any.

25

QUESTION:

Well, what if California that has a

statute that says, for negligently driving while drunk, you can

6

burden of proof.

7

says one of those procedural aspects is invalid under Federal

8

Constitution, can we not reexamine to see whether or not this

9

meets the definition of a "crime" for some of our cases?

10

We think it is a criminal

And then we talk about presumptions and what the
Now, can this Court if a California court

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

Well, I think the answer to that

11

is that if the California court's interpretation is unambiguous

12

that notwithstanding the fact that this may only involve an

13

administrative penalty, whether it is loss of license, loss of

14

privilege, loss of money or jail, I think that if the

15

California court says that in California, that act is a crime,

16

then I think this court, not bound to accept that

17

determination, in effect, I think this Court must apply those

18

Federal constitutional guarantees which apply to a criminal act

19

within the context of this Court's decisions.

20

So, I would concede, for instance, that this Court

21

does not require counsel in every criminal proceeding, but that

22

does not mean that in those criminal proceedings where the

23

Court does require counsel.

24

is not de minimis that counsel has to be applied in that

backwards, if the Court notes that California courts have

And isn't this California's participation

contempt remedy is not --

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

QUESTION:

2

Yes.

And there is an indication, is there not,

3

in that uniform act that these proceedings are civil in nature

4

for purposes of the uniform act and are designed to coerce the

5

parent who is not making the payments to make the payments.

6

That is the idea of the uniform act; isn't it?

7

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

8

but that act does not supercede 1209.
QUESTION:

9

There is no question about that,
And 1209 is a crime.

Would it be more accurate to say they have

10

dealt with contempt proceedings as a matter of California law

11

as quasi-criminal?

12

maybe?

Would that be a little more accurate,

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

13

I would say that the courts when

14

they get to the issue of what species this is, whether it is

15

criminal or civil, have used a number of different labels to

16

govern it.

17

Scalia that one of the -- apart from looking at the direct

18

language of the courts to determine whether California

19

considers this a crime is to use deduction and work backwards.

20

And that is to look at what the courts have done and the only

21

way you can conclude that a defendant on a criminal action or a

22

contempt action in California has a right to counsel, which

23

most states don't provide, has a right to Fifth Amendment

24

privileges most states don't provide.

25

And that is why I suggested a moment to Justice

QUESTION:

Well, don't you suppose, Mr. Schwartzberg,

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

that because one of the consequences of this coercive

2

proceeding may be imposition of a jail term that a state as a

3

matter of state law might want to build in extra protections,

4

such as a higher standard of proof.
MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

5

But, Justice O'Connor, I would

6

agree with you if I could find in the cases — and I have read

7

them over and over, again — any reference either to

8

California's own constitutional provisions which govern the

9

Fifth Amendment which govern the right to counsel.
The truth is that they all relate back to the Fifth

10

Amendment.

12

decided by the same Court of Appeal which decided In re:

13

Feiock, the Court of Appeal again noted that this was a

criminal proceeding and based upon Supreme Court language from

contempt action had a right not to be called as a witness and

17

that that was compelled not by California's Constitution, but

18

by the Fifth Amendment.

Yes, in fact, when the Court looks

15

at City of Culver City v. Superior Court, essentially, the

16

petitioners in Culver City stand before the court asking them

17

to tell them what kind of contempt this is because they are

18

obviously looking at other jurisdictions and recognizing that

19

depending on what kind of a contempt it is, they get different

20

rights.

And the Supreme Court said,

"We don't care what you

call it, because it is all the same."

And what I am saying is if he makes the

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

It is clear that essentially

20

through the minority of his children's lives, if he never

21

misses a payment he will not go to jail.

22

QUESTION:

So, it is clear that this order in other

23

jurisdictions would be treated as a coercive and a civil

contempt.

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

Correct.

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

Let me go a little but further

2

here and indicate to the Court this.

One of the things that I

3

think this case presents by the petitioner is essentially --

4

comes out of some for the same questions as the Court was

5

asking Mr. Capizzi, and that is do we essentially allow

6

petitioner to relitigate the definition of state law before

7

this Court when they have essentially lost that opportunity in

8

the Courts below?

9

these issues, if the Court looks through the original briefs

What I would suggest to the Court is that

10

that were filed in this case, the Court will notice two things.

11

Petitioner never argued to the Court of Appeal that this was

12

not a crime.

13

Appeal that as an element of that crime we add ability to pay.

14

And Number Two, they never argued to the Court of

Essentially they went to the Court of Appeal and they

15

argued that 1209.5, notwithstanding these two assumptions, did

16

not offend the Fifth Amendment, and perhaps that is why you

17

have the Court of Appeal providing short shrift to what we are

18

now arguing amongst ourselves.

19
20
21

The fact is that petitioner has also argued in their
brief, and I have had —
QUESTION:

Well, yes, but the Court of Appeal didn't

22

give short shrift to the notion that this is the kind of a

23

proceeding in which shifting the burden of persuasion is

24

unconstitutional.

25

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

Heritage

No, because they knew from the

38
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

outset that they were dealing with a crime in California, and

2

once they had that as a predicate, then the only other question

3

that they had to resolve was whether the wording of 1209.5

4

offended the Fifth Amendment, and they didn't have any trouble

5

reaching that conclusion either.

6

they wouldn't have any trouble is because essentially this

7

shifts everything onto the defendant.

8
9
10
11
12

QUESTION:

And the reason we know that

We know that.

You seem to be arguing that we just aren't

entitled at all to ask whether or not this is close enough to a
crime to trigger these protections.
MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

I would be fearful to use the word

entitled, but I would hope to argue to the Court --

13

QUESTION:

Don't be fearful.

14

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

I would hope to argue to the Court

15

that, yes, the answer is is that this case is very similar in

16

some respects to Runi.

17

that what the Court is being asked to do is to rewrite the

18

opinion but I think that the answer has to remain the same.

I mean I just -- I see-- my view is

19

My belief is, and I think that the cases support it,

20

and in fact in the reply brief that petitioner filed just last

21

week essentially petitioners -- I consider their central

22

argument to be on Page 9 that this Court must define the

23

subject matter of a statute solely in federal terms.

24

is true then what I would suggest is that if the federal

25

government in 49 states make a wrong a civil cause of action,

Heritage

39
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

If that

1

providing for injunctive relief, let's say pouring 1,000

2

gallons or sulfuric acid down a drain, they make it a civil

3

wrong, they allow for injunctive relief to stop it from

4

happening, and damages to punish the wilful or the wrongdoer

5

for what he did, and California thinks that it is more

6

important to protect its citizens on its water quality because

7

we don't have any water in California, and so they make it a

8

felony.

9

Essentially what I see petitioner arguing is that he

10

would come here and say it is not a crime, because nobody else

11

makes it a crime, and perhaps it wasn't a crime under common

12

law.

13

QUESTION:

So the example would have to be they made

14

it a felony but they way the only remedy for committing this

15

felony is an injunction or a cease and desist order.

16

did that would your position be just as strong?

17

MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

I don't know.

If they

I would suggest to

18

the Court that if California chooses to make something

19

criminal, and we are getting back to the semantic argument, I

20

don't know how to get out of t, and this is the problem I think

21

you have seen in our briefs, if they make something criminal,

22

does the definition of a crime only flow from the punishment,

23

and I don't know that the answer to that is true, because there

24

are many acts in society which may be labeled a crime which

25

perhaps don't even carry the punishment.

But I think you have agreed that

2

California could solve this problem.

3

with their lawsuit, they could have gone to the Supreme Court

and said, we want a new rule defining this species of contempt

the same way every other state does.
MR. SCHWARTZBERG:

6

Instead of coming here

Justice Stevens, they did, and

7

they got one vote.

I mean, I think that is why we are here,

not known what this is, they have seen various rights being

10

compelled by the Fifth Amendment.

11

12

haven't amended the statute of 1209, and the reason for that is

because they are guite content with what it is.

If that is true and they want to keep this

scare these people into paying their money, and that is what

makes it coercive, but the same argument is true that that is
