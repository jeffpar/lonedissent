CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument now in

4

No. 86-1329, Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation versus Mayacamas

5

Corporation.

6

Mr. Bien, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

7

MR. BIEN:

8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court.

9

I'd like to open this afternoon with a very brief

10

statement of the case and next comment on the nature of the

11

issue as it was faced by the District Court, and then turn to

12

the matter of appellate jurisdiction.

13

As set forth in the briefs, while appellate

14

jurisdiction does not stand or fall on the merits of any

15

particular rule, it seems quite clear that the presence of

16

appellate jurisdiction does turn on both the nature and the

17

importance of the ruling, and on the practicalities of delaying

18

appellate review.

19

Now, the underlying facts and legal issues of this

20

case are completely unremarkable from a Federal point of view.

21

What is remarkable from that standpoint is the notion that a

22

Federal Court should undertake to adjudicate this type of

23

dispute when a competent State court was already doing so on

24

the exact same issues, exact same parties, and when removal had

25

been available to the State Court defendant but had been
foregone.

Heritage

(202) 628-4888

After summarizing the case, I will argue that the

1
2

Federal suit that resulted was not only identical and

3

duplicative of the State Court lawsuit, but because removal had

4

been available the duplicative Federal suit was wholly

5

unnecessary even from the Federal plaintiff's point of view.

6

And wholly without justification under this Court's decisions

7

or under the intention of Congress since 1789 when Congress

8

created the removal process.

9
10

QUESTION:

Mr. Bien, as I understand it, the Georgia

suit went to trial and there's a judgment.

11

MR. BIEN:

I will be addressing that.

12

QUESTION:

Is that right?

13

MR. BIEN:

Yes, Your Honor.

14

QUESTION:

And have you filed any motion in the

15

Federal District Court now to dismiss the suit on res judicata

16

grounds or something?

17

MR. BIEN:

No.

The Georgia case, as I reported in

18

our Reply Brief, went to a jury trial in early November and a

19

verdict for Mayacamas, the respondent, was entered and judgment

20

ensued.

21

or Friday, Mayacamas has filed papers in the trial court in

22

Georgia seeking a new trial, and because of the outcome, we

23

certainly expect on Gulfstream's part that whatever the outcome

24

of the new trial proceedings in Georgia, it will be followed by

25

an appeal by Mayacamas as well.

I'm advised by counsel for the respondent that today

QUESTION:

But you haven't reached the appellate

stage yet?

2

MR. BIEN:

No.

3

QUESTION:

Surely you will appeal?

4

MR. BIEN:

I can state on Gulfstream's behalf that we

5

will not appeal.

6

QUESTION:

You will not appeal?

7

MR. BIEN:

We will not appeal.

8
9
10
11
12

We may cross appeal

if Mayacamas appeals, but we will not appeal.
So in answering your question, Justice O'Connor, I
believe that -QUESTION:

No further motions have been filed in the

Federal District Court as a result of what's transpired?

13

MR. BIEN:

Not as of yet.

14

QUESTION:

You would acknowledge that it's moot if

15
16

Not as of yet.

Mayacamas doesn't take an appeal?
MR. BIEN:

If Mayacamas does not take an appeal and

17

if a Federal Trial Judge, District Judge finds res judicata to

18

be applicable, and if there's a dispute that is resolved in

19

favor of res judicata on appeal, then I think technical

20

mootness would apply.

21
22
23

However, I would still argue, as I would argue now,
but I think there's more strength -QUESTION:

Wait a minute.

Before you do that, why do

24

each one of those things have to happen.

25

is that it would be res judicata.

Part of your argument

I mean, that's essential to

your whole contention here.

issue here.
QUESTION:

3
4

Well, we don't reach the res judicata

You don't think that's essential to your

contention that this is duplicative litigation?
MR. BIEN:

5

Well, assuming that a final decision in

6

one forum or the other, let's say in a State forum, was reached

7

and there was finality, then we would certainly argue that -QUESTION:

8
9

So res judicata is assumed.

So

isn't it the case then that if an appeal is not taken this is

10

over?

11

over?

12

Right.

If Mayacamas does not take an appeal, this litigation is

MR. BIEN:

I think the judgment would have to be

13

afforded full faith and credit in the Federal Court, and that

14

would effectively end the dispute.

15

reason why a res judicata would not follow but I can't envision

16

any such reason at this point.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

Unless there were some

Indeed, you're arguing that there is res

judicata, that's part of your argument?
MR. BIEN:

Well, again, I don't believe that the

20

reason to avoid duplicative litigation is that the prospect of

21

a res judicata now here in the Federal Court, but in either

22

Court, creates the kind of tension and pressure on both courts

23

that's undesirable.

24

but I'm saying that we don't argue the, and in this particular

25

case, we haven't argued it in the briefs and I'm not arguing it

So I don't know if I'm quibbling with you,

this morning what the specific res judicata effect would be.
6

Heritage

1

I assume, without arguing, that there would be a res

2

judicata effect eventually.

But I do want to address the

3

mootness problem in one more step and I think that even if the

4

res judicata did arise as a result of the verdict that was

5

reached in Georgia, I think you have a classic situation where

6

the issues now before this Court would be capable of repetition

7

even as addressed to Gulfstream which is a party which is a

8

large corporation may face that situation.

9

always arises at the beginning of the lawsuit.

And the issue
And I think

10

it's a classical case where it could evade review if even a

11

technical mootness would have the result of —

12
13

QUESTION:

Between these parties?

These parties are

planning to go through this —

14

MR. BIEN:

Not these particular parties.

15

QUESTION:

But isn't that what the capable of

16
17

repetition requires?
MR. BIEN:

Well, I believe that under the Roe v. Wade

18

in the pregnancy situation and some others, that it doesn't

19

necessarily have to affect the particular party.

20

QUESTION:

But what of the some others?

21

MR. BIEN:

I believe the Blumstein case, the Dunn v.

22

Blumstein, where the challenge to election rules where even if

23

the particular plaintiff that brought the case may not have

24

been in a position to vote in a state with a challenged

25

election procedure that there might have been other voters who
are facing the exact same situation which if it was not

adjudicated by this Court might once again have the issue evade

2

with you.

3

just did want to complete my answer to that question.

4
5

QUESTION:

May I ask just one question to be sure I

The $900,000 award to your opponent, is that a net
award or a credit against what you claimed.

8

MR. BIEN:

No.

10

QUESTION:

Net award.

11

MR. BIEN:

We would have to pay them $900,000.

12

QUESTION:

Okay.

9

13

I

understand the result of the trial.

6

7

But I don't believe we'll have to get that far.

This is as I understand it a net

award.

That's what I thought but I wanted

to be sure.

Just very briefly in terms of the facts of the

18

involved as to the decision on the merits. Gulfstream makes

In June of 1983,

The next progress payment was due about two years

23

later by the end of August of 1985.

Two weeks before the

24

deadline, Mayacamas claimed that Gulfstream had breached the

25

contract and violated representations made about the production
schedule so that the value of Mayacamas' purchase had been

Reporting Corporation

diminished.
As the deadline for the second payment, which was

2

3

equal to the original payment, passed, there were mutual

4

threats of each side being in breach of the contract, threats

5

of litigation on both sides.

6

later, Gulfstream elected to file a lawsuit for breach of

7

contract in a State Court in Georgia.

1985.

9

And about a month and a half

This came on October 9,

Now, its undisputed in this case that Mayacamas being

10

a corporate citizen of the State of California, could have

11

removed Gulfstream's State court action to the Federal Court in

12

the State of Georgia, but did not do so.

13
14

QUESTION:

Do I understand you to say that they could

have removed it of course?

15

MR. BIEN:

Why is that?

16

QUESTION:

You have just said that they could have

17

removed it to Federal Court?

18

MR. BIEN:

That's correct.

19

QUESTION:

If that step had been taken, could the

20

case have been transferred to the Northern District of

21

California -- is that where it was?

22

MR. BIEN:

Mayacamas, if it felt that California was

23

a more convenient forum, certainly had a Motion under Title 28

24

Section 1404 for a transfer for the convenience of parties and

25

in the interests of justice.

And I might point out that there

is a concession in its brief on the merits here that Georgia

4

QUESTION:

That statement is made in the answering

And if we thought that the action could

5

have been filed in the California District Court, I guess you

6

could have filed a motion there to change venue back to the

7

Georgia District Court.

8

MR. BIEN:

Certainly.

9

QUESTION:

Did you ever file such a motion?

10

MR. BIEN:

No.

11

QUESTION:

No.

12

MR. BIEN:

Our position was that the case shouldn't

13

even proceed in California.

14

Well, in that Mayacamas did not exercise their

15

removal right but filed an independent lawsuit in the District

16

Court in Northern California.

17

Colorado River doctrine for a stay or dismissal of that

18

lawsuit.

order of Denial was issued about a month and a half later on

20

February 21, 1986.

the Colorado River doctrine, notwithstanding the logic of

22

Gulfstream's position about duplicative litigation, the

District Court stated in its written order that this Court must

exercise its jurisdiction.

Opinion

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Bien, as a practical matter, what

2

were the consequences to your client of the District Court's

3

denial of your stay motion?

4

in California or other things done there?

5

MR. BIEN:

Were discovery proceedings started

There were discovery proceedings, as I

6

understand it, going forward in both forums.

7

typical parallel proceeding in both courts where all the

8

potential for conflicting discovery rulings were taking place.

9

Certainly Gulfstream had to incur the cost of two sets of

10

So you had a

attorneys and proceeding in the two different courts.

11

So those impacts were certainly taking place.

12

Our primary argument on the practical impact is that

13

when the District Court insisted on proceeding with this

14

duplicative lawsuit, that it was creating a practical impact on

15

Federalism concerns.

16

QUESTION:

Of course, you said that they insisted on

17

proceeding with it.

The District Court denied a stay and that

18

could have a number of different interpretations.

19

doesn't necessarily mean they were just Hell-bent to race for

20

trial with the Georgia State Court.

21

MR. BIEN:

I mean, that

I think that at the threshold that the

22

ruling in question on our motion citing the availability of

23

removal and arguing under Colorado River that the District

24

Court shouldn't proceed at all, I think that was — and I'm

25

anticipating the problem of appealability here -- I think that
was a conclusive type of ruling.
11

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

There are other kinds of circumstances that might

1
2

have taken place down the road, the District Court perhaps

3

considering purely prudential matters, looking at the

4

practicalities of one suit or another, may possibly have

5

ordered a stay, a temporary stay or a permanent stay later on.

6

But I think the particular ruling that it made came up squarely

7

and appropriately at the threshold that the suit had no

8

business being allowed to proceed at all, given the duplicative

9

lawsuit in the State Court.
And that ruling, I don't think there was any chance

10
11

that there would have been a reconsideration or reevaluation of

12

that legal ruling based upon any future circumstances.

13

that in effect -- I don't know that it would have been a

14

Colorado River motion say a year and a half later -- but

15

perhaps it would have been purely a -- I guess it would have

16

been a discretionary Colorado River motion, after the Court had

17

said that, well the removal factor does not bring this case out

18

of the ordinary realm of discretionary stays.

I think

And a year and a half later, it might have said,

19

20

well, now the Georgia case has proceeded faster or whatever,

21

maybe it would have stayed it, but I think that would have been

22

a fundamentally different kind of ruling down the road.

23

that is where I think the Moses Cone Hospital analysis does not

24

govern our particular case as far as appealability is

25

concerned.
Perhaps I should turn to that.

In Moses Cone

12

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

And

1

Hospital, you had a Court granting a Colorado River type

_2

motion, and the question was at the threshold was is that

_3

appealable.

And the Court ruled that it was appealable for two

different reasons.

One was the rationale under the Idlewild

_5

case that the plaintiff had been put effectively out of court.

_6

But then the Court reached a second ground for appealability,

_7

and that is the doctrine that I primarily rely on here.

8

And

that is the Cohen collateral order doctrine where the three or

_9

perhaps four categories of a narrow class of preliminary

10

orders, of interlocutory orders are deemed appealable.

11

And we certainly I think have all four here.

We have

12

an important issue, indeed I would say we have an historically

13

important issue, given the origins and the purpose of the

14

removal jurisdiction.

15

Hospital, itself, held squarely was separate from the merits.

16

I think when you flip and say that we have an order denying a

17

stay, I think it's still equally separate from the merits.

18

have an order which is not effectively reviewable if you wait

II

until the end of the lawsuit.

20

between the State and Federal courts are moving along as the

21

case proceeds to the final judgment.

22

judgment at the end I think provides no effective recourse at

23

all for this particular problem.

24
25

We have an Order that Moses Cone

All the conflicts and tensions

And to reverse the

And finally, as I was stating in response to the
Chief Justice a little bit earlier, you have a ruling which,
under the analysis of the Moses Cone Hospital, I think is
13

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

We

Corporation

628-4888

1

clearly conclusive in that it's a determined, it's a considered

2

judgment on the significance of the removal factor in the

3

context of identical duplicative lawsuits, and I believe that

4

it's conclusive for two kinds of reasons, both found in Moses

5

Cone Hospital.
One is if you look at the decision of the District

6

7

Judge, it's a memorandum opinion.

8

Colorado River issue, and said the Court must exercise its

9

jurisdiction on those grounds.

10

The Judge considered the

And I believe it fits Moses

Cone Hospital quite clearly.
And we also argue in our briefs if you look back at

11
12

the two companion cases in 1963, one was the Curry case

13

involving National labor relations proceeding, and the one that

14

followed it involving a national bank.

15

just as here, making a decision at the threshold simply to

16

proceed with the lawsuit.

17

defense here, was that the very fact that you're proceeding

18

with the lawsuit is inimicable to a very important federal

19

policy.

20

adjudicated by the Labor Board, and in the second case, in the

21

Lanqdo case, the policy was not to have a national bank sued in

22

a venue not its home venue.

23

You had a trial judge,

And the defense, similar to our

In the one case, the policy to have a labor dispute

QUESTION:

Well, what if the District Court here had

24

said, Mr. Bien, I'm going to deny your motion to dismiss but

25

I'm going to stay all proceedings in this case for six months,
and then you people come back and tell me how the Georgia

Heritage

14
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1
2

litigation is coming.
MR. BIEN:

Do you think that would be appealable?
I believe so.

Because I think when you

3

have the removal factor — and this certainly is our primary

4

argument — there is a preliminary legal determination there

5

that has been made, even if the Court might act differently six

6

months from now.

7

similar to Curry and Langdo that this case belongs here

8

notwithstanding the availability of a removal action.

9
10
11

The preliminary determination has been made

That situation can never change.

It's presented

fully at the threshold and its ruled on.
QUESTION:

Well, you say then that the Northern

12

District of California actually did not have jurisdiction of

13

this action?

14

MR. BIEN:

No, no.

We concede that there is

15

diversity jurisdiction, concede that there's diversity

16

jurisdiction.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

So it's just a question whether the Court

should have proceeded with the case?
MR. BIEN:

That's correct.

That's similar to

20

Colorado River in 1976.

In fact, it's very similar to Iowa

21

Mutual v. LaPlante, which was decided in February of this year

22

where an insurance company in an insurance coverage dispute

23

with some people on an Indian Tribe came to the Federal

24

District Court asserting diversity jurisdiction over a coverage

25

dispute which was in excess of $10,000.
The same dispute looking on the mirror image side of

Heritage

15
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

it had already been before a Tribal Court of the Black Feet

2

Indians, so a Colorado River motion was made and granted.

3

the reason was, conceding the presence of diversity

4

jurisdiction as certainly we do, that the important Federal

5

policy of I think the way it was framed was of maintaining the

6

ability of the Indians to have their self-government and

7

respecting that self-government, called for a stay and a

8

deferral to the Indian Court system.

9

is quite close here.

And

And I think the analogy

10

We concede jurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction.

11

I think what takes this case even beyond Iowa Mutual and beyond

12

Colorado River and all five cases that have come up under the

13

Colorado River doctrine since 1976, is that the insurance

14

company in Iowa Mutual had invoked Federal subject matter

jurisdiction in the only way it could.

3

efforts when there is concurrent jurisdiction as the reason was

4

explained in the Colorado River case, was that Congress had

5

created the jurisdiction for a reason and that there's a

6

presumptive -- I think the court said -- virtually unflagging

7

obligation to exercise that jurisdiction.

Then it could have moved for a transfer and so

The reason why this Court has allowed a duplication of

Here that jurisdiction could have been exercised, and
in way that I think Congress intended since 1789 as a

10

preferable method of exercising diversity jurisdiction in this

11

type of case.

12

framers in the debates made quite clear that they were

13

concerned about Federal diversity actions duplicating State

14

court proceedings on the exact same issue and the same parties.

15

And each of the language of that debates is very reminiscent of

16

this Court's language in such cases as San Carlos Apache, where

17

it talks about an unseemly race to decide the same issues first

18

creating concurrent conflicts and tensions between the Federal

19

and State courts.

As we set forth in our briefs, I think the

language in the Brillhart case talking about an exercise of

think it would have been so much of a problem.

In the Colorado

MR. BIEN:

That's correct, until the appeal is final.

QUESTION:

Well, isn't that an important issue?

MR. BIEN:

I believe it's main importance is deciding

whether the proper ruling by this Court — or if you look from

QUESTION:

Well, it seems to me that that makes a

distinct difference in the State litigation in Georgia on the

one hand, and the Federal litigation in California on the

other.

14

MR. BIEN:

Well, I don't think it does when you

15

consider that on removal to a Federal Court in Georgia, all of

16

Mayacamas' concerns about in personam jurisdiction and

Thank you, Mr. Bien.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY H. WARD, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

6
7
8
9

MR. WARD:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court.
As Mr. Bien has pointed out, the underlying facts in
this particular case are essentially unremarkable.

And the

10

issues which are raised, particularly with respect to

11

determining the appealability of this question are also

12

essentially unremarkable.

13

What we have here is a garden variety civil suit and

14

a garden variety procedural question which was resolved by the

15

District Court, and which should not have been appealed under

16

any doctrine which currently exists or which should exist, and

17

which certainly does not expose the District Court Judge to

18

review by the Court on a writ of mandamus.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Ward, can you state categorically at

20

this point whether your client is going to appeal from the

21

Georgia judgment if your motion for a new trial is denied?

22

MR. WARD:

Your Honor, it is the intention of

23

Mayacamas to move the trial court for a judgment

24

notwithstanding the verdict.

25

QUESTION:

I understand that.

MR. WARD:

And also to request a new trial.
21

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

It is

1

Mayacamas' position that the amount of the award which it

2

received was reduced by local sympathies and that in the event

3

this matter were retried, or tried in California, that the

4

amount of the judgment would be greater.

5

QUESTION:

Are you going to answer my question?

6

MR. WARD:

Yes.

7

QUESTION:

Are you going to appeal if --

8

MR. WARD:

Oh, are we going to appeal if those

9

motions are denied?

10

QUESTION:

Yes.

11

MR. WARD:

Yes, Your Honor.

12

First of all, with respect to the Cohen doctrine

13

which refers to the collateral order exceptions to the final

14

judgment rule, it's Mayacamas' position that this particular

15

issue falls short on all three of the points that must be

16

satisfied for it to be applicable.
First of all, the Order of the District Court did not

17
18

conclusively determine anything.

This order was inherently

19

tentative.

20

there is absolutely no reason to believe that the Court could

21

not reconsider that decision throughout the course of the

22

litigation as various circumstances changed.

23

principal circumstances which is to be considered in a Colorado

24

River analysis is the relative progress of the different

litigations, and that may very well change during the course of

But

I think that unlike a circumstance where a Court has

2

granted a stay, and there may be a conclusion that can be drawn

3

from that that this is a final ruling, that is conclusive,

4

which was this Court's ruling in the Moses H. Cone Hospital

5

case, where we have a Court merely saying, no, let's proceed.

6

That is much more in the nature of a tentative ruling which can

7

be revisited at any time.

I was rather surprised by Mr. Bien's response to the
questioning by the Chief Justice that if the Court were to

order a stay of six months that that would be an appealable

11

order.

12

any length granted by a District Court would be an appealable

order under this Cohen analysis, and that clearly is an

unreasonable interpretation.

Mr. Ward, do you agree with your

opponent's contention that you could have removed this case?

MR. WARD:

Yes, Your Honor.

18

QUESTION:

Is it clear that you can remove a case

19

even when you're challenging in personam jurisdiction?
MR. WARD:

20

I believe that you may remove the case and

21

maintain your jurisdictional challenge, and raise the

22

jurisdictional challenge in Federal court.

23

QUESTION:

Do you believe that or do you know that?

24

MR. WARD:

I believe that, Your Honor.

25

QUESTION:

Do you know cases that hold to that

effect?

Heritage

1

MR. WARD:

No, Your Honor.

2

In this case, Mayacamas' decision was to bring this

3

action in California which it felt was the appropriate forum in

4

light of the fact that all of the transactional events which

5

led up to this particular contract took place in California.

6

Mayacamas felt that it should not be obligated to travel across

7

the country merely because Gulfstream executed its preemptive

8

strike in instituting the action first in Georgia.
Gulfstream's argument is that because they were

9
10

successful, having received notice from Mayacamas that

11

Mayacamas felt that Gulfstream was in breach, that because they

12

were successful in instituting the action in the first instance

13

in Georgia Superior Court that even though Mayacamas as a

14

plaintiff had the statutory right to bring this action in

15

California where jurisdiction over Gulfstream is not contested,

16

that Mayacamas is limited to Federal Court in Georgia.
QUESTION:

17

The alternative, which I presume you

subscribe to, is that what both lawsuits go ahead full steam as

MR. WARD:

District Court was that there are no exceptional circumstances

in this case which would warrant a stay.

QUESTION:

What did you just say?

MR. WARD:

There are no exceptional circumstances —

QUESTION:

So you say that they had no discretion to

MR. WARD:

Well, the District Court in California has

to balance the various factors in determining whether or not to

But prior to the Colorado River doctrine,

I think that it was rather up in the air.
QUESTION:

Let me ask you this.

If Gulfstream had

filed in a Federal Court in Georgia, and then you filed in the
Federal Court in California, now I suppose you would concede
that the Federal Court in California would have discretion to
stay its action?
MR. WARD:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Well, why should it be different if the

Georgia case was in the State Court?
MR. WARD:

Well, it should not be any different.

in California would have discretion to stay its suit if the

QUESTION:

12

Well, if you wanted to get into the

14

going, why wouldn't you have asked for removal to the Federal

15

District Court in Georgia, and then moved for a transfer change

16

of venue to California, if you felt the circumstances warranted

17

it?

18

MR. WARD:

The difficulty with that, Your Honor, is

19

that the standards for removal on a forum non conveniens basis

20

are limited, and they are limited to issues primarily relating

21

to the convenience of the parties and witnesses.

22

Here we have a much more fundamental concern which is

23

a challenge to the jurisdiction of the Georgia Courts in the

24

first instance which would not be taken into consideration by

25

the Court in deciding a forum non conveniens motion, and the
statutory scheme is set up to allow a plaintiff to have his

MR. WARD:

-- it may not have been.

And Mayacamas

7

instead relied on the right provided by statute for it to

8

institute litigation in a Federal Court which had jurisdiction,

9

which had subject matter and in personam jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

10
11

Well, was there an objection on your part

when the Georgia State Court action finally went to trial?

12

MR. WARD:

Yes, Your Honor.

13

QUESTION:

On what ground?

14

MR. WARD:

That the Court lacked jurisdiction to

15

proceed in the action.
QUESTION:

16

But you didn't argue that there was

17

another case pending in the Northern District of California

18

that should prevent it from going to trial?
MR. WARD:

19

No, Your Honor.

And in fact if I may

20

digress from the record just a little bit, Georgia has a

21

statute which reguires its courts to set the matters earlier on

cites, the Local 438 case, the Mercantile Bank case, the John

that what Gulfstream is asking the Court to do is one of two

Well, Justice Scalia asked me that

say that I don't know the answer to that question, Your Honor.

criticized greatly recently, the simplest way to deal with that

is, other than just indicating that there's no longer any basis

you would have had the situation where you'd have two Federal

22

suits, one of which contains as a counterclaim and the other

23

one of which contains as the principal claim the very same

24

contention, right?

25

MR. WARD:

Yes.

QUESTION:

And you think even under those

circumstances, there wouldn't have been a transfer?

2

isn't just -- it's only the convenience of the parties and not

3

the fact that you have exactly the same issue involved that the

4

Court could take into account?
It seems a very strange situation.

5

I mean, it

You would have

6

two Federal suits, one counterclaim and the other one the claim

7

involving exactly the same contention.

8

the time.

9

MR. WARD:

We don't have that all

But we avoided that in this situation,

10

Your Honor, by having Gulfstream file in State Court and not

11

removing to Federal Court.

12

that would be raised by removing to Federal Court and then

13

filing an action in State Court in California would increase

14

Mayacamas' difficulties in getting the case tried in California

15

rather than decrease them.

16

QUESTION:

Certainly we felt that the issues

If it isn't the transfer for the

17

convenience of the party that gets rid of that situation, there

18

must be some other doctrine that gets rid of that situation

19

because you know, I'm just unaware of that proceeding with two

20

Federal courts adjudicating the very same thing.

21

MR. WARD:

I agree, Your Honor.

22

QUESTION:

Although, if there are two Federal courts,

23

one or the other of them's going to stay, isn't it?

24

MR. WARD:

25

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

That certainly would be the presumption.
Thank you, Mr. Ward.

Mr. Bien, you have four minutes remaining.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELLIOT L. BIEN, ESQ.

2

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

3

MR. BIEN:

Thank you.

4

Just to begin with the last point, I think it's the

5

Colorado River and the Kerotest decision on which it relied in

6

the two Federal court situation that would create the solid

7

case law basis for one or the other of those Federal courts

8

deferring to the other.

9

situation that you don't have two duplicative Federal court law

10

suits.

11

on that.

12

There's a strong presumption in that

And I think the law is very strong and certainly clear

The question arose by Justice Scalia and Stevens

13

about whether there might be a waiver of objection to personal

14

jurisdiction in this situation.

15

says that the defendant in a State court can remove any time

16

the District Court would have had original jurisdiction,

17

whether diversity or federal question.

18

that we're talking about subject matter jurisdiction then.

19
20

21
22
23

The Removal Statute itself

And I think it's clear

That there's no premise in the Removal Statute itself
that there must be in personam jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

You say it's clear.

Is that based on some

decision or do you just think it's clear on those words?
MR. BIEN:

Well, the next comment that I was going to

24

make was that this Court had a decision called Polizzi v. Kels

25

Magazines, I can give you the cite now or subsequently, in
which there had been a removal.
36

QUESTION:

1

Do it now.

MR. BIEN:

Certainly.

4

QUESTION:

Thank you.

5

MR. BIEN:

It's a 1953 decision in which this Court

2
3

Polizzi v. Kels Magazines, 345

U.S. 663.

6

ordered the District Court following removal to proceed to

7

examine the challenge to in personam jurisdiction to the

8

sufficiency of the service of process.

9

Morris Treatise also cites Section 1448 of Title 28 as

That case, and also the

10

instructing the District Court following a removal, to look

11

into all questions of the adequacy of service of process.
And the Polizzi decision, I think, comes pretty close

12

13

to the question that you raised, that certainly there would be

14

no waiver by Mayacamas in that situation.
I think some of the colloquy about the trial setting,

15
16

one judge set its trail to effectuate the purposes of the

17

Georgia Priority Statute, and there was a certain lightness

18

about the colloquy, and Mr. Ward indicated that they were

19

trying to achieve a certain practical advantage in this

20

fashion.

21

Court used just a few years ago in the San Carlos Apache case

22

which I had mentioned earlier, that when you've got a Federal

23

Court proceeding on a parallel track with a State Court lawsuit

24

over the same issue, now I'm quoting, "it's an unseemly and

25

destructive race."

I'm simply motivated to cite the language that this

And I think it's that very spectacle even

though it can be, I think, made light of in some fashion, if

Heritage

37
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

you look at it that way, that this Court held is something

2

that's very disfavored as a matter of federalism.
I think that that same concern was expressed by the

3
4

framers in the debates that I cited in my brief.

5

same concern about avoiding Federal court\State court tensions

6

in litigation of this kind has been cited with concern over and

7

over again by this Court, most recently in the Pennzoil Texaco

8

case in a different context of younger abstention.

9

once again, you talk about the premise upon which basis our

I think that

But there

10

federal system was established, that the Federal courts are not

11

to gratuitously intervene in situations where it would put

12

itself into a posture of this very kind of conflict and

13

potential tension with the State court.

14

With respect, my opponent belittles those concerns

15

about Federal and state relationships as something that, and

16

I'm quoting, "of dubious relevance" in today's world of modern

17

interstate commerce, as if this nation had no further reason to

18

be concerned about conflicts between the national courts and

19

the state courts.

20

notion.

21

With respect, I think that's a striking

I think this case can be seen as just perhaps a

22

garden variety procedural dispute and so forth, but I think

23

with removal, it implicates a very fundamental Federal concern.

24

Thank you for your attention.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, Mr. Bien.
