CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We will hear argument next

Mr. Odle, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES N. ODLE, ESQUIRE

7

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

8

9
10

MR. ODLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
Most people that I know would not buy a stamp if they

11

could get their letters delivered without one.

12

about whether a labor Union can get its letter delivered across

13

postal routes without a stamp.

14

This case is

The United States Postal Service does not think so.

15

Neither does the University of California.

16

is the California Public Employment Relations Board, and the

17

California Court of Appeal, have found that California law

18

requires the University to deliver that letter.

19

But the PERB, that

The Federal body of law known as the Private Express

20

Statutes generally prohibits delivery of mail in competition

21

with the Postal Service.

22

PERB argues that two exceptions apply here.

These

23

are the letters of the carrier exception and the private hands

24

without compensation exception.

25

This is a technical case, in that it turns on careful

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

4

1

reading of those exceptions.

2

it is an important one, because there are millions of dollars

3

of Postal Service revenue at stake here.

4
5

QUESTION:

Isn't it going to cost the University some

money either way?
MR. ODLE:

6
7

But while it is a technical case,

It will cost the University perhaps some

money in that there may be more letters sent.

8

QUESTION:

But it will cost the Postal Service, is

MR. ODLE:

It will cost the Postal Service a lot of

12

QUESTION:

Thanks.

13

QUESTION:

Of course, it will also save them a lot of

9

that it?

10
11

14

money.

work, too, won't it?

15

MR. ODLE:

It will not save them very much, actually.

16

QUESTION:

It will save all the work involved in

17

delivering this mail from where it is given to your client to

18

deliver to the Union people, won't it?

19

QUESTION:

And if they are losing money on delivery

20

now so that they need postal rate increases, they will actually

21

be better off.

22

MR. ODLE:

Justice Scalia, I don't think they are

23

losing money on this kind of delivery.

There is a single

24

postal rate whether you send a letter from Maine to California

25

or across Berkeley.

And this is mail sent, the letters in this

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

628-4888

5
1

case would have been sent from a location in the City of

2

Berkeley to the University in Berkeley, and it probably would

3

not have 22 cents a letter to deliver those.

4
5
6

QUESTION:

I thought they were delivered throughout

the University system?
MR. ODLE:

Are all the deliveries in Berkeley?

The case arose over deliveries in

7

Berkeley, but I think that you are right, Justice Stevens, that

8

at stake here is a larger mail system.

9
10

QUESTION:

It is a big State and there are a lot of

branches of the University.

11

MR. ODLE:

That is right.

12

QUESTION:

Will how we decide this case help me to

13

get my mail faster?

14

MR. ODLE:

Yes, it will, Justice Marshall.

15

QUESTION:

Do you really think so?

16

MR. ODLE:

I do.

Or at least, I take that back, it

17

may, what it may do is make your mail slower.

18

will make it faster.

19

I doubt that it

The amici, in this case, by their own account,

20

represent some 3,500,000 employees, to whom they are eager to

21

deliver unstamped letters.

22

QUESTION:

3,500,000 employees of what?

23

MR. ODLE:

These are employees of employers across

24
25

the country.
QUESTION:

Oh, I see.

Heritage

I see.

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

6

1

MR. ODLE:

The Union represents those employees.

2

QUESTION:

Employers who would be in the position of

3

the University?

4

MR. ODLE:

I believe so.

5

QUESTION:

Yes.

6

MR. ODLE:

It has to be recognized that if the Postal

7

Service loses the revenue from those letters, other patrons of

8

the Postal Service are going to have to pay for it, either in

9

lower quality of service or in higher rates.
And, Justice Marshall, I would suggest that you would

10
11

pay for it in lower quality of service.

12

Let me talk about the two exceptions.

13

The letters of the carrier exception is the exceptio

14

that allows the University to deliver its own letters without a

15

stamp.

16

The language of that exception and the legislative

17

history of it I think have been very thoroughly briefed.

18

think it is clear that the exception applies to letters sent by

19

or addressed to the carrier -- in this case, the University.

We

20

QUESTION:

You think it is clear from the language?

21

MR. ODLE:

I think it is very clear from the language

22
23

of the regulation, Justice Scalia.
QUESTION:

Let's talk about the regulation.

You urge

24

that we must give deference to the regulation.

25

deference to the regulations of agencies that are charged with

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

We give

7

1
2

the administration of particular schemes.
But it seems to me that the Post Office is not

3

charged with administration of this law prohibiting persons

4

other than the Post Office from carrying mail.

5

saying that the Attorney General is charged with administration

6

of the criminal laws so we should defer to the prosecutor's

7

determination of what a criminal law means.

8
9

That is like

You are not administering this statute at all.
would be very strange to say you are administering it.

It
To the

10

contrary, you are the chief competitor of those who are trying

11

to avoid the statute.

12

Why should we give you deference?

13

MR. ODLE:

It is certainly true that the Postal

14

Service is the chief competitor of those who would deliver it

15

in competition with the Postal Service.

16

The Postal Service, however, it seems to me, does

17

administer the statute, in fact.

18

for example, to suspend the operation of the statute in what

19

the Postal Service considers to be appropriate cases.

20

writes suspensions of the statute which specifically enable

21

others to deliver letters which the Postal Service would

22

otherwise deliver itself.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

It is authorized by Congress,

And it

What provision is that that enables them

to do that?
MR. ODLE:

I can point you to the Code of Federal

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

8
1

Regulations sections in which the suspensions are written.

The

2

legislation is in Section 601.

3

the operation of any part of this section upon any mail route

4

where the public interest requires the suspension.

5

That is Section 601, 39 U.S.C.

6

QUESTION:

Thank you.

7

MR. ODLE:

The letters of the carrier regulation

The Postal Service may suspend

8

provides that the sending or carrying of letters is permissible

9

if they are sent by or addressed to the person carrying them.

10

Now, the regulations recognize that "person" for this

11

purpose may be an institution.

12

recognize that when a letter is sent by or addressed to an

13

institution it is going to have to be carried by some

14

individual.

15

"If the individual actually carrying the letters is not the

16

person sending the letters or to whom the letters are

17

addressed, then such individual must be an officer or employee

18

of such person."

19

And the regulations also

So the regulation provides, and I am reading here:

In other words, the individual who actually carries

20

the letter must be an officer or employe of the institution

21

sending them or to whom they are addressed.

22

23
24
25

Now, the person carrying these letters is an employe
of the University.
When a third party, like a Union, sends a letter, the
sender is the third party.

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

9

1
2

So the issue is, is the University the receiver of
that letter?

3

And the answer is, it depends.

4

If the letter is sent to someone who receives it as

5

an agent for the University, who receives it on behalf of the

6

University, it makes sense to call that a letter to the

7

University.

8
9

10
11

If the person who receives that letter doesn't
receive it as an agent of the University, but receives it on
his own behalf, it is not a letter to the University.
For example, if, as the University's lawyer, if I

12

receive a letter from the Union about this case, I receive that

13

letter on behalf of the University and it is a letter to the

14

University.

15

If I receive a letter from a Union saying Mr. Odle,

16

we think you ought to join the Union and authorize it to

17

bargain on your behalf with the University and try to get you a

18

higher wage and maybe strike against the University if you

19

don't get it, that is not a letter to the University.

20

a letter to me.

21

QUESTION:

That is

Mr. Odle, I thought that the State

22

legislature in California has determined that providing Unions

23

access to the internal mail of the mail system is the current

24

business of the University, or has made some effort

25

legislatively to say that it is defining the business of the

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

10
1

university as including this.

2

Now, what do we do with that?

3

MR. ODLE:

4

regulation states a two-part test.
The letter must relate to the current business of the

5
6

Well, you realize first that the

University and it must be to or from the University.

7

QUESTION:

Well, of course, the statute itself,

8

Section 1694, refers to, as the exception, except such as

9

relates to the current business of the carrier.
MR. ODLE:

10

That is right.

And I believe that the

11

intent in enacting that statute in 1909, as we have argued in

12

the brief, was to codify an Opinion of the Attorney General

13

dated 1896.
QUESTION:

14

Is that your interpretation of the

15

regulation and the validity of it?

You would not fall within

16

the letters of the carrier exception?

17

regulation totally, I gather.

18

MR. ODLE:

You depend on the

I think we would if we read the statute

19

properly.

20

fall outside of the intent of the statute, if that is your

21

question.

22

I think that we would fall, that these letters would

I think that because the Attorney General's Opinion

23

which preceded the statute is very clear and I think the

24

legislative history is very clear that what Congress meant was

25

to embody that opinion in the statute.

Heritage

And there is another

11

1

Attorney General's Opinion a year later,in 1910, which says

2

thatthat is what

3

that law has been on the books in that form ever since.

4

Congress meant and that is what it did.

QUESTION:

And

It would have been so easy to say that,

5

though.

6

addressed to or from a business and relating to its business.

7

It is not as though it is

8

they meant.

9

it has to relate to the business.

10

It would have been so easy to say except letters

They

MR. ODLE:

difficult to describe what you say

They just said

That is true, Justice Scalia.

And I don't

11

know why they did not put it that way.

13

instrumental in promoting the 1909 legislation, that it would i

14

fact embody the Attorney General's Opinion.

16

into that detail, I don't

know.

read this phrase, relates

to the current business, in a

18

somewhat narrower way than it could be read.

19

not sure.

20

I think they felt that they

Why that is, I am

As further evidence that the letter is not a letter

21

to the University, if more evidence of that is needed, it seems

22

pretty clear that it would violate California labor law for the

23

University to read that letter, just as it would violate

24

Federal law for an employer covered by the National Labor

25

Relations Act, to read such a letter from a Union to the

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

12
1
2

employee.
PERB argues that if the letters of the carrier

3

exception doesn't apply, the private hands without compensation

4

exception does.

5

The problem with that is that the University is

6

compensated.

7

which pays for the operation of the mail system.

8

California Legislature is also the entity that has ordered us

9

to deliver the mail.

10

We receive money from the California Legislature
And the

It just offends common sense to say that mail which

11

is ordered and paid for by the same entity is not compensated.

12

PERB argues that the intent is the key here, that if

13

the intent is to compete, the exception does not apply but if

14

there is another intent, it may apply.

15

The problem is that the California intent here, the

16

Legislature's intent, is clearly to withhold revenue from the

17

Postal Service.

18

but to facilitate it in just one way — by making it cheaper.

19

It is sophistry to say that the Legislature intends

20

to save significant dollars for the Unions but doesn't intend

21

to withhold significant dollars from the Postal Service when

22

they are the very same dollars.

23

The purpose is to facilitate communication,

Anyone setting up to compete with the Postal Service

24

on more economical routes like these could claim to be

25

facilitating communication by making it cheaper.

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
628-4888

(202)

The problem

13

1

is that there has been a national decision, there should be a

2

national postal rate, there should be a Postal Service to

3

accomplish that.

4

to say you cannot compete with it unless you fall under one of

5

the exceptions.
Those exceptions are to be made by Congress, not by

6

7

the California Legislature.
QUESTION:

8

9

And to preserve that service, it is necessary

Counsel, it is still not clear to me how

many people use this system.
MR. ODLE:

10

The University of California has about

11

100,000 employees.

12

That is, mail sent to or from the University of California

13

employees.
QUESTION:

14
15

We use the system to deliver our own mail.

What if a professor wants to send a letter

to another professor down the hall?
MR. ODLE:

16

If it is down the hall, he probably

17

carries it.

He may send it through the University's mail

18

system.

19

to cross a Postal Route to be subject to these laws.

It may not be involved with these laws, because it has

QUESTION:

20

It can be mailed by the same system.

21

do you draw the line between the professor and the other

22

people?

23

MR. ODLE:

Why

Because if the professor's letter is sent

24

to another university employee on the business, that is, as a

25

representative of the University, it is a letter to the

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

14
1

University.

2

The problem is that the Union letters are not.

3

QUESTION:

If a professor is writing to another

4

professor about a third professor at Harvard, that involves the

5

University?
MR. ODLE:

6
7

if I may just take a moment to answer.
QUESTION:

8
9

I would say it depends, Justice Marshall,

Because if you take Harvard, I'm going to

go to Oxford.
MR. ODLE:

10

Let us suppose that the professor at

11

Harvard has applied for a job, and one professor writes to

12

another and says he is good, I think you ought to hire him.

13

That would be a letter to the University.

14

On the other hand --

15

QUESTION:

16
17

business?

What if he asks him how about his Union

What does he think of his Union?
MR. ODLE:

I don't think that would be a letter to

18

the University and I don't think it could be carried by the

19

University.

20

QUESTION:

This is to another professor?

21

MR. ODLE:

That's right.

22

QUESTION:

I am writing to you to find out how is Joe

23
24
25

Droke's standing with the Union.
MR. ODLE:

Unless you wanted to know that in order to

conduct University business, your letter would not be a letter

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

15
1

of the University.

You could write to that other professor

2

asking him if he wants to join you for Halloween, and that

3

would not be a letter of the University.

4

QUESTION:

Isn't it?

Isn't that University business?

5

MR. ODLE:

I think the answer to that is more

6

complicated than yes or no.

Certainly, collective bargaining

7

is the University's business in the sense that we engage in it,

8

we hire people to do it, and if there is a letter from our

9

collective bargainer, to the President of the University, about

10

Union negotiations, that is certainly a letter of the

11

University.
But the issue here is, if there is a letter from the

12

13

Union encouraging an employee to join the Union, is that a

14

letter to the University?

17

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. WRIGHT, ESQUIRE

18

AS AMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF APPELLANT
MR. WRIGHT:

19

20

We

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Broad constructions of the private express statutes

21
22

like the decision of the Court of Appeal below do reduce the

23

scope of the Postal monopoly and threaten to reduce Postal

24

revenues.

25

As Mr. Odle said, the fact that three and a half

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

16

1

million employees are represented by the amici in this case

2

shows that a substantial amount of mail could be diverted from

3

the Postal Service.

4

QUESTION:

5
6

7
8
9
10

Mr. Wright, what authority does the Postal

Service have to issue this regulation?
MR. WRIGHT:

Section 401, 39 U.S.C. 401, which is

quoted in a footnote on Page 23 of our brief.
QUESTION:

So you think that authority to issue that

regulation entitles the Postal Service interpretation of the
statute to some deference?

11

MR. WRIGHT:

I certainly do.

12

The statute says that the Postal Service has

13

authority to adopt, amend, and repeal such rules and

14

regulations as it deems necessary to accomplish the objectives

15

of this title, which include the private express statutes.

16
17
18

Congress has quite clearly given the Postal Service
authority to define what these statutes mean.
It is true that the Postal Service is also the

19

beneficiary of this statute. I take that to mean that Congress

20

would not expect the most liberal interpretation of the

21

statute. It would expect the contrary.

22

QUESTION:

How long has the Postal Service

23

interpreted this Act that way?

24

MR. WRIGHT:

25

Yes.

Forever?

In turning to the letters of the

carrier exception, this is a classic case of deference.

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

This

17
1

is a long standing interpretation that was originally

2

formulated contemporaneously with the relevant statutory

3

amendment which was in 1909, and it has been consistently

4

followed ever since.
I would like to go through that briefly, the

5
6

legislative history.

7

First, let me note, the words of the statute are

8

ambiguous.

9

has done it.

10

It could be construed the way the Postal Service
It could be construed the way the Court of

Appeals has done it.
I would say that the issue here is whether letters to

11
12

institutions can only be sent to their representatives.

That

13

is the way the Postal Service has construed it, and the issue

14

is whether they have properly done so.
I would think that the language of the statute

15
16

letters relating to the current business of the carrier would

17

normally be sent to representatives, would not be sent to

18

someone else in the case of an institution.
It is true that you can define the business of

19
20

something like a university very broadly and include almost

21

everything, including the letters here.
So I start with the proposition that the language is

22

23
24
25

ambiguous.
But this is a case where the legislative history is
very, very clear.

In the 1896 Attorney General Opinion letter

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

18

1

that was referred to, the Attorney General concluded, despite

2

the lack of a basis in the language of the private express

3

statutes at that time, that a railroad could carry its own

4

letters.

5

He said that the right he identified was quote:

6

"...to carry letters written and sent by the officers and

7

agents of the railroad company which carries and delivers them,

8

about its business, and these only."

9

He added that:

Unquote.

"...companies could not carry letters

10

that are neither written by that company nor addressed to it."

11

Unquote.
IN 1909, when Congress added the language at issue

12

13

here, the principal proponent of the amendment was Senator

14

Bacon.

15

language what the Attorney General says it means.

And he wanted to revise the statute to express in exact

16

The Senator who actually proposed the language of the

17

amendment was Senator Sutherland, and he said that that was its

18

purpose.

Congressional Record at that time said that it put the statute

quote:

QUESTION:

Mr. Wright, educate me, because I speak

from ignorance.
In the last decade or so, we have seen a

6

proliferation of Federal Express and Emory and all these other

7

overnight carriers.

8

Do they operate under some special statute?

9

MR. WRIGHT:

Yes.

The Postal Service is also

10

authorized to suspend the operation of the statutes where the

11

public interest so requires.

12

In 1979, it did so for extremely urgent letters which

13

are defined in the regulations basically to be letters that

14

cost a certain multiple of normal postage.

15

regulatory suspension under which Federal Express operates.

18

QUESTION:

It is a

It seems to me that this is devastating

competition to the Postal Service.
MR. WRIGHT:

The legislative history of the 1979

19

amendment — we cited the hearings in our brief -- the Postal

20

Service adopted that suspension somewhat reluctantly.

21

it is fair to say that Congress would have enacted it

22

statutorily if the Postal Service had not come up with a

23

regulation.

24
25

I think

But it did and that solved the problem.

PERB suggests that its interpretation of the private
express statute warrants deference.

Heritage

We think that that is

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

20
1

plainly wrong.

2

that says that Unions can use -- the California statute says

3

that Unions can use -- the means of communication of employers.

4

PERB has construed that to mean internal mail systems.

5
6

Its interpretation of the California statute

We have not quarreled with that.

That is entitled to

deference.

7

But Congress gave the Postal Service, in

8

401, the authority to construe the private express statutes.

9

It didn't give that authority to PERB.

10

Section

I would like to turn to the other exception that PERB

11

says authorizes the deliver here, the private hands without

12

compensation exception.

13

This is another long standing exception.

The precise

14

language dates back to 1845, the private hands without

15

compensation.

16

In 1846, a District Court stated that a deliverer of

17

merchandise could not also deliver letters even though it did

18

not make any separate charge for the delivery.

19

Service has followed that interpretation ever since.

20

And the Postal

More recently, in the 1970s, a number of cases came

21

up involving school districts who wanted to deliver Union

22

letters, very similar cases to this one.

23

In some of these cases, collective bargaining

24

agreements spelled out a duty to carry the Union's letters. IN

25

those cases, I think it is clear beyond doubt, and I do not

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

understand PERB to disagree, that compensation was involved.

As the prior case demonstrates, employers and Unions
are in an adversarial relationship.

this case?

MR. WRIGHT:

First, this is all part of a bargain under which the
employees give their labor to the University.

There are three different kinds of

compensation here.

Mr. Wright, what is the compensation in

But it is a statutory requirement, isn't

it, that they do this?
MR. WRIGHT:

12

If there was a statutory requirement

13

that the University's dental school give free service to Union

14

employees, or just employees of the University, I do not think

15

there would be any question that that would arise out of the

16

employment relationship, and the compensation to the University

17

of the employees' labor was compensation whether or not it was

18

statutory or contractual.
QUESTION:

19
20

Tell me again, what is the compensation to

the University for doing this?
MR. WRIGHT:

21

Three things.

Our first argument is

22

that it is the labor of the employees, and their agent, the

23

employees' agent, the Union, gets to send these letters.

I mean, I can understand the theory of what you are

This is a unique case, because the State

has ordered the carrying.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. WRIGHT:

Yes.
Second, the fact is that the State is

10

the employer here, and it is just like the school district

11

cases, in our view, except that the Unions go and negotiate

12

with the legislature rather than directly with the University.

13

They've gone up a step.

14
15

We think that that is clear, if you look at the next
case.

16

QUESTION:

I still don't understand.

What I am

asking is, what is the compensation?

compensation is the services of the employees who receive the

mail.

17

the same thing for me a week from now on the return trip, then

18

they have to pay postage?

19

MR. WRIGHT:

We would say there is compensation here.

20

As it happens, the special messenger exception to the private

21

express statutes would cover that, in any other case where he

22

was handling fewer than 25 letters.

would be compensation.

Now, what is your third compensation?

MR. WRIGHT:

The third case is, PERB says we're

2

wrong.

3

The State and the University are different.

4

It says you are wrong to say the State is the employer.

But if that is true, then it is even more clear that

5

it is compensation, that there is compensation here, because

the University is both ordering them to carry mail and paying

for it, because it funds the University.

QUESTION:

I take it there is always some expense to

the private carrier making the delivery.

The fact that he has

to pay his own bills cannot make it.
MR. WRIGHT:

But it is different if the person

ordering it also pays for it.
If I ask you to deliver a letter and give you money

14

to do it, even if it is a letter from someone else and being

15

received by someone else, even if it is not my letter, if I am

16

both telling you to pay for it and paying you to do so, I am

17

compensating you for that.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Wright, may I inguire whether you

19

think we owe the same degree of deference to an agency's

20

interpretation or construction of a statute by regulation if

21

the effect of it is to pre-empt State law?

22

MR. WRIGHT:

23

I would like to make one other point.

Yes, we think so.
PERB has also

24

argued that the Postal Service has not been consistent in its

25

application of these statutes, relying on an Indianapolis cased

Heritage

where the Postal Service said that a school district could

carry letters from a community service group to students about

compensation there.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:

14

The question here is whether California's strong

communication between employees and their representatives as

17

codified in HEERA can be harmonized with the private express

18

statutes.

The State has determined that the University of

20

California has a statutory duty to allow employee organizations

21

to carry this mail to employees in order to make the HEERA

22

scheme of cooperative labor relations effective.

23

The private express statutes, we submit, can be

24

harmonized with the State law by using either one of the two

25

exceptions that have been discussed this afternoon, the

Heritage

Reporting

business of the carrier exception or the private hands without

2

compensation exception.
Postage foregone under one of these exceptions is

3
4

postage forgone pursuant to Congressional design.

5

QUESTION:

Ms. Biren, let me ask you.

Supposing if

6

the 3,500,000 were filing an amicus brief here all succeed in

7

getting what you say the University of California employees

8

get, do you think that would be pursuant to Congressional

9

design?
MS. BIREN:

10

First of all, I think it is not the least

11

bit clear that all 3,500,000 of them would be covered under a

12

decision in our favor in this case.

13

We have relied substantially on a specific statute

14

here, HEERA, which really sets up a very cooperative labor

15

relations scheme in which the employees are supposed to be

16

allowed the fullest participation possible through their

17

employee organizations in the determinations of conditions of

18

employment, and there is an access statute which specifically

19

says that these employees can hear from their employee

20

organizations through the mail system.
That is not the case in many states represented by

21
22

23
24
25

amici.
QUESTION:

What difference does that make in

interpreting the provisions here?

For several reasons.

First, I think —

QUESTION:

12

MS. BIREN:

But in terms of the regulation.
In terms of the regulation, that is what

13

I am going to talk about.

14

labor relations scheme in which the employees are part of the

15

decision making on something that is patently the business of

16

the carrier — the terms and conditions of employment of the

17

employees.

18
19
20

As I said, here is a cooperative

Through their representatives, they participate in
bargaining over this.
Therefore, as to this particular business of the

21

University — labor relations, the determination of terms and

22

conditions of employment — these employees are equal partners

23

in that decision making, and their representatives, therefore,

24

are their agents.

25

stretching it, but I think in a broader view, if you insisted

They are their agents.

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

And I think it is

Corporation

628-4888

28
1

upon the agency concept, which I do not think is present in

2

either the statute or the regulation, you could say that they

3

are the agents of the University as a whole in fulfilling its

4

total duty under HEERA to allow employees to participate to the

5

fullest extent in the labor relations scheme.
I have made one of the points I wanted to make,

6

7

regarding carriage, at issue here, being within the statute and

8

the regulation, because of the carrier's business.

9

The other point that I would go into at more length

10

is under the private hands without compensation exception, to

11

show that the University is not private hands, because it is

12

not the Postal Service, and there is no compensation for

13

carriage because compensation has traditionally been

14

interpreted as money, identifiable goods or services, and

15

lately, since 1976, good will, flowing between the user and the

16

carrier.

17

State funding does not meet that description.

State

18

funding is not compensation, within the intent of Congress when

19

it passed the private hands without compensation exception.

20

QUESTION:

When you say State funding, I mean, did

21

the California legislature appropriate money to the University

22

of California to perform these services?

23

MS. BIREN:

The State of California appropriates

24

money to fund the mail system.

25

It did before this order existed and there is no showing in the

Heritage

It did before HEERA existed.

(202) 628-4888

record that there is any relationship between the order to

2

carry this mail and the type of funding they received for the

3

mail system.
QUESTION:

4

So far as you can see, the University will

5

get the same line item, if it is a line item, for carrying

6

mail, even after this as before?

7

MS. BIREN:

To the extent that the record deals with

8

this matter, that seems to be the case.

9

that made any difference.

10

QUESTION:

11

MS. BIREN:

12

QUESTION:

13

The line item meaning what?

100 percent?

Right.
100 percent of whatever mail they carry

gets paid for by the State.

14

MS. BIREN:

15

QUESTION:

That's right.
The State has told them to carry the mail

16

and the State is going to pay for 100 percent of the carriage.

17

Bingo.

QUESTION:

4

Do you have any cases that are even close

to this case?

5

No.

Well, the only thing that is close

6

is the Advisory Opinion in 77(a) which allows the Indianapolis

7

School Board to carry the circular.

system is no different than the compensation here.

Obviously, in terms of the

the Government funds it.

But

13

Just following that through, staying with the private

15

16

it as pumped up to include the payment for the carriage of

Ex Parte Jackson, talked

19

about the purpose of the Postal monopoly as being to prohibit

20

carriage for hire.

22

23

In 1896, the Attorney General's Opinion talked about
traded services between railroads.
And in 1908, in the discussions in Congress about the

24

business of the carrier exception, they talked about their

25

understanding of the Postal monopoly, which was to prevent

Heritage

Reporting Corporation

3

Again, the intent of Congress here was to avoid
entrepreneurial competition with the Postal Service.

3

to do this.

4
5

QUESTION:

I don't know whether they want to do it or

not, but I suppose they want to obey the Federal law, too.

6

MS. BIREN:

7

QUESTION:

They do, indeed.
What if the University had been convinced

8

that they could legally carry this and wanted to, but they just

9

happened to be wrong.

10
11
12

MS. BIREN:

It appears to me that what they do is

they inform them that they are carrying in error.
QUESTION:

14

here, haven't they?

15

MS. BIREN:

16

QUESTION:

18

Do

they sue somebody or what?

13

17

What does the Postal Service do?

And they have informed the University

They have.
So the University has some grounds for

saying, let's be careful.
MS. BIREN:

And that's why we're here.

Precisely.

19

But our contention is that these two statutory and regulatory

20

exceptions provide for this type of carriage, because in the

21

business of the carrier exception, to do otherwise, we submit,

22

would simply be irrational and as we have said with private

23

hands without compensation it would be inconsistent with the

24

previous interpretation.

25

Now, it may well be that Congress may wish to expand

10

11

Which regulation are we talking about?

MS. BIREN:

to receive mail in the labor relations situation, yes.

But what if we disagree with you on the

13

interpretation of the regulation?

MS. BIREN:

Would you then say it is

In this case, it was

And we believe that brings it within the

In the labor relations context, it would really be

7

unreasonable not to interpret it this way, because when you

8

talk about agency in terms of control of the employee response,

9

which the University has done in its brief, that is illegal in

10

the labor relations context.
And it is specifically illegal under the HEERA

11

12

scheme.
Rather, in this cooperative scheme, you have a

13
14

pluralistic university with many parts, and the employee part

15

has a role to play in decision making on terms and conditions

16

of employment.

17

In other words, there is a middle ground between an

18

identity of interest with management and a personal interest.

19

And that middle ground is the interest we find here, which is

20

of employees participating in the labor relations scheme

21

through their employee organizations.

So the distinctions I was pointing out were that it

that the employers are part of the components of the entity

QUESTION:

Making that argument, what if the State of

Would that be then part of the business of the

But I think it is important to realize that labor

relations holds a very special place and that it isn't the case

that it is likely for California to pass that type of law. I

did do a great deal of thinking about those types of laws, in

preparing for this argument.

realize that labor relations is a special subject and this

decision by the Legislature to foster these labor relations

puts this type of carrier in a special place.

And I think it is important to

And further, perhaps another distinction is that in

this statutory scheme, there is a special place for access,

that the facilitation of effective communication is

particularly important because of the problems in labor

relations that this Court knows about historically, of employee

to allow in public employment this type of mail system

communication between public employees and their organizations.
