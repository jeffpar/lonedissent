ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEITH A. JONES, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
HR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This cases involves a claim of sex discrimination
under the Social Security Act.
Section 202(G) of that Act provides for the
payments of benefits to certain widowed mothers.

There is

no comparable provision under the Act for payment of benefits
under the Act to widowed fathers.
The Appellee in this case is a widowed father
who claims that he is constitutionally entitled to payment
of benefits on the same basis as if he were a widowed mother.
It is the Government’s position, as I will elaborate
on at some length later, that this statute, like the property
tax exemption in favor of widows in Kahn against Shevln,
serves the permissible legislative objective of ameliorating
the harsh economic consequences of economic job discrimination
against women and that it should be sustained on that basis.
A description of the operation of the Act is

4
essential to the understanding of this case.
The benefits

payable under Section 202(G) are

paid out on account of the Social Security account of the
deceased wage earner.

The widowed mother receives equal to

three-quarters of the primary insurance benefit that the
deceased husband would have received had he lived and
retired, reduced 50 cents for each dollar that the widow
earns in excess of $2,400 per year.
Payments are made to the widowed mother so long as
she has a minor child in her care and remains unmarried.
Similar benefits are provided under the Act for the
child of a deceased wage earner.

The child receives benefits

on the basis of the Social Security account of his or her
deceased parent whether or not the parent is the father or
the mother.

It makes no difference.

But there is no provision under the Act for the
payment of benefits to widowed fathers under the age of 60 on
the basis of the account of their deceased wives.
The
widower.

Appellee in this case is a young, unemployed

After the death of his wife, his child began

receiving benefits based upon her Social Security account.
He, hox\rever was not entitled to

benefits.

By "he" I mean

the Appellee was not entitled to benefits himself under the
Act.
In view of this, he brought present suit for

declaratory and Injunctive relief, contending that he was
constitutionally entitled to a distribution of benefits on
the same basis as if he were a widow rather than a widower.
A three-judge court was convened.

The court

determined that all sex-based classifications are inherently
suspect under this Court's two-tiered Equal Protection
analysis that it has applied in recent years.
The court analyzed the statute, concluded that it
did not serve a compelling governmental interest and,
accordingly, the court held the statute unconstitutional
and ordered the payment of benefits to the Appellee as if
he were a widow.
The court stayed its order pending this appeal and
the case is now here on the Government's direct appeal.
At the outset, I think it can be said that the
District Court clearly erred in applying the compelling;
governmental interest standard of review.
It has become clear in this Court's decision in
Kahn against Sheyin and, last week, in Schlesinger against
Ballard, that sex-based classifications are not inherently
suspect.

They are not subject to justification only on the

basis of a so-called "governmental interest."

They are not

invalid per se.
This is not to suggest that the traditional
permissive rational basis standard of review is fully

6
appropriate in all sex discrimination cases.
Sex-based classifications, we believe, do merit
close

judicial scrutiny and they have received it by this

Court in the past.
In Frontiero against Richardson and Reed against
Reed, this Court struck down sex classifications that merely
served the purpose of administrative convenience.

Thus the

Court has applied a standard of review which involves close
scrutiny, but scrutiny which is not so strict as to be
inevitably fatal.
The rule that the Court seems to be applying is
simply that sex-based

classifications must rest on some

substantial reasonable basis

or, as Chief Justice Burger

said in the Reed opinion, upon some ground of difference
having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the
legislation.
As I will now show, the statute here in question
easily meets that test.
Appellee’s principal attack on this statute is,
curiously enough, not from the point of View of the widower
who has been denied benefits, but rather from the point of
view of the female wage earner who, it is alleged, is denied
Social Security coverage for her spouse that would have been
granted to a male wage earner.
The Appellee’s argument proceeds syllogistically.

7
First, the Appellee analogizes the payment of
Social Security taxes to the purchase of private insurance
coverage.

Then the Appellee contends that female wage

earners are not granted the right to purchase the same
insurance coverage that a male wage earner purchases for
his spouse under the system and, Appellee concludes, that is
discrepancy in treatment, is a discrepancy in insurance
coverage, it is impermissible.
We believe there are two fatal flaws to this
chain of reasoning.

First, the analogy to private insurance

schemes is itself fundamentally

erroneous.

As this Court noted in Flemming against Nestor,
the Social Security Act comprehends a scheme, not of private
but of social insurance under which benefits are distributed
and coverage provided,

in large part, under the basis of

probable need rather than on the basis of strict — rather
than strictly on the basis of the contributions that the
insured wage earner has paid.
Even accepting, for the moment, the private
insurer paradigm on which Appellee relies, we think it is
nevertheless clear that the female wage earner is not
entitled to any additional insurance coverage under the Act,
that the female wage earner has not been disadvantaged in
any way.
As we pointed out on pages 21 and 22 of our brief,

8
female wage earners, under the Social Security system, pay in
only 28 percent of all Social Security taxes whereas 3^
percent of the benefits paid out of the system are paid out
on the basis of the Social Security account of female wageearners .
Now, I am not tslicing about the benefits that are
paid to women.

I am talking about the benefits that are

paid out solely on the basis of the women's accounts as
workers.
Now, this means that the Social Security system is
already out of actuarial balance in favor of the female
wage earner as against the male wage earner.
If my rough arithmetical calculations are correct,
right now, the female wage earner

receives 33 percent

greater coverage under the Act in terms of dollars than
does the male wage earner.
To grant the additional insurance coverage for
which Appellee contends here would simply further tilt the
scales in favor of the female wage earner as against her
male counterpart.
QUESTION:

How do you account for the existing

disparity?
MR. JONES:

I think, in large part, the disparity

flows from the fact that women have longer life expectancies
and that their retirement benefits are spread out over a

9
longer period of time.
It may also be attributal in part to the fact that
lower wage earners are entitled to somewhat greater return
under the Act than are higher wage earners and women,
statistically, are lower wage earners.
I think for those two reasons, and I’m not sure
which is more important, women do receive, on the basis of
their accounts, far greater return than do men.
And our position with respect to this argument,
this insurance coverage argument by the Appellee, is that
to grant further coverage, to further tilt the scales in
favor of women, obviously would not serve the purposes of
the Equal Protection Clause and it therefore seems to us
that Appellee's insurance coverage argument simply reduces
to the complaint that Appellee’s individual wife, as a wage
earner, unlike the average female wage earner, has been
somehow disadvantaged, that the payments made on the basis
of her account are in some sense constitutionally insuffi­
cient .
Nov/, there is no merit to this argument, either
legally or factually.
As a factual matter, I think that you can deduce
from the record, and it is clear, that Appellee's son has
already, or will soon have, received greater benefits under
the Social Security Act, than his wife ever paid into the

10

system* that there is no ground for viewing her account as
being somehow disadvantaged.
But* more fundamentally, as a legal matter, there is
no basis for an argument that a Social Security contributor
has a vested interest in his or her Social Security account.
That argument, which obviously is not a sex
discrimination argument, was firmly rejected by this

Court

in Flemming against Nestor, in language which I think is
equally appropriate here and I would like to quote:
nThe Social Security system may be accurately
described as a form of social insurance whereby persons
gainfully employed and those who employ them are taxe'd for
the payment of benefits to the retired and disabled and their
dependents.

The noncontractual interest of an employee

covered by the Act cannot be soundly analogized to that of
a holder of an annuity whose right to benefits is bottomed
on his contractual premium payments.’’
We therefore think it is clear that Appellee's
wife, as a female wage earner, was not disadvantaged, either
in her individual capacity or as a member of a class under
the Act, that she was not the subject -- was not the victim
of any cognizable discrimination under the Act.
i'or that reason, I now turn to the Appellee’s
alternative argument, which is based upon the contention
that the denial of benefits to a widower constitutes a denial

11
of Equal Protection to men as an impermissible discrimination
against men.
That argument, it seems to us, is foreclosed by
this Court’s decision in
this Court upheld

Kalin against Shevin.

In that case,

a special Florida property tax

exemption that was granted only to widows and not to widowers.
The objective of that legislation, like that of
the statute here, was to ameliorate in some degree the
economic difficulties that uniquely confront the lone woman
who has lost her husband.
The Court, in that opinion, recited statistics
showing that the average female worker earned approximately
40 percent of the income of the average male worker and
the Court noted that this disparity in the economic eapabil_
ities would be exascerbated in the case of a widow vis-a-vis
a widower and that the difference in earning power between a
widow and widower was probably even greater than that
between women and men generally.
Mr. Justice Douglas, writing for the Court in that
case, observed that while the widower can usually continue
in his occupation, in many cases the widow will suddenly
find herself forced into a job market with which she is
unfamiliar and in which, because of her former economic
dependency, she will have fewer skills to offer.
And it is also clear that the discrimination

12
inherent in such a statute between widows and widowers is
rot impermissible.
As Mr. Justice Brennan, who is dissenting on other
grounds in that case, observed, it is permissible to
distinguish between widows and widowers because only the
former and not the latter are subject to discrimination as
a class and, if I may quote again from the dissenting
opinion, "Inclusion of needy widowers would not further the
state’s overriding interest in remedying the economic effects
past sex discrimination for needy victims of that discrim­
ination. "
Well, doubtless some widowers are in financial
need.

No one suggests that such need results from sex

discrimination.
On the basis of these considerations, the Coui’t in
this case, Kahn against Shevin, upheld the Florida statute
as resting upon some ground of difference having a fair and
substantial relation to the object of the legislation.
Well, precisely the same considerations govern
this case.
Congress recognized that the probable need of
widows is greater than that of widowers and it enacted
Section 202(G) to provide for that need.
In doing so, Congress merely acted as it had also
donein behalf of other persons, such as aged, dependent

13
parents who cannot be fairly expected to replace, by their
own efforts in the job market, the loss of support that has
been occasioned by the death of a family wage earner.
Moreover,

this provision. Section 202(G), does

not suffer from the vice of overinclusiveness that led two
Justices of this Court to dissent from the ruling in Kahn.
The amount of the benefits payable under Section
202(G) is inversely correlated, to the amount of the widow’s
earnings so that the woman who has, in fact, successfully
surmounted sexual

job discrimination is not provided

benefits under this Act.
Similarly, benefits are provided only to the widow
with a minor child in her care for whom the economic con­
sequences of job discrimination are heightened by the fact
that she must additionally provide competent child care
during the working hours.
At the same time the benefits provided under this
statute are considerably more substantial than those that
were granted by the property tax exemption in Kahn.
Therefore, it seems clear to us that Section 202(G)
serves the permissible legislative objective of ameliorating
the economic consequences of employment discrimination that
widows with children suffer with heightened severity and
that it does so both more thoroughly and more carefully
than did the statute in Kahn against Shevin.

14
I would add at this point only one final point:
At bottom, the Appellee’s argument here is that
benefits under the Social Security Act must be distributed
without regard to sex, equally to men and women in

all cases.

Although we realize that program costs cannot be
determinative in a case such as this, we feel that it is
nevertheless not without some significance that the cost of
achieving this objective, of paying out all benefits without
regard to sex, would be approximately $350 million additional
per year.

The statistics are set forth on page 15 of the

Appendix.
Tills additional money would have to come from
somewhere.

The Social Security system is supposed to remain

in actuarial balance.

Therefore, to pay out these additional

benefits,either Social Security taxes would have to be
increased or some other benefit group — or the benefits
payable to some other group would have to be reduced.
It is in this context that we feel that this Court’s
statement in Dandrldge against Williams is particularly
appropriate.

That is, that it does not sit to second-guess

officials charged with the difficult responsibility of
allocating scarce public welfare funds among the myriad of
potential recipients.
Now, to apply a judicial restraint of this kind in
a case like this is not, however, to place the Social Security

15
system in the iron grip of the status quo.
Congress has recently

considered sex-based

classifications under the Act and it has amended the statute
to eliminate one of the major sex-based classifications by
providing for the equalization of the method of computing
retirement benefits for men and women and it may well act to
further reduce or ultimately entirely eliminate all sex
classifications under the Act.
But for the present, we feel that it is clear that
the exclusion of widowers under Section 202(G) lies well
within Congress' constitutional power to allocate welfare
funds.
For these reasons, we respectfully submit that the
judgment below should be reversed,

I don’t think that there are any more that remain.
Well, on age exclusively.

Now, there are some

provisions that discriminate between men and women on the

cases be entitled to benefits, whereas a widow might be

entitled to benefits at an earlier age.

Mrs. Ginsburg.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. RUTH BADER GINSBURG
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE
MRS. GINSBURG:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
Stephen Wiesenfeld's case concerns the

entitlement

of a female wage earner — a female wage earner's family to
social insurance of the same quality as that accorded a
family of

a

male wage earner.

Four prime facts of the Wiesenfeld family's life
situation bear special emphasis.
Paula Wiesenfeld, the deceased insured worker,
was gainfully employed at all times during the seven years
immediately preceding her death.

Throughout this period the

20

maximum contributions were deducted from her salary and paid
to Social Security.
During Paula’s marriage to Stephen Wiesenfeld,
both were employed.

Neither was attending school.

And

Paula was the family’s principal income earner.
In 1972, Paula died giving birth to her son, Jason
Paul, leaving the child’s father, Stephen Wiesenfeld, with
sole responsibility for the care of Jason Paul.
For the eight months immediately following his
wife's death and all but a seven-month period thereafter,
Stephen Wiesenfeld did not engage in substantial gainful
employment.

Instead, he devoted himself to the care of the

infant, Jason Paul.
At issue, is the constitutionality of the gender
line drawn by 42 USC 402(G), the child in care provision of
the Social Security Act.
Congress established this child-in-eare insurance
in 1939 as part of that year's conversion of Social Security
from a system that Insured only the worker to a system that
provided a family basis of coverage.
The specific purpose of 402(G) was to protect
families of deceased insured workers by supplementing the
child benefits provided in 42 USC 402(D).Where the deceased
Insured worker is male, the family is afforded the full
measure of protection, a child's benefit under 402(D) and a

21
child in care benefit under 402(G).
Where the deceased worker is female, family
protection is subject to a 50 percent discount.

A child in

care benefit for survivors of a female-insured worker is
absolutely excluded, even though, as here, the deceased's
mother was the family principal breadwinner.
This absolute exclusion, based on gender per se,
operates to the disadvantage of female workers, their
surviving spouses and their children.
worker

It denies the female

social insurance family coverage of the same quality

as the coverage available under the account of a male
worker.
It denies the surviving spouse of a female worker
the opportunity to care personally for his child,an oppor­
tunity afforded the surviving spouse of the male worker,
and it denies the motherless child an opportunity for
parental care afforded the fatherless child.
It is Appellee’s position that this three-fold
discrimination violates the constitutional rights of Paula,
Stephen and Jason Paul Wiesenfeld to the Equal Protection of
the laws guaranteed them with respect to federal legislation
by the Fifth Amendment.
The care with which the judiciary should assess
gender lines drawn by legislation is currently a matter of
widespread uncertainty.

The District of Columbia Court of

22
Appeals recently observed in Waldie v. Schlesinger» decided
November 20th, 1974, "Precedent is still evolvingnand
existing decisions of this Court are variously interpreted
by the lower courts.
Appellant has urged in his brief that it would be
sufficient if any rationality can be conceived for the overt
sex discrimination operating against the Wiesenfeld family.
But this Court acknowledged in Reed v. Reed 404 US
that the legislative objective there in question, reducing
probate court work loads, did not lack legitimacy.
Yet, in light of the differential based on gender
per se, the Court required a more substantial relationship
between legislative ends and means so that men and women
similarly circumstanced would be treated alike.
Again, in the Court's eight-to-one judgment at
Frontiero v. Richardson 4ll U.S., requiring the same fringe
benefits for married men and women in the military, the
Court evidenced a concern to analyze gender classifications
with a view to the modern world and to be wary of gross,
archaic and overbroad generalizations.
As in the case at Bar, in Frontiero, the under­
lying assumption was, wives are typically dependent.
are not.

Hence, the statutory scheme in

Husbands

this case, as the

scheme in Frontiero, favors one type of family unit over
another and in both cases, the basis for the distinction is

23
that in the favored unit, the husband’s employment attracts
the benefit in question.

Where the breadwinner is male, the

family gets more and where the breadwinner is female;, the
family gets less.
Kahn v. Shevln *116 U.S. arid Schlesinger v. Ballard,
this Court's most recent expression, are viewed by some as
reestablishing slack or cursory review standards at least
when the defender of discrimination packages his argument
with a protective or remedial label.
Kahn approved Florida’s $15 real property tax
saving for widows.

The decision reflects this Court’s

consistent deference to state policy in areas of local
concern, such as state tax systems, domestic relations,
zoning, disposition of property within the state’s borders.
By contrast, National Workers’ Insurance and no
issue of local concern is in question here.
The differential in Schlesinger v. Ballard, this
Court pointed out, did not

reflect archaic* overbroad

generalizations of the kind involved in Frontiero or in the
Instant case.
Indeed, there might have been a certain irony to a
ruling in Lieutenant Ballard’s favor.
To this day, women seeking careers in the uniformed
services, are barred by federal statute and regulations from
enlistment, training and promotion opportunities open to men.

24
The Court’s majority thought it a mismatch for
federal law to mandate unequal treatment of women officers,
denial to them of training and promotion opportunities

open

to men, a denial not challenged by Lieutenant Ballard, but to
ignore that anterior discrimination for promotion and tenure
purposes.
Perhaps most

significantly, Kahn and Ballard are

among the very few situations where a discriminatory
advantage accorded some women is not readily perceived as a
double-edged sword, a weapon that strikes directly against
women who choose to be wives and mothers

and at the same

time, to participate as full and equal individuals in a workcentered world.
But there could not be a clearer case than this one
of the double-edged sword in operation of differential
treatment accorded similarly situated persons based grossly
and solely on gender.
Paula

Wiesenfeld, in fact the principal wage

earner, is treated as though her years of work were of only
secondary value to her family.

Stephen Wiesenfeld, in fact

the nurturing parent, is treated as though he did not perform
that function.

And Jason Paul, a motherless infant with a

father able and willing to provide care for him personally,
is treated as an infant not entitled to the personal care
of his sole surviving parent.

25
The line drawn is absolute, not merely a more
onerous test for one sex than the other, as in Frontlero
and in Stanley v. Illinois 405 U.S.

and the shut-out is

more extreme than it was in Reed, where a woman could
qualify as administrator if the. man who opposed her were
less closely related to the decedent.
This case, more than any other yet heard by this
Court, illustrates the critical importance of careful
judicial assessment of law-reinforced sex role pigeon-holing
defended as a remedy.

For on any degree of scrutiny that is

more than cursory, 402 (G)’s conclusive presumption auto­
matically and irrebuttably ranking husband principal bread­
winner displays the pattern Justice Brennan identified in
Frontlero.
In practical effect, laws of this quality help
to keep women, not on a pedestal but in a cage.

They rein­

force, not remedy, women’s inferior position in the labor

force.
Appellant has pointed out that women do not earn
as much as men and there Is the 402(G) response to this
condition by rectifying past and present economic discrimin­
ation against women.
This attempt to wrap a remedial rationale around
a 1939 statute originating in and reinforcing traditional
sex-based assumptions should attract strong suspicion.

26

In fact, Congress had in view male breadwinners,
male heads of household and the women and children dependent
upon them.
Its attention to the families of insured male
workers, their wives and children, is expressed in a scheme
that heaps further disadvantage on the woman worker,
Par from rectifying economic discrimination against
women, this scheme conspicuously discriminates against women
workers by discounting the value to their family of their
gainful employment and it includes, on private decision­
making in an area in which the law should maintain strict
neutrality for when federal law provides a family benefitbased on a husband's gainful employment but absolutely bars
that benefit based on a wife's

gainful employment, the

impact is to encourage the traditional division of labor
between man and woman.
To underscore twin assumptions first, that labor
for pay Including attendant benefits Is the prerogative of
men and, second, that women, but not men, appropriately
reduce their contributions in the working life to care for
children.
On another day, the pernicious Impact of gender
lines like the one drawn by 402(G) was precisely and
accurately discerned by Appellant In common with every
Government agency genuinely determined to break down

27
artificial barriers and hindrances to women’s economic
advancement.
Appellant has instructed that employers’ fringe
benefits and pension schemes must not presumes as 402(G)
does, that husband is head of household or principal wage
earner.
It is surely irrational to condemn this sex line
as discriminating against women when it appears in an
employer’s pension scheme while asserting that it rectifies
such discrimination when it appears In workers social
insurance.
QUESTION:

You said the Appellant has taken these

Inconsistent positions.

I assume it wasn't just his idea,

promulgating that for private pension schemes but that he
was carrying out his understanding of a federal statute.
MRS. GINSBURG:

He was carrying out inconsistent

Congressional commands, guidelines that he issued pursuant
to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.
QUESTION:

Right.

MRS. GINSBURG:

But barred recipients of federal

money from making distinctions of this kind.
In sum, the prime generator of discrimination
encountered by women in the economic sector is the pervasive
attitude now lacking functional justification that pairs
women with children, men with work.

28
This attitude' is shored up and reinforced by laws
of the *102 (6) variety, laws that tell a woman her employment
is less valuable to and supportive of the family than the
employment of a male worker.
Surely, Paula Wiesenfeld ’would find unfathomable
this attempt to cast a compensatory cloak over the denial
to her family of benefits available to the family of a male
insured.
Nor does Appellant’s rationalisation for dis­
crimination even attempt to explain Xtfhy Jason Paul, child
of a fully-insured deceased worker, can have the personal
care of his sole surviving parent only if the deceased wage
earning parent was male.
Appellant has asserted that providing child in
care benefits under a female worker’s account would involve
fiscal considerations.

The amount involved is considerably

less than was indicated some moments ago.
He estimates the cost for this particular benefit
to be .01 percent of taxable payroll in the Appendix at 16,
and other differentials are not now before this Court.
At the same time, he maintains —
QUESTION:

Are you familiar, Mrs. Ginsburg, with

the little chart on top of page 15 of the Appendix?
MRS. GINSBURG;
QUESTION:

Yes, I am.

Could you tell us which one of these are

we talking about?
MRS. GINSBURG;
QUESTION:

Which number?

MRS. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

Let's see —

Three?

MRS. GINSBURG:
right.

We are talking about —

We are talking about three.

Number of persons affected, 15,000.

That's

Estimated

benefit —
QUESTION:

20 million.

MRS. GINSBURG:

— 20 million, right.

And that is

the only one we are talking about in this case.
QUESTION:

And the — well, never mind.

MRS. GINSBURG:

And, of course, there is a somewhat

inconsistent argument made and that is that the bulk of
widowed fathers would not qualify for child in care benefits
in any event, according to Appellant, because unlike Stephen
Wiesenfeld, they would not devote themselves to child care
but, rather, to gainful employment.
Budgetary considerations —
QUESTION:

Are you talking — the children have to

be under what, 18?
MRS. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

Yes.

So long as — a child has to be a child

entitled to child's benefits under the Act.
QUESTION:

Urnn hmn.

Which means, among other things,

30
that he is under 18.
MRS. GINSBURG:

Yes.

Budgetary considerations to

justify invidious discriminations should fare no better in
this case than such considerations fared in cases in which
relatively larger cost savings xvere involved.
For example, Mew Jersey Welfare Rights Organization
against Cahill 4ll U.S. summarily

reversing 349 Federal

Supplement.
QUESTION:

What is the justification for benefits

for — with respect to children — persons under age 18 as
distinguished from having the line at 21 or 24 or some other
age?
MRS. GINSBURG:

I don’t know why the age line was

set but it is for all benefit purposes under the Social
Security Act.

I think a decision is made if a child is

attending school after 18 but I am not certain about it.
QUESTION:

You don’t need a babysitter for —

MRS. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

No, you certainly don’t.

— 12, 14, 16, 18-year-old people, do

you?
MRS. GINSBURG:

That is right, and whether that —

Congress has gone too far in that direction is not of concern
here.

Certainly it has not gone too far when it considers

that an infant, such as Jason Paul Wiesenfeld, might benefit
from the personal care of a parent.

31
QUESTION:

Well, is there any possibility that

the reasoning for his claim depends somewhat on this age
factor?
MRS. GINSBURG;
QUESTION:

The reasoning for —

The justification.

If the justification is not warranted, would that
enter into it?
MRS. GINSBURG:

Presumably the greatest need is

for very young children, preschool children and in many
cases, the sole surviving parent, male or .female, may not
avail herself, as the statute now stands, of this benefit
once the child gets beyond preschool age or school age.
Remember that this is not a benefit that is paid
automatically no matter what.

There is

an income limitation.

Once you earn beyond — well, it was $2,400 — one dollar of
benefit is removed for every two dollars earned.
So the parent who receives this benefit must be
performing that function, must be performing the child care
function.
QUESTION:

I suppose we are not confronted with

that age problem unless a 19-year-old makes an equal pro­
tection claim of some kind.
MRS. GINSBURG:

Well, with 18 years as the voting

age now, I think that is probably unlikely.
But in any event, comparing the cost analysis here

32
with the New Jersey Welfare Rights Organization case, that
case involved a wholly state-funded program for aid to
families of the working poor.
This Court declared unconstitutional limitation of
b enefits under that program to families with wed parents.
Unlike New Jersey Welfare Rights Organization, the
case at bar presents no issue of federal deference
arguably due to state family law policy or any other local
con cern.
And, surely, leeway for cost-saving is no broader
in Federal Workers’ Insurance than it is a wholly statefinanced and operated welfare program or program funded by
general state revenues rather than by contributions of
insured workers and their employers.
Budgetary policy, like administrative convenience,
simply cannot provide a fair and substantial basis for a
scheme that establishes two classes of insured workers,
both subject to the same contribution rates:
Male workers whose families receive full protection
and female workers whose families receive diminished pro­
tection.
Finally, the appropriate remedy is correctly
specified in the judgment below.

That judgment declares the

gender line at issue unconstitutional because it discriminates
in violation of the Fifth Amendment against gainfully

33
employed women such as Paula Wiesenfeld, as well as against
men and children v/ho have lost their vjives and mothers.
The judgment enjoins enforcement of the statute
insofar as it discriminates on the basis of sex.
Extension of child in care benefits under Paula
Wlesenfeld’s account is unquestionably the cost consistent
with the dominant Congressional purpose to insure the
family of deceased workers and the express Congressional
concern to ameliorate the plight of the deceased worker’s
child by facilitating a close relationship with the sole
surviving parent.
Unequal treatment of male and female workers
surely is not a vital part of the Congressional plan,

With­

drawal of benefits from female parents who noitf receive them
would conflict with the primary statutory objectives to
compensate the family unit for the loss of the insured indivi­
dual and to facilitate parental care of the child.
Under the circumstances, extension of benefits to
the surviving spouse of female insured workers to the father
who devotes himself to childrearing is the only suitable
remedy.

It accords with the express remedial preference

of Congress in all recent measures eliminating gender-based
differentials.

For example, 5 USC 7152 cited at pages 39 to

40 of our brief.
And with this Court’s precedent in such cases as

34
U. S. Department of Agriculture v. Moreno 413 U.S., New
Jersey Welfare Rights Orp;anisation against Cahill 411 U.S.
and Frontiero v. Richardson 411 U. S.
I did want to comment very briefly on the point
made with respect to women receiving

Social Security

benefits that exceed the amount of their contributions.
The reason for this, the prime
is that women live longer than men.

reason, of course,

Most benefits are paid

to retirement age beneficiaries and women happen to be
58 percent of the population of persons over 65.

That

increases in time.
They are about 54 and a half percent of the 65
year olds, 58 and a half percent of the

75 year olds, and

about 64 and half percent of the 85 year olds.
But the critical point here is that payments to
the elderly are based on the idividual’s life span, not on
his or her sex so that if a man should live to be 100, he
will continue to receive benefits and he won't be told, too
bad, you should have died earlier, only women receive payments
for that length of time.

Women Workers National Social Insurance is no less valuable

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mrs. Ginsburg.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Jones?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEITH A. JONES, ESQ.
MR. JONES:

Yes, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

First, I would like to correct a typographical
error on page 15 of the Appendix.
In Item number 2 it says, "Eliminate the dependency
requirement of Section 202(d)."
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:

That should be "202(f)."

(f)?
That is right.

I point out that the Appellee here has distinguished
Kahn against Shevin on which we rely — or tried to distin­
guish it only on two bases.

One is by relying upon the

private inusrance paradigm that a female wage earner is
entitled to a certain amount of insurance coverage.
I discussed that at length in my opening
argument.
The second is that Kahn in some sense represents
deference towards state taxing policies that, Appellee
claims, would not be due to federal welfare policies.
That I understand is an analytical matter by
federal distribution of public welfare funds and should not
be entitled to the same deference as state taxing policies.

Appellee also argues that the child here somehow

basis for that.
Act.

I see no

The child has his own benefits under the

His only claim here is that one of his parents didn't

get benefits.
That claim is derivative from the claim of the
parent and cannot be analyzed separately from it.
QUESTION:

Well, he is a third-party beneficiary,

isn’t he?
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

That is right.
I mean, the purpose of giving benefits

to the parent is so that he can stay home and take car® of
the child, right?
MR. JONES:

Well, I don't think that this legisla­

tive history backs that up necessarily.
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:

What is the purpose, then?
Well, the legislative history shows

that the purpose of the statute was to distribute benefits
in accordance with the probable need of beneficiaries and it
was made on an individual and

not on a family basis and it

simply represents the judgment that women who seek employment
are less likely to find it than are men and that If they do
find it, they are likely to earn less than do men.

children •—

Yes, but this doesn't — if there are no

MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

If there were no children, there —
Those conditions, those presumptive

conditions would still prevail, wouldn’t they?
MR. JONES;

If there are no children the problems

of job discrimination at least would not be exascerbated by
the need to provide child care during the working hours.
There is, I think, a justifiable difference
between treatment of widows generally and the widows with
minor children.
If there are no further questions —
