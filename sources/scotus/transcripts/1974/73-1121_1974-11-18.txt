MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 73-1121, North Georgia Finishing against
Dl-Chem.
Mr. Coppedge, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WARREN N. COPPEDOE, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. COPPEDGE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The case presented to the Court today is a
garnishment action involving Title 46, Section 101 ed sec
of the Code of Georgia which provides for projudgment
garnishment by a plaintiff upon a defendant's, bank account
without notice to the defendant.
The authority for our position before this Court
today is contained in this Court’s decision in Sniadach,
Puentes versus Shevin, and Mitchell versus

V/. T. Grant,

Company.
We also consider the authority of goddie versus
Connecticut 401

US 371 to be especially applicable to the

facts of this case.
Now, the facts are that on August the 20th, 1971,
Di-Chem, Inc. filed a suit on account against North Georgia
Finishing and concurrently therewith and in immediate

4
sequential order, filed a garnishment action and served a
summons of garnishment upon the First National Bank of
Dalton3 Georgia.
Now, the summons of garnishment was issued by a
clerk of the court.

It was based only upon the conclusory

allegation that the plaintiff had reason to apprehend the
loss of a sum of money or a part thereof and by this process
of gai’nishment issue.
The summons required the garnishee to answer in
not less than 30 nor more than 45 days all of the property
that it had at the time of service belonging to the
defendant and all of the property that might have come into
its possession in the interim and this is notwithstanding
the fact that all of the property may have been more or less
than was sued for by the plaintiff in the case.
QUESTION:

Now —

The issuing and the affidavit follows

the statute, doesn't it?
MR. COPPEDGE:

Yes, sir, it is exactly parallel to

the statute and as a matter of fact, It is a printed
allegation supplied to people by the local printing industry
in courts and you merely fill in the blanks.
QUESTION:

Well, what's v/rong with that if you

have to have it?
MR. COPPEDGE:
QUESTION:

Nothing is wrong with it.

If it isn't true, then you don't sign

5
the affidavit»
MR. COPPEDGE:

Insofar as form, nothing is wrong

with it.
Now, the Georgia practice, as stated in Powell
versus Powell at at 95 Georgia Appeals 122 provides that a
defendant in such a case is not even a party to the case
and is not entitled to any notice, either preseizure or
postseizure.
He is just not a party to the case until he posts
bond.
In this case, North Georgia Finishing posted bond
as soon as the courthouse opened after the weekend was over.
The garnishment was issued on Friday afternoon.

And in

doing so —
QUESTION: So he is party to the main action,
isn’t he?
MR. COPPEDGE:
QUESTION:

Pardon?

He is a party to the main action.

MR. COPPEDGE:

He is a party to the main action,

but he is not a party to this action.
QUESTION:

But the main action is then pending in

contrast to the Sniadach situation, maybe, in Wisconsin.
MR. COPPEDGE:

The main action continues to pend

and it must be filed prior to the garnishment action.

In

this case, it was the immediate preceding sequentially«filed

6
case.
And then Worth Georgia Finishing posted its bond
to do two things.

One is, to substitute property.

That is5

to substitute a bond for its bank account which was a
commercial bank account which had been tied up by virtue of
the garnishment.
And, secondly, under the authority of the Georgia
court, it posted bond in order to gain access to the court,
in order to establish standing.
QUESTION:

Mr. Coppedge —

MR. COPPEDGE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir?

Did your client have an opportunity, at

the time they posted the bond, to challenge the accuracy of
the statements in the affidavit?
MR. COPPEDGE:

No, sir and there is no statutory

provision provided by Georgia law for either a preseizure
hearing or a postseizure hearing.
As a matter of

fact, we have no standing in the

case until we post a bond and this is why we think the
authority of Boddie versus Connecticut would be especially
applicable because, as we understand that case, it says that
access to the court shall not be a function of a financial
requirement,
QUESTION:

Well, after you posted the bond in this

case, did you contest the affidavit anywhere?

7
MR. COPPEDGE:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

I was under the impression you did.

I

don't know where I got it from.
MR. COPPEDGE:
the trial judge.

No, sir, there was a hearing before

There were allegations in the motion to

set aside that the affidavit was groundless.
However, there was nothing heard on that particular
allegation.

We do not consider that we have authority

under the Georgia statute to assert such.
There was an allegation in our motion to set
aside the garnishment.
QUESTION:

You made an allegation'but you don't

think it had any basis or justification under the lav;.
T1R. COPPEDGE:

Yes, I don't think it had any and

there was no evidence presented.

We merely argued this

Court's Sniadach opinion.
QUESTION:

Did you attempt to introduce any

evidence?
MR. COPPEDGE:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

Hr. Coppedge, Is your client still in

business?
MR. COPPEDGE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

It hasn’t gone Into bankruptcy?

MR. COPPEDGE:

No, sir.

My client is not in

business as North Georgia Finishing Company any longer.

It

8
changed its name to Beaver* Creek Carpet Mills, Inc.,

to

more correctly reflect its nature of business and that is,
the general manufacture of carpets rather than carpet
finishing.
It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of

Beaver Creek

Mills, Inc., which is a subsidiary of another company.

They

are no longer active in manufacturing and selling carpet but
they are still a corporate entity and still in existence.
QUESTION:

What happened to the underlying litiga­

tion here?
MR. COPPEDGE:

The underlying litigation still

pends and there has been no hearing on it.
Our purpose today, may it please the Court, is not
necessarily to rehash the route and. base previously filed
but there have been a number of recent cases following
Mr. Justice White's opinion in Mitchell versus V/. T. Grant
case.
QUESTION:

I would say that was the Court's

Court.«

Mr. Justice White speaking for the

«

We would take an opportunity to call this Court’s
attention to*several of those cases that have flowed from
this Court's opinion in Mitchell

versus W. T. Grant and we

would take this opportunity to state that we are in

9
agreement with all that we have found.
The first is a case of September the 4th, 1974
in the Supreme Court of Georgia, is the case of Roberts
versus McCauley at 232 Georgia 660.
QUESTION:

Are these here, too?

MR. COPPEDGE:

No, sir, they are not.

They are

subsequent cases.
QUESTION:

Would you mind stating that again?

MR. COPPEDGE:

Roberts versus McCauley 232 Georgia

660 wherein Justice Hall, speaking for six of the seven
justices of that court, quoted with approval Mitchell versus
W. T. Grant and stated that the one overrj.ding constitu­
tional problem presented by the Georgia possessory warrant
statute which ’was the statute under consideration in that
case, was the absence of judicial control over the
institution of the proceedings which could tie'
application to a court clerk.

begun by

;,t

In this case, in the garnishment c&se before this
court, it was commenced by application to a court clerk.
In this case of Roberts versus McCauley, the court
recognized the Puentes decision of this Court, which it did
not recognize ’when we were before that court.
It declared the Georgia

possessory warrant

statute unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

It doesn’t suggest this ought to go

10
back to the Georgia Supreme Court for reconsideration, does
it?
MR. COPPEDGE:

No, sir, I don’t believe so and I

don’t —
QUESTION:
dlvestage

I gather you suggest, under the

statute they reached a conclusion contrary to

this one —
MR. COPPEDGE:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:—based upon the subsequent decision
about Mitchell and they didn’t deal with Puentes and now
they consider Puentes.
MR. COPPEDGE:

No, sir, they did hot deal with

Puentes when we were before that court.
the case of American Olean Tile

They dealt with

Company versus Zimmerman ,

a Hawaiian case and cited that as their authority.
Subsequent to that time, the Supreme Court of
Hawaii has declared non-notice seizures of bank accounts to
be unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

Based again

MR. COPPEDGE:

on Mitchell?

No, sir, that was pre-Mitchell.

In the case of Brunswick Corporation versus Galaxy

Cocktail

Lounge at 513 Pacific 2nd 1390.
QUESTION:

What is the title?

MR. COPPEDGE:

Brunswick Corporation versus

Galaxy Cocktail Lounge, Inc.

11

QUESTION:

What is the nature of the possessory

warrant in Georgia?
MR. COPPEDGE:

Possessory warrants in Georgia

were first enacted in 1822 and were a means of summarily
bestowing possession of runaway slaves or other property.
QUESTION:

I take it it has a different purpose

now.
MR. COPPEDGE:
QUESTION:

Pardon?

I take it it has a different purpose

now.
MR. COPPEDGE:

Well, runaway slaves or other

property and it has been applied to other property since

1865.
Now, it is no different, in effect, from the
provisions of the garnishment statute in that it alters
possession of property pending suit
QUESTION:

and prior to hearing.

Well, does garnishment really alter

possession of property?

What kind of

a property right

do you claim against the garnishment statutes?
MR. COPPEDGE:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, our

position is that this particular piece of property — and
this is one of the reasons we feel this case is distin­
guishable from the Mitchell case is that we are entitled to
the money in the bank.
The bank is

12

Well, are you under Georgia, law?

Supposing that the bank went into receivership and went
bankrupt?
claim,

Your claim wouldn’t be regarded as a trustee fund

would it?
MR, COPPEDGE:
QUESTION:

No —

Just an ordinary debt.

MR, COPPEDGE:

I suppose we itfould have to look to

the FDIC to satisfy our ordinary debt.
QUESTION:

Of course you vxould if it were

insurance, but typically, a depositor’s claim against a
bank isn’t property in the sense of having a right to a
particular group of bills in the bank's vault, it just
shows an action.

It is a contract.

MR. COPPEDGE:

It is a creditor-debtor relation­

ship, that is correct.
QUESTION:

And nothing was transferred by this

garnishment, was it?
MR. COPPEDGE:

Yes, sir.

We have a right under

our contract with that bank to make use of the funds that
we have deposited in that bank and it is the deprivation of
the use of the funds.

The use is the only purpose to which

bank accounts and money can be put, to my knowledge.

It is

the only thing ■—
QUESTION:

Well, what was the Supreme Court of

GEorgia's analogy in this case, that it is like a lis

13

pendens

on property?
MR. COPPEDGE:
QUESTION:

Because —

It prevents you from using the property,

but it doesn't transfer possession.
MR. COPPEDGE:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the lis

pendens in Georgia pertains only to a situation where there
are equities on the property.
Number one, lis

pendens cannot be asserted in

Georgia unless an equitable claim of title is asserted
against property.
Secondly, lis

pendens leaves the- property in the

use and possession of that person against

whom the lis

pendens writ is filed.
Lis

pendens is applicable, "in ouriopinion, only

to real estate or perhaps to a mechanics-type lien,
laborers lien, a. materialman's lien wherein that property is
left in the possession, U3e and enjoyment of the contended
debtor and only can be issued in an equitable situation
and there are several cases on that point, Watson versus
Whatley at 218 Georgia 86.
QUESTION:

Are these cited in your; brief?

MR. COPPEDGE:

No, six0.

Yes, sir, they are.

are footnoted in the brief, excuse me.
QUESTION:

They

Now ~-

When you speak of not being

able to

use this money, you can use it by putting up the bond,

can't you?
MR. COPPEDGE:

Yes, sir, but in that instant, all

we have done is substituted one form of our property with
another and we believe that this Court’s opinion in the
Puentes case, where it indicated that we have been deprived
of our property -■

and we are still deprived of our property

because that bond shows up on our corporate financial state­
ment as a binding obligation of the corporation.
All we have done is substituted the type of
property that we have been deprived.
QUESTION:

Well, if you had a debt outstanding,

would it be any different on your balance sheet?
MR. COPPEDGE:

Sir, this debt is very much a

contested debt and we submit to the Court that the principal
use of prejudgment garnishments in. Georgia are as an
economic bludgeon to either force settlement on more
favorable terms or surrender.
QUESTION:

Well, I don't know that the condition

of your balance sheet is very crucial to this kind of a case
but the fact is that honest accounting would require you to
shot-1 some kind of a contingency liability based upon the
maximum possible claim that might be established against
you, wouldn't it?
MR. COPPEDGE:

Your Honor, I don't believe so.

I think, certainly, we do have to properly account and post

15
our balance sheets.

But If we honestly contend that we

don’t owe anybody any money and we are sued for this money
on open account, I think — I am not familiar with accounting
practices enough to say whether or not we have got to shew
that except as a contingent liability under suits.
QUESTION:

If you have a liability against you,

your accountant would unquestionably tell you you had better
put something in your statement if you are issuing a state­
ment to a bank.
MR. COPPEQGE:

In the statement, your Honor,

concerning a contingent liability and litigation, but I
don’t think we would have to list it in the assets and
liabilities of the corporation that it is an acknowledged
debt.
As a matter of fact, I have had a case where
that was done and I used it as evidence against the debtor.
QUESTION:

Mr. Coppedge, what assets did North

Georgia have in the State of Georgia?

It was a foreign

corporation.
MR. COPPEDGE:

Yes, sir.

It had a finishing house.

It had a carpet mill and it had a bank account.
QUESTION:

Were these plant facilities subject

to mortgage?
MR. COPPEDGE:

I am sure they were.

I would state

to the Court that they were but I have no independent

16
knowledge of that,

But I am certain that there were real

estate mortgages and I am certain that there were factoring
contracts with various of the factoring corporations.
QUESTION:

You averred in your motion that there

was no reason to believe that there was any danger of assets
not being sufficient.

There was no proof one way or the

other on that.
MR. COPPEDGE:

No, sir, there was no proof one

way or the other.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. COPPEDGE:

To answer your Honor's question in

a little more detail, we believe that Mr. Justice Stewart's
opinion in the Puentes case that due process tests should be
based upon the merits of the case and not upon the relative
financial strength of the parties and at page 1996, Fuentes
states clearly that a bond is no replacement to due process
hearing before a neutral hearing officer with discretion
and notes that a bond merely replaces one piece of property
with another and does nothing to advance the cause of due
process.
We agree with the Court in that decision that a
bond offers only minimal protection and we note that the
deprivation is for 30 to 45 days of all of the property
which that bank would have in its possession on deposit
from our company is not limited by the amount we put in.

17
QUESTION:
minimal protection?

What do you mean by offering only
bond
This is a double-bound, isn't it, that

the other side has to put up?
MR. COPPEDGE:

Yes, sir, but it just doesn’t

address the issue of fairness and due process.

It doesn't

establish the Mitchell case test required, as we read the
Mitchell case, that there must be some judicial officer
with discretion to issue this seizure warrant, that there
must be some facts stated upon xtfhich to base the seizure
warrant, that there must be some reasonable hearing
following the issuance of the seizure warrant.
None of these things are provided for in the
Georgia statutory scheme.

Further, we think that the

Mitchell decision is support for our position before this
Court in that the Mitchell decision limits itself, or
apparently limits itself to property wherein both the
debtor and the creditor have a legal and equitable interest,
that is, by virtue of title retention contract.
QUESTION:

Well, you can distinguish the facts

in Mitchell as the other1 side can distinguish the facts
in Sniadach, too.
You are kind of in between them, aren't you, under
the Georgia system?
MR. COPPEDGE:

I think not, for this reason.

The

Wisconsin statute, as I understand it, number one, you did

18
not have to post a bond to gain access to the courts as
you do in

Georgia,
Number two, in Wisconsin, the garnishment auto­

matically dissolved after ten days.

There is no such

disillusion feature in Georgia.
QUESTION:

And number three, I may be wrong as to

this, in Wisconsin, couldn’t your garnishment action ante­
date the main action?
MR. COPPEDGE:

I am not sure, your Honor.

I am

not sure and I did not consider that in this case.
QUESTION:

Of course, for a wage garnishment,

when you are talking about dissolution after ten days,
that probably means two pay days.

It

certainly doesn’t

mean that after ten days you give back the money held
during those two pay days.

It just means it doesn't apply

beyond ten days, doesn’t it?
MR. COPPEDGE:
QUESTION:

I believe that is correct.

And In your case, I take it, once your

bank account is garnished, you don’t go on depositing money
in there.

You get a new bank account.
MR. COPPEDGE;
QUESTION:

I certainly hope so.

I would hope.

MR. COPPEDGE:

Yes, sir, but they'll go after

any other bank account I have.
issue a new summons.

All they have to do is

19
QUESTION:

Well, but that might be evidence of

harrassment or attempt at leverage.

If they have enough

tied up to satisfy their claim, I would presume they
wouldn't do any more.
MR. COPPEDGE:

You don’t know, your Honor, for

30 days it could be considerably more that they have tied
up.

They can tied up $200,000 on a $100,000 bond, if that is

what is in the bank.
QUESTION:

Subject to an interlocutory motion?

MR. COPPEDGE:

There is no statutory provision

In practice, I'll call the other lav/yer up and say,

QUESTION:

How about reducing it?

power in the court to Issue an order to trim it down to

would call two other cases to the Court's
The first is a case of the United States

District Court in Texas and it is cited at 43 Law Week
2120, GArcia versus Crouse.

When that court held the Texas

statute which appears to be parallel to the Georgia statute
in

material part unconstitutional following the opinion of

this Court in the Mitchell case and also a three-judge court

20

of the Southern District of New York in Sugar versus Curtis
Circulation Company at 43 Law Week 2183 which also followed
the Mitchell opinion of this Court and held the New York
statute unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

Mr. Coppedge, if this

Court were to

agree with you as to the infirmities of the present Georgia
statute and the Georgia legislature wanted to go back and
try to make some constitutional provision whereby a plaintiff
in a case like this suing an out-of-state corporation could
get some sort of security that would ultimately satisfy a
judgment if It got it, what could the legislature do?
MR. COPPEDGE:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I have no

objection whatsoever and so stated in my brief that we do
not oppose what we consider to be this Court’s attempt to
reach a constitutional accommodation between the rights of
debtors and the rights of creditors by providing some safe­
guard, either immediately prior to the issuement of the
attachment or the right of hearing after the attachment —
QUESTION:

A hearing prior to the attachment is

useless if you have got a debtor with a tendency to abscond.
He won’t have any money in the bank the minute he gets
notice of the hearing.
MR. COPPEDGE:

Your Honor, I said either and I

think that the courts could issue an interlocutory order
requiring property under injunction to be held for three

21
or four days
QUESTION:

So you say —

MR. COPPEDGE:
QUESTION:

— till they could have a hearing.

— there could be some sort of seizure

prior to the hearing on the merits.
MR. COPPEDGE:

Absolutely.

Absolutely.

We think

that there should be a constitutional accommodation some­
where but a clerk issuing a seizure upon conclusion without
even preseizure or post seizure hearing just doesn’t measure
up, in our opinion.
QUESTION:

Is your Interest that you want pro­

tected just your interest in having an erroneous judgment
issued against you?

Is it the risk of error that worries

you?
MR. COPPEDGE:
QUESTION:
really a debt here.

I think —

You are not claiming that there is
You are not claiming that there should

not be prejudgment security.
MR. COPPEDGE:

No, sir.

If it is properly

Issued under proper control and safeguards.

I am claiming

that we can be bludgeoned, economically by interrupting the
commercial course of business.
QUESTION:

But if a creditor went to a judge with

a piece of paper and swore before the judge these facts and
the judge thought that gave him probable cause, at least,

22
pending some further hearing, you wouldn’t have any
objection to that?
MR. COPPEDGE:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

No, sir.

So what it boils down to is a differ­

ence between a clerk here and a judge in the case positive
adjusted way.
MR. COPPEDGE:

Vie think that is one of the basic

The other is the fact that it is issued upon

conclusory allegations without saying anything.
'7

QUESTION:

Do you take it even as between two

farily equal people, debtor and creditor, you don’t think
from your client's standpoint that you get any — you get
sufficient protection against the risk of error against
the claim of a debt that really isn't there from the
plaintiff posting a double bond?
MR. COPPEDGE:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

It is a devastating —

Well, it may be devastating but it

has cost him some money.

If he is wrong it is really — he

isn’t —
MR, COPPEDGE:
is not to pay him double.

No, but the condition of the bond
The condition of the bond is

only to pay what money I am out in defending it.
QUESTION:

I know, but It costs him.

It costs

him money to put up the bond.
MR. COPPEDGE:

If he has a professional bonding

23

company.

If he gets the vice-president of the company to

sign the bond as he did in this case, it doesn't.
QUESTION:

What are the elements of damages In an

action on the bond in Georgia?
MR. COPPEDGE:

Only to pay what money you are out

in defending the bond should it appear that it should not
have been issued.
QUESTION:

You mean, the only fee you can recover

is the cost of defense?
MR. COPPEDGE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Not damage?

MR. COPPEDGE:

All damages which, in my opinion,

don't go to double the bond.

They go to wherever we can

show we are out.
QUESTION:

In other words, there isn’t any penalty.

It Is just compensatory damages.
MR. COPPEDGE:

It Is whatever I can prove.

QUESTION:

Mr. Coppedge, I just want to be sure I

understand your position.

Would you be content if Georgia

law provided a prompt hearing after the garnishment at which
you could raise all of the issues that you have in mind?

24
I©. COPPEDGE:
QUESTION:

Absolutely.

In other words, you don't insist on a

prior hearing, but you —
MR. COPPEDGE:

I insist that a judge issue the

sequestration warrant and not a clerk.
QUESTION:

Yes.

But you don’t insist on a

hearing at that point.
MR. COPPEDGE:

I insist at the least that it be

ex parte before a judge who exercises discretion and hears
something other than a conclusion.
I don't Insist that I have to be present.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. COPPEDGE:

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

You may have now about seven minutes, Mr. Kemp,
but you can get started that way.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF L. HUGH KEMP, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. KEMP:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
I will end when the clock sounds.

I have my

family here and I have to take them back on the train
tonight but I think I can cover the essential points.
Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
I will take up three points and rely on my brief

25
on my constitutionality of the Georgia statute.
The first is, as indicated by Mr. Justice Powell,
we think they waived their rights.

The garnishment issued.

They filed a bond, not to create standing but to free up
this bank account.
Three weeks later, as an afterthought, after having
read a little law, perhaps, they came in and filed an assault
and an attack and paragraph 11, to answer Mr. Justice Powellb
paragraph three, said Plaintiff had no reason to apprehend
the loss of any judgment and then three weeks after they
filed the bond, not to create standing but to free the bank
account, they came in and had an opportunity to have a
complete and a full hearing of any kind and at their
insistence it was heard and the judge of the Whitfield
Superior Court entered an order in which he denied each and
every of the grounds on page 10 and 11 of the Appendix of
the North Georgia’s brief.
We say they waived any rights.

There is no issue any more.

It is

Just as when the lawsuit is graduated, the issue

out of Washington or Oregon became moot.
Secondly, and I don’t want to get into an
argument of counsel as to whether or not his client is
solvent or not but I respectfully submit and state

in my

place that what has happened is exactly what Mr. Foster
said when he filled out this affidavit, that the funds
will not be forthcoming to answer the garnishment and we
submit that if the Court does want to make an inquiry, it
is not in the record, but the insolvency of the debtor, if
it, in fact, existed, would make the garnishment moot.
Thirdly, and the third point is, we make the point
in our brief that the Georgia statute — and your Honors, I
think, have inquired into the barest areas that I cover in
my brief, is constitutional and we distinguish it, we think,
from Fuentes and bring it under the Mitchell decision and
the recent decisions on the last week of the Court on
seizure of automobiles and similar recent cases which I

27
don't have cited in my brief because they came down after the
brief was typed.
The main point I want to make otherwise is that
even if this Court should reach Mr. Coppedge's conclusion
and assertions that the statute is

unconstitutional,

unconstitutional for failure to provide notices, that it
should not be applied retroactively.
This case was filed in August of 1971.
had been decided.

Sniadach

But it certainly didn’t presage Fuentes♦

That was limited to the specialized wagers.
Fuentes had not been decided when the case was
argued in the trial court in December of 1971 and when the
trial court had issued its order.
Under the case of hlnkletter versus Walker, cited
in our case and the other cases cited in our,brief3 this
Court has held that it will not apply retroactively so as to
dislodge established reliance on a statute.
Most recently in the case of Lemon versus Kurtzman,
which involved the Pennsylvania State reimbursing sectarian
schools notwithstanding the fact that the statute had been
declared unconstitutional, the Court refused to apply the
statute or the unconstitutional holding backwards.
In that case, the Court stated, "Statutory or
even judge-made rules of law are hard facts on which people
must rely in making decisions.

This fact of legal life

28
underpins our modern decisions, recognising a doctrine of
nonretroactivity."
So we say in this case, your Honor, we respect­
fully submit, we don't think the statute is unconstitu­
tional.

We don't think that you should ever reach the

issue because of waiver and because of mootness.
But even if you do reach it and agree with
Counsel for Petitioner, we respectfully submit that Di-Chem
has relied on it.

The only thing they have got is this

bond now, if they are going to get anything.
was no holding or foreshadowing of Puentes.

That there
That, therefore,

it would be unequitable and under this Court's doctrine as
stated in the Kurtzman case and in the Walker and Linkletter
case, that if the Court does reach a conclusion that the
Georgia, statute is unconstitutional for any reason whatever,
that it should be given prospective application only and
it should not be applied retroactively because what we are
talking about here is Di-Chem's right to get this
$51,000 and I am not sure that even the bond is solvent at
this time because of the various and sundry things that
have gone on in these corporations, but at least, we
respectfully submit that we should have our right to go
after North Georgia and after its bondsman.
Thank you for your attention.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kemp —

MR. KEMP:

Yes, your Honor.

QUESTION:

Why hasn’t the main litigation been

tried in three years?
MR. KEMP:

We have been waiting to see what the

ultimate outcome is going to be, whether there is going to
be a bond available and if there is no bond available, we
are on this case on a contingency and aside, we have got
about 300 or 400 hours in it and unless there was a bond
available, there was no use going ahead and trying the main
action because that would just eat up more judicial time
'

,

and more effort.
QUESTION:

■•of
There is a direct conflict now between

your state court and the District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia in the Atlanta Division.
MR. KEMP:

Yes, your Honor.

QUESTION:

What is the practical situation down

there new, with this conflict existing?
MR. KEMP:

I don’t really know.

in Atlanta, I can’t understand it.

As far as I know,

If I want to issue a

garnishment in Atlanta, I have no problems.

Of course, our

superior court judge will not let us issue one.

He follows

the suggestion somewhat suggested by Justice REhnquist.
We go over with an order and say — and take our
client with us and swear him in and say that they are going
to run off with this money, your Honor,if you don’t issue

3°
this garnishment.

He issues the garnishments gives them

three days to show why it shouldn’t be dissolved.
QUESTION:

And that, in his view, satisfies what

was held by the Federal Court in Morrow Electric Company
against Cruse?
MR. KEMP:

To my knowledge, yes, sir.

That is

the practice and as a matter of fact, Mr. Coppedge is the
one that thought up this procedure where we could keep on
tying up people's money.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kemp, when the judge -— you

mentioned — gives three days, is that

provided by

statute in Georgia, or is that just a policy?
MR. KEMP:

Just a policy.

Usually, on any kind

of — any type of judgment we have three days to show
cause and on that point, a wife can tie up a .man’s property
by filing a suit and he has got a client of mine with
$3 million that has

got everything he has got tied up

right now with a 11s pendens in a divorce action and she
wants it all.

We can't sell it.

We can't borrow on it.

We can't sell our stock.
So a lis pendens is a pretty effective item in
our state.
Thank you again, your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OP WARREN N. COPPEDGE, ESQ.
MR. COPPEDGE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
I would just like to answer Mr. Justice Stewart’s
question.
Because of the situation in Georgia created not
only by the Morrow Electric case , but also Aaron versus
Clark at 3^2 Fed. Supp. 898, we have

jury-rigged a situation

whereby if we want to restrain property, we contend under
the Georgia general equity statutes that we have no adequate
legal remedy, that because of the conflict arid the decisions
of the Court, we have no adequate legal remedy.
We take our client in.
the judge.

We swear him in before

He testifies and the Court issues an ex parte

injunction requiring the Defendant to appear in a very
short time and show cause and we think that the GEneral
Assembly of Georgia should render this the dignity of
statute because without it, we don’t have a fair system of
sequesterinp; property.
QUESTION:

Mr. Coppedge, what the Superior Court

of Whitfield County did was to refuse to dissolve the
garnishment.

Isn’t that right?

MR. COPPEDGE:

The Superior Court of Whitfield

County denied our motion to dismiss the case.
QUESTION:

To dismiss the —

32

MR. COPPEDGE;

The garnishment ease on the

constitutional grounds asserted which at the time were the
Sniadach case.
QUESTION:

Well, the Supreme Court of Georgia

upheld that rule.
Now, If we were to reverse that, what would be
the effect of our reversal on the liability on the bond?
MR. COPPEDGE:

I think that there would be no

liability on the bond because the liability of the
condition of the bond is set forth in the Appendix which
your Honor has before you, is to pay such judgment as may
be rendered in this case and that refers to the garnishment
case.
In Georgia, what you do is, you get a judgment
in your main case and then if it is not paid, then you go
through the other case and now they have not pursued the
main case and there Is a counterclaim pending in the main
case and I assume that that \irould be pursued later.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen,

the case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 3:03 o’clock p.m., the case
was submitted.]
