MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We’ll hear arguments

first this morning in No, 73-S336, Rogers against the United
States»
Mr. Parnell, you may proceed whenever you’re ready»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RALPH W, PARNELL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, PARNELL;

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
This is a cause which arose in the district court
in Louisiana as the result of a statement that was made by
one George Herman Rogers on March 23rd, 1972,

[sic]

At the time that the statement was made, Mr, Rogers
was at a Holiday Inn in Shreveport, Louisiana at approxi­
mate ly six o'clock in idle morning.
As a result of this statement, Mr. Rogers was charged
with a violation of 18 U.S.C.A, 871(a), which reads as
follows s
"Whoever knowingly and willfully deposits for
conveyance in the mail or for a delivery from any post
dffice or by any letter carrier any letter, paper,
writing, print, missive, or document containing any
threat to take the life of or to inflict bodily harm
upon the President of the United States, the President­
elect, the Vice President or other officer next in the

4
order of succession to the office of President or the
United States# or the Vice President-elect# or knowingly
and willfully otherwise makes any such threat against the
President# President-elect# Vice President, or other®' —
’sic1®

next officer in succession to the office of President or
Vice President,"shall be fined not more than $1,000 or
imprisoned not more than five years, or both."
The statement or statements that Mr» Rogers has
been charged to have made# as I said were made at six o’clock
in the morning?

initially made in the presence of three

waitresses cfc this particular Holiday l'nn.

The reaction of the

three ladies that heard th© statement -- they all described him
as being "odd", "irrational", "something wrong with him."
The statements that were charged in the indictment
wore taken out of context, they were taken out of a discussion
that Mr. Rogers was trying to have with the three waitresses.
Mr, Rogers had expressed to all three that he was very much
upset about, at the time, President Nixon's trip to China.
This ©vent took place immediately after President
Nixon's trip to China,
Mr. Rogers, in his comments, said that he disagreed
with President Nixon being in China, that the President was
"consorting with our enemy"? he did not like the Communists#
did not like the Rad Chinese, he was very upset with our
President "selling us out", and for that he was going to

5
Washington to "beat his ass".
This# in essence# is what Mr. Rogers is charged with.
He said this# allegedly# on five occasions.

The words being

the same.
QUESTION?

The five occasions# three of them were

that morning in the Holiday Inn dining room# and two were
later to the police officers# is that it?
MR. PARNELL:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

That is correct.

Substantially the same statement each

time.
MR. PARNELL;

Substantially the same statement#

also substantially the same conversation each time.
QUESTION:

Was there something said about killing

the President?
MR, PARNELL:
to the police officers.

This was said# I believe# Your Honor#
That, is correct.

Each time that Mr. Rogers tried to engage in a
conversation or discussion of the political topic of the day#
which was President Nixon's trip to China# he was rebuffed
nobody was really listening to him.

One cf the witnesses#

one of the gentlemen that heard the statement said that he
was somewhat irritated by Mr. Rogers' disturbance# he was
disturbing him? this man was a businessman# he was trying to
get ready for his day's work# and Mr. Rogers was disturbing
him from thinking about his business of the day.

6
All witnesses said that they initially thought that
Mr. Rogers was intoxicated.

One witness, one of the waitresses,

said that she smelled a faint odor of alcohol on Mr. Rogers'
breath.
She also said that, in her conversation with Mr.
Rogers, that it was raining and that she said that she wished
that it vTould stop raining? and at this point Mr. Rogers
informed her that he could make it stop raining.

And she said

that she laughed at this and thought that "maybe we ought to
leave that to a higher power"; and Mr. Rogers informed her
that he was that higher power, that he was Jesus Christ.
These statements, taken in this context, we feel like
are not and cannot be prosecuted under the statute that I read,
under 18 U.S.C.A. 871(a).
This statute is a good statute.

Certainly the United

States has a paramount right and duty to protect its highest
officer, the President of the United States.
It would not — if we do not protect our highest
officer froma serious or true threat, then we would certainly
be jeopardizing not only his life but his enforcement or his
duties, or carrying out his duties.
The purpose of this statute, or at least the history
of it, the legislative, history of it indicates that in 1916,
at the time the statute was passed, that the President was
having some difficulty with written threats.

Mr» Webb f in arguing for passage of the legisla­
tion, stated that the written documents that the President
was receiving was annoying to him, was irritating to him,
was causing -'die President trouble.

So they — he said, We

need to enact this law to prevent people from writing to the
President and threatening him.
I do not believe that at the time this law was
passed, that the legislators intended for it to be carried
as far as it’s been carried today, particularly to Mr. George
Kerman Rogers.
The law was passed in a tranquil period of time.
It was first interpreted durixig World War I, when the
atmosphere of the country was somewhat stormy.
The early cases are all very similar, in the other
instances which were prosecuted, to the ones that Mr, George
Herman Rogers made*
I truly believe that had those three men —~ or had
the people or the men in the early cases, had they been tried
today, that they certainly would not be convicted under this
statute for the statements they made.
I think that their utterances towards the President
at the time, Wilson, in no way, under today's interpretations
of the law, would be considered a true threat against the
President of the United States.
This Court has expressed its views on threats or

8
statements or utterances against the President of the United
States on only one occasion, and that was in the case of
Watts vs. United States,
M.»IW «I PH.

that:

< "■■c« I ■»

And in that case this Court said

First of all, there must be a true threat made before

it can be a threat against the President of the United States.
I believe that we're here this morning to try to
define what a true threat is.

I think that this Court must

lay down now guidelines for the fact-finders to determine
what a true threat is, within the meaning of the statute.
The statute was passed to, at that time, what was I
suppose a true threat against the country, and that was that
anybody — the theory was that anybody that spoke out against
the President or against the man in authority was in some way
being disloyal to the United States? was trying to incite
others to maybe carry out the act.

And we don’t believe that

under the First Amendment of the United States, that this lawcan be applied to the facts before the Court.
The First Amendment -—
QUESTION:

Mr. Parnell, are you going to d€.*al with

the suggestion of the Solicitor General that we ought not reach
tiiis question?
MR. PARNELL:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, I'm not.

I —

Well, what's your reaction to it?

Apparently the government is saying they don't want to retry
this man, and that this conviction ought to be set aside.

9
MR. PARNELL?

Certainly, Your Honor, as defense

counsel I would adopt any argument that the Solicitor General
may have towards releasing ray client or acquitting him on any
basis.

I certainly would.
QUESTION:

the subject.

He’s given you a very good opening on

Suppose you address yourself to that question

briefly*
QUESTION:

You didn't ever raise that question

yourself, did you, in the Court of Appeals, or feel it was
sufficient to call either to the attention of the Court of
Appeals or to this Court?
MR* PARNELL:

No, we did not raise that, issue.

It is before — it has been raised for the first time before
this Court.
QUESTION:

Is Mr. Parnell [sic] out on — is he

incarcerated now or is he out on bail?
And has he served any time at all?
MR. PARNELL:
five years.

Your Honor, he was sentenced to

He — the Fifth Circuit expressed some concern

afeot the sentence,
back to three years.

The district court then cut the sentence
He has served sorae two years of that

sentence.
Presently Mr. Rogers is in the hospital being
treated for alcoholism.

As the brief states, Mr. Rogers

has a serious history of chronic alcoholism; has over 100

10

arrests in the past ten years for being

for simple drunk»

Your Honor,» as far as your inquiry as our position
on releasing Mr, Rogers due to the communication that was
directed from the jury to the Court and back to the jury? again
I would say that, of course, we would have no objection whatsoeven if this case turned on that.
QUESTIONS

I would suppose you would support it,

MR. PARNELL:
QUESTION:

However, we feel like ~-

Sir?

I would suppose you would support the

Solicitor General's suggestion,
r

MR, PARNELL:

Yes, very definitely, we vrould support

it in any way,
QUESTION: Well, if you would support it,, and thought
it was of any importance at all, why didn't you raise it,
either to the district court when you found out about it, or
to the Court of Appeals?
MR# PARNELL:

Because we did not find out about it

until —- I would assume until we got to the Court of Appeals,
or even after that,
QUESTION: Well, if you found out about it when you
got to the Court of Appeals, why didn*t you press it there?
MR, PARNELL:

To be honest with you, we felt like

that the issues involved, as far as Mr, Rogers was concerned,
we thought that we had a better argument on the law than with
this technical violation of the other law.

iI

We didn't know about it, to be honest with you»
We did not know that the court had talked to the jury.

We

didn't know it.
QUESTIONS Well, but when the court polled the jury,
you had soma implication of it, hadn’t you?
MR. PARNELL:

We had son» indication then, yes, we

did.
QUESTIONS And you still did nothing about it?
v

MR. PARNELLs

No.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Counsel, suppose we

hear from your friend, and you can reserve some time for
rebuttal, —
MR. PARNELL:

I will be glad to; thank you»

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

— if that seems

desirable to you.
Mr. Tuttle.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN A. TUTTLE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. TUTTLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court s
As counsel has indicated, this is a prosecution
under 18 U.S.C.A. 871 (a), threatening the life of the
President.
The arguments of counsel on appeal have been
principally that the threats uttered were not true threats,

12

or that the trial court misconceived the statute, or, finally,
that if the trial court did not misconceive the statute, the
statute as applied violated th^ First Amendment,
We disagree with all of these contentions»
that the threat was a true threat.
court's instruction was correct.

We believe

We believe the trial
And we believe that the

statute as applied did not offend the First Amendment.
However, as the Court has raised in questions now,
there are some procedural difficulties with this conviction,
which might justify this Court in reversing the conviction.
However, I would stress that these procedural
problem?1 have nothing to do with the facts of the case, the
evidence before the jury, the instructions or the law on the
merits.
In order to understand the facts of the case and the
procedural problem that arose, I would like to elaborate, in
just a few words, some of the facts of the circumstances and
the evidence introduced at trial,
I want to elaborate on that, because I think it's
important to realise that, although, for instance, it is true
that Mre Rogers had a history of alcoholism, every witness
testifying on the matter at trial with respect to the day in
question testified that Mr. Rogers was not drunk at the time
he made the statements in question.
Moreover,; there was expert testimony at trial from a

13
qualified psychiatrist as to the competence of Mr. Rogers at
the time he made these statements.
I'd also like to stress that the record is replete
with threats to "kill the President", to take the life of
the President.

There are counts in which Mr. Rogers —

QUESTION:

Well, were those threats made to any

private individual or were they made to the police?
MR. TUTTLE:

They were made to both, Mr* Justice.

I can give you record citations for —•
QUESTION:

No, no; that’s okay.

MR, TUTTLE:

~~ killings, as — for threats of

killing as they were made to private individuals.
QUESTION:
You interpreted.

Now that I've interrupted you.
Where was he going to kill the President?

MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:
MR, TUTTLE:

He said —
Where?
he was going to do that in Washing­

ton, D. C*
QUESTION: And he was in Shreveport, which is a little
ways away,
MR, TUTTLE:
QUESTION:
MR. TUTTLE:

He was in Shreveport.
Which is a little ways from Washington.
There's no question it's a little ways

-- on the other hand, it's also true that the President
travels in many directions and goes to many States.

14
QUESTION:

Isn’t it also true that when he goes in

those directions, they lock up nuts like him?
MR. TUTTLE:

If there is knowledge of the threat,

and if the Secret Service has adequate advance information,
they would take precautions.
But I do suggest that the President travels widely,
I suggest, for instance, that Shreveport is not very far from
Dallas.
QUESTION:

Did Mr. Rogers say he was going to "walk

to Washington"?
MR* TUTTLE:

He said that, and I construe that as

meaning that he was going to hitch-hike»

Because in the

statement to the police officer, h© said that h© was going to
hitch-hike to Washington, and later on the same officer
testified he said he was going to walk*
In his conversations with a customer, Mr. Buchannan,
he asked about hitch-hiking? and I construe those words to
mean hitch-hiking.

Although, in fact, he did say he was going

to walk.
QUESTION:

And the police did not elect to arrest

him, or take him in custody?
MR. TUTTLE:

The police did in fact take him into

custody, Mr. Justice,
QUESTION:
— any bond?

But didn't they release him without any

15
MR. TUTTLE:

The record i3 not entirely clear on

that. The testimony of the arresting officer is somewhat
at variance with the testimony of the detective at the police
station.
QUESTION:

Did the local —

MR, TUTTLE:

The arresting officer testified that

he was taken to the Veterans Administration Hospital and had
a "hold" placed on him,
QUESTION;
MR. TUTTLE:

Did the local —
Which merely means that the hospital

attendants would notify the police at the time he was to be
released,
QUESTION:

Was any charge lodged against him by the

Shreveport police?
MR, TUTTLE:

No charge was lodged against him,

although the Shreveport police did notify the Secret Service
of tho fact, of this threat, and it was at the behest of the
Secret Service that Mr. Rogers was then arrested,
QUESTION:

Wasn’t it agreed that he hadn't violated

any Louisiana law?
MR, TUTTLE:

I can only testify — I can only

recount what the record states. The record states that no
charge was lodged against him,
Nov?, that may have been an inference on the part of
the police that no Louisiana lav? was violated? or it may have

IS
been a feeling on the part of the Louisiana police that the
crime, if any, was not a crime against the State of Louisiana»
And if it v/as to be punished, should be punished by the federal
authorities„
Again I wish to stress that in many conversations ~~
in several of these conversations, there were in fact threats
to kill 'the President, and they were unconditional threats,
at least in the words given»
When the police officer inquired about the question
of whether there had been threats, the defendant Rogers again
made a threat to kill the President, saying, "I’m going to
Washington, I'm going to beat his ass off? better yet, I'm
going to kill him.”
The police officer testified that he was not scared
by these remarks, but he said he was shook up, because he said
we've had presidential assassinations, and we've had attempted
assassinations, and "I didn't know whether he was mad or
whether he was serious."
All of the witnesses testified that the defendant
appeared serious when he made the statements he mad®,
QUESTION*

By "mad", do you think he meant angry

or crazy?
MR. TUTTLE*

I think —» that would be an inference

on my part, but I would assume he meant crazy.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh

17
MR. TUTTLE:

Of course, a person being crazy

does not necessarily mean that hs*s not a threat to the lives
of other people.
QUESTION:

Mr. Tuttle, your suggestion that this

conviction be set aside is accompanied with a statement that
if it is set aside, the government will not retry him.
Some of the things you were saying seem rather inconsistent
with that determination,
Why is it you wouldn't retry him if we set it
aside?
MR. TUTTLE:

Well, that judgment has been made on

reflection on the facts of the case, on the
QUESTIOM:

It looks as though the government also

thinks he’s a nut, not a real threat.
QUESTION:
MR* TUTTLE:

I suppose the —
Mr. Justice, I didn’t say that anybody

thought he was not a real threat.

That matter was submitted

to —
QUESTION:

I know you didn't.

I'm suggesting that

if that — if you're not going to retry hira, there must be
some element of a judgment that he's in fact a nut and not a
real threat.
QUESTION:

I suppose, also, the government is

taking into account that he has been in prison for two years
or more already.

18

MR. TUTTLE:
two years.

He has been in prison for more than

He’s served his sentence under* the original

judgment of conviction.

And that is a consideration that the

government has taken into account,
QUESTION:

Well, is he still being confined, other

than separately for some alcoholic problem?
MR, TUTTLE:

Well, he is on *»- the sentence included

a five-year conditional sentence of probation, which included,
as a condition thereof, participation in the A.lcoholics
Anonymous program,
QUESTION:
MR. TUTTLE:

Oh, I see.
So the case is not moot.

He has that

constraint.
QUESTION: Well, why would a man who was not under
the influence of alcohol, who wasn’t a drunkard, why was his
probation put on Alcoholics Anonymous?
MR. TUTTLE:

Because the man has a history, a

chronic history of alcoholism.
The question — the question —
QUESTION:

I mean, he's a chronic alcoholic —

\

MR. TUTTLE:

There is evidence to that effect,

And yet there is evidence that he ~
QUESTION:

Well, there must be some tilling wrong with

anybody that goe3 into a jail, I mean a precinct station,
police, and confesses to a crime, that the only way he could

19
commit it was by confessing to it?
MR* TUTTLEs

But the crime we're dealing with» the

crime that presents the background to all of this law and
ou concern» is the crime of presidential assassination? and
I would assume we would all agree that anyone who would even
contemplate such a crime would be, in some sense, unstable.
And in some sense a nut,
QUESTIONs

Well, he'd have to be an awful nut to

go in and confess, wouldn't he?
Wouldn't he be a Grade A nut?
To just go in and say, I insist — and you
emphasized the fact he said over and over again, "I'm going
to kill him? I'm going to kill him? I'm going to kill him»”
He's saying, "Please lock me up and put m© some place", isn't
ho?
I don't understand how you can do that and then
come in and say you're not going to retry him,
MR. TUTTLEs

We're not going to retry him because of

all of the circumstances of the case.

There are circumstances,

Mr. Justice, which I haven't yet mentioned, which include
the fact thatthere is a question in this case as to whether
the jury returned an unconditional verdict.

Thus, we're not

even absolutely sure that we have a fact-finding by a jury
that these were serious threats,
That is another conaideration, in addition to the

20
ones I have already mentioned,
I would like to*, if I may, turn to those particular
circumstances, because they color the question that the Court
is asking, and I think the Court should be aware of the circumstances vrhich lead us to believe that the conviction in this
case may in fact not have been .an unqualified conviction.
After the trial judge instructed the jury, we believe
correctly instructed the jury, the jury deliberated for two
hours and then sent the trial judge a note.

The note asked

the court whether the court would accept a verdict of, quote,
"guilty as charged with extreme mercy of the court".
Upon receiving that note, the trial court, without
consulting counsel, instructed the Marshal that the court's
answer was in the affirmative.
Tills not© and the court’s answer appears at page 52
of the Appendix,
Five minutes after receiving the court's ansv;er, the
jury returned a verdict of guilty in the form I've just
discussed:

guilty as charged with extrema mercy of the court*
Ordinarily it would be the government's view that a

recommendation of mercy of this kind is mere surplusage and
could be discounted and would not affect the validity of the
verdict.
Here, however, we have, in addition to the form of
the verdict, the fact that it was arrived at by a unilateral

21

communication from the district court to the jury.
In our view the juryTs question about whether the
court would accept such a verdict was, in effect, a request
for further instruction? and we think that the proper instruc­
tions to be given under those circumstances would have been:
that the jury has no sentencing function? -that it must reach
its verdict without consideration of the matter of sentence?
and that any recommendation it did make would not be binding
upon the trial court, at the time of sentencing.
Moreover, we believe that before any response is
made, counsel should be informed and counsel should be
heard from.
QUESTION?

I suppose you're suggesting that any

alert defense counsel, in those circumstances, would have
insisted on an unqualified verdict in order, as he would hope,
that this would force a verdict of not guilty?
MR. TUTTLE:

I itfould assume so, Mr. Chief Justice,

because if the jury is talking about mercy, he may feel that
they are taking the possibility of punishment into the account,
to break a deadlock or to resolve a question in favor of
guilt.
And that‘s why we think it’s important that counsel
should be heard from.

And we feel, as a textual matter,

that a response without informing counsel, arguably, or in
fact does deprive the defendant of the right to be present at

22

every stage of the trial# as is guaranteed by Rule 43 of the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
QUESTION:

So# I gather, Mr. Tuttle, the view is

that this falls within the category of plain error which
doesn’t «•- which may be redressed, even though objection was
not made?
MR. TUTTLE:

That is our view, Mr. Justice, and for

the reason that precisely because this was a unilateral
communication to the jury, which counsel was not informed
about, they were not in a position to object to it.

And not

knowing about it, it is hard for us to say that they knowingly
waived any objection that they might have to this circum­
stance.
We pointed out in our original papers on the petition
the form of the verdict, as raising a question all by itself,
and suggested that, arguably, it was waived.

It was in the

preparation of the brief on the merits that we discovered that
in addition to the form of the verdict there was the fact that
it had been arrived at by a unilateral communication from the
judge.
And those two things, taken together, raised in our
mind a substantial question as to whether the verdict was in
fact unqualified.

And we offer those facts for the Court's

consideration»
I am prepared, if the Court desires, to discuss the

23
court's trial instructions# the elements of the offense as
we believe them to be# because we believe the court correctly
instructed the juri?1; and I am prepared# if the Court desires#
to discuss the First Amendment implications of the case»
I would ask the Court whether it has any questions
in any of these areas # or desires to hear from the government
further -»
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You are free to submit

briefs on those questions# counsel, unless there are any
questions from the bench.
QUESTION: Well# I have a good deal of question# Mr.
Chief Justice.

I take it, you're here arguing in support of

affirmance# and there have been First Amendment questions
raised,
I would like to hear your presentation of them.
MR, TUTTLE:

Very well# Mr.

Justice# I am prepared

to proceed with that,
QUESTION:

Well# why wouldn't you?

I've never

heard the government
QUESTION:
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

Nor have I.
— taka a position like this,
Just throwing away the case, in effect,

MR. TUTTLE:

I don't understand your question#

Mr. Justice -» excuse me,
QUESTION;

Well# I was just remarking# I've never

24
heard the Solicitor General’s office take a position like
this in this Court, asking the Court if it has any questions,
and otherwise we won’t, argue the case,
MR, TUTTLE:
QUESTION:
MR, TUTTLE:

Well, Mr. Justice, —
Have you?

Have you heard it before?

Mr, Justice, I apologise if my

suggestion is an inappropriate on© to the Court.
QUESTION:
MR. TUTTLE:

Wfe don’t usually accept cases on briefs.
The reason why I made the suggestion

was merely because w© thought that the case v?ould probably be
disposed of on the ground that we had raised —
QUESTION: Well, it wasn’t.
MR, TUTTLE:

It was not, and therefore I suggested

that I was prepared to proceed, and I apologis® for putting it
in the form of a question rather than a. continuing presentation.
The trial court instructed the jury that the — on
the elements of offense, in stating to the court consistent
with the

in stating to the jury, consistent with the Watts

decision, that only a true threat would be a threat within the
contemplation of the statute, and that a political argument
or idle talk or a jest would not violate the statuto.
On the question of intent, which is the central ques­
tion in the case, the court instructed the jury that a threat
is willful, if the maker voluntarily and intentionally
utters words as a declaration of an apparent intention to carry

25
out. the threat.
The court also used the words, and I'm leaving out
a few words here, that the defendant intentionally made the
threat that a reasonable person would foresee would be
interpreted as a serious expression of intent.
The court instructed the jury that actual intent
to ham was not an element of the offense.
In our view, these are correct instructions.
As we have seen the issue in this case, the issue,
particularly in the light of the verbal conflict amongst the
Circuits, given circulation by the Patillo decision, the
issue is whether the statute requires a subjective intent to
harm the President, or whether the statute prescribes words
which,objectively considered, would appear to be serious.
Petitioner's reply brief, however, does not urge
this distinction, and does not urge that actual harm to the*
President ought to be an element of the offense,

Rather,

they urge that the specific intent required is a specific
intent that the threat be communicated to the President,
We don't think that either of these elements are
in the statute, either by congressional intention or ought
to be construed as a matter of constitutional limitation.
We bfcgin with the words of the statute.

The

words punishes a person who knowingly and willfully makes s
threat to take the life of or inflict bodily harm upon the

26

)

President of the United. States.
The words "knowingly and willfully" t. these adverbs
modify and refer to the act of making the threats and textually,
in any event, do not require that the maker have an inward
desire, either to harm the President or to have the threat
communicated,
We believe that the harm caused by a threat is caused
by the more utterance of th© threat in circumstances where it
would generally be considered serious.

If two persons are

similarly situated and utter the same words, which are apparently
serious threats, the effect of these words is the same, even if
one of them harbors an inward desire to harm the President and
the other does not.
Where a threat is objectively serious, it can’t be
ignored, and requires a response from those charged with the
protection of the President.
In fact, it could endanger the President by diverting
those resources.
If we —• we don't think that the sole purpose ofthe
statute was to prevent ham to the President by convicting
people who threaten to kill the President with an intention to
carry it out.

The House Report on the 1916 bill, which became

the law, states the purpose of the President — states the
purpose of the statute as protecting the President from threats
of violence which would restrain or coerce him in the performance

27
of his duties.
That restraint or coercion,to the extent that it
occurs,

occurs whenever the words are objectively serious.

And that restraint and coercion is neither augmented nor
diminished by the subjective intent of the speaker.

Where

the threat is apparently serious, the Secret Service has to
investigate, and to the extent that it is sidetracked by a
bluff, it is diverted from the supremely serious business of
defending and protecting the life of the President of the
United States,
Our view that the term "willful" refers to the
intent to make the threat, rather than an attempt to harm the
President, is, we believe, supported by the legislative
debate on the bill which became the lav/, which is the
predecessor to 871,
Among the things you will find in that legislature
debate is the discussion of an example of an individual who
finds a document containing a threat and mails it to someone
as a matter of news.
Congressman Volstead urged that the word "willful"
be retained in the statute, in order to assure that such a
person, sending —* knowingly sending such words, but not
intending a threat, would be beyond the scope of the statute.
In our view, therefore, Congress's intent was to
punish one t'/ho knowingly and intentionally makes a threat

28

under circumstances which, objectively viewed, would be
considered serious and sincere*
QUESTION:

I suppose that provision that Mr. Volstead

pressed on the Congress would also protect the newspaper or, a,
in these days , radio or television commentator who repeated
the communication?
MR. TUTTLE s

As a matter of news, ai think that would

fall precisely within that discussion, and that shows the point
of having the words'’knowingly and willfully" in the statute,
in our construction of the statute.
Of course, the statuta does punish th© utterance of
mere words, and therefore has to be weighed against the First
Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech,
QUESTION: Well, before you get to that, Mr, Tuttle?
during the two years h© was in. jail, supposed he’d made the
same threat?

Would he violate the statute?

MR. TUTTLE*

I would have to —» before I could

answer that question — know the circumstances under which they
were mad©.

If th© statement was, "As soon as I get out of

here, I’m going straight to Washington” -*»
QUESTION:

No, sir®

The exact same statements he’s

He repeated them in the jail.

29

MR. TUTTLE:

If he repeated them as a matter of

saying, "I was convicted for the following words", or in
circumstances which led — which the fact-finder —
QUESTION?

Mr. Tuttle, I said he says the exact

same words and nothing elsel
Now, can I get an answer?
MR. TUTTLEs

I would think that those would probably

be words of repetition, of explanation of what he had said
before, and would not constitute a true threat,
But I do believe that a person who is in custody
and under restraint could in fact make a true threat.
In the hypothetical you put, my judgment would be
that that would probably not be a threat,
QUESTION:

Well, haw about now, where he is now, in

a place that's nicely called an alcoholic place?

Suppose he

repeats ‘them there?
And when you leave there, I'm going to take you to
the insane asylum.
Seme place, I think you*re going to say it's not a
threat.

Am I right?
MR. TUTTLEs

That’s correct.

In the example

I gave «— you gave, I suggested it was probably not a true
threat, under the circumstances that you have hypothesized.
Returning for a brief moment to the First Amendment
issue in the case, which we do not consider a serious one.

it has long,; been clear that the First Amendment does not confer
absolute protection for all utterances in all circumstances
and at all times*
Some words, by their very. utterance, create an evil
against which the Legislature can act.
A classic example, and one that shows that the
subjective intent of the maker is not always relevant to the
consequences of speech, is Justice Holmes1 example of a man
who falsely shouts ’’fire" in a theater, and causes a panic.
This Court said, in the Chaplinsky case, there are
certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech,
the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought
to raise serious constitutional problems.
In our view, if there is any such class of speech,
it includes true threats to kill the President of the United
States.
A true threat is not advocacy.
exposition of ideas.

It’s no part of the

It doesn't seek to persuade, and is not

neutralised by a verbal response.

It, thus, does not implicate

the central policy of the First Amendment, which is that speech
can rebut speech and propaganda answer propaganda.
A true threat is punishable because it creates an evil
which Congress can prevent.

As I have indicated, a threat

demands a response from those charged with the President's
protection.

It diverts the resources of that agency, and the

31

process tends to limit the President's activities.

Or, in the

words of the House Report, restrain or coerce him in the
exercise of his constitutional duties.
There is perhaps another consideration.

The federal

laws concerning threats are not limited to threats against the
President of the United States.

18 U.S.C. Section 875 and 876,

for instance, forbids the interstate communication and mailing
of threats to do bodily injury.
Threats of this kind and, I x^rould submit, a fortiori,
threats to do bodily ham to or kill the President of the
United States, are punishable because of the anxiety, the
fear, the turmoil and the potential for violence that they
create, whether or not they are heard by the intended victim.
Advocacy is wholly different, in our view? advocacy
is protected by the Constitution, even when it creates anger
or resentment or uncertainty or unrest.
But threats are different in their consequences.
Threats are different in the emotions they evoke, and in the
anxiety that they create.
QUESTION:

Well, that would be true of a threat

communicated to the target of the threat, but is that —
MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:
against

My — my —
— not necessarily true of a threat

when made to A, B and C?
MR* TUTTLE:

I believe it is.

In fact, we cite in

32

our brief soma cases which have bean decided under the statutes
16vs just mentioned, where the threats have bean communicated
to third parties.

One in the case of a threat to a mother to

harm her son? in another case a call to the FBI with a threat
to kill some third party.
I think tliat these threats do create a climate of
anxiety, particularly a threat to kill the President of the
United States — and, mind you, I'm speaking of a true ~~
QUESTIONS

Isn't that an established procedure,

that whenever such threats come to the notice of local police
they are required to refer them to the FBI and the Secret
Service?
Isn't there something in the report of the Warren
Commission on President Kennedy's assassination to that effect?
MR. TUTTLE:

The Warren Commission Report does

indicate that threats to the President constitute a serious
drain on the resources of the commission, and we feel «—
QUESTION:
MR. TUTTLE:

Of the commission?
I beg your pardon.

I simply misspoke.

A serious drain on the resources of the Secret Service, in

responding to -dies© threats, and investigating them and trying
to determine whether they're serious, And of course, in most
instances, the answer is you cannot cell whether they’re' serious
or not.
In our vievr, threats are simply not part of the area

33
of protected speech.
The Constitution requires that the public debate be
robust and uninhibited and wide open, as this Court said
in the New York Times case.

But there is no place in the

public debate for true threats to commit murder.
The evil against which the statute is aimed is truly
a graves one, and the restrictions which the statute imposes
on speech are quite minor.
To the extent that the statute causes people to
avoid language which might be objectively considered a threat,
we submit that the incursion on protected speech is minor, and
permissible*
I've already indicated —
QUESTION:

Has any court ever taken the view, in

construing thi.3 statute, that it applies only to communica­
tions directed to the President or the other targets?
MR. TUTTLE:

Ho. Very early on, in the very

earliest cases on rulings on demurrers to the indictment,
it

established that there was no requirement, of

communication to the President, and no court has so required,
to the extent that my research has developed*
I thank the Court.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RALPH W* PARNELL, ESQ* ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, very brief,

in reply to counsel* as to — he inferred that the facts are
going to speak for themselves, the record will speak for
itself*
He inferred that Mr, Rogers was hitch-hiking to
Washington, when in fact he was trying to hitch-hike to
Texarkana, where is where the man resided at the time*
He was not arrested by the local police department
in Shreveport.
QUESTION*

What crime could he have been arrested for

in Shreveport?
MRj PARNELLs

Disturbing the peace is as close as

we could pin it down,

MR. PARNELL:
QUESTION:
MR, PARNELL*

Actually killing a President?
To actually kill him, yes*
I believe that*3 correct, Your Honor.

33

Further, counsel x^ould have this class of speech,
in its purist form, the words, "I will kill the President"
thrown out from under the umbrella of the protection of the
First Amendment? where, in his brief on page 19, he says
that "A declaration or announcement, for example, that the
’President must be killed and I will do it* may take on a
different character when made during a political speech,,
It is, to be sure, a crude offensive way for the speaker to
male© his point of politcal opposition»"
We feel like that

Mr. Rogers, on this particular

rainy morning in March, three years ago, was doing no more
than very crudely chastising President Nixon for his trip to
Red China, and that, under the situation, under the circum­
stances, that he was not a true threat to the President of
the United States,

He did not utter a true threat to the

President of the United States,

And certainly should not be

convicted under the statute,
I thank the Court.

QUESTION:

At trial.

Well, but I would have thought this would

have occurred after the trial,
MR. PARNELL:

Yes, Your Honor.

We had ~ we had

two separate — if I may, we had two separate files? we had
the actual record, which was the printed word, or the
transcript of what transpired.

And then we had another file

that had exhibits in it, that were introduced at the trial,
