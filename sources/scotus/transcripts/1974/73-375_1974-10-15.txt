HR. chief JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 73“375, Otte against the United States.
Mr. Karasik, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD KARASIK. ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KARASIK:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
I represent William Otte, the Trustee in Bankruptcy
of Freedomiand, the Petitioner before the Court today.
This case is here on a. writ of certiorari to the
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
The facts of this case are relatively simple.
Freedomiand filed a petition under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy
Act.

It was subsequently adjudicated a bankrupt.
413 priority wage claimants filed proofs of claim

for priority wage claims in the Bankruptcy proceeding during
the six.' month period during which claims could be filed.
The United States Government and the City of New
York did not file any claims for withholding taxes or related
taxes in connection with those priority wage claims.
Ah a matter of fact, they did not file any proofs of
claim pursuant to the "bar order" entered in the proceeding,
which directed the taxing authorities to file proofs of claim
if they had any claims for withholding or related taxes.

4
During the course of the proceeding the bankruptcy
judge entered an order authorizing the bankruptcy trustee to
make a priority wage claim distribution without the necessity
for withholding taxes.
This order was appealed to the District Court, and
the District Court held that it was incumbent upon the
bankruptcy trustee to withhold taxes and that the withheld
taxes were subject to the fourth priority of Section 64a of
the Bankruptcy Act.
On further appeal to the Court of Appeals, the Court
of Appeals held that the withheld taxes were subject to the
second priority under Section 54a of the Bankruptcy Act.
How, the issues before the Court are;
First, whether a bankruptcy trustee is required to
withhold taxes in connection with a priority wage claim
distribution;
Second, whether those withheld taxes are entitled to
a priority?
Third, whether the ruling of the bankruptcy judge
that it was not incumbent upon a bankruptcy trustee to prepare
the VI-2 forma and related forms because it was inconsistent
with the general rule that a bankruptcy trustee need not
incur unnecessary expenses in connection with the administra­
tion of an estate, whether that ruling was clearly erroneous?
and

5

Fourth, whether it was .incumbent upon the taxing
authorities to file proofs of claim in this proceeding or be
barred from asserting their claim in the proceeding.
Essential, absolutely crucial to an understanding
of this case, is that it is a bankruptcy case, it is not a
tax case.

Every appellate court that has dealt with the

issues before the Court today has viewed the issues in terms
of the Internal Revenue Code and has viewed the cases before
them as tax cases.
I submit to the Court that this is a bankruptcy
case, and that if this Court recognizes that it's a bankruptcy
case, that it will overrule all of the appellate courts that
have dealt with the issues before the Court and will overrule
the court below.
Section 64a(2) of the Bankruptcy Act establishes a
priority wage claim for wage earners.
QUESTION:

Uhere is that printed?

HR. KARASIK:
QUESTION:

Not in your brief?

MR. KARASIK;
the Appendix.

It's in the Appendix, Your Honor, --

No, it's not in the brief; it's in

And it's at 94a and. 95.

Now, this Court has dealt with Section 64a(2) in two
significant cases.

The Embassy Restaurant case and the Joint

Industry Board case.
This Court ruled, decided that Congress, when it

6

passed Section 64a(2), attempted to establish an economic
cushion for wage earners who lost their jobs as a result of
their employer's bankruptcy.
Now, I ask this Court, in light of the obvious
congressional purpose related to Section 64a(2), whether
withholding taxes in connection with a priority wage claim
distribution would fulfill that purpose.

I say that it would

not.
Moreover, in interpreting Section 64a(2), this Court
has said that it was incumbent upon, a bankruptcy trustee to
make a prompt distribution of the priority wage claim
dividends.

Yet if a bankruptcy trustee is required to work

out the computations and prepare the W-2's and the 941 's and
the related forms, it is inevitable that there will be a delay
in the distribution, and again I say that any requirement that
would cause a bankruptcy trustee to delay a distribution would
not fulfill the congressional purpose.
QUESTION:

And that brings us —■

Under your theory, Mr. Karasik, would

the employees be nonetheless credited with having paid the
wi til he Id taxes?
MRP KARASIK:
this;

No, Your Honor.

they would receive their money.

The — my theory is
If they owe money to

the government on account of taxes at the end of the year,
they would pay the government./
There would be clerical costs associated with the

7
preparation of the W~2 forms and the related forms.

I don't

know how much there would be, and obviously it would vary from
case to case.

But it would cost something, some clerical

personnel would have to be hired, some accountants would have
to review the computations.
The amount of money that's spent might very well
eat into the amount, of money available for purposes of paying
out the priority wage claim dividend.
QUESTION:

You mean that every time a tax return is

filed, an accountant has to be employed?

Do you do that for

your personal one?
MR. KARASIK:

I retain an accountant in my personal

case, and in this particular case, Your Honor,
QUESTION;

Do you think all taxpayers do?

MR. KARASIK:

No, all taxpayers do not.

bankruptcy trustees do.

But most

In this particular case we have an

accountant. The accountant testified in the court below that
he would ordinarily review the work product of the junior
accountants and any clerical staff that would prepare the
computations and the related forms.
QUESTION s So now you have not only an accountant
but junior accountants also?
MR. KARASIK:
QUESTION:
here.

Well, the District Court —
Suppose there were just one employee

Still an accountant?

8

MR. KARASIKs

It might not have to he an accountant.

But, nevertheless, there would be an expense. And it's possible,
under some circumstances, that the expense would eat into the
amount of money available for ’die priority wage claim dividend.
QUESTION:

That’s true of any cost of administration,

though, isn't it?
MR. KARASIK:

That’s correct.

But this would be an

unnecessary cost of administration, because if no deduction
were made, if the taxpayer, the recipient, the wage earner
actually owed taxes at the end of the year, he would pay it.
Just like every other businessman who happens to receive a
dividend in a bankruptcy proceeding.

There’s no deduction

for that businessman.
QUESTION:

Well, if that were so, why do we have

withholding?
MR. KARASIK:

Withholding applies to the on-going

relationship between an employer and an employee.

The

government wants to collect money at the source, on a pay-asyou-go basis.
QUESTION’:

You think that's the only reason for

withholding?
MR. KARASIK:
withholding.

I think that's idle primary reason for

Unless the government assumes that the ordinary

wage earner is going to default and not make the payment.
I don't believe that's a valid assumption, because

And

QUESTION;

Well, now that you have to assume that,

can’t you assume that a recognizable proportion will, not the
ordinary one?

Wasn't the delinquency of accounts a reason

for withholding as well as currency at the time?
MR. KARASIK:

That may ba, but in this particular

type of situation, that suggestion would be inapplicable,
because all of the priority wage claimants would have filed
proofs of claim in the proceeding. The government would be
completely aware of which people are receiving dividends, and
if these people do not pay taxes,

if taxes turn our to be

due — and they may very well not turn out to be due, because,
after all, you're dealing with wage claimants who receive a
meager amount of money, $600.

If a man who's earning $600

loses his job, perhaps by the end of the year* he may or may
not have gotten a new job.

There may have been a hiatus.

At the end of the year he may awe no taxes whatsoever.
And I submit that it's unfair to deduct taxes when
he receives a priority wage claim dividend.

It’s unfair to

him, and it serves no valid purpose.
The Brookings Institute report,

in its study,

indicates that taxes collected in connection with bankruptcy
proceedings have a miniscule effect on -die treasury?
absolutely miniscule.

But a very significant effect on the

dividends that are paid out in bankruptcy proceedings.
Moreover, as I indicated before, the taxpayer, the

10

wage earner, when he receives money, it's incumbent upon him
to pay a tan: if he owes a fax at the end of the year. And I
submit that the government would lose no morsev if that
procedure were followed in this particular type of case.
QUESTION:

I’m not sure that I follow the theory

behind your comparison that it doesn’t hurt the government
very much, but it does hurt the creditors a great deal.
What’s •— how is that relevant to the issues here?
MR, KARASIK:

Well, any —- I'm just talking generally,

in terms of the Brookings report.

The Brookings report

indicated that taxes, as a general proposition, collected in
bankruptcy proceedings have a miniscule effect on the treasury.
QUESTION:

That's simply because we have a three or

four hundred billion -- I've forgotten what it is now
three or four hundred billion dollar budget.
got to do with the creditor?

But what’s that

Creditors would vary from small

creditors to large, many creditors to few creditors.
MR. KARASIK; Well, I was just suggesting that as* a
general policy.

The revision, the proposed revision of the

Bankruptcy Act suggested by the Brookings Institute, that the
cimount of taxes collected as miniscule, suggested to them that
priority taxes in general should be abolished, in bankruptcy
proceedings.
I'm further submitting that the government will not
really be hurt in this particular case if we follow the

il
suggestion that the trustee is making, that no money be
withheld.

And that -the wage earner, at the end of the year,

if he owes a tax, pays a tax.
Now, the government has recognized that the trustee
might have some difficulty computing the deduction and
accordingly they’ve established a bureaucratic practice that,
as far as I’m concerned, has no basis in lav;, and not subject
to any particular regulation,

hut there is some kind of

practice that the bankruptcy trustee take 25 percent off the
top.
Well, the withholding tax statutes run from 14 per­
cent on upwards.

And I submit that in the kind of cases we’re

talking about, where there are wage earners — and you're not
talking about principals of business or businesses or salaried

personnel, but just wage earners -- that 25 percent is
excessive.
QUESTION: Doesn’t that include Social Security as
well as income tax deduction?
MR. KARASIK:

That’s correct.

That’s the practice.

But even including Social Security at five percent,
you end up with 20 percent as the total deduction.

And. I

submit that the kind of people we’re talking about might not
pay 20 percent, certainly they're not going to be paying 25
percent.
In this particular case you've got 413 people, many

12

of whom are simple day laborers.
they need their money quickly.

They need their money and
And to deduct 25 percent off

the top, or any specific amount off the top, is detrimental
to them and does not fulfill the congressional purpose which
was to establish an economic cushion for these people.
Now, -the court below spoke in terms of control.
That is, that the bankruptcy trustee control the wage claim

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD KARASIK, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KARASIK;

— Resumed

In order for the Court of Appeals

for the Second Circuit to reach the conclusion that a
bankruptcy trustee was required to withhold taxas, it had to
conclude that the bankruptcy trustee was in control of the
v;age claim dividends.

Much like the other appellate courts,

the court below simply ignored the bankruptcy context of this
case.
In point of fact, the bankruptcy trustee does not
control the distribution of wage claim dividends.
bankruptcy judge.

It's the

The bankruptcy judge appoints the trustee,

the bankruptcy judge has the right in certain instances to
remove the trustee? the bankruptcy judge declares the
dividends; the bankruptcy judge must countersign the checks;
and the bankruptcy judge mails out the checks.
So it is not the bankruptcy trustee who is in
control, it’s the bankruptcy judge.
The government says, Well, if it’s the bankruptcy
judge, then perhaps trie bankruptcy judge should withhold the
taxes and prepare the W-2's and the related forms.

14
I say that this is ludicrous, that Congress never
intended the withholding tax statutes to apply to bankruptcy
judges, and that the government is merely trying to force the
issue, as I will show in connection with the priorities»
Each court that -QUESTION s

Why would that be any more true of a

bankruptcy judge than a receiver, for example, in either a
federal or a State proceeding, trustee in bankruptcy?
would it be any more true of the bankruptcy judge?

Why

I don’t

quite get your argument on that.
MR. KARASIK:

Well, the bankruptcy judge -- under

the Internal Revenue Code, it is only the person who is in
control of the payment who is deemed to be the employer, and it
is only the employer who must withhold the tax and prepare the
W-2 forms and the related, forms.
QUESTION:

But there are certain derivative

responsibilities that follow the funds, are there not?
MR. KARASIK:

No.

The Internal Revenue Code speaks

in terms of the parties, not the funds.

It's only the

employer, and the employer who is the one who withholds.
That has nothing to do with the money that's withheld.
Each of -‘die appellate courts dealing with the issues
before the Court has come up with -- well, I shouldn't say
each of them. There have been divergent opinions as to what is
to be done to the taxes that are to be withheld.

15
The government contends that the withheld taxes,
taxes withheld on a second priority are bootstrap to the first
priority.

This is illogical.
And, in addition to that, it's not only illogical,

but it’s contrary to the holding of this Court in the Adair
case.
The withheld funds are taxes -that are withheld from
the employees, they are not expenses of the estate.

And it's

only the expenses of the estate that can be deemed to be
administration expenses and would entitle the government to
priority.
The City of Pew York says, as did -the court below,
that the withheld taxes are entitled to a second priority,
because they are, quote,

carved out of the wages."

Yet this Court, in the Crab as sy Restaurant case, said
that if anything is paid to a third party, to someone other
than the wage claimant, that the moneys that are paid are
not wages fcr purposes of the Bankruptcy Act.
So you cannot conclude that withheld taxes paid to
the government can fall into the second priority.
The Connecticut Motor Lines case says that the with­
held taxes fall into the fourth priority.
Well, the taxes here are not the taxes of title
bankrupt, and the fourth priority only relates to taxes of
the bankrupt.

16
Now, the petitioner does not concede that any taxes
should be withheld at all.

But if taxes are withheld, and if

the taxes do not fall within -the priority category of Section
64a(4) , then perhaps they fall into the proviso that follows
Section. 64a(4) , which says that if a tax is not entitled to a
priority, that it falls into the general unsecured claim
category.
QUESTION: What proviso is that?
MR. KARASIKs

That's the proviso that follows the

priority section under’64a(4) of the Bankruptcy Act,
QUESTION:

I don't find it in the Act.

QUESTION:

It's in the Appendix, is it?

MR. KARASIK:

It's in the Appendix at page 95a.

It says, "Provided,however, that no priority over general
unsecured claims shall pertain to" ~~
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Well, counsel, hold up a

minute until we find the place here.
MR. KARASIK:

Yes.

Excuse me.

QUESTION; The bottom three lines.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR, KARASIK:
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

That:s correct.
Thank you.

Counsel, as I understand it, it's your

position that the wages should be paid in gross?
MR. KARASIK:

That's correct.

17
They are not wages, Your Honor, they're wage claim
dividends.

There’s a significant difference.
QUESTI Oil:

I don’t care what you call them. But,

anyway, you want them paid in gross?
MR. KARASIK:

That’s correct.

But if there is to be a withholding, then, at best,
•the taxes should fall into the unsecured category.
The government will argue that this constitutes a
windfall for the unsecured creditors.

But I submit to the

Court that this is what the statute says.

The Congress, when

it promulgated this particular statute, expected a. certain,
quote, "windfall”, close quote, to unsecured creditors.
At the risk of being repetitious, I say to this
Court that we're dealing with a bankruptcy case and not a
tax case.

When this Cotart dealt, in the Randall case, with

a conflict between the Internal Revenue Code and the Bankruptcy
Act, this Court ruled that in the event of a conflict, the
Bankruptcy Act takes precedence.
And I submit that in this particular case, if the
Court finds that the Bankruptcy Act does take precedence
and I submit ‘that it should find that it takes precedence: -that it will also find the bankruptcy trustee need not
withhold any taxes in connection with priority wage claim
dividends.
QUESTION:

Do you have any authority supporting

10
your position flatly at all?
MR. KARASIKj
QUESTIONS

No.
You have an array of cases internally

inconsistent, first, second, and fourth? but none of them
support your position at this point, do they?
MR. KARASIK: Well, only indirectly.

The Connecticut

Motor Lines case said that if the government failed to file a
proof of claim, that the withheld taxes would be entitled to
a fourth priority, but by virtue of the failure to file a
proof of claim that the taxes would fall into the general
unsecured category.
But. for the general preposition -that a bankruptcy
trustee is not required to withhold taxes, I have no authority
at all, except the Bankruptcy Act.

And I request, and

respectfully submit to this Court, that all of those
appellate decisions which ruled that a bankruptcy trustee
should withhold taxes should be’ overruled.
QUESTION:

Well, what —- do you think that if you

said this tax claim was fourth priority, or unsecured at all,
or not secured at all, or no priority at all, would it
necessarily follow that the trustee would not have to file
a withholding tax return?
MR, KARASIK:
QUESTION:

Well, if there were no wages paid, --

Yes?

MR. KARASIK:

then the trustee would, not have to

19

file any returns.
QUESTION:

These would not constitute wages.
Yes, but when he paid them?

MR. KARASIK: These would he wage claim dividends,
there's
QUESTION: Well, I know, but he's going to be paying
wages, he's going to be paying the $600.
MR. KARASIK:
are not wages.

He's going to be paying $600, but these

He's not an employer.

The recipients are not

his employees.
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but it still could be

held that he's paying wages.
MR. KARASIK:
QUESTION:

And then

If it is held that he's paying wages, -

Yes?

MR. KARASIK:

— then I would assume that it would -—

that he would have to prepare the appropriate forms.
QUESTION; Well, I know, but the people to whom wages
are owed, were owed by the bankrupt, up to $600 are going to
be paid, aren't they?
MR. KARASIK:

That's correct.

QUESTION: The trustee is going to pay them, isn't
he?
MR. KARASIK: Well, the trustee in connection with
the
QUESTION: With the judge.
MR. KARASIK:

-- bankruptcy judge.

Yes.

20

QUESTIONs Well, so those distributions are going to
be made.
MR. KARASIK;
QUESTION:

That's correct.
And I suppose you could say -that the

trustee can withhold them, can withhold the money.
MR. KARASIK:

Well, .if •— there are several threshold

questions — if we're talking about a wage, and if you're
saying that the bankruptcy trustee is the one in control, then
~~ and if you're further saying that the Internal Revenue Code
comes into play at this point ~~
QUESTION;

Well, certainly the claims that are going

to be filed and paid are wage claims.
MR. KARASIK;

The claims are wage claims. What is

paid is a wage claim dividend.
QUESTION;

Yes, and it's —

MR. KARASIK;

And there's a difference, X submit

respectfully, between a wage claim dividend and a wage.
QUESTION;

Well, if all a fellow was owed was

his wages?

Well, don't you usually pay wages, wage

21
MR, KARASIK;

We attempt to do it.

In this

particular case there was a hiatus between the date of
adjudication and the date of payment.
The reason for that is that, first, the estate must
be liquidated.

Second, as in this particular case, there

were liens that had to be invalidated.

And third, in this

particular case, the attorney who was handling the case took
i'll.

He was ill for several years, and then died,

unfortunately.
QUESTION; But if you're right that these wage
claims, that these tax claims might be — have no priority at

would go into the unsecured ~~
MR. KARASIK;

That's correct.

QUESTION;

unsecured creditor

MR. KARASIK:

And that's illogical, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Well, that's your claim, though.

MR. KARASIK:

Well, it's not my claim. The

illogicality of that, and the fact that you have so many
divergent opinions as to what is to be done with the withheld
taxes demonstrates to me, and I hope to the Court, that
Congress never contemplated that withholding taxes would be
applicable in a situation such as the one at bar.
If there are no further questions, I respectfully
reserve my time for rebuttal.

22
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well.

Mr. Jones.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEITH A. JONES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF TIIE RESPONDENT UNITED STATES
MR. JONES;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court;
I represent the United States in this case.

Mr.

Warms, who will follow me, represents the City of New York.
Three related questions are presented here;
First, whether a trustee in bankruptcy must withhold
income and Social Security taxes on the distribution of wage
claims.
Second, whether the taxing authorities must file
formal proofs of claims with respect to these withholding
taxes’.
And third, whether such taxes are entitled to first
priority of payment or payable in some other manner under the
Bankruptcy Act.
As to the first question, the trustee’s duty to
withhold, notwithstanding the trustee’s arguments here, the
law is quite clear.

The Internal Revenue Code, squarely

requires the trustee in bankruptcy to withhold federal income
and Social Security taxes on all wage claim distributions, and
to prepare and. submit appropriate information returns and
reports to the Internal Revenue Service and to the wage

23
claimants.
The evidence in this case shows that, contrary to
the petitioner's position, the cost of complying with these
withholding and reporting requirements are trivial; and, in
any event, even if the costs were more substantial, they would
not justify the trustee's failure to perform his statutory
duty.
Our arguments to this effect are set forth in our
brief, and,if there are no questions on this point, in the
interest of time, X will go on to the ocher questions in this
case.
As to the second question in -this case, the filings
of proofs of claims, we believe that it is also clear that no
filings of proofs of claims are required with respect to
withholding taxes that arise after bankruptcy, as in this case.
The Bankruptcy Act requires the filing of formal
proofs of claims only with respect to debts for which the
bankrupt is or may be liable, and the bankrupt will neverbecome liable for the withholding taxes in this case.
These taxes arise only after bankruptcy and they are
obligations incurred by the estate in the course of
administration, and not by the bankrupt.
In this respect, they are just like the expenses
incurred by the trustee in employing clerical assistants to
help administer the estate.

Indeed, they are just like the

24

costs incurred by the trustee in conducting this litigation.
Withholding taxes.- like other expenses incurred in the course
of administration, are obligations of the State, which

as

I say, which are incurred in the course of the administration,
and the Bankruptcy Act does not require the filing of proofs
of claims with respect to such debts of the estate, as
distinguished from debts of the bankrupt.
Moreover, the purpose of filing proofs of claims
is simply to inform the bankruptcy court, the trustee, and the
other creditors of the total amount of claims outstanding
against the bankrupt.
Proofs of claims of withholding taxes here in
question would not serve that purpose.

These withholding

taxes do not add to the testa 1 amount of claims against the
bankrupt or the estate, they arise only when -the wage claims
are paid out.

They’re deducted from the wage claims, paid

over to the United States, and they don’t reduce the fund
remaining for payment to other creditors.
Therefore, filing proofs of claims would serve no
purpose under the Bankruptcy Act.
Moreover, any filing requirement of that kind for
the government would be impracticable.

As we showed in our

brief, the Bankruptcy Act requires proofs of claims to be
filed as to debts of the bankrupt within six months of the
first date set for the first meeting of creditors.

25

No taxing authority could comply fully with that
requirement.
Until the expiration of the six-month period, it
would be impossible to know just haw much wage claims in fact
were to be payable out of the estate.
Moreover, the actual amount of the tax that would be
diia cannot be known until the actual amount of wages has been
calculated and distributed.

Because withholding rates

fluctuate over time., and the effective withholding rates at
the time of bankruptcy may be very different from those that
are in effect at the time of the distribution of the wage
claims,
Therefore, for all these reasons, we believe it's
clear that Congress did not intend to require the filings of
proofs of claims with respect to these withholding taxes.
With that in mind, I now turn to what we believe is
the most important and substantial question in this case, and
that is the priority to which the United States is entitled or,
more generally, the manner in which these withholding taxes
are to be paid over to the United States.
Under Section 7501 of the Internal Revenue Code, an
obligation is imposed upon all persons responsible for
collecting taxes to hold those taxes in a special fund in
trust for the United States,

Under that provision, withholding

taxes of the kind here in question, *orf indeed, any other

26
withholding taxes, are directly payable to the United States
as a trust fund, without regard to the provisions of the
Bankruptcy Act.
However, the trustee in this case has not complied
with Section 7501.

And we recognize that under this Court's

holding in United States v, Randall the trustee's duty to
pay over cannot be enforced as against third-party creditors.
The issue that arises in this case, therefore, is to what
priority of payment, if any, the United States is entitled,
when the trustee defaults on his duty to pay over the with­
holding taxes as a trust fund.
And I turn now to that question.
Cur position, simply put, is that the United States
is entitled to payment of these withholding taxes as first
priority administrative costs and expenses.

We reach this

conclusion both because such withholding taxes analytically
fall within the category of administrative expenses, and
also because they don't fit within any other priority or,
indeed, non-priority category.

MR. JONES:

We're supporting the judgment below

QUESTION:

Well, did you petition, or not?

MR. JONES:

We didn't petition, but, as we pointed out

in our brief, the question of first priority was opened up by
the petitioner in his petition.

The question presented in

the petition — and I will read it to the Court — is whether
— this is Question No. 2 at page 2 of the petition:
"Assuming arguendo that such a distribution is
subject to the withholding tax and reporting requirements of
the Internal Revenue Code", et cetera, "should the monies
withheld in connection with the' distribution be accorded fourth
priority 'tax claim*

status

..., first priority 'administration

28
QUESTION;

Well, of course, it goes further than

that, doesn't it, Mr. Jones, it isn't just a question of what
may be raised here, but it's a question of whether, if you
want to get a more favorable result than the Second Circuit
gave you, whether you. don't have tc cross-petition?
MR. JONES3

Well, I don't think that's true in

tills case, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

On that point I ’would say

that since the question in this case is how trie moneys are
distributable, necessarily the Court has to consider whether
the taxes are first priority items.
Now, I would say that if the question were not
properly before the Court, were not presented by the petitioner,
then we would be entitled, at most, to an affirmance of the
judgment below; although we might also be entitled to a ruling
that, as a matter of law, such taxes are first priorityclaims .

QUESTION:

.Sub dicta —

MR, JONESz

In other words, you could, if you saw

fit, determine that as a matter of law these withholding
taxes are first priority items.

But that, in the absence of

a cross-petition, we were entitled only to an affirmance of
the judgment below.
In this case in would be perfectly satisfied by
such an affirmance, because the distribution of assets in this
case is the same, whether it's a first priority or a second

That is, as I say, I think that in this case, under
the peculiar circumstances where the question necessarily is
presented to the Court in the petition, by tee question raised
by the petitioner, that it's open to the Court to consider it
and dispose of it.

That's correct.
Mr. Jones, to over-simplify, sup-pose

you got a judgment for $15,000 in the Court of Appeals, and
the other side brought it up and you didn't cross-petition,

No.

And we have spelled out our

position at greater length on this point.

In our reply brief in the Western

Addition case, which was filed last week.
QUESTION;

Well, the fact is- if yon look at the

petition for certiorari in this question, Question 2 does
embrace the question that you’ve raised.
MR. JONES;

That’s correct.

And it was in reliance

upon that that we acquiesced in this petition.
QUESTION; And we granted certiorari across the board.
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
-- implicitly accepting the proposition

that these questions were raised.
MR, JONES: And for that reason we believe that, this
case really doesn’t even present the issue that we discuss in
our reply brief in Western Addition.

Because we think that

this issue is before the Court and can be adjudicated in our
favor, and the judgment modified — the judgment below
modified.
QUESTION:

The two basic questions are, Are these

wage claim dividends subject to — does the trustee have the
duty to withhold at all?

And, secondly, if he does, what

priority, if any, do they fall into?
MR. JONES:

That’s correct.

QUESTION: Would you expand for me the government’s
theory as to why they should be first priority?
MR. JONES:

Yes, Mr. Justice Blackxnun, I would be

32
As I've already indicated —QUESTION;

As contrasted with the Second Circuit's

conclusion that they would derive from wages and thereto ire
would belong in the second priority.
MR. JONES;

That’s right.

Well, in the first place, this is, as I've already
indicated, an expense that's incurred by the estate in the
course of administration.

And it seems clear to us that such

expenses are administrative expenses, entitled to first
priority.
QUESTION;

Now, why is that? What is the estate

for it, as contrasted, say, with the trustee's fees or some­
thing of this kind?
MR. JONES;

Well, these are very much like the

expenses of hiring secretaries to mail out the wage
distributions, the estate really doesn't, get anything for it,
it's just an obligation that it incurs in the course of the
adminis tration.
QUESTION; Well, I'll buy the obligation part, but
I wonder why it is a cost of administration.
MR, JONES;

Why, if it's an obligation and it's

incurred, I'm not sure why it wouldn't be cost.
QUESTION;

I think the first priority originated

in the Eighth Circuit Fogarty case, did it not?
MR. JONES;

That's correct.

And I look at this, this was a tag-end

as the validity of —
HR. JONES:

That's right.

The court, of course,

did not devote much time to this issue.
QUESTION:

the tax, and all that I see that Judge

Woodruff said is that the taxes should be allowed and
classified as an expense of administration having priority?
they were not payable at the time the petition was filed by
the bankrupt and only accrued as and when paid.

That is,

on the actual payment of 25 percent of the wage claims during
the administration of the estate, pursuant to the orders of
the bankruptcy court.
Well, I don't find much reasoning in that.

It merely

says that it was paid pursuant to an order of the Court,
therefore it's a cost of administration.
MR. JONES:

Well, we're not relying necessarily upon

the reasoning as set forth in the Fogarty opinion.
QUESTION:

I would just like to know what reasoning,

then, you are relying on?
MR. JONES:

Well, I'm not sure exactly what your

question is, Mr. Justice Blackiaun.

You're distinguishing

between cost and taxes, it seems to me, and it's clear that
the taxes incurred in the course of administration are first
priority items, whether or not they are of any substantial

34
value to the estate.
I would quote,, with regard to that, from Collier on
Bankruptcy, paragraph 62.14[3], and I quote*
"To the extent to which a receiver or trustee is
under a duty to pay taxes, his expenses or tax liabilities
are to be classified as necessary to the cost of operation,
preservation, or administration, and within the first
priority.M
In other words, these are items, expense items, taxes,
however you describe them, they are obligations that are
incurred in the course of administration.
QUESTION:

Is that Collier speaking, or are there

some cases to support it?
MR. JONES:

That's Collier speaking.

many cases to support it.

There are

lie addresses -- he’s there addressing

the question of whether administration expenses have to be
preservation costs, and he points out that clearly they do not,
that what you1 re concerned about in the first priority
administration expensas are the'broad category of expenditures
that are made by the trustee without regard to whether they
may be directly related to the preservation or development
of the estate.

That statement is also directed at

taxes which accrue during the administration, —

QUESTION;

And, arguably, these taxes or these

withholdings ought to be treated like real property taxes that

MR. JONES:

No, Mr. Justice White, -they can't be

owing before bankruptcy.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL J, WARMS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT, THE CITY OF NEW YORK
MR. WARMS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
I shall confine my argument to the priorities
question, and support the holding of the court below, which
held that the withholding tax claims in question were wage
claims.
Now, while the United States Government’s argument
suits our book as well, we would fare just as well, the
distribution would be precisely that which was ordered by the
court below, we feel that the court's position, which was our
position tiiere and is our position here, is the more logical

diminution in the amount of tax claims.
Now, they set that forth in a very complicated
example on page 40 and page 41 of their brief.

QUESTION:

So wherever there’s not enough assets to

pay the wage claims, they would suffer, too, if the Court of
Appeals had -MR. WARMS:

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Well, that's what their claim is.

MR. WARMS:

That's their claim, but I've analysed

the argument and I've analyzed the example.
What they say is this, if in a State where there is
$40,000 worth of wage claims, there are only $20,000 to pay
them, they would be paid in this way.
QUESTION:

Yes. Well, let me — you would say that

as far as you can see it doesn't make that much difference
to the State, or to the city?
MR. WARMS:

I would say it doesn't make any

difference, because in such a case -the residue would be paid,
if we assume 25 percent as the rate, 75 percent to the wage
earner and 25 percent, on his behalf, to 'die government?
not half of 25 percent, as they argue in their brief.
QUESTION:

I see.

QUESTION:

But, nonetheless, it's 25 percent of a

smaller amount than the total wages claimed, isn't it?
MR. WARMS:

Well, that would be true in any case,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:
paid out.

In other words, you tax only what is

39

MR. WARMS:

That’s correct, sir.

The withholding

is based on the actual gross amount of the wage distribution.
QUESTION:

But so far as net receipts to the

treasury is concerned, if you pay $100,000 on $100,000 wage
claim and subtract 25 percent for tax, the government is
getting more money than it would if you pay $50,000 on
$100,000 wage claim and paid twelve-five to the government.
MR. WARMS:
Rehnquist.

That's absolutely correct, Mr. Justice

Because the wage claimants are getting half,

the wage claimants are getting less than the $50,000.
QUESTION:

Well, in his last example, the only

thing that would be administration expense would be 2$ percent
of $50,000.
MR. WARMS:
QUESTION:

Hi at is correct, Your Honor.
And so it wouldn't —■ and you say that

wouldn't make —• so it wouldn't make any difference.
MR. WARMS:

It. wouldn't make the slightest bit of

difference.
You see, the government's example indicates that that
25 percent of the $50,000 would be. cut in half, because it's
a 50 percent dividend.

It wouldn't be, it would be calculated

on the amount of each wage paid.
New, another reason why we prefer our argument is
that it avoids the trustee's argument that an administrationexpense must be in preservation of the estate or in connection

40

with the acquisition of assets,

lie don’t have to argue against

that in presenting it as a second wage •*— a second priority
wage claim.
Now, I'd like to advert to some of Mr. Justice
Blackmun's questioning concerning the Fogarty case, because
that was the leading case, and that was the case from which
sprung this notion of administration expense priority»
Actually, I'm not sure that the Fogarty case wasn't
correct.

Because, in the Fogarty case, there was no with­

holding, as far as we can see.

I believe the wage distribu­

tions were made without any withholding of tax.

And that the

taxes were actually satisfied by offsetting them against the
claim which the bankrupt had against the government for some
ships it had built.
Nov;, that means, probably, that they were rightly
decided to be administration expenses, because they weren't
carved out of the wages.
wage claimants.

The wages went 100 percent to the

The other came out of the estate.

And so, although -the case was followed in Lines v.
California and. in the Curtis case in the Ninth and Sixth
Circuits, which both, held that administration expense status
was accorded these claims, I think we should bear in mind
that Fogarty, which was the father of all of these cases, is
perhaps reconcilable with our view in this case.
Nov/, we say that the wage claim status depends on

this.

Withholding taxes are derived from and carved out of

the actual wages paid to an employee and the wage distribution
paid to a wage claimant.
?

There is if thex"e were an inevis am assignment by
idie wage claimant to the governments involved, of that part
of his wages which might reasonably be assumed to cover his
taxes.

The minute these taxes are withheld he gets a credit

on the books of the governments for these withholdings.
If he in other respects has satisfied his tax
indebtedness, if, for example, he's made estimates, he'll get
those withholdings back in the form of a refund; so he will
ultimately realize, in that case, what are essentially his
wages.

lie’s required to include them in his gross income,

in his income tax return, and this shows, too, that the amount
of the withholding is part of his salary and therefore are
wages.
QUESTION;

Mr. Warms, this second priority theory,

which I think emerged for the first time in this case in the
Second Circuit, was this your argument below or did die court
pick it up on its own theorizing or —
MR. WARMS:
argument.

I'm sorry to say that it was my

I say that because it makes me appear to be very

vain to try to support it in the case where I need not
necessarily do so.
But it was, indeed, my argument, and the court was

42

very kind in flattering me about it.
Part of that argument also was that if proper
segregation were made of these funds,, they would also enjoy a
trust fund status within the second

within the range of

the second priority.
Mow# I’ve spoken about what I consider to be the
unfounded fears of the federal government in the event that
second priority status is accorded to these wage claims.
Finally, X think I should point out that there is an
anomaly in computing them, if they're to be considered
administration expenses, because administration expenses have
to be computed before you can determine how much money is
left in an estate to pay wage claims.
And it’s only after you've determined how many -how much you will have left for wage claims that you can
compute the taxes on them.
QUESTION;

Mr. Warms, have you ever studied

calculus or differential equations?
MR. WARMS s

No, Your Honor, I haven't, and I was

wondering whether this was a case of a multiple variable -~
I've heard that term.
QUESTION; Well, it just seems to me here you have
two dependent variables with one constant, which you've
forgotten, to wit, the amount of money.
MR. WARMS:

That's correct.

QUESTIONj And I think it's a routine problem in
either differential equations or calculus, integral calculus,
if you wish; so I don't go along with this argument, I'll be
frank to say, that it is capable of solution, I'm sure»
MR. WARMS:

Oh, just as the problem of the employer

who pays the income tax on the employee's income is capable
of solution.
QUESTION:

Sure.

MR, WARMS:

In a similar manner, I think.
