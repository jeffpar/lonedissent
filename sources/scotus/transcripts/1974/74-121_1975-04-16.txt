Hr. Quaid, I think you may now proceed whenever you

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS E, QUAID ON BEHALF
OF THE PETITIONER
MR, QUAIDs
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

This case comas before the Court to review the

judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit reversing the district court’s order affirming the
bankruptcy court's finding that it had summary jurisdiction
over the controversy before it and adjudicating that controversy
in favor of the receiver in bankruptcy over the United States
and its claim to a tax lien.
The case arose in the year 1971 when the Internal
Revenue Service made four assessments of taxes against
Chicagoland Ideal Cleaners Company, the first in March and
the last in June of 1971.

Thereafter the directors of the

taxpayer made a general assignment for the benefit of creditors
on June 28 of 1971.

Two months later the Internal Revenue

Service filed, or recorded, its Notice of Tax Lien with the
Recorder of Deeds for Cook County, and on the same day served
a notice of tax levy upon the assignee for the benefit of
creditors.

Sometime thereafter an involuntary petition for

4
bankruptcy was filed against Chicagoland Idee! Cleaners, the
company was adjudicated, a receiver appointed, and the
petition which initiated this proceeding filed*
The petitioner feels that the essential question
presented in this case is the one of jurisdiction,

the

summary jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court to proceed to the
merits of the controversy before it.
We feel that there are three independent and alternative
bases of summary jurisdiction for the bankruptcy court in this
case.

The first is section 2a(21) of the Bankruptcy Act,

and the second is section 70a(3) also of the Bankruptcy Act.
Although slightly different, we believe that they stand for the
same principle, that the bankruptcy court enjoys and can
exercise summary jurisdiction over an assignee for the benefit
of creditors and properly in his hands the bankruptcy court,
being of course a court which proceeds in rem, we believe
that having summary jurisdiction over the assignee and the
property in the possession of the assignee, the bankruptcy
court can go on to adjudicate property rights and interests in
the property which it has gained summary jurisdiction over.
QUESTION:

The property we are talking about is

money in a bank account?
MR. QUAIDj

Well, the property initially started out

as tangible property, being the fixtures and equipment of the
bankrupt, the Chicagoland Xdeel Cleaners.

The assignee

5
liquidated by sale? pursuant to a power of sale contained
within the assignment, that equipment and fixtures, he reduced
it to cash.

And when the levy was served it was cash, but

before then, and during the time when the assessments existed,
it did consist of tangible personal property and was capable
of physical seizure at that time.
QUESTIONS

It does make some difference, doesn’t it,

as to whether the property is a pure intangible or whether,
as you say, it's personal property subject to reduction to
possession or seizure?
MR. QUAIDs

Well, the courts have recognized

a difference, whether it's tangible or intangible property,
personal property.

And we feel that if the Government had

actsd to assert its rights mors promptly when it was tangible
personal property, tills would have been an entirely different
case.
However, notwithstanding that fact, even when it
was intangible property, we feel that the Government really
never acted promptly to perfect its rights and reduce what
there was to its possession.

Sven if it's intangible property

cash in a bank account, they still can compel the turnover of
that money to them if they went forward with their rights.
QUESTION;

Can they actually not merely levy on a

bank account, but force the bank to turn over the money to
them physically in the face of an adverse claim by the person

6

who says, "I don't owe the Government"?
MR. QUAIDs

Well, I believe the Government is making

that claim in this case that once they serve their levy, they
seem to feel that they have ownership, not only possession, but
actually ownership of these funds and the power to require
anyone to turn it over to them under pain of penalty.
QUESTION:

It's perfectly clear that once it's

served, the bank is not supposed to let it out of its possession
or to pay the money to anybody else, as a matter of Federal
law, isn't it?
MR, QUAXD:
QUESTION:
MR. QUAXDi

True,

Yes.

So it's effectively sterilized.
Well, it's frozen until there is a

determination, if there is any contest of ownership or rights
in the property.
QUESTION:

That is, upon the service of the Notice

of Levy.
MR. QUAXD;
QUESTIONs

Yes, sir.
In that respect it's something like a

jeopardy assessment in a tasc case, isn't it?
MR. QUAIDs

Well, I think it performs a different

function, although it does ask to preserve whatever rights
the Government would have in it and protect those rights,
QUESTION:

It preserves not only the right, but it

preserves the resource to satisfy the claim —

ME» OUAIDs

Well, that’s correct.

QUESTIONS

which is the function of the jeopardy

assessment, in part at least, isn’t it?
MR. QUAID:
QUESTION?

Yes, it is.
Aren’t we really talking about the place

where the merits of the controversy should foe determined,
whether by the referee on the one hand
in court on the other?
MR. QUAID:

or a, plenary proceeding

Isn’t this the argument?
Yes.

The question is one of jurisdiction,

who should decide it, the referee or another court, the
district court, in a plenary proceeding- although the merits
of the controversy in a question of the summary jurisdiction
of a bankruptcy court, at least in part, enter into, the merits
enter into the determination of the summary jurisdiction, as
I think is adequately revealed in the briefs on the part of
both parties.
But what we are dealing with is a case where you
have an assignee for the benefit of creditors who is holding
the funds.

The Bankruptcy Act makes special provision and

special rights of the bankruptcy representatives to that
assignee.

In section 2a{21), suramary jurisdiction, or at least

jurisdiction, i3 given over that representative which this
Court has held to be summary in nature in order to provide
a prompt and expeditious remedy for the bankruptcy
to reach whatever property or assets are in the hand

trustee
of the

8
assignee.

And also section 70a goes on to give sumraary juris­

diction by creating a theory or a fiction that the assignee is
a mare agent or bailee for the purpose of the exercise of
summary jurisdiction to enable the bankruptcy representative
to reach the property.
The third basis, and the one which is the heart of
this case, is whether there is constructive possession by the
bankruptcy court supporting its summary jurisdiction.

And

again we have to go back to the special relationship which has
been created in the Bankruptcy Act which gives the bankruptcy
representative these powers to compel a turnover on the part
of an assignee for the benefit of creditors of whatever property
or assets

he has in his hand to reduce the delay and the

cost of the bankruptcy proceedings and to simplify and ease
their administration for the benefit of all creditors.
Now, tine United States claims that they obtained
constructive possession due to the service of their Notice of
Levy upon the assignee for the benefit of creditors.

I would

contend that constructive possession in this case, due to the
nature of the relationship provided by the Bankruptcy Act over
the assignee went to the bankruptcy court upon the filing of
the bankruptcy petition, and that the Government would have to
show its actual possession of the funds in question or the
property before the liquidation in order to defeat this one
basis of the court's summary jurisdiction.

The levy does not

9
give to the United States actual possession of the funds.
There are soma cases saying; that, it's a seisure of a property
interest.

The case of the United States v. Siland says that

it was in a transfer of ownership of the asset.

In that case

it was a pure debt, it shows an action, and there is no
tangible property involved.
But in this case we feel that these cases are not
well founded and that the case in fact cited in the Government’s
brief of In Re Brewster-Raymond Corporation correctly sets forth
the better rule that the service cf the levy, even upon what
the Government claims was their Federal tax lien, perfects
the property interest of the Government in the property.
QUESTIONS

What if you had in the possession of the

assignee for the benefit, of creditors while he was conducting
a mercantile operation property on consignment from a third
party which under State law?, the third party’s right would
prevail over the assignee.

Not*?, would you say that the

bankruptcy court would have summary jurisdiction to adjudicate
title to that kind of property?
MR. QUAID:

I would say that

it would, but that is

a different situation because here what we have is a tax lien
which under section 67 is postponed to the costs of
administration and priority wage claims.

In the situation

that you suggest, you have a different situation where there
is no postponement provision, no subordination of the lien

10
to any of the priorities of section 64 of the Bankruptcy Act»
QUESTIONS

Any property that's physically in the

possession of the assignee, even though he doesn't assert any
ownership claim to it, becomes subject to the summary jurisdic­
tion of the bankruptcy court?
MR. QU&ID:
QUESTION:

I would believe so, yes.
That is property of the bankrupt, formerly

of the bankrupt —
MR. QUAIDs
QUESTION:
MR. QU&ID:

Yes.
— assigned to the assignee.
Of course, on a consignment situation,

you would not have «a question of a lien, but you would have a
question of title residing in the consignor.
QUESTION:

Generally that would be the property of

the bankrupt still, would it not, if he were only a consignor,
rather than assignee?
MR. QUAID:
QUESTION:

Well, I would say that —
Assignor, I mean.

If he were a consignor

rather than assignor, he would still have the property,
wouldn't he?
MR. QUAID:

I don't believe he would have title to

the property, he would only have the right to sell it subject
to the authority of the consignor.

The consignee would not

have title to it.
QUESTION:

No.

The consignor would.

11
MR. QUAID:

Yes.

QUESTION.»

Right.

QUESTION:

Then, you read section ?Qa of the Act,

at subsection (8), which appears on page 5a of your brief where
it says "property held by an assignee for the benefit of
creditors," you read "assignee for the benefit of creditors"
very broadly as not modifying property at all, so that any
property held by an assignee for the benefit of creditors
regardless of whom the property belongs to becomes subject to
the summary jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court?
MR. QUAID:

I believe that it would become subject

to the summary jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court, but I
think that in that case the rights of the third party would
probably prevail and be superior to that of the bankruptcy
representative.
QUESTION:

But that would be decided by the

bankruptcy court.
MR. QUAID:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Well, supposing I am the assignee for the

benefit of creditors of Joe Dcakes who becomes a bankrupt
and 2 have a chair in my house that never belonged to Joe
Dcakes, it5s nonetheless held by roe.

Is that subject to the

summary jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court?
MR. QUAID:

I think the question is who is the

f
v.. v ■

proper

party, or proper court to decide these questions.

12

tod I think: that if the bankruptcy representative, the claim
of any party to title or lien to property, either in the
ir

possession of assignee for the benefit of creditors of someone
who is now bankrupt, if that had

to be a plenary proceeding

on every such claim, then a very heavy burden would be cast
upon the administration of bankruptcy estates.
QUESTION?

So possession by the assignee confers

the same sort of summary jurisdiction in the bankruptcy court
as possession by the bankrupt does?
MR. QUAID:

It's a different situation because the

Bankruptcy Act creates special provision for the assignee for
the benefit of creditors.

But if we become .involved with the

tas: lien and the levy at this point where the levy upon the
property in the hands of the bankrupt would give to the United
States greater rights than it does upon,a levy upon the
assignee for the benefit of creditors.
QUESTION?

The United States claims that once it

serves its levy, the assignee isn't holding it any longer for
the general benefit of creditors.
I®. QUAID;

Well, they claim that and that is the

point that we dispute.
QUESTION:

I suppose you would concede that if the

assignee for the benefit of creditors took possession of a
piece of property that had been mortgaged by the bankrupt to
his creditor

in which the bankrupt claims some equity and the

13
mortgagee then repossessed the property, took it from the
assignee for the benefit of creditors and held it under a
claim of right under his right to foreclose, that the bankruptcy
court would have no summary jurisdiction over that property
and over the claim of the secured creditor.
MR. QUAID:

In that case the property would be in the

actual possession of the mortgagee.
QUESTION:

I know, but it was, had been and was in

the possession of the assignee.
MR. QUAXD:
QUESTION:

Yes, but it no longer is.
And the United States claims that the lien,

the levy achieves that very same purpose.
HR. QUMD:
QUESTION:
MR. QUAID:

Well, that is the point that we contest.
That’s the Issue.
Yes, it is.

We feel that the levy does not transfer ownership
to the Government, but it merely perfects their right, their
property interest in the property now in the hand3 of the
assignee for the benefit of creditors.
As I mentioned in the case In Re Brewster-Raymond
where there is a tax lien upon the bankrupt prior to
bankruptcy and a levy upon a debtor of the bankrupt, the court
held that the property was still subject to the administration
of the bankruptcy court

and the bankruptcy estate.

We feel

that this is the better decision in that it gives effect to

bringing together the decision-making powers in the bankruptcy
court who is the court that is going to administer the assets
of the bankrupt in these proceedings and. a court who is
familiar with those problems and will also serve to protect
the costs of administration and the priority wage claim that
Congress is seeking to protect,
How, the Government is claiming in this case a

aiid

tax lien upon the property or rights to property of Chicageland
Ideel Cleaners,

We do not believe that they did have a valid

tax lien since the lien attaches to property or a right to
property belonging to the taxpayer with the assignment by
Chioagoland Ideel Cleaners to the assignee for the benefit of
creditors.

There was a trust created for the benefit of all

creditors.

The assignor no longer had any property interest

in the property and that there was a transformation of the
assets of the property at that time which deprived the tax
lien of any property or right to property belonging to the
taxpayer upon which it could attach*

We believe that this

principle has been recognised in the case of United States v.
Bess where they held that a tax lien existing upon a taxpayer
did not attach to the proceeds of his life insurance policy
after his death, did not attach to the full face value of that
policy but rather only to the cash surrender value, which was
a fund which was being accumulated and held to him and which
he could have reached

15
In this case, after the assignment, the only
interest remaining in Chicagoland Ideal Cleaners was the
possibility that there be an excess in the value of the property
which he had assigned over his total indebtedness.

And in

this case where the Government’s tax lien is in the sum of
$141,000 and is only one claim against the estate and the
proceeds of the sale of the bankrupt property amounted to
just over $31,000, there was obviously no reverter interest
which could have come back to the taxpayer, the assignor,
Chicagoland Ideel Cleaners.
QUESTION:

Let me see if I understand you then.

It's your position that this subordinates the tax collector
to the general creditors.
MR. QUAID: It subordinates him to the costs of the
bankruptcy administration and priority wage claims.
QUESTION:
MR. QUAID5

But not other creditors.
No, not other creditors.

It could not

have that effect because that would be tax levy to the
priorities established in the Bankruptcy Act in section 64.
QUESTION:

I wanted to get that straight because,

as I understood your argument, I thought you went farther
than that.
HR. QUAID:

No.

The United States will be protected

in this proceeding since even if they had no lien, they would
have a fourth priority preference under section 64 of the

16
Bankruptcy Act to payment,,

The priorities ahead of them are

costs of administration, priority wage claims, and certain
costs of creditors in defeating plans of arrangement and wageearner plans.

And as far as the third priority is concerned,

there are no 3uch claims.

So the United States will, except

to the extent that they are subject to costs of administration
and priority wage claims, both of which exist, they will not
be subordinated to the claims of general unsecured creditors
or put into the same category as those creditors.
QUESTION:

Even if the referee were to decide against

them as to the perfection of their lien.
MXl. QUA2D:

Yes,

They still enjoy the priority under

section 64 whether they have a lien or not.

Of course, if they

do have a lien, then if they are subordinated under section 67,
they end up in the same priority slot.
Ttirning to section 67, Congress has expressed its
concern over the fact that tax claims are eating up and
diminishing the assets of bankruptcy estates at the current
time and for the last several years.

Consequently they have

established a provision subordinating tax liens, although no
other liens, to the first two priorities of section 64, being
costs of administration and priority wage claims.

This Court

has held that when the tax lien, in the words of the statute,
is not accompanied by possession, that that possession is
being defined as actual possession.

In the case of Goggin v.

17
Division of Labor Law Enforcement of California, they stated
that the purpose of this provision was to give a public warning
to all parties whose rights may be affected by the tax lien
which is unknown to third parties and is characterised as a
secret lien, that if the United States takes actual and
physical possession of the assets, third parties, and in
particular general unsecured creditors who may extend further
credit to such a company will be warned or forewarned

and

can take measures to protect themselves and salvage what they
can from the relationship.
However, the United States did not do this.
served the Notice of Levy and took no further steps.

They
Instead

they waited after the assignment for the assignee to perform,
the liquidation of the tangible equipment and fixtures which
were in the hands of the assignee.

Therefore, we feel that

the assets — X*ra sorry, that the tax lien is subordinated
and postponed to the first two priorities, being costs of
" ■■■

administration and priority wage claims.
We feel that this Court should be guided by the
Bfbiicy of the Bankruptcy Act or the policy expressed by
Congress in the Bankruptcy &ct that tax claims should be
subordinated and that there should be something else for other
parties in the bankruptcy administration, or bankruptcy estate,
at least to provide the bare minimum, being the costs of
administration and the priority wage claims earned by

wage earners within tiirae months preceding the initiation of the
bankruptcy.
We feel that the Bankruptcy Act is the one statute
which deals with all these problems# not only with the
administration of an insolvent corporation's assets, but also
with the treatment of the tax liens or other claims for taxes
of the Internal Revenue Service.
We also feel that this is not an action to restrain
the collection of taxes since we are dealing here with the
Government’s lien and levy# not taxes# and that the Government's
claim that this is not appropriate for a summary proceeding is
not applicable since the case of New Hampshire Fire Insurance
Company v, Scanlon recognized as an expressed statutory exception
to that rule the summary jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.
After the argument of counsel for the United Statos
I will have a short time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Jones.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEITH A. JONES ON BEHALF
OF RESPONDENT
MR. JONES:
Courts

Mr. Chief Justice# and may it please the

The United States did not oppose the grant of certiorari

in this case# but it v;as hoped that the case would serve as
a suitable vehicle for the resolution of

a

question of

substantial importance to the Federal Government's powers of

19
internal revenue collection.
That question is whether the Government's interest
in tangible property that is levied upon — and tangible
property such as bank accounts ~ is terminated or impaired by
the taxpayer's subsequent bankruptcy.
Unfortunately for purposes of clarity and exposition,
•*

that is not the only question that has been raised in this case.
Petitioner has raised at least two major subsidiary issues that
do not relate to the Government's general power to levy or its
power to rely upon the effectiveness of its tax levies, but
rather relate only to the factual peculiarities of this
particular case.
Since this is so, I would like at the outset of my
arguments to focus the Court's attention on what we feel to be
the more important issue in this case, that is, the question
of the Government's right to rely upon its tax levies, notwith­
standing the taxpayer's subsequent bankruptcy.

And I will at

the end of my argument address the subsidiary questions that
petitioner has additionally raised.
I think that the case can foe initially understood
more clearly if It is taken in the form of a hypothetical
example that is somewhat less complicated than the actual facts
of this case.

2 would posit as that example a common situation

where the Government levies upon a bank at which the taxpayer
has a bank account in order to seize the account of the

20
taxpayer.
Under the Internal Revenue Code and the accompanying
regulations, as our brief discusses at some length, tine service
of such a Notice of Levy upon the bank imposes upon the bank
an affirmative duty that is enforceable by personal liability
to turn over the entire amount of the account to the United
States.

And there is no doubt that tinis form of levy is

generally effective for internal revenue purposes.

I say there

is no doubt about it because this method of seizing intangible
property, the method of serving a notice to the person who
holds the intangible rights, has been used by the Government
and approved by this Court at least since the Civil War, and
2 would refer the Court to the cases of Miller v. United States
at 11 Wallace 26S which we did not cite in our brief but is
cited by tine Court of Appeals, and also to the more recent
case of Sims y. United States at 359 U.S. 103.
As to this much of the case, I take it that there is
no dispute between the parties.

The petitioner does not contend

that as a general matter such a levy would be invalid.

Where

we part company with the petitioner is over the consequence to
be derived from the taxpayer’s subsequent bankruptcy after the
levy.

In our view, in the hypothetical example I am using,

the bank’s duty to pay over the monies to the Federal Government
is not affected by the intervention of the subsequent bankruptcy
proceeding.

Such proceeding should not terminate or impair in

21
any way the Government9s rights to reduce that account to its
actual possession and those rights should not be subject —
the rights and obligations established by the levy should not
be affected by the subsequent bankruptcy proceeding.
Now, in taking this position we do not rely upon
any special preference for the Government or upon any special
exigencies in favor of Pederal tax collection, although of course
ve feel that that should be taken into account.

But our

reliance here is upon a long-established and sound rule of
bankruptcy practice that this Court has applied on many
occasions in the past.

That rule is that a bankruptcy court

lacks summary jurisdiction over property held by a third party
as custodian, agent, or bailee for a third person who is an
adverse party to the bankrupt.

The property so held is not

subject to administration in bankruptcy unless the adverse
claimant so consents to that administration.
Now, compilation of —
QUESTION z

Unless the property is taken av/ay from

him in a plenary suit.
MR. JONES:

That’s right.

QUESTION:

What you mean is it's not subject to

a summary proceeding.
MR. JONES:

In a summary proceeding property would

be turned over without regard to the validity of the adverse
claimant's claim, and then he would have to rely upon hi.3

22
rights as a creditor in the bankruptcy proceeding.
QUESTI3N:

Ho can

file a petition for reclamation,

can’t he?
MR. JONES:
that he could.

X suppose so.

I am advised by co-counsel

But in a plenary proceeding the question turns

exclusively upon the rights of the adverse claimant.

If he

has rights in the property, then it belongs to him and isn’t
subject to administration in bankruptcy at all.

So that the

distinction between a summary proceeding and a plenary
proceeding is not merely a matter of the elaborateness of the
procedures, but it affects the substantive rights as well»
QUESTION:

I didn’t quite get that last, Mr. Jones.

Why do you say it affects the substantive rights as well?
MR.JONESs

Well, in tliis case, for example, in a

plenary proceeding, the only issue before the court would be
whether the Government’s levy was valid and whether the
taxpayer owed

a tax.

If so, then the monies would be paid

over to the Government in full.
•

• •

In a nummary proceeding, I take it that petitioner’s
position is that the question is whether those properties had
been the properties of the taxpayer. If so, they are turned
over to the bankruptcy court, and then the United States only
has an interest as a creditor in whatever is left after the
payment of expenses in bankruptcy.
QUESTION:

That’s the consequence of once going into

23
the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court for any kind of
property.
MRo JCBTES:

That's right.

Well, as I say, the general rule upon which we rely
hare is that property held by a third person on behalf of an
adverse claimant is not subject to the summary jurisdiction
of the bankruptcy court.

And a compilation of the cases

applying this rule is set forth at Volume 2,

paragraph 23.06(1}

of Collier's treatise on bankruptcy, and I stress that
paragraph because, although we adverted to a number of related
paragraphs in Collier's we did not include that one in our
brief.

I will repeat, it’s paragraph 23.06(1).
I will discuss just two of those cases here for

purposes of example.

In Taubel v. Fox, 264 U.S. 426, a

sheriff had pursuant to a judgment levy seised the property of
a debtor, and while the sheriff was still holding the property
the debtor was adjudicated a bankrupt, and the bankruptcy
v.

court sought to require the sheriff to pay over the property
to the receiver in bankruptcy.

This Court concluded that since

the property wa3 being held by the sheriff on behalf of an
adverse claim, that is, the judgment creditor, it was not
subject to summary turnover.

Instead, the sheriff was free

to release the property to the judgment creditor.
In this connection, I would like to refer to
page 23 of our brief, footnote 10, where we misdescribe

24
Taubel v, Fox to our o\m disadvantage.

We stated in that

footnote that in that case, Taubel v. Fox, this Court merely
held that property., and so forth, and we should have said
this Court merely stated that property in the hands of a non~
adverse third person, who was not holding it as agent for any
adverse claimant, was subject to turnover.

In fact, the

Court in Taubel went on to hold, since the sheriff in that
case was holding for an adverse claimant, then the property
was not subject to summary turnover.
The other case of this Court, that I would mention was
First National. Bank y. Title and Trust Company at 198 U.S. 280,
and in that case the third party in possession was a warehouse"’
man who was holding the property for a third person who was
ah adverse claimant to the bankrupt, to whom the bankrupt had
assigned the warehouse receipt.

Once again the Court held

that the property in the warehouseman’s hands was not subject
to summary turnover.
V7e believe that this general rule enunciated and
applied in cases governs this case as well.

Property held for

the United States pursuant to a levy, like property held by
other third persons for other adverse claimants is beyond
the reach of the bankruptcy court’s summary turnover orders.
In

the hypothetical example I have propounded, a bank upon

which the Government has served a valid notice of levy holds
the taxpayer's account for the Government as the Government9s

25
agent.

The Government, as an adverse claimant, is entitled

to receive the monies in that account.

The monies in the

account, like the property seised by the sheriff in Taubel v.
Fox, should be payable to the Government as an adverse claimant
and not to the receiver in bankruptcy for distribution in
accordance with the priority rules of bankruptcy.
QUESTION?

How about the provision in subsection (8)

of section 70a of the Act that equates the possession of the
assignor to the possession of the bankrupt.

You don't have

that in your hypothetical example.
MR. JONES:

That's true.

That's why I used the

hypothetical because I wanted the Court's attention first to
be focused upon the general case of the Government's levy,
and I intended at a later point to address the special considera*"
tions that arise when the person upon whom the levy has been
served is a general assignee, and I hops to get to that point
in a moment.
Now, the petitioner here, as we understand it, doss
not challenge the general rule upon which we rely, it doss
not. challenge the rule that a third person in custody for an
adverse claimant is not subject to summary turnover.

His

argument on this aspect of the case is simply that taxing
authorities, unlike all other similarly situated adverse
claimants, are unable to avail themselves of the benefits of
this general rule.

He bases this argument exclusively upon

26

section 67c(3) of the Bankruptcy Act.
But as we read that statute, it has absolutely nothing
to do with the issue in this case.

The petitioner’s argument

has confused the question of inclusion of property into the
bankrupt estate with that of distributing property out of the
bankrupt estate.

This case is one of inclusion, that is, the

issue is whether the property that has been levied upon is to
be included in the bankrupt estate by virtue of the bankruptcy
court’s summary turnover orders.
address that question at all.

Section 67c(3) does not

It is addressed to the separate,

distinct question of distribution of what priorities various
claimants have to the property that is being distributed out
of the estate.

Nothing in section 67c(3) was intended to treat

the Government any less favorably than other adverse claimants
in constructive possession.

As we have seen, such claimants

are entitled to reduce their property to actual possession
'without any interference from the bankruptcy court.
Well, these are the basic legal considerations as to
the general issue which we feel is involved here.

I think I

should also call this Court’s attention, however, to certain
practical considerations.

It is of great importance that the

United States in its capacity as a collector of taxes be able
to rely upon its notice of levy.

If the Internal Revenue Service

cannot so rely, then it will be forced to resort to more
summary collection procedures or to enforce more immediate

compliance with its notices of levy.

And this would entail

the use of hasty collection devices that inevitably would cause
disruption, would be burdensome and annoying to taxpayers and
to third parties with whom they deal.

We see no social

objective that would be achieved by forcing the Government to
scramble in this way for actual possession, although the
legitimate concerns of bankruptcy administration and internal
revenue collection can be served by giving to the United States
the same rights as are presently held by all other similarly
situated adverse claimants.
In short, both for practical reasons of internal
revenue collection and as a matter of established bankruptcy
procedure, the Government's levy should be honored whether or
not the taxpayer subsequently becomes bankrupt.

The United

States is entitled to rely upon its valid prebankruptcy levy
as placing the property levied upon beyond the reach of the
bankruptcy court.
Now, this completes my presentation of the Government'
position on what we believe to be the central issue in this
case, the issue that the Court presumably took the case to
decide, that, as is evident,, there are other subsidiary issues
in this case.

I now turn to the consideration of those issues.

As Mr. Justice Rehnquist h&3 noted, the petitioner
contends that this case is governed by a special rule in favor
of general assignees.

Ue contends that regardless of the

28
effect that a notice of levy wight have in

other circumstances,

that property held by a general assignee must be turned over to
the receiver in bankruptcy whether or not there has been a levy,
and he relies both upon section 70a(8) of the Bankruptcy Act
and also upon section 2a(21) of that Act.
But although those provisions do state that the
bankruptcy court has jurisdiction to require assignees

for the

benefit of creditors to deliver the property in their possession
to tiie receiver in bankruptcy, they have never been construed
as granting the bankruptcy court summary power to reach
property held by the assignee in a manner adverse to the
-

bankrupt and to the general creditors.

The bankruptcy court’s

summary jurisdiction under those provisions extends only to the
property that the assignee was holding for the exclusive benefit
of general creditors at the time of bankruptcy.
For example, in Galbraith v. Velelli at 256 U.S. 46,
this Court was presented with the contention by a receiver in
bankruptcy that property held by an assignee adversely to the
bankrupt was subject to summary turnover.

In that case, the

assignee had incurred certain expenses of administration prior
to bankruptcy, and he claimed that he was entitled to take the
-Y ;

property, or take the property in the value of the amount of
his expenses, and hold those for himself as an adverse claimant.
And this Court upheld the assignee’s contention.

The Court

held that as to property with respect to which the assignee had

29
himself an adverse claim, that, property was not subject to
turnover to the receiver in bankruptcy, that it was outside
the bankruptcy court's summary jurisdiction,
QUESTION:

That wasn't modified by the Chandler Act

amendments?
MR. JONES:

Section 2a(21) was enacted after the

decision in Galbraith v. 7alel.li, but it was generally
considered as being merely a codification of prior law and
Collier in his treatise, as we indicated in our brief, so
treats that enactment.

And I don't think that anyone has

construed it as being a general requirement that the assignee
turn over all the property in his possession willy-nilly
without regard to any adverse claim.

And I believe that after

the passage of the Chandler Act, lower courts, not this Court,
but lower courts have had the opportunity to apply Galbraith, v.
Vaielli to situations such as the one involved here, and they
have done so to bar the summary turnover of property hold by
the assignee for his ownself or as custodian or agent for a
third person from summary turnover to the receiver in
bankruptcy.

MR. JONES:

Here the levy was made before bankruptcy?
That's correct.

That is right.
And then carae backruptcy, and any rights

rights of the trustee or the estate against the assignee only

Of course, they

QUESTION?

The levy arose before bankruptcy.

MR. JONESi

The levy was served upon the assignee

before bankruptcy.
One of the petitioner's

arguments in this case,

a second subsidiary kind of argument, is that the assignee
wasn't holding any properties subject to levy.

He claims that

the proceeds in the assignee’s hands weren't subject to levy
under the Internal Revenue Code.
plednly wrong.

We believe that contention is

The assignee — let me backtrack.

The taxpayer was holding the property subject to the

31
Government's lien»

When the taxpayer assigned the property

to the assignee, the assignee took the property subject to the
lien.

Petitioner concedes that much.
QUESTION:

May I interrupt at that point?

What

had happened up to that time had been the notice of a deficiency
assessment, as I understood it.
MR. JONESi

There was an assessment of taxes due,

right.
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

Did that create a lien?
It did.
Not a lien which gave any notice to other

creditors, though, did it?
MR. JONES:

No, and that lien until perfected

would not have been valid as against, for example, a bona
fide purchaser.

It only became perfected when the Notice of

Lien, not the Notice of Levy, but the Notice of Lien was
properly filed.
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:

That was filed with the assignee.
No, that was done

the Notice of Levy

The Notice of Lien was filed

in the appropriate State office, but they were both filed
after the assignee took possession of the property.
QUESTION:

And the Notice of Levy was filed, as X

understand it, after he sold the chattel -MR. JONES:

After he had

reduced the property to

32
proceeds, to cash.
QUESTION*

For the benefit of the creditors who

under Illinois law are the beneficiaries of the trust, isn't
that right?
MR. JONES:

That’s right.

Of course, our argument

is that Federal law supervenes.
QUESTION:

Also the Federal law talks about property

or rights to property of the taxpayer.
MR. JONES:

Yes.

You a re talking about section 6331.

QUESTION: Which is the whole basis of this lawsuit.
MR. JONES;

Yes, it is.

But one aspect of that

provision that the petitioner has consistently overlooked in
this case is the fact that the Government's levy does not reach
only

property of the taxpayer.
I seem to be searching in vain for the statutory

language.

It’s section 6331(a) which is set forth at page 12a

of the petition for writ of certiorari, provides that "If any
person

liable to pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay the

seme within 10 days after

notice and demand, it shall be

lawful for the Secretary or his delegate to collect such tax
by levy upon ail property and rights to property belonging
to such person or on which there is a lien provided in this
chapter for the payment of such tax."
And it is our contention that the Government5s lien
in this case reattached to the proceeds in substitution.

33

QUESTION:
MR, JONES:

That's really the question, isn’t it?
That’s one of the three questions,

I

regard that as a subsidiary —
QUESTIONs
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

It’s not the big question that you hoped
That's correct.
That you did not oppose certiorari in

because you hoped the Court would decide.

But that is a more

particularized question in this case.
MR. JONES:

That is true.

Nov;, in our brief v;e cited Justice Story’s opinion
in Sheppard v. Taylor as an example of this Court's application
of the Federal common law rule that a lien does attach to
proceeds in substitution.

That is also the rule under Illinois

law, as we oited a number of Illinois cases in our brief
that stand for the proposition that when an assignee under
Illinois lav; takes property subject to a lien and sells that
property, the lien reattaches to the proceeds.

The same

rule under both Federal common law and Illinois common law.
Petitioner’s sol© reliance for alleged contrary
authority is upon United States v. Be3S.

Eut in that case,

that case holds at the very most that the Government’s lien
will not reattach to proceeds that were not fully realizable
in the taxpayer’s hands.

In that case the Government had a

lien on a taxpayer’s insurance policy, and after the death of
the taxpayer, the monies, the face amount of the policy was

»

34

paid to the beneficiary and the Government claimed the face
amount.

This Court held that as to the proceeds that would

have been realizable in the taxpayer's hands, that is the
cash surrender value, the Government1s lien reattached.

As to

the proceeds that were not realisable in the hands of the
taxpayer, that is, the additional insurance proceeds above
and beyond the cash surrender value, the lien would not
reattach.
Now, petitioner tries to fit himself within this
harrow exception to the general rule that the lien reattaches
to proceeds in substitution.
able'to do that.

I frankly don't see how he is

The taxpayer in this case could just as

easily as did the general assignee
cash.

The taxpayer could have sold

convert the property into
off the property,

liquidated its receivables, and received cash in exactly the
same
manner as the general assignee.
£

There is no reason

Whatsoever in this case why the Government's lien should not
reattach to those proceeds in substitution.

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERt

You have something

further, Mr. Quaid?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS E. QUAID ON
BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. QUAID:

Just vriefly, Mr. Chief Justice.

The assignee was not holding for adverse claimants
as in the cases cited by counsel for the Government.

He was

holding for the benefit of general creditors, he was not
holding for a particular creditor as was the sheriff in the
Taubal v. Fox case cited by the Government.

He was holding

as a State-appointed receiver or representative of creditors.
QUESTION s

What would you say if there had never

been a bankruptcy?
MR. QUAID:

Well, then, it would have been an

entirely different situation.
QUESTION:

I know, but who would have ~ would the

levy have been good?
MR. QUAID:

Well, I think it would have become a

moot question because the United States would have had a
first priority under section 3466 of the revised statute.

36

QUESTIONS

That may ha so when the assignee finally

distributed and paid his expenses out of it.

The question

here is whether he would have had to turn the proceeds over
to the Government.
MR. QUAZD:

I think he may have in that situation

due to the fact that bankruptcy did not subsequently occur,
arid also the situation —
QUESTIONS

Except for the Bankruptcy Act, you would

say the assignee was subject to the levy and would have had to
4

turn the proceeds over.
MR. QUAIDs

I think the important factor in this

case is the Bankruptcy Act and the policy that Congress has
set forth in the Bankruptcy Act.
QUESTIONS
valeill

Yet that case, the case of Galbraith v.

does seem to say that where the assignee holds

adversely to the interest of the general creditors, there is
no summary jurisdiction in the bankruptcy court.
MR. QUAIDs

There he was holding in his own personal

sense adversely.
QUESTIONS

But here the Government says as a matter

of tax law, the levy had proceeded to such a stage that he
was holding for the benefit of the Government.
MR. QUAIDs

We feel that tax law is wrong and

inappropriate in a bankruptcy situation, whether itcs a Federal
statute more comprehensive and which considers the rights of

37
all parties which are involved.
QUESTION;

Yes, but the date of the — the minute

before bankruptcy you say the Government's levy was good and
that he would have had to turn it over if bankruptcy hadn't
ensued.

The minute before bankruptcy that was the situation,

that the assignee was not holding for the benefit of the
creditors 3olely, he was holding for the benefit of the United
States to the extent of their tax levy.
MR. JONES:

But the bankruptcy did come and did

change the rights of the respective parties.
I thank you gentlemen for your attention.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 3:07 p.m., the argument in the
above-entitled matter was concluded.)
