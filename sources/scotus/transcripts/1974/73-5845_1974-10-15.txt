PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argu­

ments next in Ho. 73—50^ 13, Jackson against Metropolitan
EdIson Company.
Mr. Greenbergs you may proceed whenever you are
re ady.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACK GREENBERG, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GREENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case Is here on Writ of certiorari to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.

The

case involves whether a public utility which provides
electricity under a grant of monopoly conferred by the
state, which possesses under state lav; various and
considerable powers and is regulated by the state
pervasively may, pursuant to state-granted and approved
termination procedures, cut off a consumer's power
without notice and hearing for alleged nonpayment of the
disputed bill.
Q

A consumer or a customer?
MR. GREENBERG:

A customer.

I’ll answer to this question briefly — is that
a monopoly, functioning under such state-granted powers
and regulations which supplies a necessity of life, performs

4
state action in the l^lth Amendment sense and with respect
to its termination procedures, must accord due process of
law.
And, in a case like this, due process of law
requires some sort of fair notice and hearing procedures
before termination.
To define Petitioner’s position more precisely —
Q

Hr. Greenberg, what is the scope in this particular

case of the hearing?

What would be the issues?

MR. GREENBERG:

Our suggestion on the hearing

procedure, the hearing on termination, would be that we
adopt the position of the brief amicus curiae of the
New York State Public Utilities Commission and that is
that the cause should be reversed, sent back to the district
court with an invitation, the district court extending an
invitation or perhaps requiring the Public Utilities
Commission to come in and together fashioning a fair
termination hearing procedure.
The cases of this Court and elsewhere demonstrate
that a large variety of procedures could possibly accord
with the requirements of dur process of law and we do not
argue for any particular kind of procedure.
One procedure —
Q

I am not so concerned about procedure,

Mr. Green­

berg, as what would be the issues in this particular case?

5
MR. GREENBERG:

In this particular case, it

would be whether or not the consumer was liable for the
payment of this
Q

disputed bill and, if so, how much?

There would be no other issue, would there?
MR. GREENBERG;

Q

Not in this particular case, no.

And, as a generality, would that not likely be

true?
MR. GREENBERG:

That is — again, I think the

brief of the New York State Public Utilities Commission is
very useful in that that is the typically the kind of
dispute and frequently those kinds of disputes are
resolved by sending out an independent meter reader but
they sometimes may. involve other kinds of Issues which
may have to be resolved in other ways.
In this particular case, that would be the only
issue.
Q

You used the term ’’consumer," Mr. Greenberg.

Are you using it in contradistinction to "customer"? ■
MR. GREENBERG:

No, I’m not and I would confess

I was slightly puzzled by Mr..Justice Stewart's question.
I’m using it almost synonymously.
Q

’Tell, we are going to get on into this case and

find that, as I understand it, that your client is not a
customer, in fact.
MR. GREENBERG:
Q

Well, uh —

That is one of the — that is the Issue in this

6
case.
MR. GREENBERG:

That is one of the issues that

was raised by the Respondent in this case.

However, we would

submit that — that the Petitioner in this case quite
assuredly has standing to raise the issues presented in
this particular case.
Q

Well, you meant any consumer, then, rather than —
MR. GREENBERG:

Q

Oh, this is service to her home.

You inadvertently, I think, then, gave, from your

point of view, the wrong answer to my question.
You said "consumer" and I said, "Do you mean
consumer or customer?" and you said "customer."

I think,

in this, your client is not a customer.
MR. GREENBERG:

Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, the

company has viewed her as such.
0.

They have —

She is a former customer.
MR. GREENBERG:

Isn't that correct?

No, they came to her and they

asked her to get $30 by Monday because the power is going to
her home and they are looking to her as being responsible and
liable for paying this bill so perhaps that is why I view
them synonymously because I think this implicates the
standing issue.
They are looking to her for payment of the bill
and for the first time in this Court, they are raising the
issue that someone else really is responsible for it but

7
both courts below and the Respondent in this case have
treated the case as if she owes the money.
How, it may be that the money has been paid.
haven't had a hearing.

We don't know.

We

It may be that the

money has not been paid and someone else is liable for it
and it may be that she, indeed, is liable for it.
There hasn't been a hearing and one can't tell.
But they have been treating her as the one
responsible for the bill so that is why, in my mind,
consumer and customer were synonymous though, in some cases,
they might not be.
Q

As I understand the utility's point, they would

be somewhat Indifferent to who paid the money, if the
amount due was paid.
MR, GREENBERG:
know, may have been paid.

Well, the amount due, for all we
I think , as I have discussed

the issues in this case with other lawyers and students and
others, I have not met a person to whom either a mistaken
bill has not been sent or who doesn't know someone to whom
a mistaken bill was sent.
And it is not an uncommon thing.
bill was paid.

There hasn't been a hearing.

It may be the
No one has —

in fact, she has not yet received a bill in this case.
Q

But cutting off the service to this particular

home isn't the same thing as asserting a claim for the

B
deficiency in the bill against Mrs. Jackson.
MR. GREENBERG:

Well, they did both.

An

employee of the company came to her house on a Thursday
and said, "Have $30 by Monday," and on Monday, employees
of the company came there and without anything being said,
they terminated her power.
Q

But is that unambiguous as to whether the threat

was, "I'll cut off your power or I’ll seek a judgment
against you?"
MR. .GREENBERG:

Wall, there was never any talk

of seeking a judgment against her.
Q

So it was just basically cutting off the power.
MR. GREENBERG:

Cutting off the power but

throughout this case they have maintained, until now, that
they cut it off because she has not paid a computed bill.
Mow they claim there are some standing issues
that.they might put in other ways.
Q

'Now, as I understand it, the service has been

resumed under order of the court.
MR. GREENBERG:

Under a temporary restraining

order.
Q

And has any payment been made by anybody for

utilities service rendered since it was restored?
MR. GREENBERG:

Mr. Justice Blackmun, they have

not sent her any bills and I think that may perhaps be

9
to preserve some legal position they are asserting but they
haven’t said.
However3 she has been budgeting and putting money
away in a savings account for the day when the bill arrives.
Q

But you wouldn’t — I don’t suppose you would

object ifs under the temporary restraining order, the court
could have ordered her to pay currently, for her power?
HR. GREENBERG:
Q

Without a doubt.

Yes.
MR. GREENBERG:

argument when I discuss

And, in fact, at a point in my
some of the issues that might

arise under fair hearing procedures, that certainly could
be a condition precedent to a hearing, that is, the paying
of some undisputed amount or some basic amount or something

of the sort, without a doubt.
I’d like to define Petitioner’s position on the
state action point a little more precisely before proceeding
with the rest of my argument, and that is, it does not
necessarily imply that a state action standard must be
applied to any of the utility’s actions other than those
)

involving the furnishing of electricity, for which it was
granted its monopoly power.
For example, the right of the utility to have a
religious display at its headquarters or to regulate the
speech of its employees or respect their privacy and so

10

forth involves other factors which need not be considered
here and we do not contend that a supplier who does not
enjoy a state-conferred monopoly of a necessity or life
or anyone else is, by the due process clause, required to
grant notice and hearing before cutting off, for example,
milk deliveries or gasoline or credit or so forth.
In those cases, the consumer can always turn to
another source and such a case also would consider other
factors.
Q

In your brief, you speak about the public

function notion, rely on Munn against Illinois and you
cite the Nebbla case.

Is this a part of the argument

you are making to this Court?
MR. GREENBERG:

It Is a part of the argument

only in the sense that the court of appeals for the Third
Circuit, in deciding either the state action issue or the
fair hearing Issue or both, would somewhat merge together
in the court of appeals* opinion, makes a point that the
furnishing of electricity is not state action when the
relationship to a subscriber is concerned and they note
that it might be state action If a ’whole community were
involved and they point out that the cessation of
electricity would interfere with water purification and
hospitals and communications and so forth.
We submit that that is far too narrow a view,

11
that when a consumer’s power is

cut off and she is

essentially cut off from the energy system and has neither
heat nor light nor refrigeration, the observation of the
court of appeals that she can operate her oil burner
manually and use kerosene lamps and put ice in her
refrigerator is, you know, is ill-taken.

This really is

a furnishing of a necessity of life that in a modern society
with the infrastructure that we have, that it is the
furnishing of something as essential and vital to the
community as, let's say, money.
Q

Well, that is really a narrower argument than you

make in your brief, isn't it?

Because if you take that

public function and affect it with a public interest doctrine
in Mum and follow it through to Nebbia in our decisions,
you find that a grocery store in Rochester that sold a
quart of milk was affected with a public interest.
MR. GREENBERG:

We do not contend for that.

In

this case we contend only for a monopoly with regard to the
services the monopoly was granted its powers to furnish
when those services are, as is typically the case with a
state-granted monopoly, a necessity of life and we would
place in just the clearest category, electricity and water
and there might be several other functions as well.
But we assert the argument as narrowly as I have
just stated it.

12
Q

Hospital care would be included?
HR. GREENBERG:

Well, hospital care would involve

the question of alternatives.

One, perhaps, can go to a

variety of hospitals in many communities but if your
power is cut off, there is no place else you can go and if
your water is cut off, there is no place else you can go.
If there were only one hospital in the community,
it might be one case.

That is not always the situation.

I would just guess that is rarely the situation.
Q

Why, Mr. Greenberg, is the question whether the

necessity of life vel non relevant to whether it is action
of the state?
MR. GREENBERG:

It is not relevant to whether it

is action of the state.
Q

Well, that is the issue here.
MR. GREENBERG:

It is relevant to whether a

due process hearing is required in these circumstances.
The action of the state obviously —
Q

Well, of course, there is no due process hearing

required until or unless it is action of the state.

That

is common ground.
MR. GREENBERG:

Yes, the court of appeals — and

I find that others, too, sometimes tend to and perhaps the
lawyers merges the questions together.
appeals certainly did.

The court of

13
Q

Well, that confuses everything, wouldn't you

agree?
MR. GREENBERG:

Well, it does, but I am responding

to the decision on which we are taking it to this Court.
Certainly, it first must be action of the state
and it is action of the state whether it is a necessity of
life or not.
Q

Right.

So the necessity of life vel non has

nothing to do with whether or not it is action of the state
in your submission.

Is that right?

MR. GREENBERG:

That is right, but it has to do

ivith whether or not a due process hearing is required.
This Court, in —
Q

Well, of course a due process — if it is action

of the state, then any state action that deprives anybody
of liberty or property has to be taken within the meets and
bounds of due process.
Then the question is, what does due process
require here in this situation?
MR. GREENBERG:

Does It require a hearing?

And,

obviously, In Roth against the University, the action of
the state was involved but a hearing was not required
because it was not that kind of a situation.
Q

But due process was required.
MR. GREENBERG:

Yes.

Q

The question Is, what does due process
MR. GREENBERG:

Q

Yes, that is correct.

— mean in a particular circumstance?
MR. GREENBERG:

Well, I subscribe to our

analysis, Mr. Justice Stewart.

I was

trying to speak in

terms of how many of the decisions have treated the
subject and in a brief argument, I thought I would speak
in the language of a lot of the decisions because,
*

obviously, first, there must be action of the state.

If

there is action of the state, there must be due process.
Due process sometimes requires a hearing and
sometimes does pot require a hearing.
Q

Right.
MR. GREENBERG:

Sometimes due process can be

satisfied by other procedures.
Q

But necessity of life, for now, does — you are

not arguing whether or not this is state action?
MR. GREENBERG:

No, but it certainly does have

to do with whether or not a hearing is required.
Q

Right.
MR. GREENBERG:

And I think the hearings speak

of, does the Petitioner —
Q

Well, that requires state action.
MR. GREENBERG:

—- does he have an option?

If

he can go off and get a job in another university, that is

15

somethin?; to be taken into account.

If one is limited to a

particular situation, that is another decision.
Q

Right.

Q

Mr. Greenberg, xvould you have found state action

in this case, if no tariff had been filed with the state
utility commission?
Suppose there had been no action expressed or
implied by the state utility commission?
MR. GREENBERG:
would.

Mr. Justice Powell, I believe I

However, I must say that whether state action

exists or not involves a mass of factors which have to be
put together and weighed and I think even without the tariff
being filed and approved and promulgated and as a matter of
state law, I think the state granted monopoly powers and the
various regulations and so forth would be sufficient.
Now, if you start chipping away one factor after
another, at some point I would have to say, well, it is
not enough to make state action under, let

us say, the

Burton test, just to select that.
But I think If you took away only that, yes, there
would be state action.
Q

Would your basic issue be any different if you

were dealing with, let us say, cable television which had
been licensed and was regulated?
MR. GREENBERG:

Yes, it would be.

Yes, It would.

16
We have just taken the cable television out of our apart­
ment because the children look at it too much and I think
everybody functions perfectly happily well and they can
look at the television that comes over the regular
antenna.
So I do not — would not think — there would be
state action involved, there would not be a hearing be
required by due process.
Now, this case involves a number of factors, some
of which I have already alluded to, weighed by this Court
in determining whether a notice and hearing are required
before summary action may be taken, as in summary termina­
tion of employment or dispossession or repossession or
garnishee cases.
And, briefly, those factors are, and I just
refer to a number that I consider to be among the most
important of them, what is the expectation in the funds,
service, jobs or so forth of the one claiming the hearing?
Q

You are now —

you have now left the state

action, I take it?
MR. GREENBERG:

For the moment, yes.

Second, what is the effect of summary termination
on him?
Three, what altei’natives does he have?
Four, what is the effect on the community in

17
taking time for a hearing?
Five, what costs are Involved?
Six, what is the likelihood that the taking is
wrongful?
And I would like to elaborate on these points
somewhat.
The first is, what is the expectation in the
subject matter concerning which a hearing is claimed for
termination?

If it is sufficient, it is deemed to be a

property right althoupjh in this case it also can be viewed
as involving liberty because when one's power is cut off,
one is left in the dark and the cold and it certainly is a
circumscription of one’s liberty.
The expectation of continuous service is one
which subscribers to the utility have a virtual statute.
Section 1171 of the Public Utilities Code
requires reasonably continuous service without delays and
unreasonable interruptions.
Decisions of the Public Utility Commission which
are not cited in the briefs

but which are published, such

as Westlnghouse Club against Pennsylvania Water Company,
which is October 3th, 1935, Lufty against Manufacturers
Light and Heat, August 27, 193*1 and Pishneri versus Browns­
ville Uater Company, June 12, 1928 and numerous other
decisions,

these are only three out of several score,

18
hold that service may not be terminated for nonpayment

of

a disputed bill but there is no meaningful way to enforce
this right because there is no right to a hearing before
cut-off.
Counsel in

this very case5 I might add, has

petitioned the Public Utilities Commission on July 25th
and 31st, 1973 on behalf of this Petitioner and others in
a complaint alleging that they are subject to having their
water service cut off for nonpayment of bills without prior
hearing and the Commission, on March 20th, 197*1, dismissed
the complaint as failing to state a cause of action.
It treated them as requesting a rule allowing
installment payments to be made on bills but deferred
action even on that until after this Court rules In this
case.
Therefore, we submit that the Petitioner’s
expectation is sufficient to rise to the level of property
and liberty protected by the due process clause although
state procedures are inadequate to protect it.
The second factor, what is the effect of summary
termination on the one whose property or liberty is taken?
The effect in this case, we submit, is as brutal,
to use the term that appears in the case involving deter­
mination of wealth here, as in Goldberg against Kelly,
garnisheeing of wages as in Sniadach, which was said to

19
drive a family to the wall or termination of a driver's
license s as in Bell against Burson, which interfered with
conduct of a ministry.
And despite the argument of the court of appeals
that oil burners can be operated manually and ice can be
used in refrigerators and kerosene lamps provide adequate
illumination, that is just not so and we just say it is
common knowledge that it is not so in an urban society.
I think we all recall the near-catastrophe when
the power grid failed in the northeast and that effect upon
a single Individual is proportionately the same.
Q

I don't find these points here.
MR. GREENBERG:

These points are not treated in

the brief as systematically as I am trying to present them
in the argument.

They are, perhaps, in one point or another

in the brief.
What are the alternatives for the Petitioner?
Petitioner cannot get electricity elsewhere.
Unlike the employee in Arnett

who might get another job

or the untenured professor in Roth who might get employment
elsewhere, the Respondent's monopoly assures that.
Another point which the decisions consider is
what may be the effect on the community of taking time for
notice and hearing?

This is unlike the case of poisoned

food, which must be seised before distribution or narcotics.

20

which must be seized before they work their way into the
community and have their effect or the situation of a bank
which is about to fail and then will bring financial
failure to large parts of the community.
It is not a case like that at all.
It might be argued that taking time for notice
and hearing entails costs.
something.

Hearings may, indeed, cost

Petitioner, in theory, may run up fresh, unpaid

bills but here a rule could -- and as in New York and as
has been

suggested by, I believe it was Mr. Justice

Blackmun, a requirement of the temporary restraining order
might have been continuation of payment of bills.
Petitioner might even be required to pay weekly.
A variety of measures can be taken to assure the security
of the company.

The past bill is owed.

The question is,

what is going to be happening in the future?
Certainly, this is not a case in which leading
time for hearing permits a Petitioner to abscond with
property as in some of the cases this Court has treated.
Now, another —
Q

Isn’t the only thing at issue the $30?

Do you

concede that if the company was to continue service that
there should be current payment?
MR. GREENBERG:
Q

Oh, without a doubt.

Oh, sure.

And also, if it is found that she really doesn’t

21

owe this $30, If she goes ahead and pays it, the odds are
that she is going to get it back.
HR. GREENBERG:
Q

Oh, sure.

I mean, so that there is

no risk of loss on her

part and the real question is whether the $30, whether it
is, without notice or anything, without a hearing, she
should be required to put

up $30 pending a hearing on the

matter.
MR. GREENBERG:

She was agreeable to doing that

and I think that case wouldn't be here if they had taken the
$30, you know, and the electricity continued.
Q

I don't understand that.

She ;vas willing to pay

the -- put up the $30 and litigate about it?
MR. GREENBERG:

Well, the — the record says they

said have $30 by Monday and she said okay.

That is all the

record says.
Q

Was the $30 tendered?
MR. GREENBERG:

No, because when they came out on

Monday morning, they just' cut off the electricity and
wouldn’t talk to her.
Q.

You don't suggest that the company would have

turned it off if she had paid them the $30 and told them,
"Well, look, I don't owe the $30 and I’m going to try to
get it back from you”?
MR. GREENBERG:

Oh, I think they would have in

22
this case.

The only thing that we know is that they came

on Thursday and said, "Have $30 by Monday," and they came
on Monday and they wouldn't talk to her.

They cut her off.

She called them several times and she also —
Q

Well, let me get it clear.

Do you say that the

due process clause would have been satisfied if the company
said, "Look, pay us by Monday or we are going to turn your
power off," and she said, "Well, all right, I'll pay you
Monday and the only thing is, I an going to litigate with
you and try to get it back."
MR. GREENBERG:

Oh, I don't think the due process

clause would have been satisfied.
think itfe’d have a case here.

I just said I don't

They just would have settled

it between —
Q

Well, all right, but you agree that the $30 is

all that is at issue?

Because she —

MR. GREENBERG:

No.

No, Mr. Justice White,

because while she has not received a bill, the company’s
counsel have Informed her counsel as set forth In the
complaint that she owes $110.
Q

Well, I know, but you concede, Mr. Greenberg,

that she would have to pay currently?
MR. GREENBERG:
Q

Well, all right.
MR. GREENBERG:

Oh, yes.

Yes.

Now, so —
The $110 is past due.

At least,

23
that is what they have told her lawyer.

They have never

sent her a bill.
Q

You mean, of her own past due bills?
MR. GREENBERG:

Q

Yes.

Yes.

Not the $30.
MR. GREENBERG:

That’s right.

They claim — one

can interpret the $30 episode as saying, "Give us a $30
downpayment on the $110
Q

that you owe us, past due."

Well, I’ll put it to you again.

The only thing

at issue is her past due bills and whether or not it is fair
to say, "You put up the money now and we’ll keep your
power going."

That is really the only issue.

MR. GREENBERG:
Q

No —

Because she is bound to get her money back If she

wins.
MR. GREENBERG:

Well, the issue in the case Is,

is she entitled to notice and hearing before the cut-off?
That is the issue in the case.
Q

Before paying $30»
MR. GREENBERG:

Or before paying her bills.

Well, she — she claims that she

doesn’t owe anything.
Q

I understand that, Mr. Greenberg.

But the question

is, who has to take the risk?
MR. GREENBERG:

Q

That’s right.

Whose money is going to be up meanitfhile?

2*1

MR. GREENBERG:
Q

Right.

Who is losing interest on money meanwhile?
MR. GREENBERG:

Right.

We would submit in this case that she is re­
quired to notice and hearing before she is required to pay
any money on the past bills.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS H. DEBEVOISE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. DEBEVOISE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
I do think it is important to the case to take
just a minute to go back to the facts on whether this is a
termination case or not.
This 28-year-old woman bought a house in ’69.

A

year later, her electricity was terminated for nonpayment of
bills, 49 minutes later, in some manner, it was reconnected
and thereafter, bills did not come to her.

They came to a

man who was staying at her house.
A year following that —
Q
occurred?

Does the record show the change in billing

28

MR. DEBEVOISE;

The only witness was the

Petitioner and she says that she has no idea how it came
about.

But after that and for a period of 13 months, bills

came to a man staying in her house.
Q

And not to her.
MR* DEBEVOISE:

And not to her.

And during that

period, she made no effort to pay the bill that was out­
standing for the service prior to that termination.
Then an employee came on a Wednesday, looking for
the man in the house and was informed that he had left some
month and a half previously.

He also looked at the meter.

The next day, another man came to thehouse and
discussed the situation with the Petitioner and they must
have hdd some discussion about who the customer was and
termination and all of that, because she testifies that she
told this man to put the electric service in the name of
Robert Jackson, "To give me time to get the rest of the
money to pay the old bill.1'
Robert Jackson was her 12-year-old son.
Three days later, a man came and disconnected the
service.

She then telephoned the company man who had been

there the preceding

Thursday, found he was not in the

office, but he had left word for her to be given his home
number so that she could call him at home, which she did.
lie then told her, according to her testimony, who

29
was responsible for the matter now, another employee of the
company.

She testified she never called him.
Nov;, it is our position under those facts that

she was not a customer who was terminated.
apply for service.

Nor did she

She could still apply for service.

The

company, in view of the past history under the tariff would
have the right to require a reasonable deposit and to —
Q

Did somebody tell her to pay $30?
MR. DE3EV0ISE:

Q

That is her testimony.

And —

It is uncontradicted.
MR. DEBEVOISE:

And it is uncontradicted and

if

it was $30, I'm sure —
Q

Well, didn't that recognize her as a customer?
MR. DEBEVOISE:

No, it recognized that she was a

former customer, as counsel said, with an outstanding bill
of over $100.
Q

Did they tell her anything about the $110 then?
MR. DEBEVOISE:

There is nothing at this time in

here on the $110.
Q

The only thing in the record is that somebody

said, "Lady, give me $30 or I am going to cut your
electricity off."
MR. DEBEVOISE:
together in that fashion.

No, your Honor, it Isn't tied
There Is mention of the $30.

There is her straight forward admission that she still owed

30
the bill that was over a year old.
Q

I’m not — all I am dealing with now is whether

you were treating her as a customer or not.
HR. DEBEVOISE:

I believe, your Honor, that it

was- a — there was a discussion about new service.

There

had to be, because she testified she said "Put it in the
name of Robert Jackson."
Now, in that conversation, there was evidently
some mention of $30.
Q

Do you usually change service is somebody has a

conversation in a house or don!t you do it in the office?
Or are you different from every place else?
MR. DEBEVOISE:
Q

I —

Were you negotiating something there?

What

were you doing?
MR. DEVEVGISE:

Well, your HOnor, maybe it would

be helpful if I took just a minute before getting to state
action to tell you the company's procedures in regard to
delinquent accounts.
In ’73 — 1973, there were 217,000 notices of
delinquent accounts that went out. .
Q

How many?
MR. DEBEVOISE:

Q

217,000.

Is this in the record?
MR. DEBEVOISE:

It isn’t, your Honor,

There are

31
very similar figures in the City of Philadelphia’s brief.
Q

Is the 217,000 in York?
MR. DEBEVOISE:

In the service area of Metropolitan

Edison, which includes more than York.

It includes some­

what less than —
Q

Well, you don't have many more than 17,000

customers in York, do you?
MR. DEBEVOISE:

I don't believe we do, your

Honor, no.
Q

Well, I mean, after all —

Q

That suggests that some of the customers may

have received multiple notices, does it not?
MR. DEBEVOISE:

Yes, it does.

Now, that goes out

after — 30 days after the bill and when no response is
heard from that — and there were 129,000 such cases — those
cases were referred to the credit manager and the credit
manager then eithers then either, in person, as in this
case, where they went out looking for the customer, or by
phone or by mail, try to contact the customer.

And there

were in 1973 only t,390 terminations.
So it is not a procedure whereby if a bill Is not
immediately paid the switch is pulled.
Similarly, this is a matter In which the public
has tremendous interest.

For instance,

Fortune reported

in September that in March of 197^, when it forewent its

32
dividend of $28 million, Consolidated Edison had outstanding
bills of $367 million 151,000 with an average life of 59
days for those bills.
The amount of dividend foregone was $28 million.
It lost $2*4.5 million in uncollectible accounts in 1973.
So these procedures on collection are extremely
important to the public.
Last Saturday the papers carried the account of
the tremendous cutback in electric utilities construction
that has been caused, again, by a lack of cash in these
times of inflation.
I’d like to turn to the question of state action.
I think it is maybe posed most directly by the California
Amici when they present the issue that state action is
present where significant governmental interests are
promoted by a pattern of regulations delegating state power
to ostensibly private persons who then act with the force
of law.
That is similar to what counsel said and repeated
about this grant of monopoly power.

It didn’t work that

way.
In 1913, when the public utility law of Pennsyl­
vania was passed and It set forth regulation over not only
electric utilities but, of course, work companies, grain
elevator companies, telephone companies, pipeline

33
corporations, ferries and all the other things — I might
add, and the service of electricity by Met Ed’s prede­
cessors had been going on for a substantial time.

Met Ed

Is still subject to a 99-year lease, entered into in 1894
and has a contract in perpetuity with the Town of Middletown to sell them electricity at a cent a kilowatt hour in
perpetuity that was entered into in 1906.
So it was not a grant of state power that resulted
in the regulated utility system we have today.

Instead, it

was a recognition that many businesses are affected with
the public Interest and the desire to protect the consumer
;

.

•/.

■'

led to their regulation.
That being true and Justice Brandeis’ concurring
opinion in Southwestern Bell goes into this subject at
length —■ that being true, all acts of a public utility are
not actions of the state.
Now, where the state has particularly ordered the
electric utility to do something and the utility then goes
out under color of that order and does something, certainly,
that would be the type of action that would receive the
protection that Petitioner here seeks.
On the other hand, the filing of its practices
so that Its customers will have knowledge of its practices,
practices which are not acted on by the state, the tariff
being filed because the state requires you, for the

34
protection of your customers to let your customers know how
you are going to operate,
Q

Of course, the Petitioner contends, I guess, that

the inaction of the Commission after the filing was tanta­
mount to affirmative approval.
MR. DEBEVOISE:

I think that is the issue,

whether inaction can be accorded with action.

Wow, I have

no question that an electric utility operating under the
New York Public Service termination procedures would, then,
be acting — would be state action.
But where there has been no

action, we do not

believe it should be extended.
It is mentioned in the briefs that Vermont
instituted termination procedures.
Q

Last week —

You say that if the Commission had entered an

affirmative order approving the tariff.
MR. DEBEVOISE:
Q

Saying, you do it this way.

Well, no, it didn't say, you do it this way.

It

just approved it.
MR, DEBEVOISE:

It accepted it for filing, I

believe.
Q

Well, I know, but let's assume it had entered

an order approving it.

Let's assume it had been litigated.

Say the tariff had been attacked and the attack centered
strictly on the rule and the Commission said, this is quite

35
legal under state law and we approve it.

We have no grounds

to disapprove it and we approve it.
MR. DEBEVOISE:

I think — T. think in that case

that the company acting under it would get support and
encouragement from state action and a suit against those
procedures would lie.
So it is strictly a question of whether no action
is equivalent to this type of approval.
Q

Nov;, a suit against those procedures would lie,

in fact — in my brother White’s hypothetical, he assumed
that there was a suit brought against those procedures and
that it was unsuccessful, as I understood his question.
MR. DEBEVOISE:

Right.

But then the utility went

out and —
Q

And then the Commission turns the power off without

a hearing.
MR, DEBEVOISE;
Q

Right,

And the issue is, whether the act of turning the

power off without a hearing is action, of the state.
0.
Q

Right.
And you would say it would be.
MR. DEBEVOISE:

Q

Do you need to concede that?
MR. DEBEVOISE:

Q

Yes.

Well —

You can, safely, in this case, maybe, but that is

36
a pretty big concessions it seems to me.
MR. DEBEVOISE:

It is for the purposes of this

case that I am conceding it, your Honor.
Q

Do you feel bound by the Poliak case in that

regard?
MR. DEBEVOISE:

The reasoning behind conceding for

this case is, we are a very-heavily-regulated industry.
do have a very Important role to play.

We

We do take our

orders from the state, the state courts, the federal
agencies, this Court and we try to do things correctly.
Our image before the public Is, as Justice
Brandeis pointed out, Is all-important.
way of making money.

We have only one

That is to sell electricity.

We don't

cut anybody off unreasonably if we can help It.
On the other hand, we get absolutely no assistance
from any state or governmental agency in raising the funds
necessary to carry on this business.
If a court or a state tells us, this is how you
do it, once we have exhaused our protection, we will do it
that way.
Q

Wow, that was Justice White's, what you took to

be Justice White's hypothetical but what I understood him to
say was not his hypothetical.

Situation A, where the

utility says, "you do it," where the utility commission says,
"You do it this way.

Don't give any hearings and collect

37
the back bills.

You have no choice."

And the second one,

which was his hypothetical, is where the utility commission
basically leaves it up to the utility.

He says, one is

permissible, but maybe the other may be too.
MR. DEBEVOISE:

Well, that to me is nonaction and

I am sorry if I misunderstood.
Q

Well, my example simply was if they filed a tariff

and there is litigation about the validity of the termination
rule and the commission says, this is perfectly consistent
with the state law.
but you may.

We don’t require you to do it this way

We approve the tariff.

MR. DEBEVOISE:
Justice White.
Q

I think that still is nonaction,

Excuse me, I thought they were directing it.

No, no, they just approved it.

But they did.

There was the affirmative approval of the tariff.
MR. DEBEVOISE:

But not saying that is the way

you construe it.
Q

No, you could file another tariff if you wanted

to but this — and, of course, they say, now that you have
filed it,

you must follow it.

I mean, that is what a

tariff is, isn't It?
MR. DEBEVOISE:

Right.

Right.

But, excuse me, I

missed your innuendo.
Q

That’s all right.
MR. DEBEVOISE:

And In VErmont, and I think the

38
Vermont case last week Is Interesting, the Supreme Court
reversed the public utility commission where they had set
up procedures —
Q

Did you read this in the newspaper?
MR. DEBEVOISE:

Unfortunately, your Honor, it was

late last week in Miami.
Q

Well, is that hearsay?

Q

It is a court decision in Vermont.
MR. DEBEVOISE:

Q

Or what?

It’s a court decision —

It’s reported out of a newspaper and I think he

should say that it is reported out of a newspaper.
MR. DEBEVOISE:

Well, It is the Rutland Herald of

last week, your Honor, reporting the motion by Vermont
Welfare Rights Organization asking the Supreme Court to
*
reconsider Its decision voiding the policy of the public
service board In connection with termination procedures.
And the only reason that the court voided it was
because the public service commission had proceeded without
any

factual basis. In the record.

It had not held hearings

to determine the circumstances and therefore had no findings
in support of their order,
There is no question that the public service
commission can direct these things after hearings, like the
New York Public Service Commission has done.
That is the utility’s protection.

If they are

39
toldj do something this way, the regulatory agency has to
have support on a basis because the utility is entitled to
due process, too.
So, in this case, our position is that there has
to be affirmative action directing.

Then, if we act under

color of that directive, we are subject.
In connection vrith this grant
Q

Mr. Debevoise, before you move on, I want to see

clear, do I understand that you drew a distinction between
ordering and approving?
MR. DEBEVOISE:
Q

Yes, I do.

Now, Justice White suggested approval could

indicate that this procedure is all right and some

other

procedure also may be all right.
MR. DEBEVOISE:
Q

Right.

In that circumstance, you would say, no state

action.
MR. DEBEVOISE:

In the case that I can visualise

at the moment, Justice Powell, I would, yes,

I mean, if it

Is a question of. in a tariff, when It is accepted or
approved, your description of service is in there.

The

office at which you collect your bills and just lots and
lots of material that is in this category that would be
subject to change by filing a new tariff and it would only
be if you were doing something unreasonable that a commission

40
would then come along and say, you must change the tariff
and do It this way and then I say, they would be directing.
So just their acceptance for filing or approval, I
itfould equate with nonaction.
Q

In other words, any kind of action that was

consistent with state law and in one sense wouldn't have the
approval of state law would be state action?
MR. DEBEVOISE:

Exactly.

Exactly.

In all of the

regulated businesses, and there are very, very few
businesses that are not regulated to some degree today,
whether they are corporations or individuals.
Nov;, I believe I have covered our main points
that we, unfortunately, don't believe this is a termination
case because the Petitioner was not our customer.

She

didn't apply for new service for herself, so it Is not an
equal protection case.
t

Q

Wouldn’t you say, Mr. Debevolse, though, that the

order -- that the state has ordered the company to furnish
electricity?
MR. DEBEVOISE:

I believe that there is no right

to receive electric service, except under -—
Q

Well, isn’t there a statutory obligation on the

company to furnish electricity?
MR. DEBEVOISE:
Q

There is a statutory —•

Without discrimination and without —

41
MR. DEBEVOISE:

Exactly, I was going to say,

except under the Equal Protection Clause,
Now, if we discriminated against her as opposed to
any other person who applied for service, I believe that
there would be a cause under the Equal Protection clause,
as the Davis V/. Weir case was holding this summer.

But there

is nothing —
Q

It would be only if you were a state.

Q

Right.

Q

The Equal Protection Clause doesn’t apply to

private action, private individuals.
MR. DEBEVOISE:
with a municipal company.

Right.

And there we are dealing

But there is no right, nothing to

force the company to extend the electric service, except
within the bounds of the tariff.
Q

But if they — well, all right, but if they, if a

person is willing to live up to the rules of the company,
that the company has put out in his tariff, there is a
statutory obligation to furnish service.
MR. DEBEVOISE:

ONce — once we have hooked some­

body up, accepted somebody as a customer, there is a
statutory obligation for reasonably continuous service, I
think It is.

That is correct.

Now, that obligation, however, is subject to
termination if, when we supply service, we are not then paid

42
for it.
Q

You are saying that a state may order a company

to furnish electricity and the company can go ahead and be
carrying out its statutory obligation to furnish elec­
tricity and then the state may permit the

termination

without notice.
MR. DEBEVOISE:

I believe that is correct, your

Honor, because the state can only order us to supply
electricity within the context of the rights of the
utilities.

It cannot order us to supply electricity to

customers and receive no compensation for it.
Q

Well, it could, I suppose, order you to give

hearings before termination.
MR. DEBEVOISE:

1 believe that the public service

commission could—
Q

Yes, yes.
MR. DEBEVOISE:

Q

~ direct that.

So that It wouldn’t be violating any rights of

yours if they ordered it.
MR. DEBEVOISE:

As long as we have an opportunity

to receive payment.
Q

Yes.

Q

This would be one of the conditions of your

franchise then, in effect, would it not?
MR. DEBEVOISE:

Yes.

We would have an opportunity

^3
to build before the commission a record on which they would
base a decision as to any deviation from our present
practice.
I believe that I have given you our position.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you,

Mr. Debevoise.
Mr. Greenberg5 you have three minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JACK GREENBERG, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GREENBERG:

If It please the Court,

I would submit that the state action issue in the
case is really no issue at all.

I can't imagine for a

moment that anyone would say that it is not state action
if the electric company decided that it was not going to
furnish electricity to black people or not going to furnish
electricity to Mexicans.
I think the state action question is manifest.
The issue Is, what happens upon a finding and a
recognition of the obvious existence of state action in
this case?
Now, there has been some talk about Public
Utilities Commission against Poliak and how this case was
different because the —
Q

You would say if the utility refused to furnish

electricity to negroes that it could be sued for damages

44
under 1983?

,

MR. GREENBERGYes.
Q

Because?
MR. GREENBERG:

of the law.
Q

It had denied equal protection

It’s the same basis of —

Well, there is state action, but the question is

whether the state denied equal protection of the lav/.
is the 14th Amendment.
tection of the law.

The state has to deny equal pro­

This just isn't state action.

MR. GREENBERG:
Q

That

It is state action and —

That never was indicated.

As a matter of fact,

the state said, serve everybody equally and the company
disobeys the statute and refuses to serve negroes.
MR. GREENBERG:

Well, in Screws against the United

States, the state lav/ said the sheriff wasn't allowed to
beat people up.

But if this utility had, as part of its

tariffs, the right to use force and violence to go and read
a meter and collect a bill, I would assume that that
utility meter reader and bill collector, acting pursuant to
a tariff, would be engaged in state action and the utility
would be liable for — under the Civil Rights Act.
Q

In Screws

you are talking about a government

official, by definition, a sheriff.
MR. GREENBERG:
state law.

Yes, but he v/as acting contrary to

I assume that v/as the —

45
Q

Now, you say if the meter reader beats up the

householder, he is liable to 1983 —
MR. GREENBERG:

If he is doing it pursuant to a

tariff approved by the public utilities commission saying
that —
Q

Now, wait.

He is doing it contrary to the tariff.

MR. GREENBERG:

No, the tariff authorizes him to

use force.
Q

So every meter reader is an agent of the state?

In your book.
MR. GREENBERG:

No.

I am assuming a tariff which

authorzies the meter reader to use self-help in order to
carry out the policies and the —
Q

Well, your argument under Screws, it would be

true even if he was ordered not to.

But he nevertheless

did.
MR. GREENBERG:

Yes, but I was

responding to the

suggestion that he might be acting contrary to state law.
To turn to the Poliak case for a moment, this case
is Indeed quite like the Poliak case because Respondent's
brief demonstrates that 1971 and 1972 tariffs, including
this particular regulation as promulgated, after a hearing,
addressed to the question of rates.

But the rates and the

termination procedures were a part of the same regulations
which were promulgated and the company makes a point — and

I think correctly so — saying that its termination
procedures and its rates are inextricably intertwined.
termination procedures determine its costs of collection
and the — its credit practices and so forth.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you,

Mr. Greenberg.
Thank you, Mr, Debevoise.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:46 o’clock a.m., the case
was submitted.]
