PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Jo. 73-820, United States against
Guana-Sanchez.
Mr. Friedman, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL L. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Chief

Justice and may it

Please the Court:
This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.
Respondent was charged In a one-count indictment
filed in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois with having knowingly and
unlawfully transported three aliens within the United States
in violation of Title 8 United States Code Section 1324(a)(2).
He filed a pretrial motion to suppress evidence,
alleging that he and his three passengers had been
Illegally arrested while in his car and that the government's
evidence depended upon the testimony of the passengers,
which he said was the fruit of the illegal arrests.
ihe District Court granted the motion to suppress
the statements made by the passengers and their future
testimony at Respondent's trial.

The government appealed the decision and the Court
of Appeals affirmed the District Court with one judge
dissenting.
QUESTION:

These prejudiced statements made, when

and where were they made?

You are going to get to that, I

guess.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes, I am going to go through the

facts in some detail because I think it is very important to
the resolution of the case.
The issue on which we petitioned is whether a
defendant has standing to suppress statements in future
testimony of witnesses on the ground that they were unlawfullyarrested while passengers in his automobile.
The statements, I might say, took place later when
they got down to the police station but the fact of the
suppression hearing, briefly, show the following — I might
add that they came solely from a police officer, he being the
only witness at the suppression hearing.
He testified that he, Officer Pat

Vincent Tenuto,

was a police officer in the village of Villa Park, Illinois,
some 17 miles west of Chicago, that that was a small village
of 25 or 30,000 people, about half residential and half
industrial and that the industry consisted of small factories
and businesses.
He also testified that the factories, some of them,

5
often looked for cheap labor and he related three experiences
of his own when he was involved in helping to check out
some individuals who turned out to be illegal entrants from
Mexico who had apparently come to the area to work in the
factories.
In each case those people had no identifications,
spoke no English and they arrived in the area either by
car or bus or truck.
Now, on this particular night, he and his partner,
at about 2:30 in the morning, did not stop a vehicle.

They

saw a vehicle already stopped, pulled over to the side of
the road in a vacant lot at an intersection about 15 0r 20
miles [sic] off the road.
The lights of the car — the headlights were on.
The interior dome light was on.
The officers went over to see if they could be of
assistance, to see if these people were lost.

It appeared

to them that the driver was looking at a piece of paper
which may have been a map and, indeed, when they drove over
to the car, they saw Respondent sitting behind the steering
wheel on the driver's side looking at an Illinois road map.
Three other people were in the car, one beside the
driver on the front seat, two in the back seat.
On the floor of the car were three shopping bags
containing what appeared to be items of clothing.

The

6
officers, before talking to the Respondent and his passengers,
radioed in their location to headquarters and radioed in the
license tag number of the car.
Officer Hall went over to the driver's side.,
Officer Tenudo to the passenger's side.

Officer Hall asked

the Respondent if they could be of any help, what the problem
was.

Respondent said that they were looking for a restaurant

owned by a friend but he didn't know the name of the res­
taurant.

If they couldn't find that restaurant, they were

looking for another restaurant, which he did name.
One of the officers radioed in to some of the
neighboring towns and from those towns found out, at least,
i.hat the restaurants in the area closed by midnight or 1:00
o clock, although not necessarily all the restaurants closed
by midnight or 1:00 o'clock.
At this point, Officer Hall asked Respondent for
some identification.

He showed the officer what appeared to

be an apparently valid Illinois driver's license.
Now, either at about that same time or later when
they got back to the station, although we don't think it is
particularly important which, the radio dispatcher informed
the oxxicers that they had checked out the license tag
number.

The car belonged to the same individual whose name

appeared on the license.

The car was not stolen.

wanted in connection with any particular crime.

It was not

7
The officer, after checking the driver's license,
asked the passengers for identification.

They shrugged

their shoulders as if they didn’t understand the question.
The officer repeated the question.
same response.

He got the

He then asked the driver —

QUESTION :

What was the question?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

The question to the passengers

was, "Do you have any identification?" And the passengers
indicated by gesture that they didn’t understand.
He then, the officer, asked Respondent whether he
spoke Spanish.
QUESTION:

The Respondent was the driver.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

The Respondent was the driver.

The other three passengers in his car; he asked him if he
spoke Spanish and if he would ask the passengers for
identification.
j.he Respondent said something to the three passen~
gers in a language the officers did not understand.

They

assumed it to be Spanish.
In response to the Respondent's Inquiry, two
people In the back shook their heads back and forth as if to
indicate no, they had no identification, assuming that was
the question asked by the driver.
The gentleman in the front seat handed the officers
a little card written in a foreign language which appeared to

8
be Spanish.

The officers couldn’t read it except to make

out three words, "Army," '’Military” and "Mexico."

They

assumed that that — they concluded that that meant it was
an army identification card from Mexico.
They called their Sergeant.

The Sergeant arrived

a few minutes later, through Respondent asked the two
passengers in the back seat, the two without identification,
to get out of the car

and to come to the police station.

They placed them in a police vehicle to transport
them to the station.
At that point, Officer Hall asked Respondent if he
wouldn’t mind coming to the station while a check was done on
the two persons without identification.
"Fine.

I will come with you."

Respondent answered

And, along with the passenger

who had shown identification, he followed the officers to
the station in his own car.
At no time prior to the trip to the station did
any police officer enter the car or search the car and when
they got to the station, the Sergeant asked the three
passengers, again through Respondent, if they would write
down on a piece of paper their names and their ages.
He then called the local office of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service to run a name check on these
three people and Chief Parton of that Service asked to speak
with the three passengers.

9
He spoke with each of them in Spanish, or xdiat
sounded to the officers to be Spanish, and after speaking
with them, told the Sergeant to hold up all four men until
morning because the three men

had admitted that they were

in the country illegally.
Now, just to round out the picture of what
happened at the hearing, in response to some hypothetical
questions from Court and Counsel, the officer testified that
if Respondent had driven off without asking permission,
after having shown his driver's license, but with the
unidentified persons still in the car, he would have been
stopped.
He also testified, however, that if he had
refused to come to the station when asked, Respondent would
have been free to leave, his license having been checked
out and there being no further reason to detain him.
QUESTION:

That is, free to leave alone.

MR. FRIEDMAN:
passengers.

The —

Free to leave alone, not with his

At least, that is certainly the implication of

the officer's answer.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

And our — the inference we draw

from those two inquiries * answers is that he would have been
detained had he tried to leave with the passengers because
they hadn't been checked out but he would have been free to

10

leave alone.
Now, the District Court granted the motion to
suppress.

He found that the license check was reasonable

but anything thereafter was unreasonable, no justification to
detain them further* and to interrogate the passengers.
He found that the interrogation constituted a
search of the car, even though the passengers were in plain
view and solely for the purposes of challenging that finding
and that some illegality flowed from it, we assumed arguendo
in the Court of Appeals that it was a search but that the
xtfhole incident at the car was lawful.
And he also said that the arrests of Respondent and
his passengers were unlawful and that everything that flowed
were fruits and should be suppressed.
Now the Court of Appeals affirmed.
What it did, and we think It is important for
analysis, is it said there were three steps in the facts as
they developed.

The first step was the license check and

that v?as perfectly reasonable and justified.
The second step was the period beginning —QUESTION:

That is the check of the driver's

license —
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

Of the driver's license.

— of the Respondent alone.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

The Respondent's license alone.

11

The second step, according to the Court of Appeals,
began when the driver was given his license back and every­
thing else that happened at the car, the interrogation of
the passengers, was the second step, said the Court of
Appeals.
And the third step was the period beginning with
the trip to the police station.
Now, the problem as the case comes here, we think,
is that while the Court said the first

step was reasonable

and the third step wasn't, it didn't talk about the second
step.

It moved Immediately to the third step and said that

that was an unlawful arrest, taking them to the station,
that Respondent was unlawfully arrested and that everything
that floxved was fruits of that.
Now, the

dissenting judge, also addressing himself

to that, first said that he thought everything was reasonable
but then went on to say, if we are talking about the
Respondent's arrest, REspondent has got no standing because
nothing flowed from that and, secondly, that even assuming
some illegality, live witness testimony should be treated
differently for purposes of the exclusionary rule from
inanimate objects.
QUESTION:
arrest.
isn't it?

Now, you speak

of the Respondent’s

It Is your position the Respondent was not arrested,

12
MR. FRIEDMAN:

It is our position that — we are

talking about when they left the car.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

It is our position that Respondent

was not arrested but that even if he was, there were no
fruits of his arrest.

The only fruits in this case come

from the arrests, if they were arrests and we are not sure
that they were arrests

either, frankly.

Me think it may

have been a reasonable detention in the circumstances or that
it may have been an arrest on probable cause.

But in any

event, anything that flowed, the statements and the future
testimony of the witnesses, flowed from the arrests of the
passengers, not the arrest of Respondent.
And that is essentially the only question on which
we petition the Court and the only question that we think it
is necessary to decide because any illegality in that second
step which Respondent talks about in his brief was not
directly addressed by the Court of Appeals.
We think it might be appropriate to let that court
address it first, although we also think it Is Inferable from
the Court's opinion that everything in that second step was
also reasonable because It said the only illegality that held
that the only thing that was illegal were the arrests, taking
them down to the station.
QUESTION:

Let me see if I have the facts clear now.

13
Only the two passengers from the rear seat of the car who
did not have identification were asked to --- were taken in
a police car to the station.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

And the man who had —

the passenger

who had identification and the driver followed in their car.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Was a police officer placed in their

car?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, he was not.

Well, essentially, as I said, there are no fruits
of Respondent's arrest, if we deal solely with that third
step in the facts.
No statements were made by Respondent.
came from Respondent.

No evidence

Nothing was seized from Respondent.

And I think the Court of Appeals made its mistake
in isolating xvhat were four separate human beings in looking
at what happened to each of
QUESTION:

those separate human beings.

Well, aren't you assuming something,

t hough, that the officers had the right to hold the
Respondent after he had identified himself?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

And

Well

—

showed that he had his proper

Let's assume that he had been alone in the car and

they came and asked him to identify himself.

They would let

14
him go right away.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

'They would let him go right away.

So that you are assuming that when you

stop — if the officer was entitled to go over and ask some­
body driving a car to identify himself and

show his license,

you are assuming that they a3.so have the right to have the
passengers identify themselves.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

We are assuming that it is reasonable

to ask the passengers in the car to identify themselves.
QUESTION:

Yes.

Well, let’s assume that it is not.

Assume that it was not proper to do that.

Then you have held

the driver of the car beyond the time when you are -- beyond
the time that you should be able to hold him, in which event,
arguably, you have a fruit of an illegality with respect to
him if you go ahead and interrogate the passengers.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
being held at all.

Well, we would not concede he was

There is nothing to say that he couldn’t

have left at that point.
QUESTION:

Well, you have already said you wouldn’t

let him go.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, what the officer said, in his

testimony is that he wouldn’t be permitted to leave so long
as the passengers were still with him.
QUESTION:

Exactly.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Exactly.

But If the passengers had been

15
separated —
QUESTION:
let's just assume.

Let73 assume, thogh — no, let's —
I am not saying this Is so.

Assume you

had no business with the passengers and that you do with
and to the passengers is illegal.
Let's just assume that.
And that you have no business holding the driver
in order to Interrogate or to get the passengers out of his
car.
Now, just assume that.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, I think it is difficult to

assume that you have no business holding him for the brief
time it would take to get them out of his ear.
I think that what could easily happen is — is the
officers saying, "We have business with the passengers."

QUESTION:

Well, he is supposed to be able to

drive away as soon as he identifies himself and you said,
"No, just hold on a minute.
else here.

We are going to do something

With your — with something In your car.

It

may be bodies, but we are going to get something out of
your car.”
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, if four people are walking

16

dox-m the street and there Is reason to arrest three of them,
you can take those three people and separate them from the
other individuals.
Now, it doesn’t seem to us any different if four
people happen to be in a car.

Does it mean that if there is

reason to arrest three of them, you have to arrest all four
of them just because they happen —
QUESTION:

Of course, you don’t even get to this

question if you have some right -- if you have some proper
business with the passengers.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

Well —

And that you may hold the driver while

you complete your business with the passengers.
Now, what authority do you have for that?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, we think that the right to go

up to some individuals, whether they be on the street or in
an automobile and ask them some questions — there is a
footnote in Terry versus Ohio.

I don’t think you need

reasonable suspicion to do that.
QUESTION:

Sure.

MR. FRIEDMAN :

That Is your concurring opinion in

Terry versus Ohio.
QUESTION:

What —now, you are dealing with an

automobile and you are holding one person while you complete
your business with another.

17
Now, give me some authority for that.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

There is a case in the -- there are

a number of auto stop cases, of course, but ~—
QUESTION:

It seems to me a rather fundamental

point in this case.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
point is in this case.

Well, we don’t think that that
We think that since the Court of

Appeals only dealt with the arrests —
QUESTION:

Otherwise, it seems — assuming that you

are dealing with the passengers —■ it is illegal, it seems
to me, whatever — whatever developed from the passengers
is, arguably at least, a fruit of detaining the driver.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, we think that the Court of

Appeals did not deal with anything that happened in that
car and say it was illegal.
Now, of course, this Court could do so if it
wanted to.

What it talked about was the arrest and what
•i

flowed from the arrests.

,

We say nothing flowed from the arrests.
Now, if we go back to step two, at the car, v/hat
flowed, flowed from the interrogation of the passengers.
QUESTION:

Let me ask you something else.

Suppose

that after you — when you got the passengers out of the
car, you saw a briefcase in the back of the car and you
reached —- and the officers reached in and got the briefcase

18

and it belonged to one of the passengers and they opened it
right then and there and it incriminated the driver?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Then., we think it is certainly

arguable that he has got standing to complain.
QUESTION:

I would think he **ould.

Yes, I would

think he would because he is — because they had invaded his
car and, in effect, seized something out of his car which is
a protected area.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

All right, the car is a protected

area and
QUESTION:

Isn’t that illustrated clearly in this

case because when they got to the police station, they found
a revolver in the glove compartment of the car, presumably
belonging to the driver, but the government never sought to
use that as evidence so far as this case is concerned.
Is that not correct?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That is correct.

And so far as we

know, he was never charged with that.
QUESTION:

And It can be reasonably assumed, can’t

It, that someone concluded that that pistol fit precisely
into what Mr. Justice White has just postulated, namely, they
had come into the possession of that pistol by invading the
privacy of the driver’s car?
QUESTION:

Well, let’s assume ~~ assume police

19
kncwing that a henchman of his is there and they arrest the
henchman.

They take him out of the house.

They entered the

He

incriminates the owner of the house.
Now, can you use his statements?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I am not sure that the answer to

that is clear because I think you then get to this whole
question —
QUESTION:
that

Well, it seems to me you have to say

they can use it because they seized these passengers

out of this man’s car here.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
out of the car.

Oh, I don’t think they seized them

They didn’t go into the car as they go into

the house in your example.
They asked people to get out of the car.

They

have a right to arrest people whether they be on the street
or in the car if there is probable cause.
They have a right to interrogate people whether
they be on the street or in the car, if there is reasonable
suspicion or, in the case of a license check, maybe even if
there is not reason for suspicion.
QUESTION:

Nobody has suggested that you have got

probable cause to have arrested those people or to take them
to arrest them on the spot at all.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, I am perfectly willing to

20

suggest that, although I don’t think It is important in this
case.
I think that everything the police did, step by
step, was reasonable on the facts of this case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Friedman, how long was this period

of time?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

They stopped the car at 2:30 a.m.

And all these times were accurate because they are recorded
in the radio log.
2:^7 a.m.

They were down to the police station by

So it is 17 minutes for the entire process to

iind out that they were illegally in the country.
But the only —
QUESTION:

superior officer and it was
MR. FRIEDMAN:

He called the

only 17 minutes?

That is correct.

At 2:33 — 2:30

they saw the car, 2:33 they drove to where the ear was
parked.

At 2:37 the sergeant was on the scene already and at

2:47 they were at the police station — 2:46, 16 minutes.
Now, the radio log, which was put in evidence, I
believe, by the Defendant at the hearing, corroborates all
of those times, the very short period of time that we are
talking about.
QUESTION:

17 minutes.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

It is a small town and it is not that

far from the police station, apparently.

21

QUESTION:

You got more than one building in the

town?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

Well —

That Is the Respondent's evidence,

isn't it?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

The radio log, yes.

Yes, so that's

The radio log is the Respondent's?

Who kept the radio log?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, the police kept it, to my

recollection.
I'm sorry.
QUESTION:
evidence.

I am advised that I am wrong.
You said the Respondent put it into

Is that not correct?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I am told that that is not correct.

I think where I got confused was, we have had some dis­
agreements during the litigation about what the log said
about when the radio report came back but, all right, the
government put it in.
QUESTION:

I am still, in my own mind, confused

about the right to question these people.
The man in the front seat shotted identification
for Mexico and yet that was satisfactory.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, I would say, you know, it

is not entirely clear that it is satisfactory.
QUESTION:

Well, they turned him loose.

22
HR. FRIEDMAN:

But — well, in fact, I would have

to say that the record is unclear whether they would have
turned him loose.
QUESTION:

Well, didn’t —

MR. FRIEDMAN:
loose.

They would have turned the driver

They asked the driver to follow them.

him into a police vehicle.

They asked

They didn't take

I don’t think that the evidence

makes clear what they would have done if the man with the
Mexican i.d. card wanted to leave but their purpose, they
say — and it is uncontradicted — was to check out the
other two people in the back who had no identification, at
least to the same extent that they checked out the man in
the front seat and they to take him down to the station to
do it.

Now —
QUESTION:

Well, when they checked, did they put

all three names in, or two?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

When they checked with Immigration

Naturalization, they gave them all three names and they had
all three —
QUESTION:

So he was in custody, wasn’t he?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I think that it is arguable that al

three of them were in custody.
Nov;, the question is, were they lawfully in
custody or not, if you want to get to that point and if it

23
was reasonable to do the license check and if it was
reasonable to ask the passengers for identification, then,
given the fact that they spoke no English, given the fact
that they were Mexican-appearing, given the fact that there
were these bags of clothing in the car, given the fact it
was 2:30 in the morning in an exclusively industrial area
and given the officers prior experience in similar situations,
we think step-by-step it was reasonable.

The intrusions

were minimal into these peoples' privacy and they were
checking out identification, asking for a name and address,
at least a plurality of the Court once said in, I think,
Deyers versus California, asking for a name and address is
essentially a neutral act.
There are other cases.

I mention Miranda in the

concurring opinion and the footnote in Terry or Miranda
itself and Terry in a concurring opinion, asking questions
of people on the street, to get identification — Adams
versus Williams — is a reasonable act.
Mow, how and what the quantum of — of facts one
has to have as a police officer to ask those questions is a
sliding scale and if you look at this thing step-by-step,
we think everything that they did was reasonable.
QUESTION:
issue

Well, you said at the outset that the

in this case is a narrow one, namely, the standing of

the driver to claim the benefit of some violations of the

24
passengers' rights.

You haven't spent much time on that.

MR. FRIEDMAN:
narrow issue.

Well, we still think it is that

If you focus on step 3 we think it is pretty

clear that the arrests of the four individuals — assuming
they were arrested — or the detention should be viexued
separately and everything that flowed, flowed from the
"arrests," putting it in quotes for now, of the

of the

passengers, not of the driver, their statements, their
future testimony flowed from that.
Had they been — had the driver been arrested
separately, there would have been no fruits.
Had the passengers been arrested separately, and
everything else followed the way it did here, clearly the
driver would have no standing even though they incriminated
him.
We think the dissenting judge summed it up pretty
well when he said that — well, the passengers may have been
aggrieved, the driver was not and the driver has no interest
in the bodies or the minds of his passengers.
That, we think, is the narrow issue before the
Court.
Should the Court feel it appropriate to get into
that second stage which the Court of Appeals identified but
did not discuss, we think there are three independent reasons
which would support the reversal.

One, that everythinp: was reasonable and I talked
about that briefly in capsulized form.
Two, that the same standing principles applied
here would lead one to the conclusion that the Respondent
still has no standing.

Everything flowed from the passengers.

His rights were not infringed —
QUESTION:

Are you talking about the step two?

MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

That —

MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

Step two.

If we want to talk about step two.

All right.

I'm not talking about it.

I just asked what you were talking about.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, I am talking about it because

I think that some people would like to talk about it.
If we talk about that, we still think the same
standing principles would preclud him from being heard and
complaining about this and we also think at that point it
may be appropriate, although we don't think it is necessary,
to get to this question which we mentioned in the footnote
and which the dissenting judge discussed and which the Chief
Justice discussed in numerous opinions when on'the Court of
Appeals and that is that live witnesses ought to be treated
differently from inanimate objects.
That is, essentially, our position.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

26
ORAL ARGUMENT OP JOSEPH BEELER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. BEELER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it Please

the Court:
This case arises out of the Villa Park, Illinois
night-time practice and procedure of demanding satisfactory
proof of identity from everyone encountered in that suburb
in an automobile and taking those persons who can’t produce
the requested identity documents to the police station to
see whether or not they may be criminals.
Frankly, I am a little disappointed that the
Government didn't address this problem a little bit more
carefully because here we have an extraordinary dragnet
procedure which I think poses grave threats to Fourth
Amendment rights.
The routine in this case is so comprehensive that
the police in Villa Park would stop and demand proof of
identity and take people to the jail to see if they might be
criminals if they were merely encountered at the side of the
road changing an obvious flat tire.
That is the kind of practice that we are dealing
with in this case.
QUESTION:

Well, there is no indication that if

the occupants of this car or any car had given their identity
and it had checked out, that they would have been taken to

2?
any stationhouse, is there?
MR. BEELER:

I think it is clear from the testimony

in the case that if everyone in the car, that is, all four
passengers, had had identity documents satisfactory to the
police officers, then they could have continued on their
business'.
QUESTION:

In this case we are dealing with

passengers who could not speak English against the background
of — so the record indicates — a number of employers in
that community hiring an illegal Mexican alien.

So that is

another element to be taken into account, isn’t it?
We aren’t concerned in this case with what they
have been doing in some other cases with English-speaking
passengers who are changing tires.

'We are concerned with

Spanish-speaking passengers at 2:30 :.n the morning, aren’t we?
MR. BEELER:

Precisely and I think it is important

that the Court take careful note of how it was that the
Spanish identity of these passengers was learned.
If this was something -chat was paraded from the
outside of the car, something the police knew before they
began their investigation and before they detained Mr. Sanchez
then, perhaps, assuming that there had been some evidence in
this case that the police officers were authorized to enforce
immigration lav/s and I point out that District Court Judge
Held on that holding has not been overturned, nor has the

28
Government challenged it here.
Illinois police officers are not vested with
authority to Investigate immigration offenses.
I think that if Officer Tenuto had any competence
or experience that was meaningful in investigating immigra­
tion offenses, if he knew a few simple things like whether
Puerto Ricans are American citizens or not, if he were able
to recognize Mexicans, but his own testimony was that he
couldn’t recognize Mexicans.

He couldn’t recognize

Spanish.
Well, we have the circumstance here that because
this is an immigration offense doesn’t change things very
much.
I’d mention the fact that the police learned that
this was a group of four people, three of whom were Mexican
aliens, after the police encounter began.
The Government, in its statement of facts, suggests
that there is a question as to when the police radio report
came back from the radio dispatcher indicating that
Mr. Sanchez was the owner of the motor vehicle and that the
motor vehicle was not stolen or wanted in connection with
any crime.
I think that the record couldn’t be clearer.
After all, the Government’s own witness, Mr. Tenuto
testified that it came back immediately but at the time

29
that Mr. Sanchez' driver's license liras returned to him, the
police knew that there was absolutely no suspicion connected
with this car.
I would point out that — I believe it is footnote
9 of our-brief — deals extensively with this problem, but
this is an argument which the Government has raised for the
first time in the Supreme Court on its brief on the merits.
It has never raised the question below as to when
this radio report came back and I think the Court, for
purposes of this argument, at least until it can examine the
footnote carefully, should assume that the police had no
reasonable suspicion whatsoever as to the car and whatever
reasonable suspicion they may have had initially had been
dispelled.
They had returned the driver's license, yet,
rather than let Mr. Sanchez drive on, as he was entitled to,
they testified that if he had attempted to leave at that
time, they would have chased after him and pulled him off
again.
It was then, after he was detained in what we
submit is a clear violation of Terry versus Ohio since there
was no basis whatsoever for the detention.
they

It was then that

asked the passengers if they wouldn't produce i.d. also

and it was then and only then that they learned that these
individuals didn't speak English.

30

This flowed from the detention of Mr. Sanchez.
This is the second stage which the Government
doesn't want to talk about but this is what the Defendant
has been arguing ever since the District Court.
We have not changed our argument one whit.

The

Government, I think it will be demonstrated, has been all
over the lot.
The Defendant in this

case has standing which is

the only issue presented in the cert petition because
Mr. Sanchez' own personal constitutional rights were
violated.
He has a right to use the public highways free of
temporary detention.

Those rights were violated when he

wasn’t free to move on as a direct result of this dragnet
police practice in violation of his rights —
QUESTION:

What do you mean when you say — you

don't mean to lay down any absolute principle that he has
the right to use the public highways free of any detention
whatsoever, do you?
MR. BEELER:

What I am talking about, he has the

right to use the public highways, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,
subject to the dictates of the Fourth Amendment which not
only give him protection but also permit reasonable police
inquiry.
The Government, in its cert petition, abandoned

31
their argument below, as I read the cert petition and as I
read the brief on the merits, the Government made no argument
that they could justify this detention under Terry versus
Ohio or Adams

versus Williams.

The first time that I've heard that argument in
this Court was a few minutes ago when Mr. Friedman brought
it up.

I'd point out that the Government is here as the

Petitioner.

They were in the Court of Appeals as the

Appellee and they lost in the District Court where they had
the burden of justifying a warrantless arrest.
QUESTION:
here,

Well, what you are complaining about

what your client is complaining about, is that the

two passengers in the back seat of the car testified in
Sanchez1 trial that he had smuggled them across the border
and into the United States.
Isn't that what you are complaining about?
MR. BEELER:

The Government's proposed testimony

is that these three witnesses who were found in his car
will be — would be used against him to establish the elements
of harboring or transporting.
QUESTION:

I didn't think there was any testimony.

I think there was a motion to suppress and it was granted.
QUESTION:
MR. BEELER:

It was granted.
That is accurate.

That is the pro­

posed testimony should this Court reverse the judgment below.

32
QUESTION:

What you are complaining about is — or

the Government is resisting is the fact that these witnesses
vrere not permitted to testify that he had smuggled them in.
MR. BEELER:
Mr. Chief Justice.

I don’t believe that is accurate,

The Government would like to argue that,

I believe, in some other case.
Their cert petition says that the question in
this case is standing and they state expressly in their
cert petition that this case does not represent an
appropriate vehicle for determining the question which I
think you might be getting at, which is when or whether
the fruit — rather, when or whether the testimony of a
witness discovered during an illegal search or detention
is fruit of the poisonous tree.
And I think the reason the Government has backed
away from that issue in their moving papers will be under­
stood if I could read an excerpt from the Government’s
brief in the Court of Appeals.
This is page 78 — I'm sorry, 77 of the Appendix
where the Government made the only argument that they made
in the Court of Appeals and that is, that the police
procedure in this case was lawful and proper; it was a
justified extension of Terry versus Ohio and Adams versus
Williams and they made the argument in the context of saying
that the brief questioning was either

a valid investigatory

33
stop or an illegal search-

And here is what they said.

This is the very first sentence in their very first para­
graph:

"The Government assumes, for purposes of this appeal,

that the questioning of the passengers in Defendant’s car
constituted a search of the car to which Defendant has
standing

to object."
The Government also concedes that the testimony of

witnesses discovered during illegal search can be suppressed
as to a person has standing to object to the search.
The issue presented to this Court is whether the
questioning of the passengers while they were in Defendant's
car, constituted an illegal search or whether it was a
proper and valid investigatory stop.
QUESTION:

You don't suggest that this Court is now

bound by what an Assistant United States Attorney argued in
the Court of Appeals, do you?
MR. BEELER:

X am not suggesting that but I think

the litigation posture in which this case appears is
important.
QUESTION:

You do not agree, then, that the basic

issue here is standing?
MR. BEELER:

I agree, the

basic issue here is

standing but I understand the question of standing to be one,
whether or not the Defendant’s constitutional rights, his
own personal constitutional rights were violated by the

34
police procedure and having established in the District
Court and the Court of Appeals and the Government’s brief
on the merits that there was no proper basis for the police
conduct here and I think it Is being almost indisputable
that Mr. Sanches was detained so that this police procedure
could be carried out.
I think that this establishes standing.

His rights

were violated.
QUESTION:

Has any — do you cite us any case in

which the testimony of witnesses such as these two passengers
in the car has been excluded or suppressed because of the
violation of the rights, constitutional rights of some other
person?

Tnat is, in this case, the driver.

Is there any

parallel case that you —
MR. BEELER:

Well, if I understand your

question

accurately, you are bringing us into the area of cases
whj.ch seem co take a case-by-case analysis to the question
of whether or not a particular witness’ testimony is fruit of
the poisonous tree where that witness was discovered as a
result of some police illegality.
QUESTION:

Tucker against Michigan involved that

and one such case, in answer to the Chief Justice’s question
would be the decision of the Michigan Supreme Court in the
Tucker case, wouldn't It?
MR. BEELER:

The Tucker case was a Fifth Amendment

35
case,
QUESTION:

I know.

MR. BEELER:

In which the compulsion is an important

question and that is the harm that the Court is trying to
safeguard against and that is an instance.
QUESTION:

And what happened to the Tucker case?

MR. BEELER:

Well, in ^he Tucker case, this Court

held that the witness who was — rather, whose identity was
learned as a result of the custodial interrogation which was
in no way compulsive, which was in no way in violation of
the Fourth Amendment, could be used because of its trust­
worthiness but it was not fruit of any compulsion because
no compulsion was present.
As a matter of fact, warnings were given in the
Tucker case.

There was just a technical breach of Miranda

versus Arizona.
QUESTION:

Is their any — do you make any argument

that the testimony of these two aliens in the back seat would
be unreliable evidence?
MR. BEELER:

I think that it might well be because

of the circumstances in which their custody was obtained and
the great interest that they would have in inculpating some­
one else in order to escape a liability themse3.ves.
But that is —- I think the compulsion and trust­
worthiness question is one which you worry about in a Fifth

36
Amendment case but in case after case of Fourth Amendment
violations the Court has excluded probitive evidence.
They have excluded heroin, guns, all manner of
physical evidence which certainly is more reliable than a
witness.
In answer to your question, Mr. Chief Justice
about cases in which witness’ testimony has been excluded,
I would refer to note 17 of the brief of the amici curiae
and also In our memorandum in opposition we listed a number
of cases but inasmuch as the Petition for Certiorari does
not raise the fruit question and inasmuch as the Government
didn't argue It, our brief on the merits doesn’t take up
that question.
However, to assume hypothetically that there is a
fruit of the poisonous tree question in front of this
Court, then I would point out that these particular witnesses
were not only discovered as a result of an Illegal detention
but during the very course of that detention, right — right
In the middle of the illegality, these witnesses and their
status as Spanish-speaking individuals, as people without
identification cards, was discovered.
Furthermore, these witnesses are really the crux
of the Government’s case.

He is charged with possessing

them, with transporting them within the United States.
The obtaining of these witnesses’ testimony came

37
about directly by exploitation of the illegality.

The dragnet

procedure in this case is directed purposefully at learning
about identity and finding criminals and I can't see a clear
connection between an illegal procedure and the evidence
being offered.
It is very difficult to see how the taint in this
case could have been purged.
Furthermore, these witnesses gave statements
immediately upon being brought to the police station.

There

were no intervening Miranda warnings and they were in
custody.
As a matter of fact, the record shows, the Govern­
ment has conceded and the Court of Appeals held

and the

District Court held that Mr. Sanchez, too, was arrested.
QUESTION:

But you can't insist that, on behalf of

Mr. Sanches that other people's testimony be suppressed
because those other people weren't given Miranda warnings,
can you?
MR. BEELER:

I mention the Miranda warnings simply

to show that the Government can’t argue that the statements
given by the aliens at the police station were voluntary,
were something that were a product of their individual will,
memory, perception, volition,
QUESTION:

factors — yes?

Well, do you say if a witness wasn't

given a Miranda warning, his statement by definition is not

38
voluntary, regardless of the circumstances?
MR. BEELER:

Not as a matter of law but I think

it bears persuasively upon any analysis as to whether or not
these witnesses, caught in a foreign country in the middle
of a crime, being interrogated by a professional interrogator
over the telephone, somehow came forth voluntarily to give
testimony which purged the taint of their being discovered
during the illegality.
Mr. Chief Justice Burger who was sitting then as
a judge in the Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia
in the case of Smith and Bowdin versus the United STates,
which is at 324 Federal 2nd, pointed out that the witness
discovered there at first wouldn't give any statements.

He

wouldn't cooperate and then later on he decided to cooperate
and this was seen as an intervening kind of factor.
But the Government, xtfhieh had the burden on this
question, put forward no evidence of an intervening guilty
plea, of an intervening voluntary confession or any other
independent source of this testimony.
If the testimony of a witness discovered during an
illegal search or detention can ever be suppressed as fruit
of the poisonous tree, why, then, we submit this is the case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Beeler, one of the problems I have

with this case is that, as you have pointed out, the
Government has changed its argumentative position.

39
You have been rather consistent in yours but
neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals accepted
either yours or the — or any versions of the Governments.
It had quite a different theory, as I understand it and I
want to be sure I understand yours and just tell me if it is
this, that you do not claim that the approach to the car,
parked as it was with the lights on, violated anybody's
constitutional rights; nor, indeed, the interrogation of
the driver to the extent that he was asked to provide
identification of himself, that that violated anybody’s
rights.
But your point is — and you tell me if I am
wrong — is that after he did so, then from then on, to
detain him and/or to search his car, violated his Fourth
and 14th Amendment rights.
MR. BEELER:

Is that it?

That’s it.

I would add one other

thing.
The District Court, as a matter of fact, did
adopt our theory and the District Court opinion, I believe,
represents the argument that we are making here.
QUESTION:

It was the Court of Appeals that then

adopted it.
MR. BEELER:
QUESTION:

Quite frankly —
The Court of Appeals concentrated on

what has been called here "step three."

no
MR. BEELER:

Quite frankly, I think the reason

the Government petitioned for cert is they simply didn’t
like the way the Court of Appeals’ opinion was written.
I am not sure that they would have faulted an
opinion written like the District Court’s opinion because
it made clear findings of fact but Mr. Sanchez was detained
after his driver’s license had been returned and prior to
the interrogation of his passengers.
But this violated his own Fourth Amendment rights
and the District Court opinion talked about detention as
well as a search and it didn't feel that the semantic labels
were important.
What was important was that there was an inter­
ference with an individual’s own constitutional rights.
The Government appears also not to be entirely
satisfied with the District Court's fact-finding but it
hasn’t come out and said that, gee, the District Court was
clearly erroneous and these are the reasons why and here is
the case law showing why.
And as a matter of fact, the record shows that the
District Court agonized over the question of when the
detention occurred and he came to the conclusion and made
fully supportable fact findings that the detention of
Mr. Sanchez occurred after his driver’s license was
returned and that all four, not just three, were arrested

41
and they were brought to the police station.
QUESTION:

The government

Mr. Beeler, does the record show that

Mr. Sanchez objected to that brief period of detention?
MR. BEELER:

There is nothing in the record to

show that he made any protest.

The record, I believe, would

show that he acquiesced.
However, he had submitted to a demand for proof
of identity .from the law enforcement officers who came up
to his car,

one stationing themselves at his window, one

stationing himself at the other window —
Were they in uniform?

QUESTION:
MR. BEELER:
armed.

They were.

They were in uniform.

They were carrying chemical Mace.

They were

It was 2:30 in

the morning, which cuts two ways.
The Government made no showing that it is unusual
for people to be in the suburb of Villa

Park looking at a

map and hunting for a restaurant at that time of night, but
when two police officers come up on either side and they
offer to help you find a restaurant and then after that they
demand some proof of identity and then they carry on this
kind of procedure, I think it is — it is not in the record
other than that Mr. Sanchez is a Mexican-American.
QUESTION:

In your colloquy with Mr. Justice

Stewart, reference was made to the search.
you have in mind?

What search do

42

What do you think constituted a search?
MR. BEELER:

In addition to the detention of

Mr. Sanchez which resulted in the discovery of the witnesses,
the procedure of interrogating the passengers can also be
viewed as the search during the period of this detention.
Their simultaneous search and detention, the
Government conceded in the Court of Appeals, once again,
that this would constitute a search.

I think by any stan­

dards it is a search.
The police officers were asking questions to learn
things that were not in plain

view.

The identity of these

witnesses was in no sense in plain view, any more than the
contents inside a paper bag are in plain view.
QUESTION:

Would it have been different, as has

been suggested, if these four individuals had been walking
down the street and had stopped and appeared to have been
lost and two officers had come up and said, "May we help
you?" and in the course of the conversation the officers
asked questions, for i.d. cards, would that be a different
case?
And if so, where is the search?
MR. BEELER:

Assuming that all of the other facts

would be about the same, then we would assume that
Mr. Sanchez was in custody.

He itfasn't free to leave while

his three companions were being interrogated, that if he

^3
did attempt to leave, then he would have been pursued and
recaptured.
QUESTION:

That is a speculation, isn't it?

MR. BEELER:

Well, that would make your hypothetical

equivalent to the situation that we do have in this case.
The law enforcement officer made it quite clear that he was
going to hold Mr. Sanchez there until this routine was
completed, that he wasn't free 'to drive off.
QUESTION:

I thought he said he wasn't free to

drive off with the passengers.
MR. BEELER:

That is what Mr. Friedman says.

That

is not in the record anywhere.
The record shows that if Mr. Sanchez
to leave

had attempted

and my question contains no reference to the

passengers in the car or out of the ear.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. BEELER:

If Mr. Sanchez had attempted to leave,

they would have chased after him and — now I am quoting,
"Pulled him off again."
I think from this kind of testimony and from the
District Court's finding, upon a very careful analysis, just
what was going through the police officers' minds, he was in
custody.

He couldn't go anywhere.

He was held under Terry

versus Ohio standards.
QUESTION:

It is clear, on the other hand, I suppose»

44
that had there been no passengers and everything else had
transpired as it did, he had been approached and given his
identification, there would have been no question about
his freedom to leave and that is your case.

That is the

point of your case, isn't it?
MR. BEELER:
QUESTION:
MR. BEELER:
QUESTION:
MR. BEELER:
QUESTION.

If there had been no passengers —
Right,
— he could have driven right off.
Right.
Once he proved —
And that is the nub of your argument,

isn't it?
MR. BEELER:
QUESTION:

That is the nub of it.
Do you think it sheds any light on the

situation that the police told the two unidentified
passengers to leave the car and come with them to the police
station — they distinguished between the

two who could

not supply an identification and the two who did have
identification?
MR. BEELER:
distinguished.

Th'cre was no testimony that they

There was ;he fact that Mr. Sanchez was used

to transport —
QUESTION:
MR. BEELER:

Physically.
— one of the passengers physically.

They went in a convoy and so it was obvious that Mr. Sanchez

45
probably couldn't have taken off.
The District Court found that they were arrested.
The Court of Appeals found all four were arrested.
The Government concedes in all of their briefs
and up until right now that they were arrested.

So I don’t

think it makes much difference what cars they were put in or
how the police arranged for their particular custody.
The point was that Mr. Sanchez was driving to a
police station instead of to a restaurant, which was his
choice.
To return, if I could, just briefly, to Mr. Justice
Powell's hypothetical, I think the important factor of the
sidewalk situation would be a question of whether or not
Mr. Sanchez would have to be detained and stay there while
the police conducted their identity search of the people
that he was with and if he was held with them, either by a
command or by some type of physical act of being in a
situation where he couldn’t get out, he was held in like he
would be in a car — let’s say he was in a dead-end alley and
he couldn't get out until the police were done, why, then,
the detention factor is the same.
In terms of a search, well, it — it is not a
search of his car in that case.

There is no car in that

hypothetical but, nonetheless, it is a Fourth Amendment
violation and that is the central violation that we are

-46

focusing in on this case.
We believe that this case stands for the freedom
of people to move on the highways without being subjected to
unconstitutional violations of their freedom of travel.
QUESTION:
wasn't travelling.

I don’t want to be facetious, but he
They were parked.

MR. BEELER:

He was parked for the purpose of a

brief stop in his travel to get his bearings to the restau­
rant he was looking for.
QUESTION:

But his travel wasn’t interrupted by

the police.
MR. BEELER:

Not initially.

But once it was

detained, for practical purpose, that is an interruption.
Instead of ending up at the restaurant or ending up at the
restaurant a little bit late, which I would consider to be
an interruption

of travel, it was almost inevitable —

QUESTION:

Do they have restaurants in these

little towns at 2:30 in the morning?
MR. BEELER:
fcoxm.

Villa Park isn’t such a tiny little

It is 25 to 30,000 people in u suburb west of

Chicago.

One suburb is packed up agiinst another.
I think the record in this rase, taken in a .light

most favorable to the Defendant, which it must

be — we

are here as the Appellee and as the Respondent —
QUESTION:

Mr. Beeler, the cai really wasn’t just

47
on the side of the road.

As I recalls wasn't it 20 — 15

or 20 feet off the road in a sort of vacant area?
MR. BEBLER:

Mr. Justice Powell, it was in a cut­

off between North and Addison Read and I have obtained
Defendant's Exhibit A, which I thought had been transmitted
to the Supreme Court earlier but when I checked with the
Marshal's office* it hadn't come as. d that exhibit, which is
a photograph, I am sure would bs available from the Marshal.
It shows, as our brief asserts, that this was a
perfectly logical, normal place for one to pull off the
road to read a map.

The police officer in the case testified

as to no suspiscion about where the car was parked.
There was no parking citation and I don't think
the location of the car is any part of the case as it reaches
this Court.
QUESTION:

■'

.

Well, but be that as it may, Mr. Beeler,

my understanding is, and has been up until now, that you
don’t object to the policemen approaching the car or interro­
gating the driver or asking him for his identification or
checking his identification.
Am I wrong about that?
MR. BEELER:

You are right.

We felt that there was

no reason to raise that.
QUESTION;

Right.

QUESTION:

Does this record show at what stage the

pistol was discovered in the glove compartment?

That is, it

was obviously after they got to the police station, but at
what point was the search made?
MR. BEELER;

As I understand the record, after the

four arrived at the police station and they were "brought
inside,1' which is to use the words chosen by the police
officer, then while the interrogation was going on in the
police station, there was simultaneously a search being
made of Mr. Sanchez’ automobile.
Evidentally it is the kind of search that would
include a search of the trunk except he, of course, had a
station wagon, search of the glove compartment, search of
any hiding area in the car.
QUESTION:

Now, was that — I don’t recall that

this record shows, except that — what happened to it,
except that there is a reference to the fact that it isn’t
in this case but was there a motion to suppress that
independently in another "proceeding?
MR. BEELER:

There was — it is not in the record

but in direct answer to your question, represented by
different counsel, Mr. Sanchez pleaded guilty to the Illinois
violation of possessing a firearm without having registered
it and he received probation and a fine for that offense.
Also, I would add for the record, and it does
appear

unsworn from counsel in the transcript, the firearm

49
was a gift he had received from an uncle in Texas which he
had just brought into Illinois and there was no opportunity
to register it but I also agree with your suggestion that
that is not part of this case as it arrives here.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Friedman?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL L. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Just a couple of minor points.

First, on our concessioning and all of that, I
think that it — first of all it is not a concession.

It is

an assumption for the purposes of argument and what
happened, as I understand it —
QUESTION:

You mean, in the Court of Appeals.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

In the Court of Appeals which we

don’t feel bound by here is, the District Court reached a
conclusion that the interrogation was a search and so for
purposes of argument, we say, let’s assume that it was a
search and now let’s go on and talk about whether it was
reasonable or rot,
QUESTION:

Let's further assume that the Respondent

has standing —
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Has standing at that point and if

it were a search.
rLie Court of Appeals didn't discuss step two.

They

50
went to step three.

Well, now we are talking about step

three and that assumption has nothing to do with step three
and should this Court want to take a look at step two, we
don’t feel bound by that assumption*

We feel free to

argue that the conduct was reasonable, that there was no
standing, that live witnesses are different from physical
evidence and so on.
QUESTION:

Of course, if we agree with Mr. Beeler,

that is the end of this case.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

That is the end of the case.

But if we agree with you, it has got to

go back, doesn’t it?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

It has got to go back, either with

this Court looking afc some of those other aspects or asking
or telling the Court of Appeals to look at some of those
other aspects.
QUESTION:

To clarify some of them.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

To clarify what went on in that

second stage.
In response to Mr. Justice Marshall’s question a
little while ago about, didn't the officer testify that he
only took him down because the passengers were still with
him?

Well, the question by Mr. Beeler on page 63 of the

Appendix was not what you would have done with the Respondent
at any stage., but he said, "Back at North and Addison, after

51
you and Officer Hall had gone over to the Defendant's ear
and after Officer Hall had asked the Defendant for an i.d.
and after the Defendant had produced his driver's license
and after Officer Hall had returned the driver's license,
what would you and Officer Hall have done if the Defendant
then drove off immediately in his car without asking your
permission?"
So we think that the Officer's answer that he would
have given chase is perfectly consistent with his later
testimony that later on he would have let the Defendant ~~
the Respondent go, once he had had those passengers and once
he was beginning to find out something about the passengers.
The point is, so long as the passengers were with
him and he hadn’t checked them out, he was stopping to get
those passengers.
But the Respondent was not being detained for any
purposes directed at the Respondent.
QUESTION:

Don’t you agree that the Respondent,

from the time that he was first stopped until he got into
the police station, felt that he was sort of —

2:30 in the morning when a policeman, armed, says, "Would
you mind coming along?"
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, it is also 2:30 in the

morning when you are looking for a restaurant and the
police come over and they don't say, "You are coming with
us."

They come over and say, "Can we help you find the

restaurant?

What seems to be the trouble?"

QUESTION:

No, this was after that.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I mean —

Well, I think, frankly, that you

have to look at it step by step —QUESTION:

What would you have done under the

circumstances?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

What I would have done?

Would you have gone along?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Under the circumstances I probably

would have felt that there was no reason not to go along.
QUESTION:

You sure would.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

But that doesn't make it an

That doesn't make it an arrest and I am reminded,

mainly because I have it written in front of me here, of
a concurring opinion by Judge Leventhal at one point where
he said, you know,"Walking up and asking questions"— in a
case called Bailey versus United States

While most people might feel they are not free to go.
■But the difficult question is whether, in the face

of a specific refusal to answer questions or specific
request to go, would there then have become an arrest?1'

request to go and in this case, ought not —

QUESTION:

Well, could you draw any conclusion

from that?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, he is free to take the stand

at the suppression hearing without incriminating himself in
a way that can be used against him later on in the trial.
He is free to tell his side of the story in support
of his motion to suppress and he didn’t do it.
Now, all I am saying is that the evidence before
the Court and the evidence in the transcript here is un­
contradicted and if you will look at it step-by-step, it is
reasonable.
Now, Respondent talks about "dragnet procedures."
This case isn’t about dragnet procedures.
If you will look at what those police did, step-bystep, we submit their conduct was reasonable.

We don't have

to get to that question but we submit that their conduct was
reasonable because it is —
QUESTION:

What case was it in this Court that held

that the stop-and-frisk and the patting down, the searching

could be done without constituting an arrest?

versus —

Well, doesn’t it resolve some of the

questions that are —
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, I think it certainly does

because there was some articulable reason at some point to
ask them some questions and after that there was some
articulable reason to try to find out who they were further,
Just to detain them to — to determine their identity.
That is all that this case is about.
Now, Justice White asked a question a little
while ago about are there any cases where the courts have
said you can ask passengers in a car for identification.
One case that — that I know of is a case called
United States versus Madrille, 4^5 Fed 2nd 827, a Ninth
Circuit case.

And that makes the point it is okay to ask

identity of the people in the car as well.
Let me just make about two other points.
Respondent argues concerning live witnesses and
says that the Smith and Bowdin case written by the Chief
Justice talked about all the intervening things and so on.
We think that the Chief Justice's concurring opinion in
Rosier Brown makes clear that what was being discussed there
was,

you don't suppress live witnesses.
Cross-examination is sufficient to protect people's

57
rights.

It goes to weight, not admissibility whether —

depending upon how they were seized, how they were come at.
We also think that this ease is different from
the case where, if they had gone into a trunk and found
witnesses in a trunk.

These witnesses were not come at by

any search or any illegality.

They were there in plain view

and they were not — they were not the result of any sort of
a search.
And even looking at Respondent’s argument :ln its
most favorable light, he says that if he had been permitted
to drive on after showing his license, the police would have
obtained no evidence against him and that that is what this
case is all about.
If he had been permitted to drive on, we say.
everything else would have been the same as it is here.

The

passengers would have been detained, the evidence flowed
irom them.

It had nothing to do with his detention and we

think if you get to stage two that that may be relevant.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
ihank you, Mr. Beeler.

Thank you, Mr. Friedman.

And, Mr. Beeler, you came

nere at the request of the Court and by the Court’s appoint­
ment to represent Mr. Sanchez.
On behalf of the Court, I

want to thank you for

your assistance to us and, of course, to Mr. Sanches.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:17 a.m., the case was submitted.]
