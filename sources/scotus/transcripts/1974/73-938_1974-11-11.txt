PROCEEDINGS
HR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 73--93S, Cox Broadcasting against Cohn.
Mr. McAlpin, I think you can proceed whenever you6re
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KIRK M. MeALPIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. McALPIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here before you today on an appeal
from the Supreme Court of Georgia..
privacy case.

It's an invasion of

It does not involve libel, it does not involve

any false statements, it does not involve any defamation.
It's clearly a truthful, nondefamatory statement of the
reporting of a public trial in the State of Georgia.
It is a decision from the Supreme Court of Georgia
to

which we complain, a 4-tO”3 decision.

The majority

decision of the Supreme Court of Georgia held that the
First Amendment rights providing constitutional guarantee of
freedom of the press did not operate in favor of the
defendant in this case.
I think the factual circumstances of the reporting
of the trial may be very significant.

I would like to calce

just a minute to deal with that.
QUESTION:

You're going to deal with jurisdiction

A

in due course, I take it?
MR. Me ALP 111:

Yes, sir, I am, Your Honor.

On February 19th, you reserved the right on juris­
diction to a hearing on the merits of today.

We are here, as

you know, on an appeal and not a certiorari.

We've asked

alternatively for certiorari.

We are here under 1257.

I think the -- without belaboring that issue, I do want to
treat it briefly — we have covered it in our brief.

We feel

that the recent Tornillo case, the Snyder case — that is the
North Dakota Pharmacy case — meets the finality issue.
Suffice it to say, that the Supreme Court of
Georgia, when they upheld the constitutionality of the statute
which provided that we could not publish the name or identity
of a rape victim or one who was assaulted, they effectively
destroyed our First Amendment rights in the trial court.
There is a remand, but that remand by the Supreme Court of
Georgia deals x^ith the right of the plaintiff and not the
constitutional right of the defendant.
The remand that went to the trial court was to this
effect:

that the holding was, which the Court is well aware,

that the publication of the identity of the name of a murderrape victim -- and that is important in this case? it was not
solely a rape victim, but a murder-rape victim — was not a
matter of public interest or general concern in the State of
Georgia.

5
Now, that precluded effectively, we say, and made
this case ripe for review in this Court, as in Snyder and as
in Tornillo, that it made, it precluded the defendant, our
client, from asserting any rights in the lower court regarding
the constitutional First Amendment considerations.
We think that, like Tornillo, that it would be a
delay, it would be a costly trial, these considerations, we
think there’s an urgency because of the freedom of the press.
We think that here is a statute, it's a restraint, a restraint
on the freedom of the press.

The presumption that this Court

has dealt with is when a restraint imposes itself by State
statute or otherwise on First Amendment rights, it comes here
with a presumption of invalidity.
Here we had the reporting of a public trial, we
have freedom of the press, the editors in — not only the
editors of news media in Georgia, but everywhere, where we
have multistate reporting, have no conception as to what the
rule would be.
Now, you remember, there are only four States that
have similar statutes:

Florida, South Carolina, Georgia and

Wisconsin.
Yet, anybody that publishes a story that may go into
another State — for example, Saturday there was such a report
in your Washington paper Saturday morning; yet if that story
should go into Georgia, the press has an exposure under Georgia

6

lav/.

Likewise, if that story emanated in Georgia and came

up on the national news service, Georgia would have an action
for the publication, possibly, both ways.
So we are dealing — and I say the urgency is, we
are dealing with a freedom of the press.

No one knows what

the rule particular is, and I'd like to try to deal with that
a little bit today.

We say the urgency is that freedom of

the press, if you send this back to the trial court it may
take two or three years, if this is an unconstitutional
statute, as we submit,, and with the presumption of invalidity
as it comes to this Court, -—
QUESTION; Where do you — what cases of ours do
you get the presumption of invalidity from?
MR, MeALPIN;

The Keefe case,

QUESTION: Well, that was a prior injunctive
restraint, wasn't it?
MR, McALPINs That was a preliminary injunction, and
blockbusters, they were passing leaflets and blockbusting.
QUESTION:
this statement.
held

Yes, well, nobody enjoined you from making

It's just a question of whether you will be

liable on damages for violation of the respondent's

privacy, isn't it?
MR. McALPIN:

But, Your Honor, nobody else can make

it, and if we don't resolve this case, and if we are entitled
— and I want to deal with the facts and circumstances of this

7
case — if we misjudge? we, for the next several years maybe?
cannot report anything further»

And if there is a constitu­

tional right to publish, as we state? that this is a matter
of public interest? then it does not seem that that should be
delayed? that we should have that right immediately.
QUESTIONS Well? then? in your view, all First
Amendment cases involve prior restraint?
MR» McALPIN:

Not necessarily.

QUESTION; Well? what wouldn't, under that analysis
of yours?
You're always going to have some sanctions that
occur before or after.
MR. McALPIN;

Well? you've held that a judgment is

a State restraint? you've held that an injunction is a State
restraint, a statute is a State restraint.

It may be that

these cases? that there is that restraint there.

In this

case -—
QUESTION:

But on prior restraints? though; that's

the issue, that we're focusing on now.
MR. McALPIN; Well? I think that’s -- I think this
case is a prior restraint.

I think this case? by virtue of

its statute? it is a prior restraint.

I think that may

separate an immediate injunction from a standing statute?
such -- or regulation; you have dealt with standing statutes
or regulations as prior restraints on the freeom of the press.

8
I think that also the urgency here is this decision,,
this decision shows that the Legislature of Georgia now is
empowered at any time —
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. McAlpin, as I read the opinion

of the Supreme Court of Georgia —* and I'm looking at this
Jurisdictional Statement, pages A-12 and A-13 ~ they disclaimed
any relevance of the statute to the existence of the civil
action for damages for invasion of privacy.
QUESTION:

Look at page A-24, to read their opinion

on Motion for Rehearing.
MR. McALPIN:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: Where they do rely on the statute.
MR. McALPIN:

In the second case, Your Honor, it

is —
QUESTION:

No, they may rely on it, but do they

say that independent — do they say that only the existence
of the statute -—
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. McALPIN:

They say because — oh, excuse me,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

— creates the cause of action?

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. McALPIN:

In the second — on the Motion for

Rehearing —
QUESTION:

The Georgia lav; penalty is that the

9

truthful report of a matter of general interest is -- it
cannot make anybody liable in Georgia.

That’s well settled.

But they say that because of the statute, the Georgia Legis­
lature has held that this is not a matter of general interest,
MR. MeALPIN:

That's correct, Your Honor. That was

on the Motion for Rehearing.
QUESTION:

That the statute is essential to find

liability in this lawsuit.

And that’s what the opinion on the

Motion for Rehearing makes clear, beginning on page A-24.
MR. McALPIN:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

I would suppose your answer to Justice

Rehnquist would be that Mills v. .Alabama is your case that
would indicate there might be jurisdiction here, rather than
Citizens for Better Austin v. Keefe, which is an injunction
case.
MR. McALPIN:
QUESTION:
MR. McALPIN:

Yes, sir.
Mills v. A1abama was not.
Mi11s vs. A1abama, the only reason

I didn't — we rely in our brief on Mills vs„ Alabama, also
North Dakota Pharmacy v, Snyder, and Tornillo.

Mills vs.

Alabama, of course, the distinction that we --- we submit that
that is the lav/, and that supports us.
But in that case it was just about stipulated that
there were no defenses that the party would have, if the case
went back for trial.

As in Tornillo, where there were

10

defenses on the remand, likewise there will be defenses that
we would have» And that's why I didn't use, in argument, 'the
Mills vs. Alabama ease.
But the defenses would not, the defenses would not
involve the First Amendment.

We would try to deal —- it's like

libel; we would :ry to show that the plaintiff had not had
his privacy invaded, and that it was not offensive.

But we

think that that question, that that should not be submitted
at a trial court, and that's why you should take possibly
appeal here.
QUESTION; Well, my question to you was not addressed
to the jurisdictional issue, contrary to Justice Stewart's
suggestion, -MR. McALPIN:
QUESTION:
I had anticipated.

Oh, I see.

— I think you responded along the lines
But you style this as a prior restraint, and

I had thought that the distinction in our cases was that a
prior restraint was something that you're prohibited from
doing in advance of trying to do it.

Here there was no

prohibition — there was no injunction that you would be in
contempt of if you went ahead and published this thing.

You're

simply being subjected to damages afterwards, like in a libel
case.
MR. McALPIN:
under Georgia law

It's a misdemeanor action, Your Honor,

11
QUESTION:

Nobody is prosecuting you, are they?

MR. McALPIN:

Well, on the other hand, there was a

prosecution in Evjue, in the Wisconsin case, the South
Carolina Happier case that they rely upon, ~
QUESTION: But nobody is prosecuting you under
Georgia law, are they?
QUESTION: Even if they were, that wouldn't be a
prior restraint.

Mr. Justice Rehnquist is so correct:

prior

restraint has a rather technical meaning, and that's not
involved here.

Post, after the fact, criminal or civil

liability has nothing to do with a prior restraint.
MR. McALPIN: Well, Your Honor, we don't buttress
our entire argument on that point.
Court’s consideration.

I will recognize the

It does seem, though, that the — and

we submit so in our brief —- that the threat of criminal
prosecution at any time would be —- well, it certainly has a
chilling effect, and it certainly creates a self-censorship
on us, that this Court has condoned in Doirtbrowski and in New
York Times vs. Sullivan; and if that is — and certainly the
Court has stated that, and we recognize that in this area;
that where there is such a chilling effect and where there
is self-censorship that we are imposing on ourselves on a
First Amendment .right, which we say is a constitutional
guarantee to us, that to prove — to print newsworthy items
in matters of public and common interest; on the jurisdictional

12

question. I would submit that there is an urgency to resolve
this, that there is an urgency to set a rule so that the
press will not be in doubt, and if the First Amendment, which
we submit ~™ and I would like to deal with very briefly —
does give us this right to publish matters of common interest,
then the Supreme Court of Georgia and the Statute of Georgia
should not deprive us of it.
QUESTION:

Well, doesn’t the Code of Ethics or

Canons of Journalism already impose restraints upon you?
Directed now to your present argument, that this has some
chilling effect; aren't there Canons of Journalism that -MR. McALPIN:

Yes, sir, the State of Georgia deals

with —
QUESTION:

----- impose some kind of restraint on you?

MR, McALPIN:

The State of Georgia has mentioned

that
QUESTION: Well, is that correct or not?

Are they

right about it?
MR. McALPIN:

Well, I think that there probably is

Canones of Ethics to that effect, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. McALPIN:

But, on the other hand, if the First

Amendment -QUESTION:

Well, there would be that much chilling

effect, would there not?

13
MR. McALPIN:

I don't think, in this particular

case, Your Honor, that there would be even any violation of
those ethical principles, because in this case the circumstances of the trial itself, I do not believe, would in any
way come within the Canons of Ethics of the editors, which
you have referred to,
For this reason, and maybe, if the Court will permit
me to do so, I should probably reach that point:

In this

case, as in Craig vs. Harney, this was a public trial, this
was the trial of six boys who went on trial for the murderrape of Cynthia Cohn.

Remember, at eight months -- eight

months before this trial, the girl's name had never been
released.
At the trial — and the circumstances of this trial
are rather unusual, and the result of the circumstances of it
-- at this trial, these six boys decided to plead guilty.
One of them, after sentencing, one of them withdrew his plea
of guilty.

But it was by reason of the father, the father of

Cynthia Cohn, whose name has not been disclosed

in this

report, who asked the prosecutor to give leniency and to —
recommended a five-year term for these boys.
Now, remember, he was not there.

He was — I don't

know even if he was a material witness or not. The prosecutor
-n this case asked the judge to accept the parent's recommenda­
tion and withdraw the murder charges, and to give the boys

14
five years, on a five-year term.
They were sentenced.

One of them withdrew his plea,

and he was to be tried before a jury.

At that time — and

this is very significant, as you have said in the Butts case,
where Justice Harlan said that if the person was in the
courtroom and actually was present there and saw this, as in
the Harney case — the reporter Wassell was in the courtroom.
The name of Cynthia Cohn was on the indictment.
public record.
by the Clerk.

It was a

It was handed to the reporter in the courtroom
He asked to look at the indictment.

And at that time it was murder-rape on Cynthia Cohn.
He went right outside the courtroom, right after this had
occurred, after the case was over with, and televised a report
on the courthouse steps, very timely, not like Briscoe that
the Supreme Court of Georgia uses eleven years later, which we
submit the question of remoteness is not very material in
these cases.
But he went right out there and he told what happened.
It was factual.

It was true.

Nobody disputes that. That’s

not in issue.
At that time he released the name of the girl,
Cynthia Cohn.

He merely says, at this time, that the boys were

brought before the Court, they were tried, and it was of
great interest to the people of Sandy Springs, and he publishes
the name.

15

Now, this, we submit, on First Amendment rights,
that this was a public reporting of a public trial in which
the girl's name \^as a newsworthy item.

It was a routine item*

And we submit that this case may have — you may can fashion
several rules out of this case.

But, knowing of the dilemma

in the privacy field, I would like to maybe try to treat some
of the areas that this case may fit.
QUESTION:

Mr. McAlpin, if I may, for a moment:

Suppose it had been a trial closed to the public, would
your argument be any different?
MR. McALPIN:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, I think —
I was wondering why you were

emphasizing the fact that it was a public trial.
MR. McALPIN:

It was a public trial.

There was no

restraints made by the Judge, the name of —
QUESTION: Are you relying on that, or would it be
the same if it were private — I mean, the public was
excluded?
MR. McALPIN: Well, the plaintiff makes reference to
the juvenile cases, where — and we commented in the court,
we comment in our brief that those statutes, and I'm not
certainly, really, that that would be a distinction, Your
Honor.

I'd like to x*each that, because while we —
QUESTION:
MR. MCALPIN;

Go ahead.
While we say that those cases, the

16
juvenile and the closed casas are distinguishable, when you
are publishing truth or nondefamatory matter, we are not really
certain — we don't think we have to reach that in this case.
But, nevertheless, we have dealt with it. We are thinking
about it.
And when you are dealing with truthful, nondefamatory
reporting, guaranteed by the Constitution, on a question as —•
and on a question dealing with, we may say, judicially created
rights of privacy, then you may not — it may be that closed
sessions or juvenile reporting, even where it says it's not
available, would not be privileged.
QUESTION:

And I think there may be -

Well, it could also be that you might not

have the name, either, of the victim, if they were closed to
you.

Here the name was readily available to the entire public,

including your client.
MR. MeALPIN: That's correct, Your Honor.
And to answer that —■ yes, sir?
QUESTION:

Mr. McAlpin, do you go so far as to say

that the First Amendment right is an absolute one, to publish
this girl' s name, no matter where, from w?hat source you obtain
it?
MR. McALPIN:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, —
If it's true that she is the one that

was the victim.
MR. McALPIN:

*— under the decisions of this Court,

17
it has been held that there are limitations on exercise of
First amendment rights.

I would -- I don't think in this case

we have to go beyond that, sir.
QUESTION;

Well, I know we don’t, but I’m asking

whether you want us to go beyond — you said earlier that
you thought this was something —
MR. MeALPIN; We are not asking for that, but I do
think, in treatment of the First Amendment question in privacy
areas, I am prepared to deal with that a little bit, but I do
not think it’s necessary in this case to go beyond that.
But —
QUESTION;

You want us, then, to limit this to a

First Amendment right truthfully to report a judicial
proceeding?
MR. McALPIN:
QUESTION;

No, sir, I do not.

You want us to go beyond that?

MR. McALPIN: That's why I say I think that these
rules —
QUESTION; Well, how far beyond that do you want us
to go?
MR. McALPIN:

All right.

Well, Your Honor, it may

be that truthful reporting of nondefamatory matter has
absolute privilege.
QUESTION: Well, do you want us to go that far?
MR. McALPIN; Well, yes, sir.

18

QUESTION:

I thought you wanted us to deal with

the constitutional validity of this Georgia statute on its
face.
MR. McALPIN: We do, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, that's —

MR. McALPIN:
QUESTION:

And I'd like to deal with that.

— that's all we need do, isn't it?

MR. McALPIN: All right, sir.

But I was asked the

question, and dealing with this question I -- it does become
somewhat concerned — it does concern us somewhat that there
may be, in truthful, nondefamatory publications, it may be
that the right of — the so-called right of invasion of
privacy may not enjoy the same position as it does in intrusion
cases, appropriation cases, false-light cases.

Those are

three areas of invasion of privacy that don't apply here,
Arid this is not that type of case.

Here we have —

and the reason I say this, Your Honor, we are somewhat concerned
by virtue of the fact that truth and defamation traditionally,
historically, is an absolute defense, with no reference to
remoteness of time.
In the Spahn case, in which you sent the Time vs.
Hill case -— brought the Time vs. Hill case back here for re­
argument, in view of Spahn in New York, where the Circuit
Court -there said that they will not — in the instances of
truth, in New York, that no one can violate that New York

19

statute, as I recall.
Now, truth there, it didn51 say, is it truthful
today, yesterday, eleven years ago, like in Briscoe? and the
question there in every instance — and when you’re dealing
with t3:uth in publications, on falsity, defamation, and
where truth is a defense, it’s an absolute defense.
Yet when you turn around and come into privacy
areas, when you have an absolute right to publish — as I
say, Your Honor, Justice Brennan, I don’t mean absolute -I'm recognizing the decisions of this Court, as absolute
subject to the restrictions on the intimate and the revelations
and things of this nature, but
QUESTION:

Well, I think, in this area, this is

probably the first case, that I recall, since I’ve been here.
MR. MeALPIN:
QUESTION:

It is.
Where we have dealt with a concededly

truthful report.
MR. McALPIN: This is correct.
QUESTION: And the question of the extent to which,
at least as the press is concerned —
MR. McALPIN:
QUESTION:

That’s right.

— the First Amendment protection to

publish that, no matter where it comes from.
MR. McALPIN:
QUESTION:

That's right.
That's not something we've dealt with.

20
MR. McALPIN;

That’s right.

And we8vs tried to label with a question of invasion
of privacy, in a truthful area, as against the right of
freedom of press, recognizing that this should be given every
possible — by this Court, as it has been — every possible
right with no restraint, or no impairment at all.
But in this area where there is no falsity, there
is no fictionalization, there is no distortions, there’s no
intrusion, there's no appropriation, there's no false light,
in this area, then you put the Constitution, First Amendment
language right by a question of this nature, and you look back
to 1890 when the question was raised on invasion of privacy by
Justices Brandeis and Warren in the history.

And I recognize

that this Court has, in a sense has said that the invasion
of privacy enjoys a constitutional protection.
But, as Justice Black said in his concurring opinion
in Time vs. Hill, he refers to it as a judicially created
right, and he said;

If the courts continue to try to balance

and weigh and take each situation, you are going to dilute
more and more the right of the press.
Now, we are not here — we are here in this case
because we’re being sued for a million dollars? but it's a
bigger question than that.

It’s a question;

What does the

press know to publish where there’s truth, and how do you
determine that?

21
I want to deal quickly with that» But here may be
the rules that you could possibly fashion.
Your precedents seem to give,, in this — while this
is the only case dealing particularly with this issue —
there may be precedents which give these four type of rules
that you might can employ.
And the first one is that a matter of public interest,.
as you held in Hill, that the name is a matter of public
interest.

Now, I'm leaving for the minute the record of the

trial in the Harney case, but coming to the bigger questions
If it's a matter of public interest, or rationally related,
?

?

as you said in Pate and Poise, and we say that the trial -it's admitted in this case that it's a clear question that
the trial itself was a matter of public interest, that the
name was routinely used as a matter of public interest, and
therefore that general proposition would be sufficient.
But then you have Tornillo, and I —
QUESTION;

Excuse me, may I interrupt you for a

minute?
MR. McALPIN;

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: Who decides what is a matter of public
interest?
MR. McALPIN:

Yes, sir, that’s the next thing I was

coming to, Justice P0v7e.ll, in Gertz

— and I'd like to

address that in the few minutes I have, because I think that’s

22

critical.
I know in Gerfcz, in this Court says that we, this
Court does not want to deal with matters of public interest,
to make that determination.

Yet in —■ yet you did decide

til at Gertz was a private individual, you made an issue or
determination that Gertz was not a public official or a public
figure, and he was a private individual.
We would submit that under To mil la and possibly
under the rule that you have established when you let AP out,
and the Butts case.

You may have a rule that would say that

this Court, chat it's an editor's judgment, unless there's
clear and extreme abuse, and I think tin at the question of
public interest is the editor's decision, because what you
determined in Tornillo is, you said that if there's no
imagination, how can we find that government interference with
what the editor puts in the paper, in his exercise of
editorial judgment, how can that net take away freedom of
the press?
Now, in Tornillo, you left the judgment

oh,

excuse me.
QUESTION:

About that question, if it’s the editor's

decision, the judiciary would have no further function in this
area.
MR. McALPIN:

Your Honor, it may be,

Tornillo, that it was his judgment.

You left it in

But 1 can see very well

23

•that there could be extreme abuses , and we might suggest to
the. Court that what Justice Harlan said in the Butts case. —
and I just very briefly -- on a showing of highly un­
reasonable conduct, constitute an extreme departure from
standards of investigation reporting ordinarily adhered to
by reasonable publishers, that only in those instances —
and I think this Court, this Court should make the initial
determination whan an abuse question comes.
You have done it in Miller vs. California.

You said

that there is no difficulty for us to determine what’s
commerce in ideas as against commercial exploitation.
The question is whether you submit it to the jury.

And in

the Roy case, I think that was the Monitor Patriot case, you
said the question of relevance should not be submitted to
the jury on standards of Mew York Times, and this Court has
recognized the uncertainties that juries can piety throughout
your cases, and the Gertz case, Justice Powell, you indicated
concern about what juries would do.
So we submit that if you take Tornillo and you use
the rule which was referred to in Gertz, of the — where
there is extreme — where there, if there’s danger of
substantial reputation — to the reputation of the parent,
and when you leave the editorial judgment to — you have
these two considerationss either publish, the publication of
the truth, nondefamatory like this, carries with it, if we

24
may say so, absolute privilege? absolute privilege.
?
And Chappse says , invasion of privacy cases — and
it's mentioned in one,. I think in the Gerts case, or the Hill
case, that in invasion of privacy cases, possibly the
individual xdiere, in this case where there’s truth, that he
will have to stand his reputation before the public.
Now, I say there may be a cutting out of spheres of
intrusion, but those are not — those are intentional

torts,

they are -- appropration, entry, intrusion, and false-light
cases.

Here there may be that rule.

Or there may be the

rule —■ and we suggest it to -the Court — that Tor nil lo,
with the rule, if you want to have a pervasion for review of
Justice Harlan's rule, and it’s your rule -- in the Butts case,
it’s only in those extreme cases where they do not — where
they depart, the ruling was a severe departure.

He said,

when they meant to fine anybody, AP, they let AP out —
they were present, they were in the courtoom that day, they
examined everything, like here, and they made their decision,
unlike Curtis Publishing, where there was a feature story and
they had two or three-months’ leadtime.

And they said there

was no finding of a severe departure from accepted publishing
practices.
So we would submit that it is the editor’s in the
case -- in this case; and in that way you would serve to give
the press a clear,understandable and predictable rule that

25
they could live with.
Right now, the press in America, in privacy cases, they
won't know whether or not you are going to consider it
newsworthy today or whether you’re going to consider it
newsworthy if it was published eleven years ago or ten years
ago.
The expense of coining to a court every time is
unmanageable by the news madia. And therefore, if you can
fashion a rule, in truthful cases, either one, that in a
case like this it has absolute privilege, but in this case -I'm talking now about the record, we say we have already got
— that we have shown that; but in this case to apply to
all such privacy cases, that the editor’s judgment should be
paramount in the consideration.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. McAlpin.

Mr. Land,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN A. LAND, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. LAND;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I would like at the outset to restate, in different
words, what I think the issue in this care is.
And that is:

Is the public identification of ’the

identity of the victim of a rape a matter of public concern,

26
and thereby constitutionally protected, or is it not?
And if it's not, can the State legislatively or
judicially insixre the privacy of a raped female and her family
through either penal or civil sanctions?
I would also like to say at the outset that there
is a distinction in ‘this case that I believe the Supreme Court
of Georgia drew.
I do not believe that the Supreme Court of Georgia
made an initial threshold decision, it did make that threshold
decision that the specific identity of the victim of a rape
was not a matter of general public concern or newsworthy
in the constitutional sense, and only after it made that
initial decision did it hold that the statute involved hare
was constitutional and not in violation of the First Amendment.
But it’s the initial decision that was essential
before we reached the second.
1 would also like to state that there is no injunctive
relief involved in this case.

I think that the issue raised

by one of the Court members' questions is an important one as
to the difference between prior' restraint and no prior
restraint.
And that will be found in a constitutional provision
of the State of Georgia, which holds that there is absolute
freedom of 'die press — I don't have the precise language, but
there is absolute freedom of the press that shall not. foe

27
infringed, but those who exercise that freedom are responsible
for the consequences in certain circumstances.
Now, I think some reference to the facts is also
necessary.
It was on August 18, 1971, that the appellee's
seventeen-year-old daughter was raped, and she died shortly
after that rape.
Six young men, sometime later, some six months later,
were indicted for murder and rape.

The murder cases were

dismissed by nolle pros, or nolle prosequi.
The rape and the death was widely publicized, but
no mention of the specific identity of the victim was made
until the day of the disposition of five of the six cases
in Fulton Superior Court in Atlanta.
The trial court, upon dealing with this case, got
it on summary judgments, the Civil Practice Act of Georgia
is quite similar to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
The trial court granted a summary judgment for the plaintiff
on liability, and denied defendant's motion for summary
judgment.
It is essential to realise when the Supreme Court
of Georgia reversed that decision, it reversed the summary
judgment for plaintiff for very important reasons.

I argued

on behalf of appellee,at that time the plaintiff, that the
statute created a civil cause of action in negligence, per se.

28
The Supreme Court of Georgia did not concur with that.
And now, looking back at it, I’m glad they did not concur,
because I believe that a statute that did create civil cause
of action in negligence per se in this case could not be
sustained, in the light of the previous decisions of this
Court»
However, they were vary careful to say that that
statute did not create a civil cause of action on negligence
per se.

They stated only that the first --- that the statute,

criminal statute here, set the State policy or public policy
of the State of Georgia, and they made that initial -threshold
determination that the specific identity of the victim of a
rape is not a matter of public concern, that it did not rise
to the level of First Amendment interests, that what we were
dealing with here is a civil action for invasion of privacy.
If we go back to try this case, the issue, is s Was appelleeSs
privacy invaded?
Not a constitutional question at all.
QUESTION: And the defendant is stripped of any
defense, that this was a matter of public interest?
MR. LAND: The defense -- I would not agree with -that,
Mr. Justice Brennan? I think he does have that defense, because
the Court is not preventing ‘the appellants from defending
themselves against that challenge.

They can always state that

in this case their violation of the privacy was not an invasion

29
of privacy as that tort has been defined? that it was
reasonable and justified under toe circumstances of this case.
QUESTION;

You mean if possibly the victim was

toe daughter of the Governor of the State, that that might
be one of the kinds of cases where protection would not
extend?
MR. LAND:

I would not like to say that, Mr.

Justice Burger.
QUESTION; Well, would you give us some kind of an
idea of what might be one of the exceptions?
MR. LAND:

I wouldthink that that, the point you

just raised, if it was the Governor of Georgia or the
President's daughter, or whatever, gets into toe area of
public and private figures, which I do not believe has a
relevance to these cases.
I do like some of the language in the cases, in
particular Justice Douglas5 language in, I believe, the
Rosenblatt case, which said that we ought not to be troubling
so much with public and private persons, it's toe matter
itself, the news that's the problem? is it or isn't it a
matter of public concern?
If you say it's not, then whoever is involved would
have nothing to do with it.
QUESTION; Well, Mr. Land, would the appellant be
able to defend on the ground that the mere fact that they were

30

reporting a court proceeding, involving pleas to an indictment,
which named this young lady, was itself evidence that this was
a matter of public interest?
MR. LAND;
QUESTION;
MR. LAND;

I think not, Your Honor, for the --They could not do that?
I would think not, because if you were

to say so, and grant that argument, then every case of any
description, brought by any party, would foe a matter —
QUESTION: Well, I don't quite understand what's
open to them, in your submission.

What is open to them by

way of defense?
MR. LAND;

Well, No. 1 is negligence. Were they

negligent, or were they not negligent?
Was the specific publication offensive, in the sense
of the invasion of privacy ...in the elements of that offense?
Would it outrage the sensibilities of a reasonable man?
In some cases I can conceive of, it might not, and
this might be one of them.

They might hold that, well, since

she was dead six, eight months before, since they didn't do
it in a sensationalised — if that's what they want to do -sensationalised manner, since they didn’t do a lot of things
that I can conceive of, then they did not violate the right
to privacy in that this does not rise to that level that
shocks the conscience of individuals, or is offensive.
In fact, the Court might make that determination

31

before it ever got to a jury.
QUESTION: But there would be no defense rooted in
th€2 Constitution?
MR. LAND;

Not in the Constitutional sense itself.

QUESTION; And that issue, that issue, you think, has
been finally disposed of in the Georgia courts?
MR. LAND;

I would have to say, to be candid with

you, Your Honor, yes, I think it has been.

I think they have

made a threshold decision themselves.
I think it’s the same decision that this Court has
made over and over again.

Because -- if I'm not correct, I'm

sure a member of the Court will correct me; but I do not
recall a case, not Time vs. Hill, New York Times vs. Sullivan,
and all the rest in which there was not a presumption, that
the matter that was being discussed was one of public or
general concern.
That threshold assumption had to have been made by
someone, and I presume this Court made it.
QUESTION;
MR. LAND;

Do we have jurisdiction here or not?
Well, in a sense.

QUESTION: Well, do we or don't we?
MR. LAND:
QUESTION:

I think not —
Is this a final — is this a final

j udgment?
MR. LAND:

It is far from a final judgment, in the

32
sense that it’s only on summary judgment that was an
interlocutory step, just like under the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure, a great deal needs to be litigated in this
case.

The factual situation —
QUESTION;

But the Constitution ~ you've just said

the constitutional issue is fully decided and finally disposed
of in this case.
MR. LAND:

In so far as in Georgia.

As far as

Georgia is concerned, it has made the initial threshold
decision, and it's this —
QUESTION:

No, but it's final --

MR. LAND:

Yes —

QUESTION:

— in this case.

There are no — the

lower courts can't redecide the constitutionality.
MR. LAND:

I see no way Fulton Superior Court can

turn around and say that the identity of a rape victim is a
matter of general public concern.
QUESTION:

Well, how about this, Mr. Land, is there

before us, as a constitutional question — as a constitutional
question ~ whether, on the facts of this case, namely, the
report of a judicial proceeding, there is constitutional
protection for the report?
MR. LAND:

That issue is before us, isn't it?

That issue was before the Supreme Court

of Georgia -—
QUESTION s

I know.

Is it before us?

33

MR. LAND:

As a general proposition or as a

constitutional decision or a statutory —■
QUESTION: As a constitutional — as a constitutional
matter.
Suppose we disagree with the Supreme Court of
Georgia,, and were to say that, no, this is the report of a
judicial proceeding, namely, the plea proceedings and the
rest of it, out of which came the report that the indictment
named Cynthia Cohn? and we were to say that this kind of
publication has First Amendment protection?

That issue is

before us, isn51 it?
MR. LAND:

It is and it isn't, x*hich is, of course,

a weasel sort of answer.
QUESTION:
MR. LAND:

Well, xtfhy isn't it?

I -----

Because initially the judicial — the

question of a judicial trial begs the question of the
essentials of this case.
It's either a judicial trial, it could be anything
else.
QUESTION:

Is it conceivable there might be a

distinction between the report of a judicial trial, xtfhich
disclosed the name of the victim, and a report from some other
source?
MR. LAND:

Between, for example, I can think of a

police report, or a report by word of mouth, or some other

34
manner -QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. LAND;

— rather than a judicial trial.

QUESTION s

Yes.

MR. LAND:

No, I don’t think the distinction is valid.

I really don’t.

I think that either one of them, the girl is

entitled to the protection —
QUESTION: So tliat if there is any First Amendment
protection for this report at all, it would extend to a report
— as long as it’s truthful — without regard to the source?
MR. LAND:

I'm not sure I follow the question.

QUESTION;

Witbut regard to where Cox learned the

name, whether it learned it from a police report, a judicial
proceeding, word of mouth, wherever it got it, -—
MR. LAND;
QUESTION;

Yes —
—■ you would say if there's any First

Amendment protection it has to cover idle whole spectrum
and can’t be limited to the report of a judicial proceeding?
MR. LAND:

I would agree with that, yes.

QUESTION:

I thought you said a moment ago just the

opposite, that depending on -the circumstances of the source of
the report, whether word of mouth or police report, that the
constitutional result might be different.
MR. LAND:

No, I think I said that the result, might

be different before a jury in the trial court, in art invasion

35

of privacy tort suit.

That’s where there may be a distinction.

Because the evidence there may be so weak as to not justify
them in finding an outrage or incentive — offensive to
reas©noble-man standard.
And whereas the constitutional issue would not be
involved at all.

And I cannot see that, ipso facto, because

it’s a matter of public, you know, public record in a trial
in the State court it automatically becomes a matter of public
and general interest.
Because if that's true, everything that happens
in the courthouse becomes public domain, and the press can
print it, regardless of any feelings of privacy for anyone
under any circumstances.
QUESTIONS Well, historically, though, the press
has enjoyed a qualified privilege with respect to judicial
proceedings that it hasn't in other contexts.
MR. LANDs

I'm not

QUESTIONS

Just as a matter of State libel law.

MR. LAND; Well, the State of Georgia has act^d on
that regard.

There is a statute that protects the press

from what's called newspaper libel, there's an exception for
it. But that exception did not, according to the Supreme Court
of Georgia, apply to this case.
QUESTIONS
in libel lav; —

But it is ~ it has been characteristic

36

MR. LAND;

Yes , sir.

QUESTION:

— to distinguish between the reports of

judicial proceedings and other kinds of reports.
MR. LAND:

I would agree.

But the —

QUESTION:

I assume that in Georgia there is no

question of right of privacy action surviving death?
MR. LAND:

No, sir.

That issue did not come up

precisely that way in this case, and counsel for appellants,
who are quite able, raised that.
The question was, Was there a so-called relational
right of privacy?
QUESTION: But that would really be a State law
question, anyhow, wouldn't it?
MR. LAND:

Yes, sir, and it was determined that the

father did have a cause of action of his own.

There was no

survival.
And I would like also to emphasise to the utmost that
I'm able that the press is laboring under an extremely minimal
restriction here.

They are free to report everything about

the crime, every tiling about the incident, everything about the
event itself.

The only restriction on them is the specific

identification of the victim of a rape.
And this, in my opinion, distinguishes this case from
the others, especially Time v. Kill.

You had no State interest,

per se, in that case in protecting anonymity.

You have here

37

the: strongest possible state interest in protecting
anonymity over and above the individual's interest in privacy,
which we all have, to a greater or limited extent.
But here you’ve got both.

You’ve got the State's

interest in the prosecutorial function, the difficulty in
prosecuting rapes, the well-known reluctance of rape victims
to go ahead with a prosecution because of the absolute horror
that it involves for them.

And, speaking of privacy, she

already has her privacy invaded in the most brutal form that
we know of.
And then over and on top of that, if you tell the
families of victims in rapes — the families and.the rape
victims themselves in Georgia that you’re not going to get any
relief from publicity in the press and the news media, you
have one more area —
QUESTION: But this statute would apply even if the
victim and the family had no objection.
MR, LAND;
Marshall.

I would not concur with that, Justice

I think
QUESTIONS

Well, what in the statute would you

point to on that?
MR, LAND?

Well, the statute, as drawn, is a criminal

misdemeanor statute,
QUESTION: And it says?
MR, LAND: We are not dealing with a criminal case.

38

If a prosecution were initiated, if the person wished to
waive — and a victim could, in all privacy cases an essential
element is that there has been no waiver implied or expressed
of the right to privacy -- but if the victim wanted, for some
reason, the publicity, I cannot conceive of her being unable
tO do SOo

QUESTION; But the statute is broad enough to cover
it?
MR, LAND;

Well, if a prosecution were initiated,

QUESTION:

Well, the statute does not make any

I would —

exception, does it?
MR. LAND:

It does not.

QUESTION: Well, that's the question.
MR. LAND: The only exceptions will come in the trial
of the case itself, to see whether there is in fact a civil
cause of action, and comes up to the test.
QUESTION: Would your argument be any different, Mr.
Land, if the victim were a common prostitute?
MR. LAND:

No, sir.

QUESTION:

I suppose one of the reasons the other

side would advance here is that the absence of such a
statute tends to bring out witnesses as to character of the
prosecuting witness?
MR. LAND:

I don't accept that, although I think

39

that's a value judgment that's being made by each side»
I've had considerable background as a prosecutor, and rape
cases were among them, and in rape cases there was no
difficulty in getting witnesses; it was the difficulty in
getting the victim as a witness, to report it and to testify»
That was the difficulty.
But it's up to the prosecution to find those
witnesses, not the press, would be my response to that.
QUESTION; Do you find any parallel in the comparative
secrecy of juvenile proceedings?
MR. LAND:

I do.

And it is not quite so.

The

juvenile proceedings are not closed to the press, to my
knowledge.

They are not closed to anyone. I've
QUESTION: They are in some States.
MR. LAND:

They are not in Georgia.

I can only

speak for Atlanta, Georgia, and the Juvenile Court of Pulton
County, to my knowledge, is not closed to the press.
They can be -there.
But it's contempt of court if they were to publish
those names.

And I find a strong parallel between those

laws protecting juveniles and the laws protecting rape
victims from this kind of publicity.
QUESTION: But the Juvenile Court in Pulton County,
I take it, is closed to the -■*- just the spectators, of idle
general public?

Isn't it?

40

MR. LAND:

My personal — I'm going to have to speak

from personal experience,, since I've never known of any
restriction telling people to stay out.

I don't know.

I would not want to make an assertion to this Court one way
or the other on that.

I could be wrong.

But I know of reporters over there, because of
personal involvement in a case, and they knew all about it.
And you read in the paper that the name of the juvenile was
not released, per Georgia law.
And they also say the same thing about rape cases,
as well.
QUESTION: Do you believe that if you do not prevail
here that the Georgia restraints on publication of the names
of juvenile offenders will also go by the board?
MR. LAND:
QUESTION:

Not -- not in this case, no.
Not in this case, I'm talking about the

general consequences.
MR. LAND:

I think so, yes.

I think you have to

take that view of it, Mr. Justice Burger, if you take an
absolutist view of the First Amendment.

If this case, if

this restriction in this specific case cannot be done
constitutionally within the First Amendment, I see no limits
whatever on the press to invade the privacy of private
citizens completely.
QUESTION: But isn't it narrower than that?

If ‘the

41
— if this Court should hold that the victim's name cannot be
protected, then it is not likely, you're suggesting, that it
would hold that the offender's names would be entitled to
restriction?
MR. LAND;

No, I would not -- I would not propose

to argue the protection of the offender's name, the same,
the social implications and all the other things that go into
a judgment as to what is or is not a matter of public
concern are not present.
I’ve been disagreed with by many people, but I feel
that in this case this specific area, with rape as the
issue, is a wholly different ballgame from all the other
criminal laws on the books.
a judicial

This is a specific area where

initial judicial review has been made, with a

background of the problems involved in rape.
And the Evjue case, the Wisconsin case that was
referred to by counsel for appellants, is right on the point.
Where the Supreme Court of Wisconsin said there might be a
minimal intrusion on freedom of the press, but that slight
intrusion was hardly justification for pinning the name and
identity of the victim of a rape before the public, with an
extreme negative social implication in doing so.
QUESTION;

I gather, Mr. Land, you wouldn't be

arguing the same position if Miss Cohn had been murdered only,
and had not been raped?

42
MR. LAND;
justification.
this

Ccise

No, sir.

No, I would not make the same

I don't think it can follow.

And that's why

truly is narrow.
QUESTION;

And I take it this would be true of

victims of other crimes;

robberies, armed robberies, all

the other ~
MR. LAND; The same social implications do not apply
to those crimes.
QUESTION; Do you know of any case that upholds
against First Amendment challenge, the secrecy of the juvenile
statutes?

Juvenile proceedings.
MR. LAND;

I am not familiar with one.

I do think some of the language in In re Gault,
however, seems to imply the justification for such statutes,
and the references, I believe, in the Briscoe case in
California, in a footnote which referred to your decision in
Tims v. Hill, seemed to imply as well that there were
justifications where they said the First Amendment was not
absolute; and it was a footnote that said "for example, the
identities of victims of rapes are protected in some States",
and then it said "in juvenile proceedings, the names of
juveniles are protected for social, rehabilitative reasons."
And those same reasons are present here.
I would like to speak briefly as to two issues;
one of them the issue of everbreadth that's been brought up;

43

and the other one, on some other examples, and I might take
those other examples first.
I think terribly persuasive is the decision of the
Supreme Court of Massachusetts in Commonwealth v. Wiseman.
There you had an individual, an enterprising individual,, who
took pictures of the State mental institution at Bridgewater,
Massachusetts, in the most extreme detail.
QUESTION; That was the Teaticket Follies.
MR. LAND;

The Teaticket Follies episode.

And

the Court specifically stated in that case that there is
obviously, the state of mental institutions in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts is of the greatest public concern.

But they

did not find that the specific identification of the innates
was of any public interest.
And they
QUESTION;
the law of contracts?
MR. LAND;

Didn't that case arise on the basis of
Wasn't that a contractual agreement?
I know what you're speaking of, that he

violated his ~
QUESTION;

His word, his agreement.

MR. LAND;

— his word, his agreement with. them.

But I don't think that —
QUESTION; That was a contracts law case.
MR. LAND;

I still — I don't believe that that was

the thrust of their decision, though, Your Honor,

I think

44
that the thrust of it was that the identification of the
inmates themselves and, as it said,, at least without a release,
was certainly distinguishable from the cases that were
decided by this Court in Haw York Times vs„ Sullivan, and the
Pentagon Papers case, and cases of tremendous importance to
this country.
1 don’t think -- I think the overbreadth doctrine
has been met by the fact that this statute does not and cannot
be used to invoke indiscriminately liability for invasions
of privacy by themselves.

That the case must be proved on a

standard of negligence and that the

vice of Time v„ Hill

is avoided by the statute itself.
The statute gave fair warning to the press to look
out.

This kind of publication was unlawful in the State of

Georgia.
We do not have what Mr. McAlpin said, the press is
not, because of this case, wondering;

Mi ere next are we

going to be sued for invasion of privacy?
In a sense, I think that although this cause of
action might exist without the statute, I think the vice of
Time y. Hill would be a problem there because they'd have no
notice. And there would be a problem of self“censorship.
That's been avoided by the enactment of this statute.
And for those reasons I believe the case should be
affirmed.

45
Thank you,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Do you have anything further, Mr. McAlpin?
MR, McALPINs

No, Your Honor? thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted,
[Whereupon, at 11:56 o'clock, a.m., the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.]
