PROCEEDINGS
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS:

Mr. Wallace, and Mr. Skillman,

•{

Chief Justice Burger, who is necessarily absent, has asked
me to state that he plans to sit in this case on the basis
of the record and the briefs and the recorded tape that we
have of the oral argument.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP LAWRENCE G. WALLACE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. WALLACE:

Thank you, Mr. Justice Douglas, and

may it please the Court:

This case arose on a petition by

Jersey Cape Broadcasting Corporation, a broadcast licensee
in New Jersey, seeking a declaratory ruling from the Federal
Communications Commission,

Jersey Caps pointed out to the

Commission that the winning number in the New Jersey State
Lottery is selected every Thursday and that many of the
listeners to the broadcast station were interested in learning
what the winning number was and many of them knew that the
broadcast stations were informed of that number on their
wire service and were telephoning the station to ascertain
the number.
The Jersey Cape wanted to know the Commission's
opinion on whether its proposal to broadcast on three succe3 "
save newscasts each Thursday the statement that the winning
State lottery number drawn today is

and recite the number -

whether that would violate section 1304 of title 18 of the

4
United

States Code,

That provision is sat forth in the

Government's brief on page 2, and it provides, summarizing the
pertinent language:

“Whoever broadcasts or" — skipping

down — "knowingly permits the broadcasting of, any advertise­
ment of or information concerning any lottery" — skipping
down three lines — “or any list of the prizes drawn or
awarded by means of any such lotteryf" skipping, “whether
such list contains any part or all of such prises, shall be
fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one
year, or both..”
The Commission's response to this request issued
a declaratory ruling stating that in its view this broadcast,
the proposal, would violate section 1304 of title 18»

It

based this view on an interpretation of this provision that
had been developed in a decision of the Second Circuit Court
of Appeals in 1969 called Hew York State Broadcasters and on
the Commission's further proceedings on remand in that case
which was also a case .involving a declaratory ruling»

In that

case the Second Circuit and the Commission had both held that
the statute applies to legal as well as illegal lotteries and
applies not only to advertisements, but also to information
directly promoting legal or illegal lotteries.

The interpreta­

tion limiting the words "information concerning any lottery,"
was based in part on the face of the statute itself which
goes on to specify "or any list of the prizes drawn or awarded"

5

which would have bean surplusage if Congress had intended to
use the word "information" as comprehensively as possible,
tod X might, add that the interpretation also could quite
properly be based on the fact that at the same time that thi
provision was enacted, Congress re-enacted 47 U.S.C. 326,
which is also set forth on page 2 guaranteeing broadcast
licensees the right of free speech and protection from
censorship by the Commission.
The Commission held with respect to this —
QUESTION:

..

aimed at illegal

I know it. didn't say so.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, Mr. Justice, that question was

addressed by the Second Circuit and by the Commission, and
we hare discussed it in our brief.
QUESTION:

The history of —

There was no such thing as a legal

lottery at the time of the enactment.
MR. WALLACE:

At the time of the enactment of this

particular statute, but this statute is one in a series of
anti-lottery statutes that Congress enacted foreclosing the
channels of interstate commerce and the channels of
communicating regulated by Congress to the promotion of
lotteries, including the use of the mails.

Those statutes

go back to 1327.
. QUESTION:
does it?

It doesn't go because it's gambling,

6
MR. WALLACE:

The 19th century statutes were

enacted at a time when there ware legally authorized lotteries
in the United States.
QUESTION:

What strikes me as funny is that you

can’t broadcast the results of a lottery, but you can broadcast
the results of a horse race, including odds.
MR. WALLACE:

under the. Coeamission’s ruling.

The

only statutory bar that Congress has enacted is on lotteries,
and —
QUESTION:

And the Commission doesn’t impose any-

thing beyond that»
MR. WALLACE:

The Commission does not.

There is a

considerable difference between reporting race results and
reporting a lottery number because the lottery number, as the
Commission pointed out, has no meaning to the general listener
who is not holding a lottery ticket.

It conveys nothing to

die audience other than whether those holding a ticket are
lidding a winning ticket or not, unlike the reports of a
sports contest or a race or

market quotations or other

kinds of broadcasts where people are interested in the market
and die racing.
QUESTION:

Do you think anybody would listen to

horse race results who didn't bet?
MR. WALLACE:
bet.

I know people attend races and don't

7
QUESTION:

You do?

MR. WALLACE:

I have done so.

(Laughter.)
Those people may not be the most expert on what is
happening in the races, but it certainly is true that race
results can be of interest to people who are following the
sport, regardless of whether they bet on the particular race
or whether they bet on any race.
QUESTION;

We don’t have to decide whetiler or not

Congress could do it.

The point is that Congress has singled

out lottery.
MR. WALLACE:

It has singled out lottery, and it

deliberately did so in the course of the development of this
legislation in the 19th century.
in our brief.

We recounted the history

At the time that the word "illegal" was

removed from some of these prohibitions .in 1375 there was
debate specifically on this point.

There were some who

advocated restricting the statutory prohibition only to
illegal lotteries and thought that the function was to aid
the States in their enforcement of the law against lotteries.
But the prevailing view was, no, that lotteries themselves
are an evil even when authorized by State lax*, as the
Louisiana lottery was until almost 20 years later, in 1893,
and that the channels •— the use of the mails should be
forbidden to lotteries.

8
How, in 1934 when, this provision was enacted, there
weren't any legal lotteries in the United States, although
there were legal lotteries elsewhere being conducted elsewhere
for which tickets sometimes attempted to be 3cld in the United
States, and the predominant purpose shown in adopting this
prohibition for broadcasters was to put them in the same
position as publishers of newspapers or circulars who were
forbidden to use the mails for this purpose.

And Congress

drew no distinction on the face of the statute between legal
or illegal lottery, and there is no reason to read one in.
The predominant .intent was to apply the law as it had been
developed with respect to the other lottery prohibitions.
And this Court held in the Rapier case in Volume 146 U.S.
and in the Fabrizio case in Volume 385 U,S., that some of the
other prohibitions do apply to legal as well as illegal
lotteries, as the Second Circuit put it, Congress long since
stopped distinguishing between legal and illegal lotteries
in the lottery legislation.
Now, there have been since the more recent
development of official Stats lotteries, there have been
efforts in Congress to amend the statute to make an exception
for broadcasts concerning the — well, the Attorney General
testified today in support of an amendment which would in
effect moot out this case since this case is merely a
declaratory ruling.

It is still in committee, and we will

9
keep the Court advised of developments»
QUESTION:

(Inaudible)

MR. WALLACE:

The testimony was in the Senate today.

Previously a House subcommittee had reported favorably.
There is controversy in Congress.

There is some

difference of opinion about what form the amendment should
take, whether it should apply to State-authorised lotteries
or only to State-run lotteries, the Department taking the
position that it should apply only to State-run lotteries.
And there are some other questions to be ironed out, let alone
the ultimate question of whether it will be enacted.
QUESTION:

Generally does the Department feel that

something will be forthcoming?
MR. WALLACE:

That is our expectation.

The Depart'

ment. is proposing that Congress act, and the Federal Communica­
tions Commission is deferring to the Department of Justice
on. what Congress should do in this area, and it has consulted
closely with the Department of Justice in its administration
of the statute to the extent it has had occasion to administer
it, mostly in just the declaratory rulings that have come to
the Court's attention,
Now, not only, it seems to us, and the Third Circuit
did not disagree on the legal-illegal aspect, no .basis for —
well, perhaps I should stop and tell the Court what the
Third Circuit did hold in this case after the Commission

10

pointed out that in its view the function of such a broadcast
would be to help in conducting the lottery and the number would
be of interest only to the limited class of persons holding
lottery tickets and would serve only that function.
QUESTION:

Limited class.

Isn't it a majority of

the adults in New Jersey?
MR. WALLACE:
million persons.

Well» some two and three-quarter

This is an atypical first amendment case

in that regard» Mr. Justice.

It is usually a minority interest

of some kind that is seeking protection from the courts
against legislation in a first amendment case.

We concede»

however, that the majority is also protected by the first
amendment.
QUESTION:

It’s a free press case, not a free

speech case.
MR. WALLACE:

It is put in those terms.

There is a

first amendment claim here.
QUESTION:

It's the claim of the broadcasters, not

tiie claim of the listeners.

No listeners went to the Commission

or to the courts.
MR. WALLACE:

Well» the broadcaster is not in this

Court, only the New Jersey State Lottery Commission is in the
Court.
QUESTION;

The Broadcaster went to the Commission.

MR. WALLACE:

They .'want to the Commission, and after

11
the Commission’s ruling/ the New Jersey State lottery
Commission petitioned for rehearing/ saying it was aggrieved
by the ruling.

The broadcaster did not seek rehearing, nor

did the broadcaster seek a review in the Court of Appeals.
It was the State Lottery Commission who pointed out the large
numbers of people who were interested,and the

Commission's

response was —■ and they also pointed out that they had no
way of knowing who had what number; they had no record of
who won the lottery.

It was important for them to disseiainate

the number to the ticket holder in order to consummate the
lottery.

And the Commission said this just reconfirms our

view that the function of this is an ingredient of the lottery,
rather than the kind of discussion or commentary upon the
lottery or documentary that is not proscribed by section 1304.
QUESTION;

Mr. Wallace, I think you just agreed with

my brother Stev/art that it's the free press, not free speech?
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION;

Well, I said it can be termed that.

The reason I ask is, of course, 326, as

X read the Third Circuit opinion, they turned it both on 326
and first amendment f did they not?
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

They did, Mr. Justice.

And the wording of 326 is free speech.

If says nothing about free press.
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Mr. Justice.

Do you think that 326, right of free

.12

speech* includes the free press guarantee?

Do you think

32S is involved here?
MR. WALLACE:

Well* our view of 326 is that except

for procedural limitations on the ability of the Commission to
issue restraining orders* by way of censorship* and that is
hot involved here* the Commission issued no restraining order
of any kind, that it provides for the protection of the first
amendment.
Now* it specifies only the right of free speech.

It

doesn't really matter since the first amendment protects the
freedom of the press whether 326 reiterates that or not.
we haven't taken a position on it.
QUESTION:

So

It seems immaterial.

Certainly Judge Gibbons1 opinion reads

more like the free press emphasis on news and so forth* than
it does on free speech.

It must be that at least he thought

the right cf free speech that 326 embraces also the free
press guarantee.
MR. WALLACE:

That seems to be the implication.

It

was a unanimous opinion for the court en banc.
In the first place the opinion draws no distinction
between legal or illegal lotteries, doesn't question the
Commission's holding that the statute applies to legal lotteries,
and its rationale would seem to apply to a newscast announcement
of the winning number of an illegal lottery as much as it
applies here.

Its rationale is based entirely on the fact

13
that this is considered news by the licensee and he wants to
announce it on his newscast and that is an exercise of
protecting broadcast journalism in the Court's view which
the implication is the first amendment wouldn't allow Congress
to interfere with, and then the Court proceeded to interpret
the statute as not reaching it, by holding that the statute
applies only to — well, I hesitate to say only to advertise­
ments — only to promotions as they put it. At the bottom of
page 10 of our brief we have the relevant excerpt, restricting
the application to promotion of lotteries for which the
licensee receives compensation.

Whether that would include

a sponsored newscast isn't made entirely clear, but presumably
it would not.

That would be protected.

If the sponsor of the

newscast were the New Jersey State Lottery Commission, I
don't know what the Third Circuit's view would be.

But that

is the line dravm, and perhaps it would be a line drawn
between a newscast sponsored by -the New Jersey State lottery
Commission, which is known to announce its winning number each
Thursday, or an announcement, sponsored by the New Jersey State
Lottery Commission of the winning number each Thursday,
it doesn't seem like a vary persuasive line to us.

So

If there

is a constitutional right to have this announcement made and
the licensee is willing to sell the time to the New Jersey
State Lottery Commission, why doesn't: the New Jersey State
Lottery Commission have the right to males it?

Is the New

14
Jersey State Lottery Commission exercising the right of freedom
of the press in that situation?
The implications of the New York Times v. Sullivan
would be that an advertiser is speaking as a part of the
press when he publishes an editorial advertisement.
QUESTION;

In the New York Timas case the defendant

was not the advertiser; he was the New York Times.
MR. WALLACE;

That is correct.

There could be debate

about whether when the Commission licenses someone,* the
Commission is thereby giving him a right that someone else
sold broadcast time by the licensee does not have under the
first amendment.

We think not, at least in the context of this

case.
As we see the case, it does involve basically a
constitutional issue since there Congress deliberately chose
to say "or information" as well as advertisements, and it is
only under the constraint of the constitutional holding that
a court would be justified in effect striking that language
from the statute.

And we get our lav/ basically on this subject

from the two recent decisions which we think are the closest
in point, one the Capital Broadcasting case in which this
Court in a summary affirmance upheld the constitutionality of
the statutory bar of cigarette advertising on the airwaves,
and the other the Pittsburgh Press case.

They are both

holding in the opinion dealing with limitations that can be

IS
imposed on certain kinds of advertising, which we take also
to apply to promotional announcements that would not be
compensated.
case

The examples given in the Pittsburgh Press

were that the Court had no doubt that there could be a

ban on want ads proposing sale of narcotics or soliciting
prostitutes.

I take it this would be true whether the want ad

were run as a public service or whether it was paid for by
the sponsor or whether it was the newspaper publisher itself
that was selling the narcotics and ran an announcement where
they could be purchased from the newspaper.

And it seems to

us that this is the basic principle theit governs here.

The

participation in a lottery is not a constitutionally protected
activity.

It’s an activity that can be suppressed by the

. proper government.

In this case, some States have seen fit

to authorise lotteries run by those States, but it is still
Congress that has the authority to decide what uses are
impermissible over the airwaves.

If it has decided that

promoting the sale of cigarettes or promoting the sale p£
lottery tickets is a use to which the airwaves should not be
put, this is within

the constitutional power of Congress, so

long as it doesn't impinge upon the right fully to discuss,
debate, and inform the public about the conduct of the affairs
of such an enterprise.
In this case, it seems to us to be an extreme
example of an application of the statute which does not cut

16
off any information to the public because the numbers mean
nothing outside of the context of role in consumating the
lottery.
May I reserve the balance of ray time?
MR» JUSTICE DOUGLAS.

Mr. Stillman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OP STEPHEN SKILLMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SKILLMAN:
the Court:

Mr. Justice Douglas, and may it please

This appeal involves solely the questions whether

the lottery provision of the Federal Communications Act,
section 304, prohibits broadcasters from broadcasting winning
lottery numbers as part of regular news shows, and that the
lobbery provision may be read to reach that far, whether it
violates the free speech and free press guarantees of the
first amendment.
Section 304 by its terras prohibits the broadcasting
of any advertisement of or information concerning any lottery.
It should be clear initially, as I believe has been conceded
by the FCC, that this section cannot be read literally to
prohibit any mention whatever by broadcasters of information
relating to the lottery.

If there were any notion that it

could be or should be or is intended to be read this way, it
would be patently unconstitutional because it would prohibit,
for example, even discussion of information about the lottery
iii

the context of an editorial condemning the lottery or

17
encouraging the lotteryr or so forth.

So such an interpreta­

tion would be clearly unconstitutional*, and for that reason*
the FCC has conceded that a strictly literal reading of the
statute would be inappropriate.
QUESTION;

On the other hand* could the Congress

validly prohibit the station from"itself conducting a lottery
over the airwaves?
MR. SKILLMLNs

I would think, your Honor* that it

could* although even the response to that question may have
been confused somewhat by the passage of time and the
widespread circumistances under which other types of gambling
operations are at least advertised on radio and television.
But I think despite the changes that have occurred in the
last few years* the answer today is probably still yes.
QUESTIONi

hnd if .it were found here and validly

so that the station was actually participating in the conduct
of a lottery* would you have the same result?
MR. SKiLLMhIJ:

I think that would be a far different

case* if the station were a participant in the lottery as
distinguished from exercising editorial judgment and seeking
to meet a public demand for information.

That would be a

far different case from the one that is in fact before the
Court.
QUESTIONS

What if the only place you could get

information as to the lottery winning number was over the

13

radio?
MR. SKILIMAN:

I would be inclined

— in fact, that

is not true.
QUESTION:

No, but what if it were.

MR. SKXLLMAN:

That, if anything, raight exacerbate

the first amendment problem.

Certainly it would cut off

people who have an interest in lottery, cut them off from all
information about lottery, and I would think for that reason
we would make the problem even more severe perhaps.
theoretical.

That is

There are many other sources of information as

to the winning lottery number, including the newspapers, for
one, as well as postings at various lottery locations.
If it is once conceded that a literal interpretation
of 1304 is inappropriate, then the question becomes what
does the section mean?

I think in addressing ourselves to

that question, it is important, to bear in mind that there
wore no legal lotteries at the time section 1304 was included
in the Federal Communications Act, and it is therefore clear
that even if 1304 may be said to be addressed to legal lotteries
as well as illegal lotteries, because the distinction is
not specifically drawn in the statute, that nonetheless it
must toe read in a manner consistent with the setting in
which it was enacted, and by this I mean that at that time,
in 1334, there could have been no conception in the minds of
the Members of Congress that there would be a legal State

19
lottery which would be of such widespread public interest that
there might be the type of public demand for the winning
lottery number that could lead the broadcast news media in the
exercise of its editorial discretion to conclude that there
was a public demand to know the winning number and that
therefore it should be included as part of a regular news
show.
I think, secondly, that 1304 must be construed in
light of section 1302.

The SEC has urged this point in stating

that 1304 applies to legal as well as illegal lotteries.
we are not disputing that point.

And

But X think if the SEC is

going to rely on 1302 for that conclusion, then it is also
fair for us to rely on 1302 for the further conclusion that
the newspapers — that there is no prohibition and has been
no prohibition in the past on the newspapers including as part
of a news article the winning number in a lottery and for
those newspapers to be sent through the mail.
Starting with several early cases in the 1880*3
which are cited in our brief, the Commerford and Mason cases,
the courts in those cases •— they were not decisions of this
Court, but lower Federal courts ~~ construed the lottery
prohibitions of 1302 on use of the mails very, very strictly,
end taking the promise that 1304 was patterned after 1302,
it is appropriate for this Court to give .1304 a similarly narrow
construction

20
It. also must be kept in mind that 1304 is a penal
statute.

A violation of 1304 by a newscaster could lead to

incarceration and/or a fine.

It is therefore,

to construe

1304 3trictly and to apply it only to those commercial ventures,
commercial situations which are clearly within its parameters.
QUESTION;

Getting back, Mr. Skiliman, to your

suggestion that there were no legal lotteries when the statute
was adopted, are you also arguing that we ought in that light
4

to construe this statute as not including legal lotteries in
order to avoid reaching the first amendment?
MR. SKILLMAN;

We are not taking the position, your

Honor, that 1304 does not apply to legal lotteries.

We think

that in light of the legislative background of 1302 and the
fact that 1304 was patterned after 1302, that we would probably
have to make that concession.

And I might add that all of the
i

0

members of the Second Circuit that have considered this issue,
as well as all the members of the Third Circuit who considered
this issue have —
QUESTION: The reason I asked, I notice

.. your brief

at page 12 has a sentence, "Accordingly, Section 1304 should be
construed so as to avoid these substantial constitutional
■problems," citing the Machinists v. Street.
ME. SKILLMAN:

The substantial constitutional problems

to which we refer are the basic free speech and free press
problems.

21

QUESTION:

I know, but if we could construet' 1304

as not including legal lotteries, obviously, we would not have
to reach the
MR. SKILLMAN:

I think that if you could do that,

that that would avoid the first amendment problem, but I would
have some difficulty urging the Court that it should reach
that conclusion in light of legislative history.
There are, however, very, very substantial first
amendment problems in this case.

If the Court comes to tna

conclusion that 1304 must be —
QUESTION;

How do you suggest that we construe 1304?

To exclude what?
MR. SKILLMAN;

To exclude winning lottery numbers

that are.broadcast as part of a regular news show.

That is the

only question —
QUESTION:

Whether the lottery is legal or illegal.

MR. SKILLMAN:

That would not matter.

I do think that if they were broadcasting illegal
lottery numbers as part of a news show, that there might be.
questions aa to whether it was fulfilling it3 obligations under
tno public interest standard of the Communications Act.

So

I am not suggesting that —
QUESTION:

They are different.

MR. SKILLMAN:

That would be a different question,

but what we are talking about here is the-exercise of editorial

22

discretion by a broadcaster.

And there are various kinds

of topics, X think, that generally we see less moral approval
than lotteries and gambling that are the subject of news
broadcasts.

We could take prostitution, for example, as the

subject of news broadcasts and a feature broadcast, whether
xt be legal prostitution in the few counties where that is in
Nevada or illegal prostitution in Times Square in New York.
QUESTION;

They don't give telephone numbers, though,

do they?
MR. SKILLMAN:

They do, your Honor, indicate where

legal prostitution takes place, which may be even more
helpful information for an interested party than the type of
information that the State of Nev; Jersey — that the broad­
casters are providing.
QUESTION;
Jersey.

What if lotteries were illegal in New

Would you say that the first amendment prohibited the

State of New Jersey malting punishable the broadcast that the
broadcasters sought to make here?
MR. SKILLMAN:
QUESTION;

If they were illegal —

If they were illegal.

MR. SKILLMAN;

I think we could still have first

amendment problems, your Honor, but it would certainly be
a much more difficult case.

I think the element of legality

versus illegality is a significant one.

But I think that if

we made an attempt to completely prohibit the broadcast

23

news media from mentioning winning numbers, there still might
he first amendment problems.

It would be a coarser first

amendment case, but I think there still would be a first
amendment issue that might be raised there by the broadcasters.
There are only certain narrow exceptions to first
amendment protection for speech, such as the broadcasting of
winning lottery numbers.
for commercial speech.

One recognized exception is that
I think that is significant here

because it is commercial speech cases that the FCC is relying
upon.

It relied upon the Capital Broadcasting Company case

which involved the congressional legislation prohibiting
broadcasting of cigarette advertisements.

They have relied

heavily on the Pittsburgh Press Company case which sustained
a Pittsburgh ordinance prohibiting 3ex~based advertisements
for employment#

both cases clearly arising .in the context

of commercial speech where the author of the communication was
seeking his own commercial gain.

Here, by contrast, the

author of the communication i3 the broadcast news media who
are providing this information to the public in response to
what they have decided in their editorial judgment is a
public demand for the information.

The commanication is thus

at the very heart of the first araendment.
QUESTION:

You represent the State of New Jersey,

don’t you?
MR. SKILLMAN:

That is correct, your Honor.

24

QUESTION:

And doesn't the State have a commercial

interest in this?
Mi*. SKILLMAN:

I think the State does have a commercial

interest, although I might say —
QUESTION:

(Inaudible)

MR. SKILLMAN:

Its-

as well as they expected.

. commercial interest here

is

in producing revenue for education and for public institutions,
so perhaps it's a commercial interest of a different dimension
than that that is involved in the other commercial speech
cases.
But the first amendment interest —
QUESTION:

Would this foe a different case, do you

suppose, if the facts were these, that you had offered to pay
the broadcasting company so much per spot announcement of the
winning number every Thursday and it had expressed a willingness
to accept your offer and then done everything else as is in this
case, had gone to the Commission, and the Commission said, "No,
sorry."
MR. SKILLMAN:

That would be a totally different

case.
QUESTION:

A totally different case?

MR. SKILLMAW:

we still might be before this Court arguing that the FCC had

But I think it would be a

I think it would be a much harder case.

In

this case we have no payment of money by the State, and we are
not the author of the communication.

It's rather the

broadcaster who is doing this in response to what it conceives
to be a public demand for the information.
QUESTION:

Weil, the court's opinion in Pittsburgh

Press didn’t speak in terms of an overwhelming or compelling
State demand, did it?

It simply said it was a permissible

State policy.
MR. SKILLMANj

It did not speak in those terms, your

Honor, because it found the speech to be commercial speech.
In that sense, perhaps I did misspeak myself in responding to
Mr. Justice Stewart.

,

But in this context, once we get away from commercial
speech into news broadcasting, clearly a compelling, overwhelm­
ing public interest is required to sustain any type of
restriction upon the press.
QUESTION:

Mr. Skillinan, I think I am bothered a

little, too, because I sense in your remarks that public
interest is a definite factor in news.

Information becomes

26

news because there is a public interest in it.

I think this

is what you are saying.
What if a lady’s aid society of some church in Cape
May, Hew Jersey, had a raffle and there was intense interest
in Cape May but nowhere else in the State of New Jersey, would
this be news as you regard it and broadcastable?
MR. SKILLMANs

I think that that might depend on a

factual .inquiry as to whether the broadcast were made by the
broadcaster as an accommodation to the group that is holding
the raffle, in which event one might not classify this as news,
or whether the broadcaster came to the conclusion in its
editorial judgment that there is sufficient public interest
in the information that wholly apart from the accommodation of
the persons holding the raffle, that there is public demand
for the information.
news.

Then I would say, yes, that it would be

It really comes down to that process, who is the author

of the communication?

And if it can be said that it is the

press, that then it is protected by the first amendment.
QUESTION:

let me ask you one more question while.

I have you interrupted.

Do you distinguish between broadcasting

the news of winners as was the case in the Second Circuit
case and broadcasting the numbers as is the Third Circuit
situation?
MR. SKILLMAN:

No.

I think conceptually if the

broadcaster reasonably comes to the conclusion that the names

21

of winners are newsworthy, and certainly there have been front
page news news and even television features in Hew Jersey about
the winners of the millionaire lottery.

There is tremendous

t

public interest in someone who is made a millionaire overnight,
and I have no doubt whatever, and I don’t think the FCC has
even taken the position that that type of communication falls
within 1304.
QUESTION:

Even though it is information concerning

a lottery.
MR. SKILLMAH:

That is correct.

On a very technical

analysis of the information concerning a lottery, and I think
that is the reason that even the FCC concedes that a literal
analysis, a literal construction of 1304 would not be
inappropriate — excuse me, would not be appropriate.
The second basic exception to first amendment
protections which is relied upon by the FCC are those cases
dealing with communications in furtherance of illegal
activity, such as mail fraud schemes or misrepresentations in
advertisements that maybe endanger the health of the purchasers
of consumer products.

All of those cases,, however, deal with

communication by the parties engaged in the illegal enterprise
for their own profit.

The cases are thus closely, related to

the commercial speech cases and do not implicate the basic
rights of the press under the first amendment.
all of those cases deal with illegal activities.

And, secondly,
The mail

28

fraud, the misrepresentation in advertising is declared to be
illegal, and for that reason the public interest in preventing
that form of communication is evident.
Here, on the other hand, the subject of this
communication, winning lottery numbers, is itself clearly
legal under State law and as far a3 Federal laiv is concerned,
I think it must be concluded that the Federal position is
ambivalent at best.

The Federal Government has imposed

certain restrictions, such as that contained in 1304, whatever
it may mean, but in other instances it has permitted Federal
banks, for example, to handle recordkeeping and the handling
of money in connection with lottery, it has permitted the
mailing of newspapers and other communications through the
mail.

So you have an ambivalent Federal position.
Therefore, on any view of the first amendment, the

restriction that the FCC's expansive interpretation of 1304
imposes on broadcasting could only be sustained if there were
some overriding public interest.

But the FCC has not urged

even any significant public interest in their brief in this
case.

They merely made the conclusory statement that lotteries

are suppressible.

The point is that they haven't been

suppressed, that they are legal, and that the broadcast news
media in its editorial discretion has concluded that there is
sufficient public interest that the public should be advised
as to the results of the lotteries.

For this reason the

communica.tions enjoy first amendment protection, and if the
Court finds that 1304 must he interpreted to reach this type
of communication,

and we submit that it doesn't have to

interpret 1304 iii this manner, then that statute would be
unconstitutional in these applications.
Thank you.

Mr. Wallace, I believe you

have six minutes left.
REBUTTAL-ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. WALLACE:

All right.

Let me first say that the Department of Justice*
view is not that newspapers listing winning numbers can be
mailed without violating 1302, and our understanding is that
most newspapers leave the winning numbers out of the mail
editions.

That is why they are often printed in a little

box by themselves.
QUESTION:

Suppose you have an interview with a

millionaire winner?
MR. WALLACE:

That is not bound by 1304 under the

Commission's view', spelled out on the remand in Mew York State
Broadcasters, and that is on page. 849 of 21 FCC 2d, paragraph
11, deals with interviews with persons having winning lottery
tickets, relating among other matters of general interest,
the number of tickets they purchased, their expectation of

30

winning a price, their reaction upon learning they held winning
tickets, and what they did or intend to do with the prize money.
QUESTION:

It is information concerning a lottery.

MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

Yes.

What page was that?

MR. WALLACE:

That is on page 843 of 21 PCC 2d.

The whole opinion on remand starts at 846.
QUESTION:

What is the distinction?

MR. WALLACE:

Well, the Commission and the Second

Circuit said that the word "information" has to be .interpreted
narrov/ly to apply only to information directly promoting a
lottery and not to interviews, commentaries, documentaries —
QUESTION:
*

MR. WALLACE:

people where to buy lottery tickets and urging them to —
QUESTION:

An awful lot of people run out and buy

them in consequence.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, the same thing, people might be

encouraged to buy tickets by a news program about the aid to
education that has resulted from lottery receipts, and so
fortli, but these are all considered matters of legitimate
news interest that are not primarily promotions of the lottery.
QUESTION:

You say if the publication, promotes an

activity that the Congress has the constitutional power to

31

proscribe, then it is constitutional.

And it is also within

tne coverage of 1304.
MR. WALLACE:

Yes, that Congress has the power to

deny the usfe of the mails or of the broadcast media to promote
activities that Congress believes are injurious to the
public, and —
QUESTION:

You say constitutionally.

MR. WALLACE:

I thought that was much of what the

holding was in the Capital Broadcasting case with regard to
cigarette advertising.

If the exact same jingles or testi-

monials ware repeated voluntarily by the broadcaster on
something that he called newscasts, I don't see the
constitutional difference,
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, you can have the story and

the pictures and all of the man winning the million dollars.
That is O.K.
MR. WALLACE:

That is the Commission's interpretation

of 1304.
QUESTION:

Could you announce the number of the

winning ticket on that program?
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

No.

Well —

No.

MR. WALLACE:

The Commission hasn’t spoken to that.

It would be most difficult.
QUESTION:

First you said you can’t announce the

32

number.
MR. WALLACE:

Yes.

Weill, what the Commission dealt

with in tliis case is a proposal that the number be announced
weekly at the time of the drawing on a newscast so that
someone buying a lottery ticket would know that he could tune
in next Thursday and know whether he held the winning ticket
or not.

That's a different case from a public interest

interview which the Commission really hasn’t spoken to.
QUESTION:

But the point is that that encourages

lottery playing more so than to tell somebody that they won.
MR. WALLACE:
CUESTION:

Yes.

Congress.

And that question is pending before

The Attorney General has testified that he thinks

they should be amended.

But Congress has adopted a policy

judgment here which in the view of many may be quaint now,
but it is still entitled to the respect of the Department of
Justice and of the Federal Communications Commission, and, in
our view, .of the. courts, because it was a permissible policy
judgment, it was based on determination spelled out in some
detail — if you would like a citation — in
Record

4 Congressional

326.1 to 4264, that lotteries are injurious to people

even if they are legally sponsored and therefore the word

33

"illegal" should be removed from the statute and that view
prevailed in Congress, and most States today do not permit
lotteries.

There is still a large body of opinion in this

country that these lotteries are injurious.
Now, some suggestion has been, made that even though
activities are protected by the first amendment, broadcast
on a newscast might be protected by the first amendment,
this would be all right because the Commission nevertheless
could in applying the public interest limitations on licensees
discipline the licensee for engaging in such a broadcast.
I find this a little hard to imagine, the Commission applying
the sanction for an action that is constitutionally protected.
If it is constitutionally protected to broadcast the winning
number of an illegal lottery, why is that then a basis for
Commission discipline?

I have thought from Pittsburgh Press

and Capital Broadcasting that it was fairly clear that it
would

be

'interpreted

’

it could be, the Government

could prevent a broadcaster from announcing daily on a
newscast where is the best place to buy narcotics today in a
way similar to the announcement of where the traffic is
flowing better, over which bridges, from the helicopter.
It seemed to roe that was the implication of those opinions
and that the first amendment issue is not of such difficulty
here as to justify tampering with the plain words of the
statute and the intent and history behind them.
