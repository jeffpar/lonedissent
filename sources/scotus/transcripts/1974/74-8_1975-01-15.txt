MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in No. 74~8, O’Connor against Donaldson,
Mr. Gearey, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RAYMOND W. GEAREY, ESQ..
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, GEAREYs

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court?
I am Raymond Gearey, Assistant Attorney General of
the State of Florida, representing the Petitioner, Dr.
0'Connor,
We have here this morning the case of Kenneth
Donaldson, the respondent, who was involuntarily civilly
committed to the Florida State Hospital in early 1957.

He

was committed following a hearing before a County Court judge,
where he was found to be mentally ill, a danger to himself
and others, and at that point was committed to the hospital
for care, maintenance, and treatment.

That being the

language of the Florida statute at that time.
QUESTION?

Who initiated the commitment proceedings?

I couldn’t find it.
MR. GEAREY?

It was initiated, I believe, by his

family, his mother and father
QUESTION;
parents?

One of his parents, or both of his

MR, GEAREY:
QUESTION:
MR. GEAREY:

— who were resident of
Florida?
— Pinellas County, Florida.

Nov;, at the time of his admission, among other
things, he requested, due to his Christian Scientist beliefs,
that he not be treated with drugs or shock therapy.
Now, throughout his hospitalization, those requests
were periodically renewed, and at times he did actually
refuse drug therapy.
In addition, he frequently refused offers of various
other forms of therapy, when they were indeed offered. These
were non-medical forms of therapy, such as group therapy,
occupational therapy, et cetera.
QUESTION s The court found that he had not been
offered, if I recall correctly, *— or the jury, the jury’s
finding is that he had not been offered occupational therapy.
Is that not correct?
MR. GEAREY:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, 1 believe

at one time ■—
QUESTION:

The Court of Appeals of the Fifth

Circuit seemed to focus on that.
MR. GEAREY:

There was some question as to that,

I believe that in actuality it was offered, he accepted for a
time, and then refused to participate further.
And I believe on one other occasion when it was

5

offered* he said that he would not participate again*
Now* there is some question from time to time as to
how he reacted when the^herapy was offered* and whether the
therapy was explained to him* in various forms.
But we believe that many forms of therapy were
indeed offered and were knowingly refused by Mr. Donaldson*
for various reasons»
QUESTIONs

As you read this record* what was the

latest date — just the year would be enough to aid me — when
he refused some form of therapy that was offered to him?
MR. GEAREY:
QUESTION;

Well* he was —
He itfas there fifteen years* wasn't he;

fifteen years* more or less?
MR» GEAREY;

Yes* sir* he was in about fourteen

years in the hospital.
Noxtf* I believe* right up to the end* he would have
refused shock therapy.

Towards the end of his confinements

the last two years* roughly* I believe* he did begin to agree
to accept drug therapy from Dr. Gum. an is * who is one of the
de fendants,
The drug therapy was tried.

They felt it had little

or no effect upon his illness* and it was discontinued.

But

it was not until the last* approximately * two years of his
hospitalization that he accepted drug therapy at all.
Now* throughout his hospitalization he was tested and

6

examined several times by the staff psychiatrists, psychoXo~
gists.

At some occasions he would refuse to be examined.

But each time, until the end, when it was agreed he should
be released, the conclusion was always the sames

that Mr.

Donaldson was mentally ill, and his confinement should
continue.
QUESTIONs

In that respect, Mr. Gearey, how did it

come about that he was finally released after these many
years?
MR. GEAREY;

Well, he received a new attending

physician late in 1970 or early 1971, and that attending
physician determined that, in his judgment, Mr, Donaldson was
indeed fit to be released from the hospital,
QUESTION s

This is one who succeeded the doctor

who is a party then, here?
MR, GEAREY;

Yes,

Dr. O’Connor, the petitioner,

whom I represent, was Mr. Donaldson's attending physician
very early in his confinement, up until about 1958 or '59.
At that time, Dr. O'Connor became Clinical Director of the
hospital, and another doctor took over Mr. Donaldson's care.
And later Dr. O'Connor became Superintendent of the hospital.
And at the — towards the end, the new attending
physician determined that Mr. Donaldson had indeed improved
to the point where he should be returned to society, and he
was indeed released in mid-1971.

I believe it -was late July

7
or early August.
And at that tine there had also been a change of
administration in the hospital, and it was the opinion of the
new Superintendent, based upon the reports given to him by
the physicians, that Mr. Donaldson should be released.
QUESTION;

I take it that Dr. O’Connor at all times

had the power, in the Florida system, to release him?
MR. GEAREYs

Yes, sir, he did.

And the record

reflects that at all times during his tenure as superintendent,
based upon the advice given him by the attending physicians
and the consensus of staff conferences, that Mr. Donaldson
should not be released.
How, at several staff conferences, ~
QUESTION;

But he didn’t have the

did he have

the power to release him unless he arrived at the conclusion
that he had progressed sufficiently to be released?
MR, GEAREY;

No, Mr. Justice White, I believe Dr,

O'Connor stated, and the record reflects, that he did not
believe that he could release Mr, Donaldson until Mr.
Donaldson was cured.
Now, there were certain temporary forms of release
that were available.

These were such things as trial visits.

There was an out-of-Stafce release procedure, whereby a man,
although not restored to his competency and given a final
discharge, could be released from the hospital for temporary

8

periods of time.
QUESTION;

Was not that refused here?

MR. GEAREY;

In this case.

Yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun, it was.

Towards the end, at one of the last staff conferences, the
consensus was that perhaps Mr. Donaldson should be offered
either a trial visit or an out-of~State release, I believe
they called it.
They offered him a trial visit with his family, and
he refused.

And the record reflects that, quite accurately.

QUESTION;

Of course, this fellow Lembcke,up in

New York, tried for years to get him released.
MR. GEAREY;

Yes, sir, there were two efforts to have

Mr. Donaldson released;

one, Mr. Lembeke$ and one, the

Helping Hands Organization in Minnesota.
Dr. O’Connor testified, and the other doctors, the
record reflects, believed that it would have been a dis~
service to Mr. Donaldson to release him at that point; they
felt him mentally ill, and felt that he could not receive
adequate supervision from these organizations or from Mr.
Lembcke, an individual.
Dr. O’Connor stated at one point that he felt that
it would have been a disservice to Mr. Donaldson to have
released him.
QUESTION;
supervision"?

What do you mean by a "adequate

This record almost shows he didn't have any

9

supervision here at all, did he?
MR. GEAREY:

Other than confinement*

Well, he had — he had the supervision

and the treatment that was available at the hospital and to
which he would submit.
They believed he did need supervision of the form
offered at the hospital and not available from an individual
on the outside.
Dr. O'Connor firmly believed that Mr. Donaldson
remained mentally ill.

That is really the basis of his

refusals to —QUESTION:

Incidentally, is it agreed on the part of

the State and the appellants here, that Mr. Donaldson was not
dangerous, either to himself or to others?
MR. GEAREY:

Well, there %i/as some question as to that.

Now, when he was committed, idle forms stated that he was
considered dangerous to himself and others.

In 1965, Mr.

Donaldson had been conducting a letter-writing campaign with
public officials, protesting his hospitalization.
A Member of the Legislature became concerned, and
requested an outside opinion.

A doctor was brought in from

Jacksonville, who had never met Mr. Donaldson before, had no
contact with his case prior to that time, and his opinion was
that Mr. Donaldson was mentally ill and indeed dangerous.
There were some on the staff who believed him
dangerous? there were some who did not.

10

QUESTION:

Aren't you bound by the jury's verdict

to a certain extent on that?

Didn't the district judge

charge that in order for them to recover, they would have to
find he was not dangerous?
MR. GEAREY:

Yes, sir, to some extent x^e are.

There

was a charge to that —
QUESTION:

Well, let me put another:

To what

extent aren't you bound by it?
MR. GEAREY:

Well, I think we would have to say we

were bound by the jury’s findings in that regard.

Because

they were instructed to that effect.
Now, as I said, several times the matter was brought
up to staff conference, and the consensus was -- and this is
what Dr. O’Connor relied upon -- that Mr, Donaldson did remain
mentally ill and should be hospitalized.
Nov/, throughout his hospitalization, Mr. Donaldson
brought some 14 or 15 suits seeking release, challenging the
quality of his treatment, and these were brought in the State
courts and lower federal courts, and all x^ere fairly
summarily dismissed.
Four of them reached this Court, and certiorari was
denied.
This particular suit —QUESTION:

Have you cited all those habeas

applications, incidentally?

11
MR* GEAREYs
QUESTIONS

The —
All of them?

MR. GEAREYs

Not all of them are cited in the brief.

We did mention the four that reached this Court, and I believe
one or two that reached the Florida Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

I, for one, would appreciate it if you

could supply information as to those, their citations, at least
their case numbers if they're not reported.
MR. GEAREYs

Certainly, sir.

QUESTION; And submit those at your convenience.
QUESTION;

Were there evidentiary hearings in any

of those habeas corpus proceedings?
MR, GEAREYs

Mr. Justice Powell, I'm not certain.

We have very little knowledge of what did go on in those cases,
I do not believe there were any substantial evidentiary
hearings held in any of those cases.
But that would be -■» that would have to be something
we would have to further research.

Information wasn't available

to us at the time we submitted the case to you.
But I would ~~ I think I could safely say that the
evidentiary hearings were not held,
QUESTION; Were there any opinions written by District
judges in any of those
MR. GEAREYs

cases?
Not to my knowledge.

I believe they

were just summary dismissals, for lack of either case or

12
controversy, or lack of a cause of action.
QUESTION:

While I have you interrupted, would you

summarise briefly the procedure that took place at the time
of respondent's commitment, what did Florida law then
require?
MR. GEAREY:

Okay.

Under Florida lax-/ in 1957, the

law required a petition on behalf of a number of citizens,
that they felt a particular individual needed —* was mentally
ill and needed care.
The due process procedures, which were present,
were notice, a hearing, an opportunity to be heard at the
hearing on all relevant evidence.
QUESTION:

Hearing before whom?

MR. GEAREYs

Before a County Court judge.

It was a

judicial hearing in all respects, and the subject, the
patient — the subject of the petition had the right to
counsel or appointed counsel, and there were provisions in
the statute for the indigents who could not supply witness
fees or other related fees; the State would waive those.
And so we believe that there was a full hearing
with full due process.
Nox-/,

that’s one element of what really goes into

this alleged right to treatment, which I will be getting to
shortly.
But, to summarize it briefly, he received full due

13

process;

notice, hearing, witnesses, counsel if desired;

and there was expert testimony from two physicians,
QUESTION;

Is the record of that hearing included

in the record of this case?
MR. GEAREY;

No, sir, it is not.

The petitions that

were filed at the time are part of the record,

I don't believe

that a transcript or copy of the hearing is part of the record
in this case,
QUESTION;

Just one more question along these lines;

Has there been provision under Florida law that would have
enabled the respondent to petition on his own motion within
the State procedure for release, or was habeas his only legal
remedy?
MR. GEAREY;

I believe release was available on a

petition from the patient.
QUESTION;
MR. GEAREY;

And you say you believe — is there
Yes, sir, I believe that under the

statute at that time there were several ways the patient could
receive release, and a petition from the patient was one of
them.
If he felt he was cured, he could petition for a
release, and a hearing would apparently have been held.
QUESTION;

Would he petition the court?

MR. GEAREY;

Yes, I believe he would have petitioned

the court which had committed him originally.

14
QUESTION: Was any such petition filed by respondent?
MR* GEAREY:

Ho, sir, not in this case that I'm

aware of.
QUESTION*:

Would you say that in that petition he

would have the burden of proving that he'd been cured?
Before petition could prevail?
MR. GEAREY;

Under the 1957 law, I feel the burden

probably would have been on the patient, to have shown that
he was cured,
QUESTION:
MR. GEAREY:
QUESTION:

To show that he was cured?
Yes, sir,
And this is a situation where in fact

he had no treatment, isn't it?
MR, GEAREY:

Well, I — that's really the question

here, whether there had been treatment.

And of course we

submit that there was treatment,
QUESTION:

Incidentally, due process hearing which

you just described, was that at the time of the initial
commitment?
MR. GEAREY;
QUESTION:

Yes, it was.
Unh-hunh, and there had been no other

State proceeding, comparable State proceeding, since?
MR. GEAREY;

No, there wasn't.

QUES TION:

Unh~h unh.

QUESTION:

According to your statement of the case,

15
on page 4 of your brief, he could have been released upon his
►

application, if there were no objections from the head of the
hospital.

That's the way I read it,
MR- GEAREY:
QUESTIONS

That’s correct,
That is just his application, I suppose,

to the hospital itself,
MR, GEAREY:
QUESTIONS

Yes # and I expect *»And he would be released if there were

no objection? that's the way you summarize the then law of
Florida*
MR. GEAREY s
QUESTION?

Right,
And then an alternative way of release is

even without a petition from anybody# if three members of the
hospital certify that he -- to a restoration of mental
competency.
MR. GEAREYs

Yes# that’s correct.

Now# this suit —
QUESTIONS
MR. GEAREYs
QUESTIONS

Then I take it — if you will —
Yes, sir?
Then I take it the issue of dangerousness

would not be involved in that# except as it might bear
indirectly on# and collaterally on# whether he had recovered,
MR, GEAREYs
QUESTIONS

That’s correct.
If he showed that he was not dangerous#

that wouldn't be enough to bring about his release?

16

MR. GEAREY;

I don't believe ifc would have been,

under that procedure.
QUESTIONi
MR, GEAREY;

Yes.
If it had been shown at that time,

under the *57 statute, that he was still in need of treatment,
with or without dangerousness, I believe he may have still
been retained at the hospital.
Florida law has drastically changed since the '57
procedure, and I will mention briefly later that under our
new law no patient is really kept more than six months
without a repeat hearing, and that we do recognize now a
statutory right to treatment.
QUESTION;

Is that automatic?

That is, without

any initiation on his part for that hearing?
MR. GEAREYs

That's correct.

After six months,

every patient is reviewed.
QUESTION;
MR. GEAREY s
QUESTION;
MR. GEAREY;

And where is that hearing?
Pardon?
Where is that hearing?
That's conducted at the hospital

before a hearing examiner, and at that point, unless ifc can
be shown that he's in need of further in-institution treatment,
he must be released, either to a community program or
released entirely.
QUESTION;

And if he's not released, is that

17
determination subject to judicial review?
MR. GEAREY;

Yes, sir, it would be. And, in addition,

he would again be reviev/ed periodically.

It's a periodic

process, with regular review.
QUESTION:

I see.

QUESTIONS

The hearing officer is a neutral officer

from the outside, is he?
MR. GEAREY;
QUESTIONS

Yes, sir, he is.
Something like the hearing examiners in

the federal system?
MR. GEAREYs

Yes.

At this present time we have one

hearing examiner who handles this particular institution»
He is employed by the State, but —
QUESTION*

He's not part of the hospital staff?

MR. GEAREY:
QUESTION;

Oh, no.

No.

Not at all.

To whom does he report?

MR. GEAREY;

He reports to — it's related to the

Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services, that supervises
the hospital.
process.

But it has proven to be very much of an adversary

The hearing examiner has shown himself to be quite

independent of the State.
Now, this suit was instituted somewhat before Hr,
Donaldson was released.

It originally sought release and

damages for his confinement, allegedly without treatment.
After his release, the action was converted to a

18

civil rights suit, eventually seeking damages from several
physicians who had treated him, or the ambisuperintendents
of the hospital.
The case went to trial, and the jury returned a
verdict of $38,000 against two of the physicians;

Dr.

O’Connor and Dr. Gumanis,
The Acourt of Appeals affirmed, and the petition
for writ of certiorari was brought to this Court and granted.
Now, on the constitutional right to treatment, which
is our first issue, we want —- the State of Florida wants to
make it clear that we agree that persons involuntarily civilly
committed to State mental institutions have a right to be
treated.

In Florida this is handled by statute.
However, we are concerned with the theory of a

constitutional right. There is no expressed constitutional
right to treatment, as such.

Ne recognize that if there is

one, it should flow from the due process clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment.
Florida would not willingly transform hospitals into
jails.
The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held
that there is indeed a constitutional right to treatment
flowing from the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,
The Court said that, and really nothing more.
There are no guidelines to guide the federal

19

judiciary in the enforcement of this right.

And this is where

we feel the important problem comes, and this is where the
idea breaks down.
We accept and we agree with this Court’s statement
in Jackson vs. Indiana, that the nature and duration of
confinement must bear some reasonable relationship to the
purpose for which the person is committed.
Now9 our problem with the constitutional right to
treatment is what is treatment and how do we measure it?
Mr. Donaldson was committed for treatment.

It was

the State’s position throughout this that he received such
treatment as was available, and to which he would submit.
However, we do quarrel with the ruling of the Fifth
Circuit, for what we consider to be important issues?
examination of due process inquires more than looking at the
quality and quantity of treatment? you first have to examine
the due process received in the commitment procedures, which
we've just briefly outlined here.
And then you have to get to the important step of
judging the quality and quantity of the treatment.

And thus

far we have a lack of meaningful guidelines to enforce this
right? a right incapable of enforcement, to us, cannot truly
be a right.
From 1957 to 1971, there were no judicial statements
that a constitutional right to treatment existed.

And there

20
xtfere certainly no guidelines to measure that right-

And

there are none now.
We seriously question whether the federal judiciary
is adequately equipped, without more in the way of guidelines,
to sit down and examine a patient's treatment program and
adequately pick and choose among dozens of treatment
therapies and program plans.
Quite seriously, the State of Florida is —*
QUESTION;

As far as patients in the State of

Florida are concerned, are there now guidelines, in your
view, in the Florida statute, in the new statute?
MR. GEAREYs

Under the review in the new statute,

the hearing examiner examines to the extent of whether the
treatment being received is reasonably designed to accomplish
the purpose.
He doesn't get into the specifics that were implied
in this case.
received.

It's a general review of the treatment being

If he finds that no treatment is being received,

the patient is no longer hospitalized, certainly,
QUESTION; But if the findings of the hearing examiner
is adverse to the patient, he may then go to the Florida
courts?
MR« GEAREY;
QUESTION;
MR, GEAREY;

The patient?
Yes.
Yes, sir.

21

QUESTION:

On appeal.

He may ask for a review of the

hearing examiner's determination; is that correct?
MR» GEAREY:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, it is.

How, the hearing examiner examines the treatment
to the extent that whether the physicians have made a
permissible decision in their treatment plans, he does not get
to the specifics.
And now we're haunted by the specter of federal
courts ordering a particular plan,
Now, as we stated in our brief,, there have been
cases that have been brought in the federal courts, criminal
cases, where the judge has found a man to be possibly unfit
to stand trial for reasons of insanity.

He would have the

man examined by two eminent and qualified psychiatrists, who
would indeed agree this man should not stand trial at this
time, he needs care and treatment.
The judge would then say, What treatment should he
have?
One eminent psychiatrist would say, Well, he should
be treated in a more physical way, a more medicinial way with
drugs, various forms of medicinal therapy.
The other would say, No, no, he should be treated in
a more psychiatric, psychological approach, without the drugs
and medicinal therapies.
QUESTION:

I can see why you can't really limit

22

your discussion of the case to the particular facts before us,
there are obviously broader issues involved? but in a case
like you mention, that man could reasonably be found dangerous,
I would think.
MR. GEAREY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
And therefore really not within the ambit

of the Fifth Circuit's opinion in -this case,
MR, GEAREY: Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, no, a
criminal defendant would not be within the ambit of the Fifth
Circuit's decision.

But I think that's very -*• the problem

of the judge is very analogous, where he's presented with two
psychiatrists who disagree on what the proposed treatment
program should be, to insure that the man receives the
treatment he deserves.
Now, this is what bothers us:

Are we going to

have the federal judiciary saying, Yes, there is a right to
treatment, but not giving us the guidelines to enforce it.
Now,
QUESTION: But, of course, the Florida -- Florida
has apparently elected to say that a man who is competent,
at least by this jury's definition, and not dangerous to
himself and not dangerous to others, can, nonetheless, be
virtually totally deprived of his liberty? and the
expectation, I suppose, is that what he gets in return is
some form of treatment.

23

Does it seem fair to you that the State should
entirely renege on its side of the thing?
MR. GEAREY:

Mo, sir, it doesn't, and we do believe

that we are offering the treatment that we do indeed promise.
Now, the burning issue in this, as far as the
guidelines, is that at the time of Mr, Donaldson's hospitalisa­
tion there were no guidelines, there was no right? and yet in
1971 the right was enforced retroactively back to 1957, and
resulted in personal liability.
Dr, O'Connor had before him a man judicially
committed.

His decision to release Mr. Donaldson is a quasi-

judicial decision.
Now, we've skipped to the liability question here,
but we don't believe that under those circumstances Dr. O’Connor
should have been held liable for making that decision.
QUESTION;

One could reach that result quite apart

from the existence of a right to treatment or not.

One could

hold there was a right to treatment and still, because of some
application of a privilege doctrine, say that this particular
defendant shouldn't have been liable here, I suppose.
MR. GEAREY;

Certainly.

Certainly.

Our point is that as far as the right to treatment
goes, that point -- to the State of Florida, not Dr. O'Connor
— is moot prospectively.

If there is going to be a constitu­

tional right to treatment, though, the States -- and this is a

24

broad issue among many States

need some sort of guidelines

Without those guidelines, we deny the existence of the right,
as unenforcible»
QUESTION:

Well, as you representing the State

here, or the hospital, or Dr. O'Connor?

Who are you

representing?
MR. GEAREY:

Well, Mr. Justice White, I represent,

in a way, both the State and Dr. O'Connor.
QUESTION: Well, does Dr, O'Connor have separate
counsel?
MR. GEAREY:
QUESTION:

No, sir, he does not.
Is the State paying the bill for him?

MR. GEAREY:

We're paying the bill for his

representation, however,
QUESTION:
MR. GEAREY:

How about the damages?
No, there's no provision under Florida

law, at that time, for the payment of damages.

These are

personal damages, under the Civil Rights Act.
QUESTION:

Did he have separate representation at

the trial?
MR. GEAREY:

No, he did not.

He was represented by

State counsel.
We represent Dr, O'Connor, and in his capacity as
a former State employee.
QUESTION:

But you —■ I haven't seen anything in

25
your brief or haven't heard anything here as to whether,, in
this specific trial, Dr, O'Connor was properly charged with
damages, even conceding some constitutional right for treatment.
For example, have you preserved any objections to
the instructions the trial court gave?
Other’than perhaps some blanket objection to an
assertion that there’s a constitutional right to damages?
MR, GEAREY:
instructions.

Yes, objections were made to the

One, in particular, that troubles this

QUESTION:

Well, I ask you if you preserved it?

MR. GEAREY:

Yes, we have.

I believe we have.

QUESTION: Well, where is it in your -- where is it
in your petition for certiorari or in your brief?
MR. GEAREY:

Oh, I think it’s implied in there that

that’s what we’re arguing about, is the way this case liras
presented to the jury by the District Court,
A good-faith instruction was given that said good
faith is a defense? but it is not a defense.
QUESTION: Well, what about the definition of the
constitutional right to treatment that was given to the jury?
MR. GEAREY:

Well, that’s the point we’ve argued

about, through the Fifth Circuit to this Court.
QUESTION:

Well, you’ve argued about whether there

is one, but how about;
it consist?

if there is one, what ~ of what should

26

MR. GEAREY:

Well, that’s a point that we haven't

raised, as to what it should consist of.
QUESTIO?!:

Well, that may very well — that may -~

if the Fifth Circuit or the District Court was wrong in
defining it, it might -- Dr. O'Connor might not have to pay
damages.
MR. GEAREYs

That's correct.

Now, we don't know how it should be defined, and
that's what —
QUESTIO?!x Well, you must have some idea.
MR. GEAREY:
QUESTION;

Well, —
That's what this case is all about.

MR. GEAREY:

Yes, sir, we do.

We feel that the

courts have given the States due process guidelines in areas
such as parole revocation, criminal trials; and this is
something similar.

When the right is announced, guidelines

should be announced at that time, in order to aid the States
in the enforcement of the right.
We believe that, as the Fifth Circuit —
QUESTION; Well, that's sensible,

I don't blame

the State for being interested in futuro, but Dr. O'Connor
has a particular problem here,

He's got a — it's this

lawsuit, I would suppose, that interests him as much as any,
and both of them are stuck with some damages.
MR. GEAREY;

Yes, sir

27

QUESTION:

I suppose you would argue tills case,

and whether the award of damages was proper in this case*
MR. GEAREY:
certainly was not.

Well, we’ve argued that in this case it

It results in a retroactive application of

a brand new doctrine.
QUESTION: Well, can this kind of a case happen again
in Florida, if Florida enforces its statute?
MR, GEAREY:

I don’t believe it could.

No.

QUESTION: Did the trial judge here give an instrue»
tion in terms of the existence of the constitutional right, or
did he instruct the jury merely that there was a right, without
defining what kind of a right?
MR. GEAREY:

No, he gave an instruction, stating

that there was indeed a constitutional right.

And this is the

point that, to us, is basic, essential error.
QUESTION:

Well, just let me ask you:

Let's

assume for the moment there is one ~~ assume you lose on your
assertion that there is none.

Then do you agree that with this

instruction that the trial court gave? you’re instructed that
a person who is involtunarily civilly committed to a mental
hospital does have a constitutional right to receive such
treatment as weill give him a realistic opportunity to be cured,
or to improve his mental condition.
Nov/, that was the instruction.

Assume there is a

constitutional right. Do you agree with that version of it?

28
MR. GEAREYs

He would agree with that»

Rut our

disagreement is that in this case
QUESTIOlJs Well, you assume, then, that a State
violates its duty unless it offers treatment that will give
him a realistic opportunity to be cured or to improve his
mental condition?
MR. GEAREYs

The State violates its duty if it

doesn't give him such treatment as it has promised him, to
make him well.
The problem in this case# however# —
QUESTION; Does that assume that in every case there
is a realistic opportunity to be cured?
MR, GEAREYs
QUESTION:

Oh# no# no.

Not at all,

Isn't it limited to —

QUESTIONs Well, then, it —
QUESTION:
QUESTION?

equal cure?
That's the way it sounds, those

instructions,
MR, GEAREYs

It's limited to available cures, that

are available within the State system.

Certainly the State

should make available all cures .possible.
However# there are some illnesses which virtually
cannot be cured.

There are others which --

QUESTIONS Well, then, how can you agree with this
instruction?

29
HR. GEAREY:

Wei 1 , we don't agree with it in this

case»
We agree with it in the case where it has been shown
that a man has a disorder that can be reasonably cured by
therapy»
QUESTION:

Well* this particular case happens to be

the one in which this instruction was given»
MR. GEAREY;

Yes, sir.

Now, the problem with it in this case is: that
instruction assumes the existing -- the existence of the right
to treatment»

And our point is:

Yes, there may be a right to

treatment now, but in 1957 to '71, there v/as not.

And so it’s

wrong.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

I want to find out

if you agree with this version, this rendition of the right to
treatment, if there is one, as this trial court instructed the
jury,
MR» GEAREY:
QUESTION:
MR, GEAREY:

if there is one —»
Do you agree with that or not?
If there is one, prospectivelly I think

we could agree with that? yes, sir.
QUESTION:

Well, what about the case where -- where

you — in which, as you suggest, there might not be any
relatistic opportunity to be cured?
MR» GEAREY:

Well, that would raise a problem that

30

it's not considered by that instruction»
QUESTION: Well, do you — do you think this case
might be one of those or not?
MR» GEAREY:

I don't think that on the record we

could say there was no hope of curing Mr, Donaldson.

There

is some question, as far as his disease goes, as to whether
even a one-to-one doctor-patient relationship would have any
effect»

The outcome seems to be more a disorder of the

disease than the type or amount of treatment»
QUESTION: Well, if that's the case, what's the
justification for Florida's confining him, if he wasn't
dangerous to himself, wasn't dangerous to others, and was
competent?

If there's virtually no possibility of curing him»
MR, GEAREYs

Well, the justification originally

rested upon dangerousness.
QUESTION:

If he wasn't —

In this case —

MR. GEAREY: Excuse me?
QUESTION:

In this case it did originally rest upon

dangerousness?
MR. GEAREY s

There was a finding in the commitmenfc

papers that he was dangerous to himself and others»

There

was conflicting testimony at trial as to the opinion of the
psychiatrist as to whether he was indeed dangerous.
Now, in '65, the outside psychiatrist said, Yes,
he is dangerous.

Other doctors said, No, he isn't.

31

And of course that’s a matter for psychiatric
opinion.
Thank you.
QUESTION ;

Or in this case it was a matter for the

jury, wasn't it?
MR. GEAREY: Well, in this case, yes, sir.

The

psychiatric opinion was conflicting, and it went to the jury.
Apparently the jury resolved it in favor of Mr. Donaldson.
QUESTIONS

Not only apparently, they did, did they

not?
MR. GEAREYs
QUESTION?

I think we'd have to assume that, yes.
They had to do it, or they couldn't have

reached that verdict under these instructions.
MR. GEAREYs

No, they couldn't have.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

All right.

Mr. Ennis.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE J, ENNIS, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR, ENNIS;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
Petitioner's arguments largely ignore the narrow
due process theory under which this case was tried and sub­
mitted to the jury.
This case involves only the application in a civil
commitment context of the due process rule this Court applied

32

in Jackson vsIndiana, that the nature and duration of a
deprivation of liberty must bear a reasonable relation to
the purpose for that deprivation.
Specifically, under the instructions in this case,
Petitioner was not held liable, because he failed or was
unable to treat respondent.

He was held liable because he

failed and refused to release respondent, even though he knew
that respondent was confined expressly for the purpose of
receiving treatment, and knew that respondent was receiving
no treatment, and was receiving instead only the custodial
care he would have received in a prison.
QUESTION: What is your view as to whether the new
Florida statute would give to the patients all the protection
they need -- assuming first that it's enforced and applied,
not ignored?
MR. ENNIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that the

new Florida statute is, in many respects,more comprehensive
than the constitutional right we are urging in this case.
And I think properly so.
QUESTION:

Because it’s an automatic review every

six months; is that correct?
MR. ENNIS:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.
So that, at most, there is the oppor­

tunity to demonstrate capacity to be released, or the
propriety of release, with great frequency?

MR. ENNIS:
QUESTION:

That is correct

„

Your Honor.

When you say that it's more comprehensive,

I take it, then, you mean that it’s better than the undefined
constitutional right postulated by the Fifth Circuit?
MR. ENNIS:

Your Honor, let me address that point.

If there is a right to treatment, surely there must be
a right to something other than sham treatment.

Hospitals

could not simply chain patients to their beds and call that
treatment.
Therefore, I think that the Fifth Circuit was quite
correct, as a matter of law, in ruling that if there is a
right to treatment it necessarily follows that the treatment
provided must give a reasonable opportunity, as the Fifth
Circuit phrased it, to cure or improve the patient’s condition,
QUESTION;

Well now, you might say that at least

they ought to offer such treatment opportunities as are
reasonably available within the art,
MR. ENNIS:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION;

But, even though that might not give a

realistic opportunity to be cured, 1 take it there are some
conditions that aren't thought to be curable.
MR. ENNIS:

That may be, Your Honor,

Under the instructions in this case, however, this
case was limited to the case of a person who was not dangerous,
either to himself or others,

34

QUESTION:

Well, I understand that*

I understand

that,
MR. ENNIS:

~ and therefore, if it turned out that,

with the provision of whatever treatment could be provided,
his condition could not be improved, then the question would
arise, as Mr. Justice Rehnquist asked, ■—
QUESTION:
case like that.

The instructions didn't allow for any

Apparently the State didn't object to that,

those instructions, and apparently accepted this case as not
being one where treatment wouldn't have any chance at all.
MR. ENNIS:

That's correct, Your Honor.

They did

not contend, in this case, that treatment would be unavailing
if offered.
QUESTION:
MR. ENNIS:

Yes.
Now, let me continue to point out that

under the instructions in this particular case, —
QUESTION:

So that if you ran into a case like

that, perhaps this particular formulation of the right to
treatment might have to be modified?
MR. ENNIS:

That may be, Your Honor.

We try to stress in our brief that this is in fact
a very narrow case, in very narrow circumstances.

And those

other, perhaps more difficult, questions are not presently
before the Court.
I wish to point out also —

35

QUESTION;

So you're suggesting# I take it# that

this case should be narrowly decided?
MR. ENNIS;

Yes# Your Honor# we are.

QUESTION;

And that the Court should not try to

range far afield in these other# what you call difficult#
questions.
MR. ENNIS;

I think that’s correct# Your Honor.

In fact# I believe that what counsel for petitioner
is asking for is in effect an advisory opinion from the Court
to guide future cases.

I do not think that is required here.

I think —
QUESTION;

Well# if it has nothing to do with the

Florida statute# he really doesn't need it# does
MR. ENNIS;

he?

That's right# Your Honor; absolutely

right.
The Florida statute itself could give the content
or the nature of the right to treatment in future cases.
But, more than that# let me point this out# I
received only this morning a letter from the Solicitor General
of the United States confirming that the United States takes
the position that patients involuntarily confined do have a
right to receive a reasonable opportunity for cure or improve­
ment.

That is the language from the Fifth Circuit's decision

in Wyatt vs. Aderholt, which was recently decided,
QUESTION;

Do you think that comports with the

36
instruction given by the trial judge here?
HR. ENNIS:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

Absolutely.

That is the position of the United States.
It is also the position of all of the relevant
professional organizations.
QUESTION:

First, did the Solicitor General say a

constitutional right?
HR* ENNIS:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes, he does,

And did he take into account the language

of the charge that has to do with —* I’ve forgotten the
precise words? Hr. Justice White focused on then a few
moments ago — all treatment, not treatment that’s available,
’’You are instructed that a person xfho is involuntarily civilly
committed does have a constitutional right to receive such
treatment as will give him" -- as will give him

"a realistic

opportunity to be cured."
Now, does that take into account that instruction,
that there may be no treatment then known that will give a
realistic opportunity?
MR. ENNIS:
QUESTION:
I1R. ENNIS:

Yes, it does, Your Honor«
If that's so ~
First, let me ansxver your specific

question.

Nell, what's that got to do vrith this

Is it filed here?
MR. ENNIS::

Yes, it was, Your Honor* as I under-

stand it, submitted to the Clerk with the request that it be —
QUESTION:

What is it, an amicus?

MR. ENNIS::

It is, in effect, an amicus filed.

QUESTION:

Well, then, was it —

QUESTION:
QUESTION:
MR» ENNIS:

Yes, we have it.
— was there some request to file it?
No, Your Honor.

The point is this s

The United States is participating

as plaintiff or as amicus in many so-called right to treatment
cases.
QUESTION: Well, I know, but the Solicitor General
says that he's filing it, inasmuch as your brief characterizes
"the actions and position of the United States respecting
involuntarily confined mental patients by treatment, I believe
it appropriate to advise the Court more fully."
MR. ENNIS:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

That's right.

It's prompted by what you said in your

brief about the United States does.
MR. ENNIS::
QUESTION:
MR. ENNIS::

That's correct.
Yes.
Let me point out one fact that I think

is very important in this case.

33
The jury found that the petitioner continued to
confine respondent, even though he knew that respondent was
not dangerous to himself or to others, and even though he
knew that respondent was not receiving any treatment.
Host important, the jury found that petitioner
confined respondent even though he knew that continued
confinement under those circumstances was not lawful.
Because of that jury finding, it seems to us that
there is and can be no issue of retroactivity in this case.
The jury found as a fact that the petitioner knew that his
acts were unlawful,
QUESTION:

Well, that doesn’t

he knew, perhaps,

that they were unlawful under the statutory test then in
effect in Florida; it doesn't mean he knew that he was
depriving anybody of any federal rights,
HR. ENNIS:

Well, Your Honor, I think the answer

to that question can be found in Monroe vs. Pape, I believe,
where this Court indicated that under Section 1983, proof of
a specific intent to deprive a person of a constitutional
right is not required; all that is required is proof to
deprive a person of some liberty which in fact is an
unconstitutional deprivation of liberty.
QUESTION: Which in fact is a violation of federal
law, constitutional or statutory.
MR. ENNIS:

That’s right.

In Monroe

Pape,

39

this Court said that a man is held responsible for the
natural consequences of his acts,.
But in this case it's even easier than that»
Because in this case the jury went further and expressly
found that the acts of the petitioner were not only bad faith „
but actually amounted to malice and wanton and oppressive
conduct toward respondent,
QUESTION:

VJell, what instruction do you rely on

for your statement that the jury must have found that he knew
his acts were unlawful?
MR, ENNIS:

Your Honor, I believe that that

instruction is quoted at page 74 of our brief.
The judge instructed the jury that:
"If the jury should believe from a preponderance
of the evidence that the defendants reasonably believed in good
faith that detention of plaintiff was proper for the length
of time he was so confined then a verdict for defendants
should be entered even though the jury may find the detention
to have been unlawful,"
QUESTION:
MR, ENNIS:

Unh-hunh.
"However, mere good intentions which do

not give rise to a reasonable belief that detention is lawfully
required cannot justify plaintiff's confinement in the Florida
State Hospital."
Read together, that instruction authorized the jury

40

to return a verdict for the petitioner, if they believed
that the petitioner reasonably believed that respondent's
continued confinement was legally proper, even if it —*
QUESTION: But it doesn't say — the instruction
doesn’t say "legally proper", it just says "proper"; so it
doesn’t really draw the distinction that they believed in
good faith that it was lawful, but in fact it turned out not
to have been lawful®
Maybe that's not preserved by the — by objection®
MR® ENNIS:

Yes, sir,

I'm reading these two

instructions together, the first of which says "proper" and
the second of which, in elaboration, talks about"lawfully
required"
QUESTION:

And it also doesn't particularly

refer to any federal unlawfulness,
MR, ENNIS:
QUESTION:

No, it does not, Your Honor.

That’s —

We're dealing here with a 1983 action,

I take it.
MR. ENNIS:

Yes, Your Honor, and that is contained

in our brief at pages 39 and 40, the instructions -—
QUESTION:

Well, where is it in — yeah, where is

MR, ENNIS:

Pages 39 and 40 of respondent's brief

that?

contain the instructions relevant to that point.
There the judge instructed the jury that:

41
In order to prove his Civil Rights Act case under
Section 1983, the plaintiff had to prove# by a preponderance
of the evidence# that the petitioner confined plaintiff
against his vrill# knowing that he was not mentally ill or
dangerous, -QUESTION:
NR. ENNIS:

Yes?
-- or knowing that if mentally ill he

was not receiving treatment.
QUESTION:

Now# you wouldn't defend that instruction

standing by itself# would you?
MR. ENNIS:

I’m sorry# I don’t quite understand

your question, Your Honor.
QUESTION: Well# do you think that was the proper
instruction, standing by itself?
MR. ENNIS:

I think this is certainly a proper

instruction.
QUESTION: All right.

Here's what the jury could

have found — could have based liability on:

If the doctor

simply knew that the patient was mentally ill and that he. was
not receiving treatment.
MR. ENNIS:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, I think —
Now, you wouldn't — you wouldn't suggest

that that is the definition of the constitutional right to
treatment.

Let’s assume, for example, that he was dangerous.
MR. ENNIS:

Yes.

42

Under the instructions in this case, which are
later amplified by the judge, ~
QUESTIO?!: Well/ I asked you about this instruction
standing alone.

That is not an adequate instruction, is it?

MR. ENNIS:

I think this is — there is nothing

improper about this instruction.
QUESTION:

Well, there is in -- the jury could have

found simply, could have based liability simply on finding
that he was ill and not receiving treatment, without regard
to dangerousness, either to himself or others.
MR. ENNIS:

If that instruction were read alone,

you're correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. ENNIS:

Well, that's what I asked.
I'm sorry, I didn't understand your

question.
QUESTION: Well, where is it corrected?
MR. ENNIS:

It is not -— it is then corrected,

if you will look on the next page of respondent's brief, as
the court elaborates, -~
QUESTION:

What page?

MR. ENNIS:

Page 40 of respondent's brief.

The court goes on to say that;
"The purpose of involuntary hospitalization is
treatment and not mere custodial care or punishment if a
patient is not a danger to himself or others."

43

QUESTION; Right»
MR, ENNISs

And then says;

"Without such treatment

there is no justification from a constitutional standpoint for
continued confinement unless you should also find that the
plaintiff was dangerous either to himself or others,"
QUESTION;

Not*, you don’t — you don't defend that

prior instruction standing alone?
MR, ENNIS;

I think all the instructions certainly

have to be read together, Your Honor.

I found nothing

improper in the initial instruction, but I think as amplified
in the later instructions, it is quite clear that —
QUESTION; Well, for example, assuming then that a
patient is dangerous to himself or others, then what is your
position with respect to the constitutional right to treatment?
MR, ENNIS;

Your Honor, our position would be as

follows;
Although that question does not arise in this case —
QUESTION;
MR. ENNIS;

Because of the way he amplified his views,
That's correct.

That's correct,

Your Honor.
But our position would be as follows;
We would contend that all persons confined under non­
criminal standards and procedures, whether dangerous or not,
would have a constitutional right to receive that treatment
which would give them a reasonable opportunity to cure or

44
improve their mental condition»
QUESTION:
QUESTION:
MR» ENNIS:

You mean, if a man -If there is such then available?
That’s correct, Your Honor,

QUESTION:

Well, the —

QUESTION:

You mean that if somebody is found not

guilty of first-degree murder by reason of insanity, and that
he can petition for a federal habeas corpus and be released
if he can prove that he’s not receiving satisfactory treatment?
MR, ENNIS:
Your Honor,

No, we’re not talking about that case,

We're talking solely about strictly civil

confinement, which has no criminal or quasi-criminal over­
tones o
QUESTION:

So you don’t mean, then, that only

somebody who was committed through the criminal process, by
a criminal trial, is exempt from this requirement for
treatment, you would extend it to something with a quasi­
criminal overtone?
MR» ENNIS:

No, we would not. Your Honor, not at

this time.
QUESTION: Well, would you — well, but, your
underlying theory has to either embrace it or not embrace it,
I would think.
MR, ENNIS:

Well, the theory of this case is where

the purpose for confinement is not a criminal law purpose,

45

then the patient confined would have an opportunity for a
reasonable level of treatment.
How, I wish to point out, though, that although we
are not contending in this case that persons confined under
the criminal law would have a right to treatment, that, in
fact, question has been left expressly open by the United
States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in a case
called United States ex rel Schuster vs. Hero Id, where the
Second Circuit ruled that it may well be that even criminally
confined persons have a right to treatment, in that the
treatment might well promote their possibility of early
parole.
But that is certainly a much, much more difficult
question than the question raised by this case, or by other
civil cases,
QUESTION:

And when you talk about criminally

confined persons, you include a person v/ho is found not guilty
by reason of insanity, and committed as a result of that?
MR. ENNIS:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

But is it not true that in a good many

jurisdictions now, a verdict of the jury, not guilty by
reason of insanity, either by statute or by judicial decision,
must be followed by the traditional civil commitment pro­
ceeding in order to confine him?
MR. ENNIS:

Yes, Your Honor, that is certainly true.

46

QUESTIONs

Now, in that case, your statement of

your underlying theory would reach it, because his confinement
would have been pursuant, in those cases, to a civil
commitment proceeding which was triggered by a jury verdict
of not guilty by reason of insanity, when he was criminally
prosecuted»
MR. ENNIS:

Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.

I just want to say this:

that that kind of case

might well raise some very difficult issues of preventive
detention, for example, which this Court and other courts
have grappled with for decades.
We are not prepared at this time to argue those
other and more difficult cases.

I do not feel I have the

authority to concede away or to support a right to treatment
in those criminal law cases.
We really have only brought in this case the
narrowest possible case, and that is the case of a person
who is confined expressly for the purpose of treatment, who
had never been charged with any crime.
QUESTION:

Well, wasn't he found, in connection

with his commitment, found to be dangerous to himself or
others?
MR, ENNIS:

Your Honor, the commitment papers

are sketchy and inconsistent on that point.

It was not —■

QUESTION; Well, I read that in the brief somewhere,

47
and I just wondered what the truth of the matter was, since
they are not part of the record here.
MR. ENNISs
Your Honor:

Well, there was — I can say this,

there was no transcript of the trial, at the

initial coramitment proceeding.

Mr, Donaldson testified about

that trial, and that is in the record.

He testified that

though he asked to cross-examine the physicians who had
examined him, he was not permitted to do so and the physicians
did not testify.
lie held a very brief hearing, and was thereupon
committed.

There was no evidence in the commitment papers of

any dangerous act whatsoever.
However, the Florida commitment papers did have
boilerplate language, and one of them said the patient may be
a danger to himself or others.

However, another commitment

paper expressly said that he was confined to Florida State
Hospital because he was mentally ill and dangerous to himself
or others or in order to insure proper treatment.
So it may well be that he was confined not because
the committing judge thought he was dangerous, but simply to
insure proper treatment.
At any rate, that point was not litigated in this
case, because under the instructions —
QUESTION:
MR. ENNIS:

I thought it was agreed.
It was agreed — Your Honor, it was

40

litigated -~
QUESTION:

It was agreed that he was committed for

two reasons, that he was a danger to himself and to others.
There never v;as a dispute on that.
MR. ENNIS:

Your Honor, we never conceded that he

was dangerous at the time of commitment,
QUESTION:

Well, did you ever dispute it?

MR. ENNIS:

No, we didn't dispute it.

was not at issue in this trial.

It simply

Because in this trial the

petitioner expressly acknowledged that he had a duty upon
receiving a patient under a judicial commitment order to
make his own professionally independent determination, of
whether that patient continued to require confinement.
QUESTION:

Well, wasn’t all of the tests made to

find out whether or not he was a danger to others?
MR. ENNIS:
clear, Your Honor.

The tests on that point are absolutely
Respondent's expert witnesses examined

all of the tests that were given, all of the hospital record,
and they said that there was no evidence in the hospital
record that he was or ever would be a danger to himself or
others.

He had never injured himself or any other person.

He had always been self-employed, a taxpayer, never taken
welfare, and, furthermore, the test results of the psychological
tests, according to a psychologist x-/ho testified, —
QUESTION:

Well, how about this doctor from

49

Jacksonville?

Did he say that?

MR, ENNISs

No# Your Honor.

First of all# that

was not a doctor ~~
QUESTION:

I thought you said all of them did.

MR. ENNIS:

Let ms be clear.

QUESTION:

Please.

MR. ENNIS:

All of the employees at the staff of

Florida State Hospital# with the exception of petitioner#
said that in their opinion respondent was not dangerous,
His co~defendant testified at trial that respondent was not
dangerous.

The director of the Psychology Department at

Florida State Hospital testified that in his opinion respondent
was not dangerous,
QUESTION:

Well# all of this came about# about the

simple question I asked:

Didn't you agree that he was

committed for the two reasons?
MR. ENNIS:

No# Your Honor# we did not.

that he was committed for the purpose of treatment.

We admitted
We never

conceded that he was dangerous at the time of commitment.
But that issue was not raised or litigated in this trial.
Under the instructions in this case# the jury had
only to find that after his confinement there was no reasonable
basis for the petitioner to believe that respondent was
dangerous,
QUESTION: So it's not essential to your success here#

50
that you relitigate a finding of dangerousness that might have
been made in the 1957 proceeding?
MR, ENNIS:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor,
Well, could I ask, to be clear about

one thing:
I suppose, at the threshold of the case, you could
win your case, at least in one way, if you -- if it were held
that there was no, the State had no right to commit anybody
just for treatment, if he was not dangerous to himself or
others?
MR, ENNIS;
QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor,
How about that?

Have you taken any

position on that in this case?
MR. ENNIS:
footnote.

We do take a position on that in a

Our position is essentially that that is a

difficult question which this Court need not and probably
should not address itself to in this case.
However, —
QUESTION:

Well, it might avoid an awful lot

it might avoid an awful lot of lawsuits around in future
litigation about the definition of the right to treatment,
if there was ■— if the State couldn't confine people at all,
unless they were found to be dangerous.
MR. ENNIS:

That's right, Your Honor, and —

QUESTION:

In which event, there might not be any

51
right to treatment.
MR. ENNIS:
QUESTION:
MR. ENNIS:

Simply a right to liberty.
Yes.
That's right, Your Honor, we do take

the position in a footnote in our brief, that if the Court
reaches that question, it should rule that no person can be
subjected to lengthy or indeterminate involuntary hospifcaliza
tion unless that person is dangerous to himself or others,
regardless of whether adequate treatment is or is not
provided.
QUESTION: Did the Court of Appeals take a position
on that?
MR, ENNIS:

No, I don't think it —

QUESTION:

Was the issue ever raised in this case?

MR. ENNIS:

The issue was not specifically raised

in this case, Your Honor.
I might say that briefs have been filed by various
professional organizations, one of the briefs by several of
the relevant organizations, the American Psychological
Association, the American Orthopsychiatric Association, and
so forth, takes precisely that position; that no person
should be involuntarily confined solely for the purpose of
treatment, unless that person is also a danger to self or
others.
QUESTION:

In terms of proper approach to constitu-

52

fcional questions, what do you think v?e should do about that
issue, just leave it alone, or what?
*

HR» ENNIS 5

Your Honor, I think the appropriate

course for this Court to take on that issue in this case
would be either expressly to reserve that decision or to
indicate, as it has indicated in other cases, that if that
question were squarely presented to the Court, it would
probably rule as a matter of constitutional law that
involuntary confinement of non~dangerous persons is not
constitutionally justified.
QUESTION; Well, then, if we held that in this case,
we wouldn't reach these other *—
MR* ENNIS;

You wouldn't reach the right to

treatment issuQ at all, that’s correct, Your Honor,
QUESTION;

Well, — thank you.

HR. ENNIS;

Certainly the facts in this case are

clear, and the instructions are clear enough, that that
finding would be appropriate in the circumstances of this
case, even though it was not the specific basis for decision
be 1
QUESTION;

But you think the ~ you think the jury

had to have found that he was neither dangerous to himself
or others?
MR. ENNIS;
Honor,

Under these instructions, yes, Your

53
QUESTION:

Did the instructions of the trial court

give any indication to the jury that they were to examine
the entire fifteen years of confinement and consider whether
there was one situation prevailing in part of that time and
another at a different part?

That is, having in mind that

this man was a Christian Scientist, and that this record
shows beyond any dispute that he had categorically refused
certain treatments at certain times,

did it give the jury a

chance to treat that as a mitigating factor?
HR. ENNIS: Absolutely, Your Honor»

In fact, the

petitioner himself drafted and proposed an instruction
specifically designed to cover that point,,

And that

instruction was given»
The instruction advised the jury that if the jury
found that respondent did not receive any treatment or any
form of treatment because of his refusal or reluctance to have
that form of treatment, then the jury could not find liability
or award damages, based on that refusal.
QUESTION:

Well, do you think the verdict is

consistent with the undisputed evidence that he did consistently,
over a long period of time, refuse any treatment whatever?
MR, ENNIS:

Yes, it's quite consistent, Your Honor,

because, first of all, the verdict is rather modest, I think,
in this case for a fifteen-year deprivation of liberty»
But, second, I must respectfully advise the Court

54
that in fact there was evidence from which the jury could have
found that Mr. Donaldson did not ever actually refuse any
treatment? he did expressly say to the doctors, "I prefer not
to have shock treatment.”
But the doctor who was considering giving shock
treatment testified at trial that he did not actually intend
to give shock treatment, he only wanted to have that
possibility available should respondent become a violent or
disruptive patient.
That eventuality never occurred, and shock treatment
was never given.
Similarly with respect to medication,

1 think it's

in the Appendix, at page 52, the respondent testified fcnat
petitioner expressly told him that so long as he was not a
management problem, he would not have to take medication.
He never was a management problem, and therefore he
did not have to take medication.
However, when he came under the supervision of
another physician, that physician did urge upon respondent
that he take medication, and at that point respondent did
take medication, when it was, for the first time, actually
prescribed for him.
The physician tried the medication for a couple of
weeks and then took respondent off the medication upon the
physician's finding that the medication had absolutely no

55
effect, one way or the other.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Ennis, directing —> I've just been

thinking about a problem, not of the emotionally ill who are
— some of whom, at least, are presumptively curable, some of
whom are not; and with any of whom it's just a hope or
presumption — as contrasted with the mentally retarded, as a
result of a congenital, serious brain damage, for example.
MR. ENNIS;

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION;

Surely, the — would you quarrel with

a State's constitutional power to enact a law or to have a
program that would say we"re going to institutionalize these
people in order to take them out of the families of the
impoverished and others, to give them the best custodial care
we can, that is, decent and civilized care, but they're
untreatable and we're just going to keep them in an institution indefinitely,
MR, ENNIS;

Yes, Your Honor, I would quarrel with that,

And for the following reasons
Despite very widespread popular assumption to the
contrary, it is now quite clear that the mentally retarded,
even severely and profoundly retarded persons, even autistic
persons, Your Honor, —
QUESTION; Well, there are many varieties, but I
premised this on people who had congenital brain damage, —
MR. ENNIS;

Yes.

56

QUESTION!
MR. ENNIS:

— physical brain damage.
Yes , Your Honor, there is now widespread

professional consensus that even those persons are capable of
a great deal of growth and improvement, even persons with
IQ's below 19 —
QUESTION:

I know, I know some of those —

MR. ENNIS:

— can be taught to toilet themselves,

dress themselves.
QUESTION:
MR. ENNIS:

— I know some of these tilings, yes.
That question, of course, is not raised

in this case.
QUESTION: Well, it is, because, up until really
very recently, as the history of western civilisation goes,
that was the whole concept of what, to use an old-fashioned
phrase, but the phrase, the label indicates the theory,
that's what an insane asylum was for.

It was to, presumptively

these people in the then state of the art were not curable,
this was a permanent condition, or one of indefinite
duration, and the idea was, as you well know, to provide
decent custodial care and to relieve the families of the
economic, social and psychological damage that would follow
from the presence of those people in their families or
households.
And institutions were set up to provide that service,
and I wouldn't be surprised if in some States today the

57

commitment was not for treatment but the commitment was for
CU3 tody.
MR. ENNIS:
QUESTIONs
MR, ENNIS:

Your Honor , let me answer that ~~
So I think it is involved here.
Let me answer that question in a few

words.
QUESTION?

But you say a State cannot constitu”

tionally do that.
MR. ENNISs

Let me say two things.

First, we do not contend that the State cannot
constitutionally provide a custodial facility for voluntary
patients.

The only point at issue in this case is whether a

person can be involuntarily subjected to custodial care.
QUESTION:

Well, by definition these people are

lacking in competence to do anything voluntarily for themselves.
We're talking about the members of their family, their fathers,
their mothers, or —
MR. ENNIS:

That's right.

I just

QUESTIONs And that’s involuntary, by your definition?
MR, ENNIS:
QUESTION s
MR. ENNIS:

That's correct, Your Honor.
Yes.
I would just close by pointing out that

there is a book cited in our brief, "The Discovery of the
Asylum" by Professor David Rothman, which points out that
actually asylums were first created in this country not for

58

the purpose of providing custodial care, but rather to treat
and cure patients.

That was the origin of the asylum in

America.
Let me close, Your Honor, by saying that we have
tried to show this is a narrow case and,properly understood,
does not raise any novel rights.

It involves only the

t

right to be free from external restraint in all but the most
compelling of circumstances,,

we do not believe those

circumstances exist in this case, and the judgment should be
affirmed.
QUESTION;

Mr. Ennis, before you sit down, I want

to return to a question I asked the Attorney General.

Was

any effort made by respondent to obtain his release under,
what is it, Chapter 394 of the Florida law?
MR. ENNIS:

Yes, Your Honor.

Let me answer that question by saying the following
The petitioner has referred to various habeas
corpus and other types of proceedings brought by respondent.
I have examined all of the records of those proceedings I
can find, and I can state to the Court that all of those
proceedings were dismissed on procedural, jurisdictional,
and other non-constitutional grounds, not relevant to the
issues before this Court.
There was testimony at trial by respondent that he
did in fact attempt to use every conceivable statutory remedy

59

he could use to effect his release, but he never once got a
hearing.
And the reason, in fact, he did not get a hearing is
that petitioner opposed those hearings by supplying affidavits
to the courts,stating that his confinement was proper»
QUESTIONS
MR. ENNIS:

And was upheld?
Without a hearing, Your Honor.

No

hearing was ~~
QUESTION:

Well, it was upheld, and that didn't —

sometimes you say on a procedural ground, or non-merit ground,
but —
MR. ENNIS;

Well, let me -- since the question has

been raised again, let me read to you briefly, Your Honor,
one such decision.
QUESTION:
MR. ENNIS:

Is this habeas corpus or —
On a habeas corpus decision.

This is the entire decision in one of those cases
by a county judge, which said:
"Certainly the State Hospital authorities have no
desire nor reason to detain you in the hospital any longer
than your condition requires.

In the event your condition

is such as to justify it, the medical staff will give you a
hearing."
That was a letter to respondent from the county
judge.

That assumed that petitioner was acting in good faith.

60
As it would ba reasonable and responsible for a judge to
assume.

But the jury found in this case that in fact that
judicial assumption v?as unwarranted.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you» Mr, Ennis.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon» at 11:17 o'clock, a„m., the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.]
