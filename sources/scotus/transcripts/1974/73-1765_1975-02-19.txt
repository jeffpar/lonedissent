Tie will hear arguments

Mr, Pfeffer, you nay proceed whenever you're ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEO PFEFFER, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR, PFEFFER:

Mr, Chief Justice, nay it please the

Court:
This case is a challenge to three statutes enacted
by the State of Pennsylvania in 1972,
This Court, in 1971, in the case of Lemor. jv,
Kurtzman, had previously declared, unconstitutional a statute
providing for the practice of secular services by non-public
schools-? and the Court held that that violated the. Establish­
ment Clause,
Thereafter, the district court in the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania held unconstitutional another statute
which provided for reimbursement for tuition paid by parents
for their children attending non-public schools,

That was

declared unconstitutional as a violation of the Establishment
Clause,
And while that case was pending before this Court,
on an appeal to this Court, the Pennsylvania Legislature
enacted a package of throe statutes:
Now, Act 204

Acts 194, 195 and 204,

an be disposed of very briefly.

It

4
increased the amount which had originally been appropriated
for the tuition grants payment,» although the law had already
been declared unconstitutional by the Eastern District Court,
and whether that case is now moot, that part of our case is
now moot because this Court confirmed the District Court;
so that part of the complaint which we alleged is now moot»
But before this Court is the constitutionality of
Acts 194 and 195.
Briefly, Act 194 provides for financing of tax-raised
funds, or what are called auxiliary services, in non-public
schools.
I don't want to spend time reading the definition,
it's contained in the — certain jurisdictions contained in
the Appendix, also contained on page 4 of our brief.
Act 195 has three separata provisions, all providing
for tax-support of services in non-public schools.

One

provision provides for textbooks, another for instructional
materials, and a third for instructional equipment.
The definitions of each are in our brief.
Now, the amounts appropriated in 1972 was $31 million,
and then the following year it was increased to $35 million
per year, which is where it is now subject to further increases
which we may assume will take place.
The District Court, by a vote of two-to-one, held
— upheld the constitutionality of the auxiliary services

5
provisions unanimously# although Judge Higginbotham was quite
reluctant# obviously reluctant to go along# but he did# for
reasons I frankly am not able to understand# upheld the
constitutionality of the textbook provision»

On the

instructional materials# again we had a two-to-one split#
with Judge Higginbotham dissenting*

On the instructional

equipment# we have sort of a compromise»
Part of the statute was declared unconstitutional
unanimously# and part of it was declared constitutional in
respect to, and this Court read this into the statute# "to
such instructional equipment which from its nature cannot be
readily diverted to religious purposes and is particularly
designed or designated for secular educational purposes
provided for in the statute and its duly-promulgated guides
for the administration of such statute,"
Now# as far as the appellants are concerned# there
are no contested-fact situation in this case.

We believe the

statute# on the basis of decisions of this Court# is
unconstitutional on its face.
We would like to put this case in proper perspective.
We do not challenge the right of — we do not
challenge the right of pupils in non-public schools to obtain
these services# all of them; we challenge the right to obtain
these services as part of the over-all program of religious
education in religious schools.

6

,

Now we concede, we recognise that it is more con­
venient to bring the services to the children than to have the
children come to the public schools ~~ we’re not talking about
requiring children to enroll in public schools for the complete
program — but to come to the. public schools for these
additional services and benefitsu
Now, we recognize that it’s more convenient the other
way.
But it's our contention that the values protected
by the religion clauses of the First JVinendmenfc, which this
Court spelled out and emphasized again in Wisconsin v. Yoder,
and again in the Nyquiet case last year or the year before,
that these values are so doninant in our democratic concept
and hierarchy

values, that the inevitable, somewhat — were

an inconvenient method of delivering these services through
requiring the children to come to the religious schools, as
they do in released time practices, which this Court upheld in
1952.
New, that is undoubtedly less convenient than the
other way, but the high estate in which both the free exercise
and the Establishment Clause, as the Court has painted out,
which has held in our hierarchy of values, requires this somewha
modest sacrifice.
Now, there’s another fact which we deem of vital
importance, and w® deem it may be the heart of this case.

Mow , this case does not come to this Court, this
la

, which faced the natura of -the educational system,
in Pennsylvania in relationship with the non-public to the
public schools and the religious schools, among the non-public
schools, was before this Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman and then
again in Sloan v. Lemon.
Nov;, it is un con tested -- this was uncontested —
that in administering the law, and we have the Appendix
citation, page 047 or 48, the Commissioner of — who
had the obligation to enforce

has

will agree that in administer­

ing the law there are certain eligible requirements, requiring
the curriculum of the school and so on.
But not included in these eligible requirements and
not deemed to be disabling is the fact, for example, that the
schools restrict admissions on the basis of religion, or
that the schools require all students to participate in
religious instruction as condition for their continuance in
the school.
Or that the schools serve a major religious purpose
in their functions.
Now, the State

<£

Pennsylvania takes the posi tr on

that these are not disabling factors, that, notwithstanding
these facts, the schools and the students attending those
schools are entitled to the full benefits of the Act.
Now, there's one constitutional provision, there's

G
one which# to me# is as close ro a categorical imperative in
constitutional law as we can get.
I submit that whether you look at it from the First.
Amendment,, the Fifth# the Ninth# or the Fourteenth# it is
simply not within the concept of our constitutional concepts#
of

our constitutional dictations# that a service which is

financed with funds raised to compulsory taxation of all
citizens#from such service any citizen can be barred because
of his religion or because of his race.
This is as close to a categorical imperative I can
see.
And only second to that is that such a school can
condition — can condition participation in the benefits
universally financed upon the students participating in
religious services or religious sectarian instructions.
This is# if Your Honors please# to me the heart of
the case.

And, as I say# it is as close as I can see to a

categorical imperative.
The Court pointed that out in Norwood v» Harrison ,
in which it held that textbooks# through one of the provisions
of our law and one of Act 195. could not be appropriate#
could not be sent to private schools which discriminate on
the basis of race.
And in Norwood

Harrison# the Court pointed out

to the dissenting — or partly dissenting# part3.y concurring

D
opinion of Hr. Jus tics White in the Lemon v« Kurtaman case,
that if a school discriminates or restricts admissions either
on race or religion, or requires participation in sectarian
instruction for students, that the services such as textbooks
or other services, and the Norwood case dealt with textbooks,
could not be made available in that school.
So that it is our opinion, it is our view, that on
the basis of that alone, of that principle, the constitution'»
ality of this statute cannot be held as interpreted in the
previous cases of Lemon v. Kurtzraan and Sloan v. Lemon.
Now, between the time that the district court
handed down its decision in our case and the time, the
present time, this Court affirmed the decision of the district
court from the Third Circuit, in New Jersey, in the case of
Harburger v._ PublicJPunds for Public Schools.

And the Supreme

Court has since then affirmed, per curiam, that decision.
Now, the statute in that case, in the Marburger
case, as far as I can read it, is -- there are some differences
in detail, which I believe are secondary

as far as the

constitutional issue was concerned, presented in this case,
I do not recognise, I do not see any significant constitutional
difference between the statute in New Jersey and the statute
in Pennsylvania.

They came out of the same pattern, the

language is in most of these statutes, the language is
identical, the words, the setup is identical.

They are

10
really# for all practical purposes# as far as I can see# they
are identical statutes.
QUESTION:

Does the Marburger case involve all

three —
MR. PFEFFER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

■—« auxiliary services and instructional

materials and —
MR. PFEFFER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

~~ textbooks?

MR. PFEFFER:
involved in Marburger.

Everything within this statute was
And textbooks# too.

They were some­

what slightly different in the way the textbooks were provided
for# but I don’t believe it's constitutional significant,
QUESTION:

Well# what were the differences?

MR. PFEFFER:

Well# 'the basic difference was# in the

Marburger case# that the cost# the money for the textbooks was
given instead of the textbooks themselves.
are loaned.

Here the textbooks

But basically the same principle# they still

cams out
QUESTION: The money was given# wasn’t it?
MR. PFEFFER:

Yes, the money for -— to reimburse

the cost of the textbooks.
QUESTION;

And how about auxiliary services?

MR. PFEFFER:
QUESTION:

No# that was similar to this.

And how about instructional materials?

11
MR. PFEFFER:
QUESTIONS

Similar or the same?

MR. PFEFFER;
identical.

Similar to this.

Similar.

Well, I almost think

As a matter of fact, 1 think it’s almost word for

word; identical.
They obviously came out of the same pattern, the
same mold.

I don't think there’s any basic difference.
QUESTION;

I take it, Mr. Pfeffer, that you are

going to treat each of these categories —
MR. PFEFFER:
QUESTION:

—- separately at some point,

MR. PFEFFER;
QUESTION;

Yes.

Yes, I'm going to do that right now.

Speaking for myself, that would be very

helpful.
MR. PFEFFER:

Yes.

Well, now I want to — I say

that, I will do that. Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, but I
not© that in Marburqer it was not.

In Marburger, the District

Court and this Court's affirmance held the entire statute
uncons titutional.
Now, but for convenience purposes

and I also

submit that these statutes were enacted as a package# with the
clear intent and purpose of recouping the money which had been
denied by this Court in the other decisions.
Now, let us take the auxiliary services provision
first.

12
First, I suggest that, as far as 1 read the First
Amendment, there is no constitutional distinction between
educational services, whether called auxiliary or non-auxiliary,
auxiliarj' services is a new term, and it didn't exist previously,
until just very, very recently.
But making «— calling auxiliary services -- calling
educational services auxiliary services, they are still
educational services.
Now, for —
QUESTION*

I suppose you would agree, Mr. Pfeffer,

that at the time the First Amendment was drafted, there were
no services of the kind we now embrace in these areas.
MR* PFEFFER:

I don't, Mr, Chief Justice, because

the regulations —*
QUESTION; Well, put it another way:

You didn't

have all the range of services provided «—
MR. PFEFFER:
QUESTION:

No, but the —

— that you have today*

MR# PFEFFER:

-- bulk, the bulk you do have*

Because the bulk — the regulations which have been adopted by
the State of Pennsylvania, which I have in try footnote 3 on
page 15 of my brief, our brief, indicates that services,
auxiliary services are defined as to include those services
necessary to assist a student to perform at the grade level
of his age said potential.

13
What does that mean?
That means that if a pupil is below the grade level#
yea have to help him get to the grade level.»
it?

How do you do

You give him more intensive education# after hours# or

more intensive —* or what is often dona# smaller class with
more teachers.

But it's simply educational services.

same type was involved in Lemon

1%

The

Kurtzman and Lemon v.

Sloan# the Nyguist case# and every case that has come to this
Court.
There is no school in the country which doesn’t have
students who are below grade level# except in Utopia# perhaps#
or a school limited to geniuses.

And it’s the job of the

teacher to take additional time to —- with a pupil below
grade level# in some cases it would be above grade level and
you will not need additional help. And to take time with
them.
Now# that existed in 1787 as it does today# in
every school.

But calling it auxiliary services --

QUESTION:

In 1787# of course# the First Amendment

—- you said a minute ago the way you read the First Amendment#
there is certainly nothing in .the First Amendment that would
suggest that it has anything to do with this case.
"Congress shall make no law".

It begins#

This doesn’t involve any tiling

that Congress has done.
MR. PFEFFER;

Well# but# Your Honor# the ~~ as this

14
Court has held, way back as far as Kaplan v. Connecticut -QUESTION:

Yes, but not back in 1787 it didn*t.

MR* PPEPPER:

Well, there was no Fourteenth

Amendment in 1787»
QUESTION: Exactly.
MR» PFEFPERs

Well, there was no Fourteenth Amendment

and there was no — there were practically no public schools
either.

But the principles laid down in 1787 are certainly

broad enough to encompass everything which this Court, has
done in interpreting the First Amendment is applicable to our
educational system.
Now, it is our contention that considered within the
framework of the decisions of this Court, in 1971, Lemon v.
Kurt.groan, Earley v« DiCemso, and in 1973, Levitt y. Committee
for Public Education and

Committee for Public Education v.

Nyquist, that this auxiliary services provision cannot stand»
What this basically does is to make a partnership of
Church and State, it involves that entanglement of Church and
State, which this Court, beginning with the Walz case, held
was forbidden by the Establishment Clause»

It requires the

State to take part of the educational burden in the schools,
the Church the other part, that work together, the teachers
come in, they go out, they substitute supervision, it is a
administrative entanglement, it is a entanglement in the
sense which the Court in all these cases has emphasized, in

15
order to assure that the Establishment Clause is not violated
by the use of instruction to propagate religious values,
there must be surveillance.

And the Court said, it said it

as far back as Lemon v. Kurtzman and repeated it in ITyguist
and Lemon v, Sloan, the we do not have to find that in any
particular school **- there was no fact, there was no trial of
facts in the other two Pennsylvania cases, the two Lemon
cases — we do not have to find that this teacher or that
teacher did actually use her or his position to advance
religious values»
The constitutional clause requires the State to
take all measures to prevent that friction, that possibility,
that temptation.

And we submit that the State of Pennsylvania

has not done that.
The State of Pennsylvania, and it indicated on the
hearing, takes the position that you can trust the teacher»
Well, I have no suspicion of any particular teacher, but
that's not what the Amendment requires, as far as this Court
is concerned.
The Amendment requires that there be no opportunity,
there be no temptation, there be no conflict, possibility of
conflict, or raisunderstending. And the only way, that's why
the Court in every case since Allen in .1968, in every case
which reached this Court involving aid to religious schools
are at the elementary and secondary level, I'm not talking

16
abo’cit the college level; on elementary and secondary level,
no matter what the pattern, whether it's tuition grants or
secular services or supplementary salaries to teachers or
tax credits or tax benefits, or maintenance or repair, every
one of the patterns, the Court said that you are faced with
this insoluble dilemmas
religious purposes, to

either the benefit is used for
attach religion, which is forbidden!

or, to prevent that, the school is subject to that surveillance
which itself violates the Establishment Clause because it
entails excessive entanglement.,
Not'/, so much for auxiliary services.
Mow I go to the textbooks.
Now, the keystone of the textbook provision on which
the court below, although not the court in Marburger, the
court below upheld the textbook provision unanimously, was
the Board of Education v. Allen, the decision of tit is Court ■—
QUE3TX0N:

Hr. Pfeffer, —

MR. PPEFFERs
QUESTIONi

Yes?
— are you asking that we overrule Allen?

MR. PFEFFERs

I ask that this Court overrule Allen,
—«w-'S.-crr

but, as 1 point out in my brief, it can reach the same
decision without overruling it.
It?s rny

position, it’s our position that Allen was

not consistent with what this Court has said before, and
certainly not consistent with, what this Court has held after it.

17
It stands alone, by itself.

That the premises upon which it

is based have been shaken by every case in which the issue
was raised, including the Norwood case, which, while it
involved racial discriminafci.on, basically is indistinguishable.,
As far as the Fourteenth Amendment is concerned, discrimination
on religion is certainly no more preferable than discrimination
on race in respect to institutions ~~
QUESTION:

Do the religion clauses deal with any

aspect of discrimination?
MR. PFEFFER: Well, as interpreted by this Court,
by all means.

This Court has, as I said, in Norwood v.

Harrison, the Court pointed out that even — even fir. Justice
White, in his dissent —QUESTION:
did it?

That didn't rest on the First Amendment,

In Norwood?
MR. PFEFFER:

Amendment case.

Well, Norwood was a Fourteenth

But the Court noted Mr. Justice White’s

opinion in the First Amendment cases, that the First
Amendment, or the Fourteenth Amendment, it doesn't matter
which, I mean, it's the «First, Fifth ar Fourteenth, or all of
them combined, forbids the use of public funds to provide
services from which persons are excluded, or put in a lower
category of admittance.
Either becqause of race- \

.

or religion, both of

them are stated; both of them are stated in Norwood v.

18
Harrison.
QUESTION:

Well, do you think that the First Amend­

ment mandated the same sort of State hostility towards religi­
ous education as the Fourteenth Amendment mandates towards
segregated «— education segregated by race?
MR. PFEFFER:

Well, Mr. Justice Relinquish, the

answer is not hostility.

That is unfortunate, an unfortunate

term, because the Court, this Court has had the task, ever
since it started with the first case in which it declared
unconstitutional a State statute involving — a State
practice involving released time in the public schools.
Each time the Court has found it necessary to repeat
•that the barriers of the First Amendment ware not motivated
by any hostility to religion or religious education.

But a

belief -~
QUESTION:

Yes, but what Ifm asking you is:

conceding that, isn't the barrier of the Fourteenth Amendment
in fact motivated by hostility towards public education
segregated by race?
MR. PFEFFER:

Well, they’re talking

it's motivated

by that, because it involves State involvement, not by private
education? the Fourteenth Amendment doesn’t prevent private
schools from segregating by race.
Now, why does it — why does it involve -- why does
the Fourteenth Amendment indicate hostility?

Because it. is

19

the State involvement in that type of discrimination which
the Constitution is hostile to.
And it*s our position that there is certainly ‘ no
hostility to religious education, any more than it’s hostility
to segregated, racially segregated, as far as the
Constitution is concerned? what the Constitution is hostile
to is State or governmental involvement in discrimination
among .its own people on the basis of their religion. That
is the basis of the Establishment Clause and the Fourteenth
Amendment.
And it’s irrelevant, it’s irrelevant whether the
discrimination be based upon religion or based upon race.
It just is not permissible discrimination for — as far as
government is concerned.
Mow, we urge — as I say, we urge that Allen be
reconsidered, but it’s not necessary, if the Court is not
prepared to reconsider Alien.

We believe that Allen is

completely distinguishable, and we pointed out in our brief
the “**
QUESTION: Well, how is it, on textbooks?
MR, PFEFPER:

On textbooks, how —> well, in the

first place, the element of discrimination does not appear in
Alien, which does appear here.

The element of the fact that

there is discrimination in admissions, and that the State of
Pennsylvania agrees that you can give textbooks for use in

20

schools which will involve people because of their religion*
That was not in Allen,
Secondly, there are entanglement elements in this
statute and in the regulations which depict a substantial
degree of entanglement, how it was decided before Walts, and
the entanglement part of the threefold test, which started with
Schempp, that was not before the Court.
the Court,

But it is now before

And on page 24 and 25 of our brief, we have seven

eight? eight ways in which we submit there is entanglement.
Inviolative of the Wala and its progeny, eight elements of
entanglement that did not exist, were not before the Court in
Allen.
How,
QUESTION?

Before you —

MR. PFEFFER:
QUESTIONs

Yes?

Before you move on, it's not clear to

me what the discrimination is in this case, with respect to
the textbooks,
MR. PFEFFER:

Well, the discrimination is in

respect to the text-books as

well.

If a student wants to, a

pupil wants to avail himself of a textbook which is applied
— it may be a very good textbook, it’s applied for the
parochial schools, they don't have to be the same textbooks
which are used in public schools, they have to be textbooks
which are accepted by public schools but not used.

21

Now, if a student wants to avail himself of that
type of textbook, he can only do so by becoming a student of
that private school; and he cannot do it if he's not of the
right religion,
QUESTION:

Well, —

MR. PFEFFER;

He can't get the benefit of that

textbook.
QUESTION:

— Boards of Education approved a

wide list of textbooks, and then local School Boards and
sometimes the local Superintendent or even the teachers in
the classes have discretion as to which books they use.
Not?;, my understanding — if I'm in error, I wish
you'd correct me — is that all of the school books available
on loan under this Pennsylvania statute are school books which
have been approved for use in the public schools of
‘V “

Pennsylvania,
MR. PFEFFER:
QUESTION:

Now, how can there be any discrimination?

MR. PFEFFER:
is this:

Yes.

Well, the answer — the discrimination

that it is certainly within the discretion of the

School Board to say we will use Text A rather than Text. B,
and the student who would like to use Text B rather than
Text A has no constitutional grievance, unless -- unless the
only reason he's barred from using Textbook D is because of
his race or color.

That's what Norwood v. Harrison held.

22
He is not

there’s no question, I think, that schools have

power to determine what textbooks shall be used, but, from our
contention, they cannot exercise that power on the basis of
the religion of the students, and the requirements that the
students participate in religion instruction in order to get
access to that textbook.
That decision is a constitutional wall between them.

Not, so much for the textbooks.
Not, on instructional materials, again it is our
contention that the instruction materials, in order to make
sure that this is not used for religious purposes, there
must be that

surveillance which the First Amendment forbids.

And the interesting-" and that you cannot rely upon— the
Constitution doesn’t permit, reliability upon the good faith
of the teacher.
That’s what this Court has held time and time again«
The interesting part about this is that the district
court itself, that the district court itself recognised that
merely reliance upon the good faith of the teachers is not
enough.

Because in respect to instructional equipment, they

tried to make a distinction between instructional equipment
which is readily usable for religious purposes and one which
is not readily used for religious purposes.
Mow, if you rely — if the Constitution permits
reliance on the good faith, of the teachers, then this distine-

23
tion is meaningless, and the appellees in this ease have not
appealed from that part of the Court’s decision.
Why do wa rely on the teachers’ good faith in
auxiliary services, as the State of Pennsylvania asks us to
do, why are we asked to rely upon the good faith of the
teachers with respect to auxiliary services, when the district
court agreed you cannot rely upon their good faith in respect
to instructional equipment?
It is therefore bound to use the instructional
equipment.

We —• it is our -— the instructional equipment

which is allegedly not readily usable for religious purposes.
It is our contention that that is a very artificial
distinction, and that with any degree of lawfulness practically
anything can be used for religious purposes.
We’ve given examples in the — in our brief, and
in the decision before this Court, previous decisions, the
Court, for example in the Levitt case —» no, in the part one
of Nyguist, which held unconstitutional a law providing
funds for the maintenance and repair, a pro ratum, of school
equipment and school plant,

And of course if the building

is heated, there’s no way of shutting off the heat from the
classroom in which religion is taught, or the lights.

You

simply »“ the educational system is.such that such a differ­
entiation is artifically impossible.
You can only assure compliance with the

Establish-

24
merit Clause by that surveillance which, as I’ve indicated
before, is forbidden by the entanglement aspect of the
First Amendments
The
Charybdis here?

as the Court earlier said, there is still a
which is simply unmanageable, the Court has

said, in all these cases which I referred to, that they have
gone

allowed textbooks, allowed bus transportation, in

Everson in 1947, and even then the Court said this verges
upon the unconstitutional.

They allowed it over the strong

dissent of four Justices, and the Justice who wrote the
opinion, Mr, Justice Black, has never gone beyond that.
And finally, in 19S8, the Allen case saids
this verges beyond — it went that step.

Okay,

But in the cases

which I’ve cited, in each of those cases, particularly the
Nyquist case, and in the Sloan case, the latest oh©, this
Court said you’re not going to even approach that verge.

We're

not going to do any more, because the verge itself is a
difficult line to draw, and the

values, the values of the

First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment are so high
that we cannot tamper

we cannot tamper or risk the

violations of those values or the

by this, such statutory

provisions.
In the Yoder case, which I believe my brother, Mr.
Ball, argued before this Court, the Court said that while a
secondary education is a high value, is of high value, and

25
the State has an interest in seeing to it that all its
citizens obtain a secondary as well as a primary education,
it is not high enough, it is not high enough to outweigh the
values of the religion clause and, in the Yoder case the
Court said, use both, the religion and Establishment Clause.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM B. BALL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES JOSE DIAS, ET AL.
*

MR. BALL2

Mro Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
We are going to have a division of argument among
co-counsels

I'll address myself principally to Act 194, the

auxiliary services Act? and Mr. Blewitt for the Commonwealth is
going to concentrate mainly on Act 195; and Mr. Heath is going
to discuss various related aspects of this litigation.
For years the State educational authorities in the
various States have recognized that there are individual
children in the schools who need special help, and in response
to this, the States have provided and identified certain kinds
of services which can help these children.
Now, many of these relate to health, while others
relate to learning disabilities, and they all interrelate in
a school situation, first, because that's where the learning
takes place, and that’s the place which is most useful to
afford

services for the correction of deficiencies or the

affording of help.
I might mention also that these services are also
very much tied in to aid to families.

If it please the Court,

we have in this Chamber at this very moment a child to whom we
refer in Footnote 5 of our brief, a little girl named Johnna
Bense, who had a 95 percent decibel loss of hearing, she was

2?
deaf.
Tills related intimately to the fact that she could
not well carry any kind of learning process»
And thirdly, this had all manner of repercussions
on the life of the family, quite obviously.
Now, these services have been known as adjunct
services, thayrve been called auxiliary services, supportive
services, and so on.
Ten years ago the Congress of the United States in
the Elementary and Secondary Education Act spoke of specialized
services, and identified them, for the benefit of all children.
Pennsylvania, for years, had been furnishing
auxiliary services to children in the public schools of the
State.
In 1972, they made this program general by including
all children under the benefits of auxiliary services.
I'm going to discuss the auxiliary services program
in detail in a moment, because I think a great deal needs to
be said on it with respect to facts.

Preliminarily, however,

I want to divert the line of my argument to go into the matter
of the trial which forms the record upon which the judgment
of the court below was based.
I think that's important to do, Your Honors,
because the programs have been attacked largely on presumptions
of fact.

Presumptions with respect to the administration of

28
the Act and how it works; presumptions with respect to
employees of the Stata» who carry out the Act and how they
behave; and presumptions with respect to religious schools»
We knew at the beginning of this litigation that
these allegations and assertions were totally at variance with
reality» and therefore we decided that the prudent thing» from
the point of view of our case, and the best way to achieve
justice would be to put the program on the stand, and then
let the eminent counsel for the plaintiffs have at witnesses,
live witnesses, not stipulated, facts that can’t be crossexamined, but put on the stand, parents put on the stand,
administrators put on the stand, 'teachers who carry out the
program, and then permit; their credibility to be gone after»
If they weren’t credible, let it be shown.
typical, let that be shown.

If they were not

If they were highly selective and

not typical, let that be shown*
But here with, at counsel’s tap, what was indicated
to be simply an ocean of universally accepted fact about all
these matters, when the time came to bring on the tidal wave
of fact and get away from the world of presumption, the
plaintiffs came up bone dry.

They declined to cross-examine

a single witness, they did not put on one piece of evidence or
one witness, rather, to contradict what we through our
witnesses we think had established.
Now, the significance of that is this, if it please

29

the Court;

I think the plaintiffs are asking the Court to

ignore the facts and to ignore this record, how little, in
fact zero discussion we have heard just novr of this record,
and to follow, they beckon the Court to follow them into a
never-never land where valuable social programs may be
comfortably disposed of; by talk of potential, of danger, of
values, of likelihood, of — it may be just that in substitu­
tion for fact»
May I now cover Act 194 under three headings..
First of all, with respect to its subject matter,
then with respect to its administration, and then with
respect to its teachers»
Tine subject matter is services, services directly
to children.

None of these services are required under

Pennsylvania's compulsory attendance law, and therefore a
school affording these services does not, by that fact,
qualify as a compulsory attendance school.
The services of their nature, by statute and by
practice, are secular, are neutral, are non-ideological,
QUESTION:

I didn't understand your point a moment

ago, that schools providing these services do not qualify as
compulsory attendance schools?
MR. BALL:

No, by virtue of the fact that they

afford speech therapy, psychological services, and so son,
those facts, those services do not qualify them as compulsory

30
attendance schools.
The meaning of it is this, Mr, Justice Powell, that
by virtu© of the fact that they hold themselves out as
affording these services does not give them any status in the
school market whatever, because they are not ultimately,
because of that, compulsory attendance schools.

They most

meet the requirements of the compulsory attendance law to
be unite through which the services may be afforded to
children.
QUESTION:

The provision of these services is

irrelevant to their status as qualifying as compulsory atten­
dance schools?

Is that it?

MR. BALLs That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart —
pardon me.
QUESTION:

That’s all right; you flatter me«

MR. BALL:

The services are also obviously of

immediate and meaningful benefit to children.

The record

very definitely establishes that.
If we needed greater testimony with respect to these
services, we have that of eminent counsel, Mr. Pfeffer, who
told the court below:

We do not in the least challenge the

testimony presented by the defense that these services are
invaluable to children,
QUESTION:
straight in my mind,

Are these services, just to get it

31
MR. BALL;
QUESTION!

Yes, sir.
these services are provided in the

public schools, are they not?
MR. BALL:

Yes, and they have long been.

QUESTION:

And long been.

MR. BALL:

Yes,

That is correct, Mr. Justice

Stewart.
These services, he said, were invaluable to
children, to the deaf children, to the otherwise disadvantaged
children? we do not in the least chal3.enge that.
Coning to the administration of tine services •—
oh, by the way, I ought to mention one thing before passing
to that.
Mr. Pfeffer had stated, in his argument now that the
provision of the guidelines which speaks of bringing belowgrade children to grade level status equals in effect the
affording of normal services by the non-'pub lie school,
through the services of the intermediate unit.
The court below faced that, and we have alluded to
that at page 16 of our brief.

The court found that contention

to be without substance, and it did so on the following
grounds:

that, first of all, auxiliary services are by and

large not mandated as part of basic curriculum in Pennsylvania,
and this we have shown by the regulations of the State Board
of Education, which we cite at page 16.

By and large the

32

services are totally new to non-public schoolchildren, a
fact which also the General Assembly very clearly declared
in this Act.
If you read this to mean that the services are
simply ordinary, general services of the schools, we have
contradicted any meaning which the General Assembly and the
Department of Education have given to the term "auxiliary
services"«
In administering the Act, we come to the year 1970,
in which the Commonwealth enacted into law the Intermediate
Unit Services Act, this was we11 prior to the existence of the
present legislation that I'm discussing.
This created 29 entities in the State which would
afford technical and planning services to clusters of public
school districts,
And it is this unit of the public educational system
which administers this Act.

It does so, and administers the

Act on the premises of non-public schools, first of all,
because this affording of auxiliary services had always been
presented in that way, on the premises of the school where
the child is.
Secondly, it was clear that it is the only place in
which these services can be usefully and meaningfully
afforded to children.
The testimony that we have in the record from Dr

33

Horowitz, who, for ten years, has been administering E5EA
services to non-public schoolchildren on non-public school
premises and who has also been the administrator of Act 194
in the School Districts in Philadelphia, which is also the
Intermediate Unit of the City of Philadelphia, is very
eloquent to the fact that logistics, the transporting of
children, are very much — greatly impede any chance of
meainingfully affording these services to children.
One witness. Miss Stopper, a speech therapist in
the Carbon-Lehigh Intermediate Unit, testified to that fact
that because of these kinds of difficulties and the case
loads of people in public schools, it had not been possible
to afford auxiliary services to but 17 out of 350 children
needing speech therapy services*
Nov;, counsel speaks of a modest sacrifice in the
transporting of children to get these services elsewhere.
We ask the Court to look at the record, the testimony in
particular of Dr. Horowitz, as flatly contradicting any
assertion that this is a modest sacrifice and is not indeed a
prime means of defeating the benefits which this Act
recognizes and public policy recognizes that all children
need.
The Intermediate Units administer the Act through
Commonwealth personnel*

They are people who are under the

direct supervision and control of the public intermediate units*

34

They are bound down by the school laws of Pennsylvania, the
regulations of the State Board of Education, and the directives
of the Intermediate Units, which extensively and intensively
regulate the conduct of the Intermediate Unit employees.
They must be properly certified, according to
Pennsylvania Code, Section 49.11.
Nov/, we come to the contention that the people who
furnish Intermediate Unit services create religious problems,
and that this program does that.

Yet when we go to the

record in the case, we find not a single instance brought to
the attention of the court wherein one individual has abused
hi3 office as a public employee in seeking to inculcate
religion in the course of the performance of his professional
duties <
On the other hand, we have positive, unquestioned
and uncontradicted, testimony to precisely the opposite
effecto

Dor Horowitz, who had been ten years administering

ESEA programs on non-public school premises, testified flatly
that he knew of no incident of this kind*
The other witnesses who have testified as the
administration of the Act, testified similarly, and not one
v/ord of evidence discloses, in a State of 67 counties, 29
Intermediate Units, and a program that’s been going on since
1972, any instance of this horrible to which counsel alludes.
We are here impressed by the quotation by Mr. Justice

35

Powell in Nyquist, in which he quotes from Alien» saying that
absent evidence — absent evidence, we cannot assume that
school authorities are unable to distinguish between secular
and religious books or that they will not honestly discharge
their duties.
There is nothing, either, to show that these people,
who perform for the Intermediate Units, go through the experi~
ence which it was assumed in Marburger they go through, of
becoming susceptible to and contracting religion when they
enter upon the premises of a religious school.
There is nothing in the record to indicate that
any one of these people, these many employees, are so mentally
dim that they cannot understand the regulation under which
they are supposed to operate; that they are so psychologically
weak that they cannot help but be overcome by a supposed
and unproved dominant religious atmosphere in a religious
school; that they are so professionally shoddy that they
would threw their professional ethics to the winds in order
to divert .into some religion or other; that they are so
lav;less that they would deliberately violate the lav; of
their State and their nation.
QUESTION:
these people?

Mr. Ball, what's the record show about

Do they spend all of their occupational time

in one school, or do they move around from school to school,
or what?

36

MR. BALLs

The record does not clearly disclose

this, Mr. Justice Stewart.

My impressions, for what they are

worth, indicate that the speech teachers, speech therapists
such as Miss Stopper, whose testimony is here, moves about
in Carbon-Lehigh Intermediate Unit District, which involves
I believe a couple of counties.
QUESTION:

In a geographic area.

MR. BALL:

She is only a speech therapist.

She is

a specialized licensed speech therapist, so there would really
be no occasion for her to stay in one school as a constant
employee of it.

For one thing, the schools can’t use that

much speech therapy or whatever the service may be.
QUESTION:

Might she move, then, from a Catholic

parochial school, where she is on Tuesday afternoons, to a
Lutheran parochial school on Wednesday afternoons, to —
MR. BALL:

Moravian Lutheran, yes, indeed*

QUESTION:

~~ to a non- denominational parochial

school on Thursday afternoons ~~
MR. BALL:

Yes.

QUESTION:

-— and ever into a public school on

Friday and Monday afternoons?
MR. BALL: This I could not say, but she would be
available to be used in public schools also for the same
services, as far as this Act is concerned.
QUESTION: The record doesn't show what the actual

37
practice is?
MR. BMjLs

It doesn’t shot-* that •—

QUESTION;

In this respect.

MR. BALL:

-— there is any particular pattern? and

there may be no particular pattern, Mr. Justice Stewart.
QUESTIONs

Because the claim is? of course, that

these teachers get so imbued and involved with the religious
atmosphere of a particular school that they -MR. BALL:

Well, that, Mr. Justice Stewart, is the

QUESTION:

Yes.

claim, ~~
Well, I thought that this question

might have something to do with that claim, that’s why —
MR. BALL:

Well, we went directly to that con­

tention in examination of three witnesses?

We asked Miss

Stopper, we asked Dr. Boesenhofer, a Lutheran who serves in
Catholic schools according to his testimony, and Dr? Horowitz.
We asked all of these people:

What about this matter of

becoming involved in a religious school, and thus starting
to reflect religion?
This was very staunchly denied, for example? by Dr.
Boesenhofer, who is a school psychologist? who testified that
he is Lutheran, who testified as to his experience in Catholic
schools, and said he wasn't about to start reflecting Luther­
anism and certainly not to start picking up Catholicism from
being present in the Catholic school.

38
I think the testimony — and if there were evidence
of this, as we've said before, the plaintiffs had all the time
in the world to bring on these supposedly innumerable examples
of the very thing that they alleged in their complaint.
QUESTION:

Hr. Ball, —

MR. BALL;

Yes, sir?

QUESTION:

— does the evidence show the extent to

which these services are available in religious schools without
the benefit of State aid?
MR. BALL:

The evidence shows, first of all, it's

the finding of the General Assembly that they were not
generally available in religious or other non-public schools.
As to non-sectarian schools, we have the testimony
of Mr. Jarvis, the Headmaster of Lancaster Day School; we
have the testimony of Miss Stopper and the other witnesses,
in fact, all of whom said —• including parent tvitnesses —
who said that up to now they had not been available in their
schools«
Where there is any evidence that the Commonwealth
has that these had been available to any extent in the
sectarian schools is not known. But the Legislature and the
court below having seen all the evidence concluded firmly
that by and large these services were not available in non­
sectarian, including religiously affiliated schools.
In the last moments that I have, I'll try to deal

39

briefly vrith the questions of primary effect and the question
of entanglement.
On the issue of primary effect, we have to realize
that nature and not this statute has singled out particular
children who need particular help? and this statute responds
to nature, to those needs.
There is no class here singled out for a special
economic benefit.

This is in no wise comparable to situations

seen in Sloan, Myquist, and so on.
QUESTION:

ITow about Marburger?

Is somebody on

your side of the table going to deal with Marburger?
HR. BALL:

Yes.

I’ll do it right now, Hr, Justice

Steii/art.
Marburger, first of all, in terms of the book
program, involved children as — the Marburger opinion stated
that children in public schools were borrowers of books.
By and large, the Act was a parent reimbursement Act, whereby
non-public schoolchildren did not borrow books but instead
their parents were given a cash payment.
There v/as an allotment of funds for each public
school, something like -- each non-public school, something
like a bank account in Marburgerf which is not present here.
There was a further fact concerning the Marburger
case, is that there was no evidence introduced at the trial
respecting constitutionally critical facts concerning these

40

very tilings we've been talking about# whether the public
school teacher has to be the object of surveillance.

Whether

in non-public schools and religious schools# the attempts
are made by religious authorities to proselyte teachers who
come into the schools.
None of these things were ever reviewed in Marburger
in terms of witnesses, and this is the — one of the major
features of importance of the record in this case# that at
long last we have witnesses on the stand who are able to
testify as to what happenes in real life and not what happens
in fantasy; which# indeed# I must say# Marburger reflects# in
respect of the issue of surveillance and entanglement.
QUESTION:

Do you think the — the biggest differ­

ence# or at least a very substantial difference between this
case and Marburger is that here you have a record of evidence
in the testimony# and in Marburger you just had the bare bones
of the statute, aided by speculation and .imagination; is that
it?

MR. BALL:

That# Mr. Justice Stewart, plus the

fact that I think Marburger in no wise faithfully followed the
decision of this Court in Board of Education vs. Allen.
QUESTION:

So# just as your brother is asking us to

overrule Mien# you're suggesting that we overrule Marburger;
is til at it?
MR, BALL:

No# I'm not suggesting Marburger be over-

41
ruled, because I cannot read Harburger, and I cannot read the
mind of the Court in affirming Harburger.

I am reminded,

in the words of the Chief Justice recently, that some are
quick to use the district court's opinion to define this
Court's j udgmenfc„
And I think that I cannot conclude that this Court,
in its affirmance of Marburger, in any wise reflected a
desire to overrule Allen or to affirm all of its presumptions
with respect to entanglement.
I didn't observe whether the red light —
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

It did.

You are now

cutting into your colleague's time.
MR. BALL:

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Blewitt.

He didn't use very much of your time, however,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. JUSTIN BLEWITT, JR., ESO.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES PITTENGER AND SLOAN
MR, BLEWITTs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I'd like to begin my argument by stating what I
consider to be two basic principles that have run through all
of this Court’s decisions under the Establishment Clause as
they relate to education.
First is that the State has a recognised interest
in the quality of secular education in all non-public schools.

42

And the second general observation is that some form
of State aid can be directed to the secular function of a
religious school without providing thereby direct aid to the
religious functions of such schools.
This theme has been restated in every Establishment
Clause case which has coma before this Court.
The question, then, is:

Does Act 195 meet this

test?
In answering that question, I'd like to address
myself to what is being provided by the enactment,., and I feel
that by focusing on what is provided, the Court will see that
this enactment passes both the entanglement and primary
effect test.
What is provided are three types of educational
aids:

textbooks, educational materials, and instructional

equipment.
A very limited type of instructional equipment, I
must mention:

slide projectors, record players? instructional

equipment of such form is not permissible by virtue of the
district court's order and by virtue of the amended guideline
which we have submitted to replace the original guideline,

,

which did authorise that equipment.
Now, they are the three types of equipment, -the three
types of educational aids; but, in addition, these educational
aids have two characteristics.

First, they must be secular;

43

second, as to texti>ooks, they must be acceptable for use in a
public schooli and as for instructional equipment and
materials, they must be such as are provided in non-public
schools.
So I think it's important to emphasize at the outset
that plaintiffs don't even claim, much less make any attempt
to prove, that any form of religious material is being
provided under these Acts.
QUESTION:

Would you clarify, for me at least,

your comment about the curtailment of the equipment loans?
You suggested there was an alteration of the program on
equipment, ~MR. BLEWITT:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor,

— slides and movie projectors, that

sort of thing.
MR, BLEWITT:

Yes, Your Honor. The enactment and

the guidelines promulgated pursuant to it originally had
a very broad definition of instructional equipment.

It would

have authorized the loan of slide projectors, overhead
projectors, record players, tape recorders.
The district court, I think, fashioned a very
healthy rule by prohibiting the loan of materials which are,
in the words of the district court, readily divertible tea
religious purpose.
We adopt — by not appealing, we have adopted that

44
~ that standard fixed by the district court, and we think it
a healthy standard.

Because the district court has fashioned

the concept of a self-policing educational aid.
One can look at the aid and determine, merely by
looking at it, whether or not it can perform any sort of
religious function.
How, the appellants have made some attempt to
distinguish A31Len, I think that attempt is unavailing.

1

can see no way in which this program could be found
unconstitutional, and yet this Court should retain the vitality
of the Allen holding.
The two are virtually identical, and I would suggest
to the Court that in reviewing the guidelines which implement
this program, this Court look to the brief of the intervenors
in Board of Education v, Alien, which has attached to it as
an appendix the guidelines for the New York textbook loan
program. They are virtually identical.
QUESTION:

Mr» Blewitt, are you familiar with an

article in 79 Yale called, Sectarian Books:

The Supreme

Court and the Establishment Clause, x^hich was published after
Allen?
MR. BLEWITT:

I have read it, but not recently, Your

Honor.
QUESTION: So you have no comment about the article?
MR. BLEWITT:

I can't offer one.

45

But I think the point of Allen was that the officials
who must make the decision as to what is loaned are public
officials, and in deciding whether to -- whether a given
educational aid is permissible, can be loaned, the public
school official is making the very same decision he makes all
the time in deciding what materials can be loaned to a
public school.
In essence, the school official is really making
one decision, no matter where the request for the educational
aid comes from, whether the request comes from a public school
principal or from the non-public schools, he is making one
decision:

is this acceptable for use in public schools?
There is nothing in this record to suggest that

public school officials will not honestly discharge their
duty, or that they are unable to distinguish between
religious and secular materials.

So I think it's important

that what we're here providing is tangible educational aids,
their content is ascertainable in advance, the aids themselves,
by their very nature and by virtue of the necessary priorapproval of the public school authorities, cannot be
diverted to religious use.

They are self-policing.

And I think this, the concept of self-policing, is
not only important but essential to our case.

For the concept

of self-policing, in and of itself, answers two questions.
It answers the primary effect question and the entanglement

46

question.

Because the material cannot be used for religious

purpose, then it is being restricted exclusively to a secular
use, and therefore there is no danger of a primary effect of
advancing religion.
Because the -QUESTION:

Rut that pcirt of Mr. Pfeffer's argument

is that it’s not feasible to conduct a monitoring of that,
to see that it is, that the statute is complied with.
MR. BLEWITT:

But, Your Honor, what we suggest is

that no such monitoring is necessary.

The school official

who decides what is to be loaned -QUESTION:

Yes, but it passes from his control then,

doesn't it?
MR. BLEWITT: But what I'm suggesting is that the
material is not, cannot readily be used for religious purpose.
That spectrum was present in Mien, you know, you cannot
decide what a teacher is going to do with a secular textbook.
But •—
QUESTION: Well, I take it ycur point that you made
earlier, that the modification of the guidelines has taken
care of this problem, that is, equipment which could be used
either for

secular or sectarian purposes is now out of the

program?
MR. BLEWITT:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Why do you use the word "loan”?

47
HR. BLEWITT:
QUESTION:

I beg your pardon, Mr. Justice?

Why do you uss the word "loan"?

Do you

anticipate any of this material will ever come back?
MR. BLEWITTs Well, we consider it to be a loan in
the same — the Act refers to the legal relationship as a
loan, and it is the same form of loan that was present before
the Court in the Allen case.

Mr. Justice White, in writing

the opinion, acknowledged that oxtfnership, at least technically,
remains with the State.
So the concept of loan is equally the same as in
Allen as in here.
I’m sure that the textbooks which were loaned to
the private schools in Allen are no longer functional, they
have long since lost their utility,

But, I mean, that was a

factor that was present in Allen, and was not deemed
• - «now

controlling.
QUESTION: Well, isn’t that fairly common in the
public schools in Pennsylvania, for students to be loaned
textbooks and perhaps for the books to survive two or three
or four years?
MR. BLEWITT:

Oh, yes, Your Honor, absolutely.

And of course that feature of the Act, it was a
point made in our brief, but since you’ve touched upon it,
Mr. Justice Rehnquist —> the argument has been made that this
is class legislation.

Well, it certainly is not class

43
legislation because what is being provided here for the nonpublic school students is being provided through other pro­
visions of the public school code for public school students»
This Court, in Nyguist, recognized that direct aid
in any form is invalid, absent effective means of assuring
tit at ‘the material -- what is loaned, will be used exclusively
for a secular purpose.
Here the guarantee comes from the nature of the
equipment loaned, it cannot be diverted to any other than its
original purpose.
Every school aid program - excuse me, every
educational program which dealt with private schools,, which
has reached this Court since Allen, has dealt with money,
cash subsidies in one form or another, to private schools or
private school students.

And of course the trouble with money,

probably its only trouble, is that money, when money is
provided it must carry with it restrictions on its use, it
must be earmarked for a particular purpose.
And to the extent that the earmarking takes on a
pervasive character, the other objection, the Charybdis of
the Establishment Clause would be violated, would give rise
to undue entanglement.
MR. CHIEF justice BURGERs

We'll resume there at

one o'clock.
[Whereupon, at 12;00 noon, the Court recessed, to
reconvene at 1;00 p.m., the same day.]

49

AFTERNOON SESSION

[1 sOl p.rru ]
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Blewitt.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JU. JUSTIN BLEWITT, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES PITTENGER AND SLOAN “Resumed
MR. BLEWITT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
Before my colleague begins, I will make one point
in one minute.
The point that appellants make throughout their
brief, of examples of how some of these educational aids can
be subverted for religious purposes, I submit, in the first
instance, that they are hypothetical in every sense of the
word, these examples.
In the dictionary sense, they are not based on
facts.

No proof has been offered that materials, or that

such examples as they hypothecate have ever in fact occurred.
Furthermore, such possibilities were equally
present in Allen, and this Court wisely refused to resort
to this form of conjecture.
The third aspect of tire hypothetical nature of
these examples is that they’re predicated on bad faith.
They suggest bad faith on the part of the non~public school
personnel who x^ould be using these materials.

There is no

record of bad faith in this case, in fact there's a record

50

of good faith. I refer the Court specifically to page A92
of the Appendix.
This Court, in Tilton, recognized that a possibility
always exists of a lavr's legitimate purposes being subverted
by conscious design or lax enforcement.

The Court recognized

that such possibilities, standing alone, do not warrant
striking down the statute as unconstitutional.
Til is is important State action, and it should not be
invalidated on the basis of hypothesis.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Blewitt.
Mr. Reath,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY T. REATH, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES CUESIK, ET AL,
MR» REATHs

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I v?ould like, in the few minutes left to me, to
first restate the issue which I think has been fully argued.
And the issue is:

should this Court exercise its

admitted power to invalidate State action where the legisla­
tion under attack has the proven primary purpose and effect
of improving children's learning and communication skills,
and where there .is no disqualifying provision in the statute
denying such benefits to children attending religious schools.
I appear this afternoon, if Your Honors please, on

51
behalf of taro parents and two children attending private
independent schools,

I also serve as counsel for the

Pennsylvania Association of Independent Schools.

I am

appearing essentially as the spokesman for the independent
schools, and at this time I would like to say I of course
join in the arguments made by my predecessors, and I also
join in the brief that was, the amicus brief filed by the
Council for American Private Education.
I don't think I need to take this Court’s time to
dwell on or emphasize some basic constitutional principles,
which is that there is a strong presumption of validity to
the propriety of State action, and that one who seeks to
overturn it has a very heavy burden, and I believe, based
on the arguments that Hr, Ball and Mr, Blewitt have made, that
it has been shown hew they have utterly failed to meet this
burden, they have offered no evidence whatsoever.
Mr, Pfeffer, in his argument, made a charge which
I submit was totally unwarranted and not in this record, a
charge of discrimination,

There is no evidence of discrimina­

tion in this record, and that is fully developed in our
brief at page 19, and I won't take my valuable time mow to
answer it.
Secondly, as far as the availability of these
auxiliary services are concerned, under the present statute
they are now equally available to children in parochial

52
schools, in privata schools or in public schools; and there
is complete and total freedom of choice among the children as
to which of those school systems they will use to avail
themselves of those benefits.
Secondly, if Your Honors please, and I think that
this is very clear, I've referred to it at page 13 of our
brief, in Everson, the Court had this very issue before it,
where the question was, whether or not the State of New Jersey
could exclude the benefits, certain benefits to children in
religious schools,,
And here's what the Court said;
"While we do not mean to intimate that a state could
not provide transportation only to children attending public
schools, we must be careful, in protecting the citizens of
New Jersey against State-established churches, to be sure that
we will not inadvertently prohibit New Jersey from extending
its general State law benefits to all its citizens without
regard to their religious beliefs."
And the record shows here unequivocally that these
are general State benefits now offered to all children,
regardless of their race, religion, color, or creed»
Finally, I would submit, and again I’ve developed
this argument at page 35 of our brief, and I incorporate it
in my argument; that it would be impermissible and highly
unconstitutional for Pennsylvania to attempt to inquire into

53

the religious practices or beliefs of any child in order to
determine whether that child was eligible to receive the
benefits.

.It would be a denial of the equal protection, the

free exercise arguments which these plaintiffs seem to claim
to represent in attacking this legislation.
Now, if Your Honors please, I would like next to
very briefly refer to this Court's decision in PEARL v. Nyquist
and Lemon v, Sloan, because I would submit that that is our
point of departure.
And this Court, in an opinion for the Court by Mr.
Justice Powell, held and struck down tuition reimbursement and
tax credit because.it was felt that this conferred in some
fashion or other a special benefit on children whose parents
— on children and parents who were attending religious
schools and thus had the disqualifying effect of being —
have a primary purpose of aiding religion.
At the same time, the Court, in Mr. Justice Powell's
opinion, rebuffed the very same arguments that are being
advanced here and have been advanced before, and that is,
there must be an absolute wall of separation and that there
must be an absolute ban on the provision of any form of
public aid to non-public education.
And there the majority held that aid still can be
channeled, albeit it may be a narrow channel.
Happily, tlxis Court did give us some aids to

54
navigation, and the aids to navigation I believe were these:
One, to pass muster, it must not be class legisla­
tion, it must be something available equally to everybody.
Two, it must be neutral, non-ideological.
Three, it must be indirect.
Pour, it must be only of incidental benefit.
I submit that Pennsylvania Acts 194 and 195, in all
respects, stay within the narrow channel prescribed.

It is

not class legislation, it benefits all children.
It is neutral and non~ideological? it deals with the
tools for learning, and the ability to improve one's
communication and learning skills.
It is indirect, no payments are made to the schools?
the benefits are given to the children.
There is no real benefit to the school directly,
because, at most, it could be deemed incidental in that, again,
the benefit goes to the children and not to the school.
It is self-policing.

There is no problem with

entanglement.
A perfect example of that, Mr. Chief Justice, to
elaborate the question Your Honor asked earlier, was that this
Court — the lower court said, for example. We will not permit
you to lend moving picture projectors, because a movie
projector could be used to show a religious film.
So that those are out.

Any kind of a training aid

55

that could lend itself to be used for religious purpose is
excluded. What is left is only a self-policing type of
auxiliary teaching material or textbook or a service that
deals not with the core of the educational program but deals
with such things as remedial reading, to improve the learning
skills and the communication skills of our children.
And I Submit, therefore, that in all respects we
have met the test of the Nyquist case, and the Chief
Justice's admonitions in Lemon v. Kurtzman.
There are in Acts 194 and 195 none of the evils
which this Court has been concerned about, the evils of
sponsorship, financial support, or active involvement in
the — by the sovereign in religious activity.
In conclusion, I'd like to say this, Your Honors
please, I think that we in this country have placed a very
high priority on the role of education and the role of our
Judiciary in preserving and strengthening a free democratic
society.
As to the role of education, I would submit that
we stake the very survival of tire republic on a literate,
educated, informed and, hopefully, enlightened citizenry.
We have had a love affair in this country with
education, and rightly so, because through education it makes
us free.
At page 10 I have a quotation in my brief, the

56
only one I want to read, from lord Broughman, Henry Peter,
the eminent English statesman, jurist and scientist, whera he
said;
"Education makes a people easy to lead but difficult
to drive? easy to govern but impossible to enslave,"
Secondly, as to the role of the Judiciary, recant
events., and a landmark decision by this Court, have highlighted
the critical role of the Judiciary as the fulcrum in disputes
between branches of government and between the people and
government.

And to perform this function, of necessity it

has, and it must have, great power, including the power to
invalidate State action.
But I would submit that in matters involving State
action, it must be — this power must be used sparingly and
particularly in matters of State action, only where there is
a clearly proved and patent infringement of constitutional
rights, not found in this case.
In respect to State action, we are now witnessing,
and in large measure spurred on by this Court’s decision in
Baker y. Carr, and its progeny, the development of what might
be called a new federalism? a return swing of the pendulum
which recognises that we’re going to put more responsibility
and power on the individual States to work out, in harmony
with the federal government, to solve the vexing problems
that beset our society.

57

And I submit tills is good* and it should be
encouraged.

For only by trial and error, by the process of

experimentation, can be chart a safe course that will give
us the answer to constitutionally valid tests.
The people of Pennsylvania, through their duly
elected representatives, have determined that this form of
legislation is desirable to strengthen their coramitruant to
the working of free democracy, to education, to enable these
children to have the learning skills and the communication
skills that they need.
Anyone who would deny the — and I submit that this
is proper •— anyone who would deny the power of the States to
do this ha3 a very heavy burden, and that burden, I submit,
has not been met in this case.
Vie ask your honorable Court to deny the appeal and
to affirm the judgment of the court below.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr„ Reath.

Mr* Thorn.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM P. THORN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR* THORN:

Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please

I would like to devote the minutes that I have to
attempting to answer some of the questions that have been
raised.
First of all, I believe it was Mr. Justice Stewart

58

who asked the question as to how the Allen statute could be
distinguished from the Pennsylvania statute.
There is a very real distinction.

In the Allen case,

the statute provided for the loan of textbooks, free textbooks,
to a.11 schoolchildren in the State of New York, both public
and non-public.
Act No. 195 provides only for the loan of textbooks
to non-public schoolchildren.
New, the Act recfcies that the other, that the public
schoolchildren in Pennsylvania already have the benefit of
free textbooks.
However, I would like to point out that it's the local
School Board which provides textbooks to public schoolchildren
in Pennsylvania, and not the State. The State has singled out
a special class of beneficiaries for which it is using taxraised States revenues for the support and adminisfration,
QUESTION:

But there must be State law that

authorizes the local school board to do the same thing for
public schools, is there not?
MR, THORN:

It mandates that they do it.

The

Pennsylvania statute mandates that they local school board —
QUESTION:
MR, THORN e

For public schoolchildren?
~ provide — Yes,

QUESTION: Well, then, there is no distinction.
MR, THORN:

Pardon me?

59

There is this distinctions

the local school boards

must raise the funds, provide the textbooks from local
revenues, not from State revenues? although the State reimburses
the local School District for part of its expenditure.
Initially, the expenditure must come from locally raised
revenues,
QUESTION; What percentage of the school budget is
provided by State funds?
MR. THORN:

Public school budget.

Well, they have a complicated formula

-— I believe it's approximately 50 percent.
QUESTION;
MR. THORN:

That would be about average.
It's about 50 percent, as I remember.

QUESTION: Well, wouldn't you agree that it's
constitutionally irrelevant as to where and how the financing
comes from, so long as it is, we all agree, governmental
financing?
MR. THORII:

I don’t think so.

But here the State

has singled out a special class of recipients.
And it's provided in a separate channel, a different
channel,
QUESTION:

But isn't it — am I mistaken in

understanding that this law here at issue gives to the
students in private schools what is already and has been for
a long time given to the students in public schools?
MR. THORN:

No, your — that is correct.

60

QUESTION:

That is correct# is it not?

MR. THORN: That is correct.

But public schools do

not —
QUESTION:

And both with public money?

MR. THORN:

Yes# except different taxation, different

sources of funds.
Now, the second thing I'd like to speak to is the
issue which my brother Ball raised, concerning burden of
proof.

He has stated that it is our

job to prove that the

supplies and materials and services mandated by these
statutes are being misused for religious purposes.
However, it is not our burden, at all.

This Court

has held in several .instances that the burden is upon the
State to make certain, given the religion clauses, that
subsidized teachers do not inculcate religion? Lemon v,
Kurtizman.

And furthermore, the State must see to it that

State-supported activity is not being used for religious
indoctrinationj Levitt vs. Committee for Public Education and
Religious Liberty.
So -the burden is not upon the complainants, but,
rather, is upon the State or Commonwealth to prove that.
Furthermore, there is a record.

In the record we

introduced guidelines, established by the Pennsylvania
Department of Education for the administration of these Acts?
and we believe these guidelines show beyond any peradventure of

61

a doubt that, there's pernicious entanglement with religion
by the State in administering these laws.

They just can * t

be administered without numerous contacts with the non-public
schools.
As an aside, in one of our interrogatories we asked
the defendants to state whether any of the persons employed
by defendants or the Intermediate Units to provide auxiliary
services were previously employed by the non-public schools
to which they are assigned.
The answer of the State is that there are seme
situations where this does exist.
In other words, what has been done in some
situations is simply take auxiliary service personnel from
the non-public school payroll and put it on the public
school payroll.
QUESTION:

Mr. Thorn, —

MR. THORN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir?
— does the record show whether or not

the private schools in Pennsylvania require their pupils to
take the same standardised achievement tests that are required
in the public schools?
MR. THORII:

I don't believe the record shows that,

but 3! believe that is true.
Is it not?

[addressed to co-counsel.]

QUESTION:

The record is silent on that question?

62

MR. THORN:

The record is silent on that.

Hoi-zever, testing is one of the services provided
under Act No. 194.

What "testing" encompasses , I’m not sure.

We believe the statute is so open-ended that it could cover
almost anything.
QUESTION: There's no evidence in the record as to
comparative test scores between students in the public and
private schools, is there?
i
MRi THORN: No. Only on hearing defects, and I think
speech defects.

There is soma evidence in the record on those

two tilings,
QUESTION:
MR# THORN;

Righ t.

Right,

Yes .

One of the claims of the defendants is that the
statutes are self-policing.

We believe that that just isn't

so.
Obviously the district court below did not think they
were self-policing; otherwise it would not have rewritten Act
No. 195 with respect to instructional equipment. And that’s
really what the court did, because the Act itself states that
instructional equipment is to include projection equipment,
recording equipment, laboratory equipment, and any other
educational secular, neutral, non-ideological equipment as
may be of benefit to the instruction of non-public schoolchildren, and. are presently hereafter provided for public

63
s chocIchildren.
The court excised projection equipment, recording
equipment, et cetera, from the statute.

So, in effect, it

rewrote the statute.
Also, the non-public people apparently don't think
the Acts are self-policing.

Dr. Boesenhofer, who testified

as a school psychologist on behalf of Intervenors Diaz, et al.,
and Miss Stopper, a speech therapist, and Sister Mary Dennis
Donovan, the Coordinator of Human Relations Education for the
City of Pittsburgh, for the Catholic schools of Pittsburgh,
all said that they had been repeated warned by the public
school author!ties that they had to be very careful that
none of these services, none of the supplies or equipment
were used for religious purposes.
QUESTION:

Does that tell us any more than the

statute tells us?
MR. THORN:

Well, I think it tells us this:

It

tells us that it can't be done without constant surveillance,
or without constant reminders.
And I think the State has to do more than just
remind them, I think the State has to see to it that they're
not used for religious purposes.
Since my time is about up, I'm going to summarize
tills way:
Act No,

194 provides services which are part of a

64
modern secondary educational institution»

The characterisation

of "auxiliary" does not mean that they are auxiliary to the
school system# but simply are auxiliary to the normal
instruction program of the school»
They’re part

and the witnesses for the Intervenors

testified that these services were essential to modern
secondary educational system.
X see tliat ray time is up* so I won't go on*
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well# Mr. Thom*

Thank you# gentlemen.
The case is submitted,
[Thereupon# at 1:24 o’clock# p„m,# the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
