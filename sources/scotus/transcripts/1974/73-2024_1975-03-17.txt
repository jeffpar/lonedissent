OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MRS. LOGAH—B&Li/i'ECU:
please the Courts

Hr. Chief Justice,- and may it

This case is before the court, by a writ

of certiorari to the Second Circuit Court of AppealsThe
District Court for the Western District of New York originally
dismissed the complaint on two grounds;

Hone of the petitioners

had alleged standing to sue and that no crina was stated»
The Second Circuit Court of Appeal;? affirmed solely
on the ground none of the petitioners had standing to sit.
Thus the record before this Court consisto only of
the complaint of the plaintiffs, the motion papers of the
respondents on the motion to dismiss, and dr.? affidavits in
opposition to that, motion to dismiss.

The record, then, as

it stands, mast be reviewed by assuming that ell of the
material allegations

of the complaint are true, and the

complaints must be read in the light most favorable to the
construction of this allegation

by the complainant

to grant

any relief that could be possibly granted with a fair and
;»”r

liberal reading,of that complaint.

4
\

The basic complaint of the petitioners is that: the

zoning ordinance of the town of Penfield, Hew York, on its face
and as applied is illegal, and unconstitutional, being racially
arscriminatory.
The question before this Court is whether any of the
petitioners have alleged injury in fact and. that injury being
within a zone of interest of a constitutional or statutory
provision which petitioners allege that the respondents
violated.
The petitioners before the Court arc •
groups, or three categories»

First of all, the petitioners are

low and moderate minority income persons who claim that they
have been forbidden or excluded from residing in the town of
Ponfield by the operation of the Town of Penf.ie.ldIs racially
exclusionary zoning ordinance.
Secondly, the petitioners are organizations and
associations of persons whose members have been‘actively
involved in efforts to amend the zoning ordinance of
of Penfield to permit the construction of low, mederate,
multiracial income housing there, although it actually made
proposals for the construction of such housing In the town of
Penfield, all to no avail.
The first of these groups —
yUtoTION:
multiracial, do they?

They don't need an ordinance to make it

Your Honor, our contention
that the homebuilders and other private builders and entities
have actually made proposals in the form of housing construction
which would be within a range which can be purchased by low
and moderate

multiracial persons.

The town lias arbitrarily

refused to grant variances, exceptions, and so forth to a
very rigid zoning law which dictates the construction only of
very expensive and exclusive housing.

So that the application

of the zoning ordinance dictates a racial stratification in
population.
QUESTION:

May I inquire, is there a concretu zoning

application refusal in this record?
MRS. LOGAN-BALDWIN:

There are a number of insv.ances,

your Honor, of attempts
QUESTION:

Specific.cases with the parties involved,

your clients?
MRS. LOGMtf-BALDVflN:
clarify that.

Yes,, your Honor.

And let me

The Second Circuit Court of Appeals in

position suggested that there really weren't that kind of
concrete proposals.

X submit, your Honor, that that is; a

misreading of the. record.

The fact is that both thr to ofus tar

Hove '.Ruiiciers and. other entities such as Penfi&ld Bataev Lomas f
which is a member of petitioner Housing Council, have actually
tried to have, such construction approved by the Town of
Penfield.

All -these efforts have been denied, all those

b

applications.

The Penii/-.: Id B it tore Ecman application to

rezone was denied by the town on the basis that the housing wag
not appropriate or consistent with the use of the adjacent
properties, which is slugle~family dwellings,
X think fills case fails beyond even those other cases
vmicii the Second Circuit suggested of concrete housing
proposals.

All efforts here have been totally -frustrated, a

far worse situation than any of those other cases.
I might point out with respect to the Rochester Home
Builders, they allege in their complaint not only have they
•>

made these various and numerous applications, for exceptions to
1die zoning ordinance, but that the. Town of Penfield lias
threatened that if they pursue this lawsuit, if they
rectify the exclusionary soiling ordinance, that they well not
be allowed to do business in the ordinary course of doing
business with the public officials of the town, in the.ordinary
course of construction of exclusive housing in the town.,
QUESTION?

Is Penfield Better Homes,the one that you

mentioned had a plan denied, did they ever seek to review the
action of the zoning commission .in the New York courts?
HRS. LOGAI'I-BAI.DNXIJ;

They did not.

They possibly,

us we indicate in our brief, could have done so.

But. the mere

fact that they did not pursue that course, of course, does not.
prevent them from proceeding as part of a membership organiza­
tion to the Federal court to get redress for these illegal

\Q 1

.

acts pursuant to the at «.hut so of the Constitution»
QUESTION;

How long before the filing of this suit

in the District. Court had the Penfield Better Hemes applicatiori
been turned down?

Does the record show that?

MRS. BOGAN-BALDV/IN;

It does, your Honor.

The

Penfield Better Homes application is included in the record as
a part of the affidavit of Mrs. McHabb, and I believe the date
is 1971 for the conclusion of the denial of that.

And the

immediate preceding acts, the acts immediately preceding the
filing of this complaint, were specific and concrete proposals
of another organization Metro-Act of Rochester for the Town
of Penfield to amend its zoning ordinance so that this
construction could take place.
QUESTION:

Is Metro-Act a builder?

MRS. LOG&N-BALDWIN:
QUESTION;

Metro-Act is a civic organxKufcioa

is it a builder?

MRS. IjOGAN-BALDWIN:

It is not .‘a builder.

not engaged in construction itself.

It aas

It has engaged in a

number of efforts to encourage construction.

One of its

members, Mrs. McNabb, this affidavit I have just referred to,
in a member of Penfield Better Homes.

So there is an itteractio

between the group plaintiffs and their efforts to build low
and moderate income housing in the. Town of Penfield.
QUESTION;
do you envisage?

If you prevail here, what type of remedy

0
NR5,

i

We i 3., the complaint: ?.skc dr:

a declaratory judgment that the zoning ordinance is racially
discriminatory and therefore illegal and unconstitutional and
that there be an- appropriate zoning ordinance drafted,, proposed
and enacted»

Simply the same type of relief that this Court

has granted in a number of the cases involving racial d:i«crimina
tiorr.
QUESTION;

Is it only the standing issue here?

I

suppose it is, isn't it?
HRS o HOGAN-RhliDWIN:

Tills' Court- has only the rtendi.ag

issue, your Honor ■—
QUESTIONS

So if the court below was - wrong below,

it would still have to rule on whether there was a cause
action stated..
MRS. LOGAN■•’BALDWIN;

Well, I think that the Court

would have two choices in terras of dealing with this case,

Ton

could certainly remand to the Second Circuit telling it ro
proceed with the further consideration of whether a claim re­
stated on its face,

I think, however, that tills Court could

also remand to idle Second Circuit with directions because, cue
record, I tic .?

clearly establishes beyond a shadow- or

doubt that a claim is stated.

This is a typical claim of

racial discrimination pleaded in the most traditional form,
and there are many cases of this Court which would indicate this
a properly stated claim,

QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that on this record

we could make the determination to tell the Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit that the comp lair.'-, stared a cause of
action?
MRS. LOGAH-BALDWINt

X think the record would permit

the Court to remand with direction.
choices, though.

There are clearly two

The only question before this Court is

reached.
QUESTIONS
justicious

Do you think there is an issue here of
as well as standing?

MRS, LOGAIJ-BALDIfIN:

1 don * t think, your Honor ,

I

think if you refer to a question of rightness, if I understand
your question correctly. I think there could be no such -reading
on this record.

Rightness would involve a consideration of

whether issuet have reached a point of administrative finality.
This zoning ordinance was adopted in 1962.

We had hud numerous

Its pattern of enforcement

The plaintiffs clearly can show that that pattern

of enforcement is totally racially exclusionary.
QUESTION;
remedy you envisaged.

This is why I asked you about the: type of
And part of your answer was, I take it,,

that you would expect judicial enforcement of a drafting of a
new ordinance.
MRS. LOGAN-BALDWINs

Well, 1 think, your Honors, that

in a case of racial discrimination, such ai
affirmative relief has been a part of a district court*s
handling of a case, 1 think it would be appropriate here-

1

think- though, again, if I could focus on the one issue that
is before the Court, and that, is standing, and that as to the
nature of relief, that is within the province of the district
court.

There, of course, has been no proof, no depositions,no

interrogatories.
QUESTION*

Yes, but it went off on the ground also

that the complaint did not state a cause of action.
MRS. LOGAN-BALDWIN:

The district court only, your

Honor.
QUESTION*

Therefore, either the Second Circuit or

this Court has to say that it does state a cause of action
before there can be a trial.
MRS , LCGAN-BALDWIH*

That *s correct.

Only 23 or those perrons were

In the 1970 Census the population of the town had

practically doubled to 23,782 persons.

At that time there ware

only 60 black persons.
The ordinance of the town is so drastic that there
cannot be any construction there except exclusive housing.
QUESTION:

.

Is Panfield immediately contiguous to

Rochester?
MRS. LOGAN-BALDWIN:

It is.

It is one of the

suburban towns which encircle the city of Rochester.

appears in the record beginning —
QUESTION:

What are their qualifications to tell

Panfield what it ought to have?
MRS. fcOGMT-BALIMXN:

Well, these are persons who

actually are involved in drafting of ordinances, involved in
the study of zoning ordinances.

Two of these experts have

participated in actual studies of zoning ordinances, including
the Town of Panfield's ordinance, on behalf of the metropolitan
governments of the Rochester area.

And.in that study which was

conducted in 1970 the expert concluded that the only reason
for the total absence of low and moderate incane housing in
the suburban towns, including the Town of Penfield, is racial
prejudice,
QUESTION;

But who are these experts?

MRS, LCGAM-BALDWIN;
at the University of Rochester.

One, Mr. Kling, is a professor
lie is generally known as an

urban planner.

Professor of what?

MRS, LOGAN-BALDWIN:

Professor of urban planning.

And degrees of what?

question my Brother Blackmun was asking, what were their

been as careers involved in considerations of what are
permissible land uses and spaces in communities.

of space?
MRS. LOGAN-"BALDWIH:

affirmative acts of officials of a town to so classify . nd v-c

MRS. LOGAN-BALDIfINs

The record doesn't address

itself to that specifically, your Honor.

There are, according

to census figures 60 blacks as"of the 1370 Census.

Thera is

a housing study in the record of the Town, of Penfiald itself
which would seem to indicate ' that the persona with large:
incomes, of course* are occupying very* very expensive houses

QUESTION:

What evidence do you have that the blacks,

the poor blacks rather than poor whites are excluded?
MRS. L0GM3-BALDWIM:

Well, the first evidence, yosr

Honor, is the housing study c.c Monroe County which was con citecxd
in 1970 which indicated that the primary motivation for the
exclusion of this type housing is to exclude blades»

The

second indication is in the record in this 1971 study of the
town itself which concludes that its impact is totally
exclusionary.

I hope not.

MRS. LOGAN-BALDWIN:
QUESTION:

No, your Honor.

No.

No or yes.

There are, are there not, in

the Rochester community?
MRS. LOGJkN™BAI.DWIN:

That is correct, a house costing

QUESTION;

No, in this town right here,.

MRS• LOGAN-BALDWIN:
QUESTION:

In Penfield?

Yes.

MRS.. LOGAN-BALDWIN: I don’t think the record speaks
particularly to that question, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, is there anything in the record that

shows that there is no Negro in the Rochester area that can
afford a $2I,00C house?

The answer is no, because i:

the record, it wouldn't be true.
MRS. LOGi^-BALDWIN:
QUESTION;

Right.

So .it is true that the fact that. $21,000

limit does not exclude all Negroes.
MRS. LOGAN-BALDWXNs

Hot all, that’s right.

QUESTION:

It does not.

QUESTIONs

Mrs. Logan-Baldwin, suppose we were to

rule in your favor on standing and the Second circuit or the
District Court were to rule in your favor on the constitutional
question, as a result of that ruling would there be any
identifiable parcel of land or building that would be then
available for your clients?
MRS. LOGAN-BALDWIN;
QUESTION:

Yes., your Honor.

Can yon tell us from the record what the

parcel would be?
MRS. LOGAN-BALDWIN:

Well, the record has a report of

the Town of Psnfield which examines its total land area.
QUESTION:

I mean simply as a result of the ruling

that I have described, could you point fcq an identifiable parcel
that would then be available?
MRS. LOGAN-BALDWIN:

Yes, your Honor.

csen several proposals that we have talked about.
QUESTION:

There have
Obviously

Are they still pending?

MRS. LClAH-BALDIvIN:

There are some so-called gleamed

unit development proposals that are in some stage of

20
process.
QUESTIONS

But: dc

ov . the Lend or

an option on the land?
MRS. LOGAN~BALD5aJIN:

In the case of planned unit

development# there is actually ownership or options, and
could proceed.
I think it's very interesting to note the experience
.of the Town of Penfield with the planned unit, development
ordinance, in order to accent what I ait saying about racial,
prejudice.

This type of an amendment to the ordinance is

ordinarily viewed as a way in which you can construct low and.
moderate multiracial income housing.

They announced the

ordinance, but when builders sought to use that ordinance to
construct this housing, the town board specifically responded
and reacted to citizen pressure suggesting that this would
permit those people to move in and property values to go dcwx?
and reduce the permissible

.„

so that what started

out to he the utilising of the ordinance for the construction
of this type housing resulted in either those projects being
abandoned completely —
QUESTIONs

Doesn't it take a special use permit to

give a planned unit development under the Town of Penfield?
MRS. LOGAH-BALDTJIN:

Well, there is an especially

cumbersome process, you might -say.
QUESTION:

You can surely answer that yes or nr,

can’t you?

Does it or does it not?
ICRS. L0GAN-BAIJ3WIII:

Yes, I slake that for special

use«
QUESTION;

Then what you are complaining about is

that the board refused to grant the special use permit?
MRS. LOGAN-BALBWXN:

Vie 11, they, have not processed

completely these planned unit development applications.

Our

allegation is that they have either delayed them inordinately
or so modified them to transform them into exclusive hcuring
so that essentially those efforts have failed.
QUESTION;

On the thesis that you advance here? I

suppose that if there were an area in the 20 miles or 30 miles
out of the large city which was laid out for minimum 10-acre
lots, 10-acre tracts for people who wanted to have a lot of
space and perhaps ponies for their children and what not, that
would be vulnerable to the constitutional attack you made as
soon, as the low-income housing began to press up against that.

MRS. lOGAN-BALDWlN;

Well, your Honor, again, I.

don't think that case reaches this.

We have here only n

question —
QUESTION:

Is there a difference in principle from

what you are advocating here?
MRS - LOGAN-BALDWIN;

No.

Again, what we are tcIking

about here are affirmative acts of the Town of Penfield to
exclude minorities.

Now, we have to, of course, have our day

in court, on those allegatione .
QUESTION?.

Well, of course, if 20,-000 square feet

can be made out as exclusionary, then 10 acres very clearly
would bo more exclusionary, would it not?
MRS. LQGAN--BALDWIH:

Well, yes, but, again, what we

are talking about are particular individuals who make a claim
that the affirmative acts of the town have a particular affect
and pattern and each case would have to be examined on its
own.

But we are saying here that this is racially motivated

and it's the same as the town hanging a sign outside of the
Town of Penfield that minorities are not wanted here
that same effect.

1 would like to direct ray —
QUEST!OHs

If the sign said minorities with less

than $21,000 are not wanted.

QUESTION:

Well, again, your Honor -—

Are you on the racial point or the money

point?
MRS. LQGAN"BALDWINs
racial point.

Well, your Honor, we are on the

We obviously have to at the time of trial

introduce the evidence which substantiates that.

But in the

record the conclusions are that the enforcement of thee
ordinance has been with that intent, in mind.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr.

ORAL ARGUMENT 'OF JAMES M. HARTMAN OH
BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. HARTMANs
the Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I must take issue with the argument just made in

that there are instances in this record that would indicate
what my adversary concludes.
here is very, very sweeping.

First of ail, the relief sought
It is to declare the ordinance

of the Town of Penfield unconstitutional, to enjoin its
enforcement, and to require a new ordinance to be passed.
Second, we have' these individual plaintiffs, the
real plaintiffs who originally were in the case, people who
are indeed members of minority groups and who are members
who are poor, who are poor members of minority groups.
Not one of these individuals has made a single
application for housing in Penfield.

One of these persons,

Mrs. Angela Reyes,alleges in supporting affidavits which'were
submitted on the motion to dismiss this complaint chat she
looked around for two years, that she saw a broker and that
one broker was helpful.

. *

She has an income of- $931 a month., she

25
and her husband, and disposable income for housing of'$231 &
month.

That*3 the extent of her — and that's the '-•lost that's

alleged by any plaintiff.
QUESTION:

Individual plaintiff.

MR. HARTMAN:

Individual plaintiff, yes

your Honor,

which, X would like to treat first.
Then they allege in addition in the complaint that
the zoning ordinance of the Town of Penfield discriminates
against minorities because it .hasn't waived, modified — the
administrators of that ordinance haven't waived, modified,
amended, granted building permits or variances of any kind
to relieve this situation.

But there is not a single

applica­

tion for such a permit except by one of the association members
who is not a plaintiff and who is not a party, doesn't seek to
be a party.
Now, we are talking about, a very broad constitutional,
effect tnat this Court should rule allowing these plaintiffs
to have standing, because we are talkingabout the fourteenth
amendment.

We ought to talk in terms of what specifically

did these plaintiffs do to create a fact context which would
indicate to the Court that the fourteenth amendment has indeed
bean violated.

Without these facts what cun we work with?

What relief will we give?

Will the relief — first of all,

the adjudication may be unnecessary because on an application
for some kind of relief from the zoning ordinance, it might

very wall be granted,.

If it’s denied, at least so:m controversy

confrontation with the town or its administrative agencies won'
have taken place to give a factual context within which

make

a constitutional determination of its import.
Now, right now none of those affidavits indicato that
any plaintiff wants to live in Penfiold.

One says I might

want to live there, that^a Ortis" affidavit.

Reyes doesn't

mention wanting to live in Penfield, or that they will live in
PenfieId.
Have they bean injured?

Or is this allegation and

their position totally speculative, because if relief wore
granted, which they seek, the abolition in effect of the
Ponfield zoning ordinance, would these, individual plaintiffs
receive themselves any substantial relief?
injured?

And have they been

They have a personal stake in the outcome of this

i-tigation, if they haven't alleged they tried to gal; info
Ponfield or that they even desire to get into Penfield?
Isa*t this kind of like O’Shea v. fittieton, where the relief —
they riadn * t ripened into a position to be relieved by any
judgement.

And I think we have to look at this matter .from the

vantage point, of the complaint and overlook the litigation
that would take place to the outcome of that litigation aad
determine in order to determine standing whether that outcome
would in effect affect these plaintiffs.
Now, I would like to go, if I may, to the association,a

plaintiffs.

And what I have said concerning the individual

plaintiffs applies to the association».! petitioners.
a plaintiff/ Metro-Act.

One is

One, there was a motion, made tc bring

in, the Housing Council in, the Monroe County Area.

Nov?,

that motion was denied because standing 'was denied for all the
other petitioners.

And the motion is sort of surrounded by

some procedural vagary because it doesn't refer to rule 19
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which indicate whem a
party should he joined as a plaintiff and/or as a defendant
depending on the circumstances.

In any event, the motion to

bring them in is denied and they seek to be made a party
plaintiff, and it is the Housing Council which refers to
Penfield Better Homes who is not a party and doesn't seek to be
-

'

'f

'■

Now, the Housing Council is basically an association

of associations and public agencies.

The Penfield Better Homes

did, indeed, at one time apply for a project called Highland
Circle in the Town of Penfield and sought variances or permits
or actually I think an amendment to the zoning ordinance,
was denied.

it

As a matter of fact it was. denied in 1969,

September of 1969, and then a rehearing was had in November of
'69 and on January 12, 1970, there was a denial of any further
public hearing, and these are in the appendIk at pages 631,
381, and 883.
How, for two years Penfield Better Homes did nothing.

They have dons nothing yet.-

The. Housing Connell is moved to

complaint in ti

ction.

But Housing Council has no

If Housing Council were allowed to

remain standing as a party to this action, there are no
allegations because they had not yet put in a complaint.
Now, is Housing Council derivatively in a better
position to pursue these rights than is Penfield Setter Homes
who had lawyers, mad© the application- was turned down and
was turned down on three grounds — erosion problems, traffic
problems, and that the project was inconsonant with the
surrounding neighborhood, which is a general arid classical
way that variances and rezonings are turned down in towns
that are inconsonant with the neighborhood.

If they didn't

bring the action, are wa to assume that that was done on
racially discriminatory grounds?

If Penfield Better Homes

for two and a half years and today has not instituted any kind
of action or proceeding in either the State courts in the
State of New York ore in Federal court alleging anything, no
less racially discriminatory conduct or a racially discriminatory
effect of the zoning ordinance of the Town of Penfield, is
Housing Council derivatively to assert that through an
affidavit of Mrs. MoN&bb who is not yet a party and has no
complaint?
QUESTION;

Is the record clear one way or another as

29

to whether cue of too mascot that this organi ztitica was turned
lawn was because it wanted to build houKas on lots that tore
smaller then provided for in the toning ordinance?'
MR. 1L1RTM&Ni
Honor.

Yes, sir.

The decision is in the record, gear

The decision is in the record and girts

as its reason those three things I havo related.
QUESTION s

I knew, but you still havenft answered my

guestion, I gather.
MR. HARTMAN;

1 don't know that it's because they

wanted to build housing of a greater density than would
ordinarily be allowed.
QUESTION*

1 think so.

What was the basis for saying that their

project wouldn't be consonant with the surrounding neighborhood?
MR. HARTMAN;

I think because it was for higher

density multiple family housing in an area that was surrounded
by residential single ferally housing.
QUESTION:

Is that clear in the record?

MR. FARTMAN:

It should be clear in the record,

your Honor.
QUESTIONS

Now, if an organisation applies for

a variance to build other than single family dwellings on
lots of a specified size, it is turned down, I suppose it
have had at that point, say, standing to litigate in tha State
court as to whether the zoning beard decided correctly.
MR. HARTMAN;

It has two methods you can use in the

30
Mew York State court.

If the denial was done in an administra­

tive manner by an administrative board,
proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Law e.;:i
Rules, which is a review in the nature of certiorari rvrdv\vur(at cetera.
QUESTION:

You would have a personal stake in it.

MR. HARTMAN:
QUESTIONs

Oh• yes, they have —

Well, if he went across the street in far

Federal court and said, "I've gotten hurt here by a so.ai.ng
ordinance that's unconstitutional and I want it declared
unconstitutional," would you say he didn't have standing?
MR. I'ARTMdN:

He xnay not agree with his cause of

action?
QUESTION;

But how about standing?

MR. HARTMAN:

He may have standing in the Federal

court if he raises a Federal constitutional issue, certainly.
If that partner makes himself a plaintiff in a Federal action
and says because of this instance in this factual context
then I confronted the Town of Penfield and sought relief,
I allege that they denied it for racially discriminatory
reasons, I think he would have standing.
QUESTION %

Not raci; illy discriminatory reasons ■ bat

because — well, I wanted it because I wanted to build higher

density housing than the zoning —*
MR. HARTMANs

Then you would not have standing.

If

31
it was just for higher density housing, you would not have
standing,
QUESTION:

Ha was denied his permit for that reason.

i\nd he goes and says the zoning ordinance is unconstitutional,
to have denied me this is unconstitutional.

Now, why doesn't

he have Standing?
MR. HARTMAN:

Well, he would is he raised a valid

constitutional question under the Federal Constitution, if he
says he had been deprived of property.

If he would allege he

has been deprived of property, for instance, ho can't develop
this property -—
QUESTION:

I gather your argument anyway is he

didn't do it.
MR. HARTMAN:
QUESTION’S

He didn't do it.

This association of which Pen-field was

a member attempted to do it.
MR. HARTMAN:
QUESTION:

Right.

That’s correct, your Honor.

Aren't you confusing standing with valid

defense of a constitutional claim in the answer to Mr. Justice
White's question?

In other words, you say he would have

standing if he made a valid constitutional attack on the
ordinance.

The two are somewhat separate.
MR., HARTMAN:

Yes, your Honor, they are separate.

Now, I say he would have, standing if his constitutional
question were raised in a specific factual context which is

32
lacking here, not just because he raised a constitutional
issue, no, no, no,.
QUESTION:

ire saying that if Penfield Homes

had gone over to the Federal court right after they were•denied
.and said this particular application is denied for this rearon,
they would ha/e standing.
MR. HARTMAN:.
QUESTION;

Yes, your Honor.

Regardless of the merits of their

constitutiona1 alaim.
MR, HARTMAN:
in that case.

That’s right.

They would have standing

But in this record there is no instance cf that,

had I say can an association — there are association cases
been brought and sustained.
in certain circumstances.

An association can bring a case

-But are they An a better position

than Penf-ield Better Homes — and they are not seeking that
litigation, they have joined in the general abstract speculative
nature of the case before, this court.
QUESTION:

In this connection, now that we have all

interrupted you, there is a fair amount of talk in some of
the amicus briefs about title VIII of the

'68 Act.

Is there

any allegation whatsoever in the complaint about title VIII?
MR. HARTMAN:
QUESTION:

Not to ray reading of the complaint,

Was it considered by the court below?

MR. HARTMAN:

Not to my knowledge, year Honor,

that they presented to the Town of Perulield.

Now, what

happened, and it's in the record, is they came in with this —
now, the zoning ordinance of the Town of Penfield is 89 printed
pages and it covers a multitude of issues which are properly
the concern cf local government.

Metro-Act comes in and says,

'Me made a proposal, four typewritten pages, which starts off
with a threat of litigation if you don’t listen to us.

It

alludes to no particular property, but it says houses ought
to have a square — land ought to be 7,000 square feet for some
houses.

Now, if the individual plaintiffs,

if some of them

are members of Metro-Act and they haven't described a specific
injury, how can Metro-Act now derivatively have a better claim
than any of these individuals?

MR. HARTMAN:

Let tv® add this:

Or any other board.

That even going beyond a specific

interest in property or going beyond a specific parcel of
property, I see no reason, if relief is sought from the To\n\
of Penfield, that some step shouldn't have been taken to
confront the town and say, We want some land zoned.

MR. HARTMAN:

1 would say —

He could make the application.

MR. HARTMAN:

X see no reason not to.

And I tell

you, if he’s denied a hearing on the application, that might
give him some kind of standing.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hartman.

MR. HARTMAN: Yes, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Would you describe briefly the procedure

in Penfield for one who wants to build a house?

First of all,

he gets a building — he applies for a building permit.
MR. ILARTMAN:

No, he applies — he first has to

submit a sits plan if it’s more than one house, or a subdivisio

plan fcr the planning board.
QUESTION:

A site plan, ai

MR. HARTMAN:

HR, HARTMAN:

Yes.

The Article 78 proceeding

the zoning board has final jurisdiction over appeals from
enforcing officers and also ad initio# if you will# jurisdiction
to grant variances.

If he's denied there# he goes right to

court.
QUESTIONS

How broad is the jurisdiction to grant

variances?

MR. HARTMAN:

Oh, a great deal is discretionary,

There are certain New York State cases which hold —■
instances in which variances are proper and when they are not#
and some of the things are that there is a unique problem that
it will not do violence to the general character of the town
and that kind of tiling.
I must say that there is a lot of latitude in the
language of the cases as well as the authority of the zoning
board to rule on these things.
The last group of petitioners here .. oh, I'm sorry,

X

forgot one organizational group# which is the Horae Builders#

and they seek to intervene.

They say that they, number one#

have not been able to build low and middle income housing
bepause of this racially discriminatory ordinance and that
they have been injured.

That’s the extent of it.

Not a

single instance of a single home builder attempting to get a
single permit or make an application for a single variance
is in this record,

laid these people are in a position — that8

39
their business, to buy land, to take, options on land, to get
into contracts for the purchase of land.; and go in and get
variances and get zoning relief because they do it all the
time.

V

QUESTIONs

Does the ordinance permit an option or to

make an application for a variance?
MR. IIARTMAN:
optionee, optionor.

Yes, your Honor.

Contract vendee,

Usually, they are joined in by the ovmer

and the potential purchase.
QUESTION:

Didn’t Mrs. Logan-Baidwin say there were

some plaintiffs in this case

or maybe

applicants for

intervention who in fact had options or owned land?
MR. HARTMAN: She said so.’ V It8a not,in.the record.
QUESTION:

She did say that, didn’t .she?

MR. HARTMAN:

Yes, but it’s nor in the record except

for Penfield Bettor Homes.
Now, there are some parts that are indeed by this
time under construction, but at the time of the complaint, the
PUD ordinance of the Town of Penfield happens to say
QUESTION:

What ordinance?

MR. HARTMAN:
sorry.

P-U-D, planned, unit development, I*m

We use it every day.

— happens to say that the purport

of this is because we recognize the need for housing at all
economic levels.

Now, it's a new ordinance, a new field, but

there are four PUD’s, planned unit developments, under -wav at

40
soma stage in Penfield.
Now, this Homs Builders — as I say, not a single
instance in the record

by those in the

best position to test this ordinance.

So can again the

Association of He so Builders, derive or obtain derivatively
a better right, can they assumo an injury vhen.no member has
pleaded an injury?

And I say again there * s a broadside attack

that they hava been threatened about bringing a suit.
There was a motion made hare and 900 pages of material
carae in and not one specification on that and it apparently
didn’t dissuade them from trying to intervene in the suit,, so
X don’t know where that statement comes in because there is
just no way that 1 could state anything about it.

There is

nothing in the record to verify or support that if they brought
this suit the./ would be in trouble in Pen field.
Now, the third group of petitioners are plaintiffs
,[?h.c sued in tie nature of taxpayers, and I don’t think that I
ought to address myself to that at length.

X think that, simply

reason I want to live in Penfield is to be close to work, it's
close to a job and you save a lot of gasoline, and it has good
schools there.

X think again the focus and the

question for this Court is standing, have these plaintiffs»
these petitioners alleged injury in fact, and I think the real
problem with cfc.e argument of the defendant respondents is
that they are focusing as if there had been a full trial on the
merits,, as if we had aired all of the ramifications of the
toning ordinance.

All the low-income minority petitioners, as is
confirmed in the record,» have actively sought to live in the

Town of Peafield.
