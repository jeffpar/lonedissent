MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

Mrs, Shapiro,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. HARRIET S„ SHAPIRO,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MRS. SHAPIRO;

Mr, chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on direct appeal by the government
from a decision of a three-judge district court in the Northern
District of California.
In this class action, the court struck down the
nine-month duration of marriage requirement for entitlement
to mothers and stepchild benefits imposed by section 416(c)
and 416(e) of the Social Security Act,
That Act provide? benefits for surviving minor
children of the wage earner and for the mothers of those
children and, as the Court said this morning, the fathers,
so that they need not work outside of the home.
But 416(e) of the Act defines a child of a deceased
wage earner to exclude short-term stepchildren. That is, ones
whose natural parent had married the wage earner less than
nine months before his death.
And of course the mothers of such ineligible
children are not entitled to mother’s benefits, to permit them

4
to stay home to take care of the ineligible children.
QUESTIONS
the nine months?

Mrs. Shapiro, do you know the reason for
Why is it nine rather than ten or twelve

or —
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Well, the indication is -that Congress

felt that nine months v/as long enough to deter marriages
designed to obtain benefits. There is also apparently some
idea that, for in soma short period there isn’t the kind of
dependency developed which needs to be recognised by social
security payments when the expectation is disappointed.
QUESTION;

Is it related to the period of gestation?

MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Not so far as I know.

thy not?

MRS. SHAPIRO:

The court balo;-/ found :hat the nine»

month, eligibility requirement was unconstitutional, because it
thought that, it established a conclusive presumption that
shorter marriages are undertaken to secure benefits.
It concluded that claimants, like Mrs. Salfi and her
daughter, Doreen Kalnins, are constit.utiona!3.y entitled to
disprove that presumption.
The district court was wrong.

The duration of

marriage requirement is a substantive limitation on eligibility.
It reflects a legislative policy decision that marriage alone
is not a sufficient qualification for benefits.

And that it's

the stepfather's obligation to support his stepchild which

5
generally matures over time*
Still less is it as —
QUESTIONS

Does that depend, to some extent., on a

State-by-State analysis?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

No, it —

QUESTION: Are there some States in which the step­
father has no obligation at all?
MRS* SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

The Social Security Act requires

No, I'm speaking of State lav/, though.

MRS, SHAPIRO:

Yes, but the Social Security law

doesn't make the eligibility turn on the State law require­
ments .
QUESTION:

Mrs. Shapiro, if what you just said is so,

why is there the exception in the statute for death by
accident?
MRS, SHAPIRO:

Well, this reflects one of the

important factors in the Social Security Act that the — each
specific provision reflects the interrelation and the resultant
effect of many different policies; that the general policy
may have an exception because of other policies which impinge*
The accident section was added in 1967$
part of

it was a

there were two exceptions put in at that time*

One was for the survivors of servicemen, who die on active
duty.

And that, fairly obviously, was designed to recognise

the particular special responsibility, federal responsibility,

for people who are killed in the federal service.
And Congress may have thought that people who die in
accidents are in some sense similar.

They, too, are likely to

be young, and the Act has always had particular concern for
people, the survivors of wage earners who die before they have
a chance to build up financial security for their families, in
leaving young families.
QUESTION:

So that in your view, then, a distinction

between a death by accident and one by a surprising heart
attack is a policy decision?
MRS. SHAPIROj

Yes.

QUESTION: Even though the wage earner might be 33,
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Well, the other basic -- well, the

Congress, in the duration-of-marriage requirements, was looking
t

at the problems of the question of motivations for entering
into valid marriages.

They didn’t want to pay benefits to

those who married simply to get benefits, who thought of
marriage as a condition of eligibility for government subsidy.
But the provision is not a kind of a rough evidentiary
tool to identify those marriages which were entered into out
of a desire to obtain benefits.

Instead, it is designed to

serve as a deterrent or, more precisely, to make sure that the
Act doesn't become an incentive to marriage.

Congress thought

that few people would marry for benefits which they couldn't
get for many months after marriage.

7
And that’s why wives of retired workers are not
entitled to benefits unless they’ve been mcirried for a year.
It's also why widows and. their children, in appellees’ class,
are not entitled to benefits on the basis of a marriage which
ended in death in less than nine months.
If the duration*-of~marriage requirements were
simply evidentiary presumptions , the waiting period for wives
would make no sense, because all wives are entitled, after a
year.
So that that provision has no evidentiary purpose
in identifying marriages motivated by a desire for benefits»
The fact that there is tills waiting period, for
wives as well as for widows, demonstrates the deterrent purpose
of all the duration-of-marriage requirements.
They are substantivo conditions of eligibility, and
they are designed primarily to avoid any incentive -the Act
might otherwise provide for marriage.
The fact that, as Mr. Justice Blackmon mentions,
there is a small group of survivors that Congress has excused
from these duration~of-marriage requirements doesn't, indicate
any general exception to the provisions of the Act requiring
duration-of-marriage»
QUESTION;

Mrs. Shapiro, is the United States

satisfied there was jurisdiction in the district court here?
MRS. SHAPIRO;

We are not satisfied that there was

8
jurisdiction to the extent that it imposed a -- identified a
class and required retroactive payments to all members of the
class„
QUESTION:

What about the jurisdictional amount?

MRS. SHAPIRO;
QUESTION:

Well, —

The United States made a motion, I

gather, to dismiss.
MRS. SHAPIRO;
QUESTION;

Yes.
Based on that.

It’s possible.

They're right on the

The child is -- was currently fourteen.

She would

ordinarily be entitled to benefits until she’s eighteen, or,
if she goes to college, until she’s twenty-two. And if she’3
entitled for five years, 01: about five years, she'll make it.,
Bat —
QUESTION:

Yes.

MRS. SHAPIRO:

The payment of benefits to the

survivors of accident victims, without

immediately, doesn't

undercut the deterrent purpose of the statute, sines when death
is by accident it's by definition unanticipated.

And so

payment of benefits in accident cases can be no incentive to
people who might be contemplating marriage to obtain benefits.

9

Of course, death from natural causes can also be
unanticipate d«
QUESTIONS

Well, suppose you have a problem as to

whether it is by accident?
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION s

Well —

Then what does the Department da?

MRS. SHAPIRO:

Ordinarily, I think that the fact

that it was by accident would appear on the death certificate:
that in the vast majority of these cases the fact of an
accidental death is pretty much self-evident.
QUESTION;

Is suicide excluded?

That's what they usually get into a fight over in an
insurance case:

whether it was an accident or whether if. was

suicide.
MRS, SHAPIRO:

I am not sure whether suicid© is

excludedQUESTION:

Or whether after an automobile collision

the victim has a heart attack and dies.
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Well, the definition —

Is it death by accidant?

MRS. SHAPIRO:

— the definition of accident, in

the Act says that it has to ba solely by external causes.
The Act
QUESTION:
the same litigation

Always the same definition and always

10

MRS. SHAPIRO;

But unexpected death from natural

causes is far more difficult to identify.

A claim could be

made in any case where death occurred within nine months of
the marriage,.

The Secretary would then have to make a

judgment as to life expectancy at the time of marriage.
And that judgment is, by its nature, speculative,
and the possibility of error is evident to any who might be
tempted to marry for benefits.
There are, thus, rational reasons for Congress to
have decided to waive the duration™of"marriage condition for
survivors of accident victims.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Shapiro, let me interrupt yon once
/

again.

Thera was a time in the Federal Estate Tax lav; when

a gift made within three years of death was deemed to be mads
in contemplation of death.

Isn’t this statute rather

reminescent of that?
And that was held, invalid, as I recall.
Until it was changed,
MRS. SHAPIRO;

Well, the function of this provision

in this Act is to deter the entering into marriages in order
to obtain benefits.
I believe it’s the deterrent purpose of this statute
■that distinguishes in.
Congress has usually moved step by step in revising
the Social Security Act, and extending the benefits to

11

particular classes, as particular problems are identified»
One of tha things Congress considers in deciding
whether to extend the benefit, is the effect on the fund
created by the Social Security

the fund which is created

from the taxes, out of which the benefits are paid.
Social Security System is supposed to be basically
an insurance program. And so the actuarial soundness of the
fund is a matter of great concern to Congress.
A decision that the fund can afford the obligation
to pay benefits to survivors of accident victims doesn't mean
that it can also afford payment to survivors of other short­
term marriages, or that it could afford to eliminate the
duration-of“marriage requirement, altogether.
The sufficiency of the fund is basic to the effective­
ness of the insurance system.

And so in this area it is

particularly important to permit Congress to move step by
step in expanding the obligations chargable against the fund.
So long as there is a rational basis for distinguish­
ing the categories that Congress defines, this Court should
not interfere, particularly when, as here, there's no classifi­
cation involved which requires any kind of higher than normal
judicial scrutiny»
On the retroactivity question, we rely primarily
on the discussion in our brief.
I would like to address briefly the appellees'

12

statement that our sovereign immunity argument is only a claim
that they failed to exhaust administrative remedies.
We discuss in our brief the reason why we believe
that 42 USC 405(g) is the only possible jurisdictional basis
for this suit,

And that section has two important limitations

on the waiver of sovereign immunity.
First is the requirement that the administrative
remedies must be exhausted.
But, second —

MRS. SHAPIRO;

MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

The problem that we see
As a matter, I’m inclined — maybe I'm

wrong, but I think our provision as to retractive benefits

MRS. SHAPIRO:

I didn't notice the provision for

retractive payments in *—
QUESTION:

Oh, yes, it's there.

It's in the order

v;e affirmed this morning.
QUESTION;

>You don't want us to reverse ourselves

14
the same day, do you?
[Laughter. 3

Z just don't want you to order

MRS. SHAPIRO:
retractive payments here.,

The other provision in section 405(g) is that the
claim must be filed within sixty days of the final administrac­
tive decision.
So even if the exhaustion requirement can be ignored
in cases raising constitutional claims, the time limit must
still be respected.

Because once a claim has been denied,

and sixty days have passed, that denial is final.

And the

finality is important to the actuarial assumptions on which
the Social Security System is based.
It protects the fund out of which the benefits are
paid from any possibility that large contingent liabilities
will be built up*
Individual appellees here filed promptly. But the
class recognised by the district court includes all those
previously denied benefits because of the nine “-month rule.
It thus includes claimants whose denials became final more
than sixty days before this suit.
And as to those claimants, there has been no waiver
of sovereign immunity.

And payment of the benefits to them

imposes just the kind of liability on the fund that 405(g)
designed to avoid.

There’s about $35 million in this case,

is

15
which is serious enough.
But a decision that class actions can be used to
avoid the finality provisions of 405(g) is even more serious,
because that would mean that any denial of benefits, based
on a statutory requirement, later declared invalid, could be
reopened at any time in a class action.

And the contingent

liability of the fund is then enormous and totally unpredic­
table.
And that’s the kind of actuarial nightmare that
405(g) is designed to prevent.
I would like to reserve the rest of my tin®.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Kates.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DON B. KATES, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. KATESs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I’m Don Kates, counsel for appellees in this matter.
Before I go into my prepared argument, I'd like to
respond to a question which Mr. Justice Rehnquist asked.
I'm informed by ray co-counsel that there's a specific
regulation relating to suicide.
If it is found as a matter of fact that the suicide
was so overly ill that he didn’t

know the consequences of

his act, it is accidental? otherwise the suicide is considered

16

a — is considered to come under the nine-month conclusive
presumption»
I would also like to respond just briefly to the
allegations here that a justification may be offered for the
nine-month rule in terms either of deterrence or of proving
dependency of the stepchild and the widow upon the husband»
As to deterrence — I mean, this is covered in our
brief — but as to deterrence, there's no deterrent factor
of this rule at all, because there's no penalty in this rule»
If a man terminally illis induced to enter into one of these
sham marriages, and manages to hang on for nine months after
the marriage, then the widow and any children she has are
entitled to benefits.
If he doesn't manage to hang on, nobody has lost
anything*

There's no deterrence at all*
Mr, Justice Blacknun, I believe, referred to the case

of Heiner vs, Donnan, in which we had a two or three-year
conclusive presumption of a donor's intent to give a gift in
expectation of death»

There was equal deterrence in that case,

if deterrence consists merely in the fact that if they catch you
out you don't succeed»
Deterrence, in our view, if I may give the example
of a bank robbery situation, the United States has not merely
passed a law saying that if the FBI catches up with a bank
robber he has to give back the money; the bank robber also

17
goes to jail.

That’s deterrence.

That's a cost which occurs

in excess of any benefit that you may have gotten through the
fraudulent or other illegal conduct.
QUESTION:

Has there been much doubt in the past

as to whether they could get the money back?
MR. KATES:
QUESTION:

I beg your pardon, sir?
Has there been much doubt in the past

that they could get the money back, in your hypothetical,
or your illustration?
MR. KATES:

There certainly has been some doubt,

although I understand that the lav; applies equally. Your
Honor, whether they get the money back or not.

Perhaps the

bank robber gets a little off his sentence for that, but he
certainly doesn't go scot-free, as would occur in our case;.
QUESTION:

In your case of the terminal illness

of a person, you say that nobody loses anything; but if the
purpose of the thing is to deter that kind of marriage just
for the benefit, I would presume that the spouse who is
going to marry the terminally ill person would be a little
less likely to do it if she knew that he had to last nine
months»
MR. KATES:

She might, be a little less likely to

do it, Your Honor, but if the marriage is a sham, which is
what this rule is directed at, I don’t see why she really
would. , She doesn’t have to live with. him. She doesn’t have

18

to do anything at all except marry him, and if he lives nine
months, she’s automatically a widow.
QUESTION:

Well, but some consequences certainly

attach to marriage, other than getting Social Security
benefits»
FtR. KATESs

Yes, Your Honor, but I don’t see that

any of the deleterious consequences would apply, such as they
may be — speaking as a bachelor —
[Laughter. ]
~~ that I don’t see how any of those deleterious
consequences would apply to a sham marriage of this kind.
The facts in this case, Your Honors, typify what’s
happened in thousands of cases, because of this nine-month
rule.
The deceased wage earner, Londo Salfi, was an active
and healthy man of 52 years at the time of the marriage, with

a life expectancy of 21 years.
Routine -medical examinations demanded by his
employer, including one within a year of the marriage, showed
that he had no heart problem or any disease or debilitation
whatever as far as physicians could determine.
Indeed, the possibility of a heart ailment was so
far from his mind that, like all too many other people, he
dismissed the first heart attack, which began about a month
after the marriage, as acute indigestion? and a physician was

19
only called after the symptoms persisted.
After his death, Mrs. Salfi applied for survivorship
benefits for herself and the child by a former marriage,
only to meet an absolute bar of the nine-month rule.
She offered medical and other evidence to show that
the marriage was genuine and not contracted in contemplation
of death, but none of this could be or was considered by the
Social Security Administration, because of the statutory
conclusive presumption that whore a marriage is entered into
in contemplation «•- is entered into and the man dies of
natural causes, non-accidental causes, within nine months,
the marriage is conclusively presumed to have been a sham
entered into in contemplation of death.
Mr. Salfi’s unexpected death in this manner is by
no means an isolated, extraordinary or unusual kind of event.
On the contrary, ©very year thousands of people are struck
down by heart attacks or other ailments in the prime of life.
What is unusual, however, is a conclusive presump­
tion that, where this occurs within nine months of marriage,
the marriage was a sham entered into with expectation of
death.
We wish very strongly to emphasise that the Social
Security Administration has submitted absolutely no evidence
whatever that such fraudulent applications

or that such

fraudulent marriages, to result in fraudulent applications,

20

are nor or ever have bean any kind of a problem for them.
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose Congress made a judgment

that it was enough of a chance that they should take some
precautions against it.
MR. KATES:

Yes, Your Honor.

that is what Congress did.

We can agree that

However, the lack of any evidence

as to the prevalence of the matter goes to the gravity of
the evil, goes directly to that issue and undercuts any
attempt to justify the nine-month rule —
QUESTIONs Well, let's assume ■— let's assume there
was evidence of a substantial incidence of fraudulent claims.
Would that make a difference to you?
MR. KATES:

It would not make a difference to our

conclusive presumption argument, Your Honor, but it would male©
a difference —
QUESTION:

Then why are you arguing it?

MR. KATES:

Pardon?

QUESTION:

Why are you arguing it?

MR. KATES:

We also rest this case on an equal

protection argument, Your Honor, and we feel that a classifiestion is, per se, unreasonable where it is so overbroad —
well, to give an examples
QUESTION:

A classification

You're suggesting Congress, in a law,

may not classify — may not treat a group as a class, unless
every single member of the group --

21
MR. KATES:

Absolutely —

QUESTION:

shares the -»■» shares -the same

ch aracteristic?
MR. KATES:

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

But we

think that a classification is fatally overbroad if it tosses
out 99 innocent people to catch one malefactor.
QUESTION:
MR. KATES:

What if it were the other way around?
If it were the other way around, we

think that it might well be acceptable.
QUESTION:

Well, on what?

On both equal

protection and conclusive presumption?
MR. KATES:

Ho, Your Honor, only upon equal

protection grounds,
QUESTION:

Well, what about conclusive presumption

in that case?
MR, KATES:

A conclusive presumption, Your Honor,

is unconstitutional, unless
QUESTION: Then you are saying Congress cannot
classify in tills way unless every single member of the class
shares the trait.
HR, KATES:

For the purposes of the conclusive

presumption doctrine, Your Honor, a conclusive presumption
must be universally true.
QUESTION:
tiiis, aren't you?

You're relying on Stanley v. Illinois in

QUESTION:

Well# and any other Justice whenever you

[Laughter. 3
MR. KATES:
QUESTION:

Absolutely# Your Honor!
Yes.

So what is your answer?
MR. KATES:

We do not believe that other than

23
marriage there is a special relationship.
However# that would not distinguish this case from
Viandis or United States Department of Agriculture vs. Murry
or Heiner vs. Dorman# or Schlesinger vs ^ U is cons in.

All of

them conclusive presumption cases, without any special
relationship.
QUESTION:

I take it, in your answer to Justice

White, you’re really reaching for unattainable perfection,
aren't you?
MR. KATES:

No, Your Honor, all that we seek in

terms of the equal protection clause — in terms of the
conclusive presumption matter, we believe that, as this Court
has repeatedly held, a person is entitled to prove the facts
of his or her entitlement.

And that Congress may not

arbitrarily decide that an evidentiary conclusive presumption
— a presumption in this case of a falsehood

can be

substituted for the person’s right to prove the actual
facts.
In Mrs. Salfi's case, and in thousands of others,
there was no marriage in contemplation of death, there was no
lack of genuineness.

These are all conceded facts, Your Honor.

Mrs. Salfi was turned away without any examination
of the facts of her case.

However, when this case was filed,

the United States, or rather the Social Security Administra­
tion had no hesitation whatever in entering into a stipulation

24
that ail the facts we have relied upon here ware absolutely
true.
That stipulation# incidentally# will bo found —
since there's some suggestion in -the brief of the appellants
in -this matter that 'they did not stipulate to the allegations
of the complaint# I refer you to Appendix page 29# paragraph
25
"There are no genuine issues" — this is the
stipulation
"Thera are no genuine issues of material fact in
dispute concerning the adjudication of the constitutionality
of the challenged provision .. „ and that this three-judge panel
may finally determine tha constitutionality of said challenged
provisions on the basis of the facts set out in the complaint
and affidavits heretofore filed."
To return# if I may, to the issue of equal protection,
just very briefly# a classification# in our view# would be
fatally overbroad if it classified 99 innocent persons with
one malefactor# and punished them all.
Here we have a classification which excludes
thousands of innocant persons right now for the sake of dealing
with the purely hypothetical danger that a fraudulent
application may some day come along. For tin ere is no evidence
in the record# no attempt to produce any evidence that this
conclusive presumption refers to anything which has ever been

25
a problem.
QUESTION;

Would it be fatally overbroad if Congress

eliminated the benefits entirely on 'the theory that they didn’t
want to get into deciding how many people, of the total number,
were malefactors, as you put it?

Well, Congress definitely could

eliminate all widow's benefits.
QUESTION;

That’s very definitely overbreadth,

MR. KATES:

Well, at that point, Your Honor, I

isn't it?

think that Congress would have made a substantive decision
that it didn't want to have widow’s benefits.

26
QUESTION;

Ohat you say is that they can't make

one — they can't try to slice it as thin as they've sliced
it here, when the knife cuts some innocent people?
MR. KATES;

Yes, Your Honor, I think that when the

knife — they've sliced it thin on their side, but very thick
on our side, Your Honor.
QUESTION; Well, what — do you think Congress could,
have made a judgment that a person, a widow, a wife who has
been married for nine months or a year or two years is more
entitled to benefits than one who has only been married for a
day or a week.

And might need them more.

MR. KATES;

Congress might have made that judgment,

Your Honor, but Congress didn't make that judgment.
QUESTION:

Well, what if they didn't but they

could have?
MR. KATES;

That doesn't have anything to do with

our case, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, it doesn't

protection terms, you could dream up a good reason for a law

MR. KATES:

Well, Your Honor, —

QUESTION;

— and you saved the law with it.

MR. KATES;

I can only say with regard to that,

that -that would, as to the children's benefits, make this
statute a redundancy,

A stepchild must prove by actual

27

evidence that he has been supported by the stepfather.
a requirement under the Social Security Act.

That’s

A widow, on

the other hand, has never been required to prove dependency.
That's simply not required by the Act.
And —
QUESTION!

Well, I would suppose, arguably, Congress

could have decided that wives who have only been married a
short time are more competent to take care of themselves if
their husband dies than if they had been married longer.
MR. KATES: Well, Your Honor, if it had, that would
itself have been a conclusive presumption that would have
raised certain problems.
I would point out that with regard to dependency
this is in our brief

a woman becomes dependent not nine

months after the marriage but at the time of marriage
QUESTION:

Well, that’s legally, yes„

MR. KATES*

Not just legally, Your Honor? factually.

If she’s going to give up her job, that normally occurs
before the marriage and honeymoon.

Certainly if she loses

alimony or welfare or pension benefits from a past marriage,
she loses them on the data of th© marriage, not nine months
thereafter.
QUESTION: But if she quits her job at the time she’s
married and tries to go back to that or a similar job a month
afterward, she’s going to have an easier time than if she*a

28

been off the market for a year# wouldn't she?

MR. KATESs
QUESTION:

Marginally# Your Honor# yes.

But —

Wall# isn't Congress entitled to take

into consideration these kind of things that you say are
marginal# when it's drafting anything that is as much of a
tapestry as the Social Security Act?
MR, KATES:

Well# Your Honor# I would concede that

Congress would be entitled to take these things into consider”
ation.

Our argument is that in the light, of the statute# as it

exists# in its position, vis-a-vis the other provisions of the
statute, Congress didn't arid could not have been considered to
be considering those factors.
If it had# it wouldn't have bothered imposing tills
nine-month requirement for stepchildren at all# because that's
already being tested directly by the Act.
You don't need a wide overreaching conclusive
presumption when you've already tested the matter directly# and
if Congress had desired to test the matter as to widows# it
would simply have required widows to prove that they had
become dependent upon their husbands,
I will pass now# if I may# to the issue of sovereign
immunity# as raised by the United States,
Before undertaking a discussion of the technical
aspects of that doctrine, however# I'd like to make one
general consideration clear.

29
This case is very different from those previously
dealt with by this Court, which have dealt —- have concerned
attempted to enforce contracts against the Treasury or attempts
to require or prevent the disposition of unquestionably
sovereign , property.
The Social Security trust fund is not only entirely
separate from the general Treasury, it receives no funds from
the general Treasury.

The Social Security trust fund is

stocked purely by contributors, contributions from wage
earners and their employees — employe?:?, I'm sorry.
The federal government collects, invests, and
distributes these funds, but it does not make any contributions
on its own.
QUESTION: So far.
MR. KATES:

So far.

Yes, Your Honor.

In other words, it acts conceptually as no more
than a trustee.
To hold that the government has sovereign immunity
from a suit, by wage earners to a fund which they've contributed
to and the government has not would be to go far out of our
way to extend the doctrine of sovereign immunity, a doctrine
which is almost universally deplored by modern thinkers as
t

a grotesque anachronism from the Middle Ages.
There is yet another prefatory comment I'd like to
make before going into the general discussion of sovereign

30
immunity, and that is — well, first of all, let ms make one
tlning very clear.

We’re concerned here not with sovereign

immunity froin this suit as such, but only with sovereign
immunity as to benefits hack ~~ benefits for the class back
to the date of original entitlement.
Now, there's an important issue in that regard which
may have been lost sight of completely, since SSA has
studiously ignored it.
This is that there's an SSA regulation which requires
exactly what w© got in this cases

retroactive benefits.

Whenever an application has been found to have bean
improperly denied, that regulation is 20 CFR 404.957, and it is
quoted in our brief, in a footnote.
QUESTIONS

Is this an argument that is made as a

waiver of sovereign immunity?
MR. KATESi

No, Your Honor •— well, whether it is

QUESTION;

Tantamount to it, or what?

3.

MR. KATES;

whether it is a waiver or not, we

believe that the Court was entitled to an order

to order,

and its order is entitled to be affirmed, in so far as it
simply requires the Social Security Administration to treat the
members of the Salfi class the way it would treat anyone
else who came in and showed that they had erroneously been
denied benefits.

31

QUESTIONs

Because, I gather, you say here if

SSA had admitted it had made a mistake in -this ease, then the
operation, of that regulation would have paid these benefits
bac’c to the date of Mr. Salfi's death?
MR. KATES:

Yes, Your Honor, it vrould pay back to

four years, and that would of Course handle -the Salfis, it
would handle, an appreciable number of the class, although it
would not handle all the class, which is six years back.
QUESTION:

Are there any members of this class who

have not -** would not have been in compliance with section
402(j)(l), the one that limits it to a one. year before the
application?
MR. KATES;

I would imagine that there — according

to the estimate of SSA, which we accept, because we have no
facts on the matter, although X don't know how they came about
theirs? there are 20,000 members of the class, approximately,
over a six-year period.

Presumably a substantial number of

those class members are before that six-year period.
However, most of those members would be covered by
this four-year period of the SSA regulation.
Now, let me, for a moment, consider that SSA's
estimate 'that paying benefits back to the date of entitlement
for the class would cost $35 million.
that estimate at all.

Me do not agree to

We note that it’s based on an unverified

assertion in an affidavit, which utterly fails to specify how

32
these figures were arrived at, except in so far as it’s
obvious that they were arrived at by pure speculation,
because no one can know this matter.
Noe on® actually knows how many of these applications
were put in at all.
Moreover, the affidavit assumes what is totally
false, which is that everybody who has been turned down in this
group of 20,000, even if notified, is going to reapply.
Some of these people are dead.

Others may, for various reasons,

not want to apply.
Moreover, it also assumes that all of these people
will be entitled to benefits.

Some of them will not be

entitled to benefits, for a large number of reasons, including
the fact that they're not, as Mrs. Salfi is, 50 years of age
and disabled, or -that they’re not less than GO years of age?
or they may be entitled — Mrs, Salfi, for instance, because
she’s on disability, gets a certain amount of Social Security
benefits anyway.

So her entitlement is not to a full survivor­

ship benefit but to a survivorship benefit discounted by the
amount of her Social Security disability.
The same would apply to anyone who is on Old Age or
Retirement benefits,
SSA has naturally seised upon this figure of $35
million as representing an exorbitant award to -the class,
which will menace the liquidity of the Social Security System,

33
QUESTIONs

Wouldn’t there be a reduction in

benefits if Mrs. Salfi were working and earning —
MR. KATES:

I believe there would be, YourHonor.

QUESTION:

— as the sane that we had in Wiesenfeld,

a dollar for every two dollars earned?
MR. KATESs

Yes, Your Honor.

Of course, if she

were able to work, if she weren't completely disabled, she
wouldn't be on disability and she wouldn't be eligible at all,
QUESTION:

Well, in this class there may be many

who had. to go to work, that haven't been getting any benefits.
MR. KATES:

Yes, Your Honor, that's probably true.

And their lack of benefits might even have some
relationship to my comment that

souks

of them may no longer be

around.
In fact, however, even if it's accurate, -this $35
million figure does not represent, an exorbitant return for the
class, it represents $1750 average for each class member.
$1750 to which these people were entitled and would have
received, had they not been deprived by an unconstitutional
law.
More important, the restitution of this amount
does not in any manner threaten 'the Social Security System?
which has a total trust fund, permanent trust fund, of $46
billion.

Indeed, the amount which was denied fch€i class over

a six-year period represents only a little more than one-

34
twentieth of one percent of the amount which was paid out by
SSA last year alone, and last year SSA actually increased the
trust fund because Social Security taxes exceeded benefit
payments by $1.5 billion.
It had been my intention to discuss in some detail
the question of whether, since Congress has, as SSA concedes,
waived sovereign immunity in a 405(g) case, we are allowed to
bring an action under — or our award below is authorized by
405(g) .
SSA says tliat we can't rely on that, because we
failed to exhaust the administrative remedy provided in that
section.
This Court just today in the Wiesenfeld case, page 5,
note 8, has cited and relied upon previous cases which assume
or hold that it is. unnecessary to exhaust this or any other
administrative remedy where the sole issues are constitutional,
or where the administrative remedy which the -QUESTION: Well, I wonder if that's the whole story,
Mr. Kates.

After all, there was a stipulation.

I tried to

get, and couldn't, from Mrs. Shapiro whether tfyey relied on.
that as the reason they never raised this sovereign immunity
question in wiesenfeld.
MR, KATES:

Well, Your Honor, the stipulation —

QUESTION: Well, the fact is they did, and you don't
have a similar stipulation here, do you?

35

MR. KATES:

They stipulated that they had no

jurisdiction to decide constitutional issues.
QUESTION;

That the administrative agency has

no jurisdiction.
MR, KATES:

Right.

They have no more authority

in this case.
QUESTION:

I know, but the stipulation in Wiesenfeld,

I thought went beyond that? didn't, it?
It wss that you don't have to exhaust your remedies
in Wiesenfeld, because it would be futile to do so.
MR. KATES:

Well, they stipulated that it would be

futile, yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

It would be equally futile here.

Yes.

MR. KATES:

Let me

Rut, as a matter of «—

QUESTION: Well, may I ask this:

Do you read 405(g)

as waiving sovereign immunity, whatever its effect may be,
conditionally upon the exhaustion of remedies?
MR. KATES:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, ws do not.

Not at all,

Uhh~hunh.

MR. KATES:

But let me just a moment talk about what

happened in this case.
We didn't exhaust the administrative remedy, but
somebody else did.

Somebody in our class took our pleadings,

put them into an administrative — our pleadings in the

36

district court# put them into the administrative hearing
officer? the administrative hearing officer said:

You’re

talking about the constitutionality of a statute? we have
no authority to decide that matter.
And the Secretary of HEW affirmed that decision.
That is right in the record in this case.
So# as far as we can tell, there is no question that
the exhaustion was —
QUESTIONs

Well# to'the extent that you’re asking

for back payments# you regard the suit you brought as a suit
under 405(g)?
MR. KATES z

Yes # Your Honor# we believe that it is

justifiable under 405(g).
QUESTION:

Because 405(h) says that — because

they've got it misstated# when they talk about# what is it#
section 71 of 42 US ~~ but that there’s no other avenue for
this kind of recovery, except the 405(g) avenue?

We belia/a that it can be

MR. KATESs
QUESTION:

These back benefits, we believe#
Is that still 1331?

MR. KATES ;

The waiver of sovereign immunity in

our — oiir position, Your Honor, is -that it is either of two
things;

either, one, the waiver of sovereign immunity allows

us to bring a suit under 1331 or any other source of
jurisdiction, limited to the Social Security Act? or, two,
the waiver of sovereign immunity allows us to bring a suit
under 405(g) and —*
QUESTION; Well, what bothers me on your first
argument is, in this — to the extent you’re going for back
benefits, is the provision of 405(h), which says that no
proceeding shall be brought under — I’ve forgotten the exact
language

section 71 of 28 or 42 USC, I've forgotten which

it was — 28, I guess.

QUESTION;

That’s right.

That’s right.

MR. KATES;

— that's what Wiesenfeld was brought

And that would be jurisdictional.

So as it is

considered in the opinion of this Court, this Court didn't
there consider it as a jurisdictional
QUESTION; Well, fortunately, because the government
didn’t raise it, we didn’t have to wrestle -with it in
Wiesenfeld, but I suppose we do in this case, don't we?
MR. KATES:

You may very well, Your Honor.

38
Wow, there’s been a suggestion here that somehow
the sixty-day statute of limitations in 405{g) would apply to
our

class, and that somehow the members of the class avoided

this, or tried to avoid the sixty-day statute of limitations.
Well, I note my time is up, Your Honor.,

I shall

attempt briefly to summarise, if I may.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Have you covered this

in your brief?
MR. KATES;

No, we have not covered tills point in

cur brief«
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
minute to do it very briefly*

Well, we'll give you a

We're running thirty minutas

behind today.
MR. KATES s

Thank you, Your Honor,

The sixty-day statute of limitations is tied very
strictly to the exhaustion requirement*

That's what it grows

out of.
If the exhaustion requirement is inapplicable, the
sixty-day statute of limitations is inapplicable.
The application of that sixty-day statute of
limitations v/orks a very substantial injustice to our class
as well.

These class members are ordinary citizens, who rely

upon SSA for eligibility information, information which is its
duty to provi.de to them.
When these people, the vast majority of whom are not

33
constitutional lawyers, are told that they are flatly
ineligible because of this statute, they’re not going to rash
off and file a suit in the United States District Court,,
They just assume, in justifiable reliance upon the information
they've been given, that they're ineligible.
Having been misled by SSA ~~ misled in good faith,
but misled nonetheless — the statute of limitations should be
considered tolled until sixty days after these people have
now been notified of their entitlement.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Kates.

Mrs. Shapiro, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. HARRIET S. SHAPIRO,
ON BEHALF CF THE APPELLANTS
MRS. SHAPIRO;

The stipulation in the district

court was to the facts, it was not to the jurisdiction.
We contested the jurisdiction in the district court, as we
did here.
The regulation which my opponent refers to,
concerning retroactive benefits — retroactive payments for
four years after benefits tire denied, is designed to recognise
that in individual cases in which errors in adjudication are
noted, the administration can go back and correct those
errors on an individual basis.

That doesn't open up the

possibility of a whole-seals reconsideration that would be

40

tiie ease here.
The other point is that if there were jurisdiction
under 1331, which, as we pointed out in our brief, we don't
believe there is, the members of the class, by my opponent's
arithmetic, who would be entitled to an average of $1,750,
couldn't mo.et the $10,000 jurisdictional amount.
QUESTION:

Well, averages of course don’t make

jurisdiction, do they?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

No, they don’t, but this indicates

that sweeping a whole bunch of people in under the class
action may mean that you have very serious problems about the
individual eligibility of each person.
QUESTION:

Well, didn’t Stanley last year hold

that each member of the clctss had to meet the $10,000 —
MRS. SHAPIRO:

That's right, it did.

And it’s

very hard to know whether any of these, or which ones of
these members of this class — and of course the other thing
that the class retroactivity problem involves is it's going
to mean that the Social Security Administration will have to
determine whether, if you go back for four years you're going
to have to look at month-by“month earnings to determine whether
the individual people were entitled.

And resurrecting those

accounts could be exceedingly difficult.
I believe that's all I have.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Th ank you, Mrs. Shapiro.
