Mr, Chief dtestice

and E;ay it please

the Court;
This is a suit for a declaratory judgment; under
Section 5 of the Voting Rights let of U£5 brought by the
City of Richmond seeking a declaratory judgment that the
voting ehanges resulting from an annexation mads by the City
in 1S7G would not have the purpose or effect of

abridging

the right, to vote on the basis of race.
The annexation added 23 square miles to the city
containing 45,700' and;-some white persons and 1,5 3 (Hand-soma

voters by race.

Of course# prior to annexation# the

population of the annexed territory were not registered
voters in Richmond# could not have been.
MR. TALLAGE
Mr. Justice.

Not in Richmond# that, is correct#

The annexation was the culmination of long

efforts which I recounted in detail in the briefs and which I
won’t take the tir-e to rehearse here.
The reply brief filed by the Appellant City of
Richmond , has the chronology of all the events in this complex
litigation# beginning on page 12# which is quito helpful.
Basically# there were studies that began in the 1950’s
showing a need in the view of many for annexation because of
changes in the composition of the city# exodus of young,
affluent persons.

There are many references that the city

was becoming a place of the poor and the old and the black
end throughout the course of the proceedings there was; a need
for land that could be developed and there was a problem
about the tax base of the city.
After an unsuccessful effort to merer with Henrico
County# the annexation suits were brought in 1961 against both

5
Henrico and Chesterfield Counties.

The one against Henrico

proceeded first and resulted in an award by the annexation
court which the city found unacceptable.

Indications are

because of the heavy payment that would have to be made and
QUESTION;;

There are two ways to annex, as I under­

stand it, on®, by majority vote of both the annexor and the
annexae and the other by court order, special annexation

MR. WALLACE:

That is correct, Mr. Justice.

merger was the former method and while the city

The

voted for

it, the county voted not, so the annexation suits were than
brought and when the Henrico suit culminated in a unacceptable
award, the city proceeded with the Chesterfield suit which
was then compromised and what we have before us is the result
of the compromise.
QUESTION?

Mr. Wallace, are you and Mr. Rhyne

dividing as between issues?
MR. WALLACE:

No, sir, we haven't planned to do that.

1 m going to speak of all -the issues.

The district court

found the annexation invalid in both purpose end effect and
if 1 may, I would like to address the question of effect arc
then the question of purpose and then our view of the proper
disposition of the case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, I have got a reaction that .:

somewhere along the line.

Since the Attorney General now

6
apparently has approved the Richmond plan, why isn't this
moot so far as Section 1973C is. concerned under the Voting
Rights Act?
MS. WALLACE:

Well,

we — we have changed our

position in the litigation of the relative modification:?- of
the plan but that doesn’t rtwan that there has been a sub­
mission to us and we have interposed no objections.

When we

reached our agreement with the city, Mr. Rhyne quite properly
raised that question with us, well, can’t he just new submit
the plan to the Attorney General and we took the position
that it would bo improper for us to abort the-suit that way,
that once the matter was pending in court, ws let the court
decide whether the act has beon complied with or not.
We are a party to the litigation.

How, the question of effect, which is the first one
to address,and the first one addressed by the — our brief —
turns on what dilution must necessarily occur in black voting
strength as a result of the addition that largely white
group to the city’s electorate.
In this case, it was because of that dilutive effect
that the Attorney General refused to grant preclearance upon
the city's submission two weeks after this court's decision
in Perkins against Matthews which made it clear that these
annexations are covered by the Voting Fights Act,

the

annexation had. already gone into effect before the precloaran
was sought and we suggested at the time that if tho dilutive
effect could be ameliorated by changing from an at-large
system of electing councilman to a single-member ward system,
then we would be glad to reconsider and —~

And in the course of the litigation, since the city

brought the lawsuit still seeking approval for the afc-Xarge
system with the annexation, in the course of the litigation,
the city and the United States arrived at a compromise or a
proposed consent decree that begins at page 150 of the
Appendix in which a single-member ward system would foe set up
and in our view, this would eliminate any substantial dilutive
effect of the annexation oh voting for the city council.
It would result in four districts with substantial

crossing the James River, criteria of that sort which are
spelled out in sane detail»
Now# the district court, nonetheless, has taken the
position that the effect is one that is improper under the
act# under what it refers to as the rule or standard of the
Petersburg ease, which is also railed on vary heavily by
the crusade for voters, one of the intervenors here and they
read the Petersburg decision, which was a decision by another
three-judge court, which was summarily affirmed by this
Court, as holding that when there is an annexation of this
sort, the ward plans have to be drawn in such a way as to
minimize any adverse impact on black voting strength, that
the black voting strength has to foe maximised to the extent
possible in the drawing of the ward plans themselves»
We think, thin

is a serious mi trending of the Peters-

fourg case and 1 want to take a minute or two to explain why.

In that case — and I have the opinion here — the
Attorney General, in rejecting the annexation ia

very

similar situation, where there was an at-large council system,
wrote a letter spelling out in detail the Government's
position and that letter is reproduced in the district court;5a
opinion, and we explained that one way to neat the problem of
dilution on the council -- and X am quoting from the letter •

"ouli be to adopt a fairly-dr&vm system of single-iaaisber
wards and tha;; would our position, that it would foe fair

12
representation for everyone in the expanded city that was
required, not an effort at overcompensating black voters
because of the addition of others to the community.
Now, in response to this, the interveners in Peterskttgg argued that oven if this change were made with respect
to the city council, the district court should not approve the
plan in Petersburg?, the annexation, for the reason that the
election of the six constitutional officers provided for in
the Virginia Constitution would not

be affected and the

dilutive effect on the black vote would occur 'in the election
for the city treasurer, the sheriff, the commissioner or
revenue, et cetera.
QUESTION:

The citywide vote, the at-large vote.

MR. WALIjAGEs

That is correct and that was inescap­

ably an at-large vote and the ward plan couldn't do anything
about that.
In rsaponse to

that argument, ass we read the

opinion in Petersburg, the district court said,"the court
concludes —11 and I zm reading from the opinion — :jia
accordance with the Attorney General's finding, that this
annexation can be approved only on the condition that modifi­
cations u:..Icu.L^ted to neutralise to the extent possible any
adverse effect upon the political participation of black
voters are adopted."
That is, that the plaintiffs shift from an at-large

to a ward systam of electing the city court oilmen.

In coming to this conclusion with respect to the
argument of the interveners as to the constitutional officers#
we take note of several factors that the court spelled out
as reasons for not construing the act to block annexations#
in effect,
Now# wo .read that, language to the extent possible
as meaning# with respect to the offices where it is possible

basis on which we filed our motion to affirm in the

Peters­

burg ca:anc vm don't believe that fchiu Court3e affirmance
has endorsed a principle that the district court in the
present case has said that the Petersburg cete stands for#
that there has to be, in effect# a maximisation of black

wards are drawn and what might be —

It is cited in the briefs.

So, basically, we feel that the standard of Peters­

brief indicates that I think it is 867 annexations that have
been submitted to us under the act.

We have disapproved only

We have been operating on the premise that a system of

It

just hasn't — the vote just doe'".n't get out, but

the vote is there and then the city is districted and council
members are to he elected at single-member districts.
It is not argued after that that single-member

is argued that the black voting power has been diluted

We don't think the act retires one method of repre­

QUESTION{

So that although blacks before could

have elected all the council members, the fact that they
could only elect afterwards, assuming bloc voting, afterwards
only five or six of the council members, that wouldn't be a
dilution in your book.
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION;;

Mo, that would not.

That is involved hare, isn't it?

MR. WALLACE:

There might be a racially-discrimina-

tory purpose in making the change, but the effect that thei
districts are fairly drawn would not

be an effect that

violates the act, in our view.

And that is rather involved here because

That is correct.

I think my time is

I just want to summarize very briefly our

position on purpose and disposition and that is that the
record does show legitimate purposes including s ve: •
important affect the deannexation would have oh the school
system in Richmond which is not addressed at all in the
infce rvenors* briefs.
We -think that the appropriate disposition

"'"raid be

to develop the legitimacy of these purposes and whether they

1?
have purged the discriminatory purpose that was shown on
remand.

In the meantime, it has been five years since there

has been an election and We would like to suggest to the
Court Something not suggested in our brief* that it would ba
appropriate if the Court agrees with us that a remand is the
proper disposition on the purpose issue that it would be
appropriate to provide that an election can be held in the
meantime pursuant to the consent agreement proposed by the
United States and the city* an election from these nine wards
with the terms to expire July 1* 1976 so that we would have
a more up-to-date elected city council in Richmond.
I don't think anybody would be worse off than they
are with the old council that was elected in 1970 and on
which replacements are being made without elections by the
existing members of the council,

MR. WALLACES
QUESTION;

it is a two-year term* yes.

Are the elections in odd-number years or

MR. WALLACE;

And the city would prefer not: to wait

until 1976 for the next election and we don't see why that
need occur here.
QUESTIONS

Is the school district co-terminus with

the municipal boundary?
MR. WALLACE:

It is, in Virginia.

MR. WALLACES

It is precisely co-terminus so that fi­

too.
MR. WALLACE:

That is correct.

But the other way around, I suppose the

cases are few and far between sc there is no bad affect but
yet there is a bad purpose.
MR. WALLACE:

We think that this case is a peculiar

example of that.

there has to be an inquiry into whether a 1. .'f foots turococ

We think the answer is fairly clear on the record
as it stands and we are only suggesting the remand as a
matter of fairness because the parties didn't focus on this
issue this way.

Has there ever been a court decision

under this act that said that the effect'was good but the
purpose was bad?
MR. WALLACES

1 ap not- aware of any,

The statute by its terras doe.? require

the state or political subdivision to get a declaratory
judgment to the effect that the procedure does not have the

Really, it is phrased

so that they have to carry the burden, I would think, on
both.
MR. WALLACE:

On both issues.

QUESTION:

That is the language.

QUESTION?

I guess

you would say that you intend

whatever the effects are.
MR. WALLACE:

Regardless of the effect.

Right.

MR. WALLACE:

ted so that issue remains here.

We

think a sufficient, showing was made considering, especially,
that the parties have stipulated that the record in the Holt
litigation is also part of the record her© but we have
suggested the remand only to give the parties an opportunity
to focus more specifically in the issue in this case.

MS. RHYNE:

I represent the City of Richmond.
We ask that this Court approve as its judgment the

contain?.! not only the work plan but the- machinery for ulnool
immediate election, as the City of Richmond feels the sooner
we get back to ballot box control, the better everyone is in
their city.
Now, first of all, let me say.with respect to ,.
question that was asked .about sines 1943 and black partici­
pation in the city council.

22
Mr. Maddox has shown me a piece of paper which is
really set forth in the record, pages 112 to 132, which shows
this:
Since 1948, under the election*"at-’large system,
the citizens of Richmond have elected four, 1 guess it is,
to the council and one has been appointed.
At one time there were as many as three black
citizens on the city council.
QUESTION;;
MR. RHYNE:

On the nizie-member council.
On the nihe-mrmber.

Well, X believe the

record with respect to Richmond, while we talk a lot about
bloc voting and polarisation and everything, these blacks
could not be elected without white votes, because,as
Mr. Wallace bus pointed out, they have never constituted more
than 44 percent of the voting population and the record also
shows, of course, that the whites are generally- much largest
in their percentage of voting than the black citizen.
Bo the City of Richmond, number one, because this
matter has bean here four times already, and this is the
fourth lima, would like to get back to handling, its own
affairs and rat out of court.
Now, with reference to this particular nine-ward
plan, what happened, as the record shows, is that after
IiS^iSSlrii-a held that an at-large election mist .be rap-laced
a ward plan in order to eliminate the discriminatory effect

23
there, the City or Richmond conceded on the record below
that that principle governed Richmond and began working very
intensively to try to con» up with a plan that would satisfy
that standard that would not abridge or deny the right to
vote on account of race or color and so, back and forth, back
and forth, plans went with the Department of Justice trying
to ©chi.eve a plan that would meet with their approval as
having eliminated all possible discriminatory effects of the
annexation and finally, that was achieved and I must tell you,
Mr» Justice Ibhnquist, I thouhgt that when that was achieved,
the case was over because it seemed to rna that under the
statute you can either go to the Attorney ~(5enoral and if hs
interposes no objection, if he approves, in other words, or
you can go to a three-judge court.
Mow, the city was in the throe-judge court and the
Department of Justice took the position that since they were
there that the matter should be presented to the three judgec,

24
Now,- the plan as presented, fch© nine-ward plan,
really allows the black citizens of Richmond fair represen­
tation in the overall of the political processas of the city,
Prior to the annexation? they couldn't elect anyone.
Under this plan, assuming bloc voting, polarisation,
which

I — see, IC don't like to assume.

This is kind of —

I think repugnant to a lot of ideals of a lot of people but,
assuming, then,.the blacks are assured of four seats on the
city council.
Now, as Mr. Holt says ih his brief on page 16, four
seats on the council is really fiscal control of the city
because you can’t adopt a budget without six votes so I think
that this is an enormously-meaningful, fair solution to this
whole problem.
The case, when it come on belew, as we say in our
reply brief, we quote the order, th© three judges said that
the issue was the annexation in Richmond .a© amended by this
four ward plan and then they -- after the re was cere discussio:
about offering evidence on the original annexation, the master
went back to the throe judges and they said, well, you can
let in evidence or the; original annexation.
But to me, completely throughout this whole pro­
ceedings, I thought when the

Attorney General who was rado r

statutory expert under this act, and nearly all of these plans

area passed on to him, they don’t go to court, that when he

25
pi;;t his stamp of approval on this, the case really should
have been ever.
Kgw, time and time again, this Court has said that
you give special deference to tho views of sosraon© who is
charged with the administration of a statute and we quote all
of those in our brief and so here I earnestly believe that
the .attorney General's views below were entitled to more
•weight and more deference than they wears given.

Now, one of the things about the decision below is

that they stated rather peculiar and unusual burdens of
proof after the ca.se was all over with.

They said that because

the city was smeared with a discriminatory taint, it was
up to the city, and there was

an extra burden cast upon the

city to piirge. itself by not oni? proving lack of dilution,
but by proving some legitimate purpose for the annexation.
Well, this annexation started actually in the 1950's
and all through the 1960's there was either litigation or
something going on in connection with it and the record before
the annexation court •— and they have a special annexation
court that hears this — there were 82 witnesses, 9,000 pages
of testimony# 182 exhibits, overwhelming as to the purpose
under Virginia law of the annexation.
They just overwhelmed the court.

The record is

completely one-sided there as to the necessity and expediency
of this annexation and so the annexation gu .....A Ion, as such,

Mr. Derfner*
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARMAND DERFNER# ESQ.
MR. DERFNER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Courts
I represent the Crusade for Voters of Richmond, one
of the interveners here.
We

believe this is the type of case that Section

5 of the; Voting Rights Act is designed to deal with-.

On the

surface# we have a normal annexation purported to ho for
legitimate ends to help a city through some of the problema
that a number of. cities go through in this day and age.

30
On the surface, then, It is like nearly 1,000 other
annexation» that have gone through under the Voting .Rights
Act with no problems.
In fact, though, this annexation was and remains a
deliberate effort on the part of the city to negate the
gains made by black voters under the Voting Rights Act.
When Congress enacted Section 5, added Section 5 to
the Voting Rights Act in 1965, it did so because, as the
testimony in the legislative history shows, Congress well
knew that the history of voting discrimination had been the
inventive development of new stratagems to cope with — to
make certain that white political control was maintained and
that discrimination against black voters was maintained after
the existing stratagems were struck down so that Section 5
was, in effect, a counterpart of Section 4 which mandated the
elimination of tests and devices and, in fact, in Richmond,
what we have is a situation where the growth of black voting
strength, the overcoming by black voters of the history of
discrimination against them which occurred as the *60*8
grew on, especially with the passage of the Voting Rights Act,
was suddenly aborted in 1970 — XSQ9, actually.

It took

effect in 1970.
QUESTION:

On your facts, there was at least one

negro city councilman long before 1960.
MR. DERFNERs

Not to my understanding.

X may ba

31
mistaken.
QUESTION’.

His name was Oliver W. Hill.

MR. DERFNER:

Yes, that is correct,

Mr. Hill was

elected in 1948 or 1950, in the very early days.

After his

one term in office, there was no black councilman until after
the passage of the Voting Rights Act, I believe, in 1966 or
*68 was the next election of a black councilman.
I am sorry about forgetting about Mr. Hill.
The annexation in this case, it seems to be agreed
by everybody with the possible exception of the city, did
have this bad purpose,

Much of the question here turns on

the effect.
Isd like to begin by noting that the effect of this,
the effect of this annexation was, if put in population terms,
to add equivalent of one and a half white wards or on® end a.
half wards of white voters to the city and —
QUESTION:

X& it your position, Mr. D^rfner, that if

the. purpose is bad, you don't have to get to tlsa effect?
MR. DERFNER:

Yes, I do,

your Honor.

The position

of the crusade is that an order -- is that; the act requires
that the city, if it is to gain declaratory judgment, prove
that it doss not have the purpose and will not have the
effect, that both of those are independent busts and that in
the absence
QUESTION:

You don’t suggest that because there was

32
at one time v bad purpose that it is forever bad and incurable,,
MR. DEBTSBR!
QUESTION .’

No, not at all.

Well, and the argument here is that a,

plan or change that originally had a bad purpose and a bad
effect of,the argument is, it no longer has either one of
them because the effect 'has been cured and presumably, the
purpose.
MR. DERFNER:

Well, it is that presumably that

counts.
QUESTION:

That is the argument.

HE. DERFNSR;
That's right.

3u

It is the presumably that counts.

I think that the city, in order to disprove

bad purpose or to show that the bad purpose has been dis­
pelled, must do something i: ora than show some minimization
or seme degree of amelioxisation of the bad effect.

:i think that the Government seems to agree with the
Crusade that *— and with the Court — that there has to be
some independent

proof that -the bad purpose has been

dispelled.

..

One

the its: r of that proof would be a showing

that thn k: ne-s-vti.» has or bad a -- what the court, called,
"an objectively vo ifiabla legitimate purpose” and I think,

33
reason»
I think the Government has highlighted the problem
of the purpose.
draws

2 simply disagree with the inferences it

from the state of the evidence below.
The Government# in effect# says# we think the

evidence below wasn’t clear and we think there ought to be
a new hearing# in effect.
What that means to me is that the city didn't meet
its burden; not only didn't meet its burden but cannot now
show what it would have to show to gain a reversal on that
t

ground.

That

is# that the findings of the special master

and the district court on purpose were clearly erroneous,
that the city can’t meet that standard, that it didn’t meet
its burden of proof in the district court.
Therefore, to me, what the Government is saying is
that, although the city has failed to meet its burden of
proving sound purpose below, it is — it should foe entitled
to a new trial because, really, the Government of the United
States thinks that that evidence might be available to it.
Well, that suggestion of the new trial, I suppose,
is a matter of equity and a matter of procedure to be
deterrinad by the district court below in the first instance,
to be determined perhaps by this Court, on review.
But 2 don’t think there should foa any confusion
about what it amounts to and it seems to me that it amounts
i

clearly to a recognition of the fact that the record below
shows that there isn't any evidence, there isn't enough
evidence for the city to meet its burden of showing an
objectively verifiable legitimate purpose and therefore, with
that being one of the elements, of showing that the bad
purpose has been dispelled.
1 think, as a starting point, what the Government
says amounts to a recognition that the city failed to meet
its burden.
If it failed to meet its burden under the act, there
is no choice.

The district court did not have the right or

the power to grant the declaratory judgment.
Mow, there has been a lot of discussion about the
affect and about what is the consequence of the city's
adoption of the nine-ward system.
I'd like to begin it by a brief reference to the
question that has coma up for the first time todayf that is,
what is the — what is the legal consequence of the Attorney
General's acquiescence or his agreement that a particular
form of submission or consent judgment is appropriate.
QUESTION:

Was this

issue ever presented to the

three-judge court as to whether or

not the Attorney General’

agreement ousted the Court8 s power?
MR. DERFMERs
«u.1.1 sense.

I don’t think it was presented in any

My recollection is that —

35
QUESTION 4

That is one of the questions presented

ll© i"Gi

MR. DERFHERs
your Honor,

My recollection •— I understand that,

Mr. Justice White.

My recollection is that the

city prepared the plan and prepared a cover consent judgment
which it circulated that the Attorney General and his
representatives signed that the representatives of the two
interveners did not sign, that the city then submitted the
matter —* submitted that judgment as a proposed consent
judgment to the district court and that the two interveners
filed brief memoranda saying that they didn't agree and
thought it should not be accepted since it did not have the
consent of all parties in the case and as far as I know, that
was the end of the matter.
There was no legal argument nor any memoranda nor
any further effort by the city to argue that point.
I would say this on that, subject, that I think the
structure of Section 5 was initially exclusively

initially

created in exclusive remedy for the. city in the district
court by declaratory judgment, that during the hearings in
the Senate, as I recall, Attorney General Katzenbach was

asked, wouldn't this be a great burden for a number of changes
that coi-Id be quite mittor?
,kvi ,ie acknowledged that it pn;bahXy urala be ani

36
the Gove ornent cane back, or the legislative draftsmen of

the

Jus?tics Department came Lack, with the provisio which is now
in Section 5,.
It waa initially understood.* I believe, that the
provisio would be a limited remedy and that the declaratory
judgment would be the predominant one.

As it has happened.

mechanically, it has gone the other way around.
QUESTION*

But, surely, the statutory language gives

no intimation of that sort of a legislative purpose but the
consent of the Attorney General is valid only in the case of
some things that are covered by the declaratory judgment
portion of the statute but not all of them.
MR. DERFMER;
Georgia case —

But fch.ii. Court, in Georgia — in the

made it clear that the Attorney General

•operates as a surrogate for lrr court, as a 'iubstiUita, if
you will and I think it would be improper to say that the
surrogate can swallow up the court once jurisdiction of the
court is attached.
I would also remind the Court of its brief reference

in the Allen case, the vary first case dealing with a avivrrdosion under the Voting Rights Act or with a question ox
whether something had. to be submitted.
There, the Attorney General of Mississippi arguod,
that we sent this change to the Attorney Gen rcl and xaver
heard anything.

Therefore, we take it that k? has lot that

37
60 days pass and this Court talked about the requirement, the
requisites of formality and formal submission.
QUESTION;

Yes, but if the Attorney General is

given a formal submission

and approves it under the language

of the statute, then there is no action for a declaratory
judgment

in the District of Columbia.
You agree with that, don't you?
MR, DERFNER:
QUESTION;

In the ordinary case, that is true.

What case other than the ordinary case,

where would you find jurisdiction for that sort of an action?
MR, DERFNER:

I don't think that the attorney — well,

I think that the jurisdiction, once it attaches on

the

district court —•
QUESTION:

Well, I am talking about a case where

jurisdiction is never — the Attorney General has approved
and then an action is sought to be brought by someone .else,
presumably, since neither the city has to bring it and the
Attorney General chooses not to bring it.
Under this three-judge District of Columbia declara­
tory judgment statute, who could bring that sort of an action?
MR. P3RFNER:

The only action available at that point

would be an action by a voter, presumably, seeking to review
under either the Administrative Procedure Act or under the
interstices of this act, seeking to review the Attorney
General's failure to object but, clearly, there is no question

38
but that the declaratory judgment court created under Section
5 would not be invoked if the Attorney General — if the
Attorney General's failure — if the Attorney General had
had a submission and failed to object without jurisdiction
having attached.
But it seems to me that once the court's juris­
diction had attached,, we have an entirely different matter.

The voter, even if the Attorney General

had approved, would still, under the last sentence, have ail

essentially, a cavings 'clause to make it clear that in any
case, it could not be ousted.
QUESTION:

MR. DERFNER:

But it seems to me that it is • ix te

wrong to read the statute as s aying that the Attorney
Genera 1 can, to 'use the colloy uialism, "pull the plug

created by Congress —
QUESTIONWhat if the only two parties in the case
were — the city brings the case? doesn't it?
MR. DERFNER:
QUESTION-

Yes.

And who does it sue?

MR. DERFNER:

It sues the United States.

I am

not sure if it is — it either sues the United States or the
Attorney General.

The practice has been to sue both.

QUESTION:

All right? it sues.

Now, then, let's

assume, two weeks after the case is filed, the plaintiff
moves to dismiss it.

Do you think the court is disempowered

to grant the motion?
MR. DERFNER:
QUESTION

No, I think that the court —

What if the city has made a settlement

with the Attorney General and he just moves to dismiss?
MR. DERFNER;

I don't think the court is disem-

powered to.
QUESTION:

I would think you would say that because

the Attorney General and the city have just pulled the plug
on the case.
MR. DERFNER:

No, I am saying I think the? court stio

has at that point — has to review and has discretion.

I

think it is not disempowered to dismiss but 1 don't think the
-ismi t~l automaticaJ ly has to fc liow and " think trio Court

has dealt with —
QUESTION?

Well, the fact is, the city never xnoved

to dismiss in this case»
MR» DERFNSR:

The city never moved to dismiss.

I am

just reminding this Court again of its opinion in the — it
is a pair of opinions, 1 suppose, a pair of decisions in the
New York case in which the rights of the iatervenors have
been a matter of great concern, not only to the courts but to
the Justice Department.

That has been a continuing contro­

versy, but I still come back to the point that :once the
court's jurisdiction is attached and, especially once
intervarors

come in and have been let in with, I might say,

the Justice Department's acquiescence in this case, that the
court cannot simply be ousted by the medium that might well
have oeen available or would have been available a vi the
court's jurisdiction ever attached.

MR. DERFNER;

But as to the constitutional issue,

QUESTION
MR, DERFNER:

ways
Let m.a direct myself in the time

remaining to the question of effect.

X think unquestionably

th e add i t i o a o f th s s e 4 5,0 0 0 whit© people in -th© contortt of
the population figures that were existing in Richmond, had -«■*
and has a diluting effect.
The question
overcome and I think

- how that diluting affect Is to ba

x thank what the Petersburg oas-a >said

43
axict the way the district court here read the Petersbvtrg case#
is that if we have no discriminatory purpose, you can over-you can meet your burden as to effect by making a good faith
showing that you have minimized the dilutive effect to the
extent possible or to the extent reasonable.

It is something,

I suppose, of a reasonable man standard.
I think the district court here was suggesting —
I think there are two things that are different about thin
case.

First, I think, as the district court suggested in

footnote 46 of its opinion here, there may

well be a differ"'

ent standard as to how far one must go in ameliorating effect
where there has been and is a discriminatory purpose.
In other words, it may be that the phrase "eliminate
dilution" is appropriate in a discriminatory purpose case,
whereas the phrase, "minimize dilution" would be sufficient
in n nor,. — in a case that lacked a discriminatory purpose
anci, on this, 1 think we derive some support from the majority
opinion in the case of Wright 'erar; city of

Emporia in which

there was a discussion of the ways in which bad purpose' or
discriminatory purpose can infect the effect, either by
heightening the feelings of stigma or by casting some glow
or gloats on the evaluation of the claimed legitimate purposes.
That is one thing, but —
QUESTION:

What is your view of the question I asked

your colleague, if there is a city council elected v-t large

44
and the blacks have a potential majority or an actual majority
and than the city is single-districted so that the blacks can
no longer elect all of the council?
MR. DERFIIER:

I don't think that is dilution because

I don’t think — and in that large an election, the supposi­
tion that you might get all nine or virtually all nine of
the council is, in a sense, a bonus that flows from the
mechanism and to come back from that to —
QUESTION;;

So single-districting as long as the

single districts weren’t drawn to dilute themselves black
power# it would bo all right — wouldn’t they?
MR* DERFNER:

Yes.

Yes.

At least in the ordinary

situation where you were not coming on the heels of an
annexation of this sort..
QUESTION s

yes, yes.

ME. DERFHER:

When you are coming on the heels of

an annexation of this sort, some different standards may
apply.

One that I mentioned is the idea that elimination

rather than minimisation may be required.
A second point I would make, though, is that in this
case I don’t believe the city has

met its burden of proving

that if nine-mbmber plans did meet the effect test — I would
m&nzion, since my time has expired — just briefly that the
city refused •«- I think the record will show this — tie city
refused to consider any other plans once it had its plan

45
drawn and the department’s agreement.

It refused to look at

any other plans although X think it was not only arguably
but definitely under an obligation given the background and
circumstances to find the best plan available and X don’t
think that — the Crusade’s plans were not offered or are not
offered as plans that are, in fact, necessarily better or
constitutional or mandatory or anything like, that, but are
simply offered to show that even undor the city’s pattern,
better alternatives ware availablea
It might be that the proper plan would not be one
that had four black, four white and a ninth district somewhere
in the middle, it might be that the better plan — the best
plan would be one that had essentially no uni-racial districts
or one or two, if that is tho best you can draw given
neighborhoods with other districts being, in a sense up for
grebe.
We simply sought to show tlia;c even under the city’s
pattern that a better plan can be drawn»

We don't believe

that bloc voting is an inevitable necessity.
The pattern has shown that where, in the most recent
elections, there has been some departure from that

because

the .Crusade did support two whites as wall as several black
candidates and I might point out that in judging the question
of enhancement, had this annexation not taken place, the
results

os the 1970 elections, the most recent elections,

46
would show, if we 'kook out the votes cast in the annexed
area, that. Crusade black candidates would have had four seats
who
two whites who were elected, one black/was elected and a
fourth —- a second black, a fourth parson who was elected in
the old city but who was not elected because he didn't finish
high enough in tha annexed area.
I think by a variety of tests, the city didn't meet
its effect test, it didn't meet its purpose test and I'd like
to advert just very — for 30 seconds --- to the Government's
suggestion of an electiono
We, too, believed that an election would be highly
appropriate, that it has been five years since an election
has taken place.

But what the Government would have us do

is to have the plan which the city was not able to show
satisfied the Voting Rights Act, have that put into effect,
have what amounts to a back door or side door disposition of
what it coviId not obtain through the front door and, since
the upcoming decisions will be — will involve many that
affect the future course of the City of Richmond and this
annexation, I think that if it is not proper to have an
election of that sort, if we are to have an election -- and
there are many good reasons for having one — I think that,
at least for temporary purposes, it would be appropriate to
have an election in the old city conducted under the old
system.

47
I realize that raises significant 14th Amendment
problems but 1 think we are in this situation -- we are in a
very peculiar situation.

I think peculiar remedies may foe

called for.
This case does not involve — the decision of the
district court does not mean that annexations of legitimate
sort by cities legitimately and honestly seeking to meet
their problems are in any way hampered.
What this case involves is simply the appropriate
action or the appropriate impact of the Voting .Rights Act, of
Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act on those changes which,
like this one, it was designed to deal with.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't one of the legitimate problems

of. many large cities the problem of white flight?

And don’t

you -- is it totally ruled out under this act -~
MR. DERFNER:
QUESTION:

No, no.

-- to take that into consideration in

trying to get more white people into a metropolitan area
where the thing is rapidly tipping?
MR. DEHFNER:

1 don’t think that.

No, I don’t think

that is ruled out, but I think in this case what we had was
much, much more.
Any amiexation that Richmond might undertake or might
choose to undertake after this case is over would, in part,
be based on that goal, I suppose, and that in itself would

4e

not be illegitimate.
It is this particular annexation which Richmond
has sought to clothe in the legitimate garb of annexations in
general that was infected by purposes far worse than the one
that Mr. Justice Relinquish means.
I am sorry I have overgone my time.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Venable.

Would you prefer to begin at 1:00 o'clock and not
divide your argument?
MR. VENABLE:

It makes no difference to me, your

Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

All right, you may proceed,,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF W. H. C. VENABLE, ESQ.
MR. VENABLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
My name is Cabell Venable.

I represent Curtis Holt,

Senior and the class of black voters in the City of Riel?,mend.
Mr. Holt's involvement with this annexation goes
back to before the annexation actually took place.
His first attempt at legal involvement in this case
was a telegram sent to Mr. Justice Douglas, in the fall of
19:.y asking Hr. Justice Douglas to please intercede and prevent vhe annexation from taking place on the 1st of January,
1970.

49
Following that, he spent a year unsuccessfully
seeking tha aid of the Justice Department on his claim that
this was a racially-motivated annexation that did no good
economically or in future growth for the City of Richmond
and had accomplished its sole purpose, which was to prevent
black participation in the governmental affairs of the City
of Richmond.
Failing, and despairing of securing that aid from
the Justice Department, he filed a suit -MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We*11 resume there at

1:00 o'clock.
MR. VENABLE:

Thank you, sir.

[Whereupon, a recess was taken for luncheon from
12:00 o’clock noon to 1:00 o'clock p.m.3

AFTERNOON SESSION
MR- CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr, Venable, you raay

resume.
MR. VENABLE:

Mr. Chief Justice and raay it please

the Courts
Several points were raised in argument toy the
Appellants and Interveners and the Federal Parties.

The

first one dealing with raootness, the moofcness question, I
think, originally raised by Mr. Justice Rshnquist.
I think it is important to point out that neither
the city nor the government, after submitting this attempted
consent judgment, sought the dismissal, nor did they seek
any other affirmative action other than to present it to the
Court.
QUESTION;

Sometimes, of course, we ’.fash those issues

out on our own, as you are probably aware.
MR. VENABLE:

Yes, sir.

I beliave the Government
QUESTION;

You could argue it is jurisdictional.

MR. VENABLE:

Jurisdictional to the Court that the

Attorney General has presented a consent order?
QUESTION:

Well, that the Attorney General and the

city now have agreed.
MR. VENABLEt

I think they agreed as to effecture,

but, Mr. Justice white, I don’t think they agreed as to

51
purpose and that is why the Attorney General went on with the
trial and even suggests today that we gc back and consider
even more the question of purpose,
I think it was only presented on the issue of effect
and that the Attorney General then went on and took evidence
in reference to purpose and even today doesn’t believe that
that focus was specific enough or detailed enough and would
ask this Court to remand back for additional questions on
purpose so it is. not an approval nor is it a failure to
object.
QUESTION:

Wall, you say, in effect, the Attorney

General withdrew from the consent order?
MR. VENABLE:

Yes, sir, I do.

In my brief I made a remark that four seats on the
city council guarantee fiscal

control.

the Court that I am in error on that.

I wish to point to
Five seats can pass a

general approved budget.
It requires six votes for any special appropriation.
So five seats on the council in the City of Richmond is fiscal
control of the city as well as administrative control.
I disagree with the Solicitor General on the statemarvt of this case.

This case goes back to the 1950's and it

goes back specifically to I960 at which time the City of
Richmond attempted to enter into a merger with H-mrico
County,

52

The record shows and the evidence is that the city
limited all of its comments to the officials of Henrico
County to the question that the city was having a fastincreasing black population and they needed more white people.
It is instructive to note that when'the merger vote
was held,

100 percent of all black voter

precincts in the

City of Richmond voted no to merger; 68 percent of all mixed
precincts voted no to merger and the Crusade for Voters wrote
a latter specifying to the Governor and to the press that
merger was a dilution and an attempted dilution of their vote.
Following that time, the City filed two annexations,
■

one against Henrico, one against Chesterfield and let the
Chesterfield Annexation sit on the back burner.
They received an award from the Henrico Annexation
Court of 16 square miles and $55 million and approximately
45,000 people, white people.
They turned clown that award, not, as they suggest,
because it cost too much money, but because they found that
the city charter wouldn't allow them to float bonds to pay
for annexation•

In 1®6

£,

they changed that law in preparation

for the upcoming trial in the Chesterfield case.
In l?Ci, following their rejection of the Henrico
award, secret meetings began .between the city,-.the white
officials of the City of Richmond, specifically excluding
any black representatives, and continued up until the time of

53
the compromise with members of Chesterfield County Board
of supervisors and their county manager.
The entire discussion from the very beginning was,
we need white people.
They discussed politics.

The poll taj* is off.

The

blacks are increasing in their political participation.
They commissioned two political discussions and
analyses of the 1966 and 368 elections which predicted that
the blacks would receive at least four# possibly five seats
in the 1970 election.
Also during this time they tried an end run with the
general legislature of Virginia# something called the Aid:-

••

heiser Commission which sought to allow the General Assembly
to change the boundaries and the vice-chairman went on the
stand# which is evidence in this case# and said# our sole
purpose was to keep the blacks from taking over the City of
/

Richmond.
To quote the 'Mayor, who headed up the negotiations,
“As long as I am Mayor of

the City of Richmond, the niggers

won't take over this town."
TO quote the Mayor again, speaking to another
councilman at a meeting in Virginia Beach, "1 did what I did
in reference to the compromise because the niggers are not
qualified to run the City of Richmond."
And that is the entire focus of the City of Richmond

54
from 1960 and it continues up until today.
To quote the present Mayor of the City of Richmond,
“Once we get e. ward plan/', which he characterized as
reconstructive, "and Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act
expires, we'll hold an at™large referendum and get rid of that
ward plan."
The city has resisted ward plans, single-raessber
districts, from the very beginning up to and including the
time in which it filed the suit in the three-judge district
court in the District of Columbia and maintained the posture
that the original annexation was perfectly all right and atlarge expanded elections were perfectly fine.
It was not until after Petersburg that they even
sought or acquiesced in a ward plan and then what did they
acquiesce in?

A ward plan which the district court below

found in and of itself had a purpose to maintain white
supremacy in the City of Richmond.
How, wa have proposed, as a relief in this case, that
the proper remedy is the. annexation.
the District Court of Columbia»

I have proposed this in

I proposed it in what, is

known as Holt II, which is still stayed, since December of
1971, where wa sought an injunction because the Voting Rights
Act had not been complied with,
I maintained it in Holt I.
Tho problem with that position is that wa have a

55

basic assumption that an award of

deannexafcion in this case

would result in the end of annexation for cities and that
simply is not the case.
An award of deannexation in this particular cass
would uphold the dignity of the Voting Rights Act of 1965,
would serve notice that you can’t go out to "Keep the niggers
from taking over municipal government" and serva that purpose
well.
It would not prevent cities from expanding, as —
as Judge Butzner of the Fourth Circuit so cogently noted,
“divestiture

" his word for deannexation — “would not mean

that cities can’t annex even where annexation would change the
racial percentages of the population.

Well, I know, but X thought you said per

as you wouldn’t say that a singla-member district plan was

get all nine,
MR. VENABLEs

I would not like it but I think in the

QUESTION:

What might you not like?

You might not like what?
MR. VENABLE:

I would not like the change of an at-

.r the context of your first questions, I

believe, earlier today, that where black citizens have played
the democratic process, have given it adherence, to the whole
concept of work within the democratic system and have worked
ht^rd to gain their political position, to have that rug
jerked cr.t at the last minute , just when they were within
grasp of political control, J. think would violate all the

57
standards oil fair play in the democratic process but# in
answer to your question, in the pure abstract, going from an
at-large to a single member is not, per se, dilutive.

But

you have to look at dilution in the context within which the
change occurred»
Now, in the case of the City of Richmond, going from
a ward plan — I mean, from an at-large to a ward on the
heels of what has to be the most classic case of out and out
purposeful

disenfranchisement, in that context, 1 believe

that a ward system does not cur©, nor even approach, the
question of purpose or the question of effect, oxpecially the.
'ward plan prepared by the City of Richmond.
The Court, in dealing with that question of the
burden of the city, it is characterised by Mr» iliyn© as the
city, that that in an extra burden.
Actually, 1 think what the court is doing is relax­
ing the literal interpretation of the act, which says you have
got two burdens.
You have got to prove no purpose and you h&va got to
prove no effect.
What the court is actually doing in that case is
saying, there is an exception to that rule.
There ie an exception to a literal interpretation
and :: think the reasoning goes like this:

That it you ha-oe

8. Vv-.*rxa.;..ably-ob; je cuive, legitimate annexation, it servos nil

58
the races of that community.

It serves all the overriding

governmental needs and purposes.

And if it is objectively

verifiable, then, and only then, do yon corae back to a
Petersburg approach and seek to eliminate as much as possible
any of the dilutive effect because if you can eliminate the
effect, there is no need to send it back because you are
harming the entire governmental structure in so doing.

QUESTION;;

In what ward?

MR. VENABLES
QUESTIONS

Only limited to the old city?

MR. VENABLE:
DISTICH"

In the old city.

Yes, sir.

At large?

MR. VENABLE-:

At large in the old city.

The problem with this case is that it comes and has
come before every court in a posture that was never envisioned
by the Voting Rights Act.
It was envisioned by the very clear language that
no change will be implemented unless it has boon prior
approved.
Now, whether or not the prior clearance situation in

59
agreeable, the fact is, that is what the lavr says and yet
the city implemented this change, waited over a year before
it sought approval, was rejected within a year and a half,
only five days from a motion for summary judgment in Holt II
did they ever go to the district court, and have never really
made a formal submission since the beginning, since the very
first submission.
So what we are dealing with is a fait accompli, as
opposed to dealing with what this act was supposed to bo all
about, to shift the burden.
QUESTION.-

It wasn't all that clear that it was

about annexation fit the time this annexation took place,
was it?
NR. VENABLEs

I would agree with you, Mr. Justice

Rehngu.ist, except for this facts

uncontrovertibly — and I think all parties actedt — that the

to my mind ~~ whether, you know, yow had to reach the results

X think a fair-minded

lawyer could conclude that an annexation was not within the
statutory language.
MR. VENABLEs

Be that as it may, the fact remains

that once it was clear — ones it was clear, what did the
city -do?

It made a submission.

their submissions.

Mr. Kelt and Crusade mad©

It was objected to.

What did the city do from that point forward?
Nothing.
It took a motion for summary judgment hearing to
bring them all the way to Washington in the District Court
of Columbia seeking approval and they sought approval for the
original annexation and not approval for some ward plan.
Now, 1 think one thing that has been missed here
today in our argument is that not only is the purposeful
original annexation at issue, and its effect and impact, but
what about the ward plan?
The court below found that the ward plan itself
operated as a purposeful device to maintain white supremacy
and control in the City of Richmond.
Now, the fact of the. matter is, that tha city did
not carry its burden on any point in the lower court because
it cannot ca
of the'

• burden in the lower court.

The objective

verifiable legitimacy of this annexation, all the

61
Government —• and the Government and the city’s arguments
deal v?ith, well, this is the consequential, incidental
result of the legitimate annexation,»

The evidence is replete,

I do not agree with the Solicitor.General.

Prom the very

first day of Holt X, which is swallowed up in this case, the
entire thrust of the Holt intervanors has been that one of
the most glaring examples of why this annexation is a had
annexation is; that it serves absolutely no Governmental
purpose»
The Government and the city say, the courts recog­
nize that annexations are inevitable.

X will assent to that.

But not this annexation was inevitable.

To approve by remand or otherwise, this annexation
would allot the City of Richmond into the worst possible
annexation it could ever have, economically, administratively,
racially and would serve notice that there in a way to avoid

Yes, sir, I r«\u

ME, VENABLE•

No, sir, it was not.

What happened

below was that the Court merely said, your application for a
ueclaratory judgment is denied,

Slioy then went on to Bay

62
ibat Mr, Holt's request for deannexation had considerable
merit, took note of the fact that Holt.XX, which is as
referred to, that is the Voting Rights case in the

Eastern

District of Virginia which is pending the decision of this
where
Court / v;a are asking for ah injunction on the question that
it is covered, hasn’t been approved, that they, knowing the
local nuances of ouch -an- order --- the mechanics of the
deannexation .order — would be the proper one

to carry it

out.
In-other words, if we deny the declaration, then the

coverage question comes into £©c*>j.
Has it been approved?

No.

Is there coverage?

Yes*

Therefore it must be enjoined mC

that court could then have the machinery rather than the
District Court of Columbia to carry it through,
had
I/also suggested ..that the state court is still in
force, ' the annotation court, by agreement of the parties, the
city and the county, which also could be used an an arbiter
for any problems.
Deenucxatioa is a vary reasonable rsKsey.

The problem is, however, ths.c like in Allan,

63

everything is here.

No more can really he said.

Perhaps

the statement of this Court in affirming the District Court
of Columbia could state the effect of its ruling.

Because

I foresee* very sincerely, that we will go back, if the lower
court is affirmed, as 1 think it must be* and we will go back
to Holt II and we will then have to fight the question of
coverage and whether or not that court has more jurisdiction
than this Court, granted it in the Allen case, which is to go
into substance.

MR. VEM&BLEs

Was there a reason at the time I did

Yes.

MR. VENABLEs

Yes, sir* because 2 felt that it wasrd

necessary* as under Allan* where there was not a question of
cross-petition * this Court said * we will — we could sand it
back but everything in here.

We can grapple with the problem

now and issue a ruling and then send it back

consistent

with that.
What 1 cm asking this Court to do is to grapple witi­
the remedy and send it back consistent thereto.

I 'think

Itearmsxatioh is an eminently reasonable -— and under the
facts of this case, it requires no great time.
Yen are talking about having immediate ©lections.

this deannexation could occur in 30 days, by all the evidence

. MR, RHYNEs

Mr, Chief Justice and may it; please the

Court;
Thera is an

error on page 5? of our brief that I

would like to correct first of all,

We refer there in the-

last paragraph, to the median family income of $12,400 in
the annex area, to $7,692 median.income in the remaining part
of the city and than on down four linea from the bottom, we
say, those with median family income under $20,000,

That

should be under $4,000, which is the poverty level.

MR. RHYNEt

Change $20,000 to $4,000.
To $4,000,

Now, I would also, because ary iintiaguishaci ■nolle
Mr* Wallace, has called my attention to it several times,
out mat tile Government does not tales the pc?sition here
that there isn8t evidence — and overwhelming evidence —* te

support, the fact that the city does have an obj«activelyverifiable —• verified legitimate reason for retaining the
annexed area and they say that in their brief on pages 30 to
35 so that they agree that the evidence is there.
The only reason they mde reference to a possible
remand was to lean over backwards in case someone might come
up with something else.

But they feel that the best solution

of this is tc got on with the election.
, Now# on purpose# I think wa ought to ha fair about
it.
QUESTION»

Now# to get on with the election# every­

body seems to agree about that, but — in his way, but
Mr. Venable just told us# when he was talking about that#
he was talking about getting on with an election and confining
the electorate to the old city.
Now, what sort of —- getting on with what kind of
an election are you talking about?
MR. EHRibij

.‘Y

election ussier Pic sosr-wc:Y! plan

which we feel is the only fair election wh exa the black
citizens of Richmond will have full representation and
participation in a political process because they are there
guaranteed four seats.
Now, with reference to

deannexation, Kr. Justice

Stewart and Mr, Venable, I would call attention to the fact
that the Crusade, in their representation to fc'ia three-judge?

66
court below — and v;q have quoted this on pages two and three
of our brief ~ opposed deannaxation, said that this would
leave the city an empty shell, a worn-out shell and it
wouldn ' t have the room or financial resources to provide a
good life for its citizens.
It would also instantly transform the

schools from

a black majority system to a virtual black system.
So I would seek very earnestly that deannaxation,
other than Mr. Venable, everybody agrees is a bad remedy and
we sincerely urge that on purpose, that Mayor Bageley was the
only one who was quoted throughout and Mayor Bageley has been
off the city council now as mayor since 1970.

H© has nothing

to do with this ward plan,
There are only two people left on the council who

were on there at the time of this bad-purpose settlement and
these people have worked awful hard to bring this about.
are not bigots* or racists in Richmond, Virginia.

Thoy

blacks who take -part in their city government.

The Government is obviously satisfied that there is

or agreed to this

Well, don't you have to persuade us that

MR. RHYNE:

And we urge that it is, your Honor.

evidence is overwhelmingly against that finding.

The

The mere

fact that the Attorney General agreed to it is some evidence.
In the. other evidence on the ward plan is such.

It

is only this so-called Hextra burden” and the economic thing
where they say we didn't satisfy it.
just what the extra burden was.

They never have told w

So we met our burden over-

whelmingly and ?m — with th© Attorney General — presented
this nine-ward plan.
So I — and X think that all the. evidence there was
in support of this plan and proved that the city now, in
connection with this plan, doesn't have a bad purpose and
certainly, the 'ward plan doesn't have a had effect.
It gives everybody a fair participation in th©

that has beer/, all the way up here and the Fourth Circuit
held no 15th Amendment rights were violated by this annexation
but you just go over and over and over it again.
So we urge you to and it*

It can be ended.

They

can have an election within 60 day» ana Richmond can govern
its own affairs and get out of the courts.
That is what we urge the Court to do.
