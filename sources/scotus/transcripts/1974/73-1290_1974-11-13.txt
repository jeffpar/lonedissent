MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Baking Company.
Mr. Friedman, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The Clayton and the Federal Trade Commission Acts
provide a civil penalty of up to $5,000 for any violation
of an order of the Federal Trade Commission,
The statutes further provide that where the
violation consists of a continuing refusal or neglect to
obey the order of the Commission, then each Way for which
the violation continues is a separate offense.
The question in this case, which is here on a writ
of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit,
is whether where a respondent under a Commission order
prohibiting certain acquisitions without the prior approval
of the Commission, makes those acquisitions in violation of
the order each day that the Respondent continues to hold the
illegally-acquired property is a separate offense or whether,
as the Court of Appeals held in this case in conflict with a

decision of the Eighth Circuit, there is only a single
offense

committed in each of those situations:

That is, the

single act of acquisition.
And what happened in this case for these acquisi­
tions , only single penalties of the maximum of $13,000 was
imposed.
In i960, the Federal Trade Commission issued an
administrative complaint against Respondent’s predecessor,
the Continental Baking Company in which it charged that,
since 1952 Continental, which was one of the largest baking
companies in the country, had engaged in what it described
as the continuous practice of acquiring bakeries throughout
the country.
The complaint alleged that 7 specific acquisitions
of bakeries made by Continental violated Section VII of the
Clayton Act and it also alleged that various practices
committed by Continental violated — constituted unfair acts
arid practices in violation of Section V of the Federal Trade
Commission.
After some hearings were held before an examiner,
the case was settled in 1962 through the entry of a consent
order.

The order did two things, basically.
First, it directed Continental to divest itself

of the principal acquisition challenged in the complaint, a
firm called n0mar Bakeries1' which it was believed was the

5
eighth largest bakery in the United States and, secondly,
it imposed a prohibition upon Continental for 10 years
against making certain acquisitions without the authority
previously given by the Commission.
QUESTION:

Mr. Friedman, do you think that that

provision indicates that the Court felt that the holding of
the other acquistions was not improper when it specifically
spelled out Omar?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I'm sorry, Mr. Justice, this is in

the Commission complaint.
QUESTION:

All right.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I don't think that — there was,

let me say, there was a time that they entered into the
consent order.

There was also an Appendix that the parties

signed which they said would provide a basis upon which the
Commission

could determine whether it was in the public

interest to enter this order and in the course of that,
which vras a part of the agreement to settle the case on
consent — arid in that agreement with respect to at least
two of these acquisitions they concluded that it was not a
violation of the Act,
But I don’t think the fact that the Commission
limited the divestiture to Omar to be fairly viewed as any
indication that it concluded that the rest of the acquisi­
tions were not illegal.

This was a consent order and this

r'

o

was a settlement.

They agreed to give up the major

acquisition they had made in return for which the Commission
allowed them to keep some of the others and they both agreed
to include this ten-year ban on further acquisitions.
That provision is set out at pages 88 to 89 of the
record and what it says, "Directed the Respondent to cease
and desist for ten years without the prior approval of the
Commission from, acquiring, directly or indirectly, through
subsidiaries or otherwise, the whole or any part of the
stock, share capital or assets of any concern, corporate
or noncorporate, engaged in any state of the United States in
the production and sale of bread and bread-type rolls."
Now, as I have indicated, the agreement which the
parties signed consenting to this order stated two things.
First it stated that in construing this order,
any of the parties could properly — the Commission and the
parties could properly refer to the complaint itself and the
two provisions of the complaint that we think are signifi­
cant in determining the purpose of this ban on acquisitions
for ten years without prior Commission approval — one of
the allegations was that, as a result of these acquisitions,
Continental had eliminated the acquired bakeries as
independent, competitive factors.
The other thing that the complaint referred to was
there xvas a substantial trend to industry-wide concentration

in the baking business.
These two allegations are set forth at pages 67
to 68 of the Appendix.
Now3 in addition, there were certain things stated
in the Appendix which was made a part of the agreement on
the consent order, which bore on what the Commission was
thinking when it approved this order, and the reason for
that is the parties stipulated that these were factors that
the Commission could consider in determining whether it
would be the public interest to adopt this consent order
and at page 8ts which is the end of the Appendix, I’d like
to read just two sentences just before the first full
paragraph.
The party said that, "If this order is adopted
by the Commission, the Respondents’ alleged continuous
practice of acquiring companies baking and selling bread
and bread-type rolls will be brought to a halt and the major
acquisition forming the gravamen of the complaint will be
undone.
"Competition may be restored essentially as it
existed before the acquisition of Omar, Inc. and the public
Interest will be well-served."
Now, it seems to us rather clearly what the
parties Intended this order to do is two things.
One, to bring to a halt the alleged practice of

8
Continental of increasing concentration by acquiring one
bakery after another.
And, secondly, to undo one of the principal
adverse effects on competition resulting from the acquisi­
tions by acquiring divestiture of the major acquisition, the
Omar Bakeries.
This order was approved by the Commission in May
of 1962 and in 1966 the Commission undertook an investi­
gation to determine whether certain conduct by Continental
violated the order.
Specifically, it looked into three transactions
which formed the violations involved in this case.

The

transactions are substantially similar.
In each case, there was an independent bakery
which previously had both produced bread and rolls and
distributed it and in each case, the independent bakery
agreed, in effect, with Continental, that it would give up
its production of the bakery products and would, instead,
distribute to its previous existing customers, the products
that were made by Continental.
In other words, Continental, in effect, took over
the routes and provided the bread for these customers that
had previously been the property of the independent customer
The stipulated facts in this ease on the basis of
which the District Court decided it are that the independent

9
bakery distributed these products of Continental exclusively
under Continentalrs name over the same routes and to the
same customers that it had hitherto distributed its own
product and 3ince there is a question here as to whether
this was an acquisition of assets, I think it is not
insignificant that each of the written agreements under
which Continental took this over are captioned "sales
agreement."
After investigation of these transactions, in
1968 the Federal Trade Commission certified the case in
accordance with the statute to the Attorney General, asking
that penalties be sought for these three violations of the
order.
In the interim —- and the complaint was filed in
December, 1968 — In the interim, in September of 1968,
Continental Baking was acquired by the present Respondent,
ITT Continental, a wholly-owned subsidiary of International
Telephone and Telegraph.
The Government’s theory upon which it sought
these penalties was that these transactions violated the ban
and the order against acquiring directly or indirectly the
whole or any part of the assets of a bakery firm.
The District Court held that two of the violations
violated the order, but that the third one didn't.
The Court of Appeals affirmed the finding

of

10
two violations, but disagreed with the Court of ■— with the
District Court as to the third and held that all three of
them violated the order.
I think the rationale of these holdings is well
set forth in the District Court's findings.

It said -- this

is at page 14a of the Appendix to our Petition.
It said, "Particularly in businesses where route
salesmen are involved,

customer lists have a peculiar

value and that they frequently represent the principal
assets of a business."
It said that "In connection with these transaction^
the most important assets that Continental acquired Were
the sales routes and sales volume," and in reversing the one
transaction that the District Court had held did not violate
the order, the Court of Appeals said that the market —■ that
is, the customers and the volume -- the business of
distributing the bread was acquired and this was a principal
asset of the bakery.
This determination reflected one of the facts
stipulated in the District Court, which is at page 31 of
the Appendix., that "Route books and customer lists are
asset of any person, firm or corporation engaged in the
distribution and sale of bakery products.,,

The complaint in this case sought penalties of
$1,000 a day lor each of these three acquisitions for- each

11
day that they held them from the time of the acquisitions
and the transactions until the filing of the complaint.
The District Court rejected this claim, ruling
that this was not a continuing violation within the meaning
of the penalty provision, but was merely a single violation
and assessed a penalty for each of the two violations, the
maximum statutory penalty of $5,000.
What the Court said is that the order prescribes
only the act of acquisition, not any retention and it said
once these two acquisitions were accomplished, the vio­
lations were complete and the Court of Appeals for the Tenth
Circuit affirmed that holding, saying that the — once again,
the order does not bar the retention of assets illegally
acauired, but only the acquisition itself.
Now, subsequent to the decision of the Tenth
Circuit in this case, in a case which is how Spending on
certiorari called

Beatrice Foods v. United .States, the

Eighth Circuit reached the contrary conclusion.
It held in a very similar situation involving a
dairy, however, and not a bread company, that it was a
continuing

violation and it accordingly approved in the

Beatrice Foods case the assessment of daily penalties of
$200 a day from the date that Beatrice Foods took over the
supplying of milk to the dairy to the point that the com­
plaint was filed.

12
The total violation that was approved in the
Beatrice — the fine, I am sorry, that was approved in the
Beatrice Foods case was $156,000 and in upholding —
QUESTION:

Approximately how many dollars xrould

have been involved here if the District Court and the Court
of Appeals had bought your claim completely?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, if the Court gave us the

$1,000 a day for which we asked, it would have come to
better than a million dollars.

But, of course, we don't

know what penalty it would have been.

If the Court had

given the $200 a day —
QUESTION:

No, but you asked for $1,000.

MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

We asked for $1,000.

And did you ask for $1,000 for each

one of these acquisitions?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes, we asked — there were three

counts, each —
QUESTION:

So that is $6,000 a day for the

MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

$3,000 a day.

Yes. yes, I beg your pardon.

MR-, FRIEDMAN:

$3,000 a day for a period from

1965 to 1966 up to the filing of the complaint in 1970,
which would be a very substantial penalty.
QUESTION:

Well

MR. FRIEDMAN:

over a million dollars.
Well over a million dollars but we

13
do think. Hr. Justice, that that is what Congress intended
in the penalty provisions.
QUESTION:

I know you do and as you do point out,

of course, the Court — the $1,000 is a maximum.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

The $1,000 is the maximum.

That

is ail we asked for but $5,000 is the maximum and not
infrequently the courts, when they do assess penalties,
give less than the government asks for.
QUESTION:

But the $1,000 would

have been a

maximum in this case.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

In this case, yes..

That was all

we asked.
QUESTION:

Mr. Friedman, has the Federal Trade

Commission been imposing daily penalties for comparable
infringements, as it views it, of orders, consent decrees
of this kind, over the past years?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, fortunately, Mr. Justice,

this is a relatively infrequent occurrence, the violations.
There have been very few

cases in which continuing penalties

were sought.
I think the reason — the reason is that in most
instances, these orders merely bar acquisitions without
getting the approval of the Commission and. in most instances,
what happens is, the people come in and seek the Commission's
approval.

If the Commission turns them down, they don't go

ahead with the transaction.
If the Commission gives them approval, they do go
ahead with it so there has been a relatively infrequent
situation.
QUESTION:

Is this the first case or the Eighth

Circuit case?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I don’t know which came first, but

they were relatively simultaneous.

I don’t know exactly

when the Eighth Circuit case —
QUESTION:

So far as you know, these are the only

two cases?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

As far as I know, these are the

only cases involving daily penalties with respect to the
acquisition-type orders.
There may be other cases involving daily penalties.
QUESTION:

Is there any regulation of the

Commission or any other means by which a party might be
notified that the Commission took this interpretation of
the statute?

That is, that daily penalties were appropriate

where an acquisition was made?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

The Commission’s position ■— the

Commission did not give — ordinarily give notice to parties
of this fact and I think the theory of it is, Mr. Justice,
is that the parties are subject to the order.
They know they are prohibited from making

15
acquisitions without getting the approval of the Commission
and the Commission assumes that these partiess if they have
a transaction which is at all dubious, will come in and
answer.
And, of course, in this case, the Commission did
make inquiries of these people and there was an extensive
investigation before the penalty suit liras brought.
But the Commission does not follow the practice
of giving notice.

The theory — I suppose, in a sense you'd

say the theory is that the order itself is notice to them,
that they cannot acquire directly or indirectly the whole
or any part of the assets of a firm engaged in manufacture
and sale of bakery products.
QUESTION:

I understand that, but it does seem to

me, as evidenced by the fact that we are here today, that
it is arguable whether the statute means what the Commission
says it means.

That being so, I was wondering whether there

had been any sort of regulation or notice given in any
other way.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, there is no rep^ulation.

I

would suggest, Mr. Justice, that this is a factor that the
District Court might properly take into consideration in
determining the size of the penalty to be assessed, that
this Court has, of course, discretion to decide how large a
penalty to be assessed.
I would just like to refer to one thing that the

16
Court of Appeals said in the Beatrice Foods case when it
indicated its disagreement with the judgment of the Tenth
Circuit in this case, it said that "Such a limited construc­
tion of the order as barring only acquisition and not
retention, ignores the crucial effects of an acquisition
and would render non-acquisition orders virtually meaning­
less ."
QUESTION:

And that would indicate the Tenth

Circuit case came first, if it is of any significance.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Oh, yes, the Court of Appeals

decision in the Tenth Circuit came first, but I wasn’t —
in answer to Mr. Justice Powell’s question, I couldn’t say
which

suit v/as filed first.
QUESTION:

Now, there —

Well, that wouldn't make it meaningless,

It wouldn’t make the acquisition order meaningless because
I take it that divestiture is an appropriate remedy for a
violation of an acquisition order.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I would think so, Mr. Justice, and

since this case, the Federal Trade Commission Act has been
amended specifically to provide for equitable remedies in
penalty suits but I think what the Court meant was, mean­
ingless in terms of accomplishing the piirpose —
’ QUESTION:

Of the fine.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Of the fine, in terms of

accomplishing the purpose of these penalties to provide

17
enough of a penalty —
QUESTION:

The fine penalty.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

The fine penalty, yes, and, of

course, divestiture isn't a penalty.
QUESTION:

But it hurts.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Divestiture is merely But it hurts.

It hurts, yes.

But I

think that

the fact that someone is subject —
QUESTION:

Well, what of the theory of divestiture

for violation of an order?

Is it because continuing to

hold it violates the order?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Mr. Justice.

It seems to me it must be,

It must be because what you are trying to do

is undo the violation.
The violation was the acquisition and the retention
and the way you undo it is to divest the illegally-acquired-QUESTION:

Because holding it contines to violate

the order.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I would think so.

I think

implicit — implicit in an order prohibiting an acquisition
is that if you make the acquisition in violation of the
order, that is a continuing; violation.
It is all part of one thing.
QUESTION:

I suppose that ail it would take is a

changing a couple of words in your consent decrees, then.
to make it clear.

18
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

Well —

From now on.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, there is a problem with that,

Mr. Justice, from now on.
QUESTION:

Because they xron’t consent.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

67 of them.

They won’t consent and there are

There are 67 of these orders outstanding.

QUESTION:

Well, they shouldn’t — now that they

know what your position is, they shouldn’t consent anyxvay.
MR. FRIEDMAN;
are not consent orders.

By the way, some of these orders
There are a number we have set out

in our Appendix, 10 or 12 of them, that were orders entered
folloitfing litigation.
QUESTION:

Your view of the matter, Mr. Friedman,

is that it is something like a contempt order of $1,000 a
day and you give the contemptnor an opportunity to terminate
it whenever he wants to,
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes, I think the Second Circuit

issue —
QUESTION:

But everybody understands that in a

contempt order without any ambiguity.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Is that not so?

Yes, the Commission's position

the Commission has not included in these orders the xfords
"or retention."

It has limited these orders, both the

consent orders and the litigated orders, to the word

19
"acquisition."
QUESTION:

Well, the issue here is whether this is

a continuing violation.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Because if it is a continuing

violation, the statute is perfectly clear that each day is
a separate violation.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes, that’s the question.

That is

the question in this case and the reason we think It Is a
continuing violation is because of the purpose of the order.
That is, there is nothing wrong with the
acquisition itself.

The reason the acquisition is pro­

hibited is because of the consequences of the acquisition.
The acquisition is the means by which a firm
acquires a share of the market and makes a change in the
structure of the market and what is intended to be prevented,
it seems to us, by both underlying Section VII of the
Clayton Act and by an order of this type, is to prevent the
kind of changes in the structure of the market that result
from acquisition.
And It just seems to us that it doesn’t make much
sense to say, yes, the order prohibits the acquisition and
there Is a penalty for that but once the order Is violated
:*'C '

and the acquisition is made, at that point that is the end
of it.

That is the end of it.

Once you have acquired It, in

20
effect3 you can continue to acquire it because the theory
seems to be it is not a continuing violation.
QUESTION:

But a judge, on the other hand, could

accept your theory and still barely slap a defendant on the
wrist by making it $5 a day.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That might be an abuse of discretion,

I don’t know, Mr. Justice, but certainly the judge has
considerable discretion and all we are saying is that the
judge should exercise that discretion, should not attempt
to limit — not attempt to limit the penalties to the single
$5,000 and view just the acquisition as the offense.
Now, this case, we think, is a very different case
from the Armour decision

on which the courts below have

relied and on which Respondent heavily relies in this case.
Armour, vie think, involved a different situation,
a very different situation from this.

In Armour, the

question was whether the Greyhound Company would have
violated the Meatpackers consent decree by acquiring Armour.
The judgment prohibited Armour from acquiring an
interest in a food company.

Greyhound, according to the

Government’s theory, was in a food company and the
Government’s theory was that even though the language of
the decree only prohibited Armour from having an interest
in a food-packing company, more broadly, the purpose was to
effect a separation between the Meatpackers and the food

21
companies, that the decree was concerned with the relation­
ship and this Court rejected that reading.

This Court said

no, we think that what that consent judgment meant — what
that consent judgment meant was that it banned certain
action by Armour, taken by Armour and

did not ban action

taken against Armour by Greyhound and it is in that context
that this Court used the words which are relied on by our
opponents and by lower courts", that the meaning of a consent
decree must be discerned within its four corners and the
consent judgment must be interpreted as written.
In Armour, of course, the question, basically,
was whether what Greyhound was proposing to do violated the
consent judgment.
In this ease, that is not the question.

The

courts below held that what Continental Baking had done did
violate the consent order.
The question in this case is whether, after the
violation took place, whether the continued holding of the
assests, whether the continued holding of the assets
constituted a continuing violation.
QUESTION:

Well, whether it -— yes, continued to

hold and violated the consent order.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:
didn't.

That's right.

And the courts below held no, it

22
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

That’s right.

Well, Mr. Friedman* supposing I commit

the offense of robbery and take $3.00 from you.

Now, you

would not say that each day I keep your $100 I am
committing the offense of robbery?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, Mr. Justice, but I think that

is a different situation.
QUESTION:

Well, and then the Court could require

me to make restitution, just as you, in answer to Mr. Justice
White said that divestiture could be made, even though a
robbery is a one-time offense.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes, but the restitution, it seems

to me — that is a different thing.

That is to make whole

the victim of the robbery.
But here we are dealing with an order which, it
seems to me, is not designed merely to protect one individual
against the theft of his property.
Here the purpose of the order is to deal with
competition in the bakery business and we think that is a
very different situation.
QUESTION:

But it dealt with it in terms of

acquisition.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

It dealt with it in terms of

acquisition but we think inherent in the ban on acquisition
is a further ban upon retaining any asset acquired in

violation of that prohibition.
That is what we think it is,
I should add two other distinctions, if 1 may,
between this case and Armour.

In Armour, all that you

could go on, basically, was the consent judgment.
Here, what we have is the agreement of the parties
that the complaint can bo referred to and also this
Appendix, which the Commission had before it in dealing
and deciding to adopt the order.
Secondly, all that was involved in Armour was
the Interpretation of the judgment.
to interpret the consent

In this case, we have

order in the light of the statute

specifically dealing and providing penalties for continuing
offenses and we think that the Armour case does not support
the decision below.
QUESTION:

Did I understand you correctly, in

response to Mr. Justice White, that the consent decree
could have been made so clear and unambiguous that there
wouldn't be any question to litigate?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

Well, I —

Except the amount?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, it could have been.

That is,

the Commission could have, instead of using the word
acquisition, could have used the words acquisition retention
and it has not done that, Mr. Chief Justice, and it hasn't

24
done it, I think, because it felt it was unnecessary.

Over

the years it has entered a large number of these orders
containing the same thing.
QUESTION:

Well, did you not give some intimation

or was it from some other source I got the intimation that
if it was made that clear, you would not get consent
decrees.
HR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

You did not.

MR. FRIEDMAN;
QUESTION:

No, no, I did not say that.

I did not say that.

You did not intimate that.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I think perhaps Mr. Justice White

suggested that the Defendants might not consent.
think that this is what this order means.

But we

We think the

notion that someone would say, I will not consent to an
order that tells me that if, despite the ban I violated
in retaining the assets, I am only —- I am not subject to
divestiture or subject to penalties — I find it hard to
believe that the parties to these orders didn’t understand
that what these orders prohibit is certain acquisitions and
an awareness of the fact that if they make the acquisitions
and they keep the acquisitions. they are prohibited from
making their acting illegally.
QUESTION:

Do you have any issue here about

construction of the document according to the authorship?

25
ME. FRIEDMAN:

I don't — I don't think so,

Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

The only decrees I ever had to do with,

except for the Government , were- drafted — all of them that
I had to do with, both for Government and otherwise, were
drafted by the Government, much like a union contract is
submitted.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I don’t know how this was drafted

but I suspect, as is true in most of these judgments, there

was a great deal of give and take.
QUESTION:

On the form?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

But I think we gave --On this part of the —

No, I don't think there was any

dispute.

I think this was kind of what had always been

assumed.

This is what had been done.

There were 67 of

these outstanding, all of which say "an acquisition" and
there is no reference to retention.
And I think it was just the Commission, I am sure,
assumed that this --QUESTION:

But in any event, your point is that

there is no ambiguity to resolve.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That Is right.

We think, fairly

read, the word "acquisition’' Includes retention.
I just want to say one other thing before
reserving the rest of my time for rebuttal.
The Respondent makes three other arguments which

26
it says are before the Court.

They are offered allegedly as

bases for affirmance of the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
Two of them — we've dealt with them extensively
in our reply brief.

We don't think they are properly before

the Court because of the Respondent's failure to file a
cross-petition.
Two of them dealt with the right to the question
of whether or not perhaps multiple penalties are available
but only to the period for which the penalties would run.
That is, whether the multiple penalties would be
available after ITT took over Continental Baking or for the
period after which the Commission had concluded that there
was a violation.
The third contention is that the actions of ITT
in this —* of Continental in this case, the transactions,
didn't violate the order at all.
That issue was resolved against the Respondent by
the Court of Appeals and what it now appears to be saying is,
well, somehow this should be permitted to argue in support of
the judgment that no penalty should have been attached,
therefore, you shouldn’t attach higher penalties.
We think that that is not a pennissable method
of affirming the judgment.

That contention does not seek

affirmance of the judgment.
In effect, it Is reversal of the judgment and. we

27
think the decisions of this Court have made it very clear
there that Respondent can argue points the effect of which
would be to support the ruling below.
That is, you can support these decisions below, of
course, on grounds not given by the Court of Appeals, but
you can’t come in and say we support it on the grounds that
it is wrong.

That is not supporting it.

That is seeking

to overturn it.
QUESTION:

Mr. Friedman. isn’t that precisely

what the Government did in the Audi case at the last
session?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

As I recollect, Mr. Justice, in the

Audi case, it was contended that the question presented
was broad enough to cover the various points that the
Government made.
That was my recollection of it.
QUESTION:

That was the contention.

QUESTION:

That is a nice way to put it.

QUESTION:

As I am sure the opposition is con­

tending here.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Schafer.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. SCHAFER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. SCHAFER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

28
the Court:
What this case involves is an attempt by the
Government to secure a retroactive rewriting of the consent
decree which prevents only acquisitions so as to permit the
imposition of daily penalties in addition to those that have
already been imposed for something that is not barred by
that consent decree.

That is, the retention of assets

acquired.
The Government’s position flies directly in the
face, in our judgment, of the Armour decision of this
Court, the Hughes decision, the Atlantic Refining decision
and our case, I believe, Is a fortiori to those cases
because, contrary to those cases which arose basically in
terns of a construction of those consent decrees, here we
are dealing with a penalty action from which the Government
is seeking, as I say, retroactively, to interpret this
consent decree so as to impose nulti-millions of dollars of
penalties on ITT Continental Baking Company so that the
underlying rationale of this Court’s decision prevents that
and I think that if that rationale is ever to be applied, it
should be applied in this kind of a case where we are dealing
not with a prospective interpretation of the consent decree,
what does it mean, but we are dealing

instead, as I say,

with a penalty action.
The Government’s position and our position would

substantially weaken antitrust and other enforcement
activity because, as we all know, much of antitrust
enforcement is conducted by way of consent decrees and
consent judgments.
That is true of the STC and other agencies as
well.
If we are going to —now, as the Government urges
you

to import into consent decrees vague concepts of

purpose, purpose of the underlying statutes, the purpose of
the consent decrees — you are going to, instead of
resolving litigation through consent judgments, you are
going to foster litigation.
QUESTION:

How do you separate the purpose and

the objective of the consent decree from the underlying
statutes on which it —
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, what

Armour teaches, what Atlantic Refining teaches, and what
Hughes teaches is that you look at the document as it is
written.

It is a contract composed between two opposing

parties designed to do nothing but to eliminate the litiga­
tion.
It

doesn't have any purpose and if it is a

statutory purpose, that is irrelevant when you are dealing
with this construction.
QUESTION:

Excuse me.

Well, even when you construe — even

30
when you construe a contract., even if the lawyers, the
draftsmen have not been careful enough to put in all the
necessary desirable preambless that doesn’t stop the Court
from looking at the totality to interpret the language of
the contract, does it?
MR. SCHAFER:
Justice, in a contract

If there is ambiguity, Mr, Chief
it Is true, of course, under

standard contract lav; it is permissable for the Court to
look at the background of the negotiations.
The Government doesn’t claim any ambiguity here.
It simply wants you because of what; it says is the purposes
of this consent decree, to add some

words to it.

It wants

to add some words to it.
It -wants you to say the consent decree doesn’t
proscribe acquiring, that it proscribes acquiring and
holding or acquiring and owning or any other language you
want to say.
QUESTION:

You are suggesting that as they are

#

reading the consent decree by a defendant would be that you
can make an acquisition, violate the order and at the
maximum, it will cost you $5,000.
MR. SCHAFER:

On this decx-ee, that is a fair

reading, Mr. Justice White.
QUESTION:
the decree,

That Is the sole price for violating

MR. SCHAFER:

No, not the sole price because, as

you pointed out, divestiture is a very real price.
QUESTION:

As far as the fine is concerned, it is

a $5,000 price, that is all, for violation.
MR. SCHAFER:
true.

That would be true.

That would be

The Government can avoid that by writing a different

consent decree.
would be the

But that is true.

The sole- penalty price

$5,000, that is true, now $10,000 under the

new statute.
But you do have divestiture.
QUESTION:

I take it

that you would probably

also argue that if both of you had known this is what the
decree was supposed to mean, the Government would have
written it that way in the first place.
MR. SCHAFER:

They would have —

Unless they are trying to play

tricks on us, I would assume that they would write it that
way, yes.

"

'Vu.-.7

As I say, the Government, in. its.brief, it
didn’t do it today but in its brief it argues that unless
you construe this decree our way, it is going to be a
toothless, unenforceable decree and that is not so.
Not only is the penalty involved, but that really
seems to me tantamount to arguing that

Section VII of the

Clayton Act is toothless and unenforceable.
relief there is divestiture.

The only

No one, to my mind, has ever

32
suggested that Section VII of the Clayton Act is unenforce­
able.
QUESTION:

That is what you were refused here?

MR. SCHAFER:

It was denied.

The Government did

not make a showing warranting divestiture in the judgment of
this Court.
QUESTION:

Could the Government do that again, in

this very case?
MR. SCHAFER:
QUESTION:

Go back?

Could they now make a better showing

and go back?
QUESTION:

Bring an independent action.

MR. SCHAFER:

Ch, surely, they can charge these

were Section VII violations.

Oh, no question about that,

yes.
QUESTION:

And, theoretically they could win it

and get divestiture.
MR. SCHAFER:

That is quite right and they are

arguing and It has been sustained in the courts below that
they don't even have to bring in Section VII in order to
ask for divestiture.
QUESTION:
the essence.

Why can they try that ever?

It is in

They have tried out the divestiture matter in

this enforcement action.
MR. SCHAFER:

Nell, I don’t know if you really

33
would say, Mr. Justice White, that they really tried it
out.

They claim they were denied it, but, in the District

Court’s judgment, they never made a showing on divestiture.
They had it in their complaint.
QUESTION:

If they brought a hew Section VII

action now, I suppose one of your first attempts might be
res adjudicata then.
MR. SCHAFER:

I hadn’t thought it through, but I

think you'd have different issues.

I think you would have

different issues.
Now I should say — let me go, if I may. to the
factual framework of these so-called
are simply supply contracts.
Continental

"acquisitions."

These

These are contracts by which

agreed to supply these former producers of

bread and rolls, that the Continental would supply them
their requirements of bread and rolls and that those former
producers would distribute those breads and rolls in their
trading areas,
They were pure requirements contracts or
distribution agreements or whatever you want to call them.
Mr. Friedman expresses some wonderment that they
are called sales agreements.
ments.

Well, they are sales agree­

They are agreements to buy and sell bread.

That is

all they are.
QUESTION:

But the bakeries acquired agreed not

34
to bake anything more of their ovm.
MR. SCHAFER:
out of a stipulation.

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that comes
We agreed, the lawyers wrote up a

stipulation to resolve this dispute and we agreed to
stipulate that it was the understanding of both sides that
those former producers would stop selling and what that
simply meant was that we knew when we took on the
obligations to supply them, that they were no longer going
to supply themselves.
QUESTION:

We did not bargain for that.
It was a better deal for them to get it

from you than to make it themselves.
MR. SCHAFER:

The economics of the industry are

that the small producer is increasingly noncompetitive.
These three companies in Missoula, Montana, in Cheyenne,
Wyoming and in Durango, Colorado concluded independently
and for their own reasons as stated in the Appendix, to
cease the production of bread.
They did, however, want to stay In the bread
business so they agreed with Continental to purchase
Continental bread and to 3ell it in their trade- areas.
They remained independent, competitive entities.
QUESTION:

Where does Continental make the bread

that It supplies to Missoula, and Durango and Cheyenne?
MR. SCHAFER:

The Missoula bread came out at

Spokane bakery, Spokane, Washington.

The bread for Durango

35
and Cheyenne came out of Its Denver bakery,
These companies remained independent, the soleomed companies.

They owned their own assets.

their own trucks.

They owned

They hired their own personnel.

They

owned their own sales routes, their customer lists.
They owned all their assets.
appointed by Continental.

They were not

There was nothing here but a

distribution agreement, a requirements contract, a sales
agreement, whatever you want to call it.
QUESTION:

Mr. Schafer, did the agreements with

Continental prohibit these three small companies from
producing bread in the future?
MR. SCHAFER:
QUESTION:

No, it did not, Mr. Justice.

They were free to do that.

MR. SCHAFER:

They were free to do that, yes.

The fact is that Sheppard Eaking Company, after
this record closed, Sheppard Baking Company, in Durango, for
its own independent reasons, concluded to switch supplies
so that Continental no longer supplies Sheppard in Durango.
QUESTION:

But you did stipulate that the

understanding was that companies would not continue to
produce?
MR, SCHAFER:

Yes, we knew that they were no

longer going to be producing.
QUESTION:

They told us that.

Now, that was the understanding.

The

36
contracts may not have been explicit.
MR. SCHAFER:

It was not an understanding in a

contract bargain sense, Mr. Justice White.

It was simply

our understanding that as a matter of fact, these companies
were no longer, for their own independent reasons, going to
bake bread.
QUESTION:

But if you had — unless you had

thought they were not going to bake bread, you probably
wouldn’t have entered into the arrangement.
MR. SCHAFER:

They would have had no interest

whatsoever in buying Continental bread if they were going to
bake their own bread.
QUESTION:

Would a resumption of production on

their part have been actionable, so far as Continental was
concerned?
MR. SCHAFER:

Not at all.

Not at all.

QUESTION:

Mr. Schafer —

QUESTION:

Did Continental agree to supply all

their requirements?
QUESTION:
requirements.

It did agree to supply all their

They were free to purchase bread ~~ items

from other bakeries but Continental had the right to
approve that and the record shows that on some occasions,
application was made to purchase other products from other
bakeries and that approval was granted.

QUESTION:

Mr. Schafer, you mentioned the economics

of the bread business.
$300,000 a year.

One of these companies had sales of

What would the profit margin on sales of

that magnitude be in the bread business?
MR. SCHAFER:
tial loss.

Well, today it would be a substan­

I donpt know if the record reflects that.

That

is not high volume.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

MR. SCHAFER:

It would depend upon the kind of

scale that he could achieve in his producing plant.
Mow, with that kind of volume, he probably had
production costs running from something like 75 percent of
his total

wholesale prices and you are not competitive at

that level.

You have got to be producing the' bread at

something like 45 to 50 percent of the tot;hl price you sell
it for and the rest of your — the distribution costs
account for another 40 percent or so and theri you are looking
at a maximum of 50 percent profit.
But a small-volume baker is running very high
production costs and for that reason, these bakers, as I
say, independently concluded to withdraw from the production
end of the business but to engage, as independent companies
in the sale of the bread.
QUESTION:

Mr. Schafer, do you think the Eighth

Circuit Beatrice Food case is at all distinguishable from

your casa?
MR. SCHAFER:

I think that the underlying issue of

violation is clear — relatively clear there, Mr. Justice
Blackmun.

We contend we did not violate the order.

I

don;t know — I don’t make that contention as to Beatrice.
I think there was that acquisition there.

We are contending

there was none, but the continuing penalty question is not
distinguishable, in our judgment.
QUESTION:

There is a clear conflict on that issue.

MR. SCHAFER:
Stewart, on that issue.

It is a clear conflict, Mr. Justice
The Beatrice court adopted in toto

the arguments being urged upon this Coux-’t in this case and
that were urged on the Court in the Tenth Circuit case.
They adopted in toto the Government’s argument
that to enforce the purpose of this consent decree, you
have got to construe this transaction, this consent order,
in the way we want you to and as I say, that, in our judgment;
is contrary to all of the decisions that this Court has
rendered on the matter.
We also contended that the Government, even if
you were to look for purposes, even if you, contrary to
Armour and the other cases, if you were to agree with the
Government that you could look at purposes, it doesn’t help
the Government here at all because this was a complaint
directed against the active acquisitions, the Section VII of

39
the Clayton Act under which the complaint was filed, of’
course,

reads on acquisitions.
Your concern about concentration and whatnot is

completely handled by a ban against acquisitions.

The

retention argument just doesn't make, in our judgment, any
sense.

You don't need that.
If I acquire my competitor, of if I acquire my

competitor’s supplier or my competitor’s customer, that act
of acquisition is what Section VII reads on and if there is
any adverse impact on competition, it is that Act.
It doesn’t matter whether I scrap'

that

acquisition and sell it to the junkman or whether I retain
it.

If I buy my competitor, he is out of business for it

is no longer competition and so it is the acquisition that
the Government —
QUESTION:

If you don't sell it to the junkman

and don't scrap it and you continue to hold it and operate,
I suppose that you might be entitled —• be forced to divest.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. SCHAFER:
QUESTION:

That is true.

That is true.

On the theory — on the theory that

at the time of the divestiture, you are still injuring
competition.
MR. SCHAFER:

In a penalty action, Mr. Justice?

If we are not in the Section —
QUESTION:

No, I mean in the Section VII Act.

MR. SCHAFER:

Yea, I think that is right,

You are

still — because the Act that you committed back in 1970, if
you will, the Act that you committed at the time of suit can
be said to be causing an adverse impact on competition.
QUESTION:

I know, but divestitures normally are

not ordered if, at the time of the order, nobody is being
hurt.
MR, SCHAFER:
QUESTION:

Well, it is still a violation.

Well, that question is — what is the

theory on which a divestiture is ordered?
MR. SCHAFER:

Well, as I understand the theory,

which comes, of course, out of this Court's decisions, the
divestiture is almost mandatory where a violation of Section
VII is found, a divestiture is virtually mandatory because
that is the only hope you have of reconstituting the industry
before the illegal act occurred.
QUESTION:

And the divestiture is the antonym of

acquisition.
MR. SCHAFER:
QUESTION:

That's right.

The way you unring the bell of

acquisition is by divestiture.
MR. SCHAFER:

That’s a good word, yes.

That is

my understanding of the concept.
QUESTION:

But you don't order divestiture if at

the time the remedy question comes up there is no longer any

injury to competition.
MR. SCHAFER:

That may bo,

I have & hard time understanding how that could
then be a violation, Mr. Justice White, if there is no ~™
QUESTION:

Well, it was at the time.

MR. SCHAFER:
of the suit.

— impact of — well, at the time

The question is whether or not at the time of

the suit there was adverse impact on competition.
If there were none, I take it there would be no
violation of Section VII,

If there were, the routine

solution is divestiture to put the industry back to where it
was before.
QUESTION:

Well, that’s what makes a lawsuit.

MR. SCHAFER:

Now, in our judgment, the Government

position here as I guess I have suggested, violates the
two basic principles of consent decree construction settled
by Armour,

settled by KUghes and other cases.
One is that the language is to be construed as it

is written.

It is like a contract and this language, as the

Government really admits in its oral argument and its briefs
this thing which has to be changed in order to support its
claim for daily penalties, it has to be changed to read
beyond acquisition.

It has to incorporate the concept of

holding and retention and that —- that is not construing,
then, the consent decree as it was written.

It is constrain

42

it in a different way.
Now, the second tenet of construction is that
this Court's decisions instruct us that you

don't, as I

say, look to the purposes underlying the statute or the
purposes, so-called, underlying the consent decrees.
As I have said, the Government's position simply
doesn’t support its claim that you look toward concentration.
You solve any concern about concentration by banning the
act of acquisition.

That is what this order did.

There is no basis in this record, certainly, for
a so-called "concern on the part of the Government" that if
you don't contrue this consent order to afford the basis for
daily penalties, that you are going to have flagrant
violations of these consent decrees.
As Mr. Friedman admitted, as far as everybody
knows, there have only been two situations like this come
up in all the years of Clayton Act enforcement.
Section VII, as I have said, seems to me to be
self-enforcing, even though the only remedy there is
divestiture and anyway, such fears of enforceability or
unenforceability of consent decrees are really irrelevant
.

i

to how you construe a consent decree because we struck a
bargain in 1962.
We labored over it.
year ban.

The Government wanted a 20-

We wanted a five-year ban.

We ended up with a

43
ten-year ban.
The Government wanted to proscribe acquistions of
any companies engaged either in the production or the sale
of bread and we didn't want that because we wanted, to be
free to buy — acquire companies without violating the
order that were engaged only in the sale of bread because
at that time there were many such independent little
companies strung out around the country who were basically
one-man shows and who, from time to time, came to
Continental and wanted to be acquired because they were
getting old or something.
So vie bargained for that and we changed the word
"production or sale" in the order to "production and sale."
And so these are very important words that we bargained
over.
As the District Court found, there was a rea­
sonable basis for reading the order the way we read it, not
to ban these transactions.

There is no basis here to say

this was a flagrant violation of this order.
As I have said, there was no — there has been no
record, except for the Beatrice case, of any other situation
like this coming up and moreover, these so-called "fears
of the Government" about flagrant violations continuing can
surely be amply accommodated by changing the outstanding
orders they have to the proper procedures with proper

hearings and by writing new orders which read on the
situation as they want this one to read.
As I have said, in our judgment, the Government’s
argument here is short-sighted, consent negotiations and
consent decrees and judgments are extremely important to
the antitrust enforcement program.

They are important to

the — I know, the SEC and to other Government agencies and
if we are going to now import all kinds of vague concepts
of purpose into these consent decrees, we are going to
certainly chill any enthusiasm anybody might have for
disposing of litigation and abandoning the right to trial
by coming up with a consent disposition of a case.
The Government — turning, if I may, briefly, to
the question raised by the Government as to whether or not
we are permitted or should be permitted to raise the other
issues that we have raised in this case, for many years, at
least up to the American Express decision, this Court
routinely held, as consistent with appellate practice, that
a party can present any argument in support of the judgment
below.
The Government now claims that this Court has
gone away from that standard and has adopted a new standard.
The Government now claims that we may not, without a cross­
petition for certiorari, may not raise an issue where the
logical impact of that issue would be to secure reversal

45
below, even though the party isn't asking for it.
We have cited the Court to Mr. Steam's article
in the Harvard I;aw Review on this matter of practice.

It

says virtually everything there is to say.
QUESTION:

It says our

Strunk opinion is wrong,

doesn't it?
MR. SCHAFER:

It says the Strunk opinion and \

others can bo read in a number of ways and it says they
can be read so as not to bar a party from raising issues
in support of judgments below and Mr. Stearn, of course,
urges this Court to make that clear and he does point out
the tremendous burden that would be imposed on this Court
and upon the Solicitor General's office and upon the parties
if they were required to file what would really be useless
•v

anticipatory petitions for certiorari.
And this case is a good example.

We did not know

the Government was going to petition for certiorari until
after the period of time expired in which we could petition
because the Government, as is not unusual, got an extension
of time at the last minute.
We got notice of that in the mail after the time
had run so we didn’t have an extension of time and they did
and they filed a petition.
Now, to protect ourselves, we would have been,
under the Government's interpretation, we would have had to

46
file a precautionary petition for certain with this Court.
I don’t see any real reason to require that.

There

is no policy judgment that I can figure out that would
warrant that because in our response to the Government's
petition, we listed, in cur brief in opposition, the points
that we would raise or feel were relevant in the event the
case came up.
The Government, thereby, is not prejudiced when
it prepares its brief on the merits.

It knows all the issues

that we planned to present and can address itself to them.
So I don't think that there is any reason to
insist upon these — really, what without this strict rule of
practice would be unnecessary petition for certiorari.
QUESTION:
docket, though?

How about our control of our own

When we grant a petition for certiorari, we

know that the issue is going to be limited to one or two
issues.
Now, we could have a cross-petition and deny that,
thereby indicating that we just don't want to consider those
issues.
You are suggesting, I take it, that if a cross­
petition is filed that it would be automatically granted.
MR. SCHAFER:

No, I am not, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

I said that it seems to me the proper practice is, as we
did here, to list in our brief in opposition to the cert

47
petition those issues which we feel the Court should reach
if it gets into the case.
Now, the Court, at that time, could easily say in
its grant, we are limiting this grant to these issues.
The Court is informed, in other words, and the
Government is informed, in other words, without a label
"petition for certiorari" the Court and the Government are
informed of the issues sought to be presented and the Court
can at that time or later on control its own jurisdiction
by concluding that the issues that one seeks to present are
not cert-worthy issues on their own.
I think these issxies are clearly cert-worthy
that we are trying to present.

The underlying issue of

whether there was a violation here were distributorship
arrangements, requirements contracts, normally —
QUESTION:

It is cert-worthy if ItKis only going

to cost you $5,000.
MR, SCHAFER:

Well, the important ^question is,

Mr. Justice White, whether or not —

You decided not to, on your own, to

file a cert petition?
MR. SCHAFER:

Oh, yes.

We were content to leave

It didn't warrant coming up here

for that penalty, that is true.
the orcder has long since expired.

And the order had expired,
There was no continuing

48
dispute here that warranted our seeking this Court’s
attention.
As I say, the Issues we are seeking to present,
in our judgment, are cert-worthy, is a requirements contract
normally thought of, if at all under Section III of the
Clayton Act, is that an acquisition of. the sort that Section
VII of the Clayton Act reads on?
Is the Commission committed to reach a conclusion
that a party is

Incurring daily penalties of up to $10,000

in this case $30,000 per day

because the statute lias been

amended -— is it permitted to do tha.t without putting the
party, the Respondent, on notice that it is in jeopardy?
I think that is a very serious issue.
district courts have agreed with us on that.

Several

I think it

is clearly an important issue for this Court to reach if it
disagrees with us that daily penalties may be imposed here.
If the Court doesn’t — if the Court, in other
words, adheres to Armour and adheres to Hughes and Atlantic
Re fining and the others, of course, these other issues are
not reached.
It is only if the Court should disagree itfith us
and conclude that daily penalties may be asserted, then we
feel that the question has to be reached of was there a
violation here?

Is the Commission permitted simply to stand

idly by and let a Respondent pile up penalties and, thirdly,

49
Is ITT Continental Baking Company a. successor of Continental
where there is, In the consent order, no successors and
as signs 1anguage.
Armour, of course, flatly says that where there is
no successors and assigns language in a consent decree, the
decree is not binding on its successors and assigns.
I would think that would be dispositive of the
issue here.
QUESTION:

Mr. Schafer, is there any difference

between you and Mr. Friedman as to the maximum amount of
the possible penalty on the Government’s theory?
MR. SCHAFER:

In their complaint, they ask for

$1,000 a day, Mr. Justice Powell.
The Court, for reasons that were not stated,
assigned a penalty of $5,000 a day for one day’s violation
for two different transactions, without'an amendment to the
complaint.

We did not oppose that.

Frankly, I think the

Government could have put in a pro forma complaint amend­
ment and cured that.
The statute now permits $.10,00 per day.

It has

been amended since.
Now, if that amended revision is applicable to
this case, and I suppose it is retroactivej you are looking
at a possible penalty claim of up to $20 millions of dollars
in this case.

50
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Schafer.

Thank you, Mr. Friedman.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:52 o’clock, p.m. . the case
was submitted.]
