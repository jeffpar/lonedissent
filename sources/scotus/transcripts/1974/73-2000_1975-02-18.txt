proceedings
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We’ll hear arguments

first this morning in 73-2000, the United. States against
James Robert Peltier.
Mr. Patton, before you proceed, I want to Indicate
to you and to other counsel in these cases being argued
today that Mr. Justice Marshall reserves the right to
participate on the basis of the filed papers, of course,
and the tape recording of the

oral argument.

Now, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM L. PATTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PATTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is one of four cases that will be argued today
concerning issues related to this Court's decision in AlmeidaSanchez against the United States decided June 21, 1973*
In Almeida-Sanchez, this Court held that warrant­
less searches of automobiles for concealed Illegal aliens
conducted without probable cause by border patrol agents on
roving patrols violated the Fourth Amendment.
Each of these cases is here on writ of certiorari
to the Ninth Circuit.
The questions presented in Ortiz and Bowen, Numbers
73-2050 and 73-6848, are whether Almeida-Sanchez should be
extended to searches conducted at fixed check points and, if

4
so, whether the extension should apply to searches conducted
before the Ninth Circuit's decision in the United States
against Bowen.
The question presented in Brignoni-Ponce, Number
74-114, is whether the warrantless stop of an automobile by
border patrol officers violates the Fourth Amendment and
requires the suppression of evidence obtained as a result of
the stop, but without any subsequent search.
The sole issue presented in this case, the United
States against Peltier, Number 73-2000, is whether AlmeidaSanchez should be given retroactive effect.
The prior proceedings of this case are set forth
in detail in our brief and I will only briefly summarise them
here.
On March 7, 1973 s Respondent was indicted for
possession ot approximately 270 pounds of marijuana with
Intent to distribute in violation of Title 21 of the United
States Code,

He filed the motion to suppress the marijuana

claiming that the search 'of his automobile had violated the
Fourth Amendment and that motion was denied after a hearing.
The evidence showed that on February 28th, 1973 at
approximately 2:30 in the morning, Respondent's automobile
was stopped by border patrol agents on roving patrol near
Temecula, California.
The stop occurred on Highway 395 at a point

5
approximately 70 air miles north of the Mexican border.
The agents testified that they had stopped
Respondent’s car because he was driving an old-model car and
because he appeared to be a Mexican man.

At the agents

request, the trunk was opened to permit them to inspect for
the presence of concealed or illegal aliens.
Although no aliens xvere discovered, the agents did
find 270 pounds of marijuana in plastic bags in the trunk of
the car.
Respondent was tried on stipulated facts.

He

stipulated among other things that he possessed the marijuana
with intent to distribute.

The stipulation contained a

proviso that it could not have been entered into if his
motion to suppress had been granted and he reserved his
right to appeal the question of the suppression motion.
The District Court found Respondent guilty and
sentenced him to a prison term of one year and one day,
subject to immediate parole eligibility and to a special
parole term of two years.
The Court of Appeals sitting en banc, by a seven to
six vote, reversed the conviction and remanded the District
Court with instructions to suppress the marijuana.
fte conceded in the Court of Appeals that the search
of Respondents automobile was invalid under this Court’s
decision in Almeida—Sanchez but we urged there, as we urge

6
here, that Almelda-Sanchez should not be given retroactive
effect.
The majority in the Court of Appeals held that it
need not reach the retroactivity issue because in its view,
Almeida-Sanchez did not establish a new rule.

The majority

conceded that numerous of its decisions since 1961 had
contained language from which the Government might infer that
the Court would uphold a proving patrol search but the majority
distinguished this language as dicta, apparently on the
ground that many of these cases involved check-point searchs.
The majority also conceded that, in 1970, it had
upheld the roving patrol search in its decision in United
States against Miranda and began, in Almelda-Sanchez itself.
It also noted that the Tenth

Circuit had upheld a

roving patrol search in Roa-Rodrlquez but the majority said
these decisions enjoyed only a brief acceptance.
The decision of the Ninth Circuit is in conflict
with United States against Miller, a decision of the Fifth
Circuit which is pending before this Court on petition for
writ of certiorari in Number 73-6975.
The Ninth Circuit also reached the opposite result
in the United States against Bowen.

The only difference

between Bowen and this case is that Bowen involved check­
point search and there the majority — again by a seven to six
■/ote f ounct that A.lmeida—Sanchez had overruled clear past

7
precedent.
The Tenth Circuit has given Almeida-Sanchez retro­
active effect in the case of check-point searches and pre­
sumably it would give it

retroactive effect in the case of

roving patrol searches.
We submit that Almeida-Sanchez did, indeed, estab­
lish a neitf rule that overruled past Court of Appeals prece­
dent and the long-established practice and that under
principles of this Court*3 retroactivity decisions and under
principles of exclusionary rule policy itselfs
Sanchez should not be given retroactive effect.

AlmeidaThat is, it

should not apply to searches conducted before June 21, 19739
the date on which it was decided.
Support for roving patrol searches prior to
Almeida-Sanchez was both judicial and statutory.

Section

1357 of Title 8 authorized Immigration and Naturalization
Service officers without a warrant, ’within a reasonable
distance from any external border of the United States, to
board and search any vehicle or conveyance for Illegal
aliens.
In regulations promulgated under the statute, the
Attorney General had defined a reasonable distance from the
borders to be any point between 100 air miles from an
external boundary.
Now, we believe that the statute alone, in the

8
absence of the contrary judicial construction would be
sufficient basis for reliance by law-enforcement officers and
would present a retroactivity question and that, we believe,
is the thrust of this Court’s plurality opinion in Lemon
against Kurtzman, declining to give retroactive effect to its
prior decision holding a Pennsylvania statute unconstitutional
that provided public aid to non-public sectarian schools.
But we do not rely on the statute alone because the
constitutionality of the statute xvas upheld in numerous
decisions in the Fifth, Ninth and Tenth Circuits,
The Ninth Circuit distinguished many of these cases
as dicta, as I said, presumably on the grounds that they
involved check-point searches.

But the language in those

decisions was not so limited and prior to Almeida-Sanchez,
there was no distinction drawn in the case law between check­
point searches and roving patrol searches and the majority in
the Ninth Circuit conceded that its cases contained language
from which the Government might infer that roving patrol
searches would be upheld and that, of course, is precisely
what happened.
The Ninth Circuit upheld roving patrol searches in
Miranda and Almeida-Sanchez.

The Tenth Circuit, in its

decision in United States against Roa-Rodriguez, and the Fifth
Circuit In its decision the the United States against Miller.
Mr. Justice Powell's concurring opinion in

9
Almelda-Sanehez recognized this consistent judicial approval.
He wrote that roving automobile searches in border regions
for aliens have been consistently approved by the judiciary.
And Mr. Justice White’s dissenting opinion also
recognized this prior judicial approval for he observed that
the courts have consistently and almost without dissent
come to the same conclusion that is invited in the judgment
that is reversed today.
Respondent himself recognized at the time of his
suppression motion that the state of the law sustained
roving patrol stops and searches for concealed illegal
aliens.
In the District Courts he contended that while
it was permissible to stop and search for aliens, once
border patrol agents discovered no illegal aliens, they then
were required to go no further, even though they observed
the marijuana in the trunk of the car.

Fov example, at page 23 of the Appendix, REspondent’s counsel stated to the Court, "Now, if Agent Ainscoe
had felt the bag to see if there was an alien in there, I
would say, fine, we do not have an illegal search and seizure."
Respondent did ask that his case be stayed pending
this Court’s decision in Almeida-Sanchez.

That is simply

recognition that he needed a change in the law.
The only additional factors which could be

.10

required are either a prior decision by this Court or
additional Court of Appeals opinions, but neither requirement
is sound.
There is no support in this Court *s decisions for
the proposition that a decision must overrule a prior prece­
dent of this Court before a retroactivity issue is presented.
In Chevron Oil against Houston, for example, this
Court declined to give retroactive effect to Rodriguez against
Aetna Casualty, even though Rodriguez had overruled only a
long line of Fifth Circuit opinions.
QUESTION:
cases are there?

That is for example.

Now, what other

If any.

MR. PATTON:

Other than Chevron, I don't think of

any, your Honor.
QUESTION:

There aren’t any, are there?

And Chevron was a civil case, wasn’t it?
MR. PATTON:
QUESTION:
MR. PATTON:

It was a civil case.
Involving
But in Link-letter, Mr. Justice Stewart,

as the Court indicated that it saw no difference between civil
and criminal cases for purposes of retroactivity.
I think —* we believe that the majority opinion in
Boi^en in the Ninth Circuit is the correct analysis on this
Point.

Every issue cannot be brought to this Court and by

necessity a number of important issues of law enforcement

11
must be litigated in the Courts of Appeal.
QUESTION:
good

This issue was brought to this Court a

many years ago, in Carroll against the United States.
MR. PATTON:

Mr. Justice Stexuart.

Well, we disagree about that,
We believe that it is true that the

Court's opinion in Almeida-Sanchea relied on prior Fourth
Amendment precedent but there was an intervening federal
statute which we believe the law enforcement officers were
entitled to rely on until courts declared otherw5.se and
this issue was

litigated

in the Courts of Appeals for the

Fifth, Ninth and Tenth Circuit and the Government never lost
the issue.
Now, we rely on this Court's opinion in Lemon
agaj-rcsfr Kurtzman that statutory or even judge-made rules of
law are hard facts on which people must rely in making
decisions and in shaping their conduct and that is exactly
what the border patrol did.
Roving patrols were extensively used in the
Mexican border area prior to Almeida-Sanchez.
-

i''ov

example, we are informed that in Fiscal Year

19/'S, approximately 240,000 man-hours were devoted to highway
surveillance or roving patrol searches or roving patrol
activities.
We believe that Almeida-Sanchea did establish a
new rule, that it was a clear break with the past and under

12

this court's retroactivity decision

and under exclusionary

rule policy Itself, it should not be given retroactive effect.
This Court's decisions have established three tests.
The first and most important of those is the purpose of the
rule itself and uniformly, this Court's decisions Involving
the exclusionary rule have declined to give exclusionary
rule decisions retroactive effect.
V/hether the rule is viewed as ^directed at conforming
police conduct or it is indicating the x-ight of privacy
prooecced by the Fourth Amendment, in either case there Is no
effect on the integrity of the fact-finding process and neither
purpose is advanced by retroactive application.
.*he second two cests, the extent of reliance by lawenforcement ox zleers and the disruption of the administration
of justice that would result from retroactive application ar*e
looked to only when the purpose of the rule is neutral as to
retroactivity and as we have indicated, that purpose is not
neutral but looking to those tests, there was widespread
reliance on the authority to conduct roving patrol searches
and as for a disruption, there are approximately H0 cases in
the Courts of Appeal that involve Aimed da-~S an chez roving
patrol issues.
there are an indeterminate number of cases in the
district Courts and, of course, there A/ould be a large number
of cases affected in collateral attack proceedings if

13
Almeida-Sanchez ifere given retroactive effect.
For all of these reasons, we submit that AlmeldaSanchez should not be applied to searches conducted before
the date that it was decided and we submit that the judg­
ment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Shapery.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SANDOR W. SHAPERY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. SHAPERY:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The main question that we are confronted, with
here is whether or not

Almelda-Sanchez should be applied

retroactively or prospectively.
However, before we should even approach that
question, we must realize that the issue of retroactivity
only applies to a new constitutional rule.
The dissenting opinion in Milton versus Walnwright,
I believe, the Government will clearly agree sets up the
test for determining whether or not a new constitutional
rule is even

stated by a decision of this Court and that is,

whether it overrules clear-cast precedent or disruptive
practice long accepted and widely relied upon.
The third —
QUESTION:

MR. SHAPERY:

I don’t feel that any statutes of

the United States are greater than the Constitution.
QUESTION:

statute —
QUESTION:

I asked you whether the statute author­

ised the — purported to authorize the search and escape?
MR. SHAPERY:

Read literally, the statute would

purportedly authorize the search.
QUESTION:

Had it ever been held unconstitutional

before Almeida?
MR* SHAPERY:

1 don’t believe that the issue had

even been up before the Court.
QUESTION:

Let’s assume the statute, In so many

words, authorizes a particular kind of search and officers
have been operating under it and performing in.accordance
with its terms.
It has never been held unconstitutional.
And then the Court declares it unconstitutional.
Now, what about the retroactivity issue in that
context?
ML. SHAPERY:

I think, to determine the retroactivity

issue in that context we must look at the statute itself
ana whether or not the reliance on the literal interpretation

15
of the statute was even reasonable and I feel that looking
at this statute, 1357 Section Ai and Section A2 —
QUESTION:
although the Court

You don't think it was even reasonable
of Appeals just said it was?

MR. SHAPERY:

I don't think it was.

I don't think

the Section A3 being read devoid of Fourth Amendment is
reasonable in light of the fact that Section Al and A2 have
recognized Fourth Amendment requirements of constitutionality.
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that one of the

border patrol officers reading the statute should have known
that on its face it was .unconstitutional?
MR. SHAPERY:

No, I am suggesting that the

attorneys that wrote the statute for the Government were
perfectly aware of the problem and were aware that they were
treading on, so to speak, thin lce and — in regard to this
but saw that this was a viable alternative and that they
may step forward and take their chances until the question is
presented to this Court.
It was submitted that this Court's decision in
Almeida -Sanchez overruled past precedent.

However, the

test is clear past precedent.
We do not feel that one case prior to AlmeldaSanChez allowing a roving patrol to stop and search a car
without probable cause or even reasonable suspicion, that
criminal activity was afoot establishes clear past precedent.

16
As a matter of fact, the Ninth Circuit has held,
with the exception of United States versus Rand and AlmeidaSanchea, that all other cases that have ever addressed them­
selves to that issue required either probable cause to believe
that the vehicle had contraband or illegal aliens or that
there was a reasonable certainty [that] existed that contra­
band was aboard the vehicle at the time it entered the United
States or a reasonable certainty the vehicle contained aliens
or goods which had just been smuggled into the United States.
This is the Ninth Circuit’s own recognition of
their prior case law.
Contrary to the Ninth Circuit, the Tenth Circuit
and the Fifth Circuit have uniformly required reasonable or
founded suspicion to stop and search prior to this Court’s
?

decision in Alneida-Sanchea.
It would appear, therefore, that the Ninth Circuit
is the Only court and that the United States versus Almeida-Sanchez and the United States versus Miranda are the only
cases which held that the border patrol can make a roving
stop and search of a vehicle without probable cause or founded
suspicion or even any recognition of Fourth Amendment rights
un de r the Con s t i tut i on.
On this basis I feel that it can be hardly argued
that this Court’s decision in Almeida-Sanchez
past precedent.

overruled clear

17
The second test is, did this Court's decision
overrule a practiced law exception x^idely relied upon?
As I pointed out, I feel that the reliance must be
reasonable.

I do not think that illegal governmental

activity should be allotted to establish constitutional pre­
cedent, no matter how long it has been relied upon and
this is exactly what the Government is asking to occur in
this situation.
The Government has relied on Section 1357(A)(3)
on its literal interpretation which is

completely devoid of

the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution and it is unreason­
able in the light of the fact that prior decisions of
circuit courts have held that the same statute but a prior
code section, 1357(A)(1), applied the Fourth Amendment
reasonable suspicions standard to interrogate an alien and
that was in the case of Au Yi Lau versus the Immigration and
Naturalisation Service.
Likewise, Section 1357(A)(2) applied the Fourth
Amendment probable cause to arrest an alien in Yan Sang Kwai,
another Circuit Court decision.
On that basis I feel that it is unreasonable to
hold that the first two sections of the Act Require
recognition of the Fourth Amendment where the third section
of the Act can be read completely devoid of the constitu­
tional requirement.

18
Likewisej I feel that the governmental reliance on
the statute was unreasonable in light of the history of the
immigration laws which have been set out in the Br1gnoni-Ponce
brief of Petitioner.
All prior statutes recognized Fourth Amendment
requirements even in this area.
Furthermore, the small number of cases which even
address themselves to the moving search show that there was
very little reliance upon this practice.
Therefore, it can hardly be said that this Court's
decision in A1meIda-Sanchez

overruled the practice which was

long accepted and widely relied upon as one of the require­
ments to determine whether a new constitutional rule has
been established.
On that basis it is submitted that Almelda-Sanchez
did not establish new constitutional rule but merely
reaffirmed the long line of decisions which have followed
Carroll versus the__Un_ited States.
To hold that A Ime i da-S anchez

establishes a new

exclusionary rule based solely on Governmental reliance would
foe to hold that the Government can establish constitutional
precedent by its illegal unilateral activity.
The third test, as set out in Chevron Oil versus
£usaa, was whether or not Almeida-Sanchez

decided an issue

of first impression whose resolution was not clearly

19
foreshadowed.
The Chevron 01.1 case held that Respondent can
only rely on the law as it then was so we must look to the
law as it then was.
The Fifth Circuit had determined that a roving
check

always requires at least a reasonable or founded

suspicion and recognized application of the Fourth Amendment.
The Ninth Circuit and the Tenth Circuit , since
this Court's decision in

Almeida-Sanchez,

have stated that

a roving check always required probaole cause.
They find this — they achieve this conclusion by
determining that this Court's decision in Almeida-Sanchez
did not state a new rule but merely reaffirmed Carroll versus
the United States and on that basis, that has always been the
rule.
Based on the Chevron Oil case which held that
Respondent can only rely on the law

as it then was, it is

submitted that Peltier can only rely on the law as it then
was and it has been determined that the law as it then was
required probable cause to stop and search a vehicle by a
roving border patrolman.
Even applying the straight reasonableness test as
set out in the dissent in Almeida-Sanchez,
Almeida--.Sano.hez ,

Peltier, unlike

lacked reasonableness.

By comparison, the highway where Almeida-Sanchez

20

was apprehended came directly from the border.
In Peltier, the highway upon which he was appre­
hended began in downtown San Diego and it is one of che ^hree
major roads lea.d3.ng out of Southern California.
In Altneida-Sanchez,

Wasn't the highway parallel to the border?
MR. SHAPERY:

It was parallel to the border but I

believe it terminated in Colexico or Mexicali, which is the
twin bordertown.

case.

That, as I recollect, was the record in that

But it is, perhaps, not that important.
MR. SHAPERY:

It was further stated In Almeida-

Sanchez that this highway is often used by smugglers of contra­
band and illegal aliens because it did not have a check-point.
On the contrary, there is a fixed check-point.
There was a fixed check-point on Highway 395 right --- right
near the point where Peltier xvas stopped.
QUESTION:

Is this the [inaudible]?

MR. SHAPERY:
QUESTION:

No, this is the Temecula check-point.

MR. SHAPERY:

It is approximately the same location

MR. SHAPERY:

Yes, it is.

Almeida-Sanchea

That is correct.

from the border, where Peltier was stopped 70 miles from the
border.

the State of California.
In A Intel da-San chez —•
QUESTION:

What are you talking about, the

’’second-largest city” in — ?
QUESTION:

San Diego.

MR. SHAPERY:
QUESTION:

San Diego.

San Diego?

MR. SHAPERY:

Right.

Highway 395, upon which

Mr. Peltier was stopped, begins in downtown San Diego and
all of i/he residents of can Diego wishing to go to northern
inland California or even to the midwest would be going on
Highway 395 as the most direct route.
So there would be millions of people who had never
even been oo che Mexican border travelling on this highway
in the same direction that Mr. Peltier was and at the same
point.
QUESTION:
French name.

Mr. Peltier was, in fact — he has a

Was he a United States citizen or an American

or a Frenchman or what?
MR. SHAPERY:

M r. Peltier is a United States

22
and he — as far as I know, had never even been to Mexico.
I don’t even know whether he even speaks any
Spanish.

I don’t think he does, but I know that he does not

speak with an accent and upon communieating with him, the
border patrol officers could easily recognize that he was not
a Mexican citizen or even of Mexican descent,as they had
stated when they pulled him over.
QUESTION:

But that is no guarantee that he might

not have aliens in his back seat.
MR. SHAPERY:

That is true but there is no guarantee

that any person, any citizen in San Diego might not be having
aliens behind the back seat.
QUESTION.*

And in this case there was no showing of

any kind that either he or his car had ever either been to
Mexico or had aliens in it.
MR. SHAPERY:
another distinguishing

None whatsoever.

In fact, that is

factor between Almsida-Sanchez

and

Peltier is that in addition to the fact that Almelda-Sanchez
was a resident of Mexico and had stated that he was coming
from Mexico, Mr. Peltier was questioned before the search as
to his citizenship and as to where he was coming from and as
to his destination, at which point he stated he was coming
from San Diego and he was going to Las Vegas, never having
even mentioned the Mexican border or having been there.
Looking at the totality of the circumstances and

23

set out in the

dissent in Mmelda-Sanches ,

taking all of

the factors in Almeida-Sanches
QUESTION:

Does the record show in this case the

point of origin of the marijuana that he was carrying in
his car?
MR. SHAPERY:
QUESTION:

No, It does not.

Mr. Shapery, what do you perceive to

be the principal purpose of the exclusionary rule?
MR. SHAPERY:

The principal purpose of the

exclusionary rule is to deter unlawful governmental conduct
and at the same time insulate the court system and maintain
the integrity of the judicial system in determining decisions.
QUESTION:

I think in Calandra we said that the

principal purpose of that rule was to deter future police
misconduct.
The rule that you advocate here today would not
be relevant to that, would it?
MR. SHAPERY:

I think it vsrould be relevant to that

inasmuch as I believe the conduct in this situation was one,
unreasonable in light of the fact that the statute had
always required -

all the statutes had required probable

cause.
We have to look to the reasonableness and I think
that to hold that the exclusionary rule only totally across

2k

the board will prevent future conduct, would be to give the
Government and oversealous law enforcement officers a free
ride to conduct illegal activities until such

time as this

Court decides the issue.
QUESTION:

Do you think where there is a statute

enacted by the Congress that — I think you conceded earlier
authorised this type of stop and search — should be rejected
by policemen on their own initiative before this Court decides
it is unconstitutional?
MR. SHAPERY:

"
I feel that Congress has always

recognised the Fourth Amendment and that in passing this
legislation they did not intend to completely abrogate the
Fourth Amendment in this particular statute, as is shown in
Section (A)(1) and (A)(2).

There has always been recognition

for the Fourth Amendment and I feel that it is a unilateral
activity of the border patrol which has' overstepped the
bounds, not Congress.
And on that basis it is their unilateral illegal
activity which has abrogated the use of the Fourth Amendment.
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting the statute requires

probable cause for a search at the border?
MR. SHAPERY:
QUESTION:

No, 1 am not.

I — I —

Well, it is the same section that auth­

orizes it.
MR. SHAPERY:

I think there is — there is a

25
distinction —
QUESTION:

It is the same section, isn’t it?

MR. SHAPERY:

I believe that it refers to a

search at the border or functional equivalent.
QUESTION:

Well, it refers to a search at the

border or a reasonable distance from the border.
MR. SHAPERY:
QUESTION:

That Is correct but I

Well, it is the same statute that

authorizes the examination at the border as authorizes an
examination a reasonable distance from the border.
Now, are you suggesting the statute requires
probable causer at the border?
MR. SHAPERY:

I am suggesting that the statute

requires recognition of the Fourth Amendment.
QUESTION:

Well, what about probable cause at

the border?
MR. SHAPERY:

I feel that the probable cause Issue

at the border is not brought up inasmuch as the Government
has a need to protect the integrity of the entire country.
QUESTION:

But the statute on its face purports to

authorize the same kind of a search a reasonable distance
from the border as it does at the border, as you — I thought
indicated earlier in our conversation.
MR. SHAPERY:
QUESTION:

That is correct,

And so that a border patrol officer '

26
does have , or did have some thought that this statute
authorised warrantless and non-probable cause searches although
not exactly at the border.
And it is a rather old statute,, isn’t it?
MR. SHAPERY:

I believe the statute was enacted in

19^6 and amended in 1952.
The reasonable distance requirement, though, I
believe Would relate to the functional equivalent of the
border and on that basis where it is —
QUESTION:

A different point may be that it isn’t a

functional equivalent.
MR. SHAPERY:
QUESTION:

I believe that is the case.

That is another matter but it isn’t ~ if

i.1, were it wouldn't have to have probable cause.
MR. SHAPERY:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Doesn’t it come down to the preposition

uhat you are saying that the officer should Lave known and
been able to predict the ultimate outcome of the AlmeidaSanches case?
MR. SHAPERY:
QUESTION:

I don’t think that is the case.

In terms of the deterrence that Mr. Jus­

tice Powell was asking you about.
MR. SHAPERY:

I think the point should not have

been left up to the individual officer as such.

I think that

•;.ne problem stems from his superiors, from the attorneys

27
working in creating these rules and regulations pursuant to
the statute and I feel that they at all times realized that
they were rather in a precarious position.
However, looking to the recent application of the
exclusionary rule, they possibly felt that until some
alternative better than this comes up, wefll do what we can
as long as we can.
And on that basis the interpretation has been
unreasonable through its application wherein other sections
of the statute require probable — not probable cause but
require recognition of Fourth Amendment requirements.
In the Ninth Circuit, the courts, for a short
period of time, held that the statute could be read devoid
of the Constitution and I feel that this is not a new rule
where a statute must be read in recognition of the higher
law of the land than the Constitution.
So the question comes down to whether or not it is
a new rule that a law or a statute passed must be read in
recognition of the Constitution.
That is not a new rule.

It has been with us from

the beginning of our legal history and oh that basis we have
to

to Carroll versus the United States as establishing

a rule by this Court that has not been modified by

this

Court but merely reaffirmed by the case in Aimed da-S an the a.
Additionally I?d like to point out that the border

28
patrol agents, upon examination ■, have stated that the sole
basis for their stopping Mr. Peltier is that he appeared fco
be of a

Mexican descent.
This3 in itself is invidious discriminations to

stop and search a car because a person appears to be of
Mexican descent.
'

QUESTION:

Well, what if they stopped him because

he spoke Spanish?
MR. SHAPERY:

I don't feel that they -- that they

could tell thair he spoke Spanish.
QUESTION:

Well, I didn't ask you whether they had

in fact stopped him because he spoke Spanish.
I said., what if they had stopped him because he
spoke Spanish?
MR, SHAPERY;

I have a little trouble with the

analogy because I can't understand how they would know that
he spoke Spanish until they made the stop and that at that
point they would have violated his constitutional rights
through this invidious discrimination.
QUESTION:

We11, do you feel that stopping a person

for speaking Spanish is of the same order in your apparent
scale of values as stopping a person because he appeared to
be of Mexican descent?
MR. SHAPERY:

I think the courts have held that

discrimination based upon apparent national origin is

29
invidious discrimination and because a person speaks
Spanish is justification for the stop.
I feel that that is just one step away from
Mexican descent and is just another justification for this
invidious discrimination.
QUESTION:

Isn’t it the job of the border patrol

to figure out who are illegal aliens from Mexico and who
are people either lawfully admitted aliens or United States
citizens that they don’t have any business with?
MR. SHAPERY:

I believe that the decision Almeida-

Sanchez has established that the border patrolmen cannot
do this without probable cause.
QUESTION;

Well, what I am trying to get at is,

what are the elements of probable cause?

You apparently

rule out both speaking Spanish and the appearance of Mexican
nationality.
MR. SHAPERY:

I think the Ninth Circuit has

established that a person’s national origin or his ancestry
must remain a neutral factor not to be considered by the
Court because it would raise an

issue of invidious

disc rimination.
QUESTION:

Even if he is stopped at the border

they can’t ask him his national ancestry?
MR. SHAPERY:

No, getting stopped at the border I

think is quite a different matter.

As I have stated —-

QUESTION:

Well, but I should think it would be as

invidious there as it would be any place else.
MR. SHAPERY:

Well, the Government has a need and

the public has an interest in maintaining the integrity of
the country and that integrity is maintained through con­
trolling what is coming into the country.
Now, we do not have a situation felt here.

We have

a stop of a person north of the second largest city in
California on the sole basis -QUESTION:

Well, would this be Invidious at the

border?
MR. SHAPERY:
QUESTION:

I don’t think so.

Rut it would be, say, 10 miles Inland.

Ml, SHAPERY:

If they had no reason to believe that

this person had crossed the border, I would think so.
QUESTION:

Well, then, the same answer you would

give if It were one mile north of the border?
MR. SHAPERY:

I think that the proximity to the

border has a lot to do with the reasonableness -- using the
reasonableness standard as set out in the dissent.
x think that the distance from the border, in
or
addition to the distance , the route ,/the proximity to a —
QUESTION:

Of course, that question isn’t really

before us, the reasonableness, is it?
MR. SHAPERY:

I am —

31
QUESTION:

That isn’t raised in the petition for

certiorari.
MR. SHAPERY:
QUESTION:

I believe that —

The question Is retroactivity.

MR. SHAPERY:

I believe that the question of

reasonableness can be raised inasmuch as —
QUESTION:

On a plain error basis?

MR. SHAPERY:

Is that it?

Well, it was pointed out in the

Government case in Bowen on page 11, note 6 that if a party
prevails in a lower decision they can bring up any basis or
any ground upon which to additionally make deteivnination in
their case.
The issue of reasonableness has been maintained
\
from the trial court level.
I wish to also point out that all circuit courts
who have ever addressed themselves to this issue, that is,
the Fifth and the Ninth and the Tenth, would obtain the
exact same result In Peltier as the Ninth had and the Ninth
and the Tenth Circuits hold that the lav/ now, after Almeida-Sanchez, always required probable cause to search on a
roving patrol, wherein Almelda-Sanchez reaffirmed the rule
of Carroll versus the United States.
On that basis, the Ninth Circuit has held that
lacking probable cause, lacking recognition of the Fourth
Amendment, that Peltier, like Almeida-Sanchez, should have

32

the evidence suppressed.
Now, the Fifth Circuit has always required — now,
this is pre-Almeida-Sanchez, has always required a least a
founded or reasonable suspicion and since June 25th — or
since June 21st, 1973, it required probable cause.
But even

the Fifth Circuit, on pre-Almeida-Sanchez

law, would have suppressed the evidence in Peltier because it
did not even comport to the founded or reasonable suspicion
requirements.
Therefore, lacking probable cause or even a founded
or reasonable suspicion,' all the circuits would have dismissed
Peltier.
The Government in this situation attempted to apply
a statute completely devoid of

the Fourth Amendment require­

ments.
Nov/, the Ninth Circuit, for a short period of time,
went along with the Immigration and Nationality Service.
However, the Fifth Circuit at all times refused
to go along with recognizing ™ without recognizing the Fourth
Amendment at all and they attempted to carve an exception to
Carroll versus the United States by requiring a founded
suspicion and applying, therefore, a

minimal Fourth Amendment

recognition.
Now, to agree with the Fifth Circuit would be to
allow al'l circuit courts to establish their own constitutional

33
exceptions until overturned by this Court and I feel that to
so do that would create chaos in lower court decisions giving
them authority to carve exceptions to rules established by
this Court and justify those exceptions until the issue is
brought to this Court and reviewed or overturned.
Constitutional rules should begin with the
Supreme Court and they should end with the Supreme Court
and, as occurred in the case of Carroll versus the United
States and reaffirmed by Almeida-Sanchez, Peltierfs case
should be affirmed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further, Mr. Patton?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM L. PATTON, ESQ.,
MR. PATTON:

Mr, Chief Justice, I just would like

to make a few quick remarks.
First of all, we are not talking about the
government's unilateral conduct establishing a rule.
was a federal statute that had been construed

in

There

all the

circuits that encompassed jurisdictions bordering on the
Republic of Mexico,
We disagree with Respondent's analysis of the
decisions of the Fifth, Tenth and Ninth Circuits and we
say this is simply not true, that there was any requirement
of probable cause for immigration searches prior to AlmeidaSanchez .

34
The Fumagalli decision in the Ninth Circuit,which
is discussed in Justice White's dissenting opinion in

Almeida-Sanchez, is represented in the Ninth Circuit decisions.
They drew a distinction between contraband searches
for which they required probable cause and immigration searches
And in immigration searches relying on the statute they did
not require probable cause.
And the same is true in the Fifth Circuit.

If you

look at the Miller decisions and the Wright decision which is
cited in our brief, you will see that what the Fifth Circuit
said is that the test is whether the

search is reasonable

under the circumstances but it was not probable cause or
reasonable suspicion.
If it was, it was no more than a requirement that
border patrol officers search only compartments large enough
to conceal illegal aliens and as to the reasonableness issue
which Respondent has brought up in his argument, 1 don't be­
lieve that was raised in the Court of Appeals and, unfortun­
ately I don't have the briefs here and I don't think it
should be considered now.
But in any event, under the prior law —
QUESTION:

Well, why isn't he entitled to defend the

decision below on any ground that doesn't expand his relief?
MR. PATTON:

Well, he would — ordinarily this

Court would not consider an issue that was not raised.

\
35
QUESTION:

Ordinarily toe would.

Ordinarily \ire

would if our Respondent — If he is defending a decision
below on the grounds —• even if It was rejected below.
MR. PATTON:
QUESTION:

Well, it —
If he doesn’t try to expand his

j udgment.
MR. PATTON:

Well, let me assume, Mr. Justice

White, for the purpose of argument, that it can be raised
now even so, as we have said, under all the decisions in
the Ninth, Tenth and Fifth Circuits there is simply nothing
to the claim that the search was unreasonable under prior
law, prior to Almelda-Sanchez.
QUESTION:

Could I ask you a question?

I may as

well ask you now as in some later case.
Is the Government seeking to get any kind of an
area warrant for any check point?
MR. PATTON:

Well, Mr. Justice White, at Temecula,

where ohis search was conducted, we did operate a check
p0-L.iio i-here ior a period in 1974 under an area warrant.
Unfortunately, in October of 197-4, the District
Court in the Central District of California refused to renew
the warrant on the ground that it lacked the authority to
give an area warrant.
We didn’t go up on that case but we have taken the
Issue up co the Ninth Circuit and Mr. Evans will discuss

36
this in more detail in his argument in Ortis and Bowen .
QUESTION:

All right,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen,,
