ORAL ARGUMENT OF GERALD P. NORTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. MORTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, there's a chart I'll

be using the course of the argument, which I’d like to have
set up before I proceed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Very well.

Is that

reproduced in smaller form, too?
MR. NORTON:

Yes, copies have been handed up to the

Court.
QUESTION %

That's this tiling here?

MR. NORTON:

That's right.

QUESTION: Very good.
QUESTION:

What you just put on the easel, is that

in the record, or is it just illustrative?
MR., NORTON;

It's just illustrative.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
This case is on appeal from a judgment of the United
States District Court for the District of Columbia, granting
the defendants' motion to dismiss the government's complaint
in a Sherman Act case.

4
The case involves interpretation of several provisions
of the Investment Company Act of 1940, concerning mutual funds,
and the relationship of that Act to the antitrust laws»
In reviewing the many briefs, we found some confusion
in terminology and some misapprehension of the government's
position in this case.

We've tried to address some of those

problems in the Reply Brief we filed last x*?eek, and we've also
prepared this illustrative chart, xtfhich I think may help
clarify some of the relationships that are involved in this
case,
Basically, a mutual fund or an investment company is
a company that invests shareholders' money in the stock of
other companies.
This esse involves the most common type of mutual
fund, 'which is the open-end mutual fund.

Its distinctive

characteristics are that shares are always redeemable by the
shareholder from the fund, at a proportional amount of the net.
asset value of the funds at the time of redemption,
Although they are not required to do so by law, the
funds, most of them, are continually offering shares to the
public.

Borne, however, have, for either short-term or long­

term periods, stepped offering and are closed up, as they say.
There are two basic types of open-end mutual funds;
the "load" funds and "no load" funds.

"Load" refers to a sales

charge that the purchaser pays at the time of purchase.

5
As a practical matter, the issues here involve only
the load funds, and it is to those load, open-end mutual funds
that I will he referring throughout.
In the initial distribution of mutual funds shares,
we have the vertical alignment shown in the center of the
chart.

The mutual fund distributes its share to a single

underwriter, known as the principal underwriter, pursuant to
an underwriting contract.
Then the underwriter typically sells those shares
to a large number of dealers through dealer contracts,

ile’ve

only shown one in the chart for illustration, but there would
be many of these in the ordinary scheme.
Then the contract dealer, as that dealer is known,
sells the shares to the public, to investors.
The investor can then redeem directly from the fund
or can also redeem by going tbrough the dealer or the under­
writer — although we have not shown that here.
Now, this is called the primary distribution system,
in the mutual fund industry.
There is also a secondary market in transactions
involving mutual funds, as with any other securities.
Now, in the ordinary securities market, the secondary
market is the one of most importance to investors, that is
where issued shares are trade on the stock exchange,
A secondary market provides alternatives to the

6

primary distribution system for an investor either v/ishing to
buy or sell shares, in that the investor can purchase from
either a contract dealer or another dealer or from an investor,
either going through a broker or directly.
Because of the nature of the securities business,
a securities firm will be acting in various capacities, depending
on the transaction involved.

The same firm can, at different

times in different transactions, be a broker, meaning that it's
acting as an agent in the purchase or sale of securities;
whereas a dealer, meaning that it's acting as a principal for
its own account, if it has a contract with respect to the
shares involved, it would be a contract dealer.

As to those

shares for which it has no contract, it would be a non-contract
dealer,
Nov/, although the chart here shows contract dealer,
non-contract dealer, and broker as three separate categories,
the same firm could be in all three of those categories as to
different transactions.
The term "broker dealer*' is used generically to refer
to any firm in the securities business as either a broker or
dealer.
Nearly all broker dealers are members of the defendant
National Association of Securities Dealers,

That is the only

association that has been registered under the Maloney Act of
1938, which amended the Securities Exchange Act.

That provides

7
a measure of industry self-government subject to the oversight
of the Securities Exchange Commission, under rules adopted by
and reviewed by the Commission covering specified subjects»
None of the rules of the NASD are involved directly
in this case.
Now, Section 22(d) of the Investment Company Act
provides, in relevant part, that if a mutual fund is currently
offering its shares to the public, then no principal under­
writer and no deeiler may sell shares of that fund to any
person except another dealer underwriter or the fund, except
that the public offering price described in 'die prospectus —
I’ll return to that public offering price in a moment.
Also involved in this case is Section 22(f) of the
Investment Company Act, which provides that no mutual fund
may restrict the transferability or negotiability of its
shares, except in conformity with statements made with respect
thereto in its registration statement, and not in contravention
of any rules prescribed by the Commission in the interest of
the holders of all outstanding shares.
22(d) had no direct effect on the price of mutual
fund shares, although 22 — I'm sorry, 22(f) has no direct
effect? 22(d) does, as I'll illustrate.
If the fund is currently offering its shares to the
public, there's no dispute that the price to an investor,
charged by a dealer, must be the public offering price described

8

in the prospectus, whether that's a contract dealer or a non­
contract dealer.
Now, that price is effectively the net asset value
of the report, proportional amount of the net asset value of
the fund, plus a sales load designated by the fund.
Typically, that is a maximum of 8.5 percent of the
total amount paid.
Now, the price from the underwriter to the dealer is
governed by the dealer contract, and that is typically the
public offering price less a dealer discount, which, for 8.5
percent sales load would typically be 7 percent.
The price to the underwriter from the fund would
be net asset value, meaning that the underwriter gets a net of
the 1.5 percent difference between public offering price and
its price to the dealer,
QUESTION:

Is there no control on this load?

No

governmental control?
MR. NORTON:

Oh, yes.

There are other provisions

of the Act which provide means of regulation of the sales load,
other provisions of Section 22.
Now, there's also no dispute that the Act places
no limitation on the price that one investor can charge
another for shares of a fund.

It's considered market price

there.
As a practical matter, the range is likely to

9
be between net asset value that the selling investor can .get
from the fund on redemption, and the public offering price that
the buying investor could get the shares for from a dealer*
It's also no limitation on the price that an investor
can get from a sale to a dealer.
Now, by its terms, 22(d) does not apply to sales by
one dealer to another.

This is the so-called inter-dealer

market.
22(d) also does not impose any restriction, by its
terms, on sales by a broker to anyone,
QUESTION:

Is it clear that the language, the word

"dealer" in 22(d) does not apply to a broker as well?
MR, NORTON;

Well, those terms are separately defined

and, as I’ve indicated, the same, any broker dealer is at
various times a broker or a dealer.
So someone who is acting in a brokerage capacity
would not. be governed by 22(d),
QUESTION;

So when you're describing the functions,

those functions are descriptions contained in the statute
itself?
MR, NORTON;

They are in part contained in the statute

and in part a description of the industry as it operates and
as it has been characterized by the Commission, to which I will
come in a moment.
Now, unlike the markets fob other securities, the

10

market for mutual funds is almost entirely the primary distribu­
tion system,. There are no, really no secondary markets for
mutual fund shares.

Thera's a tiny interdealer market.

There's

no dealer market of sales to investors, and there's virtually
no brokerage market.
Therefore, at present the investor has, as a practical
matter, no choice but to buy at the. public offering price and
to sell at net asset value.
But the development of computer technology, the
potential impact or importance of a brokerage market has been
somewhat enhanced, in that it's possible to natch, buy and sell
orders in a broker age transaction in a way that has not always
been so.
But secondary interdealer and brokerage markets have
not developed because, in large part, they have been restrained
by agreements, provisions in underwriting agreements and dealer
agreements which effectively either fix the price at which
such transactions must occur, thereby removing any competitive
incentive, or precluse brokers, dealers and underwriters from
engaging in them.
The validity of those agreements is what is at issue
in this case.
Now, the case is here on motion to dismiss9 so that
the allegations of the complaint of course must be accepted as
true and construed in the government's favor in determining

whether there’s any state of facts that the government might
prove -that would entitle it to any relief.

Not necessarily

the precise relief requested in the complaint but any relief.
And though there are some variations, the essence of
counts two, four, six and eight is that underwriters and
dealers have included in their dealer contracts various
restrictive provisions which either require the dealers to act
as dealers in their transactions, therefore subjecting them­
selves to the fixed price of 22(d)? or, that if they do act as
brokers, require that they maintain that fixed price, or
preclude them from dealing with other broker dealers.
Counts three, five and seven allege that mutual
funds have engaged in —- entered into underwriting agreements
containing provisions that either require the underwriters to
impose these restrictive provisions in their dealer contracts
or have imposed other restraints on the underwriter's ability
to engage in competitive transactions.
Count one of the complaint alleges that NASD and its
members, including underwriters and broker-dealers, hav com­
bined to restrain the development of competitive secondary
interdealer markets and brokerage markets through a variety of
means.
Let me make it clear that when we talk about a
secondary dealer market in the complaint and in this case
we're talking about the market between dealers:

contract

12
dealer to a non-contract dealer? or an investor's sale to a
dealer.

We are not talking about a dealer's sale to an investor.

There's some suggestion on the other side that that is the
market vie're trying to develop or redevelop in this case? that
is not true.
As the complaint was later clarified, we are not
challenging in the complaint any rules adopted by -die NASD.
It is asserted that those rules deal only with the primary
distribution system and the complaint here is directed at the
secondary markets.
None of these restrictions that we are challenging
is required by any rule of the Commission or of any rule of the
NASD,
Defendants acknowledge that they have -the burden of
establishing some implied exception to the antitrust laws,
because there's no express exception, and 'they therefore must
overcome the strong presumption against implied repeal of the
antitrue t laws.
In this effort, they contend that 22(d) was intended
by Congress to eradicate secondary markets that had existed
prior to 1940, and to require that all transactions in mutual
fund shares be at the fixed prices.
They also claim that Congress intended section 22(f)
to permit the funds, underwriters and dealers to make private
arrangements which would restrict any other competition in

13

this secondary market area that '-'as not precluded by 22(d),
Building on these premises, the defendants claim that
the entire distribution, sale, and redemption process of mutual
fund sales, including secondary market transactions is covered
by an implied immunity because of the exclusive jurisdiction,
they say, of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The district court agreed and granted their motion
to dismiss.
I should note that the district court did not deal
with any of the factual submissions made by the parties on
various aspects of the case, and treated the motion as raising
strictly legal questions, and the various factual issues are,
of course, not before the court.
He don't believe -that the language of section 22(d),
with its plain inapplicability to interdealer transactions or
to broker transactions, or the language of 22(f) will bear the
weight of the defendants' argument as to its sweeping purpose
and effect.
Our more limited reading of these sections is con­
firmed by their legislative history, and I think it's
important to place the Act in context.
The defendants v/ould have the Court think that the
Act was enacted because mutual funds wanted protection from the
secondary market competition, v/hich they were troubled by.
It's quite the contrary.

The Act was thrust upon the industry

14
as a response to revelation of a variety of abuses that had
developed by funds in the 1920’s and '30's.
In 1939 the SEC submitted to Congress a study, 3500-”
page study, the result of four years of intensive investigation,
which revealed a wide variety of abuses by mutual funds»

And

the principal abuses are reflected in Congress's findings in
section 1(b) of the Act.

They involve such matters as

inadequate disclosure to investors, discriminatory treatment of
different classes of investors, favoritism of insiders, undue
speculation.
They are all abuses of the mutual funds» There’s not
a single one that involves abuses by secondary market dealers.
Which the other side would have the Court believe was -the
target of the Act.
Defendants’ reference to the legislative history is
rather dubious, because they can cite no single instance in
which any person said that 22(d) or 22(f) was aimed at
restricting the secondary market.
In the course of the vast investment company study,
there is a half a page, a single paragraph, which we've quoted
in its entirety at page 32 of our brief, which refers to what
the industry, not the Commission, called a bootleg market.
This was a market involving some secondary market dealers who
would be buying at somewhat above the net asset value and
selling at somewhat below the public offering price.

And as the report stated, they started a small price
war.
QUESTION;

Suppose the Securities and Exchange

Commission had promulgated a rule under 22(f) that brokers —
or that funds should restrict the transferability of their
shares, so that brokers as well as dealers couldn't sell to
investors at anything less than the offering price.

Would you

— I suppose your argument would be that that regulation would
be, or that rule would be invalid.
MR. MORTON;

Well, that hasn’t been presented.

On

the face of it, I think that would go beyond the power the
Commission has under 22(f).

And, in any event, -they have not

done so.
It is clear that these restrictions are not the
result of any rule that the Commission has promulgated.
QUESTION;

Yes, but the argument is that -- the

argument on the other side, I take it, among other -things, is
that the Commission would have power to do such a thing.
And that the — it’s the Commission that has the exclusive
power to «—
MR. NORTON;
QUESTION;

Well —
—to deal with this matter, and that

the power of the Commission preempts the antitrust laws.
MR, NORTON;

That is the argument,

One problem with

that argument is that the Commission, prior to this case,

16

never exercised its authority tinder 22(f) in any respect.
QUESTION; Well, the Commission -*~
MR. NORTON;

It never indicated in any way that it

had the expansive view of its jurisdiction that the defendants,
and to some extent the Commission now, now claim.
QUESTION;

Well, the Commission is now asserting it,

MR. NORTON:

It's not saying that it could require

isn't it?

the industry to impose these restrictive agreements, it's saying
that it has some authority to regulate them, because it says
these agreements may be treated as if they were restrictions
on the transferability of the shares.
QUESTION;

All right.

Suppose the funds did ironose

this restriction and the Commission expressly approved it;
expressly approved those restrictions, such as we've been
talking about?
I would suggest the Commission says at least that, that
would preempt antitrust laws.
MR. NORTON;

Well, I suspect that would be their

position
QUESTION;
MR. NORTON:

Well, it is here, isn't it?
Well, they haven’t expressed the

approval, so they can't really take that position.
Rut I think their position leans in that direction.
But we would not agree, because that would present the different

17
case referred to in Silver, as to which the Court has not
given any definitive answer.
QUESTION: But they say they could do that, and if
they could, that means that although the power is unexercised,
the power is there and it should not be interfered with by
antitrust prosecution,
MR. NORTON:

Well, that's true.

involves several problems.

But of course this

One is that they are trying to

convert agency inaction into some evidence of affirmative
approval, and that is something that there’s no basis for here.
If the Commission had been exercising a broad juris­
diction under 22 (f) and had been actually reviewing these
agreements since 1940, and passing some kind of relevant
judgment on them, they might have a stronger argument.
But the fact is that they were not, that these
that the restrictive agreements are contained in underwriting
and dealer contracts, not in registration statements„

They

are filed with those statements, but they are not reviewed in
any way that is relevant co whether there should be antitrust
immunity.
In fact, if you look at 22(f), the standard under
22(f) is extremely narrow.

It’s not a question of whether

restrictions are in -the public interest.

The Commission is

authorised to prescribe regulations in the interest of all
holders of outstanding shares.

18
Nowf that may or may not. involve any competitive
implications.
J

And this Court has never found implied immunity
based on agency review or agency jurisdictione

And where the

agency hasn’t had to give some consideration to antitrust or
competitive considerations.

And there is no, nothing in the

face of 22(f) that requires the Commission to do so.
Now, whether 22(f) night be construed to authorize
that broad review is another matter, but it's perfectly clear
that it has not been so construed and applied by the Commission
since 1940„
QUESTION: Well, isn’t one of your arguments that
a secondary market would benefit the holders of these secur­
ities?
MR* NORTON:

It would benefit the holders, but it

would benefit people who were not yet holders.
QUESTION: Well, then, when this 22(f) says the
Commission has to act in the interest of all the holders,
wouldn’t it have to take into consideration the fact, if you're
right, that a secondary market would benefit some of the holders?
MR. NORTON:

We would not argue that the Commission

ought not to take competitive factors into consideration, but
what we’ re saying is that this is a view of 22(f) which is
novel, it has not been the way the Act, the section has been
applied.

So that the fact that the Commission has had all of

19

these agreements filed with it, if that is the fact, and has
taken no action, is of no significance, because the Commission
has not been giving them any kind of review that is relevant.
They have not been applying that standard in the past.
But let me just address 22(f) in terms of its
legislative his tors'.
The defendants would have — they argue that 22(f)
gave general validity to any restrictions in legislation
statements endorsed by the fund that were not contrary to some
explicit Commission rule.
Now, there is absolutely no support for that reading
of 22(f) in the legislative history.
22(f) was intended to restrict the

ability of funds

to impose such restrictions by requiring that they be
disclosed so that investors know that if they buy a mutual
fund there may be some limitation on its transferability.
The funds involved in this case do not have limita­
tions on their transferability.

They're rully transferable

under the same manner as any other security.
The restrictions here go to the distribution system,
not to the transferability or negotiability of the fund.
Those are technical terms used in a technical statute, and
there is simply no basis for thinking chat Congress would ,have
used them to encompass a variety of contractual limitations, of
which it had notice, and still use the narrow language.

20
But;, anyway, the — 22(f) stems from the Commission's
intent to restrict the activities of the funds.

It was not

imposed or suggested by the funds as a means of enabling them
to deal with a secondary market.
history/ they opposed 22(f).

Indeed,, in the legislative

They now say it is their

salvation/ that they didn't want it? and it was adopted only
as a result of the compromise between the Commission and the
funds that led to the final Act.
Our position^ and we think it is the only way that
22(f) can be read consistently with this Court's position to
questions of implied repeal,is that 22(f), particularly where
the Commission has taken no action, has no effect on the
validity of restrictions that are within its terms under other
federal or State laws»
If they were unlawful under some federal or State law
prior to'1940, they would be unlawful after 1940.
were not unlawful, then no effect.

If they

It left them where they

stood.
All it did was impose additional requirements;

a

requirement of disclosure in the registration statement; and a
requirement that they comply with any additional rules that the
Commission might adopt.
Of course, the Commission has never adopted any such
rules.
Let me just — while we're on 22(f) , the idea that

21

the filing of a contract, as an exhibit to a registration
statement, is the same as inclusion of it in the registration
statement, is also unfounded here.
The registration statement is intended, with the
prospectus that incorporates most of it, to inform investors.
The exhibits and all of the technical matters that are filed
with the Commission don't all get sent out to the investors.
So that an investor might well buy a mutual fund on the basis
of a prospectus saying its shares are fully transferable, and
then find that there are contractual restrictions on who we
can buy and sell to.
So, not only does 22(f) not validate any limitations,
the type of restrictions here, contained in the contracts, are
simply not within its terms.
Now, let me return to 22(d),
The defendants say that 22(d) intended to impose
resale price maintenance on all transactions.
Again, there is not —- and to restrict the competi­
tion of the secondary market — there is nothing in the legis­
lative history that supports that purpose»
22 (d) was first proposed by the industry as a means
of dealing with insider trading.

No reference to secondary

market transactions»
It was then incorporated in a compromise measure that
resulted in the revised bill that was then enacted without

22
change.

Again no reference to secondary markets.

There is

not a reference to secondary markets in the Committee Reports
or in the debates.

It was simply not a word in the pertinent

legislative history that supports the defendants' attribution
of pvrpose.
Now, we say that the language of 22(d) is perfectly
clear.

It does not apply to interdealer transactions, and it

does not apply to brokerage transactions.
On tills the Commission agrees with us and has
explicitly taken the position in its amicus brief here that the
district court was wrong to the extent that it read 22(d) as
requiring resale price maintenance in all such transactions.
That has been the Commission's consistent view, and
first announced contemporaneous with the enactment of the
statute.

It's entitled, of course, to the i^eight, the great

weight that such interpretations normally receive.
Now, in mentioning the Commission's interpretation,
and its reiteration of that interpretation in this brief, I
think it fairly shows that the defendants' argument, based on
certain legislative history concerning the 1970 amendments to
the Investment Company Act, in which 22(d) was reenacted without
any material change, and certain prior legislative proposals
that were not enacted, simply is of no relevance to the question
of what 22(d) means.
The Commission's interpretation has been consistent

23
and has been unaffected, and the statements that the other side
has relied upon in that legislative history, and we have
addressed in our reply brief, simply did not deal with the
precise questions before the Court in this case.
Now, one of the arguments that the defendants make
in trying to say that 22(d) ought not be construed to permit a
brokerage market to flourish is that such a market would be
impractical.
Well, the major preraise is obviously unacceptable
because legality is not governed by practicability.
But even the question of practicability, we cannot
accept the defendants' premise.
If such a market were so impractical, then why did
they go to such elaborate lengths to preclude it through
contractual agreements?
If it's so impractical, why has the Commission under­
taken, in a 1974 report to which the parties have made great
reference, to permit such a market to develop?
There is simply no basis for saying that this market
cannot exist under 22(d) because it would be impractical.
QUESTION:

Mr. Norton, has there been any congres­

sional reaction to that '74 study?
MR» NORTON:

I am not in a position to say.

Let me return to the Commission's role under 22(f),
because that has a bearing on the question of immunity.

24
As I've indicated, the Commission, for 35 years, has I
not been playing an active role in reviewing these agreements
that are filed with it under 22(f), and certainly has not been
reviewing them with antitrust competitive principles in mind.
That, in itself, and the fact that there is no

V

obligation on the Commission to consider competitive conse~
quences, removes one of the essential conditions for a finding
of a broad implied immunity„
As I said, this Court, to my knowledge, has never found
such an immunity to exist where the agency did not have an
obligation to review matters with some kind of comeptitive
considerations as part of the mix of its regulatory factors.
QUESTION:

If this has been going on for 35 years,

why did the government wait so long to bring -this suit?
MR„ MORTON:

Well, there is -- I think until the

early Sixties it was less clear to everyone that these
securities transactions were fully subject to the antitrust
laws.

And the practices were —
QUESTION: What happened in -the early Sixties that made

it more clear?
MR. HORTON: Well, there was the Silver case, for one,
and there was also, with particular reference to the securities
industry, in 196 3 or so, a study which revealed a lot of the
competitive problems of the industry»

And this basically set

in motion a lot of thinking in consideration of these problems.

In addition, as to the brokerage market, for
example, as mentioned, as a practical matter, it. may have
required computer development before it became as feasible as
it might be now.
Of course, we are seeking here injunctive relief only.
A further problem with the immunity argument of the
other side is that there is really no Commission proceeding

/

in which the allegations of the complaint and the conduct
that is challenged in this case could be considered.

I think

it’s highly significant that the Commission itself, while it
supports the defendants as to Counts two through eight, and
says that under its present reading of 22(f) all of those
agreements come within its jurisdiction, it does not support
them as to count one.

It makes no claim that the allegations

of count one are within its jurisdiction, and makes no claim
that those allegations are covered by some kind of antitrust
immunity.
QUESTION:

Mr. Morton, would you summarise very

briefly the essential difference between count one, what the
government is driving at there, as contrasted with the
practical consequences of what it is seeking in the other
counts?
In other words, suppose you won on count one and lost
on the others, and vice vera.
MR. NORTON:

What would the results be?

Well, I think it's hard to give a precise

26

answer to that, because count one is a broad horizontal type
of combination which has, as its focus the — among other
things, the development of these vertical arrangements which are
challenged in counts two through eight.

So they are somewhat

interrelated,
QUESTION: Specifically what types of agreements would
count one address that are different from the agreements
addressed by the other counts?
MR. NORTON:

Well, count one referred to other matters,

such as discouraging people who — a number of things to
suppress the development of a secondary market, in addition to
the contract.

Such as discouraging people who might be

interested in engaging in such a market, by saying, suggesting
that it was not lawful.

Or distributing information that mis-

characterized the legality of such transactions.
But it's supplemental to —
QUESTION:

Would information like that violate the

antitrust laws if it were erroneous?
In other words, the brokers and dealers would have
lawyers to advise them whether or not the NASD information was
correct or not.
QUESTION:

On problem in answering on count one is

that we're here on a motion to dismiss.
facts.

We don't have the

But there are some indications in the record that are

suggestive.

Government. Exhibit 13, which is an interoffice

27

memorandum for the Crosby Corporation in 1970, refers to the
problem of dealers buying from the investors and selling
again,not redeeming.

And it addresses the question whether

such restriction — the dealer agreements should be amended to
preclude those transactions.
And indicates an awareness that to do so would raise
serious questions under the antitrust laws.

And there is

knowledge that going beyond the bounds of 22(d) presents
serious antitrust questions.

So that it's not as if they

were babes in the woods.
Another exhibit, Government Exhibit 12 — 13 is at
page 276 of the Appendix, 12, the last page, at 266 — which is
another interoffice memorandum in 1950, talks about the
importance of eliminating the competitive business, and
knitting together, in a coordinated campaign, to cut down
on competitive street markets.
We don't know what else
of the complaint.

there may be behind the face

We haven't had discovery yet.

So I just

can't give you a definitive answer.
But the activities challenged in count one
supplement and reinforce and give broader effect to the
agreements

challenged in counts two through eight.
Now, the test, of course, under Silver, on the

question of immunity is whether immunity as to particular
challenged transactions is necessary to make the regulatory

23
Act work, and even then immunity is implied only to the minimum
extent necessary to do so, and there is no showing here that the
kind of sweeping immunity for all kinds of restraints on
secondary markets, that are comprehended by the complaint satisfy
either of the Silver tests.
As I

beginning to say earlier, the Commission

simply has no appropriate authority to review the kinds of
activities that are challenged in the complaint.

22(d) provides

it with no jurisdiction, it has no function under 22(d) except —

Oh, yes.

No.

No.

HR, NORTON; That’s right.
QUESTION;

Then you say the primary market is ended,

through a broker or directly.
MR, NORTON;

MR. NORTON:

MR. NORTON:

That's precisely right.

QUESTION: So it just isn't a question of ~~ well,
you say that the primary market just can’t reach out and keep
investors from selling to another one at as low a price, even
though the fund is continuously offering its new shares?
MR. NORTON;

That's right.

Nov;, of course, if the fund suspends offering, as
some do from time to time, then the whole resale price
maintenance is out.
And let me point out, the agreements here don't limit
their provisions to times when the fund is continuously
offering.
That may be the norm, but that is not -the condition

30

set forth in the agreements *
QUESTION;

Mr. Norton, I thought the funds did offer

continuously, because they are obligated to buy back continuously.
MR. NORTON;
question about that.

Well, they generally do.

There's no

But they're not obliged to.

They are obliged, by law, to redeem them at any time?
they're not obliged by lav; to continuously offer.

And there

are some — some have been closed up for decades.
QUESTION: That.would be a liquidation.
MR. NORTON;

Not necessarily, no.

They have good

results, they may just have their shares traded in the secondary
market.

If they're doing well, people will trade there

rather than redeem.
QUESTION: Returning to a question that Mr. Justice
Marshall asked earlier, isn't the fundamental problem the
estent of the locid, and the SEC does have authority to regulate
that?
MR. NORTON: They have authority to regulate that in
tha primary distribution system.

It is tied with the resale

— the same scope as the resale price maintenance.
QUESTION;

But if the load were fair, what would be

the advantage of having the secondary, the free secondary
market that you speak of?
MR. NORTON;

Well, at present the investor has to

31
pay tiie load whether or not the dealer performs any services.
The sales load in mutual funds reflects the large selling
expense, but if you've already bought a fund, you know about
mutual funds, and you don't need to he sold on them; all you
need is the mechanics to be taken care of ~
QUESTION:
.UR. NORTON:

But the percentage
-- why should you have to pay full

sales load when, if you could go to a broker you could buy the
shares that somebody else down the street is trying to sell.
QUESTION:

what is it, R.5 percent?

MR. NORTON: Eight and a half percent.
QUESTION:

It's sizable.

But. your problem is still -- this

situation still exists, not perhaps to the Seine extent,even
if there was no sales load.

Because investors may want to sell,

and other people may buy at less than the net asset value.
QUESTION: That's right.
MR. NORTON: That's right.

It's not just the load,

it's the
QUESTION;
MR* NORTON:

Yes„
— the freedom of option which is very

basic in the competitive system.
The final consideration on the question of immunity
is that it's essential that -there be some conflict.
Nov;, there is no conflict here.

There's certainly

no conflict with anything the Commission has done in the past.

32
As to the future,- the purpose of this suit is
consistent with the Commission's proposals in its 1974 report.
They want to end these contractual limitations# too. Co
there’s no conflict there.
There's no conflict either with the Commission’s
proposals to permit funds to impose transfer fees and other
measures.

They are just not in conflict.
Now# going beyond that# the defendants suggest# well#

there may be some possibility of conflict between something that
the Court here might require and something that the Commission
might require some day.
QUESTION: What is it — but an investor can always
redeem at net asset value# can’t he?
MR. NORTON: That’s right, but. it’s net asset value
at the date of receipt by the fund.

If ha wants to get cash

quickly# and at a more certain price# he may want to redeem
on the secondary market.
QUESTION: Rut then he may have to pay a brokerage
commission?
MR. NORTON: Well# it depends —
QUESTION:

I mean# he doesn’t know any other

investor to —
MR. NORTON:

Just talks with the dealer, and pays

whatever the market price was.
If he goes to a broker# there would be a small

commission.
But as to tills remote possibility of some future
conflict/ of course the Court held in Silver and in Gulf States
Otter Tail/ rather» that that is not sufficient; you need
an actual conflict.
In addition/ we don't have a judgment here. The
judgment, if and when it is entered/ could take into account
the possibility that the Commission might act differently
in the future/ and could accommodate the possibility of some
overlap of jurisdiction.
So we believe that none of the conditions of implied
immunity is satisfied here, and that the defendants'

restraints

are not justified and certainly not required by 22(d) or 22(f),
and that ’die judgment of the district court should be reversed.
I'd like to reserve die balance of my time.
QUESTION: Nell, I take it, fir. Norton, you and the
Solicitor General, or the Antitrust Division and the Solicitor
General on the one hand and die SEC on the other couldn't
settle their differences? in this case.
MR. NORTON:
QUESTION:

That would appear to be the situation.
But the SEC is here just as an amicus?

Mr. Norton, you've

34
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEE LOEVIHGER, ESQ„,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR.LOEVIHGER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
In the first of the great antitrust cases in the
securities industry, Judge Medina, back in 1953, observed:
"the initial inquiry into any antitrust case must be in the
character and background of the industry involved."
Now, Mr. Norton has sketched very nicely the character
and the operation of mutual funds, with a few points I may tales
exception to? however, he has not undertaken to examine the
character of the securities industry.
Now, although there’s a limited record here,
fortunately, all of the facts of significance are matters of
public record.

In 196 3 there was a special study of the

securities market, which has been referred to by this Court,
cited in Silver and in Cartwright and in other cases, and
therefore I have had reference to that as a source of available
information.

And my information concerning the market comes

from that,
There are two basic types of markets.
First, the initial issue market for distribution of
securities into public hands, which is usually handled through
underwriters.
And the second, trading markets for continuous

trading in outstanding securities.

The special study says the

uses and mechanisms of trading markets are substantially
different from those of distribution markets.
The term "primary" is sometimes used to refer to the
original issue market, and the terra "secondary'' to the secondarytrading markets; and the terms are so used in this case.
There are, however, two types of trading markets,
exchanges and over-the-counter markets.
The special study says that these are fundamentally
similar in purpose and function, but substantially dissimilar
in mechanics and practices.
In the exchange markets there is a physical congre­
gation of buyers and sellers, represented by brokers, an the
floor of the Exchanges, and actually at physical locations
within the Exchanges.
There is continuous auction trading with buying and
selling, and the price fluctuating according to supply and
demand.

Trades are executed quickly, often within minutes of

the time the order is given.

The market could function solely

as a nexus for matching public orders to buy and sell, although
there are dealers on ths market to handle odd lots and perform
various other functions.
The over-the-counter markets, in contrast, have no
physical place of congregation. The special study says that
such markets exist only as and to the extent that dealers elect

36

to make -them by standing ready to buy and sell for their own
accounts.

These dealers are market makers, and in the over-the-

counter markets there is no mechanism for matching public
orders , so that the market makers are the over-the-counter
equivalent of the nexus between buyers and sellers provided
by the Exchange floor»
There is also something called a third market which
consists of stocks listed on an Exchange blotter sold over-thecounter? tliis exists almost exclusively to serve the needs of
very large institutional investors, often trading tens of
thousands of shares worth millions of dollars and occasionally
these are broker transactions because there's enough involved
so that they can go out and look for buyers or sellers to match
the orders.
There has also been some discussion recently of a
so-called electronic market, resulting, as Mr, Norton has said,
from recent developments of computer technology and electronic
communication, and it has made theoretically possible the
combination of the New York Stock Exchange, the regional
subsidiary exchanges, and possibly even of over-the-counter
markets»
Whatever the merits or demerits of the so-called
electronic market, they lie wholly in the future and are
entirely theoretical, have nothing to do with this case because
they never have existed, are not yet in existence.

.37

How, as Mr, Norton has said, -there are various types
of mutual funds of open-ended managment investment companies.
However, this case is concerned with only one type,
open-end management investment companies engaged in continuous
sale of their shares.

Ue are not concerned with the so-called

closed-end or xtfith the closed-up funds.
Hr. Norton said that there may be occasions when an
open-end company is closed up.

That may very well be, but

on those occasions the sales agreements to which he objects
are no longer in effect.

So those are completely out of the

case.
In any event, all of the defendants here are openend funds that have never been closed up, and so we are not
concerned with any closed-up funds.
Mutual funds have been well analyzed and described
in both the majority and dissenting opinions in the United
States vs. Cartwright, so that this Court is presumably familiar
with them as a means of providing a diversified investment
portfolio and management service, mainly for small individuals
and institutional investors.

They have, as was said, the

unique characteristics of being continuously offered through
underwritings and primary distribution, and of being required
to buy back any outstanding shares at any time at the net
asset value.
Thus, the price of funds is not set as are the price

3S
of almost other securities by supply and demand.

In the first

place, the supply is practically unlimited, so there would be
no limitation on that side of the equation.

In the second

place, the price depends upon the net asset value which is
based on the market value of the underlying portfolio
securities.
This is simply determined mathematically by a clerk
in the office. There is no management discretion involved,
it's a pure mathematical computation.
Furthermore, although the government talks about a
restriction or restraint of competition here, there is vigorous
competition between funds based on performance portfolio
selection, type and nature of operation, and various ether
characteristics.

Thera is vigorous interfund competition, and

there is no contention to the contrary here.
QUESTIONs

But they don't ~~ they don't compete in

terms of the load percentage, do they?
MR. LOEVINGSR:

Yes, they do, because some funds have

higher loads, other funds have no loads, some funds have zero
loads.
There is competition between funds — between funds
as to loads.

The government is addressing its case solely to

the fact that as to, within the

organization of a single fund,
s'

the dealers

engaged in the distribution of a single fund

do not compete at the load.

That's the whole government case

here.

They

As a matter

of fact, there is a pending NASD rule that sets a maximums
of 8.5 percent with things scaled down according to variou
contingencies.

This has been given tentative approval by the

SEC and will go into effect fairly shortly»
QUESTION:

And you’re say there are some with open-

MR. LOBVINGER:
QUES TION:

Yes, sir.

MR. LOEVINGER:

QUESTION:

MR. LOEVINGER:

Well, there are open-end no load

funds on the market.
QUESTION: Well, where is the ~~ how can —
MR* LOEVINGER:
QUESTION:

By standards, no load funds.

How can that economically be?

MR. LOEVINGER:

Yes.

That's a very good question, Mr,

Justice, and that brings me to the next point which is that

40

mutual funds are and have been# as found by the SEC,, dependent
upon their primary distribution system.
By the large, the demand for fund shares is the result
of advertising and sales promotion efforts by the underwriters
and the dealers.
Furthermore, for funds that do have loads and are
thus dependent, continuous cash flow from their sales is
necessary to provide the cash for redemption, Without such
continuing sales, the funds would be forced to sell their
portfolio of securities in order to meet the demands for
redemption. This would tend to depress the markets and ultimately
make the funds self liquidating.
This method of distribution,

incidentally, is

rather logical for mutual funds, because, as I've mentioned,
trading markets exist to redistribute outstanding shares
previously distributed by the issuer.

For most securities

this is, as Mr. Norton correctly said, the most important
market.
However, since mutual funds are continuously being
issued and repurchased by the issuer, there is no function for
the secondary market to perform at all analogous to the
secondary market trading function for other securities.
And, as noted in Cartwright, this method of distri­
bution is now mandated by statute, and under the statutory
scheme, the redemption of shares by funds is the market and the

41
only market for investors.
Now, before 1940, when the Investment Company Act
was passed, there was a secondary dealers market in mutual
funds by non-contract dealers, which was referred to as the
bootleg market.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. LOEVINGER:

Non-contract dealers would buy from

stockholders at slightly below the net asset value and resell
to investors at slightly below the public offering

price.

They could do this because they eliminated the underwriting
fee which at that time was substantially higher than it is
today.
There never has been, prior to 1940 or since then,
a secondary brokerage market in mutual funds.

This simply

has been nonexistent, for two compelling reasons.
First, it has been functionally impractical, because
there was simply no way for brokers to function in an over-thecounter market except on very large transactions where the
brokerage commission would enable them to go out and search
for buyers or sellers.
Incidentally, it's unethical for brokers to seek to
get fund investors to sell their fund shares, because they're
regarded as long-term investments.
Second is that it has been economically

unprofitable

because the brokerage commissions have always been less than

42

the dealers' mark-ups on mutual funds.
Now, in 1935, Congress directed an extensive study
of investment companies and after four years the SEC submitted
it investment study to Congress, as a result of which Congress,
in 1940, enacted the Investment lompany Act.
The congressional intent, contrary to the representstions of the government, clearly was to restrain and inhibit the
grov/th of a secondary trading market in mutual fund shares in
order to maintain the primary distribution system and protect
it against disruption.
Mr, Norton has suggested that there is no testimony
to tills effect,

I suggest that the testimony of Mr. Schenker,

the director of the Investment Trust Study, which can be found
in the dealers' brief, which is the big red one, at page .31,
specifically mentions the bootleg market» This was mentioned in
the Investment Trust Study and there is, as we demonstrated at
considerable length in our brief, a legislative background
showing that in fact the suppression of the bootleg market
was one of the purposes of the Investment Company Act,
QUESTION;

Whatever became e>£ the proposal that

this problem be dealt with by forward pricing?
MR. LOEVINGBR;

That has been implemented by the SEC,

it was implemented in 1969, Mr. Justice, by an SEC rule requiring
forward pricing, which is new the present practice.
Therefore the problem of dilution resulting from

forward pricing has been totally eliminated, and when Congress
re-enacted Section 22(d) in 1970, it had no such problem before
it? which again reinforqes the same conclusion.
In any event, in the Investment Company Act there
was simple provision for the regulation of mutual fund sales
and distribution.

22(a) referred to the method of pricing,

gave the NASD and the SEC the power to pass such rules.
22(b) gave the NASD and the SEC power to regulate
mutual fund loads..
22(d) provided the mutual fund shares to be sold to
investors only at a current public offering price, which, in
effect, protected the sales load or sa3.es merging against the
price cutting of a secondary market? and 22(f) authorized
restrictions on transferability and negotiability of fund
shares which were fully disclosed to the Sec and not disapproved.
The SEC says in its brief that it was the intention
of Congress to regulate, through section 22(f), restrictions on
secondary market activities in mutual fund shares, and we
fully agree with that position.
QUESTIONS Well, I guess you will get to it, but you
— wholly aside from 22(f), I suppose you’re saying that 22(d)
or 22(d) and 22(f) together mean that the primary

means

that there is only supposed to be a primary market.
MR. LOEVINGER:
Mr, Justice.

They eliminated the secondary market,

44
QUESTION;

Wholly asids from the power of the SEC?

MR. LOEVINGER?.

As a practical matter, yes, they did

eliminate the secondary market»
Incidentally, the SEC -QUESTION: Well, let's assume we disagreed with you on
22(d), that just by, on its face or in light of its legislative
history, 22(d) standing alone didn't eliminate the secondary
market, and then we are left with the argument that the powers
of the SEC under 22(f) are sufficient to preempt the antitrust
laws „
MR. LOEVINGER:
QUESTION:

Well, then, the —»

Well, do you

are you saying that 22(f)

alone has that power?
MR. LOEVINGER:
QUESTION:
if you have to?

We needn't rest on that, sir.

The --

I know you don't «*- you needn't, but what

And what if v/e

MR. LOEVINGER:

Of course, as a practical matter,

the powers of the SEC under 22(f) are perfectly adequate in
this case. They answer the question asked by Mr. Justice Powell.
As a practical matter, all of the restrictions the government
is complaining about are in fact contained in the agreements,
and if the SEC made regulations under 22(f), that would, as a
practical matter, end the case.
However, there is ample authority under other sections
Under 22(b) there is an express antitrust exemption, for control

45
of sales loads by the SEC and by the NASD.

22(d) sets the

price, however, section 6(c) of the Investment Company Act
gives the SEC full exemptive power, as the Department of
Justice has often urged

before the SEC.

So that the SEC, and

section 38 gives the SEC power to promulgate any rules and
regulations it likes, to implement the other sections of the
Act.
So the SEC has plenary power to control all of the
matters that are in discussion here.
Furthermore, —
QUESTION:

But it hasn’t.

MR. LOEVINGER:

— the history —

QUESTION: But it hasn't.
MR. LOEVINGER:

But it hasn’t.

Yes, it has, sir, to a large extent.

In the 1974 report, as the SEC points out, all of these
matters are discussed.

There are proposals relating to every

single thing the government has under discussion, and there
are

some of them have been ~~ some of them are in the form

of tentative rules; others in the form of recommendations for
no action, but they have all been thoroughly discussed,
considered, and are the subject of either past or pending action
by the SEC.

___ -

I submit, Mr. Justice, that history' has in fact
answered your question as to the effect of 22(d) and 22(f),
There is a very active secondary dealer market up to the time

46

of passage of the Investment Company Act in 1940.

It has been

estimated it was approximately as large , perhaps a trifle
larger, than the primary distribution market,.
Since 1940 the secondary market has disappeared
except for what -fire SEC refers to as miniscule market, and
which all parties agree amount to less than one-tenth of one
percent of the total market? and that has been entirely the
result of the passage of the Investment Company Act,,
QUESTIONS Well, of course, the government says part
of the reason it's disappeared is because of the agreements
among your clients.
MR. XiOEVIHGSRs

Those existed prior to 1940, Mr,

Justice.
If it hadn't — the only thing that changed in 1940
was the passage of the Investment Company Act.

Consequently,

it’s the only thing to which we can attribute the disappearance
of the secondary market.
Furthermore, the protests from the secondary market
dealers which are in the record, largely as government exhibits,
show that in fact these were — that this was what the seconary
market dealers saw as driving them out of business.
The reason for this is fairly simple, you see,
because, as I explained, you have to understand the mechanism
of the market.

In the secondary markets, secondary trading

markets, there are not brokers for transactions of this kind.

47
There are only dealers»
The government admits, both in its main and in its
reply briefs, as I recall it's page 2 of their rep3.y brief ,
that section 22(d) applies to all sales by all dealers,
regardless of the capacity in which they're acting, or the
market in which they’re acting»
Since secondary market dealers cannot offer an
investor any advantage in selling price, there is simply no
function for the secondary market any more. Therefore, the
Investment Company Act wiped out the secondary market in 1940,
and it exists as a miniscule thing or a curiosity, I assume
largely as a matter of convenience among dealers and for other
peripheral things? but obviously not of any real importance®
QUESTION;

Just to make it clear, let’s assume that

an investor has bought some shares in a mutual fund and he
wants to get rid of if, let’s assume he just sells to a dealer,
and the dealer buys it for his own account®

Now, if he does

that, if he wants to sell to an investor, he must sell at the
offering price?
MR, LOEVINGER:

No, the »•- oh, I’m sorry, if the

dealer wants to sell? yes, sir.
QUESTION; Yes.
MR. LOEVINGER;
QUESTION;

The dealers must sell at the —

Even though an investor has previously

MR» LOEVINGER:

Yes, sir»

That's conceded by the

government»
QUESTION :

Yes.

MR. LOEVINGER:
QUESTION:

Ho question about that.

Well, what if such an investor just wants

to sell his shares to a fried and they say, Well, we'll just
split the difference between the redemption cost and the
offering price?
MR. LOEVINGER:

It’s perfectly proper, there’s no

law against it, no rule against it, no restriction against it;
it's not involved in the case.
QUESTION: And if he goes through a broker it is
involved, hunh ?
MR* LOEVINGER:

There is some question as to whether

or not 22(d) reaches the case of a broker who is not in fact
a dealer, and acts only as a broker between two investors?
but again that's a pure abstraction, it's the most
exceptional case, it’s something ~— the only case that has ever
come to light of that kind is the Oxford case, which involves
the most extraordinary circumstances? perfectly, obviously,
redolent of fraud, an overreaching on the part of a small firm
that had two customers, and substantially only two customers,
and it sold fund shares for one at the same time it bought the
same fund shares for the other, and attempted to charge the
full spread.

And the SEC said you couldn't get away with it.

49

But there is nothing in there to indicate that it had
ever acted as a dealer*
QUESTION? Well, let's assume that — you may be
right, that it hardly ever happens? but are you saying that -the
Act, 22(d) and 22(f) would exempt the NASD from any antitrust
liability and the brokers, if -they'll agreed, "Well, we will
just never help an investor sell to another investor"?
MR» LOEVTNGER;

There's no charge that they have

done this.
QUESTION: Well, but —
MR. LOEVINGERs

The only charge is that the contract

by the —
MR. LOEVINGER:

I think it would be, sir.

Because

these are so — there is such a pervasive system of regulation
by the SEC, it is impossible to conceive of any practice that
any of the dealers or brokers or underwriters could engage in
here that is not subject to SEC control»
QUESTION; Well, I -thought part of the government's
case was that that NASD and the formal system was suppressing
any kind of a development of a secondary market through
brokers.
MR. LOEVINGER:

There is a formal allegation to this

50

effect, but in fact it has been largely abandoned.

This formal

allegation rests upon the assertion that NASD rules have this
effect, but they have now retrated from that allegation and
thereby substantially x^ithdrawn their count one charges.
As a matter of fact, government Exhibits 12 and 13,
that Mr, Norton referred to, are concerned exclusively with
vertical restrictions and not horizontal restrictions.
QUESTION?

Well, you’re suggesting this is just a

non-case.
MR. LOEVINGER;

I believe that is precisely the

instance, Mr, Justice.
QUESTIONs

Wall, certainly Mr. Norton, in his response

to Justice Powell’s question, didn't indicate that the govern­
ment had withdrawn count one.
MR. LOEVINGERs

I know he didn't.

But in fact they

have, because all of the substantial allegations have been
abandoned,
QUESTIONs Well, how — when you talk about someone
withdrawing a portion of their case, I would assume you'd
take their word rather than opposing counsel’s, ordinarily.
MR.LOEVINGER;

The government is very anxious to have

the case reversed and to prevail, sir.

But there is nothing

left of count one after they have abandoned the charge that the
NASD rules violata the antitrust Xax*s.
The count one doesn’t stand in the record simply on

51
its bare

in the first place, the things that they are

talking about here, and in their brief, which refer to 'the
refusal of

broker-dealers to soli to secondary market

dealers, don't appear in count one of the complaint, as it was
drafted, filed, and appears in the record»
Count one refers primarily to NASD rules.

When those

have been abandoned, we are left to look —
QUESTION:

Well, what do you point to to suggest that

the government has dsandoned its claims under count, one?
MR. LOEVINGER:

Its concession that the NASD rules

are not under attack.
QUESTION:

Where is that?

MR. LOEVINGER:
QUESTION:

The —

Is that just in the record, or is it

in the brief —
MR. LOEVINGER:

Yes, it's — there is a letter from

counsel in-she Joint Appendix at page 327, it's set forth
in the Jurisdictional Statement, page 26.
the government brief at page 51.

It’s repeated in

And Mr. Norton made the

admission in oral argument here.
There is no attack upon NASD rules.

It’s perfectly

clear at this point.
QUESTION: But 'they do say that there are agreements
which had this effect of ousting any ~~ the development of
any secondary market?

52

MR. LOEVINGER;

Yes, sir? these are the agreements

that are attacking counts two through eight.
Now, actually, the existence of agreements is required
by Rule 26 of the NASD, which is of course not under attack.
And the restrictions on the sales fund -- on the fund sales
are, we maintain, plainly authorized by section 22(f).
So that, indeed, it does come down to the question of
what is this case all about, and let me quote from the
government brief, to suggest what the case may be about.
The government brief says, at page 9, that the
secondary dealer market doss not ordinarily produce any monetary
advantage to a buying investor.
Furthermore, this leads to the conclusion, in the
government brief at page 34, that "the prices in a competitive
secondary market are not likely to differ substantially from
the price established in the primary distribution chain/'
Consequently, one is really entitled to ask; Why
has the government brought, and why does it pursue this case?
And we believe that it is because it is dissatisfied
with its efforts to get ‘the SEC to act immediately to exempt
or abolish section 22(d) and to get Congress to repeal 22(d),
There were three exhaustive studies presented to
Congress, in 19S2, *63, and T66 on the securities markets.
There was four years of hearing, from 1967 through 1970? the
Department of Justice contended that 22(d) should be repealed.

53
The SEC saids

No, don’t repeal 22(d) but impose a flat

statutory maximum of 5 percent on sales loads.
Congress rejected both proposals, and in a legislative
with a legislative history that is perfectly clear, that
they were talking about the protection of the primary distribu­
tion system against any secondary trading markets. They reenacted section 22(d) in full in 1970, with the full knowledge
that since 1940 to 1970, the action of 22(d) and the Investment
Company Act had in fact eliminated the secondary market.
This was fully explained, it was fully explored,
there are numerous statements by Senators, Representatives,
and witnesses before the Congress, during the period 1967 to
1970.

So that we must look to the 1970 amendment of section

22(d) to see that Congress was fully aware that in enacting
section 22(d) and the other provisions of the Investment Company
Act, which were fully re-examined, it knew it was eliminating
the secondary trading markets.
Furthermore, I think that if the Court will look at
all the provisions of this extremely complicated and complex
statute, coupled with the provisions of the Maloney Act, it
will see „that regardless of the technical construction that
may be put on the specific terms of particular sections, that
there can be no real quarrel with v/hat the SEC states is the
basis of its interest in this case, in his brief at 19,
where it says the Investment Company Act of 1940 vests in the

54
Commission pervasive authority to regulate the process of
distributing mutual fund shares in the role of retail price
maintenance thereine
Furthermore, I call the Court's attention to the fact
that the government has sought to file its brief in Gordon in
this case as further elucidation of part of its position, and
in the government's brief as amicus in Gordon, it says at
page 35, it attempts to distinguish this case from the case of
the Exchange, and it says in the Maloney Act Congress expressly
incorporated antitrust principles and made it the duty of the
SEC to enforce them as applied to associations of over-thecounter dealers, thus trying to strengthen its position in
Gordon by pointing to the fact that here in fact there was an
antitrust duty resting on the SEC,
Mow, we submit that under the prevailing precedents
of this Court, this complaint must be dismissed, and I think
this is perfectly clear from the Pan American case and the
Hughes Tool case.
,-su -■&-*

ws-o

In Pan American, the Court said the acts charged as
antitrust violations are precise ingredients of the Court's
authority, if the parts were to include independently with
their construction the antitrust, laws, the two regimes might
collide.

Dismissal of antitrust suits for an administrative

remedy superseded the judicial one is the;usual- course.
In those cases, however, the CAB, which was the

administrative agency that was involved, filed briefs on the
side of the defendants and said it neither the competence nor
the authority to control the acts alleged as antitrust violations.
Here, in contrast, the SF.C is coming in and saying
it has both the competence and the authority to control these
matters.
Now, let me speak for just a minute about the
diagram which is said to elucidate the government"s position.,
In the first place, it omits and distorts -the
time dimensione The vertical transactions are all virtually
simultaneous transactions, whereas the horizontal and
diagonal transactions take place at different times, and so
are not comparable.
One firm cannot, contrary to Mr. Norton's assertion,
be a contract dealer and a non-contract dealer at the same
time with respect to the same fund.

Though one firm may be

a contract dealer as to one fund and a non*»contract dealer as
to another fund; but that's irrelevant.

You can't be both a

contract dealer and a non-contract dealer.
Second, since there is not and never has been a
brokerage market, the drawing of this tiling called broke, over
hare is simply lines on a paper that doesn’t correspond to
any reality# for the same reason the transaction labeled Y is
simply imaginary, because there isn't any such thing.

56
In the third place,, the transaction marked by the
sumhol X is not a secondary trading market transaction, it is
clearly part of the primary distribution system.

As part of

the primary distribution system, the X transaction is subject
to regulation by both the NASD and the SEC," both under section
22(f) and Rule 26 of the NASD.
The government brief indeed admits, at page 53, that
section 22(d) permits the NASD and the Commission to regulate
price and sales loads in connection with a primary distribution
market.
And the SEC is addressing itself to the interdealer
market.
Furthermore, transaction X is forbidden by Rule 26
of the NASD, which in effect provides that only contract
dealers are entitled to discounts, and that they shall purchase
only in order to fill investors’ orders.

Consequently, there

is simply no economic incentive and no functional purpose
served by transaction X.
Now, since transaction Y is imaginary and non­
existent, and since transaction X is prohibited by rules which
are not now attacked by the go\Ternment, there is simply no
transaction shown on this diagram which is restrained by any
conduct of the defendants which is under attack in this lawsuit,
QUESTIONS Well, you don't suggest that 22(d) or any
other law makes it illegal for a broker to match ~ to help an

investor sell his shares to another one?
He doesn’t violate the law, does he?
MR. LOEVINGER:

This is disputable, Mr. Justice.

As a matter of fact there is an argument made in —
QUESTION: Well, there's —
MR. LOEVINGER:

— the NASD brief to the effect

that the term "dealer" is used in a generic sense.
QUESTION:

Well, I’ll put it to you this v/ay.

The Securities and Exchange Commission doesn't think that
it’s illegal for a broker to do this, does it?
MR. LOEVINGER:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

The —

In fact they have a contrary opinion.

MR. LOEVINGER;

If they have taken — they have

never made any ruling that a contract dealer

can act as a

They have simply said that a securities firm, acting

only in the capacity of a broker, may match investors, and
sell orders.
QUESTION: That’s right.

So it’s not illegal, in

their opinion, for a broker to do that,
MR. LOEVINGER: But there is nothing charged in this
suit that would prevent that.

Because these are people who

by definition are not subject to the restrictions of the
sales agreements, and they are not subject to any inhibition
in the NASD rules.
QUESTION.

There’s just ~So you might have some problem if the

58
complaint was alleged to charge that there was some interfer­
ence with —
MR. LOEVINGER;

If there were a different complaint,

we might have a different complaint, Mr. Justice; but there is
nothing in this complaint nor, may I point out also, that the
government has filed an affidavit
75 pages of the printed record,

and 30 exhibits, taking

from pages 230 to 305,

elucidating the charges in this complaint.

There is no

suggestion anywhere that anything that has been done in fact
does suppress the independent brokerage market,
QUESTIONs Well, I take it — well, didn't the
district court rule that section 22(d)

or 22(d)

and 22(f)

together preempts or ousts the antitrust laws in this entire
case?
MR, LOEVINGER:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION; And that even if there was something aimed
at brokers matching investors, the antitrust laws would still
be irrelevant,
MR, LOEVINGER: As a matter of fact, we would take
that position, because we think that under the decisions of
this Court there is such a pervasive regulation of all these
transactions by the SEC that under TWA and Pan American the
Court would hold that the SEC has the authority and therefore
these are not subject to the antitrust laws.
We think that in that respect the Court's decision

59
is right.

Cut whether or not there may or may not be son®

QUESTIONS But if somebody is interfering with brokers
where they shouldn't be, it's up to the SEC not the antitrust
laws, you're suggesting, to remedy the matter?
MR„ LOEVINGER!

Yes, sir»

As a matter of fact, the

SEC is in fact acting and studying those very matters.

There

isn’t any question about it.
As a matter of fact, I think that in so far as this
chart has any relevance to the present case, what it shows is;
first, that the theoretical model of how the market operates,
which is in the miseris of the Department of Justice, government
attorneys, simply doesn’t correspond to reality? and second,
that there simply is no place where the authority of the SEC
and the jurisdiction and the application of the Investment
Company Act and the Maloney Act don’t apply,
In other words, that there is precisely that kind
of pervasive authority which the Court has said, in both TWA
and Pan Am, makes these things subject to administrative and
not to antitrust regulations.

And this is not a case where,

as in Pan Am, there was potential conflict between the
administrative and the judicial regimes.
This is a CSLS e in —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
Loevinger.

Your time is up now, Mr.

60

MR. LOEVINGER:

Yes, sir, Ifm taking just a few

minutes of Mr, North’s time, with his permission»
This is a case in which there is actual collision,
because the regulations that have been proposed by the SEC
staff are completely incompatible with the remedy that is sought
here by the Department of Justice»
As a matter of fact, the SEC staff seeks to establish
a possibility for the existence, presumably under modern
technology, of this alleged brokerage market»

In which case,

they say, -that transaction Y, which is a brokerage transaction,
could be subjected to a special charge to be payable to the
underwriter in order to help support the distribution system»
Nov?, as I say, this is not .a case of potential
conflict, this is a case of actual conflict between the
regulatory and the antitrust regimes,,

This Court has no

choice, under its precedents, but to dismiss the complaint.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER P. NORTH, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF S.E.C. AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. NORTH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The SEC is very thankful for this opportunity to

SI
participate in this argument.

It isn't often that we and the

Department of Justice disagree, and having done so in this
instance and we not being parties to the case and they are,
our only opportunity to be heard here is on an amicus basis,
and we appreciate your allowing us to do so.
Having listened to nearly an hour and a half of
argument by the appellant and the appellees, I see no need
at this stage to try to recap the whole case.
I'm going to confine myself instead to making two
or three specific points which I think are significant and
emphasize and enlarge upon a little the way it was put by
the other counsel.
I think the beginning of this case is to take a
good hard look at the nature of the open-end mutual fund
business.
Now, between the government counsel and counsel for
the litigants, private litigants, you’ve had a rather full
exposition of the way the market operates and quite a lot
said about the legislative history.

Hut I think the starting

point is perhaps even back of that.
The mutual fund shares are not marketed in the way
that General Motors stock is.
place at auction.

You don't buy it on the market­

The mutual fund makes a continuous offering

of its shares, which it has to do in order to meet the
redemptions which the lav/ requires it to meet.

62
In order to make continuous sales of mutual fund
shares, there has to be a primary distribution system that
will hopefully keep up their new sales parallel with if not
in excess of their redemptions»
If you don't have that result, the fund is going to
be forced into a gradual liquidation and eventually will have
to go out of business»
I think that when you bear that in mind, it puts the
importance of the primary distribution system that Congress
has seen fit to try to protect in a much stronger light than
you might otherwise consider it, and I think it's very important
that wa do take that into account.
Now, I'd like next to touch upon one aspect of the
government's argument, which I think is highly technical and
exults form over substance.
They say that the contracts that exist between the
fund and the underwriter and, in turn, between the underwriter
ad the contract dealers are not sustainable under section 22(f)
as being restrictions on transfer.ability.

They say apparently

that you have to have something that's written on the face of
the stock certificate or is expressed in some other way, but
as long- as these contracts are filed with the SEC, as -they
are and always have been since the 1940 Act was adopted

,

and

as long as they are incorporated into the registration state»
msnt, I can see no basis for saying that they don't fully

63
comply with section 22(f)»
QUESTION: Even if the SEC doesn't even look at it?
MR. tlORTHs
QUESTION;
MR- NORTH:

Doesn't look at them, you say?
Yes.
Mr. Justice, I don't think that makes

any difference one way or another.
QUESTION: Well, when did you start regulating on
22(f)?

When did the SEC start regulating?
MR. NORTH;

Well, it started, I would say, in 1941

when we first reviewed the NASD's initial rules that were
adopted pursuant to this section of the statute.
QUESTION;
MR. NORTH:

You issued regulations?
We have not adopted any specific rule

under 22(f) —
QUESTION;

Until today, "have you?

MR, NORTH:

Well, I'm not even doing it today.

As a matter of fact, we have exercised ~
QUESTION:
question:

Well, you're telling me to ask another

Do you ever expect to?
MR, NORTH:

We have proposals right now that we're

working on to go to Congress with, to change some of these
things by statute rather than just by regulation of our own.
And we in the meantime have specifically requested the NASD,
just last November, to adopt a rule which would loosen up, to
some extent, the right of others to participate in the market

64

of mutual fund shares as distinguished f.rom limiting it to the
primary distribution that they now have»
But the Commission has exercised tacit surveillance
in this whole area, all throughout the history of the Investmen
Company Act»
The only thing it hasn't done is to adopt a specific
rule under 22(f), because it has never found occasion to take
exception to the NASD's rules in this area, which it has
carefully reviewed and kept track of.

And commented upon

from time to time.
Indeed, the Joint Appendix contains here some
conferences between representatives of the Commission and the
NASD which show that there was mutual consultation on the
limits of these things, and on what should be dona in these
areas.

So it seams to me that the important thing here is

that the NASD and its members have consistently, since both
before and after the 1940 Act, conducted a primary distribution
system that was based upon contracts which contain these
provisions, these contracts are on file with the Commission
as a part of the registration statement, which is just what
22(f) says there should be.
QUESTION:

Well, let me ask you this:

You're

suggesting that the SEC, by not disapproving any of these
agreements, has in effect approved a contract between

for

example, between a contract dealer and an underwriter that the

dealer will never acfc as a broker between two investors?
MR. NORTH?

The Commission has approved the portion

of that contract which ■»QUESTIONs

No, let me just -*

MR. NORTH?

—* which you’re mentioning.

QUESTION s

Then your answer is yes?

MR. NORTH s
QUESTION;

Yes .
And that there are such agreements in

existence where the people participating in the primary
distribution system agree that they won't broker it?
MR. NORTH;

That’s right.

QUESTION: And the underwriter agrees with the mutual
fund that his contract dealers won’t broker.
MR. NORTH; That’s right.
QUESTION;

And you say that you’ve approved those

agreements and therefore they're exempt from the antitrust
laws?
MR, NORTH;

I’m saying,. Your Honor, that we haven't

— we haven’t disapproved them.
QUESTION;

22(f) permits ■—

Nell then, a fortiori, if you’d

approved them, you would say they would be exempt?
MR. NORTH;
QUESTION;
the Act?

Yes, certainly.
Now, what’s essential to the operation of

Where do you find in the Act any authorization for

approving or for exempting that kind of a contract from the

J

66

antitrust laws?
Put your finger right on it in that Act# in section
22(d) or (f) .
MR. NORTHs

22(d) — 22(f) reads "Ho registered

open-end company shall restrict the transferability .„« of
any security of which it is the issuer except in conformity
with the statements with respect thereto contained in its
registration statement"# which statements are not in contra­
vention of any rule of the Commission.
QUESTION: He11# yes# you're just saying that under
(f) the -- any kind of agreement known to man# as long as you
/sic/

don't approve it# is perfectly all right.
MR. NORTHt

We're saying that restrictions on

transferability of the shares of an issuer are unobjectionable
from the standpoint of the antitrust laws if# as long as
they are contained in the —
QUESTIONs Are you suggesting that it could say —
that the stock could have on it# and have enforcible# that
one investor couldn't sell to another?
MR. NORTH:

No.

QUESTION: Well# why wouldn't you?

As long as you

didn't disapprove it,
QUESTION;

If it's in the registration statement and

if it's not disapproved by the SEC# I think your answer would
be yes under 22(f).

67

MR. NORTH?

Maybe I didn't understand the question,

I’m sorry,
QUESTION? Well# you would say that such a restric­
tion on a sale from one investor to another would be not only
— certainly there wouldn* t be anything wrong with that, as
long as you didn't disapprove it?
QUESTION? And as long as it was in -the .registration
papers.
QUESTION:
MR. NORTH;

Yes,
Til at1 s undoubtedly so.

But I'm not at

all sure but what we wouldn't disapprove it if they went that
far.
In other words, I think that Congress has vested
the authority in the Commission to do that.
QUESTION; All right.

You're suggesting then that

the SEC would interpret the Act to exclude that kind of a
restriction?
MR. NORTH;

I think we would say

QUESTION; So there are restrictions which the
Act wouldn’t permit you to approve?
MR. NORTH;

The Act permits us to approve only ones

that we feel are in the best interest of the shareholders and
the investing public.
QUESTION? That's all I want to know.
MR. NORTH?

v

And that's exactly where we think the

68

authority in this area lies, as against lying in the hands of
an antitrust court, which wants to do the ruling for the
Commission in this area»
QUESTION:
QUESTIONS
MR, NORTH s
QUESTIONs

Very wall.
Mr. North.
Yes, Your Honor?
In the Commission's letter of November 22nd

to the NASD, you framed a request that certain changes be
accomplished.
Let's assume for the moment that the NASD said,
No, we don't agree with the Commission, we're not going to
make those changes.

In your opinion, does the Commission have

authority, under 22(f) or any other section of the Act, to
require compliance?
MR. NORTIIs

I think the Commission has adequate

authority to require compliance.

We're sending that letter

to the NASD to give -them the first opportunity to move in
this area, if they see fit to do so.

And I'm not at all sure

but what the Commission, if the NASD did not see fit to do so,
wouldn't either compel them to do it or enact a rule of its
own to t!iat same effect.
QUESTION:
MR. NORTH:

And you'd enact such a rule under 22(f)?
Under that or under 6(c) or under 38,

there are several sections of the Act that give the Commission
rule-making authority that I think would cover this kind of a

69

situation.
There are sometimes situations that ws don't think
our rule-making authority covers.

We’re working right now

on a draft of soma legislation we*re going to submit to
Congress to give us powers in some of these respects.

And

someone asked the question earlier in the argument as to
whether or not we had any reaction from Congress as a result
of the report that was submitted last November, some 130-40
pages long.
The answer is that the committees of the Congress
are still x^aiting for us to send over a draft or actual bills
that do incorporate or implement some of these suggestions
that are made in this report.
So the Commission is actively studying this whole
situation, has soma ideas of its own to indicate that maybe
this system, as it is now, isn’t perfect and maybe it needs
some changes? maybe it needs some relaxing.
But they want to go about it in a cautious, judicious
manner and not just chop it off by an antitrust court decree
that says the whole primary distribution system no longer needs
any protection.

Uhich is, I think, virtually where you might

end up if you had an antitrust court decision in favor of the
government in this case.
Incidentally, I would like — I see my time is
nearly up — I would like to close by referring to a paragraph

70

from this Commission report that we sent over to Congress just
last November»
On the very last page of the government's, the
Department of Justice, reply brief, they quote what they say
is a sentence out of this report.
Incidentally, this report is a report by the staff
to the Commission, it isn't the Commission's own report at all»
They say the Commission has made this observation, and they
say we made this observation in a related context.
Her® is what they say we said to the Congress in that
report, and as far as it goes

I don't say it's inaccurate;

it's word for word the way our report reads.
It says that "an exaggerated fear of disorderly
distribution should not be permitted to form a pretext for .
avoiding the intero duc tion of price competition which, while
perhaps difficult and even unprofitable for particular funds
and their underwriters, and certain dealers, would be to the
benefit of investors and the mutual fund industry generally."
How, the thing that 'the government’s brief does not
do is include the first word of that sentence, which was
"however"; it's a "However" sentence.

And a "however"

sentence, by its very nature, assumes that you're distinguishing
something that just went before.
Here is the sentence before the "however" sentence,
which they quote without the "however";

71
"There is of course a necessity to avoid disruption
of the fund distribution systems® and then it goes on, "how­
ever" and then they say this.
QUESTION;

Mr, North, if that’s a staff report,

what action has the Commission taken upon that report as of
now?
MR. NORTH;

They have transmitted it to the Congress,

they are working now on a draft of sons legislation to
implement parts of it, we have —
QUESTION;

Did the Commission send any report of

its own to Congress?
MR. NORTH; There is an extensive letter of trans­
mittal, signed by the Chairman of the Commission, and
authorised by the whole Commission, some eight pages in length,
single-spaced, stating the Commission's own reaction, and
sustaining some of the recommendations of the staff.
QUESTION; So it took the Commission 35 years to get
to the point of getting to this bill? right?
MR. NORTH;

Well, no, there have been proposals

up in a number of other Congresses.
QUESTION;

There were proposals —

Not initiated by the Comroission?

initiated by Congress,'— by the Department of Justice?
>

MR, NORTH;

1

Oh, no. The Commission in 1967 and

against in 1969 had proposals before the Congress, including
some modifications of this section 22, the vary section we’ra

72
talking about»
QUESTIONS

Granting all of that# but am I still

— I still want an answers

Has the Commission done anything

in the realm of regulation on 22?
MR. NORTHs

22(f)

not# no# they’ve never adopted

a formal rule*
I would suggest one other thing# then I'll be through
that this quotation that I just read is in a portion of the
Commission's report which is recommending legislative
proposals.

And yet they say we made that statement in a

related context,
I would say this is just the opposite context.
The context of what you think the law is in a lawsuit is one
thing? the context of what you want when you go to Congress
to get the change in the law is quite a different tiling,
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

four minutes; you may have four minutes for rebuttal,
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GERALD P. NORTON# ESQ.#
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. NORTON:

I appreciate that,

I'd like to address one comment by Mr, Loevinger.
He said that these contracts had been in existence before and
after the Investment Company Act; that the only thing that

73
happened was the enactment of that Act»
Well, it is true -that -tine Investment Company Study
shows that there were such contractual restrictions prior to
1940.

It did not indicate that they had become widespread in

virtually the norm, the way they are now.

This is indeed

part of count one.
Count one says that they have combined to restrain
the development of secondary markets,* and one of the ways in
which -they have done it is to induce the funds and underwriters
to include these restrictive provisions in their vertical
agreements.
So that we don't have a record, first of all, on
what existed prior to 1940, but it is inaccurate to suggest
that there is nothing since then that is important.
We certainly do not withdraw -- we have not with­
drawn or abandoned count one in any way.

What we have done is

clarified one single allegation of count one

which could have

been viewed as challenging rules adopted by the NASD»
We've made it clear that that is not part of count one.
The balance of count one, which is at page 9 of the
Appendix, stands fully in effect,
Nov;, with respect to 22(f), the Commission has
considered that they have done nothing under 22(f), as we
have indicated, but they also indicated that they thought that
they could act with reference to not only protection of

74
outstanding shareholders# but protection
QUESTIONs

Well# does the rules of NASD purport

to recommend or authorise or forbid a dealer to act as a
broker?
MR. NORTON:
QUESTION:

NASD rules?

No.

Well# but I take it then# that part of

your cause of action is that dealers do agree not to act as
brokers —
MR. NORTON:
QUESTION:
MR. NORTON:

That’s right.
and you attack that idea.
That’s right.

And the complaint is not limited to brokerage
markets involving contract dealers.
QUESTION:
MR. NORTON:

Count one is unqualified.

I understand.
Now# 22(f) does not# as Mr. North

indicated# refer in terms to the protection of the investing
public who are not already shareholders.
Now# another provision that should be borne in mind
in considering 22(f)

is section 50 of the Act, which provides

that notiiing in the Act affects the jurisdiction of any agency
or officer of the United States or any State with respect to
any purchase# security or transaction# except in the possible
ay*ent of any conflict with something in the Act.
Now# there is no conflict with anything in the
antitrust law and 22(f) standing alone.

75
So we have the statute supporting us in that
regard,
I should suppose also that the mere fact that a
registration statement discloses a merger# for example#
that would tend to violate the antitrust laws# would not
mean that that merger is immune.

That is contrary to the

facts of life and the way this Court has applied the antitrust
laws in words»,
Similarly# if the restriction on transferability
precluded the sale to a black person? that would be a violation
of the federal Civil Rights laws„

It may be unlikely# but

with current activities in the investment world# various
tilings may seem more likely than we would like.

Probably

not be exempted in the Civil Rights Act# just because it was
disclosed in the registration statement.
The Commission’s requirements that prospectuses
of the shareholders indicate that the fact that the document
has been reviewed by the Commission does not constitute
approval of it, it is not any guarantee of the adequacy or
the accuracy of any representations therein.
As an example of that, in government Exhibit 8# on
page 254# the standard legend which denies any notion that
the Commission action in reviewing these statements is an
approval.
Thank you.
