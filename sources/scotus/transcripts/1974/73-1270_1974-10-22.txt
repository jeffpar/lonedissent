MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 73-1270,, Kelley against Southern Pacific.
Mr. Engel, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. J. ENGEL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
i

MR. ENGEL:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Courts
Ostensibly the issue that is appearing before Your
Honors is whether this Court should set new guidelines for
determining employee status under the PELA, or the Federal
Employers Liability Act.
Southern Pacific Company was successful in maintaining
in the Ninth Circuit that the District Court had applied a new
legal theory in creating employee status under the FELA»
This new legal theory purportedly comes from the
Fourth Circuit in a case called Smith_ys« Norfolk»
Petitioner not only disagrees with Southern Pacific's
contention as to what the theory, or legal theory is that is
set forth in Smith, but, further, petitioner believes that
there is a threshold issue here that has not been briefed nor
argued, either by the Ninth Circuit or by Southern Pacific
Company„
Contrary to Southern Pacific Company's analysis,
both the trial court, the District Court, and both parties

4
recognise that a factual question was being submitted and
that the Court was going to render a factual conclusion as
opposed to a legal conclusion.
Because the Ninth Circuit did not consider this
issue and did not consider whether or not the trial court or
District Court was in fact rendering a factual conclusion,,
the Ninth Circuit simply ignored the issues with regard to
the liraitations on its appellate review power in an
appellate court or a circuit court reviewing a factual
determination by the District Court,
I suggest that what's at the heart of this matter
is that the Ninth Circuit desires to have this Court
postulate a new theory, a new theory with regard to it
determining employee status»

And to accomplish this, what

the Ninth Circuit did is it selected a single fact or finding
by the District Court and it singled out a single authority
that was relied on by the trial court or the Ninth Circuit,
and it ignored all the other findings and it ignored all the
other authorities that were relied on by the District Court»
Now, tire reason I suggest that this Court is before
or that this case is before this Court is that the Ninth
Circuit failed to recognize the factual consideration
rendered by the District Court, and that the Ninth Circuit's
appropriate appellate review power was to deal with it as a
factual conclusion and uphold the District Court's decision»

5
The Tenth Circuit, in a very similar type of case,.
Missouri-'Kansas vs. Hears on, harmonized and set forth both the
Smith decision and the Ninth Circuit decisions as authority
for a single proposition.

The Tenth Circuit had no problem at

all recognising that Smith vs, Norfolk did not set forth a new
legal theory,
And X suggest to this Court that the analysis that th
Tenth Circuit made in the Hissouri-Kansas vs» Hearson decision
is a correct analysis of the Smith decision and is the same
analysis that the District Court made in the case at bar.
The result of the Ninth Circuit decision in this
matter is that it is the- only appellate decision which has
overturned a District Court’s factual conclusion as to what
constitutes an employee under the FELA,

There are decisions

both ways in the District Courts, where District Courts have
rendered conclusions that a person was not an employee and
there are decisions where the District Court has concluded
that a person employed by an independent contractor was 'an
employee.
And the Ninth Circuit review is the only decision
where those type of preliminary factual conclusions were made
by a. District Court, has been overturned,
QUESTION;
MR, ENGEL:
QUESTION:

Mr, Engel, —
Yes?
~~ I'm puzzled by the sentence at the

6
bottom of page 11 of your Petition
MR. ENGELs
QUESTION;

page 11„

Yes.
You state that ‘’the Court of Appeals/

by ruling directly to the contrary/ without supporting
authority, intentionally created a conflict in Court of
Appeals decisions e"
Are you suggesting that CA-9 did not decide this
case in good faith, in the exercise of its judicial discretion,
merely for the purpose of creating a conflict?
MR. ENGEL;

No, Your Honor, that would not be my

intent in making that decision.

I recognise that -shat is a

reither strong statement and certainly could be interpreted in
the manner that Your Honor is suggesting.
I think the Court was trying, in all good faith, to
render a very appropriate decision, but I think that what the
Court did cone up with was an obvious conflict in the circuits,
when, in fact, the issue that was presented to the Ninth
Circuit was whether a factual determination had been made by
the District Court.
Bo that when I say they intentionally made a conflict,
what I'm suggesting is that they were aware that they were
creating a conflict and that that did not cause them —
it did not cause them to follow the Fourth Circuit is what it
amounted to.
QUESTION;

They explicitly disagreed with -the

7
Fourth Circuit then?
MR, ENGEL:

Yes,

QUESTION:

That's what you mean, not consciously

and. deliberately,
MR. ENGEL:

Well-, actually what I’m saying is that

they misinterpreted the Fourth Circuit»
QUESTION:
MR. ENGEL:
conflict.

Unh-hunh.
They thought they were creating a

The Fourth Circuit decision in Smith vs. Norfolk» as

the Tenth Circuit has recognized, is not a new legal theory.
It is consistent with all the other circuits.
QUESTION:

Your theory is that the question in each

case is a factual questions
the railroad?

Is the plaintiff an employee of

And that

MR. ENGEL:

Yes,

And all the Circuits agree with

that o
QUESTION:

-- it’s not a ~~ and that there’s not a

conflict in law.
HR. ENGEL;

No, Your Honor. And I think that the

reasoning that the Tenth Circuit made in that regard, in citing
the cases in the Ninth Circuit as v?eil as the Fourth Circuit,
harmonizes all the Circuits into one consistent viewpoint,
and that is that we have a factual determination to Be made by
the trial court along the guidelines of the Restatement, Section
220, and that the District Court in this matter, that is

8

precisely what it attempted to do.
QUESTION:

Well, if that's the case, is this an

appropriate case for us to grant plenary review in, if there
really isn’t the kind of conflict that I got the impression
there was from your petition?
MR. ENGEL: Well, the Ninth Circuit decision, as it
stands now, creates a conflict, because they misinterpreted
or misread, in my judgment, the Fourth Circuit opinion.
In other words, they have placed a legal interpretation on the Fourth Circuit's opinion, and they are saying
in the Ninth Circuit that we are ruling to the contrary.
So there is a conflict.
But I’m suggesting that when you go under the
surface of it and examine the Fourth Circuit decision, it is
not in conflict with any of the other circuits, and the
only decision now that is in conflict with the other circuits
is the Ninth Circuit decision in the case at bar.

Because

it is the only appellate decision that has overturned a
District Court's factual conclusion on employee status.
QUESTION:

Mr. Engel, I taka it you are supporting,

then, tlie findings and conclusions that Judge Zirpoli made?
MR. ENGEL:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
And what about this language in his

conclusions that "The work being performed by Mr. Kelley
involved a nondelegable duty of the Southern Pacific"?

Are

9

you supporting that also?
MR. ENGEL:

Yes, Your Honor., That finding, what it

provides, or how I read it, is that the Court was concluding
that it was the nature of the work that the: plaintiff war,
performing that brought him within the coverage of the PELA,
that the plaintiff was doing a nondelegable duty, or was
performing work in the services of the railroad, which is the
definition that the Restatement uses for determining what
who an employee belongs to at the time of a particular act.
And the trial court here, the District Court, was
concluding that, the plaintiff was fulfilling work of Southern
Pacific Company, and it was because of that that the plaintiff
was entitled to the coverage of the Federal Employers
Liability Act.
QUESTION:

You don't think that that is the pivot

of the Ninth Circuit’s disagreement and disaffection with the
District Court’s —
MR. ENGEL;
QUESTION:
MR. ENGEL:

What the Ninth Circuit
Perhaps you drew these, did you?
No, Your Honor.

I drew -- I proposed

some, the Court changed a number of them.

Most of mine were

broken down more singularly, and it combined its findings
and made it a shorter set of findings.
What the Ninth Circuit did, it did not comment on
that finding, Your Honor.

The Ninth Circuit picked out the

10

fourth conclusion of fact, or finding of fact by the District
Court, where the Court concluded that Pacific Motor Trucking
Company was an agent of Southern Pacific Company,, But the
Ninth Circuit ignored the finding No. 9, which concluded, as
a factual basis, that the type of work that the plaintiff
was doing brought him within the PELA *
In other words, the Ninth Circuit concluded and
said:

The District Court found

that Pacific Motor Trucking

Company was an agent of Southern Pacific Company and therefore
there was FELA coverage*
That is not what the findings show*

The finding

with regard to the agency for the trucking company is in No* 4,
but the finding that the Court used to support the FELA
coverage is No. 9, where it says the plaintiff was fulfilling
a nondelegable duty of -die defendant Southern Pacific Company,
which brought the plaintiff within the traditional agency
relationship, and in such a relationship to the defendant
Southern Pacific Company*
QUESTIONS Well, the Ninth Circuit certainly referred
to the nondelegable language,
MR. ENGEL:
QUESTION!
MR, ENGEL:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Mr. Engel, —
Yes?
— x have not checked these other cases

you mentioned, do you happen to recall haw many of them

II
involve jury verdicts# with respect to the status of the
employee?
Here you had no jury# you had a District Judge who
made certain findings# some of which perhaps are arguably at
least mixed findings of lav; and fact*
But my question is# in the cases on which you rely,
were they jury verdicts or decisions by District Judges?
MR* ENGEL:
Honor*

Well# they are a combination# Your

Some of them are motions for summary judgment that

went up on appeal# which of course were decided by a court
or a judge# and some of them are jury conclusions at the time
of trial*
I don't know another case dealing either with FELL
law or I couldn't find another case# period# where you had a
situation where the parties agreed to waive a jury as to the
limited issue# and submitted that factual question to the court
for determination# as we did here.
We were then going to proceed with the questions of
negligence and damages to a jury*

But. it was well understood

at the time of trial that this limited issue was# we were
waiving a jury as to that one limited factual question and
that factual question was going to be decided by the court*
QUESTION:

May I ask, while I've interrupted you#

whether it is permissible under California law, or under the
Federal Act# for an injured employee to receive both Workmen's

12

Compensation benefits and FELA benefits?
MR. ENGEL:

Yes, Your Honor*, there are —- in fact*,

I should have cited it to the Court» There is a decision where
that issue was raised in an FELA situation, and, while X’ra
not that confident about the court nor the ruling, ray
recollection was that the court concluded

I think it was a

Circuit Court -- that because somebody had applied for
Workmen's Compensation benefits -that that was not a factor in
determining whether or not he was entitled to FELA coverage»
QUESTION: Would he be entitled to retain both
benefits?
MR, ENGEL:

Well, while this is not within the

purview of this appeal, I would anticipate that in the event
this Court rules in favor of petitioner, that what will
happen is Southern Pacific will then stop the Workmen's
Compensation benefits, and we will litigate that isstr• 9 as t;
whether or not that's appropriate or not.
QUESTION:

I thought the workmen’s Compensation

caras from Pacific.
MR, ENGEL:

Well, —

QUESTION: Granted it's a "wholly owned sub, but it's MR. ENGEL:

I’m sorry, I use them interchangeably,.

It is —- I'm suggesting that Pacific Motor Trucking Company
will stop the Workmen’s Compensation benefits, and we will
then litigate that issue.

13

QUESTION: But there’s no right to subrogation.
MR* ENGEL:

Thera is not in this case, no. Your Honor.

QUESTION: But would there be a right of

what

of credit to any# against any coverage
MR* ENGEL:
Your Honor.

Well# I think it’s going to be complex#

Because that is a State right# under State

statute# and the rights under -the FELA are not. State-oriented
but federal“oriented.
QUESTION:

Well# I’m merely asking whether there

would be a double recovery here# and I take it this is what
Justice Powell is concerned about.
MR, ENGEL:

Well# Your Honor# of course I’d like to

say to you# because I know double recoveries are not something
■that are desired by any court# that no# they won’t happen,
But# to be perfectly candid with Your Honor# I anticipate that
when Pacific Motor Trucking Company stops the payments# that
I will go to the law books and see what I can do for Mr,
Kelley to see if he’s not entitled to both.
But I can’t tell Your Honor what I would anticipate
the result of that would be.
QUESTION:

Do you ■— would you agree that the District

Court was# in its mixed finding about the nondelegable duty#
holding that a railroad cannot# under any circumstances# engage
an independent contractor totally unrelated to it# uhtLike
Pacific# totally unrelated and thereby avoid FELA responsible-

14

ities?

Is that the impact of his holding?
MR. ENGEL?,

Well, 'the impact that I find in that

finding is that he was characterising the work that was being
done by Mr. Kelley as being '’performing in the services of
the railroad".
I don't think -that his finding goes so far as to
say that any time an individual is performing a certain type
of work that they are necessarily an "employee" within the
PELA.
In other words, each case would still have to be
determined on the facts, and I don't think there is anything
in the Smith case nor in the District Court's decision here
where that you could anticipate that every time an individual,
who fell from a tri~level railroad car, would necessarily be
entitled to FELA coverage»

It would be determined factually

in that given case at that given time,
QUESTION:

Well, you say "every person".

Limit

that to "a person" who is unloading the car, ~MR. ENGEL s

Yes.

QUESTION:

— hasn't the District Judge said that

unloading is a function of the common carrier, the railroad,
and can't be passed on to anybody else?
MR. ENGEL:

No, I don’t think so, Your Honor.

I

think that in this particular case he found that to be true.
There are some particular facts in -this given case, which, in

15
my opinion, caused him to come to -that conclusion.

There was

difference of opinion in the briefs with regard, for example,
to whether this work was within the tariff of the railroad,,
The work of unloading the tri™level railroad car
doesn’t necessarily have to be within the tariff of the rail­
road.

It was in this particular case.
QUESTION:

I thought in the fact-finding it was,

MR» ENGEL:

Yes, oh, yes»

QUESTION:

Finding IV says it,

wasn't it?

MR. ENGEL:

in this case --

I’m saying in this case that is true,

but it doesn’t necessarily have to be, and the next person
who is working on a tri-level railroad car and falls off, in
that instance the railroad may not have within its tariff the
unloading of the automobiles.

That would be a significant

fact th: ’- would be different.
So that there are differences in fact in each case.
And I think what the District Did here is that in this
particular case he concluded, that Southern Pacific Company
in this particular case had a nondelegable duty.
QUESTION:
cite Sinkier.

I notice that the Court of Appeals didn’t

Does it have any relevance here?

MR. ENGEL:

Well, Sinkier was a case involving

determination of the defendant class as opposed to the plaintiff
class.

I think it has application in that both in Sinkier,

where they were determining the defendant class — in other
words, who are the employers that can be sued,,
QUESTION;

Wall, you had an independent employer

there, as you do here»
MR. ENGEL:

Yes.

QUESTION? There it was the belt railroad.
MR» ENGEL:

Yes.

QUESTION;

And it was performing what we character­

ise as an operational activity of the respondent railroad,
which was sued.
In light of Finding IV, why isn't that this situation
MR. ENGEL:

Well, because Sinkier dealt with

determining the defendant.

In other words, it was the

was ths defendant an employer who could be sued?
In our instance we're talking about:

Is the injured

party an employes that can sue an employer, an identified
employer?
But they are very similar in -chat both cases, both
the Baker and —QUESTION:

Oh, I sea. There we held

that's right.

There the award was to an employee of this plaintiff, of this
defendant railroad, by reason of the negligence of the belt
railroad.
MR, ENGEL:
QUESTION;

That's right.
I see

In -this instance what we have is

17
the negligence of his employer,
MR» ENGEL;

Correct.,

QUESTION; Right»

That is? it's directed --

MR. ENGEL;

We’re going back the other way.

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. ENGEL; But there is a similarity in that both
cases turn on what was the nature of the work that the party
involved was doing at the time.
QUESTION;

That determines

Well? whether it was part of the opera­

tional activities of the respondent railroad,
MR. ENGEL:

Yes.

QUESTION; And I would suppose that Finding IV here
doesn’t seem to have been challenged in the Court of Appeals,
saying that what was done here was in the regular course of its
business, that is of the Southern Pacific, pursuant to its
contractual responsibilities to the shippers and its tariff
res pons ib i 1 i ties,
MR, ENGEL;

Correct.

QUESTION; So that, in any event, the operation was
within the operational activities of the Southern Pacific.
MR. ENGEL:

It was so found.

QUESTION:

That seems to be what that finding

MR. ENGEL:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

In other words, having been paid for it,

for the unloading operation, Southern Pacific would not be

18

heard by the District Judge to say that it wasn’t part of
their employment?
MR. ENGEL;

That's correct. And there was some

dispute about it at the time of trial and in the briefs, as
to whether or not that tariff was -- actually covered the
unloading operation, and Your Honors will note that we have
attached a copy to our brief of the interrogatory, where we
had taken the deposition of one of the SP superiors, who said
that he thought it was an alternative tariff situation that
some shippers could and some shippers would not be charged
that tariff.

But, in fact, when an interrogatory was sub­

mitted to Southern Pacific Company, they specified that -that
employee Wtis inaccurate and that all railroad tri-.'level
automobile carriers at that time, the tariff included the
unloading operation.
QUESTION: What page is that on in your -- I take it
it's in the Appendix?
MR. ENGEL:

In the Appendix, yes, Your Honor.

That’s pages Roman numeral twelve through fifteen,
the question, it begins at twelve and the answer is on fifteen.
Roman numeral fifteen, at the end.
QUESTION:

Well now, unless I don't read my

Roman numerals correct, I haven’t got that many pages in your
Appendix, at least to your brief.
MR. ENGEL:

Oh, I’m sorry, Your Honor.

I'm speaking

QUESTION:
MR. ENGEL:
QUESTION:

Oh,
I don't believe it*s attached to idle
I do have it attached to the petition.
Yes,
In the absence of any further questions May I just ask, Mr, Engel, suppose this

employer had not been wholly owned by Southern Pacific?
MR, ENGEL:

I don't -think that would make any

difference,
QUESTION:

It wouldn't make any difference?

MR. ENGEL:

No,

QUESTION:

So it all has to turn on the fact that

this employer was performing an essential operational activity
of the railroad?
MR. ENGEL: Well, -this particular individual.

,

In other words, rather than the employer — in other words
just because Pacific Motor Tracking -QUESTION:
MR. ENGEL:

Right,
Right.

Right,

He was doing the unloading

He was doing a particular act

and that particular act, because of the nature of that act,
was actually performing the services of Southern Pacific
Company, and consequently he's entitled to FELL coverage,
QUESTION: So I take it, if there were an engine that
broke down, instead of one of the Southern Pacific's mechanics

20

repairing it/ Southern Pacific hired a plumbing company and a
plumber employed by that company came and repaired the boiler
of the locomotive and was injured in the process, you would
say he could recover against Southern Pacific?
MR a ENGEL:

I would say he could, but not necas sari

In other words, I don't think any of these cases turn on one
particular fact.
QUESTION:

Well, a fact-finding could have been

made —

that he was, for that purpose, an

23
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J, CORRIGAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. CORRIGANs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
As I perceive the issue in this case, it is s

Shall

the FELA lav; be extended to include persons other than
employees of railroads?
All of the cases cited by all of the parties, save
and except one, make a finding of employment by a railroad,
whether it’s through a borrowed servant doctrine, a joint
servant doctrine, an alter-ego doctrine, or some doctrine,
they all make a finding of employment.
Counsel says that the Tenth Circuit harmonizes the
Ninth' Circuit and the Fourth Circuit.

The Tenth Circuit case

he has in mind is nearson vs. the K-T Railroad.

It's cited

in the briefs, and it's 422 Fed 2nd,
The Court finds in Hearson that Hearson was an
employee of ■idle K-T.
In other words, the K-T

sold its car-cleaning

facilities to try to avoid the consequences of the act.
they kept control over Mr. Hearson,

But

And the Court says it

doesn't matter whether he sweeps from the right or the left,
the point is the railroad still maintained the necessary
control, and because they did that Mr. Hearson continued to be
an employee.

24
Now, he also relies, and he just cited a CircuitCourt case, Brvne vs, Pennsylvania. Railroad, there you had a
Westinghouse engineer whose job it was to service sophisticated
locomotives after they were sold to the company, the railroad
company,

And

he came on the railroad property and he worked

on these locomotives, and he came under the control of the
railroad,

And that case held he was a joint employee.

There

was a conventional common law employment relationship that
developed which was not developed in this case

I'd like to point out one thing •—>

Mr. Corrigan, are you saying that there

MR, CORRIGAN:
QUESTION:

Right.

I’d like to point out —

I thought -there were some aspects of

26
evidence that he was subject to direction of SP employees.
Is my impression incorrect?
MR. CORRIGANs

If we may, we'll go to the findings.

Counsel says this is a case where the appellate court sought
to change the findings, to re-evaluate them, to interpret them.
They didn’t.
The opinion of the Ninth Circuit begins and ends
with the findings of the District Court.
The District Court found that Mr« Kelley was an
employee? he was in the employment of the PMT.
QUESTION:

He was paid

Well? what about Finding VIII? Mr.

Corrigan?
MR. CORRIGAN:
QUESTION:

That finding is —

It’s on page 29.

"The responsibility for

immediate supervision"and so forth "was that of Southern
Pacific? even though the exercise thereof was executed by
employees of Pacific".
MR. CORRIGAN:

Yes? he was in the exercise of

control was that of the Pacific Motor Trucking Company
QUESTION:

Well? I’m sorry? as I read it at least?

it says "The responsibility for immediate supervision and
control of the unloading operations" was Southern Pacific's?
"even though the exercise thereof" — meaning of the supervision
and control — "was executed by employees of Pacific."
MR. CORRIGAN:

Yes? the responsibility? sir? but it

27
doesn't say the control was in the Southern Pacific, sir?
it dees not say the right of control was in the Southern
Pacific —
QUESTION:
don't understand.

Well, why doesn't it?

That's what I

That the responsibility was there, doesn't

that also mean the right was there?
MR. CORRIGAN:
QUESTION:

No.

Could I explain why?

I wish you would.

MR. CORRIGAN:

All right, sir.

The railroads in the Twentieth Century have become
a very sophisticated operation.

We have, for example,

computers that help run the transportation system. We have
sophisticated telephone systems.

We don't have the where»

withal or the knowledge to run these computers, but we have
the responsibility to see that they run so the railroad can
continue running.
Does that make all the IBM employees who come in
and fix those computers railroad employees for the purposes
of the PELA?

Does that make all the telephone company

employees employees for the purpose of the PELA?
These are employees of another company.

And counsel

acknowledged, that it wouldn't make any difference whether
we're talking about a subsidiary company or some other company.
There ara many things in a railroad enterprise that
have to be done by others.

that the District Judge carefully avoided, in so many words,

Pacific.
MR. CORRIGAN:

The best thing in this case is the

finding of the District Judge for the Southern Pacific Company,
He rejected the proposed findings of the petitioner, because
the petitioner requested a finding that the Southern Pacific
was an employer. The District Judge knew he could not make that

I want to touch on a concept that -this Court has
developed in the FELA field, and it has to do with nondelegable,
the word "nondelegable".

One deals with nondelegable,,

Nondelegable refers to

It is not a concept developed by this Court which

creates employment.

Once you have employment and work for a

railroad and are an employee of the railroad, as all the cases
have held you have to be to come under the Act, then the
railroad has a nondelegable duty to furnish you a safe place
to work,.
And the fact that you send your railroad employee
out on another railroad or out to a shipper’s premises, and he
gets hurt in an unsafe condition there, you can’t say, as a
railroad, Well, we don’t owe you because you got hurt there.
No, you have a nondelegable duty.
which nondelegable came up*

And that’s the concept in

And the District Court became

confused with it.
Mow, as to operational activity.

That concept is

vary much confused by the Smith decision in the Fourth Circuit.
Operational activity is a concept which protects
employees who are in fact employed by railroads.

In Houston,

Texas, the Missouri Pacific contracted out its switching
business, and they had an employee in a railroad car, and the
switching company who was doing their operational work for them
ran the car into the Missouri Pacific car, in which a Missouri

31
Pacific admitted employee was standing, and hurt him.
And tills Court said this is really an. extension of
an agency principle.

You can't let someone else do your

operational work and then deprive your own employees of the
right of recovery,because they are your employees.
QUESTION:

That was because of the special history,

the FELA, the purpose for it,
MR, CORRIGAN:

Yes,

I think this raises another

very interesting point, and it's this:

If you analyze the

Act very carefully, you sea that there are three classes
involved.

There's a plaintiff class -- and the only plain­

tiffs that come under that Act and can recover are employees
of common carriers by railroad.

Not employees of agents of

common carriers by railroad.
This Court, in 1950 and again in 1959, said this
term "employee" and "employed" is not used in any special
sense.

It's just a conventional, v/hat the convention meaning

of the word "employee" is.

And if to be an employee you

have to be in someone's employment, you don't get to be an
employee of a railroad by being employed by an agent of the
railroad.
This Court made that vary clear in the Baker case
in 1959.
QUESTION:

Well, it requires that the railroad

itself direct and supervise and

QUESTION!

Mr* Corrigan, could I ask you what I

guess is just a purely mechanical question.

In the Appendix

there appear to be two sets of findings of fact and conclusions
of law.
MR, CORRIGANs
QUESTIONS

I can explain that,

One is at 28 and 29 and the other is 161,

Is one the ones prepared by you and the other prepared by
your adversary?
MR. CORRIGAN 1

The findings in the low-numbered

pages —
QUESTION:

Pages 28 and 29,

MR. CORRIGAN:

-- are the findings as signed by the

Court. The ones at the end of the book are the findings as
proposed by -the petitioner and as rejected by the Court.
The petitioner asked to have -the Court find that his client
worked for a railroad.

Petitioner’s attorney asked that,

and the Court said, No, I can’t find that.

He doesn’t work

for a railroad.
QUESTIONt

What, then,, the findings at 161 of

the Appendix weren’t ever signed by the Court?
MR. CORRIGAN:
QUESTION:

No, sir, they are proposed findings.

I note II, and that is, "Defendant,

Southern Pacific, by and through agreement with Pacific had
the right to exercise control over the details of the work
being performed by the plaintiff at the time of the
accident in question."
MR. CORRIGAN: That was a proposed finding.

it would be liable under FELA ~~
QUESTIOUs Well, I understand -that.
MR. CORRIGAN:
QUESTION;

Right.

I understand that.

Now, the —

How about the other railroad?

MR. CORRIGAN s

other railroad would be responsible

because it gave up an operational activity to the belt railroad,
and because it gave up an operational activity to the belt
railroad it cannot escape the consequences of the act to its
own employees, Mr. Justice -QUESTION; Well, how about to the bait railroad’s

35
employee?
That’s the question,, that I asked you.
MR. CORRIGAN:

Well, Missouri Pacific, under those

facts, would not be liable to the belt railroad’s employees
who were injured, because the belt railroad’s employees were
not under their control, they were not their employees, the
negligence was the act of the belt railroad and not the
Missouri Pacific.

So the Missouri Pacific would only be

liable to its own employees.
QUESTION: Even though, for purposes of the Act, a
fellow employee doctrine reached -the belt railway, in S inkier?
MR, CORRIGAN?
QUESTION:

I'm sorry, sir?

Well, tine belt railway, for some purposes,

was held identical with the other railroad,
MR, CORRIGAN:

Only for purposes

I was about to get to that, and I think I could explain it
this way, Mr, Justice.
QUESTION:

Well, that was an interpretation of the

word "agent" in the special section,
MR. CORRIGAN:

That's the next thing I want to come

to that's very important.

7. tried to describe three classes

that come under this Act:

the employee class, the employer

class, and now I’d like to talk about the third class, which
I think relates to your question, Mr. Justice White.
The third class of people or organisations referred

36
to in the Act are the people or organizations for whom the
railroads are responsible^

officers, agents and employees of

railroads.
Now, notes

the word "agent" is used with reference

to those people for whom a railroad is liable, for whose
conduct they’re liable.

The word "agent" is no way used

with reference to the employee class®

It’s used in one part

of the statute but not in the other.
There’s good reason for that.

We've quoted the

legislative history here quite extensively.

It was relied on

by this Court and quoted extensively by this Court six years
ago in Edwards vs. Pacific Fruit Express, and it was relied
oh specifically by the Circuit Court for the Ninth Circuit.
The legislative history is very clear that Congress
did not want teamsters or truck companies under the Act.
So I think that partially explains why the concept
of agency doesn't relate to the plaintiff class.
QUESTION;

Mr. Corrigan, the plaintiff in this case

was a member of the truckers' union, wasn't he?
MR. CORRIGAN:

Yes, sir, the Teamsters Union.

QUESTION: Tearbiters, right.

And was Pacific Motor

Trucking Company regulated m a trucking company by the
Interstate Commerce Commission?
MR. CORRIGAN:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: And by the California Commission?

37

MR. CORRIGAKs

Yes, sir.

It’s a motor carrier operating in interstate
commerce.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. CORRIGAN;

In nine western States.

There has been -~
QUESTION;

Are you paying compensation —

MR. CORRIGAN;

Pacific Motor Trucking Company.

They are paying for the pension and the medical and everything.
QUESTION:

Is there a prospect of double recovery?

MR. CORRIGAN;
QUESTION;

What’s that, sir?

If there were a reversal here, would

there be the prospect of a double recovery?
MR. CORRIGAN:

Well, I’m sure that Pacific Motor

Trucking Company •— you've asked the question for which I
can't find any legal authority one way or another.
QUESTION;

Your friend said he hoped so, and he

was going to try to bring that about.
MR. CORRIGAN;

And I'm sure the Pacific Motor

Trucking Company would work, Your Honor, on the opposite «—
for the opposite results.
You know, there's something else about this case
that's very important, and it's this.

Because railroads have

been around a long time, people think in terms that they
should be able to do everything for themselves, because at one

38
time they did.

They had their own carpenters a hundred years

ago, their own plumbers, their own sheet metal workers, and
everything.

But you don’t live in that kind of a world any

more.
The work -that was being done by Mr. Kelley in this
case was not railroad work, it was teamsters’ work.

the
9

record in this case ..specifically the testimony of Mr. Cawkins,
shows the following to be true, and I think this is very
important.
This trucking company was organized and formed in
the early 1930’s, and about 1937 they built highway trailers,
the truck company, the PMT, to carry automobiles along the
roadway in trailers, the drive away type thing.

And -the PMT

employees, like Kelley, in 1937 loaded and unloaded those
trailers.
About 1950, the railroads started what was known as
piggy-back service.

That piggyback service was flat cars on

which they would put vans, trucks.

And a little lator, one

of the kinds of vans or trucks they put on the railroad cars
•rare these highway trailers that, carried automobiles, 'the
actual truck"trailer with the automobiles on it was tied on
the railroad car, and it was a form of piggy-backing.
The same teamster employees who were performing that
work since '37 performed it in the loading and unloading on
the railroad cars; the loading and unloading.

39
Then in the early Sixties, the railroads, the
railroads of this country, designed what’s known as bi-level
and tri-level cars and they did away with putting the truck,
the autos on the trucks on the cars, they just put the cars
on the train, on the railroad cars — the automobiles on the
railroad cars.
But the significant thing is this:

the same

employees, the same teamsters, like Kelley, who had been
there eight years doing this work, continued to do the work,
it was never done by railroaders.

And why should anyone

suppose it should be done by railroaders?
There's a lot of work that comes under a railroad
cap -that is not railroad. There are a lot of peripheral
industries that work with a railroad, and their activities
are carried under a tariff.
There are cases in our brief on that.
But they are not railroading.

This Court said,

six years ago, the last case decided on the question of
coverage under the Act, was Edwards vs. Pacific Fruit Express.
This Court said there are a lot of things that look like
railroading but they are not railroading.
In the Edwards case, that company owned railroad
switch engines, had tracks, moved boxcars, owned cars, did
switching, but they weren’t a common carrier by rail.
Not being a common carrier by rail, their employees couldn’t

40
come under the Act.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Corrigan, if you prevail here, I

suppose you think that the Ninth Circuit opinion does not open
the way to a railroad’s avoiding FJ3LA liability by contracting
out various things, such as maintenance and the like?
MR. CORRIGAN;

No.,

I'd like to address myself to

that question, sir.
In the first place, we have to look at it in the
context that contracting out to avoid the Act would be bad,
if you were avoiding it with reference to your obligations to
your own employeese
QUESTION:

— [inaudible]

MR. CORRIGAN:

Yes, sir.

Which Kelley was not in this case.

We always have

to start there. Kelley was not an employee of the railroad.
Now, contracting out, sir, can be prevented if it's
evil, if the ~~
QUESTION:

Be in contravention to section 5„

Is

that what you’re talking about when you say "evil"?
MR. CORRIGAN:

Yes.

If it's wrong ■— I'm not sure

that it would be in contravention of section 5, contracting out.
QUESTION:

Well, of the Act, of some part of the Act

then?
MR. CORRIGAN:

Yes.

If it is, and I don't agree that

it is, but let's assume for 'die purpose of argument -*• well,

41
no, 1 can't agree that contracting out is prohibited by the
Act.
What's prohibited by the Act is taking a release
from an employee, than he signs up for employment;
not to sue you".

"I promd.se

That’s what section 5 is all about.

But section 5 doesn’t deal with contracting out.
You see, contracting out can be handled by other laws and
institutions, not by an improper interpretation contrary to
legislative intent of the FELA,
The FELA said, the Congress said, and this Court
said Congress said it, six years ago, that idle FELA only
applies to employees of railroads.
Now, with that in mind, this Court shouldn't strain
to worry about contracting out and in the process improperly
interpret the FELA.

For this reasons contracting out will

be prevented by the Railway Labor Act and by the United
Transportation Union,

If a railroad decided it would be a

good idea, to contract out all the work of our locomotive
engineers, the union could file a section 6 notice, and there
would be a nationwide strike sooner or later, and they
couldn't do it.
So I think it's so highly theoretical, and to worry
about theoretical thing like that and interpret the Act where
it shouldn’t go, where this Court says it shouldn't go, six
years ago, would be 'wrong.

42
Another thing I want to point out to you about
contracting out, why it wouldn’t work;
The railroad operations, take a train leaving from
San Francisco to Salt Lake City, is a very integrated type of
operation»

The engineer has to rely on the conductor for his

signals, who has to rely on the brakeman, who has to rely on
the dispatcher, who has to rely on someone else»

If you

contracted out the work of the conductors or the brakemen or
the engineer, those people would still be controlled by the
railroad, because they would be: so integrated, and this Court
wouldn't have any trouble finding, if the contracting out came
to pass -- which it won't — this Court wouldn't have any
difficulty finding the railroads still maintaining control,
the conductor still telling the engineer when to move, the
train dispatcher still telling them when they can leave the
station,

the train master is still running the shows
There, will still ba requisite control and supervision

over these employees who have been contracted out*
So the railroad may think it's contracting oat, but
this Court would hold that the control is still there.

The

control that is not in the Kelley case.
QUESTION; Well, I don't know, Mr. Engel, are there
any — or Mr. Corrigan, whether there are any Pullman cars left
any more, but a Pullman car is typically a railroad function,
is it not?

Well, they didn’t say it wasn’t a

railroad function, they just ■»MR. CORRIGAN;

in Robinson.

What they said, what this Court said in Robinson vs,
Baltimore s Ohio, in 1915, that there are many things that
happen on a railroad that are not really railroading in the
sense that Congress intended in the Federal Employers Liability
Act.
QUESTION; Well, Mr. Corrigan, let me change my
question.

It’s a typical common carrier function, isn't it?
MR. CORRIGAN:

It's a common carrier function for a

railroad to pull a Pullman car if there are still Pullman cars,
yes, sir.
QUESTION:

Yes.

And the car looks from the outside

much like all the other cars.
MR. CORRIGAN;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

But the Court held that the Pullman car

employees were not — if I recall correctly **“ were not
employees of the railroad.
MR. CORRIGAN;

Yes, sir.

And didn’t come under the

Act.
QUESTION:

And, more important, did not come under

the Act.
MR. CORRIGAN:

Yes, sir

44
QUESTION;

It would have been entirely appropriate#

would it not# for Congress to have put Pullman car employees
under the Act# since they're pulled by the same engine?
MR. CORRIGANS That's — yes# sir# whatever Congress
would have wanted to# but Congress didn't want.to and this
Court said they didn't want to# in the Robinson case,

We

have extensive legislative history# Your Honor# in our brief#
and this Court

quotas extensive legislative history in the

opinion in the Edwards case# which I keep coming back to# by
J us ti ce B1 a ck *
This Court relied on it# arid this Court said that
there was a great deal of legislation dealing with railroads
in the decade of the Thirties# wherein# Congress# if it wanted
to, could have included other people. But Congress specifically
excluded other people, and they specifically excluded teamsters.
Then when we got around to the '39 amendment of the
FELAt Congress was ask-3d to include trucking companies' and
teamsters, and Congress said no.

And the Ninth Circuit is

cognizant of that# and they make the reference to the report
in thei^ opinion.
But I urge upon you that riot only the Ninth Circuit
is aware of it# but this Court was aware of it# and this Court
relied heavily on it in the Edwards case.
I want to allude to another thing that’s important.
Thera is no particular kind of railroad activity that is inagic#

45
if you're doing a certain kind of work you must be a railroader*
When this Court interpreted the ’39 amendment in a
case called Reed vs «.
said?

Pennsylvania Railroad, this is what it

The railroad was all upset because Mrs. Reed was a

clerk, and the window blew in in her office and cut her on
the face.

And they said, Well, you’re not a railroader, you

don’t have soot in your face and cinders in your hair and
calluses on your hands, you’re a clerk? you can’t have
recovery under this Act.
And this Court said, what counts is, in order to
come under the Act, not what you do, you can be a clerk and
come under this Act.

And sine® that opinion, every clerk has

come under this Act.
What counts is that you have to be in the employment
of a railroad which -- and doing work which closely or
substantially affects interstate commerce.
Mr. Kelley was not in the employment of a railroad.
It was specifically so held by the trial court.
I think that, for whatever reasons, there is a
direct conflict, and there’s no way around it, between tbs
Fourth Circuit and the Ninth Circuit,

And the legislative

history was interpreted by this Court, and the decisions in
Robinson of -this Court, and Baker of this Court, clearly
indicate that the Fourth Circuit is in error in that one case,
Thera's only one case, it’s Smith vs, IJgrfolk ^ Western, in

46

which they said, You find that Mr. Smith is not an employee
of a railroad, but it doesn’t matter to us, hers the employee
of an agent of the railroad.
And the Ninth Circuit recognized, as this Supreme
Court has recognised on so many occasions, that

isn’t enough.

You have to be an employee.
QUESTIONS

Is there anything in the Edwards case,

which I see you have reason to be familiar with, that indicated
that tine Pacific Fruit Express was owned by either one or a
combination of railroads?

Southern Pacific Transportation Company and fifty percent by
the Union Pacific Railroad Company.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF R. J« ENGEL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR» ENGEL:

Briefly, Your Honors.

The conclusion of law that I proposed to the trial
court was a conclusion of law which the Court can find at
page 163 of the index [sic], where I stated that Mr. Kelley
was a, quote "employee", end quote, of the defendant. Southern
Pacific.
The trial court did not reject a fact-finding of
employment, and what the trial court did is it rejected my
use of the term "employee" in quotes.
QUESTION:

Nell, he did reject your proposed

Finding II, didn't he?
MR, ENGEL:

Nell, there were some that he did

reject, Your Honor, yes.
QUESTION:

Well, I mean that's the one, it seems to

me, that has some relevance here.

That's the one that seems

them tliat were combined up.

There were several of

And one of them, of his,

specifically says they had the responsibility and control.
I think it's rather clear that he found, as a matter of fact,
that they had the control.
And the -QUESTIONs

That isn’t quite os strong an argument

as it would be if he had not been presented with an explicit
finding about employment and rejected it, or at least failed
to adopt it.
MR. ENGELs

Well, Your Honor, he rejected my use of

putting "employee" in quotes, as a conclusion of law.
QUESTION;

He could have just taken the quotation

marks out of .it, if he wanted to find that your man was an
employgo.
MR. ENGEL;

And what ha did, though, Your Honor, is

that he changed the language of ray conclusion of law and added
a fact that I — a conclusion of fact that I had not proposed,
and that was his proposed

or his Finding IX, which

specifically — and I had not offered that.
It says;

"The work being performed by the plaintiff"

-- and this is the finding that brings the plaintiff within the
relationship to Southern Pacific Company because of the nature
of the work he was doing.
QUESTION;

But he never said that he was an employee.

49
HR, ENGEL?
QUESTIONS
MR* ENGEL;

No# Your Honor, and because —
He rejected that.
He rejected my conclusion of law, where

the term ’’employee" was used, yes.
QUESTION;

And that’s the word that’s used in the

statute?
MRC ENGEL:

Yes.

But in Baker

QUESTION; And he rejected that.
MR. ENGEL:

But in Baker vs..Texas, which is the

test, and. this -- what is being argued here is that Southern
Pacific Company wants this Court now to go back and rephrase
or reword or change Baker vs. Texas, wherein this Court, at
that time, and what has been the rule for many years now,
■that you make a factual determination as to whether the
person is an employee, as that term in used within the FELA.
It is not that you make a factual determination
that the person in fact is an employee, it's a matter of
creating a class of individuals on an individual case basis,
as to whether an individual fits within the coverage of the
FELA.
And what we are doing here is what the Ninth
Circuit did not do, and that was to recognise that it's a
factual conclusion and a factual determination for the
District Court to make, and what is happening is what is
happening here

50
Each case now would be re-argued and re-argued?
because there is no rule coming from this Court as to a
guideline whereby the District Courts can use.

This Court

has set down that guideline in Baker? and it says .it's a
factual determination for each judge to do in each individual
case.
And that's the rule that they're challenging.-

They

want this to have — be a matter of law, to take away from the
District Courts the ability to make a factual determinations
QUESTION: Well, but, Mr* Engel? the conclusion of law

you proposed at 163 was that the plaintiff was an employee
of -the defendant.
MR. ENGEL:

In quotes, yes.

QUESTION: The conclusion that Judge Zirpoli reached?
the conclusion of law on page 30 of the Appendix? is really
quite a different reasoning process? isn't it?

Than yours,

relvihd on Baker vs. Texas and Pacific.

MR. ENGEL:

- Hi

«•. **.V--* •mu.-Tf--."»

«**T**‘*■*-.'<*■*•-*V'JT»

Well? I don't think so? Your Honor?

because Baker vs. .Texas said it's a factual determination
depending on what the work that was being performed at the
time of a given injury? and what the Court has done in its
factual conclusion her© is characterized the kind of work that
was being done that supported the Court's conclusion that he
was entitled to coverage.
QUESTION:

Bat he was unwilling to say that your man

51

was an employee of Southern Pacific.
MR. ENGEL:

Judge Kirpoli was.

That’s correct.

He chose to

characterise it by the nature of work as opposed to a label
as to whether he's an employee or agent or borrowed servant,
or whatever, he characterized it by the nature of work that
Mr. Kelley was doing.

And because of the nature of work

that he was doing, he was entitled to FELA coverage, and
that has been the standard test this Court has promulgated
since Baker and long before, back in 1927, with regard to
the doctrine of borrowed servant.

It was the nature of work

the individual was doing.
What Southern Petcific wants to do is to eliminate
the whole concept —
QUESTION:

But didn't he go through that process

and conclude, like the Act requires, that this man was an
employee of Southern Pacific?
MR. ENGEL: Well, why he chose to characterize it by
the nature of work
QUESTION:

Rather than reject your finding.

MR. ENGEL: Wehl, Your Honor, I don't know.

All I

know is that he chose to characterize it by the nature of work.
QUESTION: Well, I suppose, since he entered an
award in favor of your man, that there's implicit in it a
finding that he was an employee.
MR, ENGEL: Well, he's — certainly we have to assume

52

that tile judge is cognisant of what the statute reads, and
he cited the statute in his conclusions of law.
QUESTI Oils
MR. ENGEL:

Well, he did make an award, didn't he?
Yes»

QUESTION: Right.
QUESTION:
MR. ENGEL:

A dollar award.
Yes.

QUESTION: And the difference is, in the Smith case,
the Court of Appeals explicitly said that the plaintiff there
was not an employee, and then they went ahead and said,
nonetheless, he's covered by the Act.
MR. ENGEL:

No, that’s how Southern Pacific

characterizes it —
QUESTION: Well, I just read the opinion myself, and
I would think that would foe helpful to you,
QUESTION:

I would think so, too.

MR. ENGEL: What I’m saying is that what Smith said
and what the District Court here said is that depending on the
type of work that the parson was doing, as in Smith, that ho
does fall within -the FELA; and Smith recognised that -QUESTION:

Well, to fall within the FELA, everybody

agrees that you have to be an, quote, "employe®'', unquoteP of
tiie railroad.
MR. ENGEL:

Yes.

And there is no — the history of

having employees of independent contractors covered by the

53
FSLA is not a new concept, and that’s what they wish to
abolish.
QUESTION:

Is it of any significance at all, or

relevance, that Kelley has never recognized himself as an
employee of the railroad?
MR. ENGEL:

Well, the Restatement sets down some

thirteen factors, any one of which can be controlling and
no one of which is controlling? and one of them is that what
the parties understand the relationship, whether he thinks ~~
regarding who he thinks he is employed by or who they think
is their employee.

But that is only one factor that this

Court has previously said should be used by the court as a
guideline.
?md I think it’s of particular interest, if you
will, in my brief I show how the District Court went down and
made its findings to almost correlate precisely with the
Restatement test, which is the test that they wish to abolish-,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:50 o'clock, p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.}
