f-lR. CHIZ:F JUSTICE BURGER:

lie' 11 hear argwrents

next in 73- 1923 , Eastland against Servicemen's Fund.
llr. llillor, you may proceed whenever you' re ready.
ORl\L ARGUMENT OF HERBERT J. M:::tLER, JR., ESQ. ,
OU BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MILLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court1
The petitioners before this Court are the Internal
Security Co1!1111ittee of tho Senate, its Chairman, ~enator
Eastland, and several Senators, along with the general counsel
of the Subcorornittee, Mr. sourvine.
There are three additional cases involved in this
petition,

These petitioners are the Internal Security

COl'llltli ttee of tlte House of nepresentati ves, several individual
Congressrne~ rnernbers of that Collll'littee, the general counsel,
and the investigator of that committee.
I would like to call to the Court's attention that
just recently the House of Representatives has voted to
transfer the functions of the Internal Securit.y Committee
of the House of Representatives to another co1111'1ittee.
However, I do not believe it creates questions of rnootness
in the case here, for the one reason, if for no other, as I
read the complaints

:n

those three cases, as not only asking

damages specifically against the general counsel and investiga-

4

tor of that committee, but also requesting damages against
the individual Congressmen members.
In any event, the main case, the United States
Servicemen ' s Fund vs, Eastland , does not have that problem.
The question , the basic question at issue here is
another chapter and one that this Court has faced on several
occasions , as to the power of a coordinant branch of our
government.
Here at issue is a subpoena that was served by the
Senate Internal Security Coramit'tee,pursuant to a resolution,
upon a bank,
QtmSTIOU:

t·lho served it, !tr, !liller?

Or does that
MR. ltILLnR:

does that appear in the record?
I don't believe the record shows who

served the subpoena.
QUESTIOU:

t·Tell, they just didn't mail it --

11R, MILLER:

I do not --

QUESTION:

They

just didn't mail it, and I don't

suppose the Chairman took it d01-m there.
MR. itILLER:

not.

I have assurned tha't the Chairman did

All I can go by is what is alleged in the coMplaint,

Mr. Justice Hhite, which says, as to the third subpoena,
which is the only subpoena before this Court, that the
defendants, which would be Senator Eastland and the other
Senators and defendant Sourwine, quote, "caused the subpoena

5

to be issued. "
I find that in paragraph 16 of the complaint.
QUllSTION:

Doesn't it say -- it must alleqe that it

was served, doesn ' t it?
MR. !!ILLER:

As I read the complaint, sir, it does

not.
QUESTION:

Doesn ' t?

IIR. MILLER:

QUBSTION:

Just says it was issued.

I believe the record is silent on that.

Unh-hunh.

And all the allegation is that it was issued.
MR. IIILLER:

The defendant caused ~e subpoena,

quote, "to be issued".
QUESTION:

Well, is that -- and that is what the

injury is, apparently just from the issuance?
MR. !!ILLER:

Is that all?

The coMplaint then goes on and

alleges that the subpoena is void untl&r the First, Fourth,
Fifth, Sixth and l!inth Anendments, and says that -- and the
Tenth Arnendl:\ent -- and that the sole purpose of the subpoena
is to chill the First Amendment rights of the United States
ServiceMen' s Fund.
N0\1, the relief requested in the complaint is that
the C".her.li.cal Dank, to whom the subpoena was addressed, and the
Senators and the staff be enjoined frol'I seeking to enforce the
subpoena, and also to have the subpoena declared null and
void.

6

The records sought were, according to the evidence
adduced at the preliminary hearing before the District Court ,
and the record is quite sparse on that, 3pparently dealt with
the normal bank records, cancelled, or copies of cancelled
checks, bank statements -- although the record is very, very
weak on this point.
Also there is no showing as to the number or al!\Ount
of the records that were in fact in the hands and the custody
of the bank.
It is, however, clear -- it is, however, clear, and
I think this is a very important part of this case -- that the
plaintiffs below and respondents here were seeking records
belonging to the bank, the recipients of the subpoena, and
were not seeking to enjoin the production of records which
in fact belonged to them.
The respondent here is a non-profit corporation,
it has a tax-exempt certificate, and has in fact filed with
the Internal Revenue Service returns which specify certain
contributors to this organization.
The activity of the United States Serviceman's Fund,
as shown by the evidence in the court below, was to establish
coffee houses adjacent to military bases and to have discussion
with respect to many itens controversial or not,

There was

also a demonstration that the primary function of this
committee was -- or of the Fund -- to discuss the Vietnam War

7

and to take 11hatever steps they could take, by terms of
persuasion, eclucation, and similar stops to demonstrate that
the Vietnam Har was one which should not be a part of the
American effort,
QUESTION:
11R. lULLER:

QUESTION:

Mr. Iii ller.
Yes, Your Honor?
I don't know 11hether it's of any

importance or not, but since the question arose and you have
undertaken to answer it about the subpoena, I had thought, and
I find that r.,y memory was correct, that on page 13 of 4:he
Appendix there is an allegation in paragraph 9 at the bottom,
that the Senate Committee, Subcornru. ttee, caused to be served
on the Chemical Dank of New York a subpoena duces tecum.
MR. IIILLER:

If my memory serves me correctly,

Your Honor, that is the first subpoena.

There are three

subpoenas that were served in this case.
The first was withdrawn,
refers to that subpoena,
QUESTIOll :

I believe that allegation

That subpoena was withdrawn.

lle're just concerned witl1 the one on 16,

then?
llR. MILLER:

He are just concerned with the

third subpoena.
The second subpoena was served, but ~e time to
comply was so short that at the request of the s~ rvicenen' s
Fund the Committee withdrew the second subpoena.

1\nd then

8

the third sul>poena issued.
And, as I say , as I read the complaint -- as I read
the complaint, the onl y allegation is that defendants caused
the subpoena to be issued, and that, sir, is the third
subpoena.
The Court of Appeals ruled that there was no immunity
attaching to the conduct of the petitioners in this cause,
under the speech and debate clause.
I think that the decisions of this Court clearly
demonstrate that there is in fact Senatorial immunity with
respect to the authorization of this investigation, with
respect to the issuance of the subpoena, and, in fact, I would
go one step further, even though the fact is not in the
record and say with respect to the service of the subpoena,

·----...

This Court, in Gravel and in Doe vs. McMillan, has
.... ... -~--·-·-•·-•.......... _.__ .. _
given a careful and thoughtful consideration to the requirement of the coordinate branch of government, namely, the
Congress of the United States, to participate in their
legislative proceeding without fear, without fear of either
intimidation hy the Executive or being called before, as the
cases say, a potentially hostile Judiciary,
And they have gone further, the cases have gone
further and say:

and in addition to that, n-embers of Congress

should not be burdened with the difficulty of defending suits
which are brought against them for acts performed in the

9

legislative sphere.
Thus, we already have the fact that voting,
committee reports , authorizing committee investigations and
receiving materials pursuant thereto, introducing material
at committee hearing, referring cornnittee report to the
Speaker, distributing and using reports for legislative
purposes are all within the legislative sphere and immune from
any kind of action under the speech and dehate clause.

___________

_,.. vs. !1cMillan
Furthermore, if we prescind from Doe
and the Gr?.~ case, and go back to the case of ~~r~~'i!,

__

vs.... Eastland
_,..
....... - ....."- and examine what was held there in the Court of
Appeals and, in fact, in the Supreme Court of the United
States, and ue will find that the allegation in that case
was that the defendants tortiously conspired to subpoena
records in an illegal manner from a Louisiana un-.i\merica~
Activity Committee who had the record belonging to the
plaintiff in that case,
The Court of Appeals flatly held that the actjons
pursuant to that subpoena, in so far as the Senators and the
general counsel of the committee were concerned, were
absolutely and totally immune,
The Court of Appeals affirn3d -- I mean, the Supreme
Court affirmed that part of the decision which dealt with the
Senator, pointing out that there was no evidence in the
record to connect him with any of the activities, with the

10

exception of the authorization of the subpoena and authorizing
its service:
That case is a flat holding that the conduct here is
not subject to review but is tota·lly immune under the speech
and debate clause.
The other factor which can be dra'l-m from decisions
of this Court, t h e ~ case and

~~2.!•

is that even

unconstitutional conduct by members of the Congress and,
reading those cases, their aides, if within the legislative
sphere, are not subject to review by this Court or any other
forum .
That is the holding of those cases.
Furthermore, prescinding from the speech or debate
clause and going to the basis of the coordinate branch of
government theory, namely separation of powers, the doctrine
which was discussed in the Doe case along with the speech and
debate clause, and in the Gravel case, points out that the
Judiciary, where there is an immunity such as exists under
the facts of this case, may not interfere with the action of
Congress.
on this I should emphasize, as this Court did in
McGrain ~s. Daugher~, that the absolute necessity for an
informed Congress is the ability to subpoena individuals and
to subpoena documents.

And that any inhibition on that power

is in effect an inhibition on the ability to legislate wisely,

11

'l'he Court of 1\ppeals pointed out that the documents
subpoenaed in this case were bank records and that the
evidence that was adduced before the District Court, District
Court Judge Gasch, demonstrated that the -- what the real
concern of the respondents here were in fact loss of contributions.
Thus we had testimony by professional fund raisers
and by representatives of this organization that there were
anonymous contributions, there were contributions by
cashier's checks from brokerage accounts, there were
contributions from corporations that were, quote, "fronts",
unquote, from individuals and, in fact, there was one example
-- and I don ' t know whether it was hypothetical or not
where the individual testified that the real anonymity was
achieved where you had lunch with a donor and took cash at
the lunch table .

.

.
These were the types of anonymous contributions
•

which the re~pondents apparently felt would be disclosed should
the bank records be made public,
Although, I hasten to add, the record does not show
what the bank record in fact contained with respect to the
names of contributors or not.
This brinqs us to a very interesting part of this
case because here we have an attempt to equate the raisinq of
funds, the contributing of money, by a non-profit, tax-exempt

12

-- by a ruling -- organization, and as distinguished from any
showing that the membership of that organization is connected
with or tied to contributions.
Now, the argument has been made, and I must enphasize
to the Court, in the brief filed by respondents, they state at
page 41, 42 or 43 that the Speech or Debate Clause was not
mentioned by the government, who represented the respondents
before the Court of Appeals.
And I think if you will look at the brief that was
filed on behalf of these respondents in the Court of Appeals,
there is a long and extensive section on the Speech or Debate

--

--

Clause, citing Dombrowski,
Doe v. McMillan,
and all of the
...
-.... ...
-'·

other cases.

I would not want the Court to think that this issue
was one just raised before this Court, because it has been
raised in the trial court and in fact before this Court.
Dut we are now in a position where what the
respondents are arguing and have argued is that bank records,
which show potentially the source of contributors, if they
not be in cash, is something which is covered by the First
Amendment, freedom of association.
And I submit to the Court that nowhere has this Court
or, to

my

knowledge, any other court gone so far.
If, in fact, records of a bank which deal with moneys

received by an organization, whether it be the United States

13
Servicemen ' s Fund or perhaps the Republican or the Democratic
Party - QUESTION:

fir. Miller, this is really a separate

argument , then, from your Speech or Debate Clause argument,
isn' t it?
P1R. PIILLI!R:

QUESTION:

It is, Your Honor.
Because if you 11in on the Speech or

Debate Clause, it doesn ' t matter whether these records are
protected or not.
MR. HILLER:

That's correct.

That is correct.

And that's what -QUESTIOH:

It's a separate arql.Ullent from your

separation of powers argument too, isn't it?

There's a

third argument you think.
QUESTION: I-Tell, Mr. Miller, I'm not so sure about
that, that if you w,in

on your Speech or Debate Clause issue

the case is over.
MR. l!ILLER:
QUESTION:

I believe it is, sir.
Hell, I would have thouqht that if the

-- let's just assllf.\e that the riqhts of the organizations are
violated by the amendment, in the sense that -- and then the
-- in order to get off the hook you have to plead legislative
immunity,

Let's just assume that.
How, if they send a nan out to serve a subpoena or,

say, serve a search warrant or to nake an arrest, and the

14
arrest or the search is unconstitutional, I would suppose
the fellow they send to do that could be held liable for
damages.

That was Kilbourn v. _!horopson,
MR. MILLER:

Under Kilbourn vs . Thompson, that is

precisely the situation.
QUESTION:

Well, I would suppose then that if the

person who is serving the subpoena is coillMitting an unlawful or
unconstitutional act, he =uld not only be held liable for
damages but he can be enjoined
?IR, HILLER:

he can be enjoined,

If in fact it is beyond the legislative

sphere,
QUESTIOU:
HR. lllLLER:

t'lell, it's a
he can be enjoined.

QUESTION: Well, it's -··
MR, HILLER:

lfy argument, if the Court please, is

that it is not.
QUESTION:

Hell, I understand.

Issuing the subpoena,

you say, is in the legislative sphere.
MR. MILLER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,
But if the subpoena itself is -- if it

invades some constitutional rights of some others, at somewhere
along the line, at least where it actually impinges on somebody, !i_;.!.~9.~.E. _v. 'l'.'!.<?.~l!.'?.11 would indicate that courts cun
intervene ,

The legislators who order the unconstitutional act

cannot be held liable for damages, and they can't be enjoined

15
from issuing another one.

But I would suppose the bank can

be enjoined from compl yin g .
tlR. MILLER:

QUESTION :
UR. llILLER:

I would
I know.
That is a part of the equation, if the

Court please , where eventually you would end up:

Can a

third party , who controls the records, in fact be enjoined?
But - QUESTIOM:

I think in Gravel

in Gravel and the

other cases, we had expressly said that a Senator, neither a
Senator nor his aide can go out and break into somebod}•' s
house to illegally, in order to qather information for a
hearing,
tlR, HILLER:

(lUESTIOU:

I reme1T1ber your language very well,
Yes I I thought you would.

[Laughter. J
QUESTION:

You never got to the third-party question

here, did you, because the banks were never served,
I-IR. IIILLCR:

The banks were in fact defendants in

this suit, they just did not participate in the appeal.
QUESTION: llell, did you get to the point, according
to the record, where the banks were about to produce the
records?
MR, IIILLER:

In. one of the House of nepresentatives

cases, one or more, the bank did in fact produce some of the

16

records.
But those three cases , I want to emphasize to the
Court , really are -- while they' re a part of this case, they
are in effect a t agalong, because everyone has treated the
Eastland case as the case that governs all of then, even though,
when you get down into the facts, you realize there are some
different factors with respect to the other three.

But the

District Court and the Court of -- well, the District Court
did not deal with the House of Representatives cases, they
went before other judges and were, the subpoenas were enjoined
because the Court of Appeals had entered a temporary restraining order against the Eastland subpoena,
QUESTION: Well, !Ir. tliller, let me just ask you:
Suppose that the Senators and the Congressmen and t.~e
Committee had never been parties to this suit, the only party
to the suit was the bank, and the case -- the complaint mere l y
asked -- well, it asked for a declaratory judgment and an
injunction against the bank.

Declaratory judgment that, being

forced to produce these records would violate th9 constitutional rights of the organizations,
And would you say that -- the bank certainly can't
claim legislative immunity?
MR. IULLER:

!Ir, Justice t'll1ite, --

QUESTION: Can it?
MR, MILLER:

l1r. Justice -- let me -- of course it

17
cannot claim legislative immunity. nut the case you put, it
would be fine, and if that is -- if that is the way the Court
will treat the opinion below, and leave within the leqis lati ve
sphere the Senators and the aides, because they were in fact
totally immune by their activities under the Speech or Debate
Clause, then and only then do we address the question:
Does there stand -- can an individual whose records are with
the bank file some type of an action against the bank; a
motion to quash or subpoena -QUESTION:
MR. MILLER:

But the bank isn't --- that, sir, is not the case that

we have before the Cour.t today.
QUESTION: nut the bank isn't off -- doesn't get
off the hook just because the Senators might be immune?
MR. MILLER:

I would not argue that to the Court,

because
QUESTION: l'lell, I thought you were a while ago.
MR.MILLER:

No, sir, not at all.

t-lhat I'm arguing is that under the Speech and Debate
Clause, under the concept of separation in powers, the
individual Senators and Congressman and their staff aides
and counsel, under the facts of this case, are totally
immune from the conduct alleged here under the Speech and
Debate Clause,
That is, I think, a flat -- that is my flat position

18
and i t is one that is supported by existing case law, recent
and past.
QUESTION;

Hhat is the impact, right today, here and

now, of the judgment of the Court of Appeals on the Senators?
MR.. MILLER:
reinstated

They are

the Court of Appeals

-- the Senators were dismiseed as defendants by

the trial court, the Court of Appeals reinstated them and
sent the case back for further proceedings, suggesting that if
some type of relief was necessary against the Senators, that
perhaps -- and they picked up a suggestion that a declaratory
judgment had been requested -- perhaps it would be appropriate
to enter a declaratory judgment.
However, there was no requirement, as I read it in
the Court of Appeals decision, that it be limited to a
declaratory judgment.
QUESTION:

Hell, Mr. Miller, you said that, I gather,

the banks aren't here; they didn't appeal what?
MR, HILLER:
QUESTION:
MR. HILLER:
QUESTION:
l!R. MILLER:

They did not appeal,
From what?

What did they

They took no steps with respect to -t-lhat was the judgment against the bank?
There was no judgment against the

bank.
QUESTION: Right,

llR. UILLER:

The Court denied the motion for injunc-

l!>

tion against the Senate Cornr.1i ttee and the senators.
The Senators appealed.

The Court of Appeals

reversed and sent the case back.
The banks did not, to my knowledqe, participate in
the Court of Appeals.
QUESTIO?I:

I-Tell, so that, on remand, is there

open whatever remedy may issue against the banks?
MR. UILLilR:

I do not know the answer to that.

I would -- I really don ' t understand quite where the banks
fit into this in the trial court.
QUESTION:

The one thing is sure, that the Senators

are kept in the case and not dismissed by the Court of
Appeals?
l!R. ?lILI.r.R:

QUESTION:

Absolutely.
And there's a judgment -- there is, at

least, authorized the judgment to be entered against them.

MR. MILLER: The Court of Appeals decision authorizes
a judgment against the Senators.

And if I say so myself, it

would be the only time, to my knowledge, that any such type -QUESTIOU:

But if we should reverse that, Mr, Miller,

there will still be, in this lawsuit, solllE!thing that involves
the banks?
MR. P.ILI CR:

The banks are, as I understand it,

are still defendants, an<i -QUESTION:

So even if you win, this lawsuit is not

20

completely over?

rm.

IIILLER:

I assume that they could still proceed

against the banks, to - - the banks are defendants unless
QUESTION: And if they do in that circwnstance, your
victory on the Speech or Debate Clause will not assist the
banks any, in their defense of the lro~suit.
MR.

MILLER:

I would think not, Your Honor.

I

would think not.
But let rne address myself to the -- quickly, to the
First Amendment question here, because I don't think -prescinding from the Speech or Debate Clause, I don't think
there is a First Jll!lendrr~nt question here,
Because if bank records are covered by the First
Amendment to the Constitution, then this Court is going to face
that issue when you get to the question of political contributions by your major political parties.
And I would submit, if the Court please, that if you
can bar the production of records of contributions, because of
associatiopal concepts under the First A.~endment, then the
reform legislation with respect to campaign contributions is
going to be a matter.: that ' s going to have to be either separated
or going to have to be ruled is not covered.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Gutman.

ORl\L ARGlntENT OP JT:REMil\ll S. GUT~ll\ll, ESQ. ,

on

BEIU\LF OP TIIE nESl'ONDEN'l'S

MR. GUTl11\N t

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The subpoenas in each of these cases were in fact

served, and the record is very clear that they were in fact
served.
'lbe problem as to the banks is jurisdictional.
1\ whole series of these actions were bequn, the

first one is not now before the Court, that was an action in
the Southem District of New York, called Liberation News
Service, which held that New York was the ir,proper venue
for beinging an action to get a determination of the validity
of such a subpoena as we have involved in these cases.
Therefore, the matter had to coMe down to the
District.
In the prime case here,

u. s.

Servicemen's Fund,

the bank is a New York City bank, Chemical Dank llew York Trust
Company, which is not present in the District of Columbia ,
Because of the eKigencies of time, that is, that the
subpoena was served and was returnable so quickly, and the
fact that part of the information was in fact delivered by a
bank before the depositor had notice of the service of the
subpoena, quick action had to be brought, and so an action was
immediately brought in the District, without even attempting

22

to get jurisdiction in the District of Columbia over the New
York Bank; was brought on quickly before the trial court,
a temporary stay was denied and an emergency stay was granted
by the Court of Appeals, and issue was joined in that way •

.

Because of the -- ine one of the -- in two, rather;
in two of the three House cases, the bank is a District of
Columbia bank, so there is jurisdiction over those banks in
those cases,

But that's not so in the prime case,

--------

Servicemen's Fund.

---

u. s.

The Chemical Bank New York Trust Company is not

before the Court, because it was never properly served.
QUESTION:

So, in that case, the only parties are

the congressional parties?
MR.

GUTlUIN:

QUESTION:
MR.

GUTMAN:

The congressional parties and staff.
Well, I include the staff in that,
Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION: So if you lose out here, that's the end
of this case?
MR, GUTH/IN:

Yes, Your Honor,

QUBSTIOtl: Right.
MR.

GUTl!AN:

What Judge Tuttle for the Circuit

ordered in his rer.iand to the District Court -QUESTION: Well, I take it, then, if you lose on the
immunity question, the case is over?
UR,

GUT/11\N:

We have to win if --

23

QUESTION:

I mean it's over as against these

congressional parties?
MR. GUTMAN:

If they are immune from declaratory

or injunctive relief - QUESTION:

Yes •

MR. GUTl!l\N:

We don't even ask for damages, rtr.

Miller misread our complaint -QUBSTiotl:

Yes, I understand.

MR. GU'l'IU\N :

we didn ' t ask for dnMages , and never

did.
If there is immunity of the -- either. the staff or
the Congress members or both, as to execution of process,
QUESTION:

Yes?
with respect to declaration or

MR. GUTMAN:
injunction , we're dead .

Sure.

QUE!3TION: Well, then, you never reach the First
Amendment ~uestion.

rm. GUTMAN:

Hell -- right.

I have to reach the

First 1\mendment question to show that process -- that I ought
to get a declan•tion or injunction.
Qtm"TION:

Well, I understand that.

The subpoena

You mean you think you could get an

injunction against a Congress attempting internally to get a
contempt declaration?
MR. GUTlfAN:

No.

Uo.

I can't -- I don't believe

that this Court could prevent the Congress, the congressional
Subcommittee or Cor.unittee from voting to refer for contempt
up the line, from the Subcoromittee to Committee to House,
et cetera.
But I do think, as in §1anley__;!!._w~g_i!!, in Chicago,
you could get an injunction against prosecution.

And that

was done in that case by adding the prosecutor,

No,

insisting the:!: you' re entitled to a judgMent like that
against the S11nators?
MR. GUTIWJ:

At this point, no, Your Honor.

At this

point, no.
What I think happened here is when Judge Tuttle

25

ordered a remand , what he said was I

I'm going to put these

congressional people back so that there can be a hearing in
the District to fashion whatever relief may be appropriate,
depending upon what can be developed as to the procedures and
responsibilities of the various staff members of the
Committee.
And he said the District court should be generous
in adding whatever parties may be necessary in order to give
relief.
/Ind those are staff people,

And I think complete

relief could be granted, once we know the facts.
If the Court please, with the permission of the
Court,our arrangement had been that Ms. Stearns was going to
deal with Speech or Debate, and I was going to deal with
First J\l\lendment and the other issues, but I seem, in response
to Your Honor's questions, to be getting into her territory.
So, if I may, I would like to reserve for her the
responses in this area.
But, of course, the First Amendment issue is
basically the whole thing.

If you buy llr, Miller's argument

that bank records of a membership organization are not
protected by the Alabama and Louisiana and Florida, and so on,
cases, and particularly the Arkansas case, ~~J.:.~rd__v~~l:!.~:t~,
well, then, we're finished; we never reach Speech or Debate,
/Ind it seems to us that in contemporary society,

26

where it is impossible to function without using the facilities
of a bank to clear your funds , whether they're cash funds
taken at a luncheon table, as tlr. Miller suggests, or they're
cashier' s checks , brokerage checks or direct checks from
individuals that are identifiable, the fact of the matter is
that these checks are microfilmed.
And it' s these very microfilms which were requested
in the very broad subpoena which was served in these cases.
Those bank records, in effect, are the membership
lists,

And in Pollard v. Roberts, which this Court affirmed,

th.., three-judge court on which Mr. Justice Blackmun sat, it
was exactly the case:

it was the Republican Party of

Arkansas and an attempt was made to subpoena the bank records,
and, at a suit of an officer of the Republican Party intervening
as the real party at interest, just as U, s. Servicemen's
Fund here comes in as the real party in interest, the Court
held that indeed the bank records are precisely the
equivalent of the NMCP lists in the Alabama and Florida cases,
And that they should, the production thereof was enjoined.
l\nd I see no distinction here,

And if this kind of

thing, this kind of protection is not afforded to bank records,
given modern society and the manner in which practically all
membership organizations work, you're going to be able to
destroy membership organization's anonymity and privacy.
Almost every membership organization must maintain

27

not only a bank account, in which the depositor's checks are
routinely inicrofilroed, so that the name nnd address of the
drawer of each iteM is available, but they also maintain
their membership lists upon computerized banks for purposes of
sending out their promotional mailing, and their dues '
notices and whatever else they do.
These things are the functional equivalent of the
membership lists which, before modern mechanics of office
management, were maintained in a secretary's file drawer in
the offics of the org,mization itself.
QUESTION: · Of course you've got more than that, too,
aren't there, Mr. Gutman?

They've got financial information

in addition to ways of identifying them.
MR. GUTll.l\N I

Of course, they have.

The problem here is , if the subpoena had been

against the s.ubpoena , too , of course, the organization would.
be able to respond and to say:

this Much we think you' re

entitled to, and this much we think you' re not.
If, as is alleged in the arguments in the lower
courts here and as stressed in Judge MacKinnon' s dissent
below, what they' re really after is to find out whether there
are subversive contributors or foreign governmental contributors to this plaintiff, or the respondent here, then the

28
question could be addressed in just that way.
QUESTION:

But the one that struck me about the

Court of Appeals opinion was the absence from it of any of
the balancing type of reasoning that you get in the Barenblatt
case and other types of things, where you're saying, basically,
what is Congress trying to do?

What are the First l\mendment

interests?
Quit:e apart from the Speech or Debate Clause, it

seems to ~e the Court of Appeals just concluded your clients
did have a First Amendment interest, therefore that -- it was
all over.
MR. GUTIIAN:

Yes, because the burden is on the

government.
There was a trial here, there were two trials, there
was a trial on the preliminary injunction and then it was
remanded with a stay by the Court of Appeals; when that was
denied, and the Court of Appeals reversed it, sent it back,
i t was sustained, and said:

uncontradicted proof as to the First Amendment delicacy and
the necessity of protecting these records.

all you have to do is be a member, and you can get the whole
membership list.
!IR. GUTIU\N:

That's quite different, Your Honor,

from a member, who is, after all, entitled under the First
Amendment, I would guess, to know with whom he's associating.

the First Amendment for you to issue an injunction against the

These subpoenas were issued in 1970, there have been two
Congresses since then.

MR. GUTMAN:

No, I think they shouldn't be treated

as moot in any event, Your Honor, because of the recurrence
of the problem.

That is, what difference does it make

whether the Comrni ttee -- a subpoena issued next week bears the
imprimatur of the llouse Internal Security Corranittee, or its
old name, the Un-American Activities Committee, or some new
name which they give it next week?

The issue will really

be the same if they try to get the same kind of issues.
QUESTION:

Do you want us to decide for all time

whether bodies of the House and Senate may issue subpoenas
against bank records, for bank records?
MR. GUTMAN:

No, I think -- you don't want that

the issue tendered isn't that broad, Mr, Chief Justice.
QUESTIOU: l'lell, it sounded like it there for a
moment.

You said that
MR. GUTMAN:

What I'm saying is that a subpoena

like this, of a membership

corporation, against a membership

group, addressed to securing from its bank every bit of
paper and every record that that bank has concerning that
organization, that should be declared to be a void subpoena.
Now, that doesn't mean that such a subpoena against
bank records can't be narrowly drawn and, in the proper case,

35

a::,propriately served.

If they wanted to know, for instance,

are there any foreign governrnent contributors to your
organization, they might have asked for that kind of record.
What I

'ni

saying is that the organization itself has

the standing to make the assertion and seek the relief,
even though it is not the record title owner, so to swe ak, of
the documents at issue.
And I believe they have signaled for ns. Stearns .
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

fl.s.

Stearns.

ORAL ARGUflENT OP 115. NANCY STuARllS,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MS. STEARNS:

tlr. Chief Justice, and may i t please

the Court:
This case is actually part of a long line of cases,
which begins with Marbury vs. t ~ ~ • Mc>Ves on to

!'.2!!-tl.L'!.ll.~

McCo~ck, and only this past summer includes Ul'!:i,,t;.e_<! .§..1:.~l!
vs. Nixon.
In the most recent of those cases, the Chief
Justice, speaking for the Court, reaffirmed that it's
emphatically the province and the duty of the judicial
department to say what the law is.
Here we have the same kind of problem.

l·le have a

Subcommittee of the Senate of the United States seeking to
evade judicial scrutiny for its acts, just as the Congress
of the United States, the House of Representatives of the

36

United States had in Powell, and the President of the United
States had in United States vs. Nixon.
At issue here is a double atteMpt to evade judicial
scrutiny.
QUESTION: Well, to pursue that analogy, if it• s
offered as an analogy, the case you referred to seems to me
to have held that when the Judicial Branch needs records to

perform its function, the Judicial Branch will get them, no
matter where they are.
Now, if the Legislative Branch needs certain records
to perform its function, certainly an argument could be made
that the Legislative Branch shall get them wherever they are .
MS. STEARNS:
two distinctions.

I would suggest there are at least

One, of course, is the fact that the records

here are First Amendr,l8nt material.
Another, however, is the subpoena has to be
scrutinized.

Is it in fact a constitutional subpoena?

Are

its limits appropriate constitutional limits?
Our problem here is the subpoena that was issued
has no group, no judicial authority scrutinizing whether or
not in fact that subpoena is constitutional.

Certainly --

QUESTION: Was there power in the District Court or
the Court of Appeals to narrow the scope of the subpoena, so
as, in its view, to avoid discloEing membership as such?
MS. STEARNS:

In this particular case?

37

QUF..STION:

Yes.

MS. STEARNS:

Well, we of course argue that there

would have been that power, but there were two problems:
No. 1, the subpoena was not initially served on the real
party at interest, the party whose rights were at stake,
and that was one of the forns of an attenpt to evade judicial
scrutiny, rather, the subpoena was served on the bank, a
stake holder who could not be expected to brave the whole
question of contempt and raise the constitutional rights of
its depositors.

That was the first problem.

The second problem, of course, is amongst the various
defenses the Committee is raising, is the question of the
Speech and Debate Clause.

If they were correct, then the

Court couldn't narrow, because the Court couldn't look at the
subpoena.
We, of course, argue that the Speech or Debate
Clause does not, in any way, prevent a federal court from
looking at a congressional committee subpoena, scrutinizing
it and considering and determining whether or not it's
constitu~ional,
But both of those attempts were made by the
Subcommittee, to evade judicial scrutiny.
The two reasons that we feel that the Speech or
Debate Clause is not appropriate and in fact cannot prohibit
the kind of judicial scrutiny that we request and feel is

38

appropriate, first, is because the Speech or Debate Clause is
inapplicable to actions for declaratory injunctive relief.
Secondly, because the very subject matter at issue
here, a congressional committee subpoena, is not the kind of
subject matter that is 'barred froM judicial review by that
clause.
QUESTION: What's your authority for the fact that
the Speech or Debate Clause doesn't apply to actions for
declaratory relief?
MS. STEARNS: Well, let me start by suggesting that
there has never been a case that I have seen that has in fact
held that,

And if we look to the most recent opinions of this

Court, we see very, very sharp distinctions made.
In the opinion of this Court written by

!lr.

Justice

l'lhi te, in the Gravel case , one looks very closely and sees that
although damages are prohibited against a House of Representatives members or a Senator, that the actual actions are not
necessarily barred from scrutiny.
Therefore, for example, although the writ issued
-- excuse me, the authorizing resolution in l{ilbourn vs.
Thompson could not lead to a damage action against the House
of Representatives Member that voted for it, the writ itself
could in fact be scrutinized.
I think that's a distinction that was drawn quite
carefully in the Gravel case.

39

QUESTION:

Yea , but in the Speech and Debate

Clause cases, it seem to

Jre

one of the purposes of the clause

has been said to be that Senators and Congressmen should not
be called into court to even answer complaints, within the
scope of the clause.
MS. STEARNS:

I think that --

QUESTION: And that's part of the -- that's just to
keep them from being bothered so much.
MS. STEARNS :

There are several things that have

been said, one is that they shouldn't be in a position of
bearing the burdens of litigation, fearing the possibilities
of liability, either civil or criminal.
Here, we would suggest, there's no such fear.
If you talk
liability .

because, of course, there's no personal
If you --

QUESTION:

I know, but if you' re going to have to

-- if you're right, you have to answer, you have to hire a
lawyer, you have to hire Mr. Miller or somebody and pay them a
lot of money, and take your time and energies away from your
job,
MS. STEARNS:

The reality, Your Honor, is that in

this kind of a declaratory and injunctive action, in fact,
normally the government represents the Conuttee, as it did
in the two courts below, just as the government is involved
in defending the constitutionality of that Cornr:iittee's sub-

40

poena if there's a criminal contempt case that arises out of it,
It's no different.
QUESTION I

Well, isn't there another factor here?

You speak of having First lunendment rights chilled, isn't
there, perhaps a corollary, that if Senators and Congressmen,
who cause subpoenas to be issued, find that district courts
are entering injunctions against them, with the threat hanging
over them of the contempt power to be asserted against a
Senator or a Congressman, that that may chill Senators and
Congressmen from the performance of their legislative.
functions?
MS. STEARNS:

Your Honor, I would somehow doubt that

they would even consider violating an order of a court, so
that the problem of contempt is not a realistic one,

At

least I would certainly hope not.
But the one thing I'd like to suggest is that this
is a very, very narrow case.
QUESTION: Do you think that answers the problem?
MS. STEARNS:

Well, I think it I s part of the answer.

Another part of the answer, however, is that, in
reality, we're not talking about every congressional committee
subpoena, First Amendment or otherwise.

l-1?1at we' re talking

about is a very, very narrow range of cases.

Those cases

where the parties whose constitutional issues are at stake
cannot, hir,self, raise them, because the subpoena has been

41

served on the third party.
In all other instances, and this of course would
bring me to

My

next argl.ll'lent, in all of the other instances,

the constitutional questions that underlie the action are
able to be scrutinized.

They a:ce able to be scrutinized in

a criminal contempt situation.
Here, hcmever, we have this one narrow range.
QUESTION:

'!hat's because Congress then seeks the

aid of the courts, in order to enforce its subpoena.

Here

you haven't waited until that stage, you're asking the
Judiciary to intervene before the congressional process has
even begun.
MS. STEARNS:

We haven't -- of course we haven• t

waited, Your Honor, because we in fact can't \Tait.
If we had been the parties receiving the subpoana,
we would in fact have appeared, we would in fact have raised
our constitutional rights.

We may or may not have been held

in contempt.
Here, however, we did not receive the subpoena.
And I think that that probably brings us to the most basic
issue in this case, for we would argue that this is really
not a Speech and Debate Clause case; for, in fact, the
constitutionality of subpoenas is scrutinized by the courts
all the time in these criminal contempt situations.
This really is a question of separation of pQ1,1ers,

42

and when, as the Court of Appeals below and other Courts of
Appeals in parallel concert cases said, how to avoid
unnecessarily infringing on the rights of a coordinate branch
of government.
QUESTION: But no one would contend that the actions
of the Justice Department and the Executive Branch, in
prosecuting a defendant who had been cited by the Congress for
contempt, is a part of the congressional function; and that' s
why that never arises in those cases.

They're always allowed

to challenge the constitutionality.
But you're in quite a different situation here.
MS. STEAJU-!S1

l'lhat we would suggest, Your Honor,

is that the situation isn't quite that different at all, and
that, in fact, implicit in the subpoena is the obvious
possibility that what will follow is the Executive Branch and
the Judicial Branch becoming involved in using the full weight
of the government against the party upon whom the subpoena
has been served.
But here is the one example, where you can't expect
the subpoenaed party to raise all these constitutional rights.
Because the subpoenaed party is an uninterested, disinterested
third party, here a bank.
And, therefore, in this one very, very narrow range
of cases, you must in fact, weighing all these matters and
particularly weighing the fact that there's a First Amendment

43

right involved, permit that party, whose constitutional rights
are at stake, to come in and have the constitutionality of
the subpoena scrutinized.
we are not, and I repeat, asking for any damages
against the Committee members, we are not asking for any
prosecution of the COl!lllli ttee members.

In fact, as Judge

Tuttle pointed out below, even an injunction is not necessary.
Similarly, in Powell vs , McCormack, this Court
concluded that an injunction was not necessary because
certainly a coordinate branch of the government would obey,
would honor the ruling of this Court.

So all we're really

asking for here is the Court to look at this subpoena.

It's

no different, we would suggest, than the writ under which
Mr. Kilbourn was arrested, it is effectively exactly the same

thing, to look at that writ, to look at that subpoena, and
determine whether or not it's constitutional.
1\nd if it is not constitutional, why, then, declare
it unconstitutional in a declaratory jud~nt, and we would
certainly expect and hold that -QUESTION:

Would your argument be the same if there

were no staff members involved, just the Congress -- Cornrnittee
Chairman had issued the subpoena himself?
MS. S TE1\RNS ;

QUESTION;

Well --

You wouldn't think he was protected?

US. STEARNS:

Frankly, prior to Gray~!, I would

44

have assumed that there was some sort of difference between
staff members, but now I would think not.
QUESTION:

Well, since

MS. STEAnNS:

I would think that the senator is

in exactly the same position,
And the reason I think so -QUESTION:

You mean he could be?

MS. STEARNS1
QUESTION:

As

the staff member would be.

You mean he could be questioned?

MS. STEARNS:

There is a distinction between

questioning him personally, questioning his motivations and
issuing a declaratory judgment, saying that the subpoena he
issued and had authorized -- and had enforced, had served,
is unconstitutional; that the ruling of that, this Court, in
that instance would be no~ questioning his motivations,
QUESTION:

On what basis would it be unconstitu-

tional?
MS, STEARNS:

In this instance, on the basis of the

First Amendment, perhaps the Fourth and other Amendments,
But certainly, as Judge Tuttle held, under the First Amendment.
I think that the important question, and here words
are very , very sensitive, I think that there is a qreat
difference between saying that we're questioning the Senator
and saying tha~ his action, the subpoena he issued, is
unconstitutional,

Between asking for liability, either civil

45
or criminal , against a Senator, or asking that the subpoena
he issued, just like the writ in Kilbourn vs. Thonpson, is
unoonstitutional.
Because there's a big distinction between actual
speech and debate, and even committee reports, as in Doe vs.
McMillan, and the process , the legal process that goes out
beyond the llalls of the Senate or beyond the Halls of the
House, is not longer an intramural activity, characterized
QUESTION:

Well, this go~s to the bank, that's all,

It goes out of the Halls, it doesn't go out there, they send
the subpoena to the bank and the bank sends them the reoords.

beyond the Congress.

MS. STE.!L'lNS :

It's the -QUESTION:

Can you get an injunction against them

bringing them in?
MS. STEARNS:

It would be exactly the same thing,

Presumably, what we're getting an injunction against -- well,
we wouldn't get an injunction against the bank -- pardon me?
QUESTION:

The injunction is to the bank to bring

your records in.
MS. STEARNS:

We would again ask -- well, if we

could serve the bank properly in our situation, we couldn't
have unless we waited at the door for Chemical Bank to come
down and appear.

Chemical Bank was kind enough to notify

us, so that we could in fact go into court prior to that time.
But we could not serve ChGmical Bank in New York to make
them a party in the first place.
QUESTION:

That I s all I wanted.

QUESTION:

But you suggested something that

indicated a limitation, that certain acts had to occur in the
Halls of Congress.

If the Committee, a Subcommittee holds a

meeting in San Francisco or anywhere else in the United States,

STEARNS:

- - or a congressional coI'lmi ttee is in

session.
However, that does bring up the distinction that
was made in the Doe vs. McMillan case.

For example, if a

House member or a Senate member is to read a libelous report
on the Floor of the !louse, he is clearly immune.

If he

takes that same report and goes to his home territoxy an6
reads it again, he is no longer immune.
So there is a distinction in internal and external.
QUESTION:
tl16

Is that because of the four walls and

ceiling, or is that because he's not performing a legis-

lative function?
MS. STEA!lNS:

I think that it's both.

It s a

concept of what is an internal function and when it loses its
internal nature.
QUESTION:

I think if you read that case closely,

you will see that it relates to the fact that the Congressman
might be using that as part of the campaign for re-election,
and that that's the distinction.
f.lS. STEARNS:

~at, I think, is one distinction,

Your Honor; but I think there was also another distinction,
when the Court said that in fact the question of republication
could be looked into, and whether or not the republication in
fact went beyond what would normally be considered an internal
function.

48

We would therefore request that this Court affirm
the opinion of Judge Tuttle below, both as to the Speech or
Debate Clause and the First Amendment issue.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER1

Mr. Miller, do you --

you have a few minu~es left.
REBUTTAL ARGIDIBNT OF HERBERT J. MILLER, JR. , ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
Very briefly, if he Court please.

MR. MILLER:

In the Joint Appendix, in the Court of Appeals case,
I found the complaints for the three House of Representatives
cases, and I think if the Court will examine those, they will
find that damages were in fact requested, $500,000 against
defendants Pott and Sanders, as well as the bank.
And additionally, in paragraph 20, it
QUESTION:

sir?

Not this one that's here, that we have

before us?

rm. MILLJ:R: Yes, sir, one -- yes, the House of
Representatives cases.
QUESTION:

I would think that

QUESTION:

I thought we only had one case here.

QUESTION:

you'd be very satisfied if these

cases were moot?
MR. •ULLER:

Well, if the Court please, depending

on what transpires with respect to the Committee, I feel that

49

the Court should be aware that the status with respect to
what Congress has done, and (b) the fact that denages -- I
just wanted to clear the record up -- that damages, and there's
a general 2:equest for damages in paragraph 28(a) of two of
the complaints.
QUESTION: But not in the Senate case?
MR. MILLER:
QUESTION:

Not in the Senate case.

No, sir.

Well, is that in the one with the

District of Columbia bank in it?
MR. MILLER:

Yes, sir.

The other thing I would like to call to the Court's
attention with r.e!!pect to declaratory judgment is that this
Court has said that the Speech and Debate Clause protects
Congressmen not only from the consequences of litigation's
results, but also from the burden of defending suits; indeed,
the clause would, quote, "be of little valute if legislatures
could be subjected to the cost and inconvenience and
distractions of a trial upon the conclusions of a pleading,"
I submit that
QUESTION:

In one of these cases, was there not at

least a strong intimation that a Member of the Congress
served on -- well, a claim directed against an utterance,
right within the four walls of the Congress, to make it clear,
could totally ignore the process, and that any judgrn~nt
entered against him would be a nullity,

Isn't there some

so
implication of that kind?
MR. MILLER,

I don't recall that, sir.

I think it

is clear that it would in fact -QUESTION:
llR. tilLLER:

That it would be nulled.
-- yes, it would be totally -- a nullity,

because it would bring into total conflict the Judicial
Branch, which has as its -QUESTION:

In other words, it's the literal language

of the Speech or Debate Clause that shall not be called to
answer, would be braod enough to mean that he didn't have to
answer a complaint in a district court proceeding.
MR. MILLER:

I would interpret it that way.

On the other hand, there have been decisions which

suggest that, at minimum and/or at maximum, the Senator or
the Congressman is requirsd to at least file a motion to
dismiss.
That's a suggestion, it's not been a holding.
Thank you.
