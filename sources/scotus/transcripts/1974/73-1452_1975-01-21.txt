MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

V1& will hear arguments

next in 73-1452, Oregon against Hass.
Mr. Denney, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS H. DENNEY ON
BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. DENNEY:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

This case is here on the State of Oregon's petition

for certiorari to review a decision of the Oregon Supreme
Court holding that statements made by a criminal defendant
who has been advised of his constitutional rights in accordance
with the requirements of Miranda v. Arizona and who has
expressed a desire to talk to an attorney or has at least
inquired about the availability of counsel, may not be used
to impeach his trial testimony.
From the State's point of view, the holding of the
Oregon Supreme Court in this case denies to Oregon prosecutors
the right to use statements, evidence which is constitutionally
admissible under this Court's holding in Harris v. New York,
and we therefore seek reversal of the Oregon Supreme Court's
decision.
Perhaps from a broader point of view this case
presents the Court with an opportunity to delineate more
fully the extent of the holding in Harris, and I should hope
if the Court chooses to do so, that some of the tangential

4
material that is put in the brief of the petitioner in foot­
notes may be of some assistance.
Before I turn to the merits of the case, there are
two objections to the State*s being here at all that are
raised in the brief of respondent that I would lilce to deal
with very briefly.
The first of these is the contention that the State
of Oregon has no standing to be here because we are not
aggrieved by the judgment of the Oregon Supreme Court.

Well,

I think .it's fairly clear that a holding of the Oregon
Supreme Court that the State of Oregon may not use evidence
that is constitutionally permissible

does make us a party

aggrieved, and I don't think that the right of the State to
seek certiorari in such cases is open to very serious question.
The most recent case that I could find in which the State’s
petition for certiorari was granted in a similar case was
California v. Green in 1970, but I am sure there have been
many petitions sought since and certainly perhaps a few
granted, and certainly I don*t think this is an issue.
Of a litt3.e more substance perhaps is the argument
raised in Question One in the respondent's brief to the
effect that the State cannot prevail in this case because the
States are free to impose higher or different standards of the
constitutional guarantees of liberty, let me say, than those
enunciated in this Court's interpretation of the Constitution.

5
Well, we don't quite agree with the argument that
is advanced.

As we understand the law, of course, this Court

is the final interpreter of any question arising under the
Federal Constitution and the States are not free to predicate
any holdings contrary on grounds of the Federal Constitution.
We think, as I have indicated in the brief for the petitioner,
among other places, I think Cooper v. California clearly
implies what I have just said.
QUESTION:

Is that one of the cases we remanded to

the Supreme Court of California to ask them to state clearly
whether they acted on the Federal or the State Constitution?
Or is that another case?
MR. DENNEY:

I believe that was what was done in that

case, Mr. Chief Justice.

X am not positive.

I thinly Ker v.

California was another such case, and this is one that is
cited in the respondent's brief.
QUESTION:

You don't challenge the right of the

Supreme Court of Oregon interpreting its own search and
seizure constitutional provisions to come to a differant
conclusion than this Court?
MR. DENNEY:

Oh, certainly not, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

But my point —* incidentally, this is not the search and
seizure.

This is a confession question.

But my point is that

this case is just clearly not decided on State constitutional
grounds.

And I think I have indicated that in the reply brief.

To expand a little more fully on it, the State
constitution was not invoked in connection with this assignment
of error by either side below.

The State constitution is not

even mentioned in the opinion of the Oregon Supreme Court.
The court's opinion instead distinguishes this case from
Harris.

In addition, the cases on which the Oregon Supreme

Court relied, the Oregon cases of State v. Brewton and State v.
Neely, are themselves not predicated on the Oregon constitution
The State constitution isn't even mentioned in State v. Brewton
it is mentioned in State v. Neely, but only to say that we
are not predicating our holding on the Oregon State constitu­
tion .
Now, 1 cannot say that the State constitution did
not come up at all in this case because during the oral
argument in this case before the Supreme Court of Oregon,
the Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court asked if the
Supreme Court were not free to predicate its holding on the
Oregon constitution and reach a different result from v/hatever
this Court might reach.
We agreed that they had that power.
discussion ended there.

But the

So we submit that this case just

simply is not a case predicated on State constitutional
grounds, and I don't think there is anything in the record of
this case which would support what might otherwise argue for
a remand of this case for clarification.

7
QUESTION:

I gather the judgment does have a counter­

part in the self-incrimination clause.
MR. DENNEY:

Yes.

I believe it's set forth in the

respondent's brief at Article 1, Section 12:

"No person

shall be put in jeopardy twice for the same offense nor be
compelled in any criminal prosecution to testify against
himself
QUESTION:

So had they rested this decision on that

provision you would not be here.
MR. DENNEY:

Absolutely not.

But my point is they

didn't and that is why we contend we have every right to be
here.
Nowf turning to the facts of this case, the facts
are simple, relatively undisputed, and it Would be a trivial
case if it were not for the fact that the Harris issue is
clearly presented here.

Basically it involves the theft of a

bicycle out of the garage of a residence in Klamath Falls,
Oregon.

The owner of the bicycle and his father saw the

thief, who was, we think it clear now, defendant's accomplice,
drive the bicycle or ride the bicycle out of the driveway.
They gave chase, they ultimately intercepted the defendant's
Volkswagen, the bus, the defendant was driving it, the bicycle
was in the back.

The father and son recovered the bicycle

and called the police.
In response to that call, a State police officer

8

traced the Volkswagen bus and went to the defendant's home.
He advised him of his Miranda rights and his advice, incidentally,
included a specific warning that the defendant could stop
talking at any time, in addition to the usual four-fold right
to remain silent, et cetera.
Hass admitted that he had taken two bicycles that
day and he wasn't sure which one the officer was talking about,
ifpon further conversation, he said that he had given one
bicycle back, which I gather is his interpretation of the
incident where the father and son demanded it back, and that
he had concealed the other, and he agreed to sho*w the officer
where he had concealed the second bicycle.
On the way to the spot where the second bicycle
was concealed, however, Hass who already had admitted his
guilt in the offense to this extent, indicated, and the exact
wording he used is a little bit in dispute, the two versions
are set forth in the petitioner's brief, indicated that he
would like to consult with an attorney.
The officer said that he couldn't make counsel
i
available to him»right then. However, he would make counsel
'

available, or at least a phone itfould be provided to him as
soon as they got to the State police headquarters.

According

to the officer, in response to a specific question from Hass,
he then said that he was not going to force Ilass to continue
with the investigation, but he would like to clear the matter

9
up.
Now, Hass8 version of the avent is that the officer
said, "I can't let you see a lawyer, but 1611 let you when we
get down to the station."

And even Hass' version of the

events does not claim that there was any greater degree of
coercion or pressure put upon him than that.
In any event, they went to the spot where the
second bicycle was recovered, and it turned out to have been
taken from another residence in the same general area at
approximately the same time.

There was no evidence in the

record indicating specifically that the bicycle had been
taken the same day except for the defendant's later testimony
to that effect.
There was an in camera hearing to determine whether
or not the police officer's testimony would be admissible
with respect to everything that the defendant Hass had said
and done at the time of this interrogation or this questioning.
After hearing the testimony the trial court ruled
that everything Hass did and said, in fact, defense counsel
conceded this, that everything Hass did and said up to the
time he inquired about the availability of counsel would be
clearly admissible, but that this inquiry

brought Miranda

into play and that nothing else would be admissible in the
State's case in chief and nothing else was admitted in the
State's case in chief.

10

Ilass then took the stand and testified that he and
two other fellows had been driving around in the general
area where the bicycles were taken, that the other two persons
had taken the bicycles without his prior knowledge and that
he didn't know exactly where they came from.
on direct examination.

This was all

In short, he admits his part in the

theft of the bicycles in the sense of receiving and concealing
the stolen property.

He conceded that he figured they were

stolen from the way his two friends brought them to him.
But he claimed that he had no prior knowledge of the crime
and he therefore wasn't guilty of the burglary with which he
was charged.

And this is particularly significant in Oregon,

or it was particularly significant, still is, actually,
because Oregon some months before the trial in this case,
adopted a

same transaction tdst of determining when

jeopardy attaches.

And it is very probable under the

teachings of that particular case, which was State v. Brown,
again cited in the brief, that had the jury believed Hass'
testimony and acquitted him of the burglary charge, double
jeopardy as interpreted by the Supreme Court of Oregon,
construing the Oregon constitution, would have barred a
second trial for the theft of which he then admitted his
guilt.
In rebuttal to Hass' testimony after the case of
Harris v. New York was called to the trial court's attention,

11

the State recalled the State police officer who testified
that after he had obtained the admissions from Hass that he
had previously testified to. Ilass had taken him around to the
residential area where the bicycles were taken and that Hass
had pointed out the precise locations of the two houses from
which those bicycles had been taken.
The court then instructed the jury that this testimony
was to be received only for impeachment purposes and then on
surrebuttal Hass went ahead to deny that he had pointed out
the houses in question.
There is very little I can sav about this case
because basically when we get to the legal issues presented,
it seems to me that it comes so clearly within the parameters
of Harris that it’s almost pointless to draw the distinctions
that the Oregon Supreme Court did.
In the first place, here, as before, we have, as in
Harris, we have the defendant affirmatively stating on direct
examination testimony when he knows that the State is not
going to be able to present contrary testimony, at least in
its case in chief and wasn't able to do it.

They knew that

this testimony existed and they knew it had been ruled
inadmissible.

It seems that this presents in this kind of

context — I'm not necessarily saying that it happened here —
that we have a marvelous opportunity for criminal defendants
to tailor their testimony in accordance to account for anything

12
they may have said prior to the time they may have asked for
counsel under the circumstances of this case.
There is no contention, as I have mentioned before,
that Hass' statements or what he did was in fact coerced or
involuntary or that any pressure was put on him.

This, we

standards of

voluntariness and trustworthiness which would render the
statements he made and the things he did after he inquired
about the availability of counsel admissible, at least for
impeachment purposes.
As I have noted in a footnote, it seems to be an
open question yet, at least this Court hasn't directly spoken
on the issue, of whether advice of rights which tells an
accused that counsel will be made available to him at a
later time, such as when and if you go to court is one example,
makes the statements inadmissible in the case in chief.

We

are not contesting this because the argument wasn't raised
below, and I don't feel that I am entitled to make the
contention here that the statements Hass did were admissible

in the case in chief# nor do I need to.

But it certainly seems

to me that this kind of a statement should be admissible for
impeachment purposes under the facts of this case#
particularly where# as again here# the jury was carefully
instructed that the statements were limited to impeachment
and were hot to be considered in determining the guilt or
ty A... ■

innocence of Hass per se.

Was that prior opinion in Brewton --

that was 1967, wasn't it?

The reason I ask is that this partly was

a situation that arose before Miranda.

Well, it says at page 29, whether or not

Miranda is binding upon Oregon courts with reference to
trials concluded before the Miranda decision was published.
MR. DENNEY:

That's whether or not, in either event.
Yes.
They apply what they did in Brewton as

Let me expand on that a little, Mr.

The Oregon Supreme Court prior to Johnson v.

New Jersey, this Court8s decision, had —

MR. DENNEY:

That was the same day as Miranda.
A week later.
A week later, right.
Well, perhaps they weren't aware of it

because the Oregon, courts had held that — are holding, Oregon
holding in State v.

Ne^Ly, which was kind of an anticipation

of Miranda, decided post-Escobelo and pre-Miranda, was retro­
active to a greater degree than this Court subsequently held
Miranda to be retroactive.

And I think this language is

getting at that problem because —

Well, if this was decided in "67, but

what date in '67?
MR. DENNEY:
QUESTION:

The exact date ■—
In relation to the date we decided

Johnson.
MR. DENNEY:

I'm afraid I don’t know, but Johnson

was in '66.
QUESTION:
MR. DENNEY:
that Neely

June '66 Miranda and Johnson was, both.
But the Oregon rule was, as I recall it,

and subsequently until we had a case somewhat later,

even Miranda would apply retroactively to cases which were not
terminated, concluded, and that included a 90-day period after
a final judgment of the Oregon Supreme Court within which the
defendant or the other side could petition for certiorari.

15
QUESTION;

The reason I ask this, in the present

case it would appear at page 15 that your court decided this
case — you can read it, I suggest, this way — jointly on
Brewton and Harris.
MR. DENNEY;
QUESTION;

Yes.
But Brewton was contrary to Harris and

they followed Brewton.
MR. DENNEY;

Is that what they did?
Yes.

Well, they distinguished also

between —
QUESTION:

Yes, they did later.

But if it can be

read as based on the State ground, even if it's also based on
a Federal ground, and even though it’s erroneous in its
interpretation of the Federal ground, I guess we have no
jurisdiction to review it, if it’s based jointly on the State
and Federal ground, do we?
MR. DENNEY;
QUESTION;

That would be true, but my position is -Yes, but don't we have to decide then

whether the recent Brev/ton v/as decided on the State or Federal
grounds?
MR. DENNEY;

Yes, I suppose that's part of the

decision you will have to undertake.

I think when you read the

Brewton opinion, as no doubt you have, but when you —

Yes..

As I say, I think it turns into

what the Oregon Supreme Court had done with regard to its
retroactivity rules about the application of Miranda and

I think the opinion as a whole in Brewton clearly is

an attempt to predict what the Supreme Court of the United
States will do
QUESTION:

Well, certainly all that discussion at

29 and 30 is in relation to developing law under the 14th
amendment as this Court had developed it.
MR. DENNEY:

Yes.

But they are again also applying

the Nealy

case

is not clear.
QUESTION:

What was the middle ground in Tate.

It gives a good deal of attention, Tate v.

United States.
Don't waste time on it.
MR. DENNEY:

I don't recall it offhand.

The distinction that the Oregon Supreme
Court drew between this case and Harris is one we submit is
not one that calls for a different result.

In either event,

Whether the police are to be faulted for not advising a man
of his constitutional rights properly in the first place or
whether they continue to question him to some degree at least
with as tentative a request for counsel as we are confronted
with here —

17
QUESTION? May I interrupt you once again?
In Brex^ton Justice Perry dissented, and the next to
the last paragraph on page 33, "I know of no reason why this
Court should go beyond the requirements of the Supreme Court
of the United States in announcing a rule," and so forth.
MR. DENNEY:
QUESTION;

Yes.
Doesn't that suggest that at least he

read the majority opinion in Brewton as going beyond any
decision of this Court?
MR. DENNEY:

Well, it very probably does, but I

submit that thinking that he's going beyond the requirements
of this Court's previous decision does not necessarily indicate
at all that the case is predicated on State grounds rather than
Federal.
I return to my basic position that I think the
Brewton case is more of an attempt to predict what this Court
would do with the Federal question than an attempt to predicate
something separately on State grounds.
QUESTION:

He relied on the Walder case much as

the court did in Harris.
MR. DENNEY;

Yes, he did.

And I found it rather

strange —I was not very frequently before the Supreme Court
of Oregon at the time -— that the majority opinion doesn’t
even talk about Walder.
QUESTION;

Is that the judge who is now a Federal

13

Circuit Judge?
MR. DENNEY:

Yes, it is.

Unless there are no further questions, I will
reserve the balance of my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Denney.

Mr. McKeen.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAM A. McKEEN ON
BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. McKEEN:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

counsel for the State has indicated, and some of

the Justices questioned him to the point that if this case
was

decided on State grounds, that the Supreme Court of the

United States would have no jurisdiction, and counsel said
that the case wouldn't be here.
It's my understanding that this Court has also
expressed a doctrine that when a State has within its
governmental framework the mechanics to cure any problem
themselves, that the Supreme Court of the United States will
hot interfere in determining how they should interpret
constitutional provisions.
In this case the State of Oregon has a constitution
tnat includes very similar words to the United States
Constitution.

They will have the opportunity if it comes

before them in appropriate case to decide whether to overrule
Brewton or to decide whether to follow the Federal rule as

19
set out in Harris v. New York.

But in this case whether

their interpretation was correct or incorrect, it was still
an interpretation that's more restrictive to the prosecution
than that of the Supreme Court of the United States»

And this

Court has said many, many times that in such a situation, the
States are free to adopt their own rules,
QUESTION:

Haven't we added certain qualification

to that, if they placo it on their own law?
MR. McKEEN:, Well —
QUESTION:

Their own constitution or statutes

presumably?
MR. McKEEN:

My reading of the cases, I didn't

believe that until Green

v. California, your Honor, but it

appears to me that as long as the State's interpretation,
even of the Federal constitutional provision was more restrictive, then there is no constitutional question before this
Court o
QUESTION:

Why do you suppose we sent some of those

cases back to the State Supreme Court to ask them to make it
clear wnether they were acting under the Federal or under
their State Constitution, if that's not the case?
MR. McKEEN:

Well, I wasn't aware of that, your

Honor„
I was aware of your concurring opinion in Green v.
California which I thought you put there for the very purpose

20

of showing that the States are free to adopt their own rules
and that the State of California could very well, when you
sent the case back, could very well resolve it the same way,
and we are trying to tell them not to,so long as they didn't
misinterpret the Federal Constitution.
In that case, Green v. California, the California
legislature had passed a law that was constitutional and the
California legislature was recognized by this Court as being
a proper party to legislate for California and the California
Supreme Court erroneously held the statute to be unconstitu­
tional under Federal law.

So this put a Federal restriction

on the State of California, and that isn't the case in Hass,
In the Green case there was a restriction put on the legislature
to pass this particular law.

This Court removed that

restriction by holding that the law was not unconstitutional.
But in that case the State had a proper standing before the
Court because they have the right to legislate in the area of
criminal law.
The case that is before the Court here, the State
of Oregon v. Iiass, how do we get by the opinion that this
Court, or the statement this Court made, in Florida v. Mellon
cited in my brief?

This Court can have no right to pronounce

an abstract opinion upon the constitutionality of a State law.
Such law must be brought into actually threatened operation
upon rights

properly falling under judicial cognizance.

21

Cooper v. California;, "Our holding does not affect
the State's power to impose higher standards on search and
seizures.”

Ker v. California—
QUESTION:

Are you intending for anything more than

that the Supreme Court of Oregon,, or the Oregon legislature,
has a right under State law or State constitutional lav; to
impose more rigorous requirements on the prosecution than is
imposed by the Federal Constitution ?
MR. McKEEN:

Yes, your Honor, that is exactly what

I attemrsted to say in my brief.
QUESTION:

But are you saying anything more than that?

What I am — in order to evaluate your point, do we
look to the Supreme Court of Oregon opinions and see whether
they appear to be based on the Federal Constitution or on the
Oregon constitution as well?
MR. McKEEN:

Well, I wouldn’t think that it would

really make any difference.

It would appear to me that as

long as the State has within its framework the mechanics to
make the opinion that they made, then this Court would have no
real purpose in examining those opinions unless there was a
federally protected right violated or a Federal constitutional
question raised.
QUESTION:
this:

Mr. McKeen, are you saying something like

Are you familiar with the differences among us d£ this

Court on the question of the constitutionality of obscenity

22

laws?

There are members of this Court who think that no

obscenity law is constitutional,, that it violates the- first
amendment.

Others think there may be within certain limits

constitutionality of obscenity laws.
; ,

Nov;, suppose you had a prosecution under ^lie obscenity

laws and there were a conviction and it was within the scope
of tiie principles this Court has stated

that

are permissible

to a State, but your Supreme Court were to say, "I don't
agree with the majority of the Supreme Court.

We agree with

Mr. Justice Douglas that no obscenity law is constitutional,"
under the Federal Constitution, and were to reverse the
conviction on that ground.
be conclusive

Are you suggesting that that would

on the State of Oregon because that was the

holding of your Supreme Court?

It interpreted the Federal

Cohstitution as it thought it ought to be rather than the
way this Court had?
MR. McKEEN:

It would still appear to me, your

Honor, to be an academic opinion of this Court if the Supreme
Court of Oregon chose to violate no one's constitutional rights
and still make a finding different from this Court.

It's

my understanding that the two courts are parallel to each
other, that this isn’t a court that stands above a State
Supreme Court with respect to
QUESTION:

..

opinion.

That they may interpret the Federal

Constitution more restrictively, it can't interpret more

23

expansively than the Court does, but may interpret more
restrictively.
MR. McKEEN:

That was my understanding.

Honor, the Supreme Court of Oregon said that.

And, your

The Supreme

Court of Oregon said in the Florance case that is cited in
both briefs that if we choose,we can continue to imply this
interpretation.

We can do so by interpreting Article 1,

Section 9, of the Oregon constitution,prohibition of
unreasonable search and seizure, to being more restrictive than
the fourth amendment —
QUESTION:

There is no question about that.

That

wasn't my question, though.
MR. McKEEN:

I understand, your Honor, but in the

next sentence was your question.

Or we can interpret the

fourth amendment more restrictively than interpreted by the
United States Supreme Court.
QUESTION:
MR. McKEEN;

I see.
Now, that was said by a justice of the

Supreme Court of the State of Oregon.
QUESTION:
MR. McKEEN:

I see.
It would appear to me, and there are

some cases that are cited where this Court has said that we
are not here concerned if an act is unconstitutional or if the
Constitution has been violated; we are concerned only if the
proper party brings the proper matter before this Court.

This

24
isn't a forum where the Court should give opinions that
?

will lay persons interpreting the law unless the parties
before it are properly before the Court»
QUESTION:

I notice that neither you nor your friend

have said that the Krivda case., K-r-i-v-d-a — are you
fhmiliar on it?
MR. McKEEN:
QUESTION:

No, your Honor.
That is I think perhaps the most recent

case V7hich we sent back — that was California, wasn't it? —
to the California Supreme Court and said please tell us whether
ybu are deciding this case under the Federal Constitution or
under your own.

There have been several of those.

If they

decided it under their own constitution, that's the end of the
case.

That's their responsibility and authority.

If they

decided it under the Federal Constitution, it's ours.

That's

the burdening of the Krivda case.
MR. McKEEN:

Well, the Oregon Supreme Court from the

text of their opinion in the Hass case recognizes the
importance of following the interpretation of the Federal
court.

But they still have within the framework of the

judicial system in Oregon the power or the means to resolve
tills question without interfering with the Federal Constitution
And therefore, under the abstention doctrine that this Court
has stated, it would appear to me that this Court should have
no real interest in which way the State of Oregon chooses to go

25

I understand that there have been statements made by
the Court that I am not familiar with that are opposed to my
opinion, but that was my opinion.
QUESTION?

Would you have the same view if the

police officer was sued for invading someone's constitutional
rights and awarded damages made against him based on the
Supreme Court of Oregon's holding and he said, Well, that may
be the opinion of the Supreme Court of Oregon, but the
Supreme Court of the United States says that I didn't violate
somebody's constitutional rights.

Do you thine he ought to

pay the damages based on the Oregon constitution?
MR. McKEEN:

Then there would be a violation of that

police officer's federally constituted
QUESTION:

rights.

Well, the Supreme Court o£ Oregon says

that he's at fault, the Supreme Court of the United States
says he isn't.
MR. McKEEN:

But in any areas, your lonor, where

a State Supreme Court is less restrictive,

I am certainly

not contending that the Supreme Court of the United States
doesn't have jurisdiction.
QUESTION:
MR. McKEEN:

I understand,
But with the police officer, if he's

required to pay damages when his act was proper under the
Federal Constitution, then I would think that he's properly
before this Court

QUESTIONS

The Supreme Court of Oregon says it isn't

proper under the Federal Constitution.

The Supreme Court of

the United States says it is.
MR. McKEEN:

X would think in that case he should

have access to this Court.
QUESTION:

There's a long line of cases that this

Court has taken where there has been an appeal by the State
from a judgment of a State supreme court saying that the
State couldn’t impose a tax on a potential taxpayer either
for due process or for commerce clauses.

I would think that

would cut against your reasoning here.
MR. McKEEN:

That the State can appeal if it

affects their property interest the same as any person, they
have standing before this Court.
QUESTION:

But does the State have property interests

under the Constitution?

Does it have any greater interest

in collecting revenue than in enforcing a criminal law?
MR. McKEEN:

Well, I believe the distinction that has

been made by the Supreme Court of the United States is just
that, that the State is a proper party when the suit involved
its property, its land, or a situation, say, when the Federal
Government wants to put a Federal park within a State.

of Oregon has no interest in it.

The State

They are there to follow

whatever the law of the Supreme Court of Oregon is, not to
claim any interest in what it is, and enforce the law as it is.
QUESTION:

What you are suggesting is at least in

criminal prosecutions, while the Supreme Court of Oregon
can't narrow constitutional guarantees of the opinions as we
interpret them, it can extend them.
MR. McKEEN:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
What you are suggesting, I gather, and

the extensions do not have to be based upon the State
constitution.

They can be based on the Oregon Supreme Court

reading of the Federal Constitution, is that it?
I4R. McKEEN:

I would think so.

Of course, I have

the feeling that I am not completely right on that, but that's
my understanding.
QUESTION:

Well, you have some authorities cited.

I don't know much about them.

Your brief would suggest that,

I gather.
MR. McKEEN:

Well, Cooper v. California says

now, Cooper v. California was a search where the State had a
statute also and the Supreme Court considered the case only
as to whether or not the search was reasonable under the
Federal Constitution.

And they said the State is free, if it

28

chooses to do so, without review by us, to apply its own
State's harmless

...

rule to such errors of State law, there

being no Federal constitutional error here, there is no need
for us to determine this matter.
QUESTION:

Your response about reading the Constitution,

the Federal Constitution, more expansively than it's read up
here Would bring you right up against the proposition Mr.
Justice White suggested to you, that if that reading then
imposed a liability on a police officer for damages for
violating the fourth amendment or any other provision in a
way that we did not countenance, then you did say that the
officer would have a claim that this rights under the Federal
Constitution had been violated because he regarded, had been
taught to regard the United States Constitution as the
supreme law of the land.
MR. FcKEEN:

Well, that still, your Honor, is the

way I think it would be. If I can follow the thread of the
fact situation correctly, the officer is a citizen of the
United States and under the Federal Constitution, he would
have a right to have done what he did and therefore his
constitutional rights have been violated by the damages and
he should have proper standing before this Court.
QUESTION:
is that

Of course, the other side of the argument

the Oregon Supreme Court hasn't expanded the

constitutional protection at all, that it's wholly consistent

29

with Miranda.

How about the merits of this question?

Do you

say that it is true, indeed, that the Oregon Supreme Court
made a decision that was outside the bounds of our cases?
MR. McKEEN:

Absolutely not, your Hcnor.

What I

attempted to say v/as that it wouldn't make any difference,
that the Supreme Court of Oregon interpreted their
QUESTION:

I know you said it didn't make any

difference, but what if you lose on that?

What if we are

sitting here and have proper authority to review the Oregon
Supreme Court's decision?
MR. McKEEN:

What about it then?

Well, it’s my feeling that through

trying the case and through the record that has been submitted
to the Court, the difference is clear between Harris and Hass
because the Harris case was an unintentional negligence
failure to say some magic words, and that's all it was.

The

Hass case, the defendant was fully advised of his rights, the
police officer knew he was advised of his rights and knew he
had the right to a lawyer, he asked for a lawyer, and the
police officer at that point in time chose to continue the
investigation and caused this boy to incriminate himself and
point out bicycles and point out a house that the bicycles had
been stolen from.

And so at that point in time this police

officer knew that he had nothing to lose by purposely violating
that boy's constitutional rights, your Honor, because if he
didn't, he wouldn't get anything, and if he gave him a lawyer,

30

any lawyer—-any lawyer—would have told that boy to quit
incriminating himself.

So the police officer knows it’s all

or nothing, I can go ahead and violate his constitutional
rights, take a chance of getting the statement in, or at least
use it for impeachment purposes, and that's better than
stopping the investigation.

So they have affirmatively —

and that's what the Supreme Court of Oregon has sale., that's
what it based its difference on, and the difference is there.
The restriction against police for purposely and
knowingly violating a person's constitutional rights in face
of the knowledge of this Court's requirements is a different
set of facts than an unintentional failure to say the few
words that are necessary.

And the Harris case said that also.

The Harris case said statements otherwise trustworthy.

Some

of tlie cases that have not followed the Harris case have
used backward reasoning.

There is a case where the

Supreme Court has held that because the prior statement was
given at a preliminary hearing that Harris didn't apply, but
actually if the statement was given at a preliminary hearing,
then it would be more trustworthy than one given to a police
officer.

So States refuse to follow there based upon reasons

that aren't really related to anything eKcept the reasons do
not follow Harris.
QUESTION:

Are you referring to any State cases

since Harris in which they sought review here, the States sought

31

review here?

Or did the State just acquiesce?

MR. MeKEEN:

1 am not sure if that was — this was

one of the cases cited in the appellant’s brief as authority

,

for the States that had followed and hadn't followed Harris but
I am not sure if that was appealed to this Court.
QUESTION:

Do you have the name of the particular

case in mind?
MR. McKEEN:

I just don't.

I believe that that is

Commonwealth v. Horner,. 453 Pa. 435, 309 A. 2d 552, a 1973
case.
QUESTION:

But there is no indication in the citation

that certiorari was sought and denied, is there?
MR. McKEEN:

No.

But the reason that they didn't

follow Harris —
QUESTION:

Well, I'm not sure, but I think the

Pennsylvania Supreme Court is one supreme court that has gone
rather far in saying that it's adopting a State law in certain
decisions of this Court.

I have some recollection that Horner

is one of them.
Incidentally, I think you opened your argument by
suggesting that the 1967 Brewton should be read in any event
as a decision of State law, or did I understand you correctly?
MR. McKEEN:

Your Honor, it is an opinion of the

State Supreme Court of Oregon —
QUESTINO:

I know, but is it to be read as rested on

32
State law and Federal law, or which?
MR. McKEEN:

I don't know.

I thought that I had a

copy of Brewton, and it has been some time since I have read
it.
QUESTION;

Well, it's attached to the petition, the

full opinion is attached to the petition, page 38, and so forth.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Denney, do you have

anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF

THOMAS H. DENNEY ON BEHALF

OF PETITIONER
MR. DENNEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court, yes, two very brief points.
First of all, with regard to the issue of whether
this is decided on State or Federal grounds, I think, and I
don't want to take a great deal of time with the basic
proposition, it makes all the difference in the world whether
this case is predicated on State or Federal grounds.
Counsel mentioned in his argument the case of
State v. Florance which we cited in our brief in a footnote
to point out that the Oregon Supreme Court does think itself
entitled to interpret Federal questions more restrictively
than this Court does.

This is the sentence which Mr. McICeen

just mentioned in his oral argument, at the end of it, "We
can interpret the fourth amendment more restrictively than
interpreted by the United States Supreme Court."

33
QUESTION:
MR» DENNEY:
QUESTION:
MR. DENNEY:

You agree to that.
Yes, we certainly do„
What is your distinction?
Footnote 12, page 9, of the petition,

your Honor, I am quoting from State v. Florance.

It was just

decided about a month after this case, your Honor.
1202.

It's 527 P.2d

I didn't have the full citation at the time I wrote that

brief, though I do have it in the files.
QUESTION:
MR. DENNEY:

Was that a search and seizure?
Yes, it was a search and seizure issue.

The Oregon Supreme Court decided to follow this
Court's interpretation of the fourth amendment as enunciated
in U.S. v. Robinson , your Honor, so it is kind of dictura.
They were saying, well, in the full context of the opinion,
tiie opinion runs something to the effect that the Robinson
opinion somewhat surprises us, we had thought the law was a
little more restrictive.

If we choose,we can continue to

apply a more restrictive interpretation of the law, either by
interpreting the Oregon constitution provision on search and
seizure or by interpreting the fourth amendment more restric­
tively.
QUESTION:
MR. DENNEY:
QUESTION:
MR. DENNEY:

You agree on the first,
Certainly we agree on idle first.
But not on the second.
No.

And the mere fact that the court

34

in this ca3e indicates that they think they are free to do it,

I think sheds some light on what they are doing in this case,
QUESTION:

I thought the court in this case

expressly put aside this whole issue, it didn't make any
difference what this rule was, that this was just a different
case, completely different case, and that they didn't have to
interpret — they certainly didn't concede here they were
interpreting the Federal Constitution more restrictively than
this Court,
MR, DENNEY:

It seems to me, your Honor, that the

very fact that they have to distinguish the Harris case is
some indication that they —
QUESTION:

It is an indication that they were

deciding it on the basis of

Federal law, that's ifhat you

were going to say,
MR. DENNEY:

That was my point, yes, in addition

to the other factors ~
QUESTION:

They may be wrong, but they are not

claiming in this case that they have a right to be wrong.
MR. DENNEY:

Not expressly.

My point is that

implicitly they think they do.
QUESTION:

Well, but if they felt an obligation, as

you just said, to distinguish the Harris case, the
implication would be in this case they thought they didn't,
they didn't feel free to disregard Harris, in other words.

35
MRo DENNEY:
QUESTIONS

Yes, that is correct.
They felt an obligation to distinguish

Harris.
MR. DENNEY:
QUESTION:

That is why I am saying —
Which would lead to the inference they

felt themselves not free to interpret the Federal Constitution
in a different way from its interpretation by this Court.
Do you see what I mean?

Or else they wouldn’t have felt any

obligation to distinguish Harris, they could have just said,
We —
MR. DENNEY:

On the contrary, because Plarris is a

ruling that is favorable.

I suppose the argument can be made

either way. But the fact is that the Harris decision cuts
against the Oregon Supreme Court’s decision in this case.
The distinction that they have to draw is to say on its facts
this isn't Harris,and therefore they are still interpreting
the Federal Constitution is the position I am taking.
Turning to the merits of the issue just briefly,
there was one other point that came up in counsel's argument
for the respondent.

The Harris case does not pause to

consider whether the police officer's failure to advise the
man in toto of his constitutional rights was inadvertent or
whether it was unintentional, or whether it was intentional.
Similarly, we think that the kind of question that goes on
here, asking the defendant to continue the investigation even

36

if this could be construed as an intentional violation of
constitutional rights and on the facts of this case we don't
think it rises to that level, we still think that the policy
enunciated in Harris is applicable to this case simply because
in either situation, as the Court held, the prophylactic
purpose of Miranda is sufficiently served by keeping the
statements subsequently obtained out of the case-in-chief but
keeping it available to prevent perjury, possible out and- out
perjury when the defendant takes the stand and keeping it
available for impeachment purposes.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 1:48 p.m., oral arguments in the
above-entitled matter were concluded.)
