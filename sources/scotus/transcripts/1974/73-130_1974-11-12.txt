PRO CE E D I N G S
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

next in No. 73-130, Ellis against Dyson.
Mr. Neuborne, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BURT NEUBORNE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. NEUBORNE:
the Court.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

My name is Burt Neuborne.

I represent the

petitioners herein, Tom Ellis, a white college student at
Eastfield College in Dallas, Texas, and Robert Love, a black
graduate student at the Southern Methodist University School
of Music.
Petitioners were arrested at 2 a.m. on January 18,
1972, under a Dallas loitering ordinance while driving in
Tom Ellis' car in a suburb of Dallas.

At the time of the

arrest the petitioners were attempting to determine which of
several possible apartments that Mr. Love had looked at
during the day would be most appropriate for Mr. Love to rent.
Apart from their mere presence in an automobile at 2 o'clock
in the morning in Dallas, Texas, there ware no signs of
criminal activity, and obviously petitioners' arrest and the
vague and overbroad Dallas ordinance upon which it

was

based raise serious constitutional questions under this Court's
decision in Papachristou v„ Jacksonville.

4
Petitioners initially sought to raise the
constitutional question pcsed by the Dallas ordinance in the
Texas State courts.

They first brought an application for

discretionary Writ of Prohibition in the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals on February 14# 1972# and that application for
discretionary writ was based on the facial unconstitutionality
of the Dallas loitering ordinance.
QUESTION:

And the purpose of that application was

to prevent their being tried at all; was that it?
MR. WEUEORNE:

The purpose was to provide the Texas

courts with an opportunity to pass on the constitutional
question.
QUESTION:

Yes, this is pretrial.

MR, NEUBQRNE;
QUESTION:

Pretrial, yes, sir.

And what they asked for was that they

not be tried at all because the statute or the ordinance was
unconstitutional.
MR, NEUBORNE:

Was facially unconstitutional, yes,

sir.
QUESTION:

What was the form of the charge?

MR, NEUBORNE:

The charge, I believe, was an

information for loitering under the Dallas ordinance.
The description of the arrest and the officer's description
of the arrest are set forth in the appendix in the handwriting
of the officers and is before the Court.

5

QUESTIONS

Mr. Neuborne, are the petitioners here

still living in Dallas?
MR. NEUBORNE;

Your Honor, we have been unable to

ascertain at the present time the whereabouts of the
petitioners.

We have made preliminary attempts to trace them

through their parents, and those preliminary attempts have
thus far been unsuccessful,

although X must represent to the

Court that the attempts have been preliminary.

We suggest

to the Court that under any circumstances, whatever resolution
of the issues posed by this appeal, that on remand to the
district court, just as in Steffe 1 v. Tho.mpson, the passage
of three years renders it imperative that additional facts be
taken by the district court to determine whether or not a
current case of controversy exists, for two reasons;
I frankly have no information concerning the
current enforcement pattern of the Dallas ordinance, nor have
I sufficient information to discuss with the Court the current
status of the petitioners with respect to the ordinance.

Of

course, the arrest and conviction records remain, and that
would, I take it, be unaffected by their present whereabouts.
QUESTION;

But if they are not living there, the

case certainly is moot as to any possible future arrest.
MR, NEUBORNE;

I would think that is correct,

X

would think on remand, under the disposition that we think
the preferred disposition of this case, would be a vacation of

6

the orders blow and a reconsideration in light of Steffel ?.
Thompson with a suggestion to the district court that they
undertake the same type of investigation that this Court
suggested the Georgia district court take in Steffel v. Thomp­
son.
After presenting the discretionary Writ of
Prohibition to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and having
it denied on February 21, petitioners then brought a motion
at trial, a pretrial motion, in the Dallas Municipal Court,
the Corporation Court of Dallas, in which they attacked the
facial unconstitutionality of the statute.
QUESTION;

Would it be entirely unreasonable to

suggest that you are lawyers without clients at the moment?
MR. NEUBORNE;

I think not, sir.

I think there is

a —
QUESTION:

You don’t know where they are,

you

don't know whether they live in Dallas, and you don't know
whether they have disposed of this litigation.
MR. NEUBORNE:

Your Honor, the contact which the

Southern Methodist University Law Clinic had with the clients,
the last contact, which would be a year ago, indicated that
they wished to continue with the litigation, especially as it
affects their arrest and conviction record.

I suggest to the

Court that at least as the arrest and conviction records of
these young people, both of whom were college students and who

7
would be severely adverse3.y prejudiced in their later lives
by a conviction record such as this, that there is at least
a live controversy and an obligation upon the attorneys to
continue to try to clear the records of these individuals in
this situation.
When the motion was dismissed in the Dallas Municipal
Court, the motion attacking the facial unconstitutionalitv of
the statute, petitioners’ counsel in the Municipal Court
then faced a critical procedural decision, a procedural
decision which, your Honors, we suggest, shaped the subsequent
course of this litigation.

Petitioners’ counsel at that point

after the pretrial motion had been dismissed, had two courses
of action open to him.

First, he could have followed the more

traditional course which would have bean to press the
unconstitutionality of the Dallas ordinance through the Texas
courts.

That course of action had three serious disabilities:
First, the Texas courts maintain a two-tier: system

of justice similar to the two-tier

system of justice which

this Court sustained in Colten v. Kentucky two years ago, so
that the price of pressing the petitioners' clams through the
Texas court system was the risk of a substantially increased
sentence upon presentation in a trial de novo in the County
Court.

Indeed, it would have turned out that the potential

risk would have been a 20-fold increase in the fine.
But secondly, and I think even more importantly, in

8
terns of the lawyer trying to do a good job for his client
back in. 1972» the procedural issue which counsel for the
petitioners faced in the Dallas court was the problem of issue
preclusion

if he continued to voluntarily present the

constitutionality of the Dallas ordinance to the Texas State
courtst. On a theory of issue preclusion» election of remedies»
or res judicata» or some other type of theory» he might have
indeed at that point» were he to continue to go to the merits
and to reach a determination on the merits in the Dallas
Municipal Court» he might have been barred from litigating
the issue further in the Federal courts at some subsequent
point.
And that is precisely» your Honors» what happened to
counsel in This t le th/ a 1 te v. Mew York» which v/as reported at
497 F.2d 339, where they followed the more traditional route
and went up through the State court system challenging a park
permit regulation on which there was only a $5 fine and for
which» of course» habeas corpus would probably not lie in a
subsequent proceeding» aixd when they had exhausted all their
State judicial remedias and sought to raise the constitutionality
of the New York City park permit statute as applied to
prospective distributions of leaflets -QUESTION:

Why aren't you barred by the judgment of

the Municipal Court?
MR. NEUBORNE;

Yes, sir» I was coming to that.

The

9

choice that petitioners' counsel made at that point was to
exercise an element of the — offer a compromise, which your
Honor mentioned in Colten v. Kentucky, as a significant aspect
of the two-tier

system.

What petitioners’ cotinsel did at

that point was offer to plead nolo contendere, which under
Texas law has no collateral or res judicata effect, disposes
of the —
QUESTION:

It may not, but you only did that after

you lost the motion to dismiss.
HE. NEUBORNE:

Yes; there was a pretrial motion to

dismiss, your Honor.
QUESTION

There was a final ruling on that motion.

MR. NEUBORNE:
QUESTION:

By a Texas court.

MR. NEUBORNE:
QUESTION:

There was a ruling on the motion to —

Yes.

Why doesn't that preclude your —

MR. NEUBORNE:

Your Honor, we suggest that the

final judgment x?ould not have attached until the Texas court
reached the full merits of the determination as to guilt or
innocence.

In other words, there was an initial preliminary

motion to dismiss.
QUESTION:

Once that motion —
Do you know whether under these circumstances

a Texas court would have held you barred by this judgment
from, filing a civil suit, declaratory judgment suit, in the
Texas court?

10
MR„ NEUBORME:

My understanding, sir, is that the

entry of a nolo contendere plea under Texas law -- and I am
not an expert on Texas lav/ — my understanding of Texas law
is that we would have not been barred.

As a matter of fact,,

that is precisely the reason for the offer of a nolo contendere
QUESTION:

Maybe not barred by nolo

contendere,

but barred by the Court's decision on your motion to dismiss
in which you presented the constitutional issue and it was
finally resolved.
MR. NEUBORNE:

The whole purpose of presenting

the constitutional issue in Texas court was to provide them
with the option, if they wished, to reach the issues, and if
they chose not to reach the issues, to at least permit the
petitioners to reserve their Federal rights for litigation
at some future point.

And that, as I understand it, was

counsel's purpose in proceeding by nolo contendere under
these circumstances.

We believe, your Honor, under any

circumstances, even without the nolo plea, that there would
have been no res judicata preclusion here, and, of course, —
QUESTION:

Why not?

MR. NEUBORNE:

We think that there are five possible

reasons why res judicata should not apply:
First, the considerations of nolo.
But, second, the considerations which your Honor
?

adverted to in the dissent from certiorari in Mack, and that

XI
is that when 1983 actions are concerned, there is at least a
question as to whether or not res judicata should be applied
with its full vigor to such a determination, especially where
here it is being used as the functional equivalent in some
part of the role which is played by Federal habeas corpus in
granting ultimate Federal review in issues of criminal
jurisprudence raising constitutional questions.
Third, we believe that the existence of the Texas
two-tier system which would have forced petitioners to risk
a 20-fold increase in their sentence as the price of appealing
from any adverse decision in the Texas Municipal Court cuts
very heavily against precluding the petitioners from seeking
remedy in Federal court.

While Texas, under this Court's

decision in Colten v. Kentucky, may condition access to the
Texas courts undergoing a trial de novo with the possibility
of an. increased sentence, we suggest it's a far cry from that
to condition access to the Federal courts under the Civil
Rights Act of 1871 on the same requirement that you risk a
substantially more severe sentence as the price for exercising
the choice of forum rights which Congress determined to give
to civil rights litigants.
QUESTION:
in Texas.

You have me worried about nolo contendere

If you plead nolo contendere, you are then found

guilty, are you not?
MR. NEU30RNE:

Yes, sir, you are.

12
QUESTION?

And then can be sent to prison, right?

MR. NEUBORNE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

You say it doesn’t have any effect.

MR. NEUBORNE;

Sir, what I meant was that it

doesn't have any collateral effect.

It doesn’t have any

res judicata effect on subsequent proceedings in Texas.

It

is not an admission of guilt, for example, in a subsequent
civic proceeding.
QUESTION;

Is it different from a guilty plea?

MR. NEUBORNE:
guilty plea.

Yes, sir, very different from a

A guilty plea is —

QUESTION;

Give me a Texas case.

MR. NEUBQRNE:

Your Honor, I think Texas follows

the traditional rule that would be followed in a Federal
court.

For example, if there is an —
QUESTION:

You think.

MR. NEUBQRNE;
QUESTION:

If there is an anti-trust —

You think.

MR. NEUBORNE*

That is my understanding of the

Texas lav;.
QUESTION;

Well, you have shown me one there.

MR. NEUBORNE;

Well, your Honor, if I could read

you the Texas statute, which my colleague has pointed out ~~
QUESTION;

That’s all I am asking.

MR. NEUBORNE:

Sorry.

1 should have gotten to it

13
much sooner.
The legal effect — this is Texas Code of Criminal
Procedure Annotated, Article 2702, subsection 6, 1965.

The

legal effect of such plea — referring to a nolo contendere
plea — shall be the same as that of a plea of guilty, but
the plea may not be used against the defendant as an admission
in any civil suit based upon or growing out of the act upon
which the criminal prosecution is based.
QUESTION:

But that is different than saying it

doesn't have any collateral effect in the traditional sense
because, you take the Federal anti-trust judgments, and
certainly the Texes statute sounds like it's a counterpart of
them, permit the use of a criminal judgment in a rather
unusual way in a civil action if there has been a guilty plea.
And it sounds to me like all they are saying is in Texas
that a nolo plea won’t have this broad an effect.
MR. NEUBORME:

Your Honor, as I understood it —

and I think your Honor’s suggestion that the Texas statute is
the same as the Federal anti-trust practice is correct —

but

under Federal anti-trust practice, the entrance of a nolo plea
by a defendant cannot be used against him in subsequent civil
proceeding to determine that the underlying legal issues in
the initial criminal proceeding were to be resolved adversely
to him.
QUESTION:

That certainly makes sense, but it seems

14
to me that falls far short of saying that he is not bound by
the judgment entered in this case.
MR. NEUBOSSJSs

Your Honor, all petitioners — well,

perhaps 1 should clarify what petitioners seek precisely in
this case.

Petitioners are not attempting in this case to

collaterally attack the Texas judgment.
QUESTION:

But you are asking that it be expunged,

aren't you?
MR. NEUBGRNE:

Your Honor, petitioners seek three

causes of action, and because the case below was disposed of
under Becker v. Thompson, no court below found it necessary
to analyze the three causes of action separately.

But I

suggest that the separate analysis of the causes of action is
critical in a proper resolution.
Petitioners' first cause of action and their
primary cause of action is a cause of action seeking a
declaratory judgraent identical to the Steffel declaratory
judgment protecting them against the threat of future prosecu­
tion.
Petitioners' second cause of action was a determina­
tion not that the conviction be voided, but simply that Texas
be restrained in some way from disseminating records of the
conviction in the future.

In other words, the fine, the

punishment, whatever Texas did to petitioners was an appropriate
imposition of sentence under a nolo contendere plea and —

15
QUESTIONS

What is the Federal basis for that second

cause of action?
MR, NEUBORNE?

That, as far as I know, is a novel

cause of action, one which the district court never reached,
your Honor, because it felt that it could not even
entertain' the first cause of action.

I suggest on remand

that these are questions, if this Court were disposed to
remand, that these are questions which obviously must be
grappled with.
QUESTION?

Well, your first cause of action, I guess,

you said i3 moot.
MR. NEUBORNE:

No, sir.

whether it is moot on remand.

I say that we must determine

It may well be on remand that

it is moot.
QUESTION?

I thought you said that any prospective

—* this case was dead as far as any prospective significance
was concerned.

4

MR. NEUBORNE?
QUESTION?

Ho, sir.

In terms of the enforcement of the

ordinance against these petitioners.
MR. NEUBORNE:

No.

What I suggested, was that under

Steffel it V70uld be appropriate on remand to the district
court to take fresh evidence of that fact.
now three years old, your Honor.
QUESTION?

But this case is

It was filed in March

Suppose you had appealed and you had a

16
trial de novo and you had judgment entered against you in
the same way and found guilty, and then you decided that you
should go to the Federal court rather than appeal to the
Texas — go up through the Texas appellate system,
MR,NEUBORME:
QUESTIONS

Yes, sir.

Now, would you suppose the 1983 course
.

4

is open to you then?
MR. NEUBORNEs
QUESTION;

Why wouldn't it be?

MR. NEUBORNEs
QUESTION:

No, sir.

We don't suggest, your Honor —

Why wouldn’t it be?

MR. NEUBORNEs

Because of the absence of a two-tier

problem in a direct appeal situation.
QUESTION;
you?

I Itnow, but affirmatively what would bar

Res judicata or what?
MR. NEUBORNEs

Oh, I see.

I understand.

Probably

res judicata.
QUESTIONS

What about Younger?

MR, NEUBORNEs

It's not res judicata Younger v.

Harris, the notion that the criminal proceeding continues on
to the very end.
QUESTION;

But let's assume that at the time you

filed your Federal suit, the time to appeal had expired so
there was no criminal case pending.

You would still say that

Younger would bar you in the sense that you could always

17
then short-circuit Younger just by letting the appellate ~~
MR. NSUBORNEs

Your Honor# I would suggest that

then the issue would turn on what the cause of action was.

If

the cause of action were a collateral attack on the conviction
itself ~
QUESTIONS

It is.

MR. NSUBORNE:

— I think that Younger would bar us.

If the cause of action were prospective —
QUESTIONS

Either res judicata or Younger would bar

you.
MR. NEUBORNEs

In those circumstances.

But I think

the critical distinction and the distinction which I am trying
to articulate is the difference between a cause of action
which was retrospective in nature and looks backward to
attempt to impeach the judgment itself and a judgment which
is declaratory and prospective in nature under the Staffel
rule -QUESTION?

Nov;# your expun«stion argument looks

backward# doesn't it?
MR. NEUBOKNE:
afraid.

It falls between two stools# I am

I have not in my own mind —
QUESTIONS

I know# but to get rid of the record

you have to get rid of the conviction.
MR. NEUBOENEs

Sir# I think it might be possibles

to postulate an argument that said that the conviction when

10
made was proper and having pleaded nolo one cannot then go
back and attempt to directly impeach the conviction, but that
the conviction was based on an unconstitutional statute which
has subsequently been found to be unconstitutional, and that
it would be inappropriate to continue to punish the petitioners
on a daily basis by the daily dissemination of their arrest
and conviction records prospectively.

In other words, 2

think the expuncticn cause of action has some elements of a
prospective application, although I agree with the Court that
there is at least, as to the expunction aspects of the case
QUESTIONS

What good will that do these petitioners?

Assuming that if you win this case, assume it doesn’t get on
the front page of every newspaper in this country, how will
they ever* know about it?
MR. NEU30KNE:

Your Honor, first their arrest and

conviction records would be expunged and
QUESTIONS

How will they know about it?

MR. NEUBOFNE:

Well, in terms of the ordinary

and normal dissemination of the arrest and conviction records
which go on in everyday life, at least that will stop for
the petitioners.
QUESTIONs

But how will they know about it?

MR. NSU30M.Es

Your Honor, we will make every effort

to notify them personally.,
QUESTION:

And if they are alive, you might find

19
them.
MR. NEUBORNE;

Yes, sir.

We will make every effort

to find them and to notify them personally.
Your Honor, I don't —
QUESTION:

yes, sir.

When did you all last hear from the

petitioners?
MR. NEUBORNE:

Your Honor, as I understand it,

approximately a year ago.
QUESTION;

Did you as counsel hear from them, or

was this some indirect communication?
MR. NEUBORNE;

Your Honor, I am counsel in New York.

May I have a moment to check with my co-counsel on that point?
QUESTION!

Have you ever heard from them?

MR. NEUBORNE;

Have I ever personally heard from

them?
QUESTION s

Yes.

MR. NEUBORNEs
QUESTION;

No, sir.

I came into this case —

Has any counsel in this room ever heard

from them?
MLR. NEUBORNE;
QUESTIONS

Which on©?

MR. NEUBORNE;
QUESTION;

Oh, yes, sir.

Did you say in this room?

Yes.

MR, NEUBORNE;

Your Honor, counsel who has dealt

personally with them is Professor Walter Steele at Southern

20

Methodist University.
QUESTION?

Is he present?

MR. NEUBORNE:
QUESTION ?

No, sir.

Bo you know when he last heard from them?

MR. NEUBORNE:

Approximately one year ago, Mr.

Kennedy tells me.
QUESTION:

Was that in writing, or how was the

coramunication conveyed?
MR. NEUBORNE:

Professor Kennedy tells me the

original authorisation was in writing, but he doesn’t know
whether the last contact of a year ago was in writing or not.
QUESTION:

And you can’t tall this Court what they

want right now.
MR. NEUBORNE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, what they want right now.

How can you do it?

If you have never

seen them and nobody else has seen them for over a year,
MR, NEUBORNE:

What they want right now, your

Honor —
QUESTION:

How can you say it?

MR. NEUBORNE:

Well, based on the authorisation

which they gave to counsel when the case was originally
begun.
QUESTION:

People change, don’t they?

MR, NEUBORNE:

It’s possible that they don’t care

about their arrest and conviction records any more, but I

21
suggest to the Court that's not likely.
QUESTIONs

How do we know wa’ve got a case in

controversy, here?
MR. NEUBORNEs I don't knot? that you have.
QUESTIONS

You don't.

MS. NEUBORNEs

We suggested to the Court, and I

think appropriately so, that a problem with this case is that
it would be appropriate to go forward with the prospective
causes of action under generalized notions of Federal,
that there was at the time it was presented to the district
court in 1972 a live case or controversy.

Unfortunately,

the district court believing itself bound by Becker v. Thompson
failed to reach that case or controversy.
nov; passed since that occurrence.

Three years have

I would be the last parson

to suggest to the Court that the Court should blindly proceed
in the face of the passage of three years' time without
adducing fresh facts.

It was for that reason that we

suggested to this Court that the preferred disposition of this
case is a vacation of the decisions below in light of
Staffel v. Thompson and a remand to the district court for
determination as to whether or not there is anything viable
before the court.

We seek no more than that in this proceeding.

We believe that —
QUESTIONt
do that?

Don't we need a case or controversy to

22
MR. NEUBORNE:

My undorstanding is that you can

if you wish vacate a decision of the court below on the
grounds that it either has become moot or that the case or
controversy no longer exists and remand to that court below
for the taking of evidence.
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting mootness?

MR. NEUBORNE:
possibility of it, yes.
QUESTION:

I am suggesting that there is
Your Honors *—

What do you want us to do — write an

essay?
MR. NEUBORNE:

Your Honor, what we suggested that

you do is write a one"-line vacation of the district court’s
dismissal and a remand to the district court to simply
determine whether under the principles that this Court laid
out last year in Steffel v» Thompson —
QUESTION:

I thought you said it was moot.

MR. NEUBORNE:

Well, your Honor, mootness and lack

of standing in a case like this seems to come in a full
circle. If the petitioners no longer have a live case or
controversy, whether one calls it lack of standing or one
calls it mootness, that is something which ought to be
determined on remand in the district court, and we suggest
the appropriateness of that as a disposition of this matter.
We do not suggest this case is an appropriate vehicle for
major consideration of the issue.

Our primary point in our

23
brief was a suggestion that since both lower courts have
disposed of this case without analysis, properly so because
they found them barred by Becker y. Thompson from considering
the difficult question tbs case raises, that the appropriate
way to dispose of this case is to vacate those decisions,
remand to the district court, see whether there is a live
case or controversy and start all over again in the light of
post-Steffel jurisprudence.
This Court is being asked to rule on very difficult
issues on a difficult record in which there has been no analysis
by the courts below.
QUESTION:

What’s your reference to Younger?

MR. NEUBORNE:
QUESTION:

I’m sorry, sir.

Why doesn’t Younger rather than —

MR. NEUBORNEs

Younger doesn’t apply because the

pending prosecution was over a full month before the proceeding
began.

And the pending prosecution was over, your Honor,

with the consent of the State of Texas.
not be accepted under Texas lav;.

A nolo plea need

It was accepted by the judge

as a speedy way to dispose of that particular proceeding and
not to dispose of the underlying legal issues which that
proceeding raised.
I suggest to your Honor that a nolo plea under the
facts of this case is the functional equivalent in a criminal
case of an

..

reserve in a civil case in that you

24

are present involuntarily in a State forum.

You urge the

State forum, all right, you have me in the State forma, you
can convict me under a nolo plea, but X would like to reserve
my right to litigate the underlying Federal issues until some
subsequent point.
QUESTION £

Do you and fclie State agree that that is

the effect of a nolo plea in Texas ?
MR. NEUBORNE:

I have not discussed the matter with

the State, but from the statute, that was the understanding of
counsel when he offered the nolo plea, that is the under­
standing of counsel today when we present it to the Court —
QUESTION;

But it certainly didn't bar you from

appealing up through the-State system.
MR. NEUBORNE:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

Or it didn't bar you from raising your

Federal claims furtlier in the State system.
MR. NEUBORNE:

Except under those circumstances

had we done so, I feel that we would have been —
QUESTION:

I understand that, but there was no bar.

MR. NEUBORNE:

Oh, no, sir, except for the bar

that’s raised by the danger of a 20-fold increase in sentence

Your Honor, can be a substantial impediment to proceeding.
Petitioners were fined $10, and the potential maximum that
they could have received on a trial de novo was $200 fine.

QUESTION:

But they could have relitigated these

issues in the higher court, could they not?
MR. NEUB.QRNE s

No question about it, your Honor.

No question about it.
QUESTION;

Returning to questions of Mr. Justice

liar shall a few minutes ago, you had a petition*

for certiorari

filed in this Court nearly a year and a half ago and during
that year-and-a-half period we don't know whether there is a
case or controversy still here.

The whole machinery of the

Court has been involved in dealing with this case which we
are not sure, and you. can't assure us, is a case.
MR. NEUBORNE:

Your Honor, when we learned of the

problems in locating the petitioners, that's when we for the
first time in our brief on the merits suggested to the Court
the appropriateness of a remand in this case and not a plenary
consideration on the merits.
QUESTIONs

I suggest to you. that it's hardly the

kind of a case that ought to engage the attention of this
Court with all else it has to do to wait until the case lias
been here for a year and a half to find out whether there is
any case at ail.

I’m not scolding you personally? you are

doing your nob as counsel.

QUESTION :

I suppose your suggestion of a simple

following the Steffel procedure of determining

whether there is a live case or controversy represented
a recognition on your part

But I think the Chief Justice is absolutely correct,

we should have been more explicit as to why we were saying it.
W© thought that it came across clearly enough in the papers,

OSJii ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS H. CONNER
ON .BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. CONNER:
the Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I represent five named respondents in this present

27
litigation, Frank M. Dyson, the former Chief of Police for
the City of Dallas? N. Alex Bickley, the present City Attorney
of Dallas? Scott McDonald, former City Manager for the City
of Dallas; Hugh Jones, former Clerk of the Municipal Court?
and Wes^Wise, the present incumbent Mayor who soon is subject
to going through the election and campaign for his re-election.
The facts in this case briefly, the petitioners were
arrested on January 8, 1972, at 2 a.m.
as to their version of the facts.

I differ with counsel

that it was in an area where new homes were being constructed.
It was in the area of North Dallas residential area.

QUESTION;

What is an alais ticket?

MR. CONNER;

Sir, one of the petitioners had a

ticket which he did not dispose of.

He did not — it was

alais, he didn’t pay his fine, nor did he — he did take a
plea on the case but didn't pay his fine.

An alais ticket is one that hasn't

QUESTION:

disposed of.
t

MR. CONNER:

It’s a ticket or citation, usually a

minor misdemeanor traffic citation type matter which they
either took a plea of guilty or they just never did come in
to Municipal Court and dispose of.

In those instances, the

procedures of the Dallas Police Department is when they do
reach an individual who has an alais citation, they bring

29
them to the police station and make them post a bond to
insure their presence or at least the forfeiture of their bond.

this case that they have used diligence in the State courts.

In the respondents’ answer to the complaint, we

They did not assert any allegations of bad faith or harassment
against these respondents.

their pleadings no irreparable harm or injury.
We have also assarted and still maintain they did

I disagree.

Mr. Conner, I have one other question.

The law student who wrote the affidavit, X

Honor, but I don't think it's a practice of customarily
dismissing it when we see the eyes of an attorney.
This Court has said it'a a rare case

I say this case, sir, has been no

look at the subjective feelings and only the subjective
feelings of — one of the petitioners said, "1 have a chilling
of feeling about my first amendment rights being affected.”

The city of Dallas hasn’t been shown to go after and

just prosecute hippies or college students or any ethnic
social group or any racial minority or any distinct clas3 of
persons to which the petitioners might belong.
The law student indicated that, there are 40 to

I maintain

it's highly, highly speculative and conjectural that these

municipality, the eighth largest city in the country, with a

of a million three.

And the mere mathematic possibilities

are very remote, particularly for someone whose whereabouts
can't even be shown to be in Dallas.
The petitioners waived with the advice of counsel
their right to proceed further.

QUESTION:

The fact remains, Mr. Conner, does it

not, that the district court here dismissed this complaint
on the authority of Becker v. Thompson.
MR. CONNER:

That's correct.

34

QUESTION;

And Becker v. Thompson was explicitly

overruled by this Court in Steffel v. Thompson.

So wouldn't

it logically follow that the thing to do is remand this to the
district court to consider the case free of its misapprehension
that Becker v. Thompson is the law?
MR. CONNER:

Your Honor, I think it was decided

under the Younger doctrine primarily
of the Fifth Circuit of Younger.

and the interpretation

Steffel makes the strongest

argument as to case or controversy, the genuineness of the
threat of prosecution, and the Ailee decision also strongly
supports the position that in only cases of genuine threats of
future prosecution should this Court or any other court
entertain Federal intervention.

And I think that position is

made stronger by recent decision of this Court than ever
before.
QUESTION;

In other words, you are saying in order

to remand we have to find the case or controversy here and
now,
MR. CONNER;

Yes, and not at the time the action was

initiated, but at the time of review.
QUESTION:

Isn't your position also from your

remarks that there was not a sufficient case or controversy
at the time the district court decided this?
MR. CONNER:
QUESTION:

That is exactly my position.
That even under Steffel v. Thompson this

35

plaintiff didn’t show —
MR. CONlSERs

A case or controversy or a genuine

threat of future prosecutions sufficient to involve the inter­
vention of a Federal court.
QUESTION:

That's right.

Not only no case or

controversy, but there wasn't a sufficient allegation of a
genuine threat of future arrest or prosecution.
MR. CONNER:

And I think the Court should look in

the pattern and practices of the respondents, the government
officials involved, and see whether or not there is a genuine
threat, and there are no allegations in the complaint and no
allegations today or any time.
QUESTION;

Can I take it one of your positions is

that wholly aside from Steffel, Younger v. Harris bars this
suit in the Federal court because they failed to follow their
case up through the State system, that Younger v. Harris would
— that there had been a criminal case pending and it would
still have been pending if they had appealed their case and
presented their Federal constitutional claims in the State
courts.
MR. CONNER:

I would believe, and I do urge that

Younger v. Harris should be applicable or at least considered
in this Court's ruling.

The only thing that precludes Younger

from being considered here is that there is no pending
prosecution, and that v?as the —

36
QUESTIONi

But there was.

There was one and a con­

viction \tfhich could have been appealed.
MR. CONNER:

Right.

But the petitioners by their

own actions took the less stringent course and so
not bound by Younger because "we paid the fine.”

they are
And I think

that's rewarding the less diligent from the stringent guidelines
of Younger which I think are inappropriate and unfair to any
litigant in Federal court, and particularly one who occupied
the position of respondents.
The Court in Steffel spoke of res judicata difficul­
ties, and I think this is res judicata difficulties here.

This

for the County Court of

Appeals to reverse or change over this decision, and it would

case would be a reward or award to the nondiligent, to take
them away from the stringent

rulings of Younger v. Harris.

37
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF BURT NEUBORNE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. NEUBQRNE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Merely on the case or controversy, as we understood
it, the case or controversy perimeter which this Court had
laid down both in Steffel and earlier in Boyle v. Landry flowed
somewhat like this:

In Steffel there was a direct threat to

a direct person, and that was held to give sufficient standing.
In bong Island Vietnam Moratorium v. Cahn, which this Court
affirmed last year, there was a generalized threat by a
prosecutor to the public at large, and that was sufficient to
give standing.

In Roe y. Wade and Doe v. Bolton there was the

mere existence of the statutes themselves unaccompanied by any
specific threat, and that \*as held sufficient to give standing.
111 Epperson' v.Arkansas there was a discredited statute which
had been on the books — which had not been enforced since
1928, and® Eppersonthat was held sufficient to give standing.
We think that the petitioners, at least in January
of 1972 when the case or controversy was originally — or
March of 1972 when the case or controversy was originally
submitted to the Federal court, manifested a sufficient stake,
a sufficient fear of future arrest which was neither chimerical
or imaginary within the language of this Court in that the
only conduct which they have bean guilty of was to be guilty
of being on a Dallas street at 2 o'clock in the morning in a

38

car driving in a Dallas suburb.

They had no idea why they

were arrested, had no idea what conduct on their part
triggered the arrest.

Indeed, you had a statute sufficiently

broad that would virtually invite dragnet and suspicion arrests,
and if these people don't have standing to challenge the
statute, it would be virtually impossible to hypothesise anyone
else to whom the statute might be applied who would have
standing.

It's the very vice of the Dallas ordinance that

it's so vague, so without standards, that it's not directed
particularly at anybody, that it is a virtual grant of
untrarameled
they t^ish.

discretion to the police to make whatever arrests
Having been arrested under it once, we think that

that would have been sufficient back in 1972 to determine
whether or not there was a case or controversy, especially
given the cxirrent patterns of enforcement which the Dallas
police were engaged in.
Your Honor, we do not ask this Court to substitute
itself, or the Federal court'
appellate forum.

to substitute itself for the

The only thing that we ask in this case is

that if a jurisdiction which permits nolo contendere is
prepared to allow a criminal defendant to offer a nolo contendere
plea and to take the nolo contendere plea , that under
general principles of nolo law, that grants a benefit to the
State and it allows the State speedy dispositiori of the
particular proceeding and the imposition of sanctions.

3S
On the other hand, the person who offered the nolo
plea himself is attempting to reserve to himself the
opportunity, should it be appropriate, to mitigate the underlying
legal issues in Federal court pursuant to the choice of forum
rules granted by the Civil Rights Act of 1871«.

In fact,

in candor, the basis of our claim is that a nolo plea,if
accepted by an appropriate jurisdiction, is the functional
equivalent of a reserve under England v. Louisiana Board of
Medical Examiners and is the attempt in a criminal litigation
to reserve for a future time the opportunity to present
underlying legal questions to a Federal court.
whether to accept it lays with the State.

The option

The State is under

no obligation to accept a nolo plea, but they did so, and
under those circumstances we believe the petitioners have not
foreclosed their rights to present the underlying legal issues
at some appropriate time to a Federal court.
QUESTION;

I gather you argue anyway that

you are

under no obligation under something said in Monroe y. Pape
and Preiser v. Rodriguez to exhaust any judicial remedies —
MR. NEUBORME:

Oh, of course.

To the extent this is

appropriately a 1983 action is now, I take it,axiomatic
that there is no obligation to exhaust State judicial remedies
prior to the presentation of a constitutional issue.
QUESTION;

I gather that’s certainly been settled

as to State administrative remedies, but what about —

40

MR. NEUBORNE:
your Honor.

I think Stats judicial remedies, too,

I believe —

QUESTION:

That is suggested in Monroe v. Pape,

I gather.
MR. NEUBORNE:
QUESTION:

And Preiser v. Rodriguez.

The language in Preiser is only “If

remedy under the Civil Rights Act is available, a plaintiff
need not first seek redress in a State forum,” and then the
first case cited is Monroe v. Pape, 365, at 183 where it was
suggested that you need not exhaust —
MR. NEUBORNE:
QUESTION s

I think that's right.

With respect to the extent Younger might

make you.
MR. NEUBORNE:

Yes, sir.

And the reason that Younger

we think does not apply here, your Honor, was the nolo
contendere aspects of this case.

Texas, your Honor, had it

within its power to insist upon a merit determination.
QUESTION:

You would have a different story if they

had pleaded guilty, as far as Younger is concerned.
MR. NEUBORNE:

It would be a different issue, yes, sir

It would be a great deal more difficult.
QUESTION;

It might be different, but how would you

decide it?
MR. NEUBORNE:

Your Honor, under those circumstances,

I would want to know whether there was a two-tier system of

41
justice so that the appeal might have been impeded.

In the

absence of a two-tier system —
QUESTION:

But I think a while ago you agreed that

if you had gone to a trial de novo, presented your
constitutional claims,

had been rejected and you had been

convicted and you had appealed —
MR. NEUBOENE:
QUESTION:

We could not have used 1983.

Because of Younger.

MR. NEU50RNE:

Yes, sir.

But, your Honor, the

appeal from the —
QUESTION:

That's all I —

MR. NEUBOENE:
QUESTION:

I'm sorry, sir.

Well, I don't understand.

If you concede

that, why then are you not in the same position not having
taken a de novo appeal.
MR. NEUBORNE:

Your Honor, in a de novo appeal, the

potential maximum was 20 times greater.
QUESTION:

Why is Younger — if you could have

stopped there without going on to the State Supreme Court or
wherever you had to go under the Texas procedure before you had
exhausted all your judicial remedies, and you say that would
have barred your access to Federal court, why doesn’t it under
the circumstances you are in now ?
MR. NEUBORNE:

The difference, your Honor, is that

a trial de novo, the sentence one received in a trial de novo

42
cannot be changed on appeal except in accordance with the
strictures of Pearce v. North Carolina, so that there is no
threat of a greater sanction caused by going up through the
appellate process.

But when you go to a trial de novo, you

take the risk, in this particular cases you are taking a risk
of a 20~fold increase in sentence.

And it's that impediment

on the free exercise of the appeal that we think distinguishes
the two type3 of actions.
QUESTION;

If nolo contendere helps you out, why

couldn't you bring a 1983 action before the original trial?
MR. NEUBORNE:

Your Honor, I think that under

Younger principles —
QUESTION:

You couldn't.

MR. NEUBORNE:

The State was perfectly entitled to

impose punishment on us for that particular prosecution.
QUESTION:

But now the nolo is different, it is

someplace between a guilty plea and no trial.
MR. NEUBORNE:

Yes, sir.

And we think the difference

is that in a nolo situation, we subjected ourselves

the

State interest which Younger was designed to protect with the
capacity to prosecute a person for a particular incident.

They

revindicated that, interest in this case.
QUESTION:

You think that's a very thin line?

MR. NEUBORNE:

Your Honor, I think it's an important

line, though, because the State interest that Younger was

43
designed to protect was the ability to prosecute a particular
defendant for a particular incident.
has been vindicated here.

And that State interest

These defendants have paid the

fine, they have paid the penalty that Texas saw fit to impose
upon them.

The issue is whether or not they are going to be

foreclosed from raising the underlying legal issue at some
future time in a Federal forum, and we think that no principle
of Younger requires that.

Younger doesn't guarantee the

State courts the opportunity to pass on the underlying legal
issues.

It only guarantees the State courts the capacity to

complete a pending prosecution.

And they have done so

successfully in this case.
Thank you, your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:38 a.m., the oral argument in
the above-entitled matter was concluded.)
