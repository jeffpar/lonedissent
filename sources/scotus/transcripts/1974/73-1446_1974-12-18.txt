ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARVIN M. KARPATKIN, ESQ.f
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. KARPATKIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and. may it

please the Court:
•»

The critical question in this case is whether the
First Amendment's prohibition against prior restraint is
violated by the grant of a preliminary injunction against
the distribution of a scientific book, a psychotherapeutic
case history, where the only finding which has been made by
any judge, concerning disguise of foe patients, is that the
defendant doctor took reasonable steps to meet the usual
standards for disguising the patient's identity.
The injunction has been in effect since May 7th of
1973, more than 17 months —
QUESTION:

Is that conceded, that the usual steps

were taken?
MR. KARPATKIN:

It is conceded that that is what

was held by the Justice presiding at Special Term, New York
County, Mr. Justice Silverman, and it's sat forth at page
A83 in the record, Mr. Justice Blackmun.
QUESTION: Where, in the Appendix do we fine that, or

4
is it there?
MR, KARPATKIN: The words appear at A83, Mr. Chief
Justice.

A83 in the Appendix, and if I way read:
"Defendants have taken some steps to disguise

the identity of the patients.,

I think those steps reasonably

meet the standards for such disguising of the patients *
identities."
That is the only finding which ha3 been made con­
cerning disguise, and then the Court engages in this bit of
speculation as to who might be able to penetrate the disguise.
The Court says, "While I have not read this one
thousand-page book, the examples of possible identification
given by plaintiff in the moving affidavit must be assumed
to bs the more striking ones.

I do not think that they would

rea-ly identify plaintiff as the patient to someone who did not
already knew that plaintiff was the patient."
Necessarily subsumed into this primary question of
the prior restraint is the connective question of what are
the constitutional limits of any cause of action which would
seek tc impose liability on a doctor for publication of a case
history, inasmuch a3 there can be no provisional remedy,
equitable or otherwise, in the absence of a constitutionally
sufficient cause of action, this second question is, of
necessity, subsumed in the first.
While the constitutionality of a prior restraint on

5
publication is hardly a novel question for this Court.
Its attempted imposition in this case f on a cencadedly
truthful, non~ofosoane, scientific book, in fact a book-length
case history of a course of psychotherapeutic treatment, which
is more than ten years over, is most decidedly a case of first
impression.
The book in question has more than 1,000 pages,
1716 footnotes. The list price is $20.
order was for 3,COO.

The original print

In the three months that it was on

sale prior to the injunction, approximately 200 copies were
sold.
The subject of the book is the treatment of a man
and wife, both diagnosed as schizophrenic, without, drug or
shock therapy.

The form is a transcription of approximately

one-fifth of the psychiatrist's session notes, with copious
footnotes written by the. psychiatrist.
The therapy is more than ten years completed. It
was commenced in 1956, 18 years ago, and terminated in 1963,
eleven years ago.
The book was published in February of 1973.
Defendants are a psychiatrist, her husband a late
therapist, and a small publishing house.

The plaintiff is

a former patient.
The other individual subject of the book is the
patient's former husband, now deceased, but divorced from

6

plaintiff prior to his demise,
Hi3 widow, who is also claimed by plaintiff to be
identifiable in the book, did not join plaintiff in this
action.
A preliminary injunction was granted at Supreme
Court, New York County, Special Term, without a trial, or an
evidentiary hearing of any kind? indeed, under the New York
Civil Practice Law and Rules, there is no mandatory right to
someone facing an injunction t.c have a testimonial hearing,
much less a full trial on the merits.
QUESTION:

Is that on the preliminary, or on the

permanent, too?
MR. KARPATKIN:

On the — a permanent injunction,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I presume is an injunction after a trial,
and -there are all the rights which would normally take place
on the trial.
QUESTION:

But a preliminary you can hear just on

affidavits?
MR.KARPATKIN:

That is correct, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, and that is tvhat happened in this case, and that,
indeed, is the usual practice in New York.

It is unusual,

but it happens occasionally, for a Justice at Special Term
to order a testimonial hearing.
And there is no absolute right to it, and we cite a
case in our brief which indicates that it's within the

7
discretion of the Justice.
The Justice moreover states in his opinion that he
has not even read the book.

What’s more, he made the following

observations, findings and statements, which seem
incomprehensibly inconsistent with his conclusion? namely,
that it is a well-established practice in the medical
profession and in the public interest for a physician to
publish case histories.
Dr, Freud.

This being a tradition started by

Indeed, the only citation of authority in the

opinion at Special Term is the citation to Dr. Freud.
Also an observation that the scientific value of
the book is not a fit subject for judicial evaluation.

Also

the statement that defendants have taken steps to disguise,
which I read to the Court in response to the Chief Justice's
question.
And with respect to the many examples, 34 in number,
of claimed identification given by plaintiff in her moving
affidavit, there was not a sentence of oral testimony or
cross-examination on that.

The Court found:

"I do not think

they would really identify plaintiff as the patient to someone
who did not already know that plaintiff was the patient."
I respectfully submit, that by the use of this
double negative, the special Term Justice eliminated any
possible finding of general identifiability, and he found an
impossibility of identifiability, limited to an obviously

8

small and discreet number of persons who met all of the.
following requirements:
These must be persons who know the plaintiff, and
who know of the existence of the doctor, and who know — now,
mind you, in 1973 and 1974 ■— that plaintiff and the doctor
had a doctor-patient relationship that ended more than ten
years ago.
And even there Justice Silverman merely speculated,
that those might be the only ones, or the only ones who might
be able to know 'would be persons who would be within that
discreet, group.
I submit that the Justice at Special Term and the
Appellate Division, which affirmed the Justice at Special Term,
and the Court of Appeals had an ample basis in the record for
finding that normal standards of disguise for a case history
publication were met, inasmuch as plaintiffs were given false
first names.

Plaintiffs were given no last names, no location

was indicated.
The patient's family group was radically altered,
fictionalized, so as to make it appear that they had only
one child, when in fact they had two children.
The book wa3 not published until tan years post­
treatment, and after the divorce and the death of the husband.
Arid all that plaintiff was able to produce in the
three months between the publication and the injunction to

9
support her claim of identiflability was a single affidavit
of a friend, which does not refer to even a single one of
the 34 allegedly identifying characteristics which plaintiff
herself identified in her moving affidavit.
QUESTIONi

These factual representations that

you're making, Mr.Karpatkin, are you thereby implying that
if there had been identification this book couldn't have —
the publication of this book could have been enjoined?
MR. KARPATKIN;
QUESTIONS

No court has ever so held, —

Well, what's your submission?

MR. KARPATKIN;

— Mr. Justice Stewart.

My submission is that if there would be a complete
and total identification, such as, for

example, if the

identifying information in the Kinsey Institute of sex
Research files were suddenly to be made public, I would
concede that with appropriate safeguards for hearing and
testimony and cross-examination to ascertain the truth of
those allegations, that injunctive relief would be permissible
and a prior restraint would be permissible.
QUESTION;

Or, let's say, you got the idea of

writing a book, "The Secrets of My Clients", and wrote it
up and had it printed, could that, the publication of such a
book be enjoined — if you identified all your clients and
disclosed all their — the confidences they had reposed in
you?

10

MR. KAHPATKINs

If there was a sufficient identifica­

tion in breach of a professional attorney-client relationship,
where in fact that identification had been established and
where in fact there was not consent, I would have to answer
in the affirmative to your question, Mr. Justice Stewart;
but I would assume —
QUESTION:

And nothing in the Constitution at least

would grant the injunction of the publication of such a book?
MR. KARPATKIN;
QUESTION:

We do —

My hypothetical book.

MR. KARPATKIN:

Yes, sir.

We do not maintain, Mr.

Justice Stewart, —•
QUESTION:

That's not to say that the plaintiff would

have any constitutional right to have the book enjoined, but
that would be up to the State, wouldn’t it?
MR. KARPATKIN:

It would be up to the State, Your

Honor, but .it. would be subject to any cause, any underlying
cause of action being subject to constitutional limitations
which would not impermissibly entrench on First Amendment
guarantees.
QUESTION: Well, my hypothetical case of these
authors actually disclosing, concededly disclosing the
identity and thereby violating the confidences of their
patients or, in the alternative hypothetical case, you the
author of a book, "The Secrets of the Clients of a Lat^yar's

11
Lifetime", you would concede that there's nothing in the
Constitution that would prevent a State from enjoining the
publication of such a book, if the State chose to do so,
would you?
MR. KARPATKIN:

I would say that it would have to

meet all of the standards which —
QUESTION: Well, would that meet them?

What are

the standards?
MR. KARPATKIN:

The procedural standards, Mr.

Justice Stex'/art, which this Court has said must be met before
a prior restraint.
QUESTION:

Well, let's say, after a full hearing,

this was found.
MR. KAFPATKIN:

I would agree xi/ith Your Honor's

hypothetical suggestion that it would be within the power of
the Stato to —
QUESTION:

I thought the command of the First

Amendment was in terms absolute.
MR. KARPATKIN:

The command of the First Amendment,

Mr. Justice Douglas, is in terras absolute.
QUESTION: So you’re talking about a wate re d - dow n
version of it, that it's been adopted by a Constitutional
Convention assembled here today *—
QUESTION:" Of course the First Amendment directs
itself to Congress, and we're not dealing, if we’re taking .it

12

literally, we’re not dealing here with, anything that Congress
has done.
MR. KARPATKIN s

For purposes of my argument , fir.

Justice Douglas and Mr. Justice Stewart, I must take the First
Amendment as it comes to me in decisions of this Court,
beginning with Near v, Minnesota„
QUESTIONS

Well, since the Court can make it

applicable to the States.
MR. KARPATKIN:

Again I would have to say that in

Near v, Minnesota, this Court set down the absolute
proscription against prior restraints, pointed out the nature
of prior restraint in violation of the First Amendment, and
indicated the absolutely limited and demarcated conditions and
circumstances •under which exceptions could be permitted.
Exceptions being permitted, perhaps, in the field of obscenity,
perhaps in the area of national security, even though this
Court declined to allow prior restraint in the New York Times;
Pentagon Papers case, notwithstanding allegations of national
security issues being at stake.
QUESTION;

Mr. Karpatkin, is there any rule of

New York practice that would have prevented you or the
respondents, for that matter, while you were appealing the
preliminary injunction up through the New York Appellate
system, from asking the case to come on for hearing on the
final injunction before the Supreme Court?

13

MR. KARPATKIN:

No, there is no such rule, and,

indeed, the Justice at Special Term and the Appellate Division
indicated that either party or both parties could apply for
a preference of the trial.
QUESTION; Well, why didn't you do that, if you were
concerned

about getting the book on the streets, so to

speak?
MR. KARPATKIN:

Because of the unique circumstances

of this case, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, were such that it was
counsel's view, representing the defendants in this case,
that a trial in the face of a preliminary injunction and
without adequate pretrial discovery of a plaintiff who makes
allegations that she’s identified throughout the 1,000-page
book, and can be recognized by persons going back to her
earliest childhood — and there are such allegations which
are made — that to undertake a trial of that kind, it would
not have been proper and expeditious to do unless there had
been adequate and complete pretrial discovery.
QUESTION; Can't you get pretrial discovery in
connection with an injunction action in New York?
MR. KARPATKINs

I would assume that the answer to

that would have to bs yes, but that would have to be under
the direction of the — that would have to be under the
direction of the Justice to whom the application for a
preliminary injunction was made.

14
QUESTION:

And you think he wouldn’t have granted

it in this case?
MR. KARPATKIN;

Again I would have to speculate.

Butt obviously, there was a great push on the part of my
learned adversaries for the quickest possible decision by the
Justice at Special Term.
QUESTION: Well, I can see their point of view,
they've got what they want, they’ve got a restraining order;
but I would think from your point of view, if you want to get
rid of the thing as expeditiously as possible, at least one
tiling you would consider is having the tiling come out in the
same court that granted the preliminary.
MR. KARPATKIN;

After having read the preliminary

injunction, the — what I might say wild?, respect to the Justice
at Special Terra, the baseless preliminary injunction and
opinion supporting it, and the opinion of the Appellate
Division, it was our view that the wisest course to follow
would be to seek reversal of the preliminary injunction by
courts in the Appellate system.
It was our view that there was a prior restraint
on publication in effect, and we just had to find a court with
power to dissolve it.
QUESTION:

In that connection, I take it what you’re

saying would satisfy any requirement of finality for an appeal
here?

15
MR. KARPATKIN:

I think that's clear, Mr. Justice

Blackman, under decisions of this Court, and I think that this
Court has held that a decision of a State court, even though
nominally interlocutory, is final for purposes of Section
1257, if it concerns an important question of national
policy. And I believe that's precisely what this Court held
in the Keith case, and it’s difficult to conceive of any
more important national policy, I respectfully submit, than
that which is so frequently rearticulated by this Court,
that there is a presumptive invalidity to a prior restraint
on expression.
QUESTION:

Would you think the time factor works

in relation to the Keith case?

As I recall it, in the Keith

case, the temporary injunction had been in effect for about
three years, and here it’s a little over one year.
MR. KARPATKIN:

I would say yes, Your Honor; it's

a year and five months.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR, KARPATKIN:

Well, I suppose I would have to

stand by the First Amendment and take the view that even a
day of a prior restraint is an assault, which has to be
justified.
QUESTION:

Well, the thing is whether there's a —

the same question that Mr. Justice Rehnquisfc was addressing
to you, whether you have a final judgment?in the Keith case,

16
I think the Court took some pains to say, or indicate that
the temporary injunction having continued for three years,
it was reasonable to assume that that was quite permanent,
MR. KARPATKIN:

I think it is equally reasonable to

assume, Mr. Chief Justice, in the light of the opinion at
Special Term, the unanimous decision of trie Appellate Division,
the unanimous decision of the Court of Appeals, that it would
be most unlikely for any court, other than this Court, to
have dissolved the injunction before the case had gone its
way.
QUESTION:

May I pertain for a moment to Mr. Justice

Stewart's question or questions:

let's assume for the moment

that, your clients — or that the patient's identity had been
disclosed clearly, unequivocally, in this book; would you be
here today in that situation?
MR. KARPATKIN:

1 do not think I would be here

today, to answer your question, Mr. Justice Powell.
QUESTION;

In other words, the basis of your case

here is that, as a matter of fact, the patient's identity was
not revealed in this book?
MR. KARPATKIN*

Well, I respectfully submit that

my argument does more than that.

It is not just that as a

matter of fact, but it's that as a matter of law a prior
restraint, preliminary injunction cannot be entered on the
basis of a record which is as deficient as tills record is.

17
And that any underlying cause of action, whatever
it is, and I doubt if anyone can read the melange of opinions
from Special Term and from the Appellate Division and
ascertain what the cause of action was supposed to be? but
that there has to be an articulated cause of action.
There has to be an indication of harm to the patient from
identification? there has to be findings of disguise —
findings of insufficiency of disguise and of identification,
and tiie judge has to say so in his opinion.
And it seems to me that some of the things that
this Court said in the case of Mayo v. Canning, about which
there was some discussion in the argument which preceded mine,
even though the Court of course was dealing —
QUESTION:

But that’s under the rule -— that's under

the Federal Rules of Civil procedure, where we're administer­
ing a very explicit system of rules over courts over which
we have supervisory authority? but we don’t have supervisory
authority over the New York Court system.
MR. KARPATKIN: That is of course correct, Mr.
Justice Rehnquist.

But I think it is possible to at least

see some due process gloss, or some notions of due process
gloss, at least in some of the words that Mr. Justice
Roberts, in Mayo v. Canning Company, and I believe that he
talks about the statements of fact are mingled with arguments
and inferences for which we find no sufficient basis, either

in the affidavits or in the oral testimony.

In our case, of

course, there was no oral testimony»
And such findings as there are, if they can be
called findings, run. in petitioners’ favor.
But it seems to me that there is a suggestion in that
opinion that this intermingling of arguments and inferences,
and this absence of elucidated statements of fact, is precisely
what makes difficult, if not impossible, the course of
appellate review.
And therefore, I think it1s possible to read from
that case in due process clause as to the views of this Court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Karpatkin, in response to Mr.

Justice Stewart, you indicated that in the attorney's example
he gave that the State would have power to enter such an
injunction, would that — was that answer based on the breach
of !ihe confidential relationship that was inherent in Mr.
Justice Stewart's question, or was it the nature of the
disclosures that would be involved?

Wholly aside from whether

they were a breach of any confidential relationship.
MR. KARRATKINs

I don't wish to evade an answer to

your question, Mr. Justice White, but all that I can say is
that learned amicus, representing the American Psychiatric
Association and two other organisations, have postulated five
different possible theories of liability, and said that it's
unclear which of them, or which combination of them would be

19

involved.
QUESTION;

Well, you gave ~™ you answered Mr,

Justice Stewart* however* I wondered -what your basis was.
MR. KARPATKIN:

I would suppose that it would be

possible for a State court to formulate a standard of
liability based on the breach of the confidential
relationship between a. professional person and someone coming
to see the professional person.
Assuming that all of the standards have been met*
and that all of the procedural necessities have been met.
QUESTION:

Well* the State might assert a variety

of interests* but it may be the same interest expressed a
variety of ways, one might be a breach of a confidential
relationship, another way of perhaps putting the same thing is
the violation of an implied contract, another way might be
of saying if the State law is so protective of this confidential
relationship that it will not allow a physician or a lawyer
to testify even in a court of law, where the whole purpose is
to get at the truth, certainly that interest is strong enough
to prevent anybody, for his own profit, violating the same
secrets and hawking them around in the bookstores of the
State.
And there might be others.

There might be just a

regulation of the professions, as such, either the medical
profession or the legal profession, the ethics of the pro™

2Q
fession.

.And a variety of other State interests.

None of

these is a constitutional interest.
The constitutional question is on the other side of
the coin:

can a State * even with a full disclosure , in -the

interest of furthering of these objectives, prevent in
advance the publication of a book that would amount to full
disclosure of these confidences?
MR. KARP ATKIN:

Well, I submit that those are the

issues which are in the case.
QUESTION:

But the State interest, it's not for us

to say what ground the State might have put its interest on,
that’s not a constitutional questioxi.

The question is, Does

the Constitution permit the State from enjoining the
publication?
MR. KARPATKIN:

My adversary has suggested in his

brief, I don’t —
QUESTION:

Prevent the State.

MR. KARPATKIN:

~ that there might be a

constitutional right of privacy which xvould justify an action
by the wife here.
QUESTION:

Well, none was asserted here in this

cause of action, was it?

It’s a State cause of action under

the State tort laws, isn’t it?
MR. KARPATKIN:

But as — that is the way the cause

of action is phrased, Mr. Justice Stewart.

21
QUESTION:

That’s what I thought.

MR. KARPATKIN;

But to indicate -the difficulties

in attempting to comprehend what happened in the State courts
in New York, the decision which is cited by the Appellate
Division is this Court’s decision in the abortion cases,
in suggesting that there is a merging constitutional right
of privacy.
How that can be read into this case is beyond me,
but there it is.
QUESTION:

I suppose it's a little early to expect

that you’ve read Mr, Justice Stewart’s opinion in the case
that came down this morning, or perhaps you did —
[Laughter.]
MR. KARPATKIN;
QUESTION:

I was able to glance at it.

You read that during lunch hour.

Well, that — was that something like this kind of a case,
do you think, or not?

A tort, a claim for violation of

privacy that sounds in tort.
MR. KARPATKIN:

The Cantrell case, fir. Chief

Justice, turns on the — on one of the recognized sub­
divisions , which has been established in the State lav/ of
many States, and I believe appears in the restatement, of
the false light notion of a cause of action for privacy
violation.
And it seems to me that all that the decision of

22

this Court says, and I hope X have not left anything out in
my brief reading, is that the law is still 'the law as it
was handed down by this Court in Time v% Hill, and nothing which
may have been said or may have been intimated, or which
anyone may seek to try to derive from the decision by this
Court in the Serta case, changes the lav? in Time v. Hill.
QUESTION:

Well, it said we don’t evert have to

consider that question, because in this case the Court followed
Time v. Hill.
MR. KARPATKIN3
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, and we —

You read it essentially correctly? I

didn’t moan to be correcting you.
MR. KARPATKIN:

Thank you.

[Laughter.]
MR. KARPATKIN:

And we urge that the standard of

Time v. Hill, which is the only occasion when this Court
posited a standard of liability in the case of a confrontation
between an alleged violation of right of privacy and the First
Amendment, is the only standard which is applicable here.
QUESTION: Well, your case is stronger, too, isn't
it, because here you were enjoined, and in Cantrell it was just
an action for damages, and in Time v. Hill it was an action
for damages.
MR. KARPATKIN:

Yes, of course.

' that the case is stronger; but -—

But I do — I do

QUESTION:

But don’t: overlook the dissent in the

Cantrell case.
MR, KARPATKIN;

I have not overlooked it, Mr.

Justice Douglas.
[Laughter.3
MR. KARPATKIN:

I never overlook, any of the

dissents written by any of the members of this Court.
But, as I said before, in answer to the Chief
Justice's question, that — perhaps Mr. Justice Stewart's
question — that a lawyer arguing before the bar of this
Court has to take the First Amendment as it5 s come down from
decisions of this Court, and that is exactly how we urge this
Court should treat this case.
And under the decisions of this Court, from Near
to date, this is clearly an impermissible prior restraint,
and any acts of semantics or overlooking or exceptional!zations, which have been attempted, either by my learned
adversary or in the decisions of the 'Tew York courts, simply
will not wash, when compared against the clear writing of
Chief Justice Hughes in Near v. Minnesota and in decisions
since then.
With the Court's permission, I'll save the
remainder of my time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
Mr. London.

Very well.

24
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EPHRAIM S. LONDON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. LONDON:

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This doesn't involve a simple case of a publication
of a case history that is being enjoined.

What we have in

this case is a patient's confidences, divulged to her
psychiatrist, copied almost verbatim* notes made during each
session, psychiatric session between the psychiatrist and her
patient, who is the respondent in this case, and the patient's
husband.
In those notes, xvritten cut at length after the
sessions,, and then made into a book and, as I understand
from the brief of the amicus in this case, or the amici,
the Psychiatric Associations, in these sessions a patient is
encouraged to dredge up from the unconscious thoughts that
would never be expressed ordinarily, memories that have been
too distressing to keep in mind and the like.

And all

these were written down, ware ©voiced by the psychiatrist's
questions, were then written down and then published, and
they relate to such matters as the patient's thoughts during
intercourse, her husband's masturbation, her own masturbation,
her fantasies about incest and the like.
All this then published in a book and retailed in
discount houses, department stores, trade book stores, even

25
music stores.
This is the kind of book, and this is the problem
we have here today.
history.

And -this is again just not a case

I can't imagine a situation in which there has been

a greater assault on a person's dignity, on a person’s self
respect, to have these thoughts set out for one's neighbors,
for one's children, for one's students to read, because the
patient here is an assistant professor in a university.
She is herself a psychotherapist.

One can imagine what

would happen if this got into the hands of her pupils or
her ovm patients or her own children, or her own friends.
QUESTIONS

Do you disagree v?ith that, or challenge

that figure of 3,000 volumes, copies of the book having been
published?
MR. LONDON:

I don't know, Your Honor.

This, I

think, i3 a statement made by the psychiatrist here —
QUESTIONs

Well, isn't that in the record?

MR. LONDON:
QUESTION:

Pardon me?
Isn't that in die record?

MR. LONDON:

Those are statements made which we

haven’t verified as yet.
And I am going to come to this question of the
status of the case, and why we are so little advanced, and
why a year and a half had passed since the preliminary
injunction was granted.

26

Not/,, the first preliminary injunction in this
case was an injunction which prohibited the sale ohlyiin the
trade stores and the d partment stores and the discount houses,,
but allowed sale in medical schools, in libraries that dealt
with scientific books and the like.
ivnd as soon as that injunction was issued, the
limited injunction was issued, we, representing the patient,
wrote a letter to the court saying we would like an immediate
trial, and we suggest that the court allow ten days for pretrial

examination, pretrial discovery, before the full

trial starts.

And-we received no response.

That letter is at A91 of the record.
We received no response.

The order or the injunction,

the limited injunction was slightly modified and the case
was assigned to a judge for all purposes including trial.
And we wrote ‘that judge, and we said:

May i\?e have an

immediate trial?
Then the attorney for the psychiatrist wrote back
and said:

We don't join in that application.

As a matter of

fact, we probably will appeal, and this is a very complicated
case, and we want a long pretrial examination.
Now, of course, the appeals were taken, so that it
would have been difficult to have a trial.

I think the State

could have been secured without any difficulty.

I think

Your Honor, Mr. Justice Stewart, asked that question before,

27
and I — a stay would be issued on appeal, a stay of the
trial if the question of the right to injunction were
challenged.
QUESTION: Well, under New York law, did the trial
court not lose jurisdiction as soon as an appeal was filed?
MR. LONDON:

Well, it retained jurisdiction of the

case, Your Honor.
QUESTION: Well, but —
MR. LONDON:
QUESTION:

But — but —
— but it would lose jurisdiction in

the sense of being able to do any tiling about it, without
leave of the Appellate Court.
MR, LONDON:

I think it would have been necessary

to apply to the Appellate Court for a stay, but those stays
are automatically grantedr as indeed they should be if
there's a real question to be determined.
But now corning back to this procedure here.

As I

said, when the case was assigned to a second — to a judge
for trial and for all other purposes, we again asked for the
immediate trial, and we again had the opposition of the
psychiatrist here.
And they said they had a long pretrial examination,
and, indeed, it took — occupied a long period of time, because
it was completed only last week.

Exactly one week ago.

And we got it completed only by applying to the court to

compel the completion of the examination.
But only the parts of six days — I’m now quoting
from the psychiatrist’s brief, reply brief — only the parts
of six days were taken over this year and a half for that
examination before trial»
So that any delay or duration of this preliminary
injunction is entirely the fault of the psychiatrist here,
and indeed over the opposition of the patient, who wanted a
quick trial and disposition of this case.
Now, Mr. Karpatkin stated, in answer to a question of
Mr. Justice Stewart, that if -there were identification of
the patient in this book, an injunction could issue after trial.
And I think that that virtually disposes of the case.
May I first tell you factually what the identifica­
tion in the book is?
Tlie book does give fictitious names to the parties
and says they are fictitious.

But then goes on to give a

great many details of the lives of these people, indicates
that idie patient’s husband was a professional speech writer, —
QUESTION:

Mr. London, why are you making this

argument?
MR. LONDON:

I want to show that there's a factual

base for identification, because Mr. Karpatkin says if there
is identification, then there's an end to the matter.
QUESTION;

Well, what do we do with this — I don’t

29

know — how do you characterize this statement of the
Special Term, where the judge says?

'“I think these steps

reasonably meet the usual standards for such disguising of
patients’ identities”?
MR, LONDON:

Mr. Karpatkin failed to indicate that

that was modified.
QUESTION: Well now, —
MR. LONDON:

By the Appellate Division, and is

no longer a holding that —
QUESTION:

do you think it was modified by the

statement which characterized the publisher’s acts as an
attempt to disguise their identity?
MR. LONDON: Well now, what it says is that the
claimed justification for publication —
QUESTION:
MR. LONDON:

Yes?
-— the attempt to disguise her identity,

does not provide a sufficiently —
QUESTION: Well, that may be so, but do you think
that is an Appellate Division's rejection of this factual —
MR. LONDON:

I think so, but I think we can go a

great deal further, Your Honor, and say that as a matter of
law —
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but you're not — you're

not — on that basis this just becomes a fact-bound case
that may not —

30

MR. LONDON;
QUESTION;

Certainly not,.
—interest a lot of people.

I’m

suggesting — I just — are you suggesting — let vis assume
for the moment that we accept che finding of the Special
Term.

I guess that’s the finding, that this meets the usual

standards for disguising identity,.
MR. LONDON;

May I say, Your Honor, that, as I

understand the law, you should not» And may I ex pand on that
for just a moment, or does Your Honor have some otherquest ion?
QUESTIONs

No, no, you go ahead.

But you might,

get back to telling rue, at some point, what if we do accept
that finding in the Special Term? what happens to your case,
if anything?
MR. LONDON;

Well, I still think we have a cause

of action, Your Honor.

I think we have a cause of action

based ■—
QUESTION; Well, so did both of the lower courts.
MR. LONDON;

Yes, Your Honor.

There was unquestionably a violation of a statute,
and, as Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out, an implied contract
between the parties„
QUESTION:

Mr. London, I asked Mr. Karpatkin the

question that you’ve just referred to, whether or not he
conceded that if, after full due process procedures, there

31

were a finding that this book did identify your client and
did disclose and publicize the confidences reposed by your
client in the defendant authors of the book, could New York
constitutionally enjoin the publication of the book; and I
understood him to say yes, it could,.
Now, may I ask you the opposite questioni

If, after

a due process hearing, it was determined that there was no
identification of your client in this book, do you think
New York could constitutionally enjoin its publication?
MR. LONDON;

Yes, Your Honor, I think New York —

QUESTIONS On what basis?
MR. LONDON %

-— could.

On two bases.

One basis is there has been a violation of the
statute, giving rise to a cause of action without identificat

tion. The law is very clear and says the doctor may not
disclose —
QUESTION;

Well, I'm — I was —

MR. LONDON;

— .it doesn't say !,and identify" in

the court’s disclosure.
QUESTION;

Well, disclosure implies identification,

doesn't it?
MR. LONDON;

No, no, I don't think so, Your Honor.

I think that the cause of action exists, and I think that the
cause of action exists just by the publication, because the
patient, has been injured by that publication.

32

QUESTION; Wall, that wasn't, my question»

My

question wasn’t whether or not a cause of action might exist
under the statute or coinmon law of New York, but whether or
not if such a cause of action could constitutionally exist
if there were no identification whatsoever of your client?
MR. LONDONs

Again, the answer, I believe, is yes.

QUESTION; And the answer isn’t that New York gives
this cause of action, because the question is not — does not
have to do with the law of New York, it has to do with the
Constitution of the United States.
MR. LONDON;

As I understand the First Amendment,

it applies to speech, but where conduct is prohibited by a
lawful statute, the mere fact that that conduct is brigaded
with communication, that it is that conduct comes into affect
through communication, doesn’t prevent — the First
Amendment does not prevent, in such a situation, the inter­
ference with the communication«

The communication may be

interfered with because the interference is essentially with
conduct, and the mere fact that it is, the conduct is —
QUESTION ; Well, here the conduct is writing and
publishing a book.

Is that conduct?

If it is conduct, then

the —
MR. LONDON;
QUESTION;
MR. LONDON:

Yes, it can be.
— First Amendment is meaningless.
The conduct is the disclosure of the

33

patient's secrets, the betrayal of the patient's confidence.
That is the conduct, Your Honor.

And it is accomplished

through —
QUESTION;
MR. LONDONs

Well, I began with a hypothetical —
— the book..

It would be conduct

if it was expressed orally, and it doesn’t become sacred,
because it is a book.
QUESTIONS

My hypothetical case was one in which

there was no violation of any confidences, because there
xtfas no disclosure.
Now, if I told you that somebody once told me the
following confidential story, and I won't tell you who it was,
or when it was, I’m not violating anybody's confidences, ara
I?

MR. LONDON:

I would think so, Your Honor, if you

were told not to disclose that story.

If you had promised

not to tell that story ever.
But may I say that we have a case here in which
the question of identification does not exist because, as a
matter of law, the patient was identified in this book.
QUESTION:

You're saying that the effect of the

act of publishing this book — or I'll put it as a question:
Are you saying that the act of publishing this book i*as the
same as taking all of these notes and files and putting them
in the public library where everybody could look at them?

34
MR, LONDON:

Certainly, if our Honor,

QUESTION: That’s your thesis, that it’s oond.nct
not utterance?
MR. LONDON;

Yes, Your Honor.

Except giving it

wider publicity than it might receive if it were merely put
into the library.
But may I return to this question
QUESTION:

If you're right, then, this means that

there can be no publications of this nature by any psychiatric
authors —
MR. LONDON:

Of this particular nature, I think not,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

By any psychiatric author?

MR, LONDON:

Not without the agreement of the

patient.
QUESTION:

That Freud himself could not have

published what he did publish, because he did his very level
best to obliterate any identification or identity.

This

means that New York State, had it wanted to, back in the
era when Freud was writing, could have enjoined the publica­
tion of everything he wrote?
MR. LONDON?

Not at all, Your Honor.

I quoted —

QUESTION: Then I misunderstood you.
MR. LONDON:

I quoted Mr, — I’ve quoted Dr. Freud,

to the affect that no matter what happened, one must not do

35
anything to betray the patient, and that that — if one is
faced with the necessity of not publishing or of betraying
the patient, one does not publish.
But again, there is a statute here, and may I speak
a little of New York practice?

The New York Court of

Appeals is a court of very limited jurisdiction, and the
Constitution of the State of New York provides -that the
Court of Appeals may not pass on questions of fact.
That, by the way, .is set out at page la in the appendix.
The Court of Appeals may not review any question of
fact at all, unless the Appellate Division, in an inter­
locutory judgment, finds new facts or, in its order granting
leave to appeal new facts are set forth,
Nov;, I think almost every petitioner in that court
knows that rule, and in point — or should know the rule,
ana then there is another statute, so that the Court of
Appeals may pass upon questions of law in the context of a
particular case and in the context of facts.

There is a

statute, 5612, which is again in the Appendix, which
provides that if there are not new findings of fact in the
opinion of the court, or in its order, or in the order
granting leave to appeal, then the Court of Appeals must
assume that those facts were determined in favor of the party
who is respondent, who is the patient here.
Unquestionably there is a disputed fact here, or at

36

least there is disagreement with respect to whether there is
identification.
QUESTION: Well, Mr. London, it seems to me that
Special Term may have found what I have suggested

it found.

But it went on to say that it didn't think that these
disclosures would really identify the plaintiff as the
patient to someone who did not already know the plaintiff was
the patient.
Now, that implies fchac certainly people who knew
the patient could identify him.
MR. LONDON:

Yes, Your Honor, it does, indeed.

QUESTION:

find it seems to me —

MR. LONDON:

And there were many who knew of her

doctor.
QUESTION:

And they might be able to identify the

patient through scan© of these events, but they certainly
wouldn't know the — every tiling that was disclosed.
So I would suppose you would argue this is, in itself,
enough.

That there has never been any finding here that there

was non-identification.
MR. LONDON:

We could, Your Honor, but we could go

very much further.
QUESTION: Well, the —
MR. LONDON: Because we say that the patient —
QUESTION:

I don't know why you — I don't know why

37
you don't stop there for at least — not — but just say
that that is -- you should be able to win your case on that,
on tli at if you -~
MR. LONDON:

I think we do, Your Honor, on that

alone; but it does go much further, and may I just speak once
again for a moment about this statutory presumption that the
— that identification was found, and that the Court of
Appeals was bound by that.
Mr. Karpatkin, the attorney for the psychiatrist
in this case, wrote a reply brief, in v/hich he complained
three times that he's not bound by this section because it
wasn't called to his attention, in the Court of Appeals.
Then he says we must have waived that right to
rely on this rule of practice, because it wasn't discussed
in the Court, of Appeals, and ha discusses this as a kind of
arcadian statute — that’s his word.
Now, there's nothing mysterious or secret about this
statute, it's published in all of the books on practice, and
in permanent ink. And, in point of fact, we did call Mr.
Karpatkin’s attention to that section in our Court of
Appeals brief, although he three times denied that we did.
At page 14 of our brief to the Court of Appeals, we did
discuss the section, vie said the Court must presume that any
question in fact in dispute will resolve by the Appellate
Division in favor of the respondent, and then cited Civil

Practice Law and Rules 5612(b),
May I, by the way, have the Court's permission to
respond to some errors and misstatements of fact in the
Reply Brief by letter to this Court?
QUESTION;

Mr. London, before you leave that, Ism

puzzled about your ex planation of New York practice.
Because I'm inclined to agree with what I think is Mr.
Justice White's view, that the Special Term found the issue
of disguising against you.
MR. LONDON:

It says that —

I understood him to say he found it

in our favor.
QUESTION:

Well, partially.

Impliedly there was

identification among friends, non-identification with respect
to anybody else.
MR. LONDON:
QUESTION:

Okay.

Well —

Now, is it your position that it's that

finding that is controlling on us, or is it something more
favorable to your —
MR. LONDON:
QUESTION:

Oh, something -No, no, wait till I finish my question.
I

MR. LONDON:
QUESTION;

Sorry.
—-

is it something more favorable to

you happened in the Appellate Division, and that it's that
finding that's binding
MR. LONDON:

us?

Which?

1 think it is the much more favorable

39

finding that is binding upon you.
QUESTION: And that's in the opinion of the Appellate
Division?
MR. LONDON:

No, no.

The fact is that this is by

operation of law, it is the contention of the patient here
that she is easily identified by a large number of unique
facts of her life, so that anyone who knew her and read the
book would be able to identify her.
identify her.

And in fact a lady did

We had her as a witness in the case below.

Now, it is that broad question of identification
that we say is binding by reason of a statute.
QUESTION: Well, let me give you this example.
Supposing that the Special Term had refused an injunction and
specifically found there was no irreparable injury, and you
want up to the New York courts and consistently disputed
whether or not there was irreparable injury, but you never
got any finding different from that in the Special Term.
Now, could you come here and say that because that
was disputed, even though the Special Term had found it
against you, we had to resolve it in your favor?
MR. LONDON:

No,Your Honor, because Your Honor is

assuming a situation in which I would be representing the
appellant, and the appellant is the one that has the facts
resolved against the appellant.

It is not the respondent —

that doesn’t work as against the respondent at all; it works

40

only in

She respondent’s favor, where a particular manner

and method of appeal is taken*
Nov?, as a matter of fact, Mr. Karpatkin had the
option of requesting findings of fact of the Appellate
Division, and invariably they are granted.

It may have been

those findings would have been against him, and it may be for
that reason that he did not want to ask the Court to make
specific findings of fact.

But he certainly did not make

those findings.
And any attorney who wants to go the Court of Appeals
and have questions of disputed fact considered by that ,court,
must raise those questions of fact. And they were not
raised by the psychiatrist in this case, and even in the
request for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals.
The request indicates that the appeal was sought
only on the question of fact — I mean on the question of
law; I'm sorry.

And that no questions of fact were to be

— no disputed questions of fact —
QUESTION 3

What do you think fact-finding-wise this

case comes to us, basedan what you find in Special Term and
the Appellate Division's opinion?
MR. LONDON:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.
No.

I mean, how does the case come to

us, with respect to the facts?
MR. LONDON:

The case comes to you —

41
QUESTION:

As to —

MR* LONDON:

As to the facts, with -the Appellate

Division opinion, which modified the Court of Special Term,
»

and, in addition, —
QUESTION:

Well, summarize just for me what is

the fact-finding with respect to identification?
MR. LONDON: The fact-finding with respect to
identification is that the patient was readily identifiable,
from the text of the book, that anyone who knew the patient,
although her name did not appear in the book, would immediately
know that she was the subject of the book.
QUESTION:

Well, that’s — that's the extent of it?

MR. LONDON:

That is the extent of it.

And no

less, Your Honor.
QUESTION :

I take it that you are arguing from

that tliat this would mean her identity would be widely known
in psychiatric circles.
MR. LONDON:

Widely known, certainly in any

circle, any people who knew her, who knew the events of her
life.
QUESTION:

Well, but specifically that group,

if she was identifiable to some psychiatrists, it would
readily expand, I take it, that's part of your case.
MR. LONDON:

Well, that would be it, but it would

be known, I think, to anybody that knew that her husband was a

42

man who began the practice of lav? at the age of fifty, and
prior to that time had been a speech writer, and that she had
a son who was a musical prodigy.

These are rather unique

facts.
QUESTIONS

Now, Mr. London, this gats me back to

Let me ask a question that no one else has

By basics, I mean this?

1257.3 at 28 U.S.C. provides

for a petition for certiorari here from a final judgment of
a State court.

Do you concede there is a final judgment

here when we've had no trial as yet?
MR. LONDON:

I don't concede that we’ve had a

final judgment, Your Honor, but I think this comes within the
exception that case law has made.

QUESTION: Well, it seems to me all these questions
are asked because of something less than a — than what we
would have after a full trial.
MR. LONDON:

Mr. Relinquish, there was the key case,

preliminary injunction did in fact come before tills Court,
and the Court stated that it had jurisdiction. And we are
not contesting the jurisdiction of the Court in this case.
QUESTION:

Of course, .it's not established by

That doesn't mean that we can't, as Justice
Blackmun suggests, conclude that there is no jurisdiction.
HR. LONDON; Certainly the Court can *—
QUESTION:

Because it was not easy, if you read

the Keith case closely, it was not easy for the Court to find
jurisdiction there, and I think there was some indication
of an almost abandonment by one party of any effort to
challenge the temporary injunction.
There's no such factor here.
MR. LONDON:

Oh, no, no, there isn't that factor

in this case, and we aren't stipulating —
QUESTION: As you say, you've been actively engaged
in it until a week ago, wasn't that it?
MR. LONDON:

Yes, Your Honor, on the exarainations

before trial alone.
I understood from Your Honor’s nod that we may
send you a letter, and I —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Yes, you may

supplement, you may respond to the reply brief.
MR. LONDON:

I would just like to add one word

with respect to the procedures that are followed before a
preliminary injunction is granted.
In New York State a preliminary injunction is merely
an adjunct to the final relief, the final injunction that
may be granted or denied, and it is a temporary order granted

44
simply to be certain that if final relief is given to the
plaintiff in the case., that final relief will rot be
meaningless, because if the temporary injunction was net
granted, we would have the sale of the book, and it xvouldn't
have done us any good after a period of timev to get the
final injunction.
Now, you did have evidence submitted by affidavit,
you did have oral argument, briefs, all the requirements of
due process are met, even the demand that a valid cause of
action be proved before the injunction can be granted.
There is, as was indicated before, a right even to
ask for an evidentiary hearing with respect to any crucial
fact, any crucial disputed fact.
And Mr. Karpatkin’s only complaint about that right,
or about that section allowing the hearing on a disputed fact,
* v

is that if he asks for it, the Court might have refused to
give it to him, because the facts in this case are complex.
Well, they certainly aren't complex.

They

couldn't be simpler.
All that we have here is the simple problem of the
book, the revelations in the book, and the problem of
identification which I think i3 evident from the book itself.
I thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs Thank you, Mr. London.
Mr. Karpatkin, you have four minutes left.

45
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARVIN M. KARPATKIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR, KARPATKIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

First, I'm delighted that my learned adversary now
agrees that this Court has jurisdiction.

One would not have

known that from reading his brief in oppostion to certiorari.
With respect to the presumption, it is evident that
respondent's position is lost without the presumption,
because it's evident that the basic finding in this case is
the finding which was made by Mr. Justice Silverman at
Special Term, which has in fact been confirmed by the
Appellate Division, just modifying the relief granted
therefrom, and also affirmed, regrettably without opinion,
by the Court of Appeals.
And the most that can be found from that finding,
I say, is, as Mr. Justice White observed, is an implication
— but even there, an implication which is insulated by a
double negative.
And it is — it seems to me that if due process
means anything, and if the special kind of due process which
is necessary before one grmts a presumptively unconstitution­
ally invalid prior restraint —
QUESTION:

But, Mr. Karpatkin, it seems to me

that you have said, at least., that whether there is
identification or not is a rather important fact in arriving

46
at soma resolution of the case,
MR, KARPATKINs

Absolutely.

QUESTIONj And if it*s awfully hard to tell what the
facts are, from the opinions , as the case comes to us,
it's rather hard to grapple with some legal issue, isn't it?
MR. KARPATKINs

I do not say that it is awfully

hard to tell, what I do say is that it's impossible to —
QUESTION.* Well, I know, but at least the Special
Term did not find that your client, or that the plaintiff
could not be identified among friends.
MR. KARPATKINs

The Special Term did not find

that plaintiff could be identified by anyone, Your Honor.
QUESTION;

Oh, I know, but —

MR. KARPATKINs

You can’t find a line there which

even hints at it.

He went beyond

And let's assume, hypothetically

47
that you went tc trial on the permanent injunction, and
Mr. London brought in 25 people who had said, Yes, they
read this book, without having any knowledge of the background,
and from reading that book they could identify the patient.
MR. KARPATKIN: The fact is, Mr, Chief Justice, —
QUESTION:

What would you have then?

MR. KARPATKIN:

Mr. London had three months,

Mr. London and his client had three months, and they sub­
mitted one slim affidavit by a friend, and —
QUESTION:

You don't a Ivy ays try a permanent

injunction on affidavits, do you?
MR. KARPATKIN: That is the customary if not the

In preliminary injunctions in

New York.
QUESTION:

I’m speaking of permanent injunctions.

MR. KARPATKIN:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, of course not.

If he could he would be — he

certainly could not be denied the opportunity to bring in
25 witnesses, could he?
MR. KARPATKIN:

Of course not, Mr. Chief Justice,

but it seems —
QUESTION;

Let’s assume that, though.

I never heard about it before Mr. London asked rue to read it?

I

put these factors together and

MR. KARPATXIN :

I assume that these witnesses would

be subjected to cross-examination, of course.
QUESTIONx

Oh, of course.

Of course they would.

MR. KARPATKIN % And I presume that the trier of
the facts would have an opportunity to evaluate this
testimony —
QUESTION;

Yes, and the trier would, as Mr. Justice

White just suggested, presumably make some findings of fact.
And then we wouldn't engage in this extensive cross-examination
of both of you gentleman to try to find out some of these
things, would we?

Wouldn't need to.

MR. KARPATKIN;

Mr. Chief Justice, I would say that

your argument follows completely, if this were not the case —
QUESTION; The question, maybe, not an argument.
MR. KARPATKIN:

I beg your pardon.

If this were

not the case where there has been'a prior restraint against
a concededly scientific, non-obscene

book, which has

now

been in effect for more than one year.
And it seams to me that is the crucial First
Amendment question which has not received any attention
at all by the courts of the State of Nevw York, and which
-must —

49
QUESTION; Whose burden was it to hurry that case
on for trial?

The restraint was against you, your client,

was it not?
MR, KARPATKIN:
certainly was.

Mr. Chief Justice — yes, it

But I saw it as my burden to attempt to

relieve the injunction, and to seek whatever tribunals could
be found with the power and the authority and the motivation
and the understanding of the First Amendment to do it.
QUESTION;

Did you — were any requests for a

stay of the injunction turned down, pending appeal?
MR. KARPATKIN;

No application was made by me for

a stay of the injunction, because —
QUESTION;

And you didn't make any — you didn’t

make any here?
MR. KARPATKIN;
