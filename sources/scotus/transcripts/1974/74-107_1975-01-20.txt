ORAL ARGUMENT OF HILLEL J. HOFFMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. HOFFMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it Please

the Court:
This is an appeal by the Commissioner of
Corrections of the State of New York from a decision of
the Second Circuit which held that when an inmate is
transferred between a medium-security institution and a
maximum-security institution, he is entitled to a due
process hearing regardless of the type of transfer, that is,
whether it is administrative or disciplinary or for any
other reasons.
The decision of the Court of Appeals was handed
down on June 3nd, 1974, approximately three weeks before
this Court’s decision in Wolff versus McDonnell and it
affirmed the decision of the Southern District of Mew York
'

)

which had been handed down in October of 1973.
The facts and circumstances in this case, your
Honor, are not very much in dispute at this point and,
essentially, what took place is that on June 2nd, 1972,
/

4
at the Wallkill Correctional Facility, which is a mediumsecurity institution in New York State, a group of Inmates
circulated a petition calling for the formation of an inmate
labor union.
The circulation of this petition caused a certain
degree of tension and unrest at the institution because
there was already in existence an inmate liason committee
which had been elected by the inmates and while the petitions
were being circulated, there was a rumor that was going
through the population that the liason committee had supported,
the labor union whereas, in fact, that was not true.
One of the members of the liason committee spoke
to the superintendent on the telephone.

The superintendent

was at his residence while the circulation was taking place
and the superintendent gave the committee member permission
^o address the inmates on the public address system and he
advised — this inmate advised his fellow prisoners that the
liason committee did not support the union and that any
inmates who wished to discuss the matter could meet at a
common meeting place.
Such a meeting did take place.
There was no violence.

There were no fights.

But there was loud talk and inmates

were trying to outshout each other and, essentially, the
Inmates were concerned, number one, with why the inmate
liason committee was not supporting the union and, number two,

5
many of them were fearful that because the union did not
have official sanction that perhaps there would be reprisals
directed toward those who had signed the union petition.
For the next two days after this meeting had
taken place, the institution seemed to be calm, at least
according to the superintendent’s testimony.
However, he directed his

deputies, his deputy

superintendents, to go into the population and ascertain
what the situation was and it was reported back to him by
his deputies that there was still a degree of tension and
unrest in the population because of this potential power
struggle between the liason committee on one side and the
union organizers on the other side.
Nov;, the Wallkill Correctional Facility is
basically an open facility.

There are no large cellblocks

as we have in a conventional prison.

There are merely

corridors and individual rooms and there is no way that
portions of this institution can be isolated in the event
that there is a disturbance.
The superintendent testified that he was concerned
that at a movie that was coming up on the following weekend
where all of the population would be in one room, that
there might be a disturbance, that the

friction might

result in a fight between the two factions and on the 6th of
June, he called the correction department in Albany and he

6
requested permission to transfer a small group of inmates
without any disciplinary consequences, merely to protect
them and to cool the situation and he was given that
permission and on June 8th, 1972, five out of eight inmates
who had been recommended by his deputies for transfer were
sent to other correctional facilities.
The superintendent himself did not choose where
they were sent to.
board in

That was done by the classification

Albany.
About a month after these transfers took place, the

Respondent Newkirk and his co-plaintiffs at that time began
the lawsuit in the Southern District of New York and they
asked the district judge for a temporary restraining order
returning them to Wallkill pending the outcome of the case.
The district judge denied that relief but set the
case down for an early trial.
The trial did take place in November of 1972 in
the Southern District of New York and by that time, two of
the group that had been transferred had already been paroled
and their cases were immediately dismissed as moot.
The district judge heard testimony from the two
remaining inmates and from the superintendent and from a
deputy commissioner of corrections and at the close of the
trial, the district judge reserved decision and as an effort
towards settling the case, the superintendent agreed to take

7
the two remaining plaintiffs back to Wallkill without their
having to go to any other facilities.
They were taken back and settlement negotiations
began.

We discussed the possibility of a consent decree

and in the interim, another of the plaintiffs was given
an open parole date and he was paroled in February of 1973.
At that point, there was only one plaintiff left.
That was Mr. Newkirk and he had been at Wallkill for three
or four months at this time.
job.

He had been returned to his

The superintendent believed that there were no longer

any difficulties and he affirmed that he would treat this
man fairly, that there would be no retribution for having
brought the lawsuit and at that point we decided to cease
our settlement efforts and to move to dismiss the case
as moot,
We made our motion in March of 1973 and the
district judge granted that motion as to the third inmate
who had been paroled but the district judge reserved
decision as to Mr. Newkirk because he was still in custody
and I might add that at that time, Mr. Newkirk was not yet
eligible for parole.

His earliest parole eligibility is

in July of 1975.
The district court handed down its decision in
October of 1973 and it held that although there i*as not a
sufficiently delineated controversy to warrant the granting

8
of an injunctions it nevertheless issued a declaratory
judgment and it held that Mr. Newkirk's rights had been
violated because he had not been informed in advance of the
rules of the institution that would lead to a transfer.
When the district court entered its judgment, it
added an additional requirement that if Mr. Newkirk was to be
transferred in the future that he would be entitled to notice
of charges and an opportunity to be heard.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hoffman —

MR. HOFFMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Am I right in thinking that this was

not a class action?
MR. HOFFMAN:

That is correct, your Honor.

It was

not.
We appealed the decision of the district court to
tne Second Circuit and what we were seeking was merely a
clarification that where a transfer is done for purely
administrative reasons, and it does not have adverse parole
consequences, where there is no punishment at the receiving
institution, where it is merely to separate rival groups of
Inmates, where there is no detriment to the inmates' records,
that these transfers should not be within the parameters of
the Due Process Clause.
And the Second Circuit, in our view, went even
further than the district judge.

There was a suggestion in

the district judge's opinion that, in fact, this was a
disciplinary transfer because there were no segregation
units at Walkill and, in effect, the superintendent was
punishing this group.
But the Court of Appeals went further and said
i

that regardless of the type of transfer, regardless of the
label placed on the transfer, that every inmate x*ho
experienced a change in custody level and who experienced
the deprivation of privileges that were alleged in this
case, would be entitled to a due process hearing.
QUESTION:

What was the date of the district

judge's decision?
MR. HOFFMAN:

A decision and judgment were handed

down in October of 1973.
QUESTION:

Well, he

had — he didn’t have the

benefit, of course, of Wolff against McDonnell, at that
time.
MR. HOFFMAN:

That is correct.

Your Honors, we believe that the decision of the
Court of Appeals should be reversed on two grounds.
Number one, as a matter of law.
And, number two, on the grounds of mootness.
And with respect to our first ground, we think
that this Court should declare and make it clear to the
lower federal courts that where an inmate is moved between

10

institutions and he is not placed in solitary confinement,
does not lose his good behavior allowances, does not suffer
adverse parole consequences, that in that situation, the
man is not entitled to a due process hearing of the sort
that he would receive under Wolff versus McDonnell.
In a footnote in Wolff, this Court stated

that

the procedures in that case were intended to apply to
solitary confinement, of loss of good behavior allowances,
but not necessarily to other losses or privileges.
Nov/, we think there are some very compelling
reasons why the Due Process Clause should not apply in this
situation.

*
First, many transfers are made for security reasons

and we have — we are required to act on confidential infor­
mation which it may very well be dangerous to reveal to the
inmate,
Both Superintendent Butler and the deputy
commissioner of corrections testified that as a matter of
correctional procedure, an inmate is never told in advance
that he is going to be transferred because by telling him in
advance, it may provoke the active misconduct which the
transfer is designed to prevent.
Very often we receive information from confidential
sources, sometimes from other inmates, and if we were to
reveal why someone was being transferred, it might very well

11
reveal the source.

It might provoke an act of violence and

as we have cited in our — both in our petition for cer­
tiorari and in our brief, there have been many cases In the
last two or three years where prison administrators have
been sued for damages

and sometimes personal damages for

failing to protect inmates from assaults by other

inmates

and the power to move inmates between institutions

is one

of the primary ways that these types of assaults can be
prevented.
These are situations where we don't want to bring
the man up on disciplinary charges.

We may not have enough

concrete information to bring him up on disciplinary charges.
We don't wish to adversely affect his record.
We merely want to remove him from that situation.
The second reason why we think that Due Process is
inappropriate here is that these procedures may well
inhibit some of our rehabilitation programs.
In New York State, we have a movement now toward
the use of medium and minimum security

facilities and these

programs are based on the assumption that if the program is
not working, or if the inmate is not working out in that
program, that we can move him

out of there and if we are In

a situation where, x^hen we move a group of men to a nexv
facility, we have to give every one of them a Due Process
hearing when we decide, for programmatic reasons, to move

12
them to another facility or to change them — to move them
into a new program, we feel that that would be a very undue
burden on the administration and* moreover, there may not be
much that the inmate himself can contribute at a hearing.
It may be for reasons that are totally unrelated
to his conduct.
Thirdly, we think that —■
QUESTION:

It may be, then, they don’t want the

hearing.
MR.. HOFFMAN:
QUESTION:

That may be true, your Honor.

You’d only have the hearing if he

asked for it.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes.

But I think many inmates faced

with a transfer to a facility that they might not wish to
go to would probably request a hearing if they could get one.
We also think that this Court should reject the
c oncept which is inherent in the Court of Appeals decision
and in the District Court decision that, because an inmate
is sent to an institution which has programs that he feels
will benefit him or which is geographically convenient for
him, that if he is removed from that institution, he must be
given a hearing and the Solicitor General has argued quite
extensively in their brief and we agree with them that,
merely because a man has been sent to a particular facility
does not mean that he should have a legal right protected by

13

the Due Process Clause to remain there.
We run a unitary correct corrections system.

We

have 2k institutions in the State of New York and our entire
program is based on the assumption that we can move men
freely between our facilities without having to give them
hearings every time we change their custody level.
VJe also think that this is one area where the
need for summary adjudication outweighs the individual
inmate's interest in Due Process.
First, as I mentioned before, we don't believe
that notice of charges and advance warning is appropriate
in many of these cases.

As I said, it would provoke the

very act that we are trying to prevent.
Secondly, with the transfers being made for
diagnostic reasons, it may not be helpful to the inmate to
tell him that he is being transferred because he has a
personality disorder or because he is intellectually
incapable of functioning in a particular program and we
don’t think that giving him a hearing in this type of
situation will benefit him or that he will be able to add
anything that will add the decision-makers in making their
decision.
Thirdly, we think that Due Process procedures are
certainly not helpful where inmates are feeing moved because
of budgetary reasons or because a particular facility is

14
being phased out or converted into a different type of
facility and if I may give an example here., in the fall of
1973 we converted the Sing Sing Correctional Facility from,

essentially, a long-term institution to a short-term ins­
titution and in the process we had to move 750 inmates to
maximum security facilities because that was the only place
we could send them.
Now, under the rationale of the decisions below,
I suppose that we would be required to give all of them Due
Process hearings because we changed their custody

level and

because they may not enjoy some of the privileges at the
new institutions that they enjoyed at Sing Sing and because
many of them may be further from their homes.
But I think if we had had to give 750 hearings in
that situation, it would have been a truly intolerable burden.
QUESTION:

Is there such a thing as a disciplinary

transfer?
MR. HOFFMAN:

In New York we try to avoid them.

The departments —
QUESTION:

Is there such a thing?

MR. HOFFMAN:

Technically speaking, there could be

such a thing because our disciplinary rules do provide for a
program change as one of the consequences of an act of
misconduct.
QUESTION:

Let's assume you had one of those.

15
HR. HOFFMAN:

If we had one of those, I believe

that the inmate’s remedy would be to complain to the super­
intendent and complain to the corrections commissioner that
he should have been given a hearing under our rules.
But the department’s policy is against disciplin­
ary transfers.
QUESTION:

Is there any way to find out whether

you do have them or not?
Do you keep any records?
MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, we keep records on the move­

ment of inmates and, usually, the —
QUESTION:

Records on why they are moved?

MR. HOFFMAN:

Normally the transfer order itself

will merely state administrative reasons, separation from
enemies.

It is usually a one-line statement and these are

very common and, as in this case, they don’t have disciplin­
ary consequences.
QUESTION:

Are they available?

MR. HOFFMAN:

They are not available to the inmate

but they could be available in a court proceeding if the
court directed that they be produced as a matter of
discovery.
QUESTION:

Well, if the inmate commits some

punishable act which, if he stayed in the same prison, he
might suffer some loss of privileges or he might be put in

16
solitary confinement or he might lose good time or something
like that.
If he commits one of those acts and he decides,
well, we have got to reassess this man, he really needs to be
some place else.
Now, if you just did that and just transferred him
to another type of institution because you didn’t think he
belonged in this one, you wouldn't call that a disciplinary
transfer, I take it.
MR. HOFFMAN:

No, because we don't believe that

the — there is no punishment intended and we don't believe
that the loss is sufficiently grievous.
QUESTION:

Why would you say there is ever a

disciplinary transfer, even if the commission of some
punishable act is the thing that triggers the transfer?
When would there ever be a disciplinary transfer?
MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, I think there would be — in

New York there would be a disciplinary transfer if a man
was brought up on charges for having violated the rules and
the disposicion at the hearing was that his program be
changed and that he be moved to another facility —» as a
result of that specific rule violation.

And it would be

entered in his record.
QUESTION.
transfer?

Yes, but why is that a disciplinary

That is just an administrative decision that he

17
belongs somewhere else.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, it is disciplinary in the

sense that it is a response to a violation of the rules and
it would be entered in his record and it would be a packet
of papers in his record which would Indicate that he was
brought up on charges so that it would indicate both to
the receiving institution and the parole board that, in
fact, he had been brought up on charges for this offense.
Now, in the ordinary situation —
QUESTION:

Well, then, I take it that in any —

that there will never be a due process problem arise in a
disciplinary transfer because he will have had a hearing.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes, if he is brought up on charges,

if he has committed a rule violation, our policy is that he
should get a hearing under our disciplinary rules.
The department does not favor disciplinary
transfers.

They want the Inmates to be brought up on

charges.
QUESTION:
soning :1s, then.

Well, that is xtfhat the backward rea­

You — you say that if it is disciplinary,

he does get a hearing.

But what if he claims it is

disciplinary and you say, well, it is just administrative.
That is the problem.
MR. HOFFMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, it is a problem but we feel —

That is the problem here, I think.

18
isn’t it?
MR. HOFFMAN:

It is a problem but we feel that

this is an area where the balance should be struck in favor
of the state rather than the inmate.
An inmate, when he brings a lawsuit, will always
claim that he is being punished for some reason.

He may not

be punished at all.» but that is one of the ways that he can
get into federal court under Section 1983.

He has to claim

a deprivation of due process or a denial of equal protection.
So I think that the mere fact that a man claims
that he Is being punished is not
QUESTION:

No.

necessarily dispositive.

Nor on the other hand does the

mere fact that you deny that he is being punished mean that
he is not being punished.
MR. HOFFMAN:

That is correct.

But we feel that in

this area, where there is no loss of good behavior allowance,
where he is not sent to segregation, where there is no effect
on his parole eligibility, that the balance should be struck
in our favor, rather than in favor of the Inmate. We also
QUESTION:

In this case, all it took was a telephone

call.
MR. HOFFMAN:

It was a telephone call followed by

formal paperwork that went —
QUESTION:

But I mean, the decision was made just

as the result of a telephone call.

13
MR. HOFFMAN:
QUESTION:

"I want to get these guys out of here.”

MR. HOFFMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Yes, it was deemed an emergency.

That's all there was to it.

MR. HOFFMAN:

It was deemed an emergency situation

but the department in Albany determined—
QUESTION:

Well, who determined it was

an emergency?

The warden did.
MR. HOFFMAN:

The warden did, yes.

But the depart­

ment in Albany determined where the men went, so they — the
warden did not have the power to select some .faraway insti­
tution.

They might have been moved to another institution

that was very close.
QUESTION:

How many institutions are there, penal

institutions are there in your state?
MR. HOFFMAN:

We have a total of 24 and we have five

maximum security prisons.
QUESTION:

Auburn, Clinton and —

MR. HOFFMAN:

Auburn, Clinton, Attica, Green Haven

and Great Meadow are the maximum security —
QUESTION:

Maximum.

MR. HOFFMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And there are 24 and they are all

the state, I suppose.
MR. HOFFMAN:

All over the state

over

20
QUESTION:

In every area of the state.

MR. HOFFMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, that's correct.

Every section of the state.

MR. HOFFMAN:
QUESTION:

That's true.

I take it there are additional municipal

and county institutions?
MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, those, we have no jurisdiction

over those.
QUESTION:

No, no, I say there are in New York

State, in addition to the state institutions you mentioned.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Oh, yes, and Neiv York City has its

own correctional system and the counties have their own
county penetentiaries for misdemeanants.
We take only the felony prisoners.
QUESTION:

Those are short-term, short-timers,

are they not?
MR. HOFFMAN:

We take felony prisoners and we also

take detainees from New York City under a special contract
with the city.
We have approximately 800 detainees from New York
City who are awaiting trial and we took them because the
New York City institutions were overcrowded.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hoffman, could he have been sent to

Clinton in the first place?
MR. HOFFMAN:

Certainly.

He could have been sent

21
there by the classification or the reception committee.
QUESTION:

Had he been sent there, we wouldn’t have

a lawsuit, I suppose.
MR. HOFFMAN:

That Is correct and that is one of

the things that we are afraid of, that once you establish
the principle that if a man's custody level Is changed or if
he Is at an Institution that is farther from the place of
conviction, then we feel that inmates who are coming in the
classification process will also request the same due process
he aring.
QUESTION:

Well, we have been talking about an issue

that may not be here at all, if there is no jurisdiction here.
MR. HOPPMAN:

Yes, as an alternative grounds, we

raised in the District Court and the Court of Appeals the
issue of mootness.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't this --

QUESTION:

Why isn't this primary?

If we don't

have jurisdiction, you'll never get -—
MR. HOPPMAN:

Well, having — having lost on this

issue twice in the lower courts, I felt that we had to brief
the merits as well as the mootness question but I think this
is clearly an example of a moot case.
This mail was returned to the institution.

It was

entirely speculative whether he would be transferred again.
And it was not a class action and we think that the district

22
judge could have dismissed the case and now the man has
been moved to a minimum-security facility in New York City
which indicates tangentially that it is quite positive that
he probably will be released on parole when he reaches his
eligibility date in July.
QUESTION:

But it iss in the words of the many,

capable of repetition as to this particular Respondent.
MR. HOFFMAN:
yes.

Yes, it is capable of repetition,

If —
QUESTION:

Characteristically, the cessation of

enjoined acts doesn't moot a case for an injunction, does
It?
MR. HOPPMAN:

No, not necessarily, but I think one

has to weigh the likelihood that the conduct will occur
again.

In our view, we felt there was — it was not very

likely that Mr. Newkirk was going to be transferred in the
near future.
QUESTION:

Was there any injunction entered here?

MR. HOPPMAN:
QUESTION:

No, no.

Just a declaratory judgment.

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes,

Yes, and the district judge

felt that there was not a sufficient basis to grant an
injunction.

He only granted a declaratory judgment.

If I may save my remaining time?

Mr. Pochoda.

ORAL ARGUMENT OP DANIEL POCHODA, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP RESPONDENT
MR. POCHODA:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it Please

the Court:
The transfer of Respondent James Newkirk in June
of 1972 is characterized by two things.
In the first place, it was a move from a mediumsecurity institution, Wallkill, to Clinton, a maximumsecurity institution and therefore, Respondent contends it
constituted grievous loss under constitutional standards to
Mr. Newkirk.
Secondly, the transfer itself was based on
conclusions made by prison officials about Mr. Newkirk’s
behavior, about his conduct at Wallkill.
Respondent’s position is, that in light of these
two factors, he was entitled to at least minimal procedural
due process prior to his removal from Wallkill.
QUESTION:

What was the first factor here?

I

want to be sure.
POCHODA:

The first factor is the change from

a medium to a maximum security —
QUESTION:

Right.

MR, POCHODA:

-— institution, thereby resulting in

a major change and a loss of interests protected by the
14th Amendment.

24
And the second factor was that the transfer was
based on evaluations of conduct.
QUESTION:

How do you define "minimal?"

MR. POCHODA:

The amount and procedure, your

Honor?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. POCHODA:

Well, the — we have not appealed

allegations against Mr. Newkirk and an

transit situations.

25
QUESTION:

When you said a moment ago* "Loss of

interests protected by the ltyth Amendment"in connection with
the transfer from VJalllclll to Clinton, what are those
interests?
MR. POCHODA:

The most dramatic deprivation

suffered by Mr. Newkirk was a loss of his liberty interests.
We feel that, as the courts below found, that an analysis
of the differences of the two institutions revealed quite
clearly that a move from the' medium-security institution
>8

to the maximum-security institution resulted in restrictions
in every area of Mr. Newkirk’s liberties and freedoms.

He was more closely confined at Clinton,

MR. POCHODA:

Yes.

Yes.

In fact, the object ■— I

mean, the object of Wallkill Itse.lf, as defined by New York
State, is to provide relief from the regimentation and
restrictions found in maximum-security institutions.
New York State has set up, as Mr. Hoffman stated,
a system of intentional gradation between institutions and
this is codified b.y regulation and New York State by that —
and by the way, it runs Wallkill — has recognized that there
is a need to provide a different atmosphere to prepare people
for release.
There

is a need to instill individual respon­

sibility into the inmate, to have actions governed by that
Internalized control and not just by the physical bodily

26
restraints and every witness at trial, including prison
officials, attested to the substantial

differences in terms

of an individual's freedoms and liberties.
QUESTION:

Any other interests?

I am thinking of

the subsequent Second Circuit case which apparently held
that even in a transfer from Institutions of comparable
security there was a hearing required.
MR. POCHODA:

Yes, that case of Haymes versus

Montanye with the — which is presently pending before this
Court for cert, I just xvould like to state, we don't feel is
at all equivalent to this case and only gets mentioned
because both the briefs of the Petitioners and the United
States characterise it, we think, in an erroneous manner.
In fact, the court there was not concerned with,
and did not state that the important issue was the fact that
there may have been grievous loss.
Well, in fact, the court directed

the Second

Circuit, which was just remanded on a dismissal of a
complaint, directed the Trial Court to decide whether the
transfer was, in fact, a punitive transfer — was, in fact,
a disciplinary transfer.
That case concerns

the situation mentioned by

Mr. Justice Stewart where the inmate involved claimed that
the transfer was, in fact, for a violation of a rule and
the Second Circuit mentioned that it seemed to them that a

27
prima fascle case had been made and that the transfer might
well have been made just to get around the rules of the
institution, the disciplinary regulations that require a
hearing.
QUESTION:

You don't claim, then, if someone is

transferred from Wallkill to a comparable place near Buffalo
he has suffered a grievous loss because he is closer to
Buffalo than he is to New York?
MR. POCHODA:

No, we feel that the major loss here

is due to the differences in the institution.
QUESTION:

Well, I know that is the major loss,

but do you claim that there is any protected interest by
virtue of the fact that you are transferred ^iOO miles away?
MR. POCHODA:

Well, it is hard to make that judgment

without having the record before us.

It might be, in fact,

that a result of that transfer, there are certain interests
that would be affected.

There may be freedoms that are denied

by that transfer in a specific case.
QUESTION:

Like what?

MR. POCHODA:

Well, it may be that the transfer —

well, you say, only because of the distance involved

and no

difference in the institutions?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. POCHODA:

I would say probably no, probably

it would not be in and of itself a violation or

an

28

infringement on 14th Amendment interests and that the
operative fact in this case, in this situation, was the
distinct differences, as attested to by all of the witnesses,
including the prison officials, the distinct differences
between the two institutions that every aspect of the inmate's
life was more restrictive and more repressive in terms of
physical restraints, bodily restraints, freedom of choice,
freedom of movement.
I should also add that once — upon arrival at
Clinton, Respondent was placed in segregation for a lengthy
period.

For four and a half weeks he was denied every

opportunity, every freedom of movement and was kept locked
in his cell for 23 hours a day and the District Court stated
specifically that he was placed in segregation upon arrival
at Clinton.
QUESTION:

Do you agree with Mr. Hoffman that he

could have been assigned at Clinton in the first place?
MR. POCHODA:

Oh, yes, your Honor.

In fact,

Mr. Newkirk originally was assigned to a maximum-security
institution.
QUESTION:

But would

MR. POCHODA:

you be here had that happened?

We would not be here if he had

remained at a maximum—security institution

throughout his

incarceration.
QUESTION:

So you are not complaining about the

29
classification initially?
HR. POCHODA:

No, no.

there is no absolute right to

No, in fact, we admit that
be placed at Wallkill.

We agree with the State of New York and with the
United States in its amicus brief that there is no right to
be placed at Wallkill, that the state, in fact, did not have
to set up Wallkill, just as the state did not have to set up
a parole system.
QUESTION:

But you feel that once he has been

placed there, a right flows from it, even though it might
have been an erroneous assignment, administratively?
MR. POCHODA:

Yes, yes, we feel it is analagous,

for example, to placement on parole, that even if a person is
erroneously granted parole and even though the state does not
have to set up a parole system, once placed in that insti­
tution, assuming this Court finds that there is an interest,
that- there is a loss of 14th Amendment interests, in terms
of a change from that type of institution to the maximumsecurity institution, there is a right to be granted
procedural due process before removal.
We are also not contesting —
QUESTION:

So you think that inmates are entitled to

participate in all reclassification decisions as long as the
decision may increase the severity of confinement?
Whether disciplinary or not, if they just — if they

30
just decide, well, this man isn’t getting along quite as
well here, he should —
MR. POCHODA:
QUESTION:

He — excuse me.

— and we think that he would rest

better in another type of institution.
MR. POCHODA:

Yes, the problem is with the use of

the words "disciplinary" and "administrative."

I mean, most

of the trial courts, when confronting this question and
when confronted with a similar situation, have stated that a
transfer is, in fact, disciplinary 'when it involves the
closer custody, when it involves this type of change, when
it involves punishment in fact, because it is clear that the
difference In life at Clinton as opposed to Wallkill involves
a severe deprivation and punishment to the Inmate.
And the courts have recognized almost the definition
of disciplinary is when you impose punishment in response
to an Inmate’s behavior or in response to conclusions about
an inmate and we are saying, when those two instances are
present, since there Is no way — there is no way for this
Court to draw a line between xvhat is disciplinary, unless
you look to the objective conditions that when, in fact, the
change resulted In loss of an interest protected by the
14th Amendment and when that change comes about because of
conclusions about conduct, again, we say that the inmate
should not be involved and this characterization by the

31
Petitioners and the United States is not accurate.
And I should say, and I'd like to get to it in
awhile, that many of the characterisations of the scope and
effect of the holdings below are not accurate and it does not
cover the ground that is characterized or put forth here
t oday.
QUESTION:

When at Wallkil‘4 it becomes overcrowded

and Clinton is underused so that as %n administrative matter
some people have got to be chosen to go from Wallklll to
Clinton, now, do you say that everybody who is involved in
that kind of a transfer is entitled to a hearing?
MR. POCHODA:

No, your Honor.

The court below

specifically ~ this is one of the examples I was referring
to — specifically did not say — say that in that case
this particular holding is not enforced.
It Is only when the transfer is due to conclusions
about the inmate, about the inmate itsellf, so that the inmate
can have some valuable input to the decision.
QUESTION:

Even though, in my hypothesis, certainly

the man is subjected to the sort of constraints that you sayamount to a restriction on his liberty,
MR. POCHODA:

That Is right, your Honor.

We say

that even when that loss is present, in terms of a procedural
due process right, it would not exist because it would be
meaningless, that the court specifically stated — both of

32

the lovrer courts stated, that unless the transfer is based
on some evaluation about the Individual himself, so that the
individual could contribute something of value to a due
process hearing, the case is not applicable.
QUESTION:

Let me alter Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s

hypothetical case just a trifle — perhaps not a

trifle.

A decision is made administratively by the direc­
tor of the institutions for the state that 500 prisoners
from one category, let us say medium security, must be
transferred to other facilities and the only other ones
available are maximum security and the warden in each
institution is then directed to determine which of the
prisoners in his institution are marginally more dangerous,
more in need of maximum security than others.
Now he has got to make a value judgment to effect
that transfer In order to relieve the overcrowding.

A due

process hearing?
MR. POCHODA:

Well, to the extent that the decision

involves conclusions about individuals, we think that there
would be minimal due process required.
Of course, the inmate — there are many other
considerations that may enter into a decision and the warden
Is free to use his discretion, to use his expertise, as this
Court recognized in the case of Morrissey y-ersus Brewer, to
use whatever other facts that are around that are important

33
to that decision, certainly, but to the extent that there
also are individual facts where the inmate can have input,
we contend, and the courts below held that there should be
at least minimal procedures.
Let me just state that —
QUESTION:

May I ask a question before you move on?

What is the offense for which Mr. Newkirk was
convicted?
MR. POCHODA:
QUESTION:

And what was his sentence?

MR. POCHODA:
QUESTION:

It is a manslaughter offense.

It was 20 to life.

20 until life.

He was first of all

improsioned in Sing Sing, did you say?
MR. POCHODA:
QUESTION:

In 1962, yes.

Suppose he had been transferred from

Sing Sing to Clinton and he felt that Sing Sing was more
congenial and really didn't want to go to Clinton?

Would

that entitle him to a due process hearing?
MR. POCHODA:
the fact’s of this case.

No, it wouldn't, your Honor, not under
I think we should make it very

clear because I think that both the Petitioners and the
United States have completely misrepresented the scope and
effect of the holding below, that the holding below specifically limited its constitutional ruling, as it properly
did, to the facts of this case.

34
And the facts of this case Involve a transfer from
one type of institution to another of greater security and
it specifically declined — the Court of Appeals — it is
on

paise 27 of the petition for

cert — specifically

declined to extend this rule to other factual situations.
It stated we don't have to decide and we feel that
we cannot decide in the context of this case that question.
The court did not decide, for example, what would be
required in a situation from one maximum

for a transfer

from one maximum-security institution to another maximumsecurity institution and it should have not — it should
not and that should await further adjudication, further
records and should not be done on the basis of a hypothe­
tical plaintiff.
QUESTION:

Is it your position basically that

whenever there is a transfer to a more favorable level of
institution, that some sort of vested right accrues and that
cannot be denied without a hearing?
MR. POCHODA:

Yes, it — well, it would depend.

We would say — we wouldn't use the word "more favorable,"
we would use that, if, in fact, the differences involved in
terms of the initial —
QUESTION:

There are three levels of security

institutions basically and —
MR. POCHODA:

Yes.

35
QUESTION:

— I am thinking in terms of a transfer

to one that would be regarded as more favorable, less
security.
MR. POCHODA:

I see.

In terms of the gradation

set up by the State of New York itself.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. POCHODA:

Yes.

Yes, we

feel that upon a factual

analysis of the difference between those Institutions the
court properly found that there were 14th Amendment interests
that would be infringed upon, upon a move from a lesser
security to a higher security and only in that case is
inmate

an

entitled to a minimal due process hearing.
f:

Now, again, we must reiterate, we are not contending
that a person cannot be removed.

We are also hot even

contending that —- that persons cannot be removed immediately
and the court below specifically held that in emergency
situations, people can be immediately removed, even prior to
a hearing and the hearing can be granted at a subsequent
time.
We are not in any way taking — attempting to take
away the power of the prison officials to remove anybody or
any group of inmates from any one institution.
All we are saying is that there is an interest on
all sides, the state as well as the individual, that that
discretion be informed discretion, that everybody has an

36
interest in avoiding errors.
In fact, in this particular case, the record
demonstrates conclusively that a person who was erroneously
transferred and the state itself, who as stated by
Mr. Hoffman and his peers throughout their brief, they are
concerned about assaults.

They are concerned about one

inmate attacks another inmate.
They have no interest in removing the wrong Inmate
and that is what happened in this case.
In fact, Mr. Newkirk himself, the Court of
Appeals found, his transfer was based on misinformation.
It was based on third-hand reports, the lack of procedures,
the lack of accurate fact-finding led to mistakes.
There could be no interest on any side in such
proceudres.
recognised

There also is no interest, as this Court
in Morrissey, to have inmates respond in this

way to arbitrary action.
It can only
QUESTION:

hurt chances for rehabilitation.

Mr. Pochoda, in answer to the question

a little while ago from my brother Powell, I — your
answer surprised me because I didn’t think it had been
your theory.
You

have talked about 14th Amendment interests

being protected.

So

Well, what the 14th Amendment protects,

there are three rather basic things.

37
It protects life, liberty and property — or
property from being taken away without due process of law.
Now, life is not necessarily a 14th Amendment
interest; neither is liberty; neither is property.

What the

14th Amendment says Is that a person cannot be deprived of
any one of those three things without due process of law.
I had understood your claim to be that what was
involved here was a deprivation of liberty,

xtfhen a person,

an inmate, Is transferred for reasons having to do with an
evaluation of him, from a minimum-security institution to a
maximum-security institution.
But in answer to my brother Powell, you indicated
bhat your theory was he acquired a property Interest when
he was transferred to a minimum or medium security institution
and that to take — to transfer him from there to a maximum
security institution would be depriving him of property.
Has that been your theory?
MR. POCHODA:
QUESTION:

No, your Honor, we -—

Well, then, I think you made a mistaken

answer to my brother Powell.
MR. POCHODA:

I didn’t realize I had indicated that.

Je believe that the — that is a direct infringement
on the liberty interests, that —
QUESTION:

And only that, isn't it?

doesn't take his life.

We can agree on that.

It certainly

3S
MR. POCHODA:

Well, we feel that It might well be

argued that Mr. Newkirk had, in fact —
QUESTION:

Well, it might be argued, but what is

your argument?
MR. POCHODA:

We did also argue that there was a

property interest involved.
QUESTION:

What property interest?

MR. POCHODA:

That he had, by meeting the criteria

for placement at Wallkill and successfully being placed at
Wallklll because of maintaining a good record at maximum
security institutions, he had become — availed himself of
the benefits provided by Wallkill.
Those benefits included training in a marketable
vocation.

He was only able to

train in his intended

profession at Wallkill.
QUESTION:

So he did acquire a vested interest.

MR. POCHODA:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Then you answered correctly that, under

your theory — Mr. Justice Poxvell and I was mistaken about
your theory.
MR. POCHODA:

I see.

We believe that both interests

were -- an inmate would be deprived of both interests by a
move from Wallkill back to a security institution.
The liberty interest is more direct in terms of
looking at the differences between Wallkill and Clinton but

39
that he had also acquired a state-created benefit that he
had a reasonable expectation of maintaining that benefit
until his release from prison because that is the usual
procedure at Wallklll, that persons

stay there until

released and very few people have transferred back,
QUESTION:

And that was his property.

QUESTION:

The transfer from Wallklll to Clinton,,

because of overcrowding that I asked you about earlier,, would
I would think, deprive him of that property interest, if he
had it.
MR. POCHODA:

Your Honor, we believe that, in fact,

the transfer because of overcrowding was would deprive him of
a liberty and a property interest, but that the due process procedural due process — procedural due process would not be
applicable to any situation where the deprivation was based
on conclusions that had nothing to do about the inmate, that
it would be meaningless — it would be meaningless to offer
a hearing in such situations.
Clearly, one could be offered but we feel that it
would be a meaningless gesture to have an inmate come in and
to try to offer some evidence that the budget really isn’t —
but
QUESTION: We11,/why couldn’t the inmate say, "Lgiok
if you have got to transfer 300 people out of the 1,000 that
are at Wallklll, it shouldn’t be me, because I have done so
well here."

40
MR. POCHODA:

Well, I believe that the inmate might

well, but that would be a substantive or equal protection
argument and in this case we are concerned only with pro­
cedural due process in this case and the court below was
only concerned and, of course, the record and the briefs
only concern procedural due process.
QUESTION:

But the selection for transfer involves

a value judgment that prisoners A, B and C are going to be
moved but D, E and P are not going to be moved.
Now, is that a different kind of a value judgment
by the warden than the one that was made here?
MR. POCHODA:

Your Honor, we are not trying to

take that judgment away from the warden.
QUESTION:

No, I didn't say that.

MR. POCHODA:
those judgments.

We —

— are saying the warden can make

But if the judgment — if, as a part of

the process, a part of the input to that judgment Involves
facts aoout the inmate, the inmate should participate.

The

inmate cannot participate and say, I am better than B or C,
but if the warden — who may be misinformed about the inmate,
as he was in this case, to that extent, to the extent that
facts about the individual go into that decision, he should
be provided due process hearing, just as, to the extent that
facts about an individual go into the decision to deprive a
person of parole.

41
QUESTION:

Well, when I sort out your answer and

read it in light of the way I read the District Court’s
opinion and the Court of Appeals, this means that potentially,
every one of these 500 transferees would be entitled to a
hearing.
Now, you suggest that the Solicitor General and
your friend misread these opinions.

I read them the same

way they do and coupled with your answer, it would call for
a hearing in every one of these cases.
MR. POCHODA:

If there was a need to transfer 500

persons?
QUESTION:

Yes.

If they itfanted a hearing.
MR. POCHODA:

Well, we — we feel that it wouldn’t

necessarily, that if it was only on budgetary, that there
might be, as I cited to Mr. Justice Rehnquist, a separate
question about a rational plan, a separate question of a
substantive due process question or an equal protection
concern, that unless there was some finding about the
individual that was involved, there would not be

procedural

due process requirements.
QUESTION:

In other words, if they sorted them out

by saying, the 300 people here who have been here the shortest
time would be the ones.
here the longest time.

Or the 300 people here who have been
Or if we say xve are going to take

42
every 10th, just at random.

On none of those selections

would you claim any right to it — to a hearing.

Is that

ri ght ?
MR. P0CH0DA:
QUESTION:

That is right.

But

if, on the other hand, they say,

the following 300 people are going to be the ones to be
transferred for budgetary reasons, or capacity reasons,
because we think those are the 300, after evaluating all of
our population, those are the

300 who seemed to have less —

the least potential for benefit at the program here, then
you would say there would have to be a due process hearing,
right?
MR. POCHODA:

Yes.

The inmate, I don't believe,

would have a — would be able to judge himself or compare
himself to the other 299 people.

But to the extent that it

is based on some evaluation —
QUESTION:

It was found that he had a — pejora­

tively found against him —
MR. POCHODA:
QUESTION:

Yes.

— he had a — that he liras in the group

that had the least potential for benefit at that institution
and therefore he was going to be in that group that was
transferred to the greater security institution.
Would he then have a right to a due process hearing?
MR. POCHODA:

Yes.

43
QUESTION:

I gather you’d say he would.

MR. POCHODA:

Yes, your Honor and I think the record

in this case demonstrates why it is necessary.

By the stan­

dards put forth by the State of New York and the United
States, Mr. Newkirk would not have been, is not entitled, as
they say, to a due process hearing.
He is not entitled even though he suffers the same
loss as a person who gets a disciplinary hearing and even
though it is also based on evaluation about his conduct.
It seems to me, for instance, that the rule they
propose, on Its face, is a violation of equal protection.
There is no rational reason why a person who is —
who acts' wrongfully, who acts in violation of institutional
rules before being removed and suffer a loss is allowed and
permitted due process and a person who acts totally properly
and legally, who suffers the same loss on the basis of his
conduct, does not get a due process hearing.
QUESTION:

So would a random selectee suffer the

same loss and yet you are not even claiming that he is entit­
led to procedural

due process.

MR. POCHODA:
QUESTION:

Why?

MR. POCHODA:
not be relevant.

That is because —*

Because procedural due process would

It would be a meaningless gesture.

QUESTION:

What if they transferred just left-handed

ilij

persons?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. POCHODA:

Again, we think that might well be a

violation of substantive due process or an invidious
discrimination

based on the equal protection clause.

QUESTION:

Mr. Pochoda, have you ever been at the —

well, I don’t know whether you have ever been at the federal
institution at Springfield, Missouri?
MR. POCHODA:
QUESTION:

I haven't.

But there — and I suppose this is

characteristic of 3ome state institutions, they have varying
types of confinement.

They have maximum security.

They have

minimal security, really minimal and they have some inter­
mediate stock.
Now, If this Respondent were transferred next week
from one level to another, would you be here?

Within the

same Institution but into a different type —
MR. POCHODA:
QUESTION:

Yes, I believe so.

I am not speaking of the whole or some­

thing like this.
MR. POCHODA:

I can’t say with certainty, your

Honor, but I believe that might well be the type of change
that would affect the liberty interest.

I think this Court

and every court that I know that has considered the question
has stated that a transfer even within any one particular

45
institution which, in fact, deprives a person of liberty
interest, such as segregation or solitary confinement,
courts have consistently stated that that transfer must be
accompanied

by procedural due process, regardless of the

way they are put on that transfer by prison administrators.
Courts have recognised on every level, all of the
trial courts have considered this question, including the
appellate courts ~~ and the appellate courts have stated time
and again that we must have an objective test, that it defeats
the purpose and it would make the due process clause a
nullity if prison officials are allowed to say, well, we
are going to have — this inmate is going to be forced to
suffer the same loss as a person who is disciplined but we
are going to call it administrative, therefore, he is not
entitled to procedural due process.
QUESTION:

Let’s suppose a prisoner violates a —

che prison rules several times and on each occasion he is
disciplined, he is given a hearing and he is -— some kind of
discipline is imposed, he has lost some good time or he has
spent some days In solitary or something and the policy is
that periodically they review a man's situation and here,
they look back on a man’s record and they say that he is -after hearing, he has been found to have had these six
infractions.

We think he belongs somewhere else.

Now, it isn’t they are transferring him because of

46
his conduct, but it is for conduct that has already been
adjudicated.
MR. POCHODA:

Yes, we would think that.

In fact,

he would be entitled to procedural due process but the
requirements —
QUESTION:

Now, what would he contribute?

What

would be the purpose of such a hearing?
MR. POCHODA:

Well, I was going to say that the

requirements have been met in that case, that the only —
the only — that transfer only concerns conduct that already
has been, after due process hearing, been

found to have, in

fact,occurred and that you wouldn’t have to — if, in fact,
the institution has a rule, for example, that six violations
will lead to transfer and after a hearing, the inmate is
found, on six different occasions to have violated the
insoitutional rule, he wouldn’t have a separate —- separate
seventh

hearing because it would, again, be meaningless;

thac, in fact, there, our test is met but on every occasion
where conduct is involved and that conduct in any way led
to the decision to transfer, the person was provided With
procedural due process.
QUESTION:

Well, then, you don't really — you

aren’t really urging that — urging your entitlement to a
hearing in order to participate in the judgment of the
adminis orator as to where he belongs•

47
MR. POCHODA:
QUESTION:

No.

We are not attempting to —

You just want to make sure he is

operating on accurate facts.
MR. POCHODA:

Exactly,

We feel that it Is exactly

analagous to the situation in Morrissey versus Brewer, that ,
as this Court recognized» there is
decision and then there

a

factual part of a

is also a predictive part.

I mean, even if a person Is found, for example, to
have violated a technical — one of the technical rules of
parole, it doesn't automatically mean he is going to be
recommitted.

The hearing is to decide what the facts are

and what the attitude of the inmate Is, what mitigation
circumstances are.
But, of course, the final decision is still left
to prison administrators, as It properly should

[be] and

the same exact situation exists in this case.
QUESTION:

It seems to me when you answered

Mr. Justice White, you added another factor that might be
critical.

You said, "If the institution has a rule that

six violations lead to transfer, then they could do it xdLthout an additional hearing."
Mr. Justice White didn't begin with a premise that
there was an Institutional rule, but that the warden, In the
process of evaluating all prisoners who had had problems,
said, here is a man with six violations.

We think he has got

48
to go somewhere else.
Now, there is no rule.

This is just a value

judgment that six is enough for this man and it might take
into account the nature of the crime which he committed in
the first place, the length of the sentence which he

had,

long or short.
What do you say about that?

Must there be a

hearing for that?
MR. POCHODA:

No, no, I just use that as a hypo­

thetical in terms of the rule, but, again, if all of the
factors that concern the conduct of the inmate are already,
have already been the subject of a procedural due process
hearing, another one is not necessary and, of course,
although there may be, again, a substantive due process
problem if, for example, other people with six violations
are not transferred, that is not the subject of this suit.
We think —*
QUESTION:

Will you state —■ I know you have to

do it briefly — your position on mootness?
MR. POCHODA:

Yes, we feel that, in fact, what

has occurred in this case is, at best, a temporary voluntary
cessation that, in fact, it is a weaker case than others
where the Court has ruled that a voluntary cessation

is

not enough because Petitioners have maintained their policy
of this type of transfer and, in fact, Mr. Newkirk is

49
immediately and presently subject to that policy.
There have been no intervening events such as the
end of a strike or events in Viet Nam or other events that
this Court has recognized in other cases that make recurrence
unlikely.
It Is totally within the control of Petitioners
to, right this second, transfer Mr. Newkirk Immediately and
for the same reasons it did in the first place.
QUESTION:

Is Mr. Newkirk in any other -— is he

In any different position in this respect from other
prisoners?
MR. POCHODA:

Well, we believe he is in a sense,

because —
QUESTION:

Has he been threatened in any way?

MR. POCHODA:

Well, v*e believe he is to the extent

that he has already experienced this conduct and therefore
he is presently suffering continuing

harm.

He is not

acting — he is refraining from certain actions that he would
participate in had he not been transferred, in light of his
initial transfer and the continuing policy.
And, secondly, the initial transfer is on
Mr. Newkirk’s record.
Of course, also, the fact that the Initial transfer
has meant that we have a completed record in this case and
that all of the facts have been fully laid out for the Court.

50

QUESTION:

When you say he is refraining from

certain conduct which he might otherwise do because of this
risk,of this experiences what kind of conduct do you have
in mind?
MR. POCHODA:

Well, it is the same type of conduct

that led to his initial transfer, which is perfectly legal
and proper conduct in terms of being involved

in petitions,

which the Petitioners themselves state are legal and It is
only because of reactions of others that they decided to
transfer five people in this case.
That is, refraining from legal conduct but, of
course, the Petitioners' transfer policy allows them to
move out persons who are involved In legal conduct, to
impose this punishment on the basis of legal conduct without
giving the reasons.
So he is in the exact same position as he was
minutes before his transfer in June 8th, 1972.

Nothing

has changed.
QUESTION:

Of course, when you say that, you are

speculating on what he was doing in terms of his behavior.
MR. POCHODA:

Well, except that the policy dees

not depend on Mr. Newkirk.

Given their transfer policy of,

that people can be transferred for any reason, without any
justifications or effort, it doesn't depend on the behavior.
He can be transferred tomorrow, no matter what he does.

51
There is nothing that is preventing the operation
of this policy on Mr. Newkirk.

It does not depend on what

Mr. Newkirk does, no.
In fact, in this case, the court below found that
in spite of Mr. Newkirk's actions, that he had done nothing,
that he had perfectly, that he had adjusted well to Wallkill
and was participating fully and had never been any problem
and in spite of the fact that they had made a mistake about
what they claimed required the transfer, he was still trans­
ferred.

And, of course, this could happen today and tomorrow
as well.
QUESTION:
responses.

I was a little puzzled by one of your

You suggested, I think in answer to Mr. Justice

'Stewart, that if they decided that the

last 300 prisoners

in would be the ones transferred, or the first 300 in _ just
an arbitrary classification, that that would be all right.
Now, is there any rational basis for that?
Or, what is the rational basis for that kind of
decision?
MR. POCHODA:

Well, in the first place, I meant to

say that it would be all right in terms of. It would not be
a necessity for procedural due process.
I should also add by the x?ay that, in light of the
overextension as characterized by the Petitioners, this

52

particular holding does not concern great numbers of inmates
and does not concern hundreds of people, that only 18 people,
one person per month was transferred from Wallkill involun­
tarily to a maximum-security institution.
We are not talking about great numbers and we
should await — we agree that this Court should await and
not make a decision without other types of hypothetical,
about transfers between institutions or initial placement
until those facts are before the Court.
But we feel that there would be leeway in
deciding in a situation like that, that that is a rational,
that is a reasonable plans in terms of penological and
administrative considerations, that the first 300 or even
the last 300

should be removed if necessary —- that has

-

never been necessary in New York State, but that would not
bring into play procedural due process in each.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

VEry well.

Mr. Hoffman, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HILLEL J. HOFFMAN, ESQ.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes, I'd like to respond to a few

points that were made.
First, at the trial I asked Mr. Newkirk on crossexamination if he was ever placed In special housing and
this appears at page 37a of the Appendix.
Mr. Newkirk testified that he was not placed in

53
special housing and that he did not receive any loss of
good behavior allowances.
Secondly, the concern that we have —
QUESTION:

That meant, when he went to Clinton?

MR. HOFFMAN:

At the receiving — yes, at the

receiving institution.
QUESTION:

Special housing would be —

MR. HOFFMAN:
QUESTION:

Would be the segregation units.

Segregation unit.

MR. HOFFMAN:

He was placed in an idle company

until they found a job for him which meant that he kept in
his own cell and that he was released for one hour a day
for recreation but he was not into the segregation unit at
Clinton.
QUESTION:

He was just segregated in the cell all

by himself.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, there may be other inmates

who are
QUESTION:

That’s net segregation?

MR. HOFFMAN:

No, because he is in with the rest

of the prison population and there may

be other incoming

inmates on that gallery.
QUESTION:

All the others are In separate cells?

MR. HOFFMAN:

Each inmate is In his own cell.

when he is on a reception --

And

54
QUESTION:

How long Is he there for that, 2 3 hours

a day?
MR. HOFFMAN:

It depends — I think in this case

the testimony was that he was there for approximately a
month.

It depends on how long the institution takes to

classify him.
QUESTION:

What Is the difference between that and

solitary confinement?
MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, solitary confinement, he Is

completely removed from the population and there may be no
one else in the solitary confinement unit.
QUESTION:

Well, wasn't he completely removed for

23 hours a day?
MR. HOFFMAN:

No, because there is a great deal

of activity on these galleries and there are people that
pass by the cells.
QUESTION:

I thought you said he was in the cell

by himself?
MR. HOFFMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, but he is not —

Well, if he is by himself, he is in

isolation.
MR. HOFFMAN:
always

Well, a New York State inmate is

in a cell by himself.
QUESTION:

We —

What, for 23 hours a day?

MR. HOFFMAN:

No, not

23 hours a day, but inmates

55

are always confined in single cells in New York.
When he is in reception status, there are other
inmates on the gallery and there are officers and guards -QUESTION:
Wallkill?

Well, were they in separate cells at

Of a certainty they were not.
MR. HOFFMAN:

cells.

No, at Wallkill they didn't have

They had rooms.
QUESTION:

That’s right.

MR. HOFFMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

So it was different.

MR. HOFFMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

I know.

Yes, it was different.

For one month, at least, it was

different.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes.

But he was treated in the same

way that any incoming inmate would have been treated at
Clinton.
QUESTION:

Did they have solitary at Wallkill?

‘ MR. HOFFMAN:
QUESTION:

No.

No, they don't.

Do they have isolation there?

MR. HOFFMAN:

They have a hospital unit where in

an emergency they can put someone for a day or two but they
don’t have a solitary confinement unit.
QUESTION:

So if you do something at Wallkill that

deserves isolation, the only way to do it is transfer them
to Clinton.

Is that right?

56
MR. HOFFMAN:

In many situations.

On occasion

they will use the hospital rooms if an inmate is violent or
in order to calm someone down.

But if the inmate is a

troublemaker or if there is a real threat of violence, they
must move him to another Institution.
The language in the Second

Circuit that we are

concerned about appears at pages 26 and 27 of our petition
for certiorari and there the court speaks about the substan­
tial loss that was suffered as a result of the transfer and
the Second Circuit makes it clear that even though this
transfer may have been outside of the disciplinary process,
that it is the substantial loss suffered by the inmate that
requires the due process procedures and we think that this
rule could apply to any type of classification case where
a man is sent from medium to maximum or minimum to medium
for whatever reason.
Now, in a system of 24 institutions and 15,000
inmates, we cannot possibly avoid errors in every case but
we think that the likelihood that an

error may be committed

in an individual case is — is not so great that these
procedures should be invoked in, perhaps, thousands of
transfers per year.
We also think that the Haymes case is an example
of the next logical step in this process xtfhere the Second
Circuit ruled that if there was a punitive motive, even if

57
a man went between maximum security institutions, that he
would be entitled to a hearing and,there again, they stress
the distances involved and the possible los3 of privileges
that the man may have suffered as the result of going between
these two institutions.
Now, in point of fact, there are no two institutions
in New York that are exactly alike and a man may be moved
from Green Haven to Clinton

or from Auburn to Attica for

programmatic reasons having nothing to do with his conduct
and he may lose the job that he enjoyed.
educational program that he enjoyed.

He may lose an

He may be farther from

his family, but we don't think that all of these transfers
require due process hearings and under the rationale of the
Second Circuit where due process is measured only by the
loss experienced by the inmate, then I think, legally, we
would be required to give hearings in this situation.
QUESTION:

Under the prison rules — or, do the

prison rules expressly say that for certain kinds of conduct,
transfer is an appropriate sanction?
MR. HOFFMAN:

No, they don't.

As a matter of fact,

the Court of Appeals struck out that requirement in the
District Court's order because the Court of Appeals believed
that it would be impossible to specify all of the situations
that might lead to a transfer.
QUESTION:

Well —

58
QUESTION:

Justice White’s question was about the

prison rules, not about the District Court judgment.
MR. HOFFMAN:

No, there is nothing in the prison

rules.
QUESTION:

Was there ever?

MR. HOFFMAN:
QUESTION:

No, there was not.

But you did have prison rules defining

what kind of sanctions would be imposed for certain kinds of
conduct?
MR. HOFFMAN:

We have departmental regulations

which list — we have adjustment committee hearings and we
have formal disciplinary hearings and they list the dis­
positions that an inmate can receive as a result of those
hearings.
QUESTION:

Well, does that suggest that — that

transfer Is not a type of punishment under the rules?
MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, the rules do provide for a

program change that could be interpreted as a transfer, but
the department’s policy Is not to use transfers as —
QUESTION:

Well, you told me that before.

MR. HOFFMAN:
QUESTION:

But —

Yes.

Again, I — the rules purport to say

if you engage in certain kinds of conduct, here is what
might happen to you and your rules don't say that —* that a
transfer is imposed for engaging in those kinds of conduct.

59
MR. HOFFMAN:
Yes.

That is correct.

That is correct.

They do not.
QUESTION:

I am still surprised you don’t just say

that there isn’t any such thing as a disciplinary transfer in
the prisons of New York.
MR. HOFFMAN:
QUESTION:

Well, we did say —

There are a lot of transfers, but it

just is not for discipline.
MR. HOFFMAN:

We did say that, but the Court of

Appeals very flatly rejected that assertion.
QUESTION:

I know, but you say — I thought, aivhile

aS°> you said, yes, there are disciplinary transfers.
MR. HOFFMAN:
QUESTION:

No.

You are trying to get away from them,

but you said there are some.
MR. HOFFMAN:

No.

I said it was conceivable that,

if you interpret a program change as a transfer to another
institution, there could be one but in that case the man
would have to be given formal notice of charges.
But in practice, no, we don’t have disciplinary
transfers.

In that respect we differ, I believe, from the

federal system.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hoffman.

MR. HOFFMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

In New York, when a judge sentences a

60

convicted person, does he designate the prison to which he
shall be sent?
MR. HOFFMAN:No, he — unless it is a special case,
for example, a juvenile offender where he might go to a
reformatory, but other than that, he is merely remanded to
the Department of Corrections.
QUESTIONS:

And the Department of Corrections

makes a judgment as to where he should be confined,
MR. HOFFMAN:

That is correct.

The judgment is

made at a classification and intake center.

And even in

that process, a man may go back and forth between insti­
tutions .
For example, a man may be received at Green Haven
and be sent to Sing Sing for a month for classifcation and
then go back to Green Haven or go to Clinton or go to
Attica and all of these institutions do have some differences
and that is what we are concerned about here, that if the
measure of due process is the loss of privileges or the
distance from the place of conviction, then the possibilities
of hearings are endless in these cases.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:05 o'clock a.m., the case was
submitted.]
