MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Frey, you may

proceed with United States against George J. Wilson.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FREY;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case is here on the government's petition for
writ of certiorari to review a judgment of the Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit, dismissing the government's
appeal from the judgment of the District Court in -this case,
which, after a jury verdict of guilty, dismissed respondent’s
indictment because of allegedly prejudicial pre-indictment
delay.
Respondent was the financial secretary and business
manager of a union local in Pennsylvania.
The indictment charged that he had converted
approximately $1200 in funds belonging to the union for the
purpose of paying the cost of his daughter’s wedding
recaption in 1366*
This payment was made by a check issued by two
officers of the union, Brinker and Schaefer.

Brinker died

in 1368, before the investigations of respondent’s
activities by the FBI was very far along.
By the time the indictment was returned in this

case,, in 1971, Schaefer was terminally ill and he was un­
available to testify at respondent’s trial.
On the basis of the unavailability of Messrs.
Schaefer and Brisker, respondent twice moved before trial for
dismissal of -clue charges against him.

Hearing ware held on

both, these motions, and the evidence on behalf of the
government at these hearings showed that Schaefer and Brinksr
had no active role in the union’s business affairs, that
their signatures on union checks were a routine perfunctory
matter.
Respondent, on the other hand, testified that he had
never directed anyone to prepare the check or to use union
funds to pay for his daughter’s wedding.
After each hearing the District Court denied
respondent's motion to dismiss.

At trial, respondent moved

for a judgment of acquittal, which was denied, and the case
was submitted to the jury, which returned a guilty verdict.
Respondent then renewed his motion for judgment of
acquittal; it was again denied.
Thereafter, respondent filed further post-trial
motions, again asking for acquittal and also for arrest of
judgment and a new trial.
Each motion was based, in part, on his contention
regarding the pre-indictment delay.
Three weeks after 'the filing of these motions,

5
the District Court entered an order dismissing the indictment,
on the grounds of prejudicial pre-indictment delay.
It did so without alluding to its previous actions,
denying the same motions prior to trial, but stating that it
had taken notice of the facts brought out in the testimony
of the case concerning the potential testimony of Mr.
Schaefer.
Since we believe that the District Court had erred
in its legal conclusion, that there was an unreasonable
delay depriving respondent of his opportunity for a fair
trial, and that this was in violation of the due process
clause of the Fifth Amendment, an appeal to the Third Circuit
was authorised.
The Court of Appeals initially entered an order
dismissing the appeal and citing Sisson and claiming that
the appeal was not permissible under the statute.
Consequently we filed a petition for rehearing,
and also in the event there was some statutory problem in
their view, they petitioned for mandamus in the alternative,
relying on the Pooling case in the Second Circuit.
Rehearing was denied, and this time the Court of
Appeals issued an opinion,

it agreed that there was no

statutory impediment to appeal, leaving aside, of course,
the statute's incorporation of any constitutional restriction.,
It concluded that the appeal was constitutionally barred,

o

because the action of the trial court was an acquittal, and
because acquittals could not, in its view, be appealed
consistently with the double jeopardy clause.
In concluding that the action of the District Court
was an acquittal, the Court of Appeals relied on

the definition

of the term in Sisson, where, by the way, it was being
defined for the purpose of determining a question of appealability under former Section 3731.
That definition is

%

the trial judge's disposition

is an acquittal if it is a legal determination on the basis
of facts adduced at trial relating to the general issue of the
case.
The Court of Appeals said that -tine determination made
by the District Court here was based on facts adduced at
trial, which we don't dispute, and that these facts related
to the general issue of the case,

tod that therefore, sines

it was based on facts adduced at trial which related to the
general issue of the case, it was an acquittal, even though
the determination itself had nothing to do v?ith the general
issue of the case.
Now, the case poses two questions, one which we
begem discussing this morning in the Jenkins case, -that is,
assuming that -this is characterised as an acquittal properly
by the Court of Appeals, does that bar our recourse to
appellate review?

7
And secondly, the question of whether, if -chat is
the case, was it properly so characterized?
Now, I'd like to deal further with -the first issue,
if I may, which we were discussing this morning.
I think the Court has to look at this question
which, as I’ve indicated, is a matter of first impression
here, and it has to consider what it is that the government
is asking to have done, and what the interests are of the
systemof public justice on the one hand, and the legitimate
interests of the defendant, that the Constitution recognizes
and seeks to protect, on the other hand.
Now, we submit that there is no articulable value,
there is no rational constitutional policy that is dis­
served by allowing government appeals in circumstances such
as those presented by this case.
If the government appeal fails, that is, if we’re
wrong on the merits and the District Court was right, than
the judgment is affirmed and the defendant is finally
discharged, and the matter is concluded.
On the other hand, if it succeeds, the trial
court is simply required to attach to the trial that has
already taken placa, the correct legal consequences.
Now,

but none of the values which the double

jeopardy clause is designed to serve are impaired by our —
QUESTION;

In this case, Mr. Prey, could that be

8
done by simply reinstating the guilty verdict and entering
judgment on it?
HR. FREY;

Well — yes, you would direct the

District Court, presumably, if it was wrong in its ruling, to
enter a judgment on the verdict.
How, of course there may be — again, there may foe
other post-trial motions which the District Court would wish
to consider before entering

e

final judgment, such as a motion

for a new trial, which he never reached, because of the
grounds on which he concluded the case.
But it's perfectly clear, it seems to me, that the
jury has found the facts and has found them favorably to the
government.
And in this sense the situation is not as
different — we're not contending that we're in a materially
stronger position in tills case than we would be in the Jenkins
case, although one could possibly seek to make a distinction
between jury and non-jury trials.
In the Jenkins case, the judge acted in two functions
he performed the jury's function as a finder of fact, and he
performed his judicial function, and it's -there that he went
wrong and it was his error in performing the judicial
function —

Presumably.

It’s not clear what ha

I don't think that there was a motion for

dismissal of the indictment as such, but that is the relief
that he granted.
Of course f under Rule 12 he was required to
consider and act on that prior to trial, and he did consider
and act on it prior to trial and deny it, and there's some
question about his power sulsequent to trial to reopen that
matter, or \v’hether, if he’s once denied it prior to trial,
only the appellate court, in our view, would have —

MR. FREY:

of course, once

he's entered a judgment, then his power to act with respect to

It then becomes subject

to appellate review.
QUESTION:

Well, he can entertain a motion for a

I think — yes, -there are certain forms

of relief that he can — teat he can grant.
In the Green case, Mr. Justice Black discussed some
of the policies of the double jeopardy clause, the interests
that are served that we say at not adversely affected by a <■
government appeal here.
He begins at page 187 of 355 U.5., by skying:
The constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy was
designed to protect an individual from being subjected to the
hazards of trial and possible conviction more than once for
an alleged offense.
Then, after quoting from Blackstone and from Ex Parts
Lang, he said;

The underlying idea, one that is deeply

11
ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of juris­
prudence is til at the State with all its resources and power
should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict
an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting
him to embarrassment and expanse and ordeal and compelling
him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity,
as well as enhancing the possibility that, even though
innocent, he may be found guilty.
Now, we submit that these interests are not at
stake in the government's appeal in this case.

That what

Justice Black was clearly talking about was ‘the situation
in the Ball case and in cases of that sort.
Now, also I note that even in the context of a
second trial, following a legally erroneous acquittal,
Mr. Justice Cardoso observed in Palko v. Connecticut — and
here I refer to Palko because of its relevance to the
constitutional policies that are at stake here — the State
is not attempting to wear the accused out by a multitude
of cases with accumulated trials

it asks no more than

this, that the case against him shall go on until there
shall be a trial free from the corrosion of substantial
legal error.

This is not cruelty at all, nor even vexation

in any immoderate degree.
QUESTION:

Of course, Palko in effect said you

could have a rational system of jurisprudence without the

12
double jeopardy clause, din’fc it?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. PREY:

Well, it said that the core value of

the double jeopardy clause that would be transmitted to the
States under the notion of Palko through the due process
clause vrould be basically the Sail notion, that a man who has
been tried and acquitted on the facts can't be subjected to
a second prosecution.
QUESTION:

But, even

if Palko was still law,

we would be dealing in the federal system, as we are hero,
not with the core notion but with the double jeopardy clause
itself.
MR. PREY:

Yes, I understand that, and I don’t

mean to suggest, in alluding to Palko, that he meant to
exclude the possibility of other considerations.

Because one

of the things that happened in the Palko opinion was that he
discussed Keener, and in discussing Kenner, he — tha Court
refrained from overruling Kepner, but it did clearly
indicate in its discussion that it had a great deal of
sympathy for Justice Holmes’ views in Kepner.
Now, the Court could have decided Palko by over­
ruling Kepner, it instead took the course of saying that, to
•the extent Kepner imposes more than this core notion, adds
more to the double jeopardy clause than this core notion, that
added ingredient is not applicable to the States through 'the

due process clause.
And, of course, in Benton v. Maryland, in which
Palko was overruled, as Justice Harlan pointed out in
dissent, what Maryland had tried to do came within this
core notion, and the case could have been decided

on due

process grounds, what Maryland did was indefensible even
on those grounds.
Now, the result reached by the Court of Appeals
in this case, if enshrined as a constitutional holding by this
Court, will create serious illogicalities and will be
wholly inconsistent with recognised lav; in other related
instances.
I think the clearest instance that comes to mind
is the instance of Supreme Court review of acquittals by
Courts of Appeals.
Let's take, for instance, the Russell case, which
this Court decided two terras ago.

The defendant was

convicted and he appealed to the Court of Appeals.

The

Court of Appeals ex anined the evidence that was adduced at
trial relating to the general issue, and it found, on the
basis of that evidence, that a government agent had supplied
the necessary ingredient for the manufacture of the
controlled substance.
It held, applying an erroneous legal standard, that
on those, facts there was entrapment and the defendant was

14
entitled to acquittal.
How, if an acquittal is not appealable, then I do
not understand by what means we were able to take the
Russell case to the Supreme Court and get a reversal.
QUESTIONs Well, of course, the acquittal came in
the Court of Appeals in Russell, not in the District Court.
MR. FRSYs

That's true, but of course the Court of

Appeals was performing the identical function in Russell that
the District Judge was performing here in the Wilson case.
That is, ruling on a question of law.
It was to the jury was committed the responsibility
of finding the facts.
What the judge did here was indistinguishable in
terms of any functional analysis, from what the Court of
Appeals did in Russell.
I mean, in fact the logic would be that if the
District Court himself, after having taken this action —
suppose we cams along with an opinion of the Court of
Appeals the next morning?

Suppose, in Jenkins, Mercado had

been decided the following morning, and we had gone back to
Judge Travia and said3 Well, see, you’ve made a mistake.
And he says, That’s right, I’ve made a mistake? I reconsider,
I withdraw my prior order and I enter a judgment of conviction.
Presumably that would, under the analysis of the
respondents in these cases, that would violate the double

jeopardy clause.
QUESTION: Then you think that if the judge acquitted
the man on illegal grounds or unconstitutional grounds, that
the Court of Appeals could reinstate it now; is that where
you're going to end up?
MR. PREY:

In a jury trial or in a —

QUESTION:

Either.

MR. PREY:

Well, in a jury trial, there’s no

doubt that the Court of Appeals could, in our view, could
order him to enter a judgment of conviction.

Assuming

there is no other matter before him that would prevent the
judgment of conviction.
QUESTION:

You’re back to the directed verdict

MR. PREY;

Well, the jury — it’s not a directed

again.

verdict.

In the case of a directed verdict, you're dealing

with the defendant's and government's constitutional right
to ajury trial.

You cannot direct a verdict of guilty,

because that would defeat the right to the jury trial.
The reason why you can't direct a verdict of
guilty has nothing to do with double jeopardy, it has to do
with the jury trial protection.
QUESTION;

Do you know of any case where the

Court of Appeals has ordered a trial judge, sitting without
a jury, to find a man guilty?

MR. FREY;

Well * I'm not sure

QUESTION;

Of course there's no such case.

ME. FREY:

You mean where he's found him not

QUESTION:

Yeahl

guilty?

MR. FREY: Well, you have to realise, this case here,
these cases this morning, ara basically cases of first
impression, so to say that there is no such case — I mean,
there may be no such case because there has been no litigation
in this area, because there has been no power of the
government to appeal in such circumstances.
QUESTION:

And there might still be no such case.

MR. FREY:

When the defendant — well, there may.

That's, of course, up to you.
When the defendant waives a jury trial, he waives
his right to have an irrational verdict rendered in his
behalf, ha submits himself to the hands of the judge
QUESTION:

When he waived the jury trial, he

didn't waive the double jeopardy plea.
MR. FREY:

No, ci course not.

Of course not. We're

not suggesting that he waive the double jeopardy clause.
QUESTION;

Yes, you are —- pretty close.

MR. FREY:

We're suggesting that different

consequences attach.
Now, in the case of the respondent Wilson, he had

17
a juri* trial.

The jury found the facts that would support a

conviction. The judge clearly applied to those facts a
proposition of law, which we submit is erroneous.
And the question is whether we can correct the
legal determination.

That has nothing to do with disturbing

the —
QUESTION;

Suppose he were granted a new trial,

could you appeal that?
MR. FREY;

No.

First of all, the statute does not

authorise us, and, secondly, it's discretionary.
But if there were a statute authorising it, the
Supreme Court of New Jersey has held, in a case called
State v. Sims, in 322 A. 2d, that there is no constitutional
impediment to a —
QUESTION;

You better stick on the statute,

instead of discretion.
MR. FREY;

Excuse me?

QUESTION;

I think you'd better stick on the

statute, instead of discretion.
MR. FREY;

Well, the statute confides it to the

discretion, in that the appeal statute does not authorise
appeals.

So, of course — but that's, it seems to me, a

different point.
The jury performed the function it was supposed to
perform here, and it found respondent Wilson guilty.

18
It found all the facts.
QUESTIONt

Is the government suggesting, in any

respect, that we cut back on Sisson?
MR. FREY:

Well, .1 was going to turn now to a

specific discussion on that.
QUESTIONs

All right.

Before you do that, let me

ask another question.
Suppose there is a guilty verdict, and it’s over­
turned by the Court of Appeals on the — or by the court,
•the District Court, on the basis of insufficiency of the
evidence.

Is that a determination of fact or of law?
MR. FREY:

It’s a determination of law, clearly.

It's the kind of determination that appellate courts make
every day.

Suppose he refused to overturn it, oh the

grounds of insufficiency of the evidence, and the case were
appealed to the Court of Appeals?

And it disagreed with him.

It could only do so as a matter of law.
I think there's some confusion that's introduced
here by the fact-law discussion.
questions of law.

Courts of Appeals decide

Now, sometimes those questions of law

relate to whether a particular fact has been established at
the trial of the case.
But it is a question of law as to whether that
fact has been established sufficiently to permit its
acceptance,

19

Sc that I tliink it’s misleading to gat into a factlaw analysis.

We are only asking, and by the nature of the

appellate process could only be asking,» for the right to
raise questions of law in the appellate court.
Now, in the case of United States v. Bally which
is the first of the four cases that we have to deal with in
this Court, the defendant was acquitted by the jury in a
trial that was free from any error adversely affecting the
defendant's interest.
Co-defendants x-dio were convicted appealed and the
conviction was reversed by this Court for an insufficiency
of the indictment.
Thereafter, Ball and his co-defendants were retried.
All three convicted.

All three sentenced to death.

On their appeals to the Supreme Court, this Court held quite
rightly, in a holding with which we have no quarrel whatsoever,
that Mr. Ball's acquittal had become final, that there was
3impiy no way that he could be tried a second time; the
jury having once found him not guilty.
Mow, in the course of so doing, the Court uttered
a dictum which is one of our problems in this case.

It

said —
QUESTION:

Where are you reading from now?

MR. FREY:

I'm reading from page 28 of our brief in

Jenkins, which would be page 671 of 163 U.S., the Ball case.

20

It said:

As to the defendant who has been

acquitted by the verdict duly returned and received, the
Court could take no other action than to order his discharge.
The verdict of acquittal was final, and could not be reviewed
on error or otherwise, without putting him twice in jeopardy,
and thereby violating the Constitution.
Now, of course, nobody was trying to review the
verdict of acquittal of Mr. Ball by writ of error, and so
that the statement is clearly the sheerest dictum.
In addition, the statement focuses on a verdict of
acquittal.

In the Wilson case, indeed in the Jenkins case,

we submit that we are not contesting a verdict of acquittal,
but, rather, a judgment that has the effect of an acquittal,
and we think that’s rather a different thing.
Now, the next cases to come along was Sisson in
1904 — Kepner, excuse me.

<

In the Kepner case, what happened was that the
defendant was tried in the Philippines in the court of first
instance, and I think it's instructive to see exactly what
was before this Court in Kepner.
The — I'm now referring to the record in the Kepner
case, at page 3, there is the decision of the Court of First
Instance.

And what the Court of First Instance found is

that in this- case there is evidence tending to show that the
money which respondent is charged with unlawfully converting

was in fact appropriated by him under a bona fide claim of
right.
And then he said:

On the whole I think this

evidence is of sufficient weight to raise a reasonable doubt
as to the existence of a fraudulent intent, which is an
essential element of the offense.

I therefore find the

respondent not guilty.
Now, under the Philippine practice then in effect,
the government appealed to the Supreme Court of trie
Philippines.

It did not allege errors of law in the trial

of the case.

It said that the judge of the Court of First

Instance had made a mistake when he concluded that he had a
reasonable doubt about Kepner's fraudulent intent.
And the Court of Appeals, or the Supreme Court of
the Philippines, whose opinion is also reproduced here,
stated quite clearly that it did not, on the evidence,
believe Mr. Kepner’s story.
Well, when this case reached the Supreme Court, the
conclusion of the Court, although there is a lengthy
discussion of the general subject of appeals, the conclusion
of the Court is with reference to 'the Ball case.
It establishes that to try a man

It says:

I'm now looking at page

30 of our brief in Jenkins — to try a man after a verdict of
acquittal is to put him twice in jeopardy, although the
verdict was not followed by judgment.

22
This, said the Supreme Court in Kepner, is
practically the case under consideration, viewed in the most
favorable aspect for the government.

The court of first

instance, having jurisdiction to try the question of the
guilt or innocence of the accused, found Kepner not guilty;
to try him again upon the merits, even in an appellate court,
is to put him a second time in jeopardy for the same
offense.
Nov;, we here are not asking to try Mr. Wilson or
to try Mr. Jenkins again upon the merits in an appellate
court.
QUESTION:

You say the rationale in Kepner was it

would have to have a new trial?
MR. PREY:

Not that you would have to have a new

trial, but that in fact the second proceeding was a new trial
that was constitutionally prohibitive.
Mi at had happened was the court of first
instance had acquitted on a factual determination of reasonable
doubt about fraudulent intent.
QUESTION;

Unh-hunih.

MR. FREY: The Supreme Court of the Philippines
reviewed the evidence in great detail, and said: We think
that Mr. Kepner1s story is not credible, we don't think he
should have been believed by the court of first instance.
And therefore we find him guilty.

QUESTION 3

Unh-hunh.

MR. FREY:

Now, it wasn't a second trial in the

sense that there was formal evidence adduced, it was a
review of the record.
QUESTION:

But to go further, if -the Supreme

Court of the Philippines' judgment had been sustained, it
would have been no need for a new trial.
MR, FREY:
-— no.

If they had — if it had been sustained

The issue was that *—
QUESTION:

Because, under the Philippine practice,

as Judge Friendly said, no further proceedings were
required by law.
MR. FREY:

But this is a case —

QUESTION:

But even so, there would have been —

•there was double jeopardy .
QUESTION:

Because the question there was whether

the second trial that he had already had put him in double
jeopardy.

It's like the Jorn

case in -the sense that the

question in Jorn was not whether -the appeal in Jorn would
place him in double jeopardy, but whether to have proceeded
with the trial in Jorn would have placed him in double
jeopardy.
And what -the Supreme Court basically held hare
was that to retry him, even in a court that you would call an
appellate court, is not permissible under Ball.

24
Nowt X see 1 have very little time left.
With raspec t to Sisson» w® don’t, in these cases 9
try to maintain that Sisson is distinguishable — oh, let
me say one more thing about Kepner.
Kepnsr is not a holding of this Court.

It was —

it involved a Philippines Act, and in Green,as Mr. Justice
?

Douglas said in his dissent in Hogue v, New Jersey? it is
not binding precedent on this Court.
In Sisson, we believe that Sisson is on all fours.
The difference is that Sisson was interpreting the old
Criminal Appeals Act, and we suggest that the statement —
QUESTION?
Mr. Frey.

I didn't hear what you. said there,

You believe that Sisson is what?
MR. FREYs

We think it’s on all fours, analytically.

That is, in the Hankins case, we agree that if Sisson was
right in its definition of an acquittal for purposes of
old 373.1, that in Jenkins you had the same beast.
Now, we don't agree in Wilson that you had the
same beast, for reasons that I’m not going to be able to get
to, but are addressed at length in our brief.
But we say that the determination in Sisson, the
statement which was one paragraph in the course of a lengthy
and complicated opinion, and which Mr. Justice White noted
in his dissent, he didn't believe the Court could seriously
mean as a constitutional holding, we think that that dictum

25

ought not to be followed by this Court.
And I would note -that the dictum came about in a
case which, as Justice Harlan himself noted in Sisson, the
argument was exclusively addressed to the constitutional
issues, the Court did not — excuse me, to the statutory
issues.

The Court did not have the constitutional question

even argued before it.
So that I think an offhand comment unnecessary to
the decision should not be given any weight in concluding
this very important issue, and that you should look at it
afresh.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Very well, Mr. Frey.

Mr. Lauar.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP D. LAUER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. LAUERMr. Chief Justice, and if it please
the Courts
It's the opinion of the petitioner — I'm sorry;
it's the submission of the respondent in this matter, and
I understand it to have been the submission of the
respondent in the matter heard by you just previously, that
the position of the government would require, if accepted
by you, a holding that would foe too narrow on double
jeopardy grounds for reasonable application in all cases.

26

We. have heard this morning, and again this afternoon,
of the government's feeling that in this- particular case and
in the Jenkins case which preceded it, that you could, in
effect, allow an appeal, despite the provisions of the
double jeopardy clause, for several reasons„
First, they present to you the proposition that to
do so would not violate — or actually would not even
implicate double jeopardy clausa, because there would b®
no retrial.
Prior to following that through, if I may I'd like
to recite,however, something before it slips away from me
altogether.
There is, I think, one other fact that I would like
to acid to the factual discussion made thus far by Mr. Frey,
and that is that in its review, in its order of court which
took the form of a memorandum opinion, the District Judge
referred extensively, we submit, to trial testimony. And I
think that that is important for reasons which I will try to
develop during the course of this argument; namely, that, the
judge did not simply, as is 'urged in the brief of the
petitioner, rely upon facts which were found at a pretrial
hearing.

And we also submit that, it's impossible to

intelligently find that the facts at that pretrial hearing
were the same facts which were ultimately found, or which were
ultimately presented at the. time of trial.

27
It's oar opinion, and we have set it forth in the
brief, I believe in soma detail, that the facts taken at
the trial and -the facts upon which the Court relied in its
opinion were considerably greater in volume, considerably
mere varied at the time of trial.
It also seems apparent
this

and I will come back to

it seems apparent that the District Judge, prior to

trial, having heard this argument and heard some testimony
on two occasions, concluded on both of those occasions that
there were not facts, at least which were satisfactory to
him, to warrant consideration, favorab le consideration of
our pretrial motion.
However, and this is intimated in the petitioner's
brief, he must have changed his mind for some reason? and
the government would conclude that it was simply a change
of mind.
QUESTION;
finding of guilt

Did that have anything to do with the

or innocence?

MR. LATJER:

Did the judge's ruling have anything

at all to do vith the finding of guilt or innocence?

Yes,

sir, I believe it did.

I would say to you, first of all, that I do not
telieve that it is the classical kind cf decision which
says specifically we do not

Relieve the evidence in this

case to have been sufficient to warrant a judgment of con-

28
vietion.
QUESTION:

I mean, did it say anything about guilt

or innocence?
MR. LAUER:

Yes, 1 believe it did»

It said it

in this context -QUESTION:
MR. LAUERs

I’m listening.

I'm listening.

Okay.

1' believe it did, in this context.

I believe that

it discussed the question in very brief terras, admittedly,

of whether or not the testimony of the individuals whose
absence was challenged by the respondent in this matter
would have bean — would have been a subject of some import
in making the determination as to guilt or innocence.
But it did not specifically male© that determination, no, sir.
QUESTION:

Didn't touch it at all, did it?

Didn't have anything to do with it.
It just said, regardless of the finding of guilt
or innocence, I find that this cannot stand.

That's what it

says
MR. LAURRs

That’s correct.

1 believe that to be

substantially correct,but. I don’t believe that that disposes,
if Your Honor please, of the question of whether or not the
order constituted an acquittal.
QUESTION:

Isn’t the implication, however, of the

judge's action that had there not been this delay the jury

29

verdict might well have been different; might well have been
not guilty.
MR. LAUER:
previously.

Yes.

This is what I was suggesting

But he did not, himself, find that the jury

verdict should have been one or the other. But it's clear
from his opinion, and it’s even clearer, I would submit,
upon a careful reading of the record and the record papers,
that what is in issue, or what was in issue before the
District Judge at that, point is whether the outcome would
have been substantially affected by the presence or absence
of peopJ.e, we submit, would have been available had not the
government substantially —
QUESTIONt

And the finding of substantial

prejudice is simply a way of saying that had the trial been
conducted more promptly, the result might well have been
different.
It has to be that, doesn't it?
MR. LAUER;

That is our position, sir.

QUESTION;

And if it had been different, it would

have been a verdict of not guilty rather than a verdict of
guilty.

So, to that extent, it does have something to do

with the guilt or innocence, doesn't it?
MR. LAUER;

Yes, sir.

We believe that it —

well, yes, it has a lot to do with it, but it does not, as
Mr. Justice Marshall was saying, it does not specifically

30
make that finding.
QUESTION:

Well, he doesn’t know what these

witnesses would have testified.

How could he make any such

finding?
MR. LAUER:
QUESTION;
MR. LAUER;
QUESTION;

Correct.
One was dead, and the other was —*
Well, I think perhaps —
*■— under such a disability that he

couldn't testify; isn't -that correct?
MR. LAUER;

Yes, sir.

I think that perhaps what he could have done is
assume — and did not do, incidentally — could have perhaps
assumed that the witness would have spoken in terns similar
to those presented by us in our argument and in our papers,
and made a determination on that basis.
But it clearly would not have been a fit basis for
disposing of the action in the —
QUESTION; But the ruling really is that he should
never have bean tried at all.

QUESTION;

That's correct.
And couldn't be tried again, and, hence,

1 think that *—
The ruling is that he should never have

MR. LAUER:

That's correct.

That’s correct.
QUESTIONs

But. I think that —

And hence — hence, it certainly doesn't

invite any more jeopardy.
MR. LAUER;

All right.

I think that it ~ to

reach that point, you have to retreat,, in my opinion, from
your previous discussion of what constitutes an acquittal,
as formulated in Sisson and subsequently cited with
approval.
Because it’s our position that in getting to this
— well, first of all, it’s obvious that the District Judge
couldn’t, or felt that he could not, make

those kinds of

determinations pretrial.
And that, in fact, in order to make that determina­
tion, he required himself to listen to and consider carefully
all of the evidence in the case.

In fact, logically, it’s the

only way —
QUESTION:

That may be so.

That may be so.

He

may have relied on — he may have — his whole ruling or
consideration of the motion to dismiss for pretrial delay,
he may have been greatly informed by the trial testimony.
MR. LMJER:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

But his ultimate judgment is he never

should have been tried at all.
MR. LAUER;

Based upon facts which he didn’t learn

32
until he was tried, that's correct.
That's substantially correct.

That he should

probably not have — not "probably” —* that he should not
have been tried, and could not again be fairly tried on -die
basis of the prejudice.
QUESTION:
MR. LAUERs

Those facts rsaX3.y went to prejudice.
The facts did go to prejudice, yes,

sir.
QUESTION:
MR. LAUERs
QUESTION:

I mean, what finally determined him?
Oh, are you asking me?
That he was denied a speedy trial.

What finally determined the judge that he had been denied a
speedy trial?

Was that not having this evidence available,

his trial was prejudiced.
MR. LAUER:
QUESTION:
MR. LAUERs
QUESTION:

Correct.
Wasn’t that it?
Correct.
And that's the connection with the fact

finding.
MR. LAUER:

That is tin® connection with -the fact™

finding, yes.
My point is that that kind of fact-finding —
I’m sorry? that kind of decision, based upon that kind of
fact-finding, could not bs made in a case such as this one,
until in fact the trial had been complete.

By reason of the

33
-- it could have been made pretrial if a judge was willing,
if I may characterize it this way, to stick cut his neck and
say that: On the basis of what I think the government is
going to show, you would have needed these people.
QUESTION z

Well, a speedy trial issue requires a

determination of prejudice, anyway, doesn’t it?
MR. LAUER:

Not the speedy trial issue, but the

due process issue woudl require the determination of
pre j udice, yes, sir.
QUESTION:

Well, this is the type of tiling that

many an experienced trial judge wouldn’t take your word by
affidavit for at a pretrial stage, but sitting through the
evidence may have reached a different conclusion on his own.
MR. LAYER:

That's correct, sir.

We don’t disagree at all with that.

That’s correct.
What we’re

saying, however, is that, to the extent that that kind of
procedure becomes necessary in order for the judge to make
such a decision, and if the facts upon which he's going to
make that decision are facts which go to the general issue
in the case, then that situation is indistinguishable from
the kind of an acquittal that you approve, with dissent of
course, in Sisson.
QUESTION:

I didn't approve.

MR. LAUER:

I'm sorry, Your Honor, I was not

speaking of you personally.

34
Soma of you approved.
That

and it is our --

QUESTION:

True.

MR. LAUER:

That is equally obvious, sir.

And it is our position, however, that to retreat
from that at this point in time and to try to redefine it
would be perhaps, again, to venture into an area where a
definition may not be appropriate.
We think the definition, and we’ve urged this in
our brief, that you, as a body, have previously enunciated,
is appropriate and that, it fairly and accurately and
predictably defines what an acquittal is.
QUESTION:

Don’t you perhaps overstate or go

beyond what you need to go beyond when you say that you
could not demonstrata these things by affidavit.

In a pre-

trial motion, wouldn’t it be more accurate to say that a
judge'is likely to find the demonstration much more graphic
when the case is tried than he would find them from some
affidavits?
MR. LAUER:

If I may, I would not only retreat

from that, I did not mean to say -that we could not have
done it by affidavit.
two pretrial hearings.

In fact, we did it in this case by
We did not do them by affidavit.

But, nonetheless, those hearings, without the
production of all of the government’s testimony, without

'

35
the production of defense testimony having to do with issues
that have to do clearly with items of credibility, really,
is not as persuasive as you have just put it, as a
determination made after having heard all of that.
For instance, in this particular case we had a
pretrial hearing initially, in which the judge denied the
motion from the bench, without any additional consideration.
When we came back for trial, we were informed that
the court was still concerned, and we proceeded to put on
some additional testimony.
Now, as 1 pointed out in the brief, we did not
try the entire case, we didn't have the Serfass case, and
we unfortunately are not a draft, case, where we can talcs a
file and present it to a judge and thereby have him have
everything that the government knows about the case.
There was substantially more in the government's
case.

There was substantially more in our case.
And we would submit that if it requires this

kind of consideration of fundamental facts which go to the
general issue in the case, then we fall right in the middle
of the Sisson definition of an acquittal,

And that this

case is the equivalent of an acquittal under the facts in
this case or under the facts in any case, under the facts
in some of the cases that Mr. Justice Rehnquist has ~™
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that this is a

36

parallel to some extent of the esse where a judge is in doubtas he’s going along, but decides to let the case go to the
jury, get their verdict, and then, with more time to
reflect on the interaction of all the evidence, decides to
enter a judgment n.o.v.; is it something like that?
MR. LAUER:
really.

I think

that ■— no, I don’t think it is,

Because I think that that kind of a decision, as

you've voiced it to m®, or as 1 understand -the question,
involves one where the court has in fact cerebrated about
these very things and decided2 Well, for some reason, I'm
not going to do it at this point; I'll let the jury do it.
I don't think the same kind of reasoning applied
here at all.
I think that for reasons which I am not privy to,
and reasons, incidentally, which support, I believe, our
view as to how an acquittal should be defined, the judge at
that point was not able to conclude what he subsequently
was in fact able to conclude.
And 1 submit that this test previously propounded
here, or something very similar to it, is vitally necessary,
because I think that this Court and -the Circuit Courts are
going to continue to be confronted with situations where there
is a question as to whether or not the judge in fact entered
an. order which is an acquittal or which is a purely legal
ruling, as the court would have you

I’m sorry7 as the

37
petitioner would have you believe, and that without some
kind of predictable formulation of what an acquittal is,
that you’re going to be confronted with thin problem over
and over.
QUESTIONs

Under your argument, though, acquittal

must have significance under the double jeopardy clause,
it no longer has any statutory significance.
MR. LAUERs

That’s correct.

That’s correct.
Well, it has statutory significance in the sense
that the double jeopardy clause is the only thing which
stands between the government and its appeal.
know, clearly that’s begging the question.

But, you

What happens is

you’ve got to get over the hurdle of the double jeopardy
clause in this case or in any other to be able to have
that appeal.
QUESTION: And if you do get over it, you have it,
I take it?
MR. LAUER:

Yes, sir.

I don't see that 1 can

avoid that, taking this position.
We —• if 1 may return to it, at least briefly,
I would like very much to respond to a portion of the earlier
remarks of the petitioner in this matter.
There is the question, as the petitioner has
presented it, of whether simply -«■* well, not simply —

38

whether by reason of the fact that no retrial is required in
this matter P whether the implications of the double jeopardy
clause is avoided,

That's one peg in the line of reasoning

of the petitioner.
And there's further the question of whether or not>
by reason of the fact that it is a clear question of law,
the double jeopardy clause is not implicatede or, rather,
perhaps more accurately, whether it does therefore not become
an acquittal which would implicate the double jeopardy clause.
It's our position that this reading of the double
jeopardy clause is too narrow,

And we would respectfully

submit to this Court that the statement that no trial will
result cannot be dispositive of the double jeopardy issue
ii: this or any other case.
It's been stated in a recent Harvard Law Review
article, that X believe was written sometime after the briefs
in this case war© filed, or at least at about the same time,,
that perhaps in these kinds of cases the question of when
jeopardy attaches is never — is no longer a relevant inquiry,
or at least not a relevant inquiry in this kind of case.
Because it's the kind of inquiry which is very
relevant in cases involving premature mistrials and the Perea
or Illinois v. Somerville cases, but perhaps that's not a
relevant inquiry here.
What we're suggesting to you is that that kind of

39

inquiry is relevant in this particular case for this reasons
We think that there is no question that jeopardy has attached
in Mr. Wilson's case.
Assuming the technical jeopardy terms about which
there was much discussion in Mr. Justice White's dissenting
opinion in Sisson, there's no question we have technical
jeopardy in that a jury was empaneled, and the jury in fact
heard the whole case, rendered a verdict.
What we're suggesting is that upon the granting
of an acquittal, if that's in fact what this order was,
that that jeopardy was thereupon terminated.
at that point in time,

The defendant

was no longer in a position of

jeopardy, and that bringing him back or

after a successful

appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals is once again going
to expose him to the kinds of risk which constitute
jeopardy.
The situation which has developed in this case is
indicative of this, we believe, but we think that it's
important to keep this kind of a test in mind in determining
whether or not double jeopary's principles are going to be
violated.
Now, the government says, Unless you go back for a
trial, the double jeopardy clause will not be implicated,
and you will not be violating the double jeopardy clause.
And we respectfully submit that that is not

sensible, it is not logical, and it does not follow the
double jeopardy clause, and for this reasons
This Court has said, for instance, in Price vs
Georgia, and I believe in the Chief Justice's opinion, as I
recall, that the "twice put in jeopardy" language of the
Constitution thus relates to a potential, i.e., the risk
that an accused for a second time will be convicted of the
same offense for which he was initially tried.
There ara other references in our brief and
elsewhere to the fact

-that although this kind of situation

obviously arises most frequently where there in fact has been
a second trial and perhaps a second conviction, that to
implicate the double jeopardy clause you need not have that
kind of a situation. "
And we would be
QUESTION:

What would be your position, Mr. Lauar,

if the jury returns a verdict or guilty and the judge grants
a post-trial motion, call it for acquittal, call it for

■

dismissing the indictment, on the basis of the statute of
limitations.

Is that appealable by tine government under this

Statute?
MR„ LAUER:

I would say that if it were a statute

of limitations issue, which could have constituted a jury
defense, and if the Court found —QUESTION:

Isn't that ordinarily something that

you charge the jury# about the statute of limitations?
MR. L&UER:

No# no.

I'm saying that if perhaps

-— that it could have formed — there could be a question of
fact.

Well# maybe I'm reading too much in your question.
For instance# what I’m saying is if there were a

question# and I believe that this is dona# if there were a
question as to times, dates# and so forth# and the question
of the statute was submitted to the jury and the court acted
on that kind of information# and, subsequent to the trial#
reversed it on whatever label it decided to use# that I
don't believe that kind of order would be appealable.
QUESTION:

But if -there were no question of fact#

it was simply a question of which statute of limitations
applied# on a jury verdict of guilty and a post-trial
motion granted.
MR. LAUERs

Then I would say that, for the reasons

we've advanced in this case# that if the decision concerned
— not concerned itself? but founded itself upon trial
testimony going to the fundamental issue# in some cases it
would not be appealable.
Now# obviously# where the defendant has initiated
the review# and this is ~~ there are many cases

covering

this # where the defendant has initiated the review himself by
himself asking for a new trial# that is a different
circumstance# because this Court has held — and there are

many other cases thoroughly talking about it, that the
defendant has in effect waived his right to even discuss the
question of double jeopardy»
But if you have a situation not unlike this one,
where the Court, for reasons that ~~ and I think perhaps a
better, perhaps not an example of what you're talking about,
but another kind of issue with which we've very much
concerned, is supposing the trial judge for some reason had
heard the matter perhaps without a jury, and at the
conclusion of all testimony, of the -testimony of the
government, which clearly made out the offense, the defense
rested without presenting any testimony, find the judge
■ thereafter enters a verdict of not guilty.
And ovan an explicated verdict of guilty.
What lJm suggesting to you is that there is —
regardless of how the judge comes to that decision, it's
not -- it's not critical whether or not —• it's not critical
In this discussion whether or not it's labeled anything in
particular.

It is critical, we would submit, whether or not

the defense, through some reason of his own, has waived the
double jeopardy question, or whether you get into a question
of manifest necessity or one of the other reasons why
double jeopardy has been found not to apply.
But we would say that if the defendant, through
none of his conduct, waived it, and if the court, in consider-

43
ing the matter, used trial testimony, used fundamental
issues —- I’m sorry, fundamental testimony in the case, going
to the fundamental issue in the case, then we would submit
that you have a situation where it is not appealable.
QUESTIONz

You waive it by making a post-trial

motion?
MR. LAUER:
it, no.

I don't think that fact alone waives

I think that you waive it where you — where you

make and succeed, perhaps on a post-trial motion, the
essence of which is something not cognizable under double
jeopardy.
I'm talking about you make and succeed on a motion
for new trial.

So obviously if you’re asking for a new

trial, you're not going to ba heard subsequently to make the
double jeopardy claim when the new trial ie heard.
So that I recognise, by the expression on your face,
chat I may not have completely answered your question, but
1 believe that 13 ve expressed our opinion at least that this
kind of a decision by the Court would be non-appealable.
The other area that

think is of substantial

concern -- well, there are a number of them, we feel that
another area of substantial concern is the government's
reliance in the presentation, the submission of the issue to
you, that this is strictly a legal ruling.
that

We don’t believe

44
Ws don’t believe that it is strictly a legal ruling,
and the government

the petitioner in this matter, a few

moments ago, stated to you that we don't think it’s important
or relevant to get involved in a lengthy discussion as a factlaw issue.

And -— or whether or not this is an issue of

law or fact.
But the very fundamental principle that they are
putting to you in this matter is that it is a strictly a
question of law, and that's the reason, if I may submit so,
and if 1 may raise my voice to that extent, that’s the reason
why you're being asked to allow tills matter to go back and
simply correct a pure error of law.
We would submit that that is not the case in this
case, and that it's almost hard to dream of a case where
that is true, although I think some of the examples perhaps
used here this morning may be precisely that.

But that is.,

not the case in the Wilson case, where issues, clear issues
of fact had to be considered in order to arrive at that
question.
The obvious answer to that line of reasoning is,
Well, yes, there were factual matters which held to be
resolved, but in the end, where the judge made his mistake
was the application of the law.
We don't consider it to be that simple, and we
would respectfully submit to this Court that the reasons for

concluding that it's a fundamental and simple error of law
do not exist in this case.
QUESTION:

How do you characterise the cerebrations

of the judge?
MR. LAUER?

I would sav* Mr. Chief Justice,, that

it's probably a mixed question, of law and fact,
QUESTIONS

MR. LAUER:

Yes, I think so, in much the same

warrants an acquittal.

QUESTION:

The same process?

MR. LAUER:

Yes, it’s the same process -chat

one examines facts, one looks at them, weighs them,

examines demeanor of witnesses or whatever, and, based
upon some very fine-tuned kinds of examinations of what has
occurred in front of you, one then applies the given law
to that set of facts.

of legal principles must occur.

I'm not suggesting that the

same teats, legal tests, will apply, certainly.
QUESTIONs
MR. LAUER;

No, no.
But to the extent that both of them

must go on, then clearly you have, in every case, a mixed
question of law and fact, and the only place, the only kind
of case where the government’s particular kind of submission
to you in this case is going to apply is where you have no
question whatever, we would submit, about the facts, but
merely a legal issue which the judge has somehow erroneously

47
concluded.
QUESTION;

To the contrary, I understand the

government's position to be that the only decision on guilt
or innocence was made by the jury, and the judge

and

that, in itself, was one, — for some other reason the
judge upset that.
MR. LATJER:
QUESTIONi

Yes, sir.
Now, how can you say -that one is

law and one is fact?
MR. LAUER:

I don't understand your question, sir,

because I am specifically not saying that one is law and
one is fact.
QUESTIONs

I understand the government to say

that if the judge had ruled that the evidence wasn’t
sufficient, or something of that sort, involving guilt or
innocence, it should be a different ballgame.

But the

judge didn't touch the decision as to guilt or innocence,
in any fashion, except to say that there shouldn't have been
a trial at all.
Mow, do you understand that one?
MR. LAUER;

Yes.

I disagree with one of the

fundamental propositions of it, but I --

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Go right ahead.

MR. LAUER;

— but I do understand your question.

48
Or at least I understand the statement.
I'm not suggesting that one is law and one is

case, and it’s almost hard to dream of a case where it is

Well, because —

QUESTION:

Under the statute ---

MR. LAUER:

— part of the government's submission

in this case, if Your Honor please, is that one of the reasons

49

they can appeal, in Jenkins in particular , is that the court
explained why it made its mistake.
And, in fact, X would submit that implicit in that
argument is that if the court had not explained to the
Court of Appeals or to the world at large why it had made
an error, that it would net have been appealable.
QUESTIONS

I don't think -- well, I don't

position is that it gets this ability to ask you to correct
these kinds of errors from the fact that the decision is
purely legal, and we are submitting that that's just simply
not the case.
There is almost — a friend once concluded that he
felt like a beggar afc a banquet, and I —* there's an
incredible number of issues to cover here, and it's obvious
that we're not going to reach them all.
I would like, if I may, to talk very briefly
about some of the rest of them.
The government has referred repeatedly to Kepner
Pong Foo, United States vs. Ball, and so forth.

We agree

that United States vs. Bally

that the language in United

States vs. Ball» which has bean referred to, was not language
which was the holding of that case.
However, we submit that since that time that very
language has become the holding of this Court repeatedly.
And we feel that in particular, to get to the government's
point, you're not only going to have to reconsider cases
such as Sisson, but you're going to have to consider, and,
1 would submit, overrule Fong Foo in order to get to 'the point
that the government would take you.
Fong Foo is an interesting case, because clearly
that case would have required a second trial.

There isn't

any question about that.
But the characterisation as an acquittal was
certainly eminently attackable in that case, it was
characterised, as I recall it, as being egregiously erroneous„
Nonetheless, the acquittal was left to stand.
Now, that decision, if there ever was one, was
a complete total error of law.

There was no legal justifica­

tion whatever for what the judge did, no matter what he
might have concluded.

He could have concluded

black was

white in that case, or he could have been correct about
everything.

It could not have affected the fact that he made

a complete total, as I read trie opinion and as I read the
lower court's opinion, a complete and total error of law

51
was committed in that cass.
Mid this Court did not permit itself to be taken
at that time», as far as the government would take you,

I'm

not certain, quite frankly, that that issue was raised in
quite the same way.
But tliis Court did not allow itself at that
time to be taken that far.
And we would submit that to go where the government
takes you today is going to require a complete reconsidera­
tion and overruling, in fact, of Fong Poo.
QUESTIONS

But there there would have bean a

second trial, necessarily.
MR. LAUER:

Correct, yes, sir.

Well, okay, if I may, then, just very briefly,
in the time remaining, address myself to that.

I've

indicated it very briefly, but we do not believe, and
we’ve tried to explain in the brief, that there is a
necessity for a second trial.
A second trial

let me state it this way:

A

second trial is the most obvious situation that can occur
where the double jeopardy clause is implicated, and in fact
it’s the only situation that's going to get to you, because
if the defendant is merely indicted, and the indictment is
somehow overcome through the efforts of defense counsel,
in all likelihood it’s not going to reach tills stage.

52
What happens is -chat where people become indicted,
where the government — where there is a determination of
one kind or another which 'would implicate the double jeopardy
clause, and the government comes back, and it reaches a trial
stage, then you're confronted with a double jeopardy case
in this Court or in appeals courts along the way.
We're suggesting you don’t have to get to that
point, however, to implicate the double jeopardy clause.
My time has expired, and I’d like to -Shank you
gentlemen.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. laser.

You have a few minutes left, Mr. Frey.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FREY:

Well, I’ll try to cover the ground I have

very quickly.
First of all, with respect to the Sisson formula
of what is an acquittal:

It’s not necessarily to be read

the way the Court of Appeals read it, because it says that
it’s an acquittal if it’s a. legal determination on the basis
of facts adduced at trial .relating to the general issue of
the case.
Now, the Court of Appeals assumed that the word
"relating" related to the facts adduced at trial.

I submit

that the correct way to read the formula in Sisson is that

53
the word Mrelating" relates to legal determination, and
it must ba the legal determination that relates to 'the
merits.
And, as Marion makes clear, the determination that
was made here was not a legal determination on the merits.
This is a legal ruling.

We are not challenging any

facts the District Court found. We’re not saying he was
wrong.
We accept every fact, and we say that as a matter
of law the facts that he found don’t warrant the action
that he took.
Now, with respect to Fong Poo, I think it is in
fact the case that in Fong Foo one of the tilings that the
trial judge did, however wrong and however much he shouldn’t
have done it, was to say that on the basis of what ha had
heard no jury could credit the government's case.
That is, he was ruling on a question — in part
on a question of credibility.

He said, No jury could

convict cn the basis of the evidence that had been adduced.
QUESTION:

But the prosecution had finished its

MR. FREY;

That’s true, it was totally wrong

case.

action, and in fact we would be prepared to argue, if
necessary, but we felt it was not necessary and we did not
put in our brief the argument that we had written with

54
respect to the overruling of Fong Foo, but we think that's
clearly another case, and we haven’t asked for it her©.
Now, I think I'd like to close by referring the
Court to what Judge Learned Hand said in the Zisblatt case,
again, which is at page 17 of our brief in tills case.
He said basically that, "although the Constitution
gives an accused person the benefit of any mistakes in his
favor of the first jury he enounfcere, whether it has passed
upon his guilt or not, it does not extend that privilege
to mistakes in his favor by the judge."
And I would like to ask the Court, in deciding this
case, to consider why respondent Wilson should be insulated
from the punishment prescribed by law, if idle District Court
was wrong in its ruling.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:01 p*clock, p.nu, the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
