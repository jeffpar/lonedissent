MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Ho. 74-124, Blue Chip Stamps and others
against Manor Drug Stores.
Mr. Kreps, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLYLf 0. KEEPS ON BEHALF
OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. KEEPS;
Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

The important practical question before this Court is

whether every security issue

subject to the security laws

-/ill be Une nasis for a Federal claim for damages by any
person whenever the issue price cr current market price is
followed by a price rise, or more directly, whether any nonpurchaser, non-seller, or potential investor will have a
private Federal claim to speculate on the market without cost
cr risk of loss and at the expense of actual and existing
investors and to the burden of the Federal judiciary.

This

statement may seem extreme and certainly simplistic, but it
xs tne inevitable practical result of the extreme and simplistic
position taken oy the Securities and Exchange Commission in
this case by calling for the complete judicial abandonment
of the purchaser-seller rule commonly known as the Birnbaum
doctrine.
The fundamental legal issue before this Court upon
which this practical problem is bottomed is to determine what

class of persons should be permitted to bring a judicially
implied private right of action for damages under rule 1Gb-5
as promulgated by the SEC to enforce the prohibitions of
section 10b of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Although

no private right of action is set forth expressly in either
section 10b by Congress or rule 10b-5 of the SEC., the lower
courts have implied such a right of action for purchasers or
sellers since the Kardon case in 1946 and the Fischman case in
1951.

This honorable Court has recognized this implied right

of action for damages inter alia in both Bankers Life and
Affiliated Ute

,

although the existence of the right of action

in the plaintiffs there involved or the plaintiffs" standing
in the non-constitutional sense was not questioned or in issue
in those cases.
The standing of the plaintiff"respondent here is
in question precisely because it has never owned, never
purchased - or never sold the securities upon which it purports
to base its alleged private claim for damages under rule 10b-5.
Now, petitioners concede that a violation of rule
10b-5 in connection with the issuance of these securities has
been alleged in the amended complaint, but petitioners contend
that as a matter of law paiintiff-respondent has no judicially
implied privata right of action for damages arising from the
issuance of the securities precisely

because any such alleged

damage was not incurred by the respondent in connection with

either the purchase or sale of any security by it.
There being no better point of departure in determin
ing the merits of this contention

than rule 10b~5 itself,

it should be observed that the express prohibitions of iOb-5
are applicable "in connection with the purchase or sale of
any security."
In the Birhbaum case the Second Circuit concluded
that rule 10b-5 did not create an ixaplied private right of
action for non-purchasers or non-sellers or potential investor
but only for the defrauded purchaser or seller.

In subsequent

cases the lower courts have recognized the salutory regulatory
purpose of rule 10b-5 and have applied a liberal definition
to the words "purchase or sale" to imply a private right of
action for damages .in the so-called forced seller situation
without requiring a formal consummated transaction.

And the

lower courts also have recognized that the 1934 Act expressly
defines sale or purchase to include contracts for which
consideration lias been given to sell or purchase and have
recognized an implied right of action for damages under 10b-5
in such situations,
That is not the case here because there was no
legally enforceable obligation to buy or to sell and no
contractual relationship existed between respondent and
petitioners or any of them.
Although the Birnbaum

rule has been the subject of

6
some academic criticism, this judicially developed doctrine
has resulted in a rational and predictable framework for
vindication of the policies underlying rule 10b~5.

Even while

the SEC urges the abandonment of the purchase-seller rule, it
now for the first time after many years recognizes or admits
to the practical detrimental consequences of increased
liability exposure, - strike suits, nuisance settlements, and
an impossible standard of draftsmanship imposed upon the
draftsmen of the prospectus if the purchaser-seller rule is not
retained.
Nonetheless, the SEC advocates that the rule be
abandoned, so that any person making an investment decision
even one not to buy, not to do anything, has a private right
of action under 10b-5,

In so proposing this subjective

standard for standing, even the SEC attempts

to ameliorate

the recognized detrimental consequences upon all issuers of
stock and their existing shareholders by suggesting two
limitations, but each limitation is illusory and ineffective *
The SEC proposes first an enhanced burden cf proof
upon plaintiff potential investors and nonpurchasers who claim
they would have bought or sold but for the alleged 10b-5
violation.

Whatever slight burden this may place on the skill

of pleaders in drafting complaints, it is clear that it does
not provide any means of permitting summary disposition of
cases before trial.

Any recipient of a prospectus, anyone with

7
notice of a stock issue or recipient of a press release as in
Texas Gulf Sulphur could subsequently

bring a claim as to

any stock having a post issue or market price rise by simply
alleging receipt of the allegedly defective prospectus or the
press release, the fact of subsequent price increase and the
obvious conclusion that he would have bought at the issue
price or then market price if he had been informed correctly
that the stock was a bargain or would increase in value.
Hindsight will invariably disclose some statement in a
prospectus that appears to be either overemphasized, as alleged
here, or underemphasized in the light of a subsequent price
rise.
In this case, respondent watched the market price
rise for over 2 years before filing the instant lawsuit.

In

the face of the expressed statutory mandate of the 1933 Act
and as reflected by rules and policies of the SEC that all
prospectuses embody a conservative philosophy, it is apparent
that such factual situations of price rise will occur not
infrequently.

But the SEC offers the issuer no rational

means of complying with the conservative disclosure standards
of the 1933 Act and yet avoiding the inevitable line of
potential investor claimants at the Federal courthouse.
The second limitation by the SEC is to impose
vicarious liability upon the corporation only when it benefits
from the alleged violation of rule 10b~5 by its officers.

Presumably this limitation is a recognition by the SEC that
the purposes of the securities laws are not served by forcing
corporations to pay potential investors and nonpurchasers from
proceeds derived from actual purchasers and actual investors.
This second limitation is also illusory,, since motive
is not an element of a 10b-5 claim and section 20(a) of the
1934 Act expressly imposes such vicarious liability upon the
corporation for such acts.

Thus, however meritorious such a

limitation on vicarious liability

might be, Congress has not

seen fit to impose it, and accordingly judicial imposition
would be inappropriate.
But more fundamentally, the position of the SEC
totally ignores the problem of what the substantive elements
of a private claim by nonpurchasers and potential investors
would be.

For example, how many potential investors and non­

purchasers can sue.

If one million shares are issued and sold

at $10 per share for $10 million to 1,000 persons, can everyone
sue who received a prospectus or had knowledge of the issue
but decided not to invest?

If a thousand additional potential

investors did so, 10,000, and so on?

At least under the

present rule the liability is limited to those one million
shares, the money damages to a maximum of $10 million since
that was the total price received and the suit is limited to
purchasers, only they would be able to sue for the amount paid
and that, assumes the diminution of the value of the stock to

9
zero, and the number of potential plaintiffs is limited to
1,000, the actual number who purchased the shares.

Under the

SEC proposal, the number of potential investors and nonpurchasers
and thus potential plaintiffs is totally unknown and only
limited to those who saw or alleged they saw the prospectus
notice or news release involved, and the amount of potential
liability is not $10 million, it is also unknown and without
limit.

Stocks have been known to increase many times over

issue price, and there are innumerable post issuance opportuni­
ties to be an alleged potential investor.

Stocks are sold and

resold after initial issuance, and there is no limitation under
the SEC proposal —
QUESTION

Mr. Kreps, did the Court of Appeals reject

the Blrnbaum rule?
MR. KREPS:

In our view, Mr. Justice White, and in

the view of Judge Ilufstedler in dissent, the Court of Appeals
did reject the Blrnbaum rule because —
QUESTION:

They didn't say it did.

It seemed to

me they said this didn't violate the rule because this sale
followed as a result of an anti-trust decree.
MR. KREPS:
QUESTION:
to;

That's correct, Mr. Justice White.
Aren’t you taking on more than you need

say that here is another court of appeals that embraced

the Blrnbaum rule, it just didn't apply it to this case.
MR. KREPS:

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Mr.

Jusfclce White,analytically rejected the Birnbaum rule because ■—
QUESTION:

You want as to say that this case opposes

one way or another the validity of the Birnbaura rule* just,
forget about the rationale of the Court of appeals and go right
to what you think is the heart of the matter, the Birnbaum rule.
MR. KREPS:

That's correct, Mr. Justice White, and

that is the position of the SEC.
QUESTION:
MR. KREPS:

Well, they are not always right either.
We agree that they are particularly not

right in this case, Mr. Justice White.

But we also think the

majority of the panel below did not expressly reject the

Blrnbau.Tr. rule in name because it recognised that another panel
of the Ninth Circuit in -the Mount Clemens case had already
expressly accepted the Rirnbamtt rule.

Judge Hufstedler in

dissenting —
QUESTION:

You think we have had a considered

discussion by a court of appeals, namely, the Ninth Circuit,
as to whether the Birnbaum rule ought to continue? They never
really faced up to it and talked about the Birnbaum rule as
such, have they?
MR. KREPS:

Yes. Mr. Justice White.

In the Mount

Clemens decision another panel of the Ninth Circuit expressly —
QUESTION:
MR. KREPS:

Not in this case.
Not in this case, the majority did not.

Judge Hufstedler in her dissent said that they should adopt the

Blrnbaum rule, that it exists in the Ninth Circuit, and that
the majority was trying to

ride around it with their so-called

functional equivalent analysis which I think she correctly
dissected as being without merit.
QUESTION:

Does not the Court of Appeals, including

the Ninth Circuity normally xxot permit one panel of the court
of three judges to overrule the holdings of another panel,
especially if they are recent?
MR. KREPS:

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, I think that

was the problem the majority of the panel was faced with in
our case.

And I think the majority's decision and their

seising on this concept of functional equivalent is a classic
law school text book example of hard facts making bad law.
QUESTION:

Well, are you suggesting that what they

did was do indirectly, that is, overrule its earlier panel
decision, without saying so, by indirection?
MR. KREPS:

Yes, Mr. Justice Burger.

I do not think

you can reconcile the reasoning or purported reasoning of the
majority panel below with the panel in Mount Clemens.

And when

we petitioned for a rehearing in banc, the panel in Mount
Clemens voted for granting that rehearing in banc, and we
fell — we received five votes and fell just one vote short
of getting a rehearing in banc in the Ninth Circuit.

I think

if v/e had had that rehearing, the outcome would have been
different, because I can see no intellectual basis for

distinguishing the majority decision of the panel below from
overruling Birnbaum.

They simply tried to ride around it,

because 1 think they were unduly impressed by the allegations
of the amended complaint here
QUESTION:

Mr. Kreps, I notice that neither you nor

your opponent seem to have cited Justice Stewart!s opinion for
the Court last year in the Amtrack case where the Court held
that the provision of one type of civil remedy excluded another.
I should think in view of the provision of section 11 as well
as the Act of 1933, that might be of some significance to your
case.
MR. KREPSs

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I concur that it.

is, particularly on another issue that is attempted to be.
raised by the SEC at the last minute, and that is whether there
is a private remedy under section 17 of the 1933 Act other than
is set forth in section 12(2) of the '33 Act.

The problem

is that there is no civil remedy whatsoever provided by
Congress in section 10 of the Act
QUESTION:
MR. KREPS:
Justice Stewart,

The ’34 Act.
Of the *34 Act, that's correct, Mr.

There is none under the ‘34 Act at all

expressly provided by Congress as there is under the ‘33 Act.
And the entire remedy that is before the Court here has been
judicially created commencing with the Kardon case in 1946.
QUESTION:

But never

or ara I mistaken?

Has it

over been explicitly accepted by this group?
MR. KREPS:

It has never been explicitly accepted in

the sense that the standing of the plaintiff was in issue,
I think that Affiliated Ute and Bankers Life and particularly
footnote 10 in Bankers Life indicates that the Court accepted
the concept of an implied judicial remedy under section 10
and 10b-5.
?

QUESTION:

Borak involved something else, didn't it?

The Borak case suggests something else.
MR. KREPS:

Yes.

That did not involve that issue.

One other —
QUESTION:

The Court, we did, denied cert in

Birnbaum itself, did it not, in '52?
MR. KREPS:
QUESTION:
it in unison

Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan.
And then the Seventh Circuit rejected

and perhaps last October we denied cert there,

didn't we?
MR. KREPS:
voting to grant cert.

You denied cert with three Justices
I believe Mr. Chief Justice Burger,

Fir. Justice White, and Mr. Justice Douglas.
QUESTION:

If I am not mistaken, that was not a

final judgment. . Hot that that goes to the jurisdiction of the
Court, but, I mean, in other words, the defendants might
still have prevailed in that case, if I remember correctly.
MR. KREPS:

That's correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.

14
QUESTION:

Do you know whether Congress has ever

been asked to address this question?
MR. KKEPSs

No, I do not, Mr. Justice Brennan.

It

certainly should be, and we did not intend to urge before the
Court this morning that it overrule the lower courts in
recognizing a judicially and implied private right for damages
under section 10, but certainly that could be a legitimate
issue before this Court.
I would like to return briefly to one more example
of the dangers of the rule advocated by the SEC to extend this
private implied right for damages to potential investors.
Consider the potential investor who has only $1,000
to .invest and considers stocks A, B, and C, but buys only A.
Does he have a claim for a price rise of B and C?

What if

stock A rises more than B and C or less than B but more than C?
Then if you multiply the number of stocks A, B, and C by the
number of different stocks traded or issued each year and have
this investor with only a thousand dollars to invest, how many
lawsuitr does he have?

Or in fact, does this potential investor

even have to invest in any stock at all but simply use the
thousand dollars for an alternative investment and play the
market without cost or risk of loss?

And what if the alternative

investment rises more than stock A, B or C?

Has he been

damaged no- matter how fraudulent the prospectus discouraging
him to purchase stock A, B, or C?

And one final problem:

What

15

of

the tremendous burden on the Federal courts to be forced

to litigate the potential merits of all those potential
investor claims brought as questionable class actions, all
claims seeking speculative lost profits?

The purchaser-seller

rule as developed and refined over the past quarter century
accomplishes the salutory purpose of establishing rational
and predictable requirements of standing for the proper
vindication of rule lOfo-5 claims with probable merit.

In

aggravated cases of alleged actual fraud, such as claimed in
one count here, potential investors and nonpurchases have
an appropriate common law remedy in State court just as
respondent is pursuing in the California State court.

But

the purposes and policies of the Federal security laws are
not served and cannot be reconciled by allowing any and all
nonpurchasers and potential investors to speculate on the market
without cost or risk of loss and at the expense of that
securities market actual investors in a Federal court system
already overburdened with litigation.

Accordingly standing

under lGb-5 should not be extended judicially to such potential
investors and nonpurchasers as respondent in the instant case.
With the Court’s permission, I would reserve my
remaining time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Ryan.

Very well, Mr. Kreps.

16
ORAL ARGUMENT 02’ JAMES E. RYAN, ON BEHALF
OF RESPONDENT
MR. RYAN:
please:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may the Court

I feel constrained to comment upon two of the

arguments just made by Mr. Kreps.

One is in response to a

question by the Court whether or not the Ninth Circuit in this
case has abandoned the Birnbaum rule.
In the Mount Clemens case which involved a situation
where there was a public auction of securities, the plaintiffs
in that action brought a 10b-5 action on the grounds that
they had been defrauded from making a bid at that auction.
They were not offerees such as we are in this case.

They had

no transactional or causal nexus with the party selling the
shares.

Go that the Ninth Circuit in Mount Clemens found that

there was no standing under 10b.

I feel by that they did

adopt a portion, at least, of the Birnbaum rule.
Another argument that counsel has made concerns the
unknown quantity of claimants that may arise.

He gave an

example of an offering of a million shares and there may be
50 million people that will come later when the stock goes up
and say, "Gee, I would have bought that stock."
the situation here.

That is not

Here we have an exact amount of shares

offered to an exact amount of offerees at an exact price.

The

amount of persons that, could bring a claim out of this aecior­
is wholly limited.

QUESTION:
the

But how .do you distinguish that situation in

language of the rule from the situation that your opposing

counsel was

posing to the Court?

What is it in rule 10b-5

that would, if we allow this, prevent the many other suiters
who are not precisely in this situation?
MR. RYAN:

I should preface that by saying that I

have ceded 10 of my minutes to the counsel for SEC,

He is

going for the home run, and I am going for the base hit.

He

is asking the Court that the Birnbaum rule in total be
abolished.

I am saying that, fine, if that's necessary, that

will get us our day in court, then fine.

But we are submitting

to this Court that that is not necessary in our case.
The purchaser-seller language as we know is courtcreated.

10b just says that in connection with the purchase

or sale.

We submit that when Congress enacted that statute,

it would not have needed the language”!!! connection with" if
it wished to limit causes of action under that section to
strictly —
QUESTION:

But it is a construction of the statute

that the courts have been engaged in, isn't it?
some judicial policy? it’s a construction

It's not just

of the Federal

statute.
MR. RAYN:

That's correct.

However, since Birnbaum

was decided in 1952, the cases are legion which have attempted
to get away from the harshness of that rule.

The court below

18

in cur case likewise saw a harshness in the rule..

There have

been the forced seller exceptions, there have been the aborted
purchaser-seller exceptions, there have bean any number of
exceptions, including the most recent opening of the doors to
injunctive relief.
QUESTION:

What is so harsh about it?

I mean it's

just a line drawing that you have in every single area of the
law, isn’t it?
MR. RYAN:

Well, in the situation where you would

have a case such as ours, I think that it's presented by the
anomaly of the situation.

If the petitioners in this case in

making their offering had persuaded the respondents to purchase
some but not all of the. shares to which we were entitled, then
I think we clearly would have no problem with the purchaserseller rule.

What the petitioners are suggesting is that

since their fraud, since their misleading statements were so
successful that we didn't buy it at all, that therefore we are
outside the standing requirements.
not what Congress intended.

And we feel that that is

That is the atypical fraud, which

has been pointed out by several circuits, that Congress did
not intend to just, outlaw the typical kinds of fraud.
this is certainly an atypical kind.

And

This is a highly unusual

situation where you have an offeror putting out securities
that it hopes won’t sell.
situation.

And that’s the anomaly of the

I think to deny the respondents

standing in this

case to bring a 10b-5 action sanctions the total success of
their fraud.
QUESTION:

You think it can be limited to that,

category, do you?
MR. RYAN:

I do, your Honor.

I feel that in this

case I’ve stressed in my brief that we have a unique set of
circumstances.

We have a unique set of facts.

the Ninth Circuit recognized this.

X think that

I think we had discussed

the Birnbaum rule and the exceptions thereunder to the effect
that there have bean cases where courts have created what we
may call a fiction, if no else, whereby they found a contract
to purchase or sell.

We’ve had situations where persons

bought illusory stock.

That's no purchase at all.

But in

the present case the Ninth Circuit saw that to deny the
plaintiffs in this case standing would be harsh.

They found

that the peculiar unique right that flowed from that consent
decree, that duty that was upon the petitioners herein to make
a fair offering served as the functional equivalent of a
contract.

And I think that this case can properly be limited

to that area of exceptions which the courts have now recognized
in the Blr.nbaura rule.
QUESTION:

What if we disagreed with you that this

was a rational distinction and that if the Birnbaum rule was
to be followed, you must lose the case?

What should we do

then if we disagree with you that there is a limited exception

possible here?

Should we reach the issue of overruling

BirabaniTi or not accepting Birnbaum or rejecting it, or should
v/a remand to the Ninth Circuit?
MR» RYAN;

Well, I think first if this Court feels

that our case as presented in the amended complaint does not
fall within one of the exceptions or is not an exception in
and of itself because of its peculiarity , then I tin ink the
Court has to reach the whole Birnbaum rule and whether or not
it —QUESTIONS

Why wouldn't we remand to the Ninth

Circuit and let them give their considered attention to the
Birnbaum rule as such?

It hasn't here in this case.

MR. RYAN:

Not in this case it has not.

QUESTION:

The Court of Appeals has done it in a

previous case.
MR. RYAN:

It did do so.

I believe that it did adopt

the Birnbaum rule in the Mount Clemens case.
QUESTION:

And the Seventh Circuit is •—

QUESTION:

But that's arguable, isn't it?

QUESTION:

They've done it in another case and we

have the benefit of their thinking on the other side.

It has

been canvassed in the courts of appeals, including this one.
MR. RYAN:

I believe there are three or four circuits

that have not directly reached the Birnbaum issue, but ■—
QUESTION:

But, Mr. Ryan, I take it if Judge Hufstedle

21
is right and in Mount Clemens they did adopt, that panel did
adopt- the Third C.rcuit rule, then the practice that the Chief
Justice suggested earlier, I would suppose if we did what ray
Brother White suggests, would result automatically, would it
not, in this panel following Mount Clemens?
MR. RYAN;

If this Court found that this present case

did not come within one of the exceptions.

Then you would go

back and I would think that the court would follow Mount
Clemens.
QUESTION;

I take it that argues — unless they would

go in en banc.
MR. RYAN:

Pardon?

QUESTION:

Unless that went on banc.

QUESTION:

This Court has on occasion,when there were

contrasting panels in a circuit and the circuit certified
the case is a doubtful question,remanded and said in effect,
"Resolve your own conflicts first,5’ has it not?
MR. RYAN:

Yes.

QUESTION;

But you say there is no conflict between

what the panel did in Mount Clemens and what the panel did in
this case.

In Mount Clemens they apparently thought so, or

at least had some doubt about it, did they not?
MR. RYAN:

They had some doubt about it.

But again

the petition for a rehearing in banc was denied.
QUESTION:

What was the vote on the denial?

22
MR. RYANs

Thera were five dissenting.

If I knew

the total number , I would do some quick subtraction on how
many voted for.

Six to five.

QUESTION:

You have a .litigation pending in the State

courts, do you, on this same basic claim?
MR. RYAN:

We have that.

QUESTION:

You do?

MR. RYAN:

Yes,

QUESTION3

Mr. Ryan, on that same point.» do you

consider your State remedy inadequate?

And if so, in what

respect?
MR. RYAN:
inadequate.

Well, for two reasons I consider it

One, the burden of proof, as I understand it, in

a State securities action is greater than it is under 10b,
QUESTION:

Why would that be so?

Isn’t this garden

variety fraud that you allege in the final analysis?
MR. RYAN:
analysis.

It's fraud that we allege in the final

However, the test, as I understand it under the

Securities Exchange Act, the plaintiff is not required to bring
in each and every one of the offerees and have him sit on the
stand and say,"But for the fraud ef the defendants I definitely
would have purchased the stock."

As I understand it it's

a lesser burden of proof, that is, that the misstatements or
the fraud of the defendants in a particular 10b case have
influenced or would have influenced his decision.

Whereas,

23

under the State securities law and common lav; fraud, he would
have, to go through the normal elements of a fraud case to show
actual reliance.,
QUESTION5

Do you think that tills kind of situation

lends itself to a class action when the proof under this Ninth
Circuit holding, the proof in each case would be likely to
vary a great deal?
MR. RYAN:

Well, again, Mr. Chief Justice, I think

that as the rules on proof under 10b-5 actions, that the decision
of the investor was influenced or would have been influenced.
I don’t think it creates an imponderable burden for the
plaintiff in a class action.

I think if you first prove that

the allegations, or I should say the statements contained in
what we term the negative prospectus, are truly misleading and/or
false, then I think that you at that point have fraudulent
conduct, and I think that fraudulent conduct in and of itself
would probably affect the decision of any potential investor

in a class action.
QUESTION:

Well, can a plaintiff in a 10b-5 action

even though he may never have read the prospectus simply take
the stand and say, "If I had read it, it would have influenced
me against buying," and that brings him within the class that is
entitled to recover?
MR. RYANt

No, I do not think it goes that far.

I

think that he would have to show some knowledge on his part of

24
the prospectus.

But X don’t think it needs to go too far

beyond that.
QUESTION:

You indicated earlier, did you, that if

he has read about it in the newspaper, in the Wall Street
Journal, for example, that would be enough,, even if he had
not seen the prospectus?
MR. RYAN:

You are speaking of the persons who are

in the selective class that I sepresent?
I haven’t given that any thought.

It is possible,

I’m presuming that the

persons who would come within the class in this case would
be those who had received and considered the prospectus.

I

suppose that a Wall Street Journal article or any other type
of publication concerning this offering, if it contained
misleading items and was read by one of the selected offerees
would possibly serve the same function.

It might just as

well persuade him.
We feel that the test to foe used in the purchaserseller cases such as this and as was applied in the Eason case
is determine whether or not the plaintiffs are within that
class intended to be protected by Congress.

We feel that

the nature of the history of this case, that being the consent
decree, the duty of the petitioners to make a fair and full
disclosure, a fair and full and honest offering to the
plaintiffs, is that it makes them that type of person intended
to be protected by Congress.

25

I see a common strain in all of the cases which
have considered Birnbaum and have carved out the several
exceptions. And that common strain I see is a transactional
or causal nexus.
Counsel has expressed concern over the opening of the
floodgates should the plaintiffs in this action be permitted
to have their day in court.

I cannot strenuously enough

emphasise that we are net suggesting that the man on the
street who might have bought IBM this morning at 10 o’clock
stands in the same shoes as the plaintiffs in this action.
Here we had an offering that was made pursuant to consent
decree.

We had a specific price.

We had a specific time.

The

defendants in this case had a duty to make an offering/ and we
do not feel that there is any relationship between a man on
the street and a parson who owned a right or entitlement such
as we did to purchase these shares.
QUESTION2

Mr. 'Ryan, let’s assume for the moment that

no offering had been made at all as may have been required
by the consent decree.

Would your clients have had a cause

of action, this cause of action?
MR. RYAN:

If no offering had been made.

QUESTION:

None.

No offering had been made although

the consent decree may have required it.

In other words, could

your clients have enforced the consent decree by suit against
petitioner?

MR. RYAN:

I would like to be able to distinguish

the Control Data Corporation case and the like, but X don't
think it can be.

I don't think it's in this case.

1 don't

We have stated in our briefs that we

do not pretend to enforce that consent decree in this action.
The purpose of the consent decree, as I see it, and I am sure

history as to why these plaintiffs and these defendants had
such a unique relationship, why were not the man on the street

That consent decree

So we are not attempting to enforce

X don't think we can.

I think the cases

are clear on that, the Armour and the Control Data Corporation
cases.
QUESTION:

So you had no right under the decree and

no contractual right to have a chance to buy these securities.
MR. RYAN:

Well, X am not saying that v?e didn't have

a contractual right.
QUESTION:

What was it?

MR. RYAN:

Well, as the Ninth Circuit stressed, it

was a functional equivalent of a contract to purchase these
shares.

We should not, as the Ninth Circuit said and also in

Eason, X believe, we should not go for form over.substance.
I think that's what we are getting at here.

To say it's a functional equivalent is

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Vary well.

Mr. Ferber.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID FERBER ON BEHALF OF
THE SEC AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT
MR. FERBER:

Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please:

The petitioner is urging this Court to sanction a doctrine that
would deprive the conceded victim of a securities fraud of
standing to bring any action for his damages solely because

he was not a purchaser or seller of securities.
There have been four cases decided by this Court
that there are implied causes of action under the Securities
Exchange Act,

two of them involving 10b, the Affiliated Ute

case and the Superintendent of Insurance case.

The standing

of the injured plaintiff here to bring such an action is the
only issue in this case before the Court.

The fraud here was

that of deceiving persons who had an investment decision to
make, and they were deceived, and for that reason they are
seeking damages.

The dissenting judge below admits there was

28

a violation of 10fo-5, and the petitioner concedes this.
QUESTIONs

Well, as stated, then, the way you have

just stated it, that broadly, that would mean, I guess you can
argue that the broad issue that Mr. Kreps submitted to us is
here.
MR. FERBERs

I certainly think it is.

It’s an issue

that the Seventh Circuit has said, ,4We will net adopt this
doctrine."

Several circuits have held, "Wo do adopt this

doctrina," and I certainly think it is rips for review by
this Court under those circumstances.
QUESTIONs
MR. FERBER:

And presented by this case.
And 1 think it is presented by this

case because at least it is arguable with respect to the
exemptions that the Court drew whether or not that is a valid
exemption, and as we point out in our brief, there is
probably just, as much litigation now as to what is exempt
under the so-called Birnbauia purchaser-seller doctrine as to
whether or not the doctrine should be applicable.
QUESTION;
MR. FERBERs
QUESTION:
MR. FERBERs

What is the Ninth Circuit's rule on it?
Well, the Ninth Circuit —
As of now.
The Ninth Circuit's rule is that they

believe that purchaser-seller limitation is applicable.

They

are making an exception in this case because of the existence
of the antitrust decree.

At about the same time a different

29
panel of that circuit,, very shortly before this opinion# in
the Mount Clemens case# which was very sirailar to this in
some respects# the Court determined that because the plaintiff
there was not the purchaser or seller# he had no cause of
action.
Now# in the Mount Clemens case what happened was
this:

A hundred percent of the shares of a company was being

sold at auction# of a subsidiary company in financial
difficulties.

The company that was in difficulty# whose

shares were being sold, had an officer *vho had formerly been
an officer of the plaintiff.

The plaintiff said we are going

to bid at that sale# and this officer# according to the
allegations# lied to him and told him that the business of the
subsidiary was no good.

They didn't bid in the sale# and

ultimately the officer who had lied allegedly# he was head#
or an officer# of a different company that ended up with that
subsidiary.
QUESTION:

So you have one#you say that the Mount

Clemens followed the Blrnbaum rule?
MR. FERE

;'H

The court relied solely on the purchaser-

seller doctrine in Mount Clemen^.
QUESTION!

I'm asking you.

Do

you say that Mount

Clemens they followed it?
MR. FEKBER:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
And in this case they walk around it.

MR. FERBER:
QUESTION:

In this case they walked around it.
So what is the rule of the Ninth Circuit?

To walk around or ~~
MR. FERBER:
Ninth Circuit says,

find exceptions in this case and in that case and in the other
'case.
QUESTION:
MR. FERBER:
QUESTION:

We apply the Birnbaum rule when we want to.
Precisely.
Mr. Ferber, is it a fair statement to say

that the Birnbaum principle was submitted to the district court
and decided in this case?
MR. FERBER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

I believe so, your Honor.

You, I take it, would say that the

exception purportedly carved out by the Ninth Circuit really
cari’t withstand analysis, and that if you are going to have the
Birnbaum rule, the result reached below shouldn’t have been
reached.
MR. FERBER:

X just can’t accept that we are going

to have the Birnbaum rule.

I mean, I don't know, I think that

any exception to it is probably a reasonable one, because it
doesn’t make any sense to me.

To me it is completely

arbitrary.
QUESTION:

In other words, both the rule and the

exceptions are fictions in your approach.

31
MR. FEESER:

I think the rule is basically, although

it’s arbitrary — I don't know that I can say it's a fiction.
1 think the exceptions , like most exceptions from it# would be
good.
I should say, though, first of all —
QUESTION:

Well, you are saying if you don't believe

in a rule, then you think any exception, to it is fine.
MR. FEEBERs

Well, I suppose that's right.

(Laughter.)
But let me say this:

It does not mean ~~ giving up

the rule does not mean that all the parade of horribles that
were set forth by the petitioner would necessarily occur or
Would occur.

There are various distinctions.

I think there are

many cases where the lower courts have talked in terms of the
Birnbaum rule because other circuits had mentioned it, but that
there were other reasons they could have held that the plaintiff
had no action.

For example, one of the cases cited is

someone against Wolfson.
the moment.

I can't think of the name of it at

What was charged in that case was that the

officers of the company had manipulated the securities and
then bought some of the company's securities at a low price
and subsequently manipulated it some more and sold back to the
company at the higher manipulated price.
Now, the action was brought by a stockholder of the
company, not as a derivative action.

And the court said, well,

32
under the Birnbaara rule you are not a plaintiff — a purchaser
or seller, you are just a stockholder.
On the other hand , had they brought it as a derivative
action, the company was certainly a purchaser or seller , and
I certainly don't suggest that the plaintiff

in that type

of situation should necessarily have a causa of action.

His

injury was indirect through his corporation.
On the other hand, I think that case illustrates, had
the plaintiff, because the market was low and had been so
manipulated, sold his stock, he would presumably have a cause
of action under the Birnbausn rule.

He would be a seller.

So that is why I am saying it is an arbitrary rule
and I guess the correct ~ it is an artificial rule.
QUESTION:

Mr . Ferber, has the Commission ever

asked the Congress to do anything about the Birnbaum rule?
MR. FERBER:

We don't think this Court has ever

acted on the Birnbaum rule.

QUESTIONS

Has that been a reason not to go to

Congress with it?
Mil. FERBER:

Well, in part this Court only new, about

two or -three years ago in Affiliated Ute and Superintendent of
Insurance was the first that this Court had made clear that
there is a private cause of action under rule lGb~5.

The

district, lower courts for some time had been finding such an
action.

But until at least there was judicial opinion at the

top, there at least might have been some question in Congress
why should we be running up there*
QUESTION:

Well, I gather if we sustain the Birnbaum

rule , then the Commission will go to Congress and ask them to
overrule it.
MR. FERBER:

I would think that that is certainly a

possibility.
QUESTION:

Do you always wait until this Court has

acted, or have you sometimes gone to Congress with recommenda­
tions on the basis of Courts of Appeals’ holdings?
MR. FERBER:

I don’t recall any incidents where we

have on an interpretation of a Court of Appeals gone to
Congress.

I don’t want to say, your Honor, that we never have.
QUESTION:

Well, it has been around a long time in

You and Mr. Ryan seem to disagree a little

He at least intimates rather strongly for me that the

Ninth Circuit has just punched a hole., to take your phrase,
punched another hole in the Birnbaum doctrine.

You are taking

the position that they have wiped it out, if I understood you.
MR. FERBER*
wiped it out.

No, your Honor, I don’t say they have

we felt they hadn’t wiped it out, that they had carved out an

I suppose it is possible.

I suppose your position would be that

it's not uncommon for courts of appeals or other courts,
intermediate courts, to evolve exceptions to rules over a

swallow up the rule.
MR. FERBERs
QUESTION?

That's right.
But you now say that this exception doesn't

swallow up the entire rule.
ME. FERBERs

It certainly does not, and it leaves

this completely arbitrary rule on the books.
QUESTION?

tod there is a square conflict in the

circuits.
MR. FERBERs
QUESTIONS

There is a square conflict.
Because the Seventh Circuit has explicitly

declined to follow the Birnbaura rule.
MR. FERBERs
QUESTIONS

Exactly, your Honor.
And whether this Court of Appeals for the

Ninth Circuit can be said to have done more or less the same
thing i.n fact or not done, it is rather unimportant because other
courts of appeals have said, "We do follow 'the Birnbaum rule."

36

MR. FERBERs

That’s right.

And why, for example -- one of the cases in the
Second Circuit is illustrative, it seems to me, of the
inequity.

Actually, in that case they ultimately did find

sale. Btit this was the case where in connection with a
?
tender offer, the allegations were that there had been a
misleading offer.

Most of the stockholders turned over their

shares, 20-some percent.

And the corporation therefore was

merged out of existence into the other one.

The man who

sued was one who had not sold his securities, and we urged
the Court of Appeals in the Second Circuit at that time since
ha was not a seller in that sense to ignore or overrule their
initial Birnbaum rule, and the Court of Appeals, however, did
not do that.

Instead they said ultimately he is going to

have to sell his securities and therefore we will treat him
as a seller.
Mow, it seems to us that the logic would be that
this man was defrauded. I would just like to -MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Mr. Kreps, you have six

37
minutes left.
REBUTTAL argument of allyn o. kreps
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. KREPS;
the Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

With respect to the question of whether Eir-ibaua

is actually an issue in this case and in further response to
the question of Mr. Justice Blackman, the motion, to dismiss
in the district court was expressly made on the ground of the
Birnbaum rule, and the memorandum opinion of the district
court squarely substantiated the dismissal of the complaint
on the Birnbaum rule.
With respect to whether Birnbaum is in issue here
and there is the inconsistency in the circuits, we again
submit that there is an inconsistency in the Ninth Circuit
between Mount Clemens and the majority panel below, and
Judge Hufstedler in her dissenting opinion on page 143 of our
appendix says flatly, "The result reached by the majority is
inconsistent with the holding and reasoning of this court's
recent decision in Mount Clemens Industries, Inc, v, Bell,18
and we think the reason that the majority found it necessary
to adopt this exceptionally fusay equivalent function analysis
was that there, as now conceded by respondents, was no contractus
right under the consent decree. And really what the functional
equivalent language says is that we in essence are finding
these people third' party beneficiaries of a contract or a

38
consent decree.

And the obvious danger of that reasoning is

that every stock issue has an underwriting contract,, and if
you applied that reasoning, you could find every underwriting
contract between the issuer and the underwriter and the
subsequent brokers as a contract made for the ultimate
benefit of the potential purchasers, and then you do genuinely
get into the parade of true horribles which I indicated in my
opening argument.
The only explanation we have for the panel below,
the majority, going awry as much as it did is the hard facts
alleged in the complaint.

But if there is any merit to those

hard facts, they may be vindicated in the State court action
which is currently pending.
One last point, and that is with respect to Mr.
Justice Brennan's question on the Eason case in the Seventh
Circuit.

Should the purchaser-seller rule be abandoned or

bent in any manner?

As the Eason court favored, it should be

noted that in the Eason case the plaintiffs there in the
words of the court suffered ”as

investors and as principles

in the transaction" and they were shareholders in the
corporation that sold stock for certain assets, and then they
executed a personal guarantee of the liabilities on the
acquired assets to someone else.

They certainly could have

brought an action, a derivative action on behalf of their own
corporation «ns a result of the purchase or sale, and X think

39
the language of the Eason court indicates that they actually
were principals involved.

So that may not even be a departure

from the purchaser-seller rule.
In any event, it would not be a sufficient departure
to encompass the respondent in this case because everyone concedes
that they are not purchasers, not sellers, not investors, and
have never expended one dime.

They are only seeking.

Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
Thank you,gentlemen.-

Thank you, Mr. Kreps.

The case is submitted.

[Whereupon, at 11:06 a.iru, the oral argument in the
above-entitled matter was concluded.]
