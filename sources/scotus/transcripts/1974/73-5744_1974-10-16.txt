MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 73-5744, Taylor against Louisiana.
Mr. King, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM McM. KING, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. KING:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Louisiana constitutional provisions and
statutory provisions are die same in this case as were present
in the Healy case.

But there is this distinction:

the

appellant here was charged with a serious criminal offense,
a capital offense in Louisiana, found guilty by a jury, an
all-male jury chosen from an all-male jury '.venire.
A motion to quash the jury venire prior to trial was
entered and denied.

The motion was based on the grounds that

his rights to an impartial jury under the guarantees of the
Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States
Constitution were denied him.
QUESTION: Would your position be the same, Mr. King,
if in fact there had been five woman on this jury who had
got there by the existing processes?
MR, KING: With the existing constitutional and
statutory provisions, the position that we take would still
be the same

4
QUESTION s

In other words, you —

MR. KING:

On its face, we say the constitutional

and statutory provisions which not only exempt but exclude
women is unconstitutional.

It provides for jury service only

where the woman volunteers, and excludes her from the jury
unless she does volunteer.
The stipulation of fact between the State and Healy
are equally applicable to this case, in that it occurred at
the same time and during the same period.

And that stipulation

showed the complete failure of the volunteer system for women,
as adopted by the Constitution and the State statute.
The distinction in this and the Healy case, as we
see it, is that here we have a Sixth Amendment question, which
arises because of this Court's opinion in Duncan vs. Louisiana,
v/hieh opinion v/as rendered in 196 0,

This trial took place in

1972.
In Duncan vs, Louisiana, the Court will remember, the
right of a State court defendant in a serious criminal trial
to a jury was granted him by application of the Sixth
Amendment through the Fourteenth Amendment.
In Williams ys. Florida, there was an attempt made
to have this Court extend the application of Duncan vs.
Louisiana to a 12«man jury.

And the Court denied that

extension on trie grounds that numbers alone did not constitute
the essential attribute of a jury.

5
That same position was taken, I believe, by the
Court in hpodaca, where the number necessary to convict was
at issue. But here the quality of the jury is at issue, and
an essential attribute of the jury trial is at issue for
criminal defendants.
QUESTION:
MR. KING:

What is that?
Pardon?

QUESTION: What is that essential attribute?
MR. KING:

In the very case which denied the

extension to the 12-man jury, this Court declared what the
essential attribute was.

It said that the purpose of a jury

was to prevent oppression by government, and that the manner
in which it is exercised is by the jury in a barrier between
the government or the accusor and the accused.

And that in

order to form an effective barrier, the Court stated that it
is composed of representative segments of the community, and
that in denying.that the 12-man jury apply to Louisiana, the
Court looked to whether the number on the jury had the effect
of denying that representative cross-section of the
community.
QUESTION:

Well, why would a jury composed of 12

men be expected to hurt your client's chances, if your client
is a man?
MR. KING;

If Your Honor is asking me whether I can

feel, touch, smell or taste that harm, or whether there is a

6

harm that is tangible in character# I cannot do so.
QUESTIONs Well# then, what authority do you have forsaying that in the absence of such, on what decision of this
Court do you rely on?
MR. KINGs Well, I rely primarily in the federal
context, in the federal courts, on the Thiel case.
QUESTION:

But of course that wasn't -- that was a

federal court decision reviewing the jury system in federal
courts, wasn't it?
MR. KING: But the Court found there that the exemption
by the federal judge of daily wage earners violated the
system of jury to such an extent that it would not even look
into whether the party, the appellant in that case, was a
member of that class.

They — this Court would not even go

behind that.
Once it found that the jury system
QUESTION:

But that was a Seventh Amendment case,

involving a civil jury trial.

Now, the Seventh Amendment has

not application to the States, does it?
MR, KING:

That's correct, Your Honor.

But if the

— if that application was made in a civil jury trial, much
more so should it apply to a criminal jury trial.
QUESTION: That's your principal authority, then, is
the Thiel case, for saying that your client has standing to
raise this issue?

7

MR. KING s
reasoning,

Only by application arid by a inode of

I believe the Duncan case —
QUESTION:

Well,, you rely on Duncan —

MR. KING:

I believe Duncan --

QUESTION:

~ you rely on Duncan and some other

cases that say that if you"re going to satisfy the jury
requirement of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, the
jury should be drawn from a fair cross-section of the
community.
MR. KING:

Absolutely.

is the principal case.

I believe the Duncan case

In Peters vs. Kiff, which was a

standing case, betvreen a white who was complaining of the lack
of blacks.
QUESTION:

On a grand jury,

MR. KING:

On a grand jury.

I believe it also may

have been applicable to the petit jury in that case.
It is not that case that I'm relying upon, but the
Court stated in that case —
QUESTION:
MR, KING:

Was there a Court opinion in that case?
Pardon?

QUESTION: Was there an opinion for the Court in
that case?
MR. KING:

There was a divided Court — three,

three, three,
QUESTION:

Which — which opinion are you going to

0

rely on?
[Laughter.3
MR. KING:

The language in the ~~ in Justice

Marshall's opinion and the language in Chief Justice Burger's
opinion, the dissenting opinion, express the thought of the
Court, I believe, that if that had been a post-Duncan case,
there would have bean little question of the standing to
complain.
QUESTION:

1 thought the Chief Justice's opinion

relied on the notion of prejudice and that there ought to ba
some showing of prejudice.
MR, KING;

It was a dissenting opinion.

i believe that, in essence, that's so.

But the language in the Court's dissenting opinion stated that
we are not here concerned with the essential attributes of
trial by jury.

But here you are concerned with the essential

attributes of trial by jury*
If in Duncan vs. Louisiana you apply the jury to the
States in criminal proceedings, serious criminal proceedings,
then to deny the essence of the jury trial is to, in effect,
deny the jury trial.

Because if you don't have a jury composed

in as large a measure as possible of representative cross
segments, you have no jury.
QUESTION: Well, you would, X suppose, concede that
the rule would only be that the jury panels should -- or the
venire should be a representative cross-section, not the

9

actual jury?
MR» KING;

Oh, no, sir.

QUESTION:

Yes,

MR. KING;

The venire.

The jury venire»

Who can say whether the

selection from the venire will bring about a proportion that
t

is -QUESTION:
MR. KING:

To let alone

peremptory challenges?

Yes, sir.

The possibility of bias in situations where State
juries do not have to be selected, as far as possible, from
a cross-section of the community is so present, that without
a restriction on the State juries, selection systems, it is
tantamount to saying that you have no jury at all,
QUESTION: Well, then you're really saying that we
haven't had juries at all for over a century in this country?
MR* KING:

When 53 percent of a community are

excluded from the jury, I xvould say that that's correct,
Your Honor.
■QUESTION: Would you throw into limbo convictions
that have been had, then, for, under the old system, for
years and years?
HR. KING:

Of course that's a problem I really

don't feel that I can answer,

I'm arguing a case for a

particular individual, who has raised this issue prior to
trial. What may be the fate of those who have been

10

convicted under this exclusionary device# I really would
rather not say.
QUESTION;

Well# I merely ahk it only because you

said that this didn't equate with a jury# therefore we haven't
had a jury system for years and years.
MR. KING;

It doesn't equate with what the Court has

said was a jury.
QUESTION:
active.

Yes# but Duncan was never made retro-*-

Because Duncan didn't question the reliability of

non-crdss-.section juries.

It just emphasized the political

v

role of a jury.
MR. KING:

Well, it does no good, Your Honor.

QUESTION: And it wasn't made retroactive, was it?
MR. KING:

It was not made retroactive.

Duncan.

But it does not good to say that juries are meant to protect
people's liberty and yet deprive the jury of an essential
attribute.

Because the same-jury that was present in the

Thiel case may well have been the same }Ury to protect the
liberty that we speak of.

' i.

The mere —
QUESTION:

Your argument would apply equally to a

jury from which five, the only five women were stricken by
peremptory challenges.
MR. KING;

But you haven't —-

But there, Your Honor, that's a matter of

Peremptory challenges

11
QUESTION:

Not the choice, necessarily,of the

MR, KING:

But where the law, the law excludes,

defendant.

I believe that’s another matter.
QUESTION:

What happens in practice —

The lav/ does exclude them as of now in

Louisiana, in the sense that you're talking about.
MR. KING: That's what v/e say is so vicious* is the
exclusionary device by law.
QUESTION: Well, but is not the peremptory
challenge in operation sometimes a mode of exclusion by
operation of law?
MR. KING:

Correct, Your Honor, but that's a right

that's granted to all alike; the peremptory challenge.
QUESTION: Well, not necessarily all alike, sometimes
one side is given more peremptory challenges than the other.
In some States.
MR* KING:

But only in a numerical fashion, it's

not meant to be a device that can be used to exclude segments
from the community.
QUESTION: Well, are you standing in any degree on
the proposition that women, as a category, might be more
compassionate toward a defendant,
MR. KING:
QUESTION;
defendants?

I believe that's ~
or have a different attitude toward

12

MR. KINGs
studies xnade of that.

I can't say that.

I knew there have been

In 1948 I represented a defendant who

was accused of murder in New Orleans, on which jury served
the first woman juror in the history of the State on a capital
case.

And I would say that she was sympathetic, by my own

personal experience.
Rut that's a matter of conjecture, Your Honor, and
I —
QUESTION;

What happened in that case?

MR, KINGs

Pardon?

QUESTION: ?7hat do you mean, what happened in that
case?
MR, KINGs
of manslaughter.

He was found guilty of a lesser charge

And after the case, the jurors were

questioned.

QUESTION:
. MR, KING:

Unh-hunh.
She happened to be the president of the

League of Women Voters, and volunteered for jury service,
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. KINGs

But I didn’t know it at the time.

She

was the first woman in the State of Louisiana, in 1948»
QUESTION:

In a capital case?

MR, KINGs

Pardon?

QUESTION:

In a capital case, that's what you mean.

MR. KING:

In a capital case.

.13

And in answer to questions after the case# it
appeared that she had a greater sense of justice# fair play
and compassion than the men sitting on the jury,
QUESTION;

I wouldn't be surprised that you should

think that# v/hen they reduced it from first-degree murder to
manslaughter.
MR. KING;

Well# Your Honor asked# and that's the

only way I can answer the question# is by my own personal
experience.
QUESTION;

Mr. King# your client here# Billy Taylor#

was convicted of what# aggravated kidnapping# —
MR. KING;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.
Was the victim a man or a woman?

MR. KING: The victim was a woman.
QUESTION;

Unh-hunh.

MR. KING;

The victim was a woman# her daughter

and the woman's son# small son.
QUESTION; Three victims?
MR. KING:

Three victims.

But within the charge# and part of the evidence
introduced# was that of aggravated rape of the mother at
knife-point.
QUESTION;

Unh-hunh.

In the Hoyt case# of course# the woman# Mrs, Hoyt
had killed her husband# as I remember# —

MR. KING %

With a baseball bat*

QUESTION:

Unh-hunh

beating him over the head with

a baseball bat, and her implicit claim was that women would be
more understanding of her actions than men»

Women jurors.

You don't have any stich claim here, do you?
MR. KINGs

No, sir.

I could not honestly, and

intellectually I couldn't make that statement.

But I believe

in the Hoyt case it was first an equal protection case —
QUESTION:

Here the defendant, Billy Taylor, was a

man and the, two out of the three victims were women, really.
Is that right?
MR, KING:

Correct.

QUESTIONs

Now, and you're not *— you're not making

the claim explicitly or implicitly" that women would be more

sympathetic to the defendant intrinsically than men —*
MR, KING;

In all honesty, I couldn't say that.

QUESTION:

**- in this case ?

MR. KING:

I couldn't say

QUESTIONs

Unlike Hoyt.

MR, KINGs

No, sir, I'm not saying that,

I just wanted to be sure.
I know

there have been studies made that have reached that conclusion e
by certain educators.
QUESTION: What conclusion?
MR, KING:

That women are more sympathetic than men.

QUESTION:

In rape cases and kidnapping cases?

15
MR. KINGs

In that, type of case.

There have been

studies by scholars to that effect. But I have to say it’s
conjecture, and I really don’t have any tangible evidence of
that.
There is that school of thought.
QUESTION: Then you are making the claim?
MR. KING:
it.

Only in so far as the Court can recognize

I can’t give any
?

QUESTION:
one could say.

In Hoyt it was a very colorable claim,,

But are you making any such similar claim

in this case, on the circumstances of this case?
MR. KING:

If the Court asks —

QUESTION:

Can be the argument that was made in

MR, KING:

I can only make the argument, without

proof.
QUESTION: Well, are you making it or aren't you?
That’s all I’m asking.
MR. KING:

I would like to be able to make that

argument, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, that's —

HR, KING: But I have no proof.
QUESTION:

You’d like to be able to make lots of

arguments -MR. KING:

I have no tangible evidence of that

16
QUESTION:

Mr» King, when we used to try jury cases,

where I practiced, we used to follow a maxim, which is perhaps
an old wives’ tale, that "woman is man's best friend, but her
own worst enemy”, and the idea was if you had a male client
you wanted a bunch of women on the jury, and if you had a
woman client you wanted a bunch of men on the jury»
I take it, in your area they don't follow any such
handy maxims.
QUESTIONs But you can’t in Louisiana, can you?
MR. KING:

I have to say again I have no proof of

that, Your Honor.
QUESTION ;

Doesn't have a chance — you don't, have

a chance, do you?
QUESTION; Right.
QUESTION;

Well, when you have applied for consent (?)

women jurors, you at least have some access.
MR, KING:

On the jury venire.

QUESTION;

On the venire0

MR, KING;

On the jury venire you have that.

QUESTION; Does the record show hew many are actually
used?

What's the rata of it?
MR. KING;

The record shows that in 170 — oh, 13

women were included in a total of 1850 names drawn for the
petit jury system.terns.
Nov/, in Washington Parish, which is the parish above

17
St. Tammany, and part of the same judicial district, only
one woman has ever been known to volunteer for jury service,
and there have never been any women appear on the petit jury.
QUESTION:

You just ‘want the chance to keep them or

strike them as the particular case fits your needs, is that it?
MR, KINGs They should be available for jury service,
without the volunteer system.

That's a failure»

The volunteer

system is a complete failure»
It cannot no more work for the women than it would
for the men.

And I don't believe the Court would approve of

a volunteer system of jury service blanketwide, a blanket
volunteer — that wouldn't work.

You'd have no juries

whats oever,
QUESTION:

You think it's a necessary corollary

that the Court -would have to approve under Hoyt a voluntary
system for men only?
MR* KING:

I believe that vrould be the same —

in order to acknowledge that that’s a proper system for
women, the Court would have to acknowledge that that would
also be a proper system for men.
And it doesn’t work.
I have never ever seen a man volunteer for jury
service, who enjoyed an exemption under our law»

The

exemptions in Louisiana, the particular exemptions in
Louisiana are personal, but I've never seen one mail volunteer.

18
So it's not really a mark against, women that only
ten percent have volunteered.
the circumstances.

That's incredible, really, under

Because I've never seen a man volunteer

who enjoyed an exemption.
QUESTION;
MR, KING;

Are the exemptions waivable?
The exemptions given to men are waivable,

yes.
QUESTION;

I mean a man could volunteer?

MR, KING;

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION;

Unh-hunh,

MR, KING;

They are.

Now, in Hoyt, I believe that was an equal protection
case.

But I believe the contention made in that case was

specifically that there weren't women on the particular jury
that tried the —QUESTION;

Well, I think it was — wasn't it a

due process case?
MR, KING;
corrected.

It was an equal

excuse me, I'll stand

I just felt, from my memory, it was;,
QUESTION;
MR, KING:

Unh-hunh.
But in that case the contention was made

that that woman was entitled to women on the jury,
QUESTION:

Well, she was entitled, or the claim was,

to a system that would treat women the same way as man, in
so far as jury service went.

19
MR. KING;

I recall language that stated the core

of the case,
QUESTION s

Unh-hunh.

MR. KINGs

I may be mistaken.

The core of the Hoyt

case was the demand that there be women on the jury.

That

that type of crime demanded the compassion of women on the
jury.
QUESTION: Well, that’s — in any event, your claim
is that you’re entitled to a

you and all criminal

defendants in Louisiana are entitled to a system that cells
women and men, equally, to jury duty»
MR. KING;

Gives a fair possibility.

QUESTION:

Right.

MR» KING:

Yes, sir.

Now, the arguments made by Mrs. Ginsburg relating
to the women as a discernible group are equally applicable
here, and I won't burden the Court, the time it takes to
repeat, even though I couldn’t repeat them, that argument in
as sound a fashion as Mrs. Ginsburg.

I will adopt those

arguments.
QUESTION:

The State would be free, I take it, to

set its own age limits for men and women, as long as they
treated them in the same way, would they not?
Suppose ~~
MR, KING;

From the standpoint of equal protection,

20
that*s probably correct»
QUESTION:

Let me suggest a hypothetical.

Suppose

they said people over thirty and over and seventy and under,
for both men and women? would that give you any problems?
MR, KING:

Yes, sir, I believe that it would»

Because what reason would there be for the people thirty to
twenty not being able to serve on juries?

What possible

rationality would there be behind that?
As a matter of fact, a defendant within the twenty and
thirty age group could well complain of that, I would think.
Thank you,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll resume after lunch,

[Whereupon, at 12:00 noon, the Court was recessed,
to reconvene at 1:00 p»m,, the same day.]

21

AFTERNOON SESSION
[1:02 p.m.]
ME. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You're saving the

balance of your time for rebuttal, I take it?
MR. KING:

If there are no further questions,

Mr. Chief Justice.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Yes.

Mr. Vick.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENDALL L. VICK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. VICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
In June of this year, this Court, speaking through
Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in Michigan vs. Tucker, said:

The

3.aw does not require that a defendant receive a perfect trial,
only a fair one.
It has been said at least three times this morning,
and undoubtedly hundreds of times in thi3 chamber:

Is it

fair?
I would also beg the Court to ask, in this case:
Was it unfair?

Was Taylor's trial unfair?

And, if so, how?

Counsel for the appellant Taylor has not given the
Court any help in answering this question, except that the
absence of woman in this case is a, per se, grounds for
reversal.

A case involving aggravated kidnap, aggravated rape,

22

and arraed robbery of a women in the presence of her daughter
and small child.
As Mr* Justice Harlan said in Hoyt, that it is really
within the realm of conjecture whether one gets a jury to his
liking or not, depending of course on the venire? and I
concede that the percentage of women is very small.
But counsel for the appellant, in his brief, and in
oral argument, has sidestepped at every foot of the way the
guidance of Hoyt.
We have followed Hoyt, we have done what we thought
was proper in following the guidelines set down in Hoyt.
The only case that gives us any problem whatsoever
in the cases cited by appellant is Kiff.
But I would like to just quickly skip over the ones
he has cited:

Alexander — race.

federal question:

women on jury.

Except for Ballard —
Ho doubt about it.

But

not applicable to the States,
Carter — race.

Duncan — race.

administrative convenience? no race, but sex.

Frontiaro —
Hoyt, Kiff —

I will get to in a moment.
Reed ~~ administrative convenience? and sex.
San Antonio Independent School District — race.

Smith vs.

Texas — race.
Thiel, which we discussed this morning — no
applicability here.

And Williams

-- race.

23

Now,
QUESTION;

Which one, no applicability here?

MR. VICK:

Thiel vsa Southern Pacific»

QUESTION: What was that about?
MR. VICK:

That was the daily wage earners being

excluded.
QUESTION:
MR, VICK s

Class, ye3.
Yes.

Now, I have searched Peters vs. Kff f, I have not
found one mention of Hoyt.
Ballard, in footnote 12.

Justice Marshall alludes to only
He could have bruised Hoyt, perhaps,

he could have given soma indication in the States that he
was unhappy with Hoyt.
admonition.

Perhaps we could have had some other

But nothing.

Silence.

In footnote 12 only

reference is to Ballard.
Now, the problem with this case, .as the State of
Louisiana sees it, is that there was no lawless law enforcement
here.

There is no map question here.

No Miranda question here,

as there was in Tucker_vs. Michigan, dr the applicability of
Miranda.

There was no lawless law enforcement, for which

law enforcement should be penalized.
'The State of Louisiana went by the rules set down in
Hoyt.
Nov/, if the Court in its wisdom remands this case,
I just wonder — it’s again in the realm of conjecture — but

24
I wonder if there are women on the jury# in a case involving
women, the victim of an anus crime, whether the other side of
the coin might not come into play, that that's prejudice
that there are women on the jury.
And more than one, five or six or more.

And that's

a hanging jury.
So I don't knot-7 how the State of Louisiana can win
in this sort of — in this sort of context,
QUESTION: Are there any cases in this Court with
respect to federal juries, that hold that part of the concept
of a Sixth Amendment jury is a fair cross-•'section?
MR, VICK;

The cases cited in both briefs --

QUESTION; Do they actually hold that?

Do they

hold that to satisfy the Sixth Amendment right to a jury
trial, you must have a fair cross-section of the community?
MR, VICK;

Well, I would thin]-; that Ballard held

that.
However — however, if the Court please, I want to
retract that.

Ballard, I think, was exercising supervision.

This Court exercising supervision.
QUESTION:
Amendment.

Well, I’m talking about Sixth

I'm talking about the Sixth Amendment,
MR. VICK;

Not that I know of, Your Honor„

But it's alluded to, because of the applicability of
the Sixth Amendment through the Fourteenth Amendment.

25

QUESTIONS Duncan — that wasn't particularly the
issue in Duncan, but Duncan said that a federal jury was a
fair cross-section type of jury.
MR, VICKs

Was not.

QUESTION: But do you knew of any other cases that
talk about a fair cross-section?
MR, VICK:

Not directly on point, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Kiff gives you some trouble about that,

with respect to a grand jury?
MR, VICK:

Yes, it does give me some trouble, and

especially the —
QUESTION: The plurality opinion — I mean Mr,
Justice Marshal's opinion?
MR, VICK:
QUESTION:

Yes,
Is there any allegation anywhere in this

case that jury commissioners, or other State officials,
systematically sought to discourage or exclude the presence
of women on juries in any way?
MR. VICK:

None, Mr, Chief Justice.

As a matter of

fact, I think that the counsel for the appellant has conceded
that.
The only issue here is women* being systematically
excluded, as it were, from this jury.
That concludes my remarks, Mr, Chief Justice and
may it please the Court

27
QUESTION: Well# is there a case -- is there a case
which does hold# does have that holding in it?
MR» KING:

No# sir.

As I say# 'I think this is the

case which squaraly presents the issue to the Court.
QUESTION:

It is now# of course, a federal policy#

is it not, to undertake to see that every jury represents a
i

cross-section?
MR6 KING:

Correct.

QUESTION:

It’s

MR. KING:

a statute.

Statutory for federal courts.

And the

Court has held in due process cases — not held, but there
has been much language in the due process cases which would
have required a representative cross-section on the jury,
even without the application of the Sixth Amendment,
QUESTION:

The essence of your

the heart of your

case is that the Hoyt case is wrong and should be overruled,
was wrongly decided; is that it?
MR. KING:

That's part of it, yes.

QUESTION:

What else is -there?

MR* KING:

The second phase of it.is that the jury,

even though the complainaing party, such as Taylor, is not a
member of the excluded class, that he has a right to have that
vindicated, that there is no representative cross-section of
the community from which the jtiry can be chosen,
QUESTION:

Well, that's just another way of saying

28

that every person, independent of sex or race, has a constitu­
tional right to a, what you call a cross-section jury?
MR. KING*

As far as possible.

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. KING:

Without any arbitrary exclusion.

Particularly of such a large class as that involved here.
QUESTION:

Then, when you put it that way,

arbitrary exclusion, you must of necessity carry the burden
or you must of necessity be saying that to allow a women
preferential exemption is an arbitrary exclusion?
MR, KING:

Yes, sir.

And we feel --

QUESTION:

Would you care to enlarge on that a

little bit?
MR, KING:

Your Honor mentioned a burden.

We feel

that in view of the fact' that the appellant in this case has
a .constitutional right to an impartial jury under the Sixth
Amendment for application through the Fourteenth Amendment,
the burden of showing that there is a compelling State
interest for that exclusion falls not cn us but on the State.
Because Taylor had been deprived, in our opinion, of
a fundamental constitutional right.
QUESTION:

Mr. King, can you prevail unless we

overrule Hoyt?
MR, KING:

I believe it would be difficult to reach

a decision without *— I mean favorable to Taylor, without

29

overruling that part of Hoyt, which sustained the constitution­
ality of the exclusion statute, and constitutional provisions
of the State of Louisiana.
QUESTIONi

To that extent, yes.

Well, if Hoyt raised only a due process

issue, or only an equal protection issue, that isn’t the
issue you're raising?
MR. KING:

No, sir.

Our only issue is --

QUESTION 5

The issue you’re raising is

MR. KING:

— the Sixth Amendment, clue process.

QUESTION:

—* the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment

MR. KING:

Correct,

issue.

woven

But Hoyt, of course, is inter-

I mean what they said in Hoyt.
QUESTION: And you’re not even raising a biased or

an unfair due process issue?
MR. KING:

No, sir.

This is — a jury, pure and

simply the quality of the jury.
QUESTION:

Now, if either one of those issues was

not in —- or if your issue was not in Hoyt, maybe Hoyt stands
on its own two feet, but because Hoyt was pre-Duncan»
MR. KING:

That could be.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Vick.
