ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM L. PATTON
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT IN No. 73-1072
MR. PATTON:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

These cases are submitted on direct appeal from

the judgment of a three-judge court sitting in the Western
District of Arkansas.

That court set aside orders of the

interstate Commerce Commission granting certificates of
convenience and necessity to three motor carriers for service
between points in southeastern and southwestern States.
The United States and the Commission bring this
appeal because we believe that the district court erroneously
relying on this Court’s decision in Overton Park has misapplied
the Administrative Procedure Act in a fashion which funda­
mentally alters the scope of review of administrative findings.
And because of limitations of time, I do not intend to dis­
cuss the prior history of these cases in detail.
is set forth at pages 3 through 3 of our brief.

That history

I do, however, want to make a few brief comments
about the prior proceedings.
old.

These cases are now nine years

They originally involved ten applications for motor

carrier service in the area generally lying to the east of
Houston, Dallas, and Forth Worth, Texas, and to the west of
Atlanta, Georgia; Birmingham, Alabama; and Pensacola, Florida.
Hearings began on these consolidated applications
in early 1966.

They were held before two examiners in eight

cities, primarily in tile Southeast.

Hearings consumed 149

days and over 900 witnesses appeared and testified in support
of the applications with some 60 witnesses testifying in
opposition.

Sixty-six rail and motor carriers appeared as

protestants to the application.
The transcript of the proceedings exceeds 23,000
pages, and the documentary exhibits number almost 2,000.
This was, as the Commission found, probably the most
extensive record ever compiled in a motor carrier operating
license case.
In November of 1969, the Examiners rendered their
report recommending that all of the applications be denied.
Exceptions were taken to their report and the case was
considered by the Commission, Division 1.
On December 30, 1971, the Commission issued its
decision finding that present or future public need justified
the

grant of three of the certificates, and accordingly

certificates of convenience and necessity were granted to
three carriers —- Red Ball, Bowman, and Johnson.
In September of 1972 motions for reconsideration
were denied by the Commission by a two-to-one vote, and a
petition that the case be heard by the entire Commission as
involving a matter of general transportation importance was
also denied.
In October of 1972, 19 protestants filed suit in the
district court, and approximately a year later, in September
1973, the district court set aside the Commission orders
finding that the Commission's evaluation of certain of the
evidence was arbitrary and capricious.
Before discussing the scope of review question, I
would like tc deal with one preliminary matter. At page 1310
of the appendix, in conclusion 11 of the district court's
opinion, the district court finds that the Commission's
decision fails to meet the requisites of clarity.
QUESTION:

There are two volumes to the appendix.

I have only one.
QUESTION:
MR. PATTON:

Page 1310.

Finding 11?

Finding 11, yes, sir.

The court find3 the Commission's decision fails to
meet the requisites of clarity, and as an illustration it
says that they cannot determine whether the Commission rejected
or approved the Examiners' principal findings.

7
The district court’s finding.is clearly wrong.
The Commission's ultimate conclusions and subordinate findings
are set forth in its opinion.

Its ultimate conclusions appear

at page 158 to 160 of the appendix, and its subordinate
findings appear as follows:

The Commission, like the Examiners,

determined that all the applicants were fit and able to
perform the service.

That finding appears at page 121 of the

appendix.
The Commission differed with the Examiners on whether
there was a public need for the service authorized, and the
Commission's findings appear at pages 123 to 131 of the
appendix.
Mow, the district court's conclusion, is based in
part on its labeling the appendices to the Examiners' and
Commission's report as findings.

They are not findings.

Those

appendices contain summaries of the testimony and exhibits
.introduced in this case.

They contain no inferences or

conclusions drawn through the evidence.

And I think the

clearest indication that they are not findings is that no
party to this case objected to them.

The district court

found that they present a comprehensive summary of the
evidence.

We believe they do and they are not findings of

fact.
Now, in considering the scope of review question,
it is important to keep in mind what this case does and does

8
.and does not involve.

There is no question here of the

Commission's statutory authority to issue certificates of the
legal criteria governing the issuance of such certificates or
of the propriety procedures used by the Commission.

The only

question is whether the Commission erred in finding that there
is a present or future need for the service proposed.

That

is an essentially factual question, and the judicial review
of the Commission's ‘determination is, in our view, governed
by the substantial evidence test.
Our position as to the scope of review is this;
Judicial review of the evidentiary basis of findings made on
a record after hearing is governed by the substantial evidence
test.

The arbitrary and capricious test does not apply.

That is not to say that the arbitrary and capricious test has
no application in an adjudicatory proceedings.

As we say in

our brief, there are many actions taken in such proceedings
that would be subject to the arbitrary and capricious test.
But it is not basically an evidentiary test.

The arbitrary

and capricious test is really directed at review of
discretionary policy decisions.

It is less stringent than

the substantial evidence test.
Now, our position as to the proper application of
judicial review is best illustrated by discussing a
certificate of convenience and necessity case such as this
one.

Judicial review would proceed as follows.

The court

9
would first ask whether the Commission has considered, all
relevant factors.

And the factors relevant to a grant of a

certificate of convenience and necessity are provided by
statute, by section 307 of the Interstate Commerce Act, which
is set out at page 95 of the appendix.
Section 307 provides that the Commission shall issue
a certificate if it finds (1) that the applicant is fit and
able to perforat the service, and (2) that there is a present
or future need for the service.
As I have indicated, the Commission made those
findings in this case.
The next question would be whether the Commission's
finding
evidence.

as to those factors is supported by substantial
And the district court did not apply this substantial

evidence test in this case.

Rather, it held that a mere

review of the sufficiency of the evidence is not enough where
agency findings are alleged to be arbitrary and capricious.
It consider the arbitrary and capricious test a more stringent
test than tha substantial evidence test, and it clearly viewed
the test as permitting it to

weigh the evidence.

Now, appellees say that the district court did not
weigh the evidence, that it simply reviewed the Commission’s
treatment of the evidence.

Rut the district court ~~

QUESTION ; Will we have to read these 42,000 pages?
MR. PATTON;

You will not, Mr. Justice Marshall; no,

10
sir.

And let me explain why.

This is an error of law.

We

think it is a clear misapplication of the standard of review.
In fact, the complaint in this case never alleged that the
decision was not supported by substantial evidence.

And this

massive record is summarized in the appendices to the
Commission's report, and there is really no dispute about
what the evidence said.

The question is over inferences drawn

from the evidence, and that involves weighing it.

That is

something for the Commission.
QUESTION?
what do we do?

Mr. Patton, if we were to agree with you,

Remand to the three-judge court to apply the

proper te3t?
MR. PATTON:

Mr. Justice Brennan, we believe that

the case should be remanded with directions to dismiss the

complaint.

We recognize that this Court frequently when

standard of review is misapplied does remand for further
proceedings under the proper standard.
QUESTION:

Is there any occasion for considering

remanding to the Commission?
MR. PATTON:

I don't believe so, Mr. Chief Justice.

I think that would only arise if you agreed with the district
court, and there, as we have said in cur brief, we think that
the case should have been remanded to the Commission,if the
district court had been correct,for further proceedings before
the Commission.

But at this stage, I think the case should

11
either be sent back for further proceedings consistent with
this Court’s opinion or with directions to dismiss the
complaint.
QUESTION;

I don't understand the latter.

If, in

fact, they should have and did not apply the substantial
evidence test, how can we get them to dismiss?
MR. PATTON;

Mr. Justice Brennan, of course, the

Court would ordinarily not apply it on its own motion unless
it were asked to review the findings.
QUESTION;

Well, can we?

Is that not the responsibility

of a three-judge court under the statutory
MR. PATTON:
QUESTION;
MR. PATTON;

It ordinarily is.
Not ordinarily, always.
Well, there are cases where this Court

has made some determination.

For example, the Illinois

Railroad case which is at 385 United States Reports, where a
case has gone on a long time, where it is clear from the opinion
and from things in the appendix that, the decision is supported
by substantial evidence, there is no need to send it back.
QUESTION;

As I get what you are saying is that the

issue isn’t even in the case about substantial evidence.
MR. PATTON:
QUESTION;

That is correct.
If you say the district court was wrong

on the standard it used, what you in effect are saying is that
the fact that there is subs taxi tial evidence is accepted by the

12

other side. They didn’t raise it.
MR. PATTON:
QUESTION;

They did not raise it, but —If that isn't your position, then, we,

ourselves, you are suggesting, would have to look at the
record and decide about substantial evidence.
MR. PATTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, that is right.
But don’t you also say that the district

court, in effect, conceded there was substantial evidence
but said there is something more needed?
MR. PATTON:
says a mere review
enough.

That is correct, because its finding, it

of sufficiency of the evidence is not

Now, to be perfectly candid about it, Mr. Justice

Relinquish, there are some conclusion in. the district court
opinion which are ambiguous.
ray position too far,
QUESTION:

So that I don’t want to press

But substantial evidence was not alleged.
Technically, you think then it would

not ba acceptable just to say the issue of substantial evidence
isn’t in the case. And then we either have to remand to
determine it

or determine it ourselves.

MR. PATTON:

I believe that is correct, Mr. Justice

White.
Now, there isn’t any doubt that the district court
weighed the evidence in this case, and you don't have to look
any further than again page 1310 of the appendix, look at
conclusion 12 where the district court says that the Division

13
could not weigh the evidence under the substantial evidence
test, but it has held that it may avoid that limitation simply
by invoking the arbitrary and capricious test.
decision must be reversed for that reason.

We think its

Surely Congress

did not intend to prohibit weighing the evidence under one
provision of the Administrative Procedure Act and permit it
under another one.
Unless the Court has any questions.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Patton.

Mr. Rhyne.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES S. RIIYNE ON
BEHALF OF APPELLANTS IN NOS. 73-1055,
73-1963, 73-1070, and 73-1071
MR. RHYNE:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I would like first to address myself directly to

the question raised by Mr. Justice White.

I have here the

complaint that was filed by the appellees in the court balovr.
And when they come to the point of telling what was wrong,
they speak of the Commission giving substantial evidence, the
wrong evidence, they think, and they go to the next paragraph,
substantial evidence, no weight.
evidence.

Go On down, substantial

On over, substantial evidence, substantial evidence.
Now, they started out, never once do they — I mean,

they say substantial weight, I am sorry.

They gave substantial

weight, substantial weight, substantial weight,

never once

14
mentioning substantial evidence.
So actually, their complaint doesn’t state a valid
legal reason to set aside the Commission’s decision.

And so

I would certainly urge, and I will come back to that in a
moment, that the proper action for this Court is to send it
back with instructions to dismiss because they raised no legal
objection to the Interstate Co?nmerce Commission's decision.
Now, I come into this case representing shippers.
And in this particular forum I am also representing the
three carriers who were authorized to carry out the service
which the Interstate Commerce Commission authorized but the
court below took away.
These shippers first came into this case after the
Hearing Examiners handed in their report and turned down all
service to everyone.

And from the very outset the shippers

then who came in as parties to fight for the service then
have focused on the monopoly

the competitive situation.

Nov;, this is in brief the way I see the motor
carrier

...

they are talking about.

The southeastern

carriers come down through North Carolina and South Carolina,
all this burgeoning area of the United. States, they go over
to Birmingham, to Memphis, and to New Orleans, and they have
to unload there.

And then the southwestern carriers who come

in from points west, Dallas, Houston, they come in and pick
up the packages and take them on to the Southwest.

And this

15
was kind of grandfathered in in 1946, and of course the
services have increased a lot since then.
But the biggest thing that the shippers -- and there
has never been a case where there were so many shippers came
out to testify.

Nine hundred thirty-three shippers testified

orally in this caser out of 1009 witnesses who testified.

So

you can see how enormously important it is to the shippers
and their coming in here as parties, I think, demonstrates that
as much as anything else.

So they wanted to break through

these gateways; that is their big argument, they want single
line service.

There is vary little breakthrough in those

gateways now, and most of these major carriers that come down
to the Southeast and go into Birmingham, Memphis, Atlanta,
and New Orleans, they just stop there.

They can't go on.

And what these shippers wanted was a breakthrough and the break­
down of the whole monopoly situation.
So we asked the Commission to face up to this and
we took exception to the Examiners who said, Well, we see
monopolistic tendencies but they didn’t do anything about it.
And we urged the Commission to do something about it.
So what did the Commission do?

The Commission

spent about a year regrouping the evidence in this case.

It’s

set forth .in Exhibit E, it’s an appendix to the opinion.

I'm

sorry, it's 130~something pages, you need a microscope to read
it, but it’s because the evidence is so massive of the shippers

16

But the Hearing Examiners had assembled this evidence according
to commodities and kind of broke it up, someone said, atomised
the whole thing.

And so that didn!t show the picture.

But

when the Commission itself regrouped the evidence according to
points where the shippers were demanding more service, why, it
was quite clear where the points were and what the service
was, and it also helped the Commission in deciding which of
the carriers could furnish that service.
So I say the shippers came in here pushing hard on
monopoly.

Wow, the court below said this is politics, not

judicial.

Well, 1 say it’s policy, policy, and that the policy

agency in this whole case is the Interstate Commerce Commission,
not the court.

I think if there is any one thing that epitomizes

what the court did below, it's what happened to the Waiter-Logan
bill as compared to the Administrative Procedure Act.

The

President vetoed the Walter-Logan bill because, above everything,
it wiped out the expertise of administrative agencies.
in there true clearly erroneous rule.

It had

And so the President

vetoed it on the ground that all of the expertise, the specialised
knowledge, and at least in the agencies’case, the uniqueness
was being wiped, and all the agencies would be, would be simply
fact assemblers for the courts, and all the courts would have
to reweigh the evidence under the clearly erroneous rule like
they can do in a bench trial.
And that’s what this court did here.

It never

17
mentioned or considered the expertise of the Interstate
Commerce Commission in focusing up on the competitive situation,
in allowing the breakthrough in these gateways.

That *s

the big thing the Interstate Commerce Commission did.
Now, in the court below, their major error not only
was reweighing the evidence — and I agree with Mr. Patton,
that’s what they did — but they treated this case as a
buttle between carriers, forgetting that in every administra­
tive agency hearing of this kind the public interest is a .
party, and the public interest is the biggest interest, and
that’s the interest to which the Interstate Commerce Commission
responded here.

They would have been derelict in their duties

not to have responded to this tremendous outpouring of shippers
saying what is wrong with the service they have now.

They

pointed out that it took sometimes anywhere from 2 to 15 days
to get their goods through these gateways.

They wanted to

break down the barriers and have single line service between
these great growing areas of the United States, the Southeast
and the Southwest.
So when the court treated this as a battle between
carriers and focused only on the evidence that was favorable
to the appellees, they didn't get the fair view of what the
case was all about.

They never once looked at the findings

of the Interstate Commerce Commission as to need.

And I

submit that they are so ovewhelming that no one can say that

10
substantial evidence doesn't exist.
talk about, the xveight.

And that's why they

That’s why in their coxoplaint they

talk about the substantial weight.
They talked about substantial weight there, and then
in the findings and opinion of the court itself they talk about
late, inferior evidence, superior evidence, all that kind of
tiling.

And now here they talk about treatment of the evidence.

But I sincerely urge upon this Court that unless you want to
wipe out the expertise of the administrative agencies, unless
you want the courts of this land to weigh the evidence of
every administrative proceeding, this case must be reversed.
I give one illustration of the type of thing that
you are faced with in looking at what the court below did.
The very first thing they talk about here is the court said
that the Commission didn't give proper weight to a summary of
shipper evidence prepared by one of the parties, one of the —
it's not an appellee here, but one of the parties below, East
Texas, made a summary of the shipper evidence which they said
was favorable to them.

And they say it's applying a double

standard because in this case the Commission looked at all of
the shipper evidence and found some of it favorable to the
appellants, but didn't say anything about this exhibit.
Well, for Heaven's sake, that's Exhibit No. 1,339,
according to their complaint.

!>Tow, no court, no agency, has

to mention every partisan brief that is presented to them.

19
I think the Commission certainly didn’t apply a double
standard when it went to all the trouble to regroup all of
the evidence, and to .state it according to geographic points
which there just can’t be any doubt when you do that, the need
points stand out, and also the carriers who could supply the
service stand out.
The interesting thing to me is that the court
V

t

below never even considered the need.

They just wiped out

the service that these people had corae in here to fight for.
'fhey never oven considered the Commission's findings as to
these carriers and why it was that they chose them.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Rhyne, a district court does have

to make up its own mind as to whether there is substantial
evidence, I suppose,
MR. RIIYNEs
QUESTION:

Well —
And just some evidence isn't enough, is

it?
MR. RHYNE;

What the district court did was, it

focused only on the appellee’s evidence, and it didn’t talk
about substantial evidence ever.

They would say, this little

bit of the appellee’s evidence, this little summary exhibit,
was presented and the Commission doesn't mention it in its
opinion, so therefore it didn’t consider it.

.And that’s

applying a double standard because you look at the shippers’
evidence that applied to appellants and you didn't look at

20
the shippers' evidence that we pointed out to you.
QUESTION;

I know, but there is soiae suggestion in

your argument that it's wrong for the district court to weigh
the evidence.
MR. RHYNE;
QUESTIONs

Yes, I think it is wrong.
Well, they have got to decide whether

it's substantial.
MR. RHYNE;

Well, I don’t think they have to Weigh

it to look at the record and find out whether it's substantial.
Nov;, if there is no evidence at all, that’s kind of easy for
them „
QUESTION;

Well, but just any evidence isn’t enough

either, is it?
MR. RHYNE;

No.

Oh, no, it has to be substantial

substantial or not.

Now, they don’t say whether those are

And our distinguished adversaries say

the court below didn't say whether they were substantial evidence,
they didn't say whether it was there or not.
Now, we urge upon you that the only consideration
before that court is to take a look and see 'whether there is
substantial evidence.
Now, the big point -QUESTION;

You make that argument in contradistinction

21
to the idea that the court should reweigh the evidence and see
1

whether the Commission weighed it correctly.

You say the

function of the court is limited to determining whether there
is substantial evidence that supports the result it reached.
Is that correct?
MR, RHYME %

And if there is, the court's function is

over.
QUESTIQMs
MR. RHYNE:

That's not a reweighing function, is it?
No, it's a looking at the evidence to

see whether there is substantial evidence,

I suppose you have

to weigh it a little bit to see whether it's substantialp but ■
QUESTION:

It is not the same kind of a function as

the primary trier engages in.
MR. RHYNE:
see.

No.

And that's what they did here, you

They conducted themselves as a primary trier here.

So the peculiarity about this case is that they don't even
mention the substantial evidence, the court doesn't, the
complaint doesn't, and I corae back to the fact that since they
didn’t initially complain that substantial evidence doesn't
exist, they admit that it does, and the proper action for
tills Court is to send it .back with instructions to dismiss

It doesn't

raise a legal basis for court review.
They asked the court to weigh all the evidence,
and over and over again they talk about substantial weight,

22

not giving substantial weight, or giving substantial weight»
Now, that is not a proper, legal appeal from an
order of the Interstate Commerce Commission.
Now, above all, on this remand, let me say this
from tlie viewpoint of shippers:
since 1965.

This case has been under way

If this case is sent back to the court or sent

baak to the Interstate Commerce Commission and you start that
process all over again, that means that these shippers have
to wait maybe 20 years, because if there is any one thing that
is demonstrated in this record, that is that the people who
don’t want a particular service can stymie things within
the administrative process of the Interstate Commerce Commission
for a long, long time,

And we feel that this Court in its

administrative capacity, looking at justice in this country,
ought to say there ought to be an end sometime and that the
time has come when the public interest should be paramount
father than the interest of these people who are disturbed
simply because they were not chosen to render the new service
or because it might interfere a little bit competitively
with them.

And we say to you that these people four times

argued all of their points before the Commission.

Their

biggest point, I suppose, is that there have been a lot of
changes in service, it’s increased during the pendency of
this case.

But the Commission considered all of that specifically

in Exhibit G.

It listed increases in footnotes and in their

23
summary of the pleadingsP it listed it.
So the Commission considered all of that.
So then when you come to the claim that you don't
need it because of these many services that have come along
since then, well, the Commission said it considered all of
that.

They talk about taking business away from existing

carriers.

That’s bad.

Diversion.

considered that and rejected it.
it’s talking about.

Well, the Commission
And it ought to know what

It said the demand for this service is

so great that a little bit of diversion is not going to matter
And if these people would do their job and furnish the service
they are not going to lose out in competition with other
carriers.
nation.

After all, competition is the life blood of this
So I don.'t apologize for having raised the issue of

monopoly and competition before the Interstate Commerce
Commission and fight it on through to this Court, because
this Court has in a number of cases said that antitrust,
competitive, monpoly principles do apply in motor carrier
cases.
So I would urge upon this Court that you not simply

because there has got. to be an end to litigation sometime.
And ten years is enough;to make these people wait even
another year is too much after waiting ten years.

There has

never been so many shippers come out to demand service in the

24

history of the Interstate Commerce Commission.

I again say

they would have been derelict in their duty if they hadn’t
found that the paramount public interest, not these various
carriers who were fighting among themselves, but the paramount
public interest demands this service and that this Court
should really in the public interest order that that service
be^ put into effect as quickly as possible.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Rhyne.

Mr. Stevens.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHINEAS STEVENS ON
BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. STEVENS:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

At the outset I believe it appropriate to put

straight two things that have been raised in oral argument.
First is the what 1 would term demurrer that my
distinguished brother has just filed to our complaint.

That’s

the first time we have ever heard that our complaint was in
any way inadequate.

Our complaint was never challenged below.

Our complaint raised the identical, issues that were ruled on
bv the court, specifically -~
QUESTION:

Where is this in the appendix?

MR. STEVENS:

It is not in the appendix.

It is in

the record,and no question had ever been raised before oral
argument here concerning the adequacy of the complaint.
We have a copy here, your Honor, and over and over

25
again the allegation of error was that the Division's order
constitutes an abuse of its discretions' constitutes arbitrary
and capricious action, and is without rational basis.
It is true we regard the substantial evidence rule
as being the rule uniquely designed to testing the propriety
of the finding of fact, the sufficiency of that finding of
fact.

Tie findings of fact are not in issue.

been in issue.

They have never

So we did not allege that any finding of fact

itself was not supported by substantial evidence.

We allege

that the treatment of these findings, the conclusions drawn
from the findings lacked the rational basis,they

were

arbitrary, they were capricious, they constituted an abuse
of discretion.
Mow, 'What are the findings of fact?

Distinguished

counsel for the Government has said, for the first time, that
the appendices do not constitute findings of fact.

That,

quite frankly, may it please the Court, comes as a surprise.
They are the findings of fact.

They are the findings of fact

in the Examiners' report, and in the Division report.
what are they?

And

He says they are summaries of evidence, but

I do not know what a summary of evidence is unless it is a
finding of fact.
QUESTION;

Is there some difference, Mr. Stevens,

between deciding whether a particular witness may have spoken
would
truthfully and then going on from that to make what you/call

26
findings of ultimate fact that would be the basis of the
Commission’s decision?
MR. STEVENS:

The latter, your Honor, is what I

would call a conclusion drawn from the facts.

What the witness

said is not in dispute.
QUESTION:

But what Rule 50 of Federal Rules of

Civil Procedure would call findings of fact and you would
call ultimate conclusions.
MR. STEVENS:

No, I do not know that, your Honor.

I think that I would call findings of fact the statements as
to what the witnesses said, what the exhibits establish as
set forth in the appendices to the report.

And there is no

difference as to what the witnesses said, what the exhibits
said.
QUESTION:

Well, that’s really no more than a

concession, that none of them lied, isn't it?
MR. STEVENS:

Ho, it's not just a question of

testing of credibility, but what is it?
What did they establish?

What did they say?

What did they prove in their

testimony?
Our complaint, your Honor, lies with the treatment
of that evidence, what conclusions can be drawn from those
facts.
QUESTION:

You mean you don’t think the substantial

evidence test is sufficient or adequate or intended to test out

27
the conclusion that there is a need for more service?
MR. STEVENS:

Mr. Justice White, I think, as the

court below thought, that the arbitrary or capricious standard,
arbitrary, capricious, and abuse of discretion is a test, a
standard that more suitably describes that particular -—
QUESTION:

Your answer is no to my question.

MR. STEVENS:

No, I won't go so far as to say that.

I believe that the. court could have reached every conclusion
that it reached in terms of the substantial evidence rule.
When the court said —
QUESTION:

If we disagree with the district court

in terms of arbitrary — either disagree with it that it's
applicable at all, the arbitrary and capricious test, or that
even if it is there was nothing arbitrary and capricious about
this order, the case is over as far as you are concerned.
MR. STEVENS:

Not at all, your Honor.

I would say

that every finding or conclusion of the lower court could have
been expressed in terras of lack of substantial evidence.
QUESTION:

Is there substantial evidence of need

in this record?
MR. STEVENS:
QUESTION:

No, your Honor.

Why not?

MR. STEVENS:

Because when you consider the entire

record, there is so much evidence that shows to the contrary.
QUESTION:

I didn't ask whether there was other

28

evidence; I asked was there any evidence in this record of
need»
MR» STEVENS:

Phrased in that manner, your Honor,

yes, there is some evidence.
QUESTION:

I said "substantial evidence."

MR. STEVENS:

In terms of substantial evidence, no,

your Honor.
QUESTION:

Why wasn’t it substantial?

MR. STEVENS:

Because, your Honor, you would have

to consider only, for example, the direct testimony of the
witness.

If you looked at his cross-examination and if you

looked at the evidence submitted in prote3cants and weighed
it all together, the substantiality would disappear.
QUESTION;

You just disagree with their finding.

MR. STEVENS:
QUESTION:

The court disagreed with —

That's all it was.

Are you substituting

your judgment for theirs?
MR. STEVENS:
QUESTION:

Net at all, your Honor.

You sound like it.

MR. STEVENS:

No.

What I am trying to explain is

that the way the Commission looked at this was to consider
only bits and pieces of the record.

And they said. We will

not consider the rest of the evidence —
QUESTION:

What statement do you have that says

that, that that’s what the Commission did?

29

MR. STEVENS:

Well, the principal statement, X think,

is summarised very succinctly in the reply brief that the
appellants filed just a few days ago.

They say that the

treatment of the evidence by the. Commission is fully supported
by reasonings set forth in its report and these reasonings
are illustrative of the Commission's "careful weighing of the
evidence."

That’s on page 6 of the reply brief.
QUESTION:

Pardon ras.

I don’t understand one word

of that.
MR. STEVENSi
QUESTION:

3eg pardon?

I don’t understand one word of that in

answer to my question.

Aren’t you really putting your judgment

over the Commission's?

If you were on the Commission, you

would have found otherwise, right?
MR. STEVENS:

I would have found otherwise, yes,

your Honor.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. STEVENS:
QUESTION:

Because —

Isn’t that what the district court did

in this case?
MR. STEVENS:

No, I do not think that it is because

when you look at what I was coming to, when they cite, why
did the Commission not give consideration to the evidence?
They say that that constitutes a valid reason for not giving
consi.deration to this evidence.

We say it's no reason at all.

30

It's a completely arbitrary„ unreasonable rejection of tremendous
portions of the record,,

not submitted by these applicants and have it as an ex parte

QUESTION:

If you disregard all of the evidence, then

you fall athwart of the rule of substantial and they didn't

And they gave a reason

Look, here

are all of our records that we handled for that shipper
during a period of time.
QUESTION:

He isn't correct."

Did you make all those arguments in your

exception?
MR. STEVENS:

We made all of those arguments in our

briefs before the Commission..
QUESTION:

We have made them —

And the Commission considered them.

MR. STEVENS:

The Commission did not consider them,

your honor.
QUESTION:

Didn't consider them?

MR. STEVENS:

No, sir, they did not consider them.

They rejected our petitions summarily 12 working days after
the briefs were in, with no opinion whatever.
QUESTION:

What could they do that rejected —

32
MRo STEVENS:

They overruled it»

I used the wrong term, your Honor.

I beg your pardon,

They overruled our

petitions without an opinion.
QUESTION:

So you gave all that argument there.

MR„ STEVENS:

Yes, sir.

And they did not give any

consideration to our argument.
This reason for rejecting this evidence was not a
reason assigned by any of the parties.

These parties were

represented by the most able counsel at the Commission' s bar.
They did not suggest that this was a reason, because it isn’t
a valid reason.

It lacks any logic, any justification whatever.

It is of no more reason than if the Commission had said, "I
reject this evidence because the witness that presented it
was red-headed,"

It would be no more sense to what they

said — "We reject this evidence because it relates to specific
shippers."

Of course, it related to specific shippers.

That

was the entire purpose of it, to rebut specific evidence.
One carrier alone brought in exhibits showing service rendered
for 150 shipments.

With one stroke of the pen all of that

evidence went out of the window.

That's the most important

evidence that we presented in the case.
QUESTION:

I think you would agree, Mr. Stevens,

that at least a considerable part of this case involved
evaluation of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight
to be given to particular documentary evidence.

33

MR. STEVENS:

Your Honor, no, sir, Mr. Chief Justice,

not to the credibility of the witnesses.

That is not in issue.

What the witnesses said was recorded by the Examiners, no
dispute as to that.
QUESTION:

How do you square that with the statement

that I thought you just made that they, the Commission, paid
undue attention to the direct testimony but ignored the crossexamination.

Now, isn’t that a credibility, in part, evaluation

of credibility of witnesses?
MR. STEVENS:

1 used that as an illustration because

the Commission did in fact coxxsider only that portion of the
witness' testimony, for example, that had come out on direct.
Everything that came out on cross, although that was recorded
in the Examiners' findings to which no exception was taken,
no weight was given to it, it was disregarded, that portion
of the evidence was disregarded.
But more significantly, the rebuttal evidence, all
of the evidence in opposition, was in effect thrown out of the
window by this statement that "We will not consider this
evidence as entitled to any weight for these reasons:”
Now, what tiie court said was, "Those reasons are not
valid.

We are not ourselves weighing the evidence, but we are

saying that the Commission did not weigh the evidence." The
Commission looked at only one side of the case, and when it
came to the other side of the case, it said, "We won't give

34
consideration to it for these reasons:1'

And they t\r& no

reasons at all, they are not justifications.

The court said

this is an arbitrary, capricious, it lacks a rational basis.
That is why we couched our complaint more in terms
of the first subparagraph of section 706 of the Administrative
Procedure Act rather than in subparagraph (d) relating to
substantial evidence.

It’s because that paragraph uniquely

describes the type of error that was done in this case.
The lower court said this, your Honor.

The lower

court said that the Commission did not apply the basic rudiments
of fairness, that the Commission's report indicates a
predilection to grant these particular applications followed
by a strained attempt to marshal facts to support such findings.
The strain was too much for the court to bear, and it said,
viewed in its entirely, the report sounds more in advocacy
than an impartial adjudication.
But if I may venture to say so, this isn’t good
advocacy, may it please the Court, to say, We will not give
consideration to this evidence because it relates to specific
shippers.

None of the advocates would make such a statement.

The Commission did that of its own motion, and if that is
grounds to disregard or not give weight to testimony, that
ground automatically applies to every shipper that testified
in the. case, because he testified only about his particular
traffic.

Nov;, if that is an invalid reason for considering his

evidence, it applies to all of it.
The court said that the Commission applied a
prejudicial and discriminatory double standard.

It applied

one standard to evidence presented by certain parties: when it
came to other parties, it applied a different standard.
Let me illustrate one of those instances.

In the

early part of its report, the Commission was dealing with
certain exhibits showing what the particular applicant had
been doing.

It says, You can test what I propose to do by

what I am now doing, and presented statistical data showing
that, for example, during a one-week test period in early
1966 this particular applicant was operating from Richmond
to Memphis an average of two and a half days in transit.
Well, we came in and said, what this two and a
half days in transit really means.
figure.

It is almost a meaningless

So we took those identical statistics, their figures,

and we analysed them in accordance with their proposal and
wa said, "Look here, what doss it mean?

It means that they

are performing their service, they are getting the freight on
time 55 percent of the. time."

Whereas all the witnesses

testified, they said, "That's not the type of service we want."
Yet that is the type of service that the applicant was
performing, that is the type of service the applicant says
you can test what I propose to do by what I am now doing.
Now, on page 116 of the report, the Commission made

36
a finding of fact that the applicant can do this because if
you are now operating two and a half days from Richmond to
Memphis„
Over in a subsequent part of the report, dealing with
our contention that the applicant's own exhibit showed that
they were not performing and could not perform in the manner
in which they had represented to the witnesses they would
perform, what did the Commission do there?

The Commission

says, "Proof of past performance cannot be used to test
what an applicant proposes to do."

They took the same exhibit,

the same sheet of paper, and in the early part of this report
they make certain findings based upon this exhibit.

Later on,

without apparently realising they were talking about the same
sheet of paper, they said this type of evidence is entitled
to no probative value.
That is exactly what is in this report, and the
court says that that shows a predilection to grant these
particular applications followed by a strained attempt to
marshal facts to support it.
Now, in the court below this applicant was still
urging, "Test what we propose to do by what we show we have been
doing."

The Commission had said, ”We won’t look at that test

except insofar as it is favorable.
we will not look at it.
QUESTION:

Mr. Stevens.

As to its unfavorable,

MR. STEVENS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Did Judge Miller adopt your proposed

findings of fact and conclusions pretty much verbatim?
MR. STEVENS:
Honor.

Pretty much verbatim, he did, your

What he did was during the oral arguments on the case,

counsel asked for permission to file proposed findings of fact
and conclusions of law as required by a local court ruling.
The court said, Yes, you may do so, but get them in early
because we are going to work on our decision.

All parties

then filed proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.
The appellants filed them in the form of a proposed opinion
with just signature lines for the court.

We filed them in the

more standard form, "We request the court to find this and
conclude this," and the court said, "We have considered
all of the ; proposed findings.

We find those of the plaintiff

correct and we adopt them as follows:"
Yes, it was an affirmative adoption of most of the
findings and conclusions.

However, in its opinion the court

added other things on its own, other cases and quoted from
them, v/rote an appendix that we hadn't even suggested.
As to the proper scope of review, the appellants
say that substantial evidence rule is the only rule that can
be applied in an adjudicatory proceeding, a

case that comes

before the court after an adjudicatory proceeding.
We submit that is not. a correct, statement.

It is an

38

oversimplification.

The substantial evidence rulef of course,

does apply only to adjudicatory proceedings , but it is by no
means the only rule or test that applies to adjudicatory
proceedings.

Adjudicatory proceedings must meet the standard

of constitutional requirements, statutory requirements,
procedural due process, as well as the rule that was
elaborated on in the Overton Park case, arbitrary, capricious,
and abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law.
As

stated in the Overton Park

case, in all cases, this

rule applies.

MR.

JUSTICE

DOUGLAS:

You may proceed.

I think

you have about 23 minutes left.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHINEAS STEVENS
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. STEVENS:

(Resumed)

Thank you, your Honor.

Mr. Justice Douglas, and may it please the Court:
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS:

The Chief Justice is

necessarily absent.
MR. STEVENS:

Yes, sir.

I think it may be helpful to the Court, sir, if I may
go back and review briefly a few of the facts that I neglected
to mention at the outset,
Mr. Rhyne has stated that the chief problem discussed
by these shippers was that freight came out of the East down to
certain points, then it had to change to another carrier and
go forward.

That is an oversimplification.

On certain lines

between certain points, that is correct; between other points
there was one-line service all the way through, but the
shippers would say, "We would like to have another one-line —
single-line service is the proper term ■— from A to B.

There

is not enough service from that standpoint."
First, it must be borne in mind that there isn't a
single point proposed to be served that did not have multiple

40
service at the time of the applications.

Also* it must be

borne in mind that they propose only a very highly limited
selective type of service to go through the small communities
and serve only the major communities and leave to the existing
carriers the obligation to handle the less profitable freight
to the smaller communities.
The Examiners found that the approval of any one of
these 10 applications would result in a deterioration of service
primarily to the smaller communities, but also to the larger
communities, that the public interest would be damaged by the
approval of any one of those.

The facts upon which those

findings or conclusions were based were adopted verbatim by
the Division, but they

reached a different conclusion from

those facts.

I think it might be also helpful to note that this
was not a general influx of citizens asking for service.

This

was not a general investigation by the Commission, which they
could have done.

These were individual applicants that had

sought a particular service; they were consolidated for hearing.
And we have here the most unusual situation of having .1.0 major
applications heard on one record.
One of the things that resulted in, each time an
applicant would call a witness to the stand, he would be
criticizing other applicants.

So we saw that there was no

difference really between the applicants and the protestants.

41
Also, it should be noted that these shippers were
not parties, they were witnesses»

Forty-one of them were

permitted :.o intervene as parties represented by Mr, Rhyne
after the initial decision had been made.

It was only then

that any suggestion had been made of any antitrust issue.

Up

to then the considerations by the Examiners were just the
opposite, there is so much service that it is really destructive
competition at the present time.
Also, mention has been made of the fact that the
affirmance of this case would result in denying service to
a large number of shippers.

With deference, may it please

the Court, I submit that just the contrary 'would be true.
In the first place, the most unusual aspect of this case is
that while it was pending before the Commission, there was
a massive increase in single-line service that took place
with Commission approval.
Bearing in mind that the whole theory of the case
was not that there is not sufficient service, but there is not
sufficient single-line service, the Commission found, and
all of the witnesses, all of the parties, acknowledged that
there is a direct correlation between the number of times a
shipment changes hands and the expeditiousness of the shipment.
So single-line service per se is of utmost importance.

The

entire theory of the case was predicated upon that.
So what took place was that while these cases were

42
pending before the Commissionf there were a series of mergers,
consolidations, with Commission approval, and a few new grants
of authority.

The Examiners took note of that.

For example,

they pointed out that at the time of the hearing between the
focal points of the application — Atlanta and Dallas — there
were three single-line carriers.

But at the time of their

decision in 1969 there were seven such carriers.

The

Examiners said, giving effect to the present sean/ice available,
bearing in mind the statutory criteria to determine the present
and future public convenience and necessity, we find that there
is a multiplicity of service available.
When it went before a Division composed of three
of the eleven Commissioners, we petitioned to reopen, to present
proof of the changed conditions.
that will not be necessary.

The Commission said, "No,

Under our decision, citing

primarily the West Brothers case, we will give effect to this
increase in service.”
Incidentally, the West Brothers^ case is particularly
unique because it involved two of the points involved and the
carriers involved.

Briefly stated, the Commission had granted

West authority to operate from Alabama to Louisiana, which
included authority to operate from Birmingham to Baton Rouge.
After that grant had been approved, certain protestants
petitioned the Commission foe reconsideration, as we did in
this case, pointing out that in another case, while the West

43

Brothers case was pending, in the Mercury case the Commission
had granted Mercury authority to operate between Birmingham
and Baton Rouge.

The Commission said,, "That’s right, we must

give effect to our grants in other proceedings.

We reopened

the West Brothers case, we modified that so as to eliminate
from that grant to West Brothers the authority to operate
between Birmingham and Baton Rouge.

We have given Mercury” —

now, Mercury wasn’t even a party to the West Brothers case,
but they properly gave effect to their other decisions.

In

other words, letting the right hand know what the left hand
was doing.
In our case they cited West Brothers as authority
for the proposition we must give effect, but what did they
do?

They granted two more carriers — Red Ball and Bowman —

authority from Birmingham to Baton Rouge, that they had just
said in West we can't do, and three more from Atlanta to
Baton Rouge, all three of these- applicants.
So at the time of the Commission decision they
went back and looked at an exhibit that had been introduced
by Johnson at the outset of the hearing summarizing all of
the available single-line service and they said, based on that
exhibit, we conclude there is a paucity of single-line service
available.

And in that respect we take note of the fact that

in 1970 Census compared to '60 Census, there had been an
increase in population.

44
So they judged — and the only comprehensive analysis
they made of the quantity of service available was based upon
the condition in early 1966 —* they concluded there is a
paucity of single-line service available, ignoring the
Examiners1 conclusion that giving effect to the changes there
is now a multiplicity of service.
But what had taken place?

Two more years had

transpired between the Examiners" decision and the Division
decision.

And by then the seven between Atlanta and Dallas

had grown to 13.

At the time of the hearing there was one

single-line carrier between Baton Rouge and Atlanta.

At the

time of the Division's decision? there were seven.
So the witnesses had been saying, "We would like to
have another carrier available."

without exception they all

had multiple other carriers available.

The Commission in

certain respects said this case is moot as to certain aspects
of it that are not important here.

We submit they could just

as well have said the entire case was moot because the issue
is a contention there is a need for additional single-line
service and there has been a massive inflow of single-line
service occurred while these cases are pending.
Instead of doing that, saying we must give effect,
to these recent grants, they did not give effect to the recent
grants.

Instead they continued on what the court termed a

prejudicial and discriminatory double standard.

45
I would like to illustrate that a little bit
further.

I have mentioned these

transit time studies.

They

were the most .important part of our evidence, that's true.
But they did other things.

What about the transit time studies

that the shippers themselves introduced?

They were fragmentary,

individual shippers showing different things.

So after the

applicants had all rested, there was a several-month recess.
We took every single transit time study presented by every
witness and made it into a composite analysis where you could
look at it together and not fragmentary.

What did it show?

It showed that the protestant’s service reflected by those
exhibits between the points that we studied were superior to
the applicants' service.

But more significant is that overall

the service was reasonably satisfactory e’/en bearing in mind
that the shippers set about, in most instances, to give the
horrible examples of poor service.
The Commission would not give effect to our analysis,
the composite analysis, but looked only to the fragmentary
exhibits as they were introduced.

The Commission said this;

"Certain protestants have restrictions in their tariffs and
engage in certain restrictive practices."
Well, in the first place, we don't think that's in
point.

The Commission has plenary power to require a carrier

to do away with any restrictive practice or eliminate from
its tariff any restrictive provision.

We heard argument to

46

that effect this morning in connection with a different
section of the act.

But what did they do?

They said, "One of

the reasons we want to grant this is because the protestants
have restrictions, ignoring the fact that the applicants had
the identical restrictions

and while the case was pending,

published additional ones.

We pointed that out; they paid no

attention whatever to that, but just hung their findings on
the fact that the protestants had certain restrictions.

They

went out of the recox’d and out of their way, if it may please
the Court, to take official notice of an industry publication
that said that one of the protestants had closed one terminal
subsequent to the hearing in one town in Mississippi.

We had

been arguing that the applicants' proposals were not realistic
but also, among other things, there was Bowman proposing to
establish a whole series of new terminals, whereas it served
vast areas in the East where it had no terminals at all, over
a hundred cities of comparable size where it had no terminals.
We were pressing that point.

They ignored that argument, but

went outside of the record to take official notice of the fact
that one protestant had closed a terminal in one point.
When they did that, we petitioned them, "But look
here, the same publication will show that Red Ball, one of
the applicants, had closed 35 of its terminals."

But the

Commission said one of the reasons we are going to grant
authority to Red Ball is because it has 92 terminals.

That

47
fact was not correct.

It was correct at the time of the hear-

ing, but it was not correct at the time it appeared in the
Commission’s report.

lie pointed that out, they had closed 35
The appellants did cite that in their

reply brief to this Court filed a few days ago justifying the
Commission’s grant, the finding that there were 92 terminals,
pointing out that, really the closing of the terminals of Red
Ball was not reflected in the same edition of that American
Motor Carrier Directory, but in another edition.

They could

have pointed it out to the Commission if they had seen fit to
do so, this is a changed condition, wa bring it to your
attention.
Again, one standard was applied to the applicants?
a different standard was applied to the protestants.

by the Examiners, those criticisms applied to the applicants
as well as to the protestants.

They did not give effect to

any of those.
So w& filed a petition.

It was overruled by a two-

to-one vote of the Commission, without an opinion.

We asked

for the entire Commission to review it? again without an
opinion it was denied.

We it went to court on the basis of

two of the Coramissloners finally voting to grant, and we submit
under conditions that violated the basic rules of fairness.
Nov;, we submit, may it please the Court, that the

48

proper standard cf review is found in examining' section 706
of the Administrative Procedure Act in its entirety.

It's

not necessary to decide whether the arbitrary or capricious
standard is more strict as alleged than the substantial evidence
test.

Some text writer will say just the opposite.

That is

not involved in this proceeding, not necessary for this Court
to make that decision.

It's also not necessary for any court

to compartmentalize its findings that this is a subsection (a)
decision or a subsection (b) decision.

I mate reference to the Atchison case in which there
was a recital by the lower court and by one of the opinions -there wasn’t a majority opinion here — that there was
substantial evidence.

But the court went on to set it aside

or finding the setting aside by the lower court, not the lack
of substantial evidence or not for any of the other grounds
without specifying exactly what it was, but obviously it was
because it was arbitrary, capricious, or abuse of discretion
or not otherwise in accordance with law.
The applicants state title and again, "Look at this
evidence.

By themselves these facts provj.de the substantial

evidence for the Commission's findings of inadequate service."
But. as stated in Universal Camara by Mr. Justice Frankfurt, •
the Administrative Procedure Act put that to a rest.
cannot look at evidence by itself.
evidence.

You

You must look at the entire

49
The court quoted from Professor Jaffe an excellent
statement on this point:

To abstract out of a case that part

of the evidence which can be made to support a conclusion is
to imagine an abstract case, a case that was never tried.
A conclusion based on such abstracted evidence may be"rational"
but it is not a rational decision of the case which was in
fact tried.

Evidence which may be logically substantial in

isolation may lose its logical relevance,even, its claim to
credibility, in context with other evidence.
We say that the Division, the three-man Division,
should have given effect to the entire evidence instead of
saying, "We will not give effect to this evidence? we will
give effect to the identical evidence if it helps the applicants?
We won’t give effect to it if it’s detrimental to the applicants,
and assigning a reason,that is to say, like the evidence
relates to specific shippers which was equally applicable to
all of the evidence that they did give effect to.
All in the world the dourfc here was talking about is
fairness.

The Division did not treat these parties with

fairness, and as a result the public would be damaged under
this decision.

Instead of saying, "We are going to grant

three more carriers from Atlanta to Dallas" ~~ as I really
believe the Division thought that they were doing.
would be doing was increasing the 16 to 19.

What they

Instead of

putting an additional carrier in operation from Atlanta to

50

Baton Rouge * they would increase the 7 to 10.

Nowhere in there

did they recognize what the present service was, although they
said, "We must give effect to it."
Now, the lower court entered an order setting aside,
holding invalid, and. enjoining the implementation of the
Coramission's order in the statutory language.
as the lower court went.

That's as far

The Government, but not the private

parties, then filed a motion saying, "That order is beyond your
power, your jurisdiction.
it to provide for remand."

You must supplement it or amend
The court says, "No, remand isn't

by statute or case law obligatory.

It is discretionary."

No

one has ever suggested that remand would serve a useful
purpose, and here, 1 believe, it’s been admitted that remand
will not serve a useful purpose to the Commission.
. Ir1"

This record is old.
because

itwas old.

The court didn't set it aside

But if it went back to the Commission

with instructions to give effect to this record, this record
deals with that Baton Rouge shipper talking about, "I need a
second single-line carrier," whereas in fact today there are
seven.

Itdeals with apples? the issues is oranges.

There is

no need

in the world to use that. And as the court said, it

would impede rather than facilitate further proceedings that
the Commission is free at any time to conduct.

We do not go

into the field of ultimate decision or the issue of public
convenience and necessity.

51
QUESTION:

Could I as): you, would the district

court have remanded had it thought the record was not stale,
but was current?
MR. STEVENS:

Your Honor, that is pure speculation

because .
QUESTIONs

Well, then, I will ask it the other way:

Why didn't he remand?
MR. STEVENS:

In the first place, the only suggestion

to remand had to do with jurisdiction.

That was all that

was suggested, "You do not have jurisdiction to enter your
order."

It was never suggested that you ought to remand,

that it would be helpful to remand, only that you must remand.
QUESTION:

What reason did the district court give,

though, in response to the motion to amend the judgment?
MR. STEVENS:
to enter the judgment.

First it says that we have the power
That disposed of the technical

question raised by the motion.
Then they went further in a very detailed opinion
and gave the reasons why the court thought that a remand
would impede rather than facilitate
QUESTION:

One

of

the reasons was that they

thought the record v/as very stale.
MR. STEVENS:

That was one of the reasons, yes.

But, your Honor, I might suggest this;

It wasn’t simply

because it was old; it was because the conditions after the

52
close of -the record had changed to such an extent.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

Do you suppose that

the district court, in view of the reason it gave in denying
that motion, saying that whether there was substantial evidence
or not at one time, the record is just so old and irrelevant
to the current situation that the order can’t stand?
MR. STEVENS:

No, I do not think that they were

saying that the order cannot stand.

That decision had nothing

to do with the age of the record, as I read the court’s
opinion, sir.

It reached its decision without any reference

at all to the age of the record.

It considered the age of the

record only as to where should we go from here?
QUESTION:

Yes.

Well, when it finally said "dismiss

and enjoin permanently the issuance of these certificates,"
it must have had a reason for doing it.
MR. STEVENS:

The reason it assigned is because the

order was arbitrary and capricious, not because of the age
of the record.

The-, age of the record question came after that

order was entered, and we permanently enjoin the enforcement
of this particular order, that is, implementing the order that
v;as before the court.
Then it addressed itself to the question, Should we
amend that order and make it obligatory that the Commission
have further proceedings on the present record or shall we just
leave it up to the Commission as to what they are going to do.

53
And it said f "We think that the Comities ion would he better off
starting over, citing the cases that it cited there, which the
Commission has been free to do at any time.5*
But no one has yet suggested that it would be
helpful in the further proceedings to test the issue of
present and future public convenience and necessity.
the present situation must be considered.

Obviously

No one has suggested

that in making that determination, use of the old record would
facilitate the determination of Idle issue.
We submit that basically here the court, as stated
in the J. T. Transport case, that it recited, "We must give
deference to the Commission.

The issue of public convenience

and necessity is for the Commission, but we do not. have to
accept the Commission’s determination where we are convinced,
as here, the Commission has loaded one of the scales."

That

statement fully applies to this.
Also, the statement in Burlington Truck Lines
cited by the court that expert discretion is the life blood
of administrative process.

But unless we make the requirements

for administrative action stricc and demanding expertise,
the strength of modern government can become a monster which
rules with no practical limits on its discretion.
Thank you.

Mr. Rhyne and Mr. Patton, as

I am advised, the two of you have 15 minutes.

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES S. RHYNE
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. RHYNE:
it please the Courts

Thank you, Mr. Justice Douglas, and may
Frankly, in view of the concession by

counsel that the findings of fact of the Interstate Commerce
Commission were not in issue here or in the court below or in
the complaint, I really see no useful purpose that I could
perform by rearguing the evidence to this Court.
So everything that my distinguished adversary said,
he argued over and over again to the Commission, everything
has been updated several times.

So unless some member of the

Court ha3 questions that they would like me to answer, I
don't see what useful purpose I could perform by talking about
findings that are not in issue.
as I*m concerned.

It’s over.

That’s the whole case as far
And I would simply urge that

under the circumstances the Court send it back to the
district court with instructions to dismiss.

I don't see how

there is any other alternative.
QUESTION:
Commission,

Mr. Rhyne, how about, for example, the

its order was partly based on the fact that

Red Ball had 94 terminals and now we are told it has closed 35
of those.

The Commission doesn’t mention that; you don't

mention it; in fact, you talk about 94.
MR. RHYNE:

In our reply brief we point out that

the Commission at the time of its decision based its official

55
notice on one document that was a 1971 document, and whafc they
are talking about on the closing is a 1972 document.
But, Mr. Justice Stewart, what they are really
talking about is agency discontinuances and consolidations
done by Red Ball.

That isn't a major thing in this case at

all.
QUESTION?

Yet they went out of their way to, as I

understand it, to point out that one of the protestants
closed

a

had

single terminal, one terminal.
MR. RHYNE;

they were talkir.

Well, again, they did that, yes, but

about they took official notice of this,

they took official notice of that.

So they took official

notice of the facts as they were at the time of their

I really don’t think that is a major part of their

decision.

decision, because as I said before the Commission regrouped
the testimony of tire witnesses, these 933 witnesses,according
to geographic points, which mads the service stand out that
was needed.

That was the big issue here.

And after that

was done, they take a look at points that needed service and
that's how they selected the three carriers.
into that picture.
QUESTION;

They just fitted

They could best serve those points.
Well.at the time of the hearing 1 think

there was one direct line from Atlanta to Baton Rouge and
the Commission's order is based on that.
out there are seven, aren't there?

And now it turns

56
MR. RHYNE:
not based on one line»

Your Honor, the Commission' s order is
If your Honor will look at Exhibit G,

every increase in service is listed there, and if your Honor
will look at Exhibit D, every increase in service is mentioned
there.

And the Ccxnmission said, "Sure, all of these arguments

about increased are argued all the way through,51 and they
say in spite of all this, 5,We find that the public interest
requires this new service."

So I think that since the

Coramission, the great expert in this whole area, has held
that additional service, and particularly breakthrough service
through the gateway, sure there was one or two before this
started went through the gateway and there was probably one
or two more that had increased.

But getting through those

gateways was an enormous breakthrough for the shippers that
are involved here.
1 don't really want to reargue my evidence, but I

think, Mr. Justice Stewart, that every point that was raised
here the Commission considered.
consider it.

It did.

And it was the one to

They don't challenge their findings.

I really don't know what else I could say.
So, thank you very much.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS;

The case is submitted.

(Whereupon, at Is30 p.m., the oral argument in the
above-entitled matter was concluded.)
