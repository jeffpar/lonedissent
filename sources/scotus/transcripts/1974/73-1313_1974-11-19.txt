ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW E. MURRAY
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. MURRAY;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

tais. Honorable Court:

I have agreed to divide my time with

Mr. Corae of the National Labor Relations Board because I
felt that the Court would like to hear from the agency itself
as to how it has been interpreting the question which is
before us today.

And that is the applicability cf sections

554 and the following sections to the 10(k) hearing process
in the Labor-Management Relations Act„
The facts of this case commenced in Elk Grove
Village, a little town at the edge of Cook County which includes
the greater Chicago area, and the municipality in Elk Grove
had given ITT a contract to install all its communication
equipment in tire new Municipal Building.
Local 134 of trie IBEW had been doing practically
all installation of telephone equipment in Cook County for
many years and considered this particular area its private
preserve.

So a strike took place.

IBEW was out there pulling

4
cable and they found out that the ITT employees who were
represented by a nationwide agreement by the Communication
Workers of America, were going to do the installation, and
they struck the job.
We filed an 8(b)(4)(D) charge, ana after the usual
10-day period in which the Board tries to get the parties to
settle the dispute, the matter, the complaint issued, and the
hearing officer was appointed, the facts were gathered,
everyone introduced their evidence, including the employers
and the unions, and the 10 (k) v/as adjudged by the court, was
adjudged proper that the Communication Workers employed by
ITT be given this work.
The other party at that point has 10 days to tell
the Regional Director if they are going to abide by this
decision.

The 10-day period elapsed, and they informed the

Regional Director that they did not intend to abide by tiie
ruling of the Board in the 10 (k) proceeding, wnicii, of course,
gave rise to the immediate filing of an 3(b)(4)(D) charge
under section 10(b) and 10(c) of the Act.
The 10(b) charge, of course, is a prosecutorial
proceeding by the Board, as opposed to a purely investigative
proceeding under 10(k), and therefore the Board needs the
general counsel, must have a prosecutor, and the hearing
officer in the 10(k) proceeding whose duties it was merely
to gather evidence and submit the record to the Board without

recommendation was appointed as prosecutor in the 10 (b) and
(c) unfair labor practice case.
Mow, there was no objection made to this until the
proceedings were concluded, and at that point IBMW in its
brief complained that the same man who had sat in the 10(k)
proceeding and heard the evidence was comingling prosecutorial witn
judicial functions in violation of the Administrative
Procedure Act.
Mow, the court both in — the Board,of course,
overruled this contention.

It went up to the Seventh Circuit.

They found that indeed IBEW was guilty of 0(b)(4)(D), without
question, that this is precisely what the section had been
enacted to prevent.

But they finally said that they would

not enforce the order because they felt that 10(k) was
suoject to 554, et cetera, the Administrative Procedure Act,
and there was an illegal coraingling of judicial and investiga­
tive functions — I mean prosecutorial and investigative
functions, which that Act forbids.
Nov/, of course, Iir. Come, I think, will concentrate
generally on how the Board has treated 10(k) with reference
to the Administrative Procedure Act over a long period of
time.

We are all familiar with the fact that the Board lias

always treated 10(k) as not subject to the Administrative
Procedure Act, and in a series of cases it so held that this
was never challenged by Congress or the courts for a period

G
of 25 years.
We know also that the Board has -~
QUESTION:

Mr. Murray, then you don't agree with

Judge Hurrah's observation in his opinion, and I quote;

is apparently admitted that section 554 appli.es to 10 (k)

There is absolutely no basis in the record

So tiiis is

Judge Hurrah did not cite any authority

or make any reference to the record in support of tnis
observation simply because it was not there.
Now, in making this unwarranted observation and
assumption, in addition to ignoring everything that the National
Labor Relations Board has done in this matter, the U.S. Courts
of Appeal have had occasion to examine this.

The most recent

decision — we11, second most recent decision, vms the
D.C. Circuit in Bricklayers, and in that case Judge Fahey
flatly holds that 10 (k) proceedings are not applicable to blue
Administrative Procedure Act, and in that case the issue was
whether trial examiners should be used instead of hearing
officers.

And there is quite a distinction between a hearing

officer and a trial examiner.

Judge Hurrah sees fit to use

the word interchangeably, but they are quite different types of

from making any recommendation.

His sole function is

and sent the record to the Board.
ue did make evidentiary rulings.

That was his sole function,
But there is nothing in the

record to indicate that there are any improper evidentiary
rulings, either in the Board decision or the Seventh Circuit
decision.
So that particular thing, the prejudice is not
apparent; if there was any, it certainly is not apparent in
the record in any way, shape, or form.
Nov/, there was also a very recent case doi/n in the
Fifth Circuit, Shell Chemical, which is cited in the Board's
brief, which was actually decided after our brief was filed
which supports Bricklayers in every respect in this particular
question.

And, of course, this Court has had an opportunity

to examine and to discuss this proolera,

Mr. Justice VJnite,

in the Plasterers case,discussed the nature.’ of 10 (k), and he
emphasized the fact that no one is bound by a 10(k) decision,

o

not either of the

unions nor the employers.

Of course, the

judge did say further that the 10(k) determination of the
Board, wnich requires, incidentally, a different modicum of
proof than tne regular unfair labor practice case, that it
nevertheless had a very strong effect on the 10(b) and (c)
case which followed on the 8(b)(4).
QUESTION:

has it ever happened that a 10(k) winner

loses in the unfair labor practice?
MR. MURRAY:

Wot to mv knowledge, your honor.

But I

think perhaps Mr. Come would have more information on that
subject than do I.
But the most important area here is the practical
results that would ensue if the 10(k) determination were to be
held to be an adjudication under section 554.

This would

require, indeed, that you have administrative law judges rather
tnan hearing officers.

We would have to await the appointment

of an administrative law judge.
Wow, we must not forget that the passage of 10(k)
by Congress was to expedite the settling of jurisdictional
disputes.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there at

1 o'clock.
(Whereupon, at. 12 neon, a recess was taken until
1 p.m. the same day.)

9
AFTERNOON SESSI OH

(1:01 p.m.)
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Hr. Murray, you may

continue.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW E. MURRAY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MURRAY:

(Continued)

As I was saying at the recess, there

was a unanimous opinion, practically, in the country for the
need for legislation to quickly settle jurisdictional strikes.
Congress was very much in the mood, and it certainly was their
intent, the unions wanted it, the employers wanted it, and
even President Truman sent a special message regarding this
legislation.
But, unfortunately, it hasn't worked out. as well as
it was hoped.

However, if this decision is allowed to stand

we might suggest that it has been in litigation for four years
at this point, and the jurisdictional dispute is still not
settled.
The Board has furnished us with statistics showing
that even if you had an 8(b)(2) and (3) case with a trial
examiner, which would be required under the Administrative
Procedure Act, that the average time elapsed before the final
Board order is 374 days.

So obviously, this is going to

completely thwart the congressional intent if this decision is
allowed to stand.

The statute will have to be amended, something

will have to be done.

But the fact is, as many of these

8(b)(2)'s and 8(b)(3)'s that I have participated in, I have
never seen one ended inside of two years, including the appeal
to the Circuit Court.

You have submitted findings of fact

and conclusions of law, briefs, exceptions, briefs, motion for
reconsideration, more briefs, lots of time to appeal to the
appellate court, more briefs, and oral arguments, and motions
for rehearing with more briefs, and it is simply not, it
cannot be, an expeditious way of settling this very real
problem which causes so much havoc in

industry.

wording of the statute does not justify it.

And the

We are warned

in the early stages of the Act that the definitions are not to
be taken too seriously as defining the scope of the Act, that
there may be a number of exceptions.

Also, in 534 proper,

we have the exception that does not apply to certification of
worker representatives, which really, in the last analysis,
is what 10(k) amounts to.

In the case of a 9(c) proceeding,

they are certifying workers for a particular plant or a
particular unit.

In a 10(k) proceeding they are certifying

workers for a particular type of work.

And by and large it's

the same thing, both proceedings conducted by hearing officers
without recommendation to the Board, merely vehicles to elicit
evidence and transport the record to the Board.
We therefore submit that this unwarranted assumption,
completely unwarranted assumption, of Judge Murrah that the

Act is applicable, should be disregarded because there is
nothing in the Act, there is nothing in the record to justify
it.
Now, furthermore, and lastly, no prejudice could ha\Te
resulted here, as for instance in the case of Wong Yang Sung,
I don’t recall the exact wording of that case, where you have
a prosecutor building a case and then sitting in judgment on it.
Here this hearing officer could not possibly know, again
contrary to one of Judge Hurrah's assumptions, he could not
knov; to whom the work would be awarded by the Board or whether
there in fact would be a 10(b)(4) or a 10(b)(4)(D) file.

He

couldn1t know that, he had no way of knowing that he would
be the prosecutor, and there is just nothing to justify any
exception to the procedures that were taken in this particular
case.
Thank you very much for your patience, your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Murray.

Mr. Come.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORTON J, COME ON BEHALF
OF RESPONDENT NLRB, SUPPORTING PETITIONER
MR. COME:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

As Mr. Murray has indicated, a 10(k) hearing, which

this Court had occasion to become familiar with in the
Plasterers case three years ago, is not an adversary or
accusatory proceeding , like an unfair labor practice proceeding.

12
Its purpose is not to determine whether an unfair labor
practice has been committed, but rather to obviate the need for
such a determination by resolving the underlying jurisdictional
dispute»
It is

held, like a representation case hearing, not

before an administrative law judge, but a hearing officer who
is an employee of the Regional Office»

And the hearing officer's

function is solely to develop a full record so that the Board
may determine which of two competing groxaps is entitled to
claim the work in dispute»
The evidentiary material relates primarily to such
matters as the employee skills, area employer and industry
practice, collective bargaining agreements — in short, the
type of economic material or administrative material which
rarely presents credibility issues»

And it is for that reason

that the hearing officer doesn't make any credibility determina­
tions »
At the close of the hearing, the case is transmitted
to the Board for a decision, the hearing officer prepares an
analysis of the issues, but does not, as I say, make any
credibility determinations,he makes no recommendations, just
as in the representation procedure.
The Board makes its determination on the basis of
the record developed by the hearing officer, his analysis of
the record which contains no recommendation»

13
QUESTION;

Is there oral argument on that?

MR. COME:

There can be oral argument before the

Board if the Board chooses to grant it.
Now, if the parties comply with the Board's 10(k)
determination, the 8(b)(4)(D) charge is dismissed* you never
get an unfair labor practice proceeding.
QUESTION:

Dees that occur in most of the cases?

Or do you know?
MR. COME:
of the cases.

Compliance happens in a fair percentage

I wouldn't say that it's most.

It’s not

insignificant.
QUESTION:

Is there any average time between the

hearing and the completion of the Board proceeding?
MR. COME:

Well, I think that the statistics that

we have given indicate that the time.between notice of hearing
and Board determination in a 10(k) proceeding is about 175
days.
QUESTION:

Let's assume there was compliance in

only one out of 100,000 cases or a thousand.
there is hardly ever they complied.

Let's assume

Bo you always have to

go through the unfair labor practice proceeding anyway.
Wouldn't that make some difference to you as to what should
happen in this case?
MR. COME:

No, it would not make any difference.

QUESTION:

Because certainly you must ~ no one

14
hardly ever upsets a 10 (3c) proceeding , is successful in upsetting
one, is it?
MR- COME:

Well, this goes to the question that

Justice Blackman asked earlier-

When the 8(b)(4)(D) proceeding

eventuates, if one does eventuate, the issues that are open,
just as in the "R" case, the 10(k) determination is not subject
to relitigation, absent newly discovered evidence.

So that

as a practical matter, the only issue that is open is whether
or not the union that is bringing stike pressure and lost in
the 10(k)

is picketing for the object that 8(b)(4)(D) proscribes.

Only a probable cause determination is made at the 10(k)
stage-

You have the typical unfair labor practice standard of

a preponderance of the evidence that has to be sustained in
the 8(b)(4)(D).

If the union is able to show that in fact

it does not have the 8(b)(4)(D) object —
QUESTION;

Wait a minute.

When you say the probable

standard at 10(k) proceeding, at the conclusion of the 10(k)
proceeding there is a decision?
MR. CO?»®:

There is a decision,

QUESTION;

And it doesn't say there is probable cause

to believe that this union or that union gets the work.
MR. COME:

There is a probable cause standard only

on whether or not the union engaged in the kind of strike
pressure for the object which you need to trigger the 10 (k)
determination.

15
QUESTION:

I agree with you, we need a probable

cause standard as to whether to start a 10(h) proceeding.
MRo COME:

You are quite right that in

terras

of the determination of who is entitled to the work* that is
not put in —
QUESTION;
isn’t it?

No, it isn’t, and it's preponderance,

Mien the Board sits down to decide x-rtiich one is

entitled in the 10(k) proceeding, it's preponderance.
MR. COME:

That is correct.

The Board does that on

the basis of its own analysis of the record and not on the
basis of any recommendation by the hearing officer.

But it’s

exactly the same as it is with the representation case.
Now, if the Board should issue an 8(b)(4)(D) order,
the losing union can take that to the Court of Appeals and
get reviex* of not only the 8(b) (4) (D) order but also of the
10(k) determination and he may be able to get the 10(k)
determination set aside by the Court of Appeals.

That just

happened in the Ninth Circuit.
QUESTION:

It would be the same reviewing standard,

is there substantial evidence to support the conclusion.
MR. COME:

I believe that that is so.

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. COME:

But the problem is whether or not we have

an adjudication within the meaning of the APA.

And the problem

that arises is that — and I am referring the Court to section

16

554 of the Administrative Procedure Act, which is at page 41 of
the Board’s brief, the gray one here.

It says, "This section

applies, according to the provisions thereof, in every case of
adjudication required by statute to be determined on the record
after opportunity for an agency hearing."

And then you have

a list of six exceptions, the sixth being the certification of
worker representatives.
Now, we submit that the 10(k) determination is not
an adjudication within the meaning of 554, and if it isn't
within 554, then everything else follows —* the remaining
provisions of the APA are not applicable.

We submit that

it’s not within 554 for at least three reasons %
In the first place, it is not an adjudication because
an adjudication is defined as agency process for the formulation
of an order, and order means the whole or part of a final
disposition of ah agency in a matter other than rule-making.
We submit that a 10(k) determination is not a final disposition
of the matter which invoked the Board’s processes. A matter
that invoked the Board's processes was the 8(b)(4)(D) charge.
That is not resolved by the 10(k) proceeding.

You may never

get an 8(b)(4)(D) proceeding. At least you don't know that
at the time that the 10(k) determination is made.
Secondly, we submit that even if it were an
adjudication within the meaning of the APA, it is not an
adjudication required by statute to be determined on the record

17
after opportunity for an agency hearing. Although the statute
does require,if the Board is to make the determination, that
it shall have a hearing, it does not go on and specify the
nature of that hearing.

And under this Court's decision in

the Florida Railway case and Allegheny-Ludlum, which was cited
in our brief, the Court has made plain that Congress was using
the term "to determine on the record., after opportunity for
hearing," specifically for the purpose of screening out those
situations where there was a hearing requirement, but not a
formal hearing requirement.

And I might say that the word

"hearing" is only an alternative if the parties are unable by
some private means of adjustment to work out the jurisdictional
dispute, and certainly that doesn't have to be a record type
hearing.
And thirdly, we say, that if we fail on those two
counts, we believe that it is possible to read the 10(k)
proceeding as falling within the "%» case exception (6)
certification of worker representatives.
QUESTION;

That is a terra of "R", though, isn't it?

MR. COME:

That is a term of "R"however, it

occurred to me on looking over the statute the other evening, and
I know arguments thought of on the eve of an argument are
such that -- an 8(b)(4)(D) on page 31 of our brief, there is
an "unless” clause in there that proscribes forcing or
requiring an assignment of work and so on, "unless such

18

employer is failing to conform to an order or certification of
the .Board determining the bargaining representative for
employees performing such work.And the Board has interpreted
that and tills Court notes that in a footnote in Plasterers as
permitting it to dismiss the 8(b)(4)(D) charge where it runs
in favor of the striking union and the employer has not complied
with it.

So I think that this "unless" clause gives some

support to what I would conceive would o the .wise be a
QUESTIONS

You wouldn't rely only on that, would you?

MR. COME:

No, I would not, your Honor.

I think

that our best argument is the prior two that I have made.
And I might just say before I sit down that this has
been a contemporaneous interpretation of the Board that
was enunciated shortly after 10(k) was added to the Act in
1949 and it has consistently been repeated by the Board.

Sc

we do not have a case here of the Board changing its position.
Thank you, your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Fitzgerald.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT E. FITZGERALD, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FITZGERALD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts Before I begin the prepared part of my
argument, I must point out that we do disagree with Mr. Come
that the 10(k) hearing is the same as the representation case
hearing, and I should initially note that these two types of

13
hearings are differentiated by the fact that one is provided
for in section 9 of the Labor Management Relations Act
handling representation matters, and the 10(k) proceeding is
provided for in section 10 of the statute, having to do with
unfair labor practice matters primarily.
I think Mr. Come has correctly rioted that the
primary issue before the Court, based upon the Seventh Circuit
Court of Appeals decision which states very clearly that the
Administrative Procedure Act, particularly section 554, does
apply to the Labor Board's 10(k) hearings» ho

has noted

correctly that the basic question is whether the Board's 10(k)
hearing is an adjudication within the meaning of the
Administrative Procedure Act.
I think necessarily we must then look at and
analyze the two statutes themselves as well as the related
sections of both of those statutes.
QUESTION;

I gather you don't support the Court of

Appeals statement that it is apparently admitted that 554
applies to 10(k) hearings.
MR. FITZGERALDs
QUESTION;

I am sorry. Judge, your —•

The Court of Appeals stated, as Justice

Blackmun pointed out earlier, it is apparently admitted that
554 applies to 10(k) hearings.
MR. FITZGERALD:
admits that --

It is not admitted?

I don't believe the Labor Board

20
QUESTION;

Whoever did in this case?

MR. FITZGERALD:

Well, that was our basic contention,

and —
QUESTION:

No, that’s your contention.

This says

it’s admitted.
MR. FITZGERALDS

I think the Court, as I read its

decisions, said that it assumed that the Board would follow
the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act based
primarily upon the rationale of the -QUESTION:

That's not my question.

Who admitted it?

The word is, "It is admitted."
MR. FITZGERALD:
on the record, your Honor.

I don’t believe it was ever admitted
You are correct in that.

But I think that the basic question of whether 554
does in reality apply to the 10(k) hearings, particularly in
light of this Court’s decision in the Plasterers case, must
ba viewed in light of what the purpose of the Administrative
Procedure Act was designed to do.

And as the Court of Appeals

noted and as was explained very fully in the Wong case, the
whole purpose of the Administrative Procedure Act was to
set

down the outer limits within which the administrative

agencies could operate and particularly to prevent the
comingling of functions, particularly the prosecutorial
function with the adjudicative function.

And in so setting

out in the Administrative Procedure Act, section 554 was

21
specifically designed and in its subsection (d) in the second
paragraph, specifically prevented comingling of these functions.
Now, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals found that
there was no exception to be granted to the Labor Board in its
10(k) hearings from the application of section 554 of the
Administrative Procedure Act.

And there I might note that in

the Labor-Management Relations Act Congress has stated that
the Labor Board, in the performance of its functions under the
Labor-Management Relations Act, must provide and follow rules
in conformity with the Administrative Procedure Act.

.And

that may be the source of the Seventh Circuit and Judge
Hurrah's comment about it is conceded that 554 applies.
But in any event, I think if we look at section 551
as well as section 554, the Court of Appeals decision that
the 10(k) hearing is an adjudication within the meaning of
section 554 is a valid conclusion, and further, that no
exception lies, particularly because the 10(k) hearing is not
the same as a representation case.
I think that the language of 551 of the Administrative
Procedure Act has been passed upon numerous tiroes by this
Court.

We cited the Wyman-Gordon case in which this Court

said, through Mr. Justice Black, that a representation case
meats the criteria of section 551 of the Administrative
Procedure Act.

This rationale has been affirmed by this Court

as late as Mr. Justice Powell's decision in the Bell Aerospace

22

case, as I believe referred to also in other decisions, including
Florida East Coast.
So that it’s clear that the Labor Board proceedings
are within the ambit of the Administrative Procedure Act as
adjudications, particularly under section 551.
Then the critical question becomes:

Is there anything

in section 554 that would take the Labor Board proceedings,
particularly the 10(k) proceedings, out from under the applica­
tion of section 554?

And I submit that the Court of Appeals

clearly found, and correctly found, that the 10(k) proceedings
is up to the agency review which becomes the final part of the
Board order, as Mr. Justice White clearly analysed in the
Plasterers case.

The 10(k) proceeding is an integral part of

the procedure which the Board has provided v/ithin the ambit of
section 10 of the statute.

In other words, section 10 of the

statute provides that the Labor Board can pursue the unfair
labor practice matters and under section 10(k) specifically can
'hear and should hear and determine unfair labor practice
matters in the jurisdictional dispute area and should decide
and award the work in question to one of the two competing
unions.

This rationale of the Plasterers case, of course,

picked up and adopted the CB5 decision in which the Board
was admonished to make a determination in jurisdictional
dispute matters and, under section 10(k), to award the work
to one of the competing unions.

23

But I think that when we look at the Plasterers
decision, we have to see if there is anything in there, in
that decision,which would make the 10(k) proceedings other
than an integral part of the unfair labor practice under
section 8(b)(4)(D).

The Court of Appeals, Mr, Justice Murrah,

found that this was an integral part of the Board’s final
order, which is the unfair labor practice decision in the
8(b) (4) (D) case,
I subruit that that is a correct statement of the law7
and that the Plasterers analysis of the Labor Board procedure
fully warrants the application of the principle that the
Administrative Procedure Act, section 554, must apply,
Nov;, the Board, as X said earlier, takes the
position that the representation case is the same as the
10(k) hearing.

We submit that this is not the same proceedings

because the object of the tvro hearings is entirely different.
In the representation case, section 9 of the statute gives
the Board

authority to conduct elections, and in the course

of that authority to conduct elections, has the right to
hold hearings in which to determine the correct and appropriate
bargaining unit which should be the subject of the election.
However, in section 10(k) of the instrument and
section 10 of the Labor-Mar-agement Relations Act, an entirely
different problem is approached, that of unfair labor
practices.

An integral part of section 10 is the 10(k)

24
proceeding by which Congress said to the Labor Board,

You

must hear and determine the jurisdictional dispute which
underlies the unfair labor practice proceeding.

So that

\'7hen the Board decides the 10 (k) aspect, the jurisdictional
question, that decision is—-of course, it is termed a decision
and determination of dispute - ®<*that decision is then picked up
a.v i absorbed into the subsequent unfair labor practice proceeding
should

there be an unfair labor practice proceeding, on

the 8(b)(4)(D) question.

So that within the definition

section of the Administrative Procedure Act, section 551,
clearly the 10(k) proceeding is a part of the final order which
the Board does come down with in the unfair labor practice
matter.
So in other words, we have an absorption of the
10(k) decision into the unfair labor practice decision and
under the Board's own rules, we find that the 10(k) matter is
an integral part of the final order of the unfair labor
practice matter.
So we submit that the Court of Appeals was correct
when it found that section 554 does apply to 10(k) hearings
because the 10(k) hearing is a part of the agency process
leading to its final order.
The arguments presented primarily in the briefs by
the Labor Board and ITT is that the detrimental effects will
flow from affirming the decision of the Seventh Circuit Court

25
of Appeals.

We submit that these arguments as to detrimental

effect are not valid.
The first and basic argument is that thesre will be
a necessity for judicial review of section 10(k) determinations
if the Seventh Circuit opinion is affirmed.

In other words,

if the 10(k) decision is found to be an adjudication under
the Administrative Procedure Act, necessarily judicial review
must follow.
We submit that this conclusion is not warranted
and that the Seventh Circuit recognized clearly that the
10(k) proceeding is only the first step leading to the final
order of the Labor Board which is the ultimate unfair labor
practice determination.

So that the Board's own rules and

regulations prescribe what is a final and therefore reviewable
order under the provisions of the Labor-Management Relations
Act.

In other words, section 10(e) and 10(f) gave to the

Labor Board — excuse me, under section 10(f) gave to a party
aggrieved the privilege of appealing to the Court of Appeals
from a final order.

Likewise, in section 10(e) the Labor

Board may petition for enforcement.
The question of what is a final order within the
ambit of section 10(f) x*?as left to the Board because that
section is silent as to the definition of a final order.
Therefore, under the basic concept and principle that
exhaustion of administrative remedies must be followed by any

26
litigant before an administrative agency,, Local 134 and
any other litigant before the Labor Board must look at and
follow the Labor Board’s rules if they are not overruled by
higher authority, particularly this Court.
There has been no decision by this Court that the
section 10(k) hearing is a final and appealable order of the
Labor Board.

I think in reading the Plasterers' case we see

very clearly that the two-step procedure, in other words, the
10(k).hearing and the subsequent unfair labor practice hearing
and decision are really two parts of one process designed
and certainly a clear part of the scheme that section 10 of
the statute sets out.

The Labor Board itself has determined

that no appeal shall be had from any 10(k) determination.
Now, the decision in the She11 case was cited to
this Court.

If I might point out, that case presents an

entirely different question because in that case the Labor
Board dismissed the 10(k) notice of hearing, or in other
words said, ”We are making no decision and finding no basis
for awarding the work to either of the competing unions."
The Court of Appeals in the Shell case concluded
that this was not a final order, and therefore was not
reviewable under section 10 of the statute.

I. might point out

to the Court that this is exactly contrary to the decision of
the Ninth Circuit in a waterways terminal case where the
Ninth Circuit held that the dismissal of a 10(k) notice of

27
hearing is in fact a final order and therefore an appealable
order from the Labor Board.
I should note also for the Court that there is a
petition for certiorari filed in the Shell case so that that
issue may be presented to this Court —— or is presented ^.o
the Court, and may be ruled upon later.
Now, -the second area that has been argued as the
basis for overturning the Seventh Circuit decision is that
necessarily an administrative law judge will have to be
appointed to hear the section 10(k)■hearings if the Seventh
Circuit decision holding that the 10(k) hearing is an
adjudication is allowed to stand.
We submit, and have argued in part IV
of our brief that this conclusion does not necessarily follow.
There are a number of reasons why that conclusion does not
follow.

Initially, the argument was made by Local 134 to

the Seventh Circuit that the provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act, section 556 and 557, which prescribe and
require the administrative law judge be appointed, should
apply to this case.
Shortly prior to the argument in the Seventh
Circuit Court of Appeals, the Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia decided the Bricklayers case.

In the

Bricklayers case the Court of Appeals found that the 10(k)
hearings need not have an administrative law judge appointed

28

to hear those matters.

The Seventh Circuit* though* interest-

ingly enough* did not rule upon the contention of Local 134
that an administrative law judge must be appointed
10(k) matters.

to hear

So that we have in the decision of the Seventh

Circuit no finding* no order that an administrative law judge
be appointed.

On that basis* we feel that by affirming the

decision of the Seventh Circuit* there is no requirement
placed upon the Board that it hold its future 10 (k) hearings
by appointing an administrative law judge.
Secondly* we submit that section 554 of the
Administrative Procedure Act is divisible and not necessarily
an integral part of section 556 and 557.

In other words* the

nature of those various sections is sufficiently different
so that they need not be considered as one complete entity.
There is reference in section 554* as in section 553* of the
Administrative Procedure Act to the hearing requirements of
sections 556 and 557.

However, in subsection (d) * particularly

the second paragraph which prohibits the comingling of
functions* there is no reference to section 556.

There is*

I will submit* an oblique reference to section 557* but it is
our position that it does not necessarily follow from the
Seventh Circuit decision that section'

556 and section 557

must apply to all Labor Board 10(k) hearings.
I believe that this Court's opinion* through Mr.
Justice Rehnquist* in the Florida Bast Coast Railway case

29

recognises the general principle that — and in that case it
was section 553,

the rule-making section, the principle

was recognized that it is not necessarily correct or true that
sections 556 and 557 must apply when the provisions of
section 553 apply to an administrative agency hearing»
We submit likewise that it is not necessarily true,
particularly under the posture of the case that has come up
to this Court from the Seventh Circuit and the nature of the
decision that sections 556 and 557 must be applied to the
Labor Board 10(k) hearings.
I think that in this regard also we should notice
and note the fact that the Labor Board itself by its own
rules has promulgated the rule that in 10(k) hearings
administrative law judges need not be appointed.

And as we

argue in our brief in greater detail, we believe that the
principle of exhaustion of administrative remedies applies
here also.

In other words, as long as the Labor Board’s rule

is not in and of itself violative of other provisions of the
Federal statute, such as the comingling of functions is, but
as long as there is no apparent obvious violation of the
Federal statute, then the Labor Board rulesmust b® followed
and we must, as any litigant before any agency, must exhaust
the remedies, must follow the rules prescribed by that agency
for the respective type of matter that comes before the
agency.

In this case the Labor Board says, xt rules that the

30
10(k) hearing will be heard not by an administrative law
judge, but rather by one of its other employees.

We submit

that there is no conflict between the Seventh Circuit decision
and the Labor Board's rules as they now stand which do not
require the administrative law judge.
Finally, I think that the argument that the Board has
made in its, brief, as Hr. Come has noted here today, that it
has consistently followed the practice set out in its rule of
appointing one of its employees other than an administrative
law judge to hear the section 10(k) hearings and that this is,
as Mr. Come says, entitled to great weight, and there is no
change in policy, I think should not be given as much deference
as Mr. Come would have it because this Court in the CBS case
noted to the Board that for many years it had consistently —
the Labor Board, that is, has consistently not decided which
of the two competing unions in section 10(k) hearings would
be entitled to do the work in question.

And in the CBS case

this Court very clearly said to the Labor Board, "You have not
been doing the function which Congress has said you must
perform here, that is, decide and award the work.”

So that

the fact that the Labor Board has proceeded in this manner for
■% many years while it is of some weight, I think is not of

% j.

%

persuasive weight.

And I may point cut to the Court this:

\,The Board has never contended that it consistently or even in
■

%'

cteiy case has had the same employee performing the function of

31
hearing the 10(k)

jurisdictional dispute matter and then

serving as prosecutor in the subsequent unfair labor practice
matter.

In other words, as the Board's brief sets out rather

clearly, this is a rare, if ever, occurrence.
And I think that leads us to our final argument
that there is really no injury or harm to the Labor Board by
the decision of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals,

In other

words, tiie Board is required under the Seventh Circuit decision
to not comingle prosecutorial with adjudicative functions,
and specifically is prevented from appointing the same
employes to the role of hearing officer in a 10(k) hearing
as it has perforin the prosecutorial role in the subsequent
unfair labor practice case.
The Labor Board ~
QUESTION:

Mr. Fitzgerald, has it demonstrated any

prejudice in this case?
MR. FITZGERALD:

I think the prejudice in this case,

your Honor, Mr. Justice Blackmun, is that at the 10(k) hearing,
the employee who was the hearing officer made rulings on
evidence.

One of his basic rulings was that the union was

not entitled to pursue evidence by means of a subpoena as to
the execution of the original contract between the company and
the other union in this case.

And, consequently, Local 134

was precluded from presenting evidence in -support of one of
its major contentions, namely, that the collective bargaining

32
agreement between the company and the other union was not valid.

Now, this ruling made by the hearing officer was
unfortunately of such magnitude that it not only took away
one of our major contentions, but then when the Labor Board
decided the determination of the dispute, the Labor Board's
primary criteria was that there was a collective bargaining
agreement between the employer and the other union.
Now, we submit that the Labor Board's reliance upon
that contract after precluding our seeking evidence,as part
of our position was that the contract was not valid, took
away a very substantial part of our argument.

And .1 might

note that one of the questions, although not decided by the
Seventh Circuit, but which we argued to the Seventh Circuit,
was that there is a clear decision of the Sixth Circuit, the
Dayton Motels case, which holds that the Labor Board slioxild
not close its eyes to relevant evidence merely .because it may
be beyond the Labor Board's time period of the six-month
section 10(b) requirement.
QUESTION;

Might not the same thing have happened

with another hearing officer?
MR. FITZGERALD; It may well have, your Honor.

I

don81 know.
QUESTION;

Then how do you demonstrate prejudice?

By what measure?
MR. FITZGERALD;

I think the fact that subsequently

33

tlie same man who made the ruling on the admissibility of the
evidence then prosecuted the case in the unfair labor
practice hearing,, and» of course» part of the unfair labor
practice hearing was the validity of the Labor Board determina­
tion of the dispute.
But this comingled the two hearings

— the

coirdngling of the function, I suppose, is a more appropriate
way to state it, was psychologically improper.

And the

Seventh Circuit, I think, the nub or the basis of its
decision was that the intent of section 554 is to prevent
this psychological dilemma to be presented to administrative
agency employees.
QUESTIONS

I can grant that and since I think

what seems to be improper — but aren’t you, isn’t your
position one of penalising the litigant through the sins of
the Board'?
MR. FITZGERALDS

Well, I believe, your Honor,

that our basic position is that we should have been allowed
to pursue that evidence and present our full case in the
10 (k) hearing, but v/e were prevented from doing that,

and

as I understand the Seventh Circuit decision, that is the
basis and the exact application of the Wong case that the
Court found applicable to the 10(k) hearings.

I think the

significant part of the Seventh Circuit decision is that
it picked up «and applied the rationale of the Wong case to the

34
Board's 10(k) hearing.
QUESTION:

Wouldn’t your case for prejudice be

stronger if you had a prosecutor in the 10 (k) hearing then
be the judge in the 8(b)(4)(D) rather than vice versa, the
way you had it?
MR. FITZGERALD: I think the court well recognised
that this was the Board’s primary contention» the Seventh
Circuit Court of Appeals recognised that this was the Board’s
primary contention and found the psychological prohibitions
which the Wong case and the Administrative Procedure Act in
section 554 set out to be persuasive.

And I submit that they

are.
QUESTION:
that.

Let me ask you one other question about

Once you find this proceeding subject to 554» can you

think of ciny reasonable way to find that it isn’t also subject
to 556 and would require decision by a hearing examiner?
MR. FITZGERALD:

Well, I think our basic position

there is that the language of section 554» particularly in
section (e)» paragraph (2)» which is the exact language which
prevents the comingling of functions» makes no reference to
section 556.

As I say, there is an oblique reference to

section 557, but we submit that that language of section 554
subparagraph (d), second paragraph, is divisible.

In other

words, it talks about there shall be no coialngling of
functions between an employee engaged in the prosecutorial

35

investigative functions with the decision-making functions,
but it divides the decision-making into three different
categoris:

The recomraended decision, which I submit would be

a section 556 type of ■— more appropriately a section 566 type
of decision.

And then agency process under section 557.

We believe that those are divisible, and as we understand the
Labor Board rule, this is a decision of the Board, decision
and determination of election, and therefore it falls within
the decision category, and we think that these are divisible.
QUESTION:

Both section (c) of section 554, which

is the provision which would carry it over to 556, and
subsection (d) that you are talking about are general
provisions that say that things subject to section 554 shall
be governed in that manner.

I have not been aware of any

construction that could have said that it's subject to 554(d)
but not subject to 554(c).
MR. FITZGERALDs

But I submit that our position is

that these are divisible because subsection (c) and subsection
(d) provide for different types of — or prevent the agency
from engaging in different types of functions.
Now, that

appears to have been the construction

that the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals gave to the 10(k)
proceeding in this case because it did not come down with any
decision to the effect that

administrative law judges

must be assigned in section 10(k) hearings.
