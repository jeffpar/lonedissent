ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES S, RHYNE ON
BEHALF OF APPELLANTS IN 74-878
MR. RHYNE s
Court:

Mr,. Chief Justice and may it please the

The appellants her©, States and cities, challenge

the constitutionality of some 1974 amendments to the Fair
Labor Standards Act which covered all the remaining employe©»
of States and cities under that Act,

The way it was done *.?as

by declaring all States and all cities to be commercial
enterprises, and under that enterprise interpretation, to
apply all of the regulations of the Act to the States and
cities,
I would first of all like to point out that this is
not a minimum wage case.
paid people.

It isn’t a case involvi

the low-

It’s the application of this Act to tho relatively

high-paid people, the wiping out of State and local government,
civil service laws, processes,procedures, the forced
restructuring of the way that they will render fire service,
for example.

It results in enormous increases in cost.

These

are the things that the States and the cities complain of and
say to this Court that this Act is really a very massive

4
complex regulatory Act which in effect reaches every employee,
be he working in the executive, legislative, or judicial
branches of State government.

Now, there are some exemptions

for elected officiale and their confidential aides and for
professional people.

But the interesting thing about the

application of this Act and the claim repeatedly that it's
to correct substandard labor conditions is that in the entire
record made over three or four years in the Congress, the
appellee's predecessors in the Department of Labor were only
able to find, they claim, 95,000 people out of 11,400,000 who
in 1973 they thought could be covered by this Act who were
getting less than the minimum wage, and we doubt frankly that
figure, because it shows here in the record that firefighters
get §12,000 a year, the highly publicized New York garbage
collectors and sweepers get up to §24,500, out in San Francisco
they get almost as much.

So we are not talking about minimum

wages, v;a are not talking about substandard conditions.
What we are talking about is a basic restructuring
of government in the United States of America, a big change in
our Federal system of government, whereby for the first, time
in all history the Federal Government is assarting power over
every State, over every city and every employee they have.
Thera can be no questton about that because, as appellee admits,
yoh have to keep a record for even the exempt people.

So this

is a massive takeover, it's a massive overlapping, duplication,

5
nullification of civil service, debt limit, tax limit, budget
limit laws, and it affects this vast change in power.
talk mostly about power.

And we

Appellee talks about payroll costs

and say they are nothing, but we talk about power of govsrrjaent.
.And we say here that the Federal Government is asserting
jurisdiction for the first time over the most important
element in every State and local budgete the personnel cost.
Cities have 80 to 85 percent of their budget in
personnel coat.

States —< California has 76 percent.

And

other States are similar.
So we say that this Act is a massive takeover of
functions that had been performed on the local level since
the founding of our nation.
I use one illustration of the wiping out of ballot
box control.

In the record at pages 414 and following, there

is a copy of a New Jersey statute.
the platoon system for firemen.

That statute applies to

It says you have the firemen

on 24 .hours or off 24 hours, and they can work 56 hours a
week, but only after that has been approved by referendum of
the local voters.

And no one can look at the regulations that

were promulgated on the 20th of December 1974 by the Wage
and Hour Administrator or the Secretary of Labor and not see
that this New Jersey statute is wiped out completely,

ted

all across this nation, from the New England town meeting to
the referenda that are so popular out West where they have a

6
referendum on almost anything, every time we have had a
fundamental increase in money or fundamental change in providing
unique services uniquely needed by a particular city or State
because of geography and other reasons, there is always the
possibility now of the people voting on it as they did in New
Jersey.

But under this Act and under the actions of the

appellee, that ballot box control is gone forever.
This Ac;fc> as^ I say, is a massive imposition down from
the top of massive legislation that’s already in effect, affecting
State's and cities.

This is where w@ spend most of our money.

They spend, as I say, 85 percent of their money on personnel,
and they have very carefully down through the years developed
civil•service and tenure laws for their people, and now, instead
of — I think this illustrates it best — instead of looking to
the City Council, looking to the local processes, procedures,
the Civil Service Commission of the City of New York or the
Civil Service Commission of the State of New York, what they
do here is they look to the appellee, the Secretary of Labor,
and they look to the Congress because once this power is
established, every kind of employee in this whole nation has
to go to Congress, or can go to Congress to get their employment
status changed.

So they no longer look to City Ball, they no

longer look to tile State Capitol.

This is a vast change in

the outlook, in the power, and it's a centralization

here

in the Federal Government of power over the most important group.

7
Cities are

of legal power.

only act through people.
them.

They can

And this Act reaches every one of

XtJs an assertion of sovereign power over every

employee of a State and city throughout the nation.
One of the experts that X would like to call the
Court’s attention to, to nail down how complex, to nail down
how massive, to nail down the fact that this is a double;
standard of hours and wages,is the Chairman of the Civil
Service Commission.
The Chairman of the Civil Service Commission appeared and I quote from about three sentences from page 9 of our
brief — appeared on the 26th of February of 1975 before the
Committee on Post Office and Civil Service of the House of
Representatives, and this is what he said, "The extension of
the Fair Labor Standards Act of Federal employment is a case
in point.

It adds a new set of complex provisions to the

already existing provision of title V.

It creates two

standards governing pay and hours of work.
double recordkeeping and double work.

It results in-

It is an extremely

high administrative cost —
QUESTION s
MR. RHYNEs

What are you talking about?
I am reading three sentences from

page 9 of our brief, Mr. Justice Brennan.
QUESTIONi
MR. RHYNEs

Your reply brief.
Yes.

I am sorry.

8
QUESTION?
MR. RHYNES

Filed April 12.
Yes.

On page 9? down in the middle of the page» X am
reading three sentences from the testimony of the Chairman of
the Civil Service Commission? who spoke of how complex this
Act When it's imposed down upon the civil service system of the
United States of America and how it imposes double standards?
double bookkeeping? double work for negligible benefits.
• ."••i/.
Now? it's even worse for States and cities because
while the Congress gave this regulatory power to the Civil
Service Commission so that disruption could be avoided? just
think of what it's doing to the States and cities who are all
placed in with commercial enterprises before the Secretary of

Xm&T:
We have in the Act and in its application and this
power shift so many instances similar to the one X cited in New
jersey where the existing law of States is wiped out? where
the existing processes? procedures and such with respect to
employee rights is wiped out.
Now? another thing this Act does? it brings a whole
new set of definitions of overtime? of who is an expert.

There

are 51 pages in the Code of Federal Regulation about what
overtime is.
person.

Thera are 42 pages defining who is an exempt

Now? the Civil Service Commission? and we quote it in

our brief? said they are going to define themselves who is an

9

exempt person.

But my major point is that there is such a

vast shift in power to say what overtime shall he, to say who
shall be exempt, all these kinds of things.

When you impose

those down on the area where States and cities spend the
majority of their money, where they have developed all these
rules and regulations, as in New Jersey,

for years and years,

and the people have voted them in or voted them out, and that’s
all gone now.

You are going to have it imposed from on high

by the Secretary of Labor or by the Congress.
The big impact in one area, I think, is most
dramatic.

And that is in the area of volunteerism.

In the

United States of America in government areas we depend more
on volunteers than any other system of government in the world.
And at the local level we have volunteer firemen, we have
volunteer police, we have volunteer this and volunteer that.
There are millions of them.
Now, this Act when it was written defined employ,
a-n-p-l-o-y, as to suffer or permit to work.

Now, that’s

all right insofar as private industry is concerned, because
they don’t have this volunteer element.

But look at the

States and cities who sometimes pay a volunteer fireman
$2.50 to go on each fire.

Look at the situation that exists

where they sometimes give the volunteer policemen uniforms,
and they sometimes pay insurance on them.
Now, the only answer to that appelles gave is well,

10
you have to take it case 'ey case as to where a volunteer crosses
over the line from being a volunteer to being an employee.
So that creates this consternation all across our nation.
And another area that is going to be very, very
damaging, at the local level we use thousands of interns.

Mow,

frankly, the interns are not worth much to local government.
«

it*s more of a favor to the intern to bring them in than to
really benefit a State or city.

But now they are going to have

to be paid if certain things occur, because interns have to
live and you pay them a little bit, you are going to have to
pay them a lot.
But there is another area where this whole thing
really hurts.

Many of the volunteer firemen, as the record

shows, many of the volunteer policemen are already city engineer
or school teacher.

Now, if they go out as a volunteer on a

fire or for as a policeman and they work in addition to their
40 hours as an engineer or school teacher, a few more hours,
they are ruled to be an employee during their volunteer time
because they receive soma minor compensation, wall, the Act
Says that you have got to pay them time and a half for overtime
'fit their same rate of pay.

They may be a highly paid'engineer

getting $25,000 a year, and when you look at paying him overtime
for his volunteer fire work or his volunteer police, you just
mess up the structure of volunteerism throughout our nation.
I don't think thera has ever been anything that has so caused

confusion and this mass of confusion was referred to by Mr»
Allen Pritchard, the Executive Vice President of idle League of
Cities in the record here, saying that no one could really
tell whore you are and where you are going because you have
all of these complex regulations imposed suddenly down on
already complex, already regulatory regulations of the status
and tenure of city employees.
But perhaps one of the most devastating fears of
States and cities is that this Act creates class action.

You

don't have class actions against cities under their current
setup, but they do have fair hearings, they do have cases, and
as we pointed out 30 many times, one-third of all litigation
before State courts is really involving

personnel matters.

So here you have this Act saying that you can,either the
appellee or an employee can bring a class action.

He gets

attorneys fees, he gets costs, and you get double time, triple
time if you win.
Now, for a mistake in determining whether a man has
crossed that line as a volunteer, or for a mistake as to
whether the intern gets too much, the damage is enormous
because they can make a mistake of fact or law in a city like
New York, it can run up to enormous, enormous costs.
QUESTION?

Mr. Rhyne, I suppose the Darby

Lumber Company made most of the arguments you are making now
when it sought to challenge the exercise of Congress under the

1

commerce for passing the Fair Labor Standards Act applicable
to private businesses.

Certainly, private business, when the

Act went into effect in 1938,had to make very, vary significant
changes.

I take it your point is that not only are there

changes, but that this is somewhat different than just
Congress imposing regulation on a private business.
MR. RHYMEs
is.

Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, it certainly

1 think commerce is commerce and business is business.

And in this area here, you didn’t have a lot of private business
that had laws.

You see, private business can't legislate,

adjudicate, tax, so they are an entirely different category
than the private businessman.

He can immediately adjust to

Cities and States have to give all

kinds of notices or wait until you come around to the next
budget year, and things like that.
that

Darby,

So X am not sure at all

presented the same kind of impact.

I don't

think so, because you didn't have the civil service laws in
States similar to the Federal civil service law.

You didn't

have all of these appeals that you have there to civil service
commissions or personnel commissions.

You didn't have, all of

that kind of thing.

And you certainly didn't have the Volunteer

situation xn Darb^.

So X think this is entirely different,

and actually the basis of our whole argument is a distinction
between government and commerce.
QUESTION:

Have you made any arguments that weren11

13
made in Maryland v. Wirtg?
MR. RHYNE2

I think we have, your Honor.

1 think

that we have here presented the massive impact of this Act
upon States and cities looked upon as an entirety,
QUESTION s

So you would leave Maryland v. Wirt a

alone?
MR, RHYNE:
QUESTION:

I would not,

I would not,

I would say

So you think we must overrule Maryland v,

Wirtg?
MR, RHYNE:
overruled.

I would say I would like to see it

There are soma distinctions, but I can tell you

what are the distinctions I draw.
QUESTION:

But to hold for you We must overrule

Maryland v. Wirfcz?
MR, RHYNE:

No,

But I think it should be.

1 think

like the lower court which said it was troubled and that the
broad language of Witts, that this Court might want to pull
back from.
QUESTION?

I suppose you could think of a lot of

cases in the book that you think ought to be overruled.
MR. RHYNE:

I am just thinking of this one right

now,
QUESTIONS

I know you are thinking of this one,

but why is it involved in this case, Maryland v, Wirts?
MR. RHYNE:

my isn't it?

14
QUESTION?

Why is it?

Why do you think we should

overrule it?
MR. RHYNEs

All right.

I think you should overrule

it, number one, because it is so fussy you can * t really tell
I ara going to the ultimate now — what ife decided.

You left

open, for example, the ultimate consumer question.
QUESTION!
MR. RHYNE;
QUESTION!
MR. RHYNE:

Why is it involved in this case?
Why is it?
Yes.
Because after looking at the enterprise

system and upholding it as applied to all these private
business criteria and all these private business cases, the
next thing the Court did, majority opinion, was say, now that
we have upheld that Act as applied to these criteria of nexus
to commerce, it's always been applied in a private business thing,
we don't find enough of an impact on States here to bring the
tenth amendment into focus.
Now, of course, hospitals and schools, they don't
legislate, adjudicate, or tax, so there is —- and then, too,
the court pointed out there, the court below, that these
»*■

schools and hospitals were in competition with private business.
Sb I would say to you, Mr. Justice White, we are presenting
ah entirely different, in many ways, factual picture to you,
and we think that distinguished Wirta there.

But we'dlso

think that as the dissent in Wirts said, if we uphold this

enterprise system as to schools and hospitals, then the
Congress can declare an entire State an enterprise

and the

Federal Government can regulate its entire budget»
QUESTION?

Well, if you can distinguish it, that seems

to be one of your objectives, why not tell us what ~
MR. RHYNE:

Well, the distinctions I would draw, Mr.

Chief Justice, are theses

Number one, the Court didn’t

decide the ultimate consumer question you had here now before
you in Brennan v« Iowa.
Number two, it seems to limit the application of the
Act to those schools and hospitals which are in competition
with private schools and hospitals.
And then, finally, it seamed to say to the dissenters
when they say you can take over a whole State by declaring it
an enterprise, the comment was not while this Court sits.
So I think there are factual distinctions there
which show that Wirta hasn't had the impact on State and
local governments that tills massive takeover has here.

But

I still think that the Court should have in Wirta considered
the principles of constitutional federalism which we urge
upon this Court.

And it didn’t,

I just said because we have

already upheld this commercial enterprise, the tenth amendment
doesn’t mean anything.

Go ahead and apply it.

So I would say to Maryland v. Wirtz that it does not
control this case because 2 draw from the principles of

16
constitutional federalism, and certainly we have in our
briefs gone into this very, very deeply, this general rule
fcfhat under the constitution as it was written even prior to
i^vs tenth amendment all of the framers of the Constitution were
enunciating this idea that the Federal Government could not and
would not interfere with the States in their area of operation,
as Mr. Chief Justice Marshall said i« McCulloch v. Maryland,
and vice versa, there would be no interference.
And where do I find that rule?

X find it in the decisions of this Court.

X believe there has been an awful

lot of fuzzy thinking about everything in our whole nation
being commerce, and it isn’t.

Certainly the act of a policeman

The act of a fireman in

State or of a city in deciding a case isn't commerce.

The

action of a zoning board in deciding a zoning isn’t commerce.
Now, all of this kind of thing, Mr. Justice White,
was not presented in Maryland v. Wirtz.

As far as X can tell,

and I have read all the briefs in that case, and there in no
reference to it in the majority opinion, and I think these are
the kind of thing that the dissenters were concerned with.
They were saying you get a mighty small perspective on this
whole problem when you are just looking at hospitals and
schools, and now we are presenting the whole picture, and when
you look at the whole picture, there is certainly a massive
intrusion, a massive control by the Federal Government for
the first time in the history of our nation of every person,
every service rendered by States or cities, because what this
Act. does is it rescrambles the way they are going to do fire

service, it rescrambles the way you are going to do a lot of
things.

And we say it imposes enormous cost.

impose enormous costs, that's one thing.

And when you

But the big thing

we talk about is the shift in power from the States to the
Federal Government.
Now do we want it?

Isn't this a massive interference

with our constitutional system of shared power, our Federal
system?

We talk about federalism, federalism, federalism.

Wall, federalism has served this nation very well and up until
now States and cities have fairly taken care of their
employees who have collective bargaining statutes and agreements
\y

and thousands of their members belong to unions, as you can
see from the amicus briefs here.

All of that was haver

forcefully presented, as far as I can tell, in Wary lanci y,
Wirt a, and here I could not say more strongly than I have, 1
just think that we are looking at such a major shift of
governmental power in our nation, something we have never
had before, and when you look at the necessity of it, what
does the appellee say?

He says that in 1973 when they were

considering this Act, it would oinly increase the payroll cost
of States and cities .3 of 1 percent.

He says also, in 1974,

it would only increase the payroll co3t ~ and that would be
$120 million a year, incidentally — and in 1974 it would
increase the payroll cost only one-half of 1 percent or
$165 million.

He says these police and fire regulations that

19
he put out in December will only cost $37 million.
QUESTION :

How many employees are covered by these

amendments?
MR. RHYNE:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, all employees

of States and cities are covered because you have to keep a
record on each one of them.
QUESTION:
MR. RHYNE:

MR. RHYNE:

How many are those?

The ones exempt from the —
Under the professional exemption and

such?
QUESTION:
MR. RHYNE:

Yes.
We have a great dispute among us as to

how many that is, the elected people.

So I think the safest

thing for me to say is we are looking at the whole of it
because they require that a record be kept with respect to
State court judges, all the exempt people.

So I think that

the pervasive nature of it, the fact that it touches everybody
that is a State or city employee, I don91 think can be
disputed.
QUESTION:

What if you look at it from the point of

view most favorable to the government, that is, the most
i

limited number of people who are actually affected by the
minimum wage and overtime provision?

Honor.

figures as to the exact numbers.

And we don't have

Now, they claim that very

few were covered under the hospital thing, very few covered here
I think they claimed less than half of all the 11,400,000
are covered.

But I say that has no constitutional significance

because they claim power over them all.
QUESTIONS

If less than half are covered, that would

still be four or five million/,?
MR. RHYNE:

Yes.

I think they will admit up to

6 million.
QUESTIONS
MR. RHYNE:

I wouldn't call that de minimis.
Well, they say that has only a showing

that they are not covering everything.
de minimis either.

I don't call it

But they are attacking the statement made

by Congress that because in the overtime area, for example,
States and cities have such fair overtime premium laws now
that there would be less than 1 percent added to the payroll
by the new overtime provisions of this Act, and things like

that.

New, I just think that de minimis, de minimi a, da

minimis doesn't create constitutional power, find I find here
in all of this history of constitutional federalism a sturdy,
steady, unwavering adherence by everyone up until now, including
the decisions of this Court, that the constitutional federalism
is something that limits everything in the Constitution where
you have a conflict between two governments.

You have the

tax power, you have the bankruptcy power where time and time
again this Court has said hands off States, hands off cities.
You hava cases like in the transportation field where over -Maryland v. Johnson, for example, where the Court held, and
Mr. Justice Holmes wrote the opinion, said don’t try to get us
to decide this on these commerce cases involving private
industry.

It has nothing to do with it.

about here is government.

What we are talking

And so on the basis of that, he

held it was invalid for Maryland to charge a postal truck
driver a $3 driver’s license fee.
So the amount regardless of how many you have on
either side should not decide this case because I think on
this record it is beyond question that the Congress is claiming
power to regulate every State and city employee, and I believe
that the factual picture of this overwhelming massive change
in government, the centralization here of everything, with
everybody running to the Congress if they want a change in
their personnel status.

Thank you, Mr. Rhyne.

Mr. Jones.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF TALMADGE R. JONES ON BEHALF
OF APPELLANT IN No. 74-879
MR. JONESs
Courts

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

I bring to the Court what must surely be a simple

and true proposition, but which has nevertheless escaped the
attention of our distinguished Congress, namely, that the
States are governments, not commercial enterprises.
We examina today the constitutionality of the 1974
amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act, an effort to
convert the States into enterprises and thereby regulate and
control the minimum wages and the maximum hours of their
respective employees.
I wish to briefly outline the unforeseen consequences
of tiie amendments on the California civil service system and
then, time permitting and if really necessary, to point out
tile unconstitutional dimension of this unprecedented intrusion
into the sovereign sphere of State government in the name of
commerce.

mental function of State government, namely, fire suppression.

QUESTION?

Were these full time or does that include

volunteers?

MR* JONES:

These were professional firefighters,

your Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:

Full time.
Full-time firefighters from the cities,

the counties, the State all joined together to fight these

24
tremendous holocausts we have in California.
QUESTION:

What are the total number of employees in

California, if the record shows this?
MR. JONES?

The total number of permanent personnel,

your Honor, is over 2,000 in the California Division of Forestry.
QUESTION:

I am not speaking of just the forests.

I am speaking of all public employees who would be subject to
having their wages fixed under this Act, not just reporting.
MR. JONESs

I can't give you the exact statistics

on that, although I think the Court can take judicial notice
of the fact that in California there are more Indians than there
are chiefs, namely, the supervisory and professional executive
exempt, what the Department of Labor claims are exempt, and we
still don't know who those are, those are far less than the
number of employees that are covered.
QUESTION;

Well, the State of California must know

how many public employees there are in State and local govern­
ments .

Now, what's the point of this dramatic redii'tation of

they work they take in the winter months which they prefer so
they can work secondary jobs and visit with their families
during the holidays and the like, and you don't hear the
California Employees Association complaining about the current

arrangement.
Yet according tp the Fair Labor Standards Act now
we have got to reduce these men to 60 hours per week and
pay them time and a half for every hour in excess of that and
our ability to recognize this overtime in other than cash is
completely eliminated because the Fair Labor Standards Act
requires that if you are going to give then', compensating time
off, you have to do it within 28 days or pay the bill.
Now, what possible business is it of the Federal
Government to dictate how we run pop fire service program in
the State of California when it has been proven satisfactory
for all these years?

The impact is $23.6 million annually

to change our practices in accordance with the Fair Labor
Standards Act.
What about volunteerism?

other gratuitously.

They furnish these services to each
In some of the type of fires I mentioned

a moment ago, the big one, the uncontrollable fires, the
Fair Labor Standards Act is going to wipe that out.

The

impact on mutual aid alone in California is $6 million, because
volunteerism — because these firemen are firemen, when they
are pulled in to cover a reserve unit while the rest of the
crew goes and helps a neighboring jurisdiction, overtime rules
start applying, and the bill is a big one.
We may point out that the National League statistics
on this thing, on the effect of this Act nationally, is very
conservative.

They estimate it at $200 million, and they base

that on paying overtime to all the firemen affected. That's
a conservative figure.

What the Fair Labor Standards Act would

like us to do, and what we based on statistics on in the
State of California, is reducing those hours and hiring new
employees.

The Act wants us to hire new employees.

So if you

take that figure, if the National League had gathered those
figures, we would be talking about $400 million annually to
State and local governments.
The other adverse effects on civil service have been
demonstrated by Mr. Rhyne, I think, very well during his
argument.
Another thing that you don't realise when you start

27
fooli.no around with the working class salaries at Stata levels
is that you suddenly create compaction problems in the supervisor
classes, too*

Let’s remember that if you start paying overtime

and adjusting the wages of the working line fireman in State
and local service, you are going to be paying the Indians more
than the chiefs, and that's not going to last very long.

So

the rippling effect all the way up through civil service is
going to be felt, and we have no idea what those figures are
going to run, but they are going to be big ones,

hnd ones

which we think can't be supported in fact or in the Constitution*
QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, about a generation ago the

State of California was back here saying it was none of the
Federal Government's business how it ran the Baitline Hallway.
And this Court in a unanimous opinion gave fairly short shrift
to its argument, said that if Congress wanted to exercise
the commerce power, that was Congress' prerogative.
MR. JONESs

My

I disagree.

to draw any lines

I think if you look at

those early cases you will see they are easily distinguished
from what we ar© talking about here.
Let ms emphasize that virtually all State employees

28
are covered under this Act.
QUESTION:

I suppose one difference is that the

State of California, or any other State, can run or not run
a railroad, but they have no choices about running or not
running police departments and fire departments, isn’t that
one difference?
MR. JONES:

That is correct, your Honor, and that is

the very next point 2 was getting to.

The Solicitor General

argues that the FLSA does not affect the policy-making powers
of local government but merely the means by which we implement
that policy.

Your point, your Honor, is right on site, namely,

there is no election, there is no election.

We have to provide

fire service and police and law enforcement.
Mr. Justice Marshall said in his concurring opinion
in the Employees of the State of Missouri v. the Department of
Public Health when we were talking about Article 3, immunity
of the States, that the States couldn't waive their immunity
because they have, no election, they have no option.
'salve what you have no opportunity to waive.

You can91

You have to

provide fire service, you have to provide police service.
Therefore, any imposition by the Federal Government is a
mandate.

It has nothing to do with discretion.

So let’s

be clear that this Fair Labor Standards Act is a direct
intrusion, a mandate, into State and local governments.
We would like to see the Wirfea case overruled, because

QUESTION:

What you want this Court to do is to

decide this case on its facts and then in the last sentence
say, and while we are at it, we will overrule Maryland v. Wirtz.
That5 s really what you want.
MR. JONES:

That's an excellent suggestion, your

Honor.
(Laughter.)
Of course, in brief, at least, on behalf of the
State of California I haven't said that directly, but I have
attacked Wirtz from so many sides that you have to draw that
conclusion.

This is not a Wirtz case.

The State is not an

enterprise.

This Court has specifically held in many cases

involving Federal Acts that if we are going to talk about
what affects commerce and you want to talk about enterprises
affecting commerce, then be specific.

And I talked about

two recent cases of this Court, very recent cases not two
months old, that lament the lack of specificity in these
Federal Acts

30
QUESTIONj

You want us to overrule those,too, while

we are at it?
MR. JONES $

No, it’s not necessary, your Honor.

I

think that you held in one of those cases that Congress had
not been specific.

They have not been specific here either.

They are not talking about schools and hospitals.

In fact they

took schools and hospitals right out of the Act and now they
say all State employees, except who -the Department of Labor at
its pleasure decides should be exempt.

We think that Wirta,

of course, is irrelevant, it could be overruled simply on the
fact that because a State purchases its goods in interstate
commerce, it's thereby engaged in interstate commarce.
»

A question this Court has never addressed itself to
is what do the States and cities and local governments do with
tha goods they purchase in interstate commerce?
them up and sell them to the public?

Do they mark

Absolutely not.

Even

the Fair Labor Standards Act itself recognizes that ultimate
consumers of goods purchased in interstate commerce are exempt.

on, are ultimate consumers, exempt from the Act.

State employees go out on strike, we get things called injunc­
tions, and they go back to work.

And nobody has pointed out to

me showing that there is any labor strife in California that
requires the Department of Labor to regulate local activity.
Your Honors, the Fair Labor Standards Act touches
the very heart of State sovereignty and is a patent denigration
of the constitutional right — yes, I said the constitutional
right -- of the sovereign States to deal with their employees
in a manner best suited to local needs.

Simply stated, the

Act Is unconstitutional, and we hope and we trust that this
Court will so hold.
Thank you, your Honors.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK ON BEHALF
OF APPELLEE
MR. BORK:
Courts

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

I take it that the crux of the argument we ar© having

today is really the impact of the 1974 amendments

of

the

Fair Labor Standards Act upon State and local government
, ■i J

it

sovereignties, or to put it another way, upon the system of
federalism established by the Constitution.
I think the issue, therefore, is whether Maryland v.
Wirta should be overruled and the position of the didsent
there become the new law.
I intend to devote myself primarily to that question
because the preliminary matters seem to me to be too plain to
require much additional extended discussion.
QUESTION:

I take it that means you see: no

difference between policemen and firemen on the one hand and
hospital attendants on the other, as far as constitutional

purposes.
MR. BORK?
Chief Justice.
a

Not for the purposes of this case", Mr.

This does not — this statute does not require

to give up any payments, or any number of policemen

a*nd fireman.

A State, if it does feel financially pinched, and

33
I think it will not for reasons I will come to? can give up
peripheral services which are not inherently governmental,
which in no sense of the word are inherently governmental.
QUESTION s

should it become the business of the Congress

of the United States that they should give up peripheral
services.
MR. BORKs

It's not the business of the Congress of

the United States to tell them what they must give up, and
this statute does not.
QUESTIONS

Is it the Government1s position that that's

the balm on this vround that we heard about this morning?
MR. BOSK;

Ho, no.

I think in the first place, Mr.

Chief Justice, I fail to see the iround for reasons I will
develop.

But in the second place, I think this is a very

unintrusive statute, much less intrusive than many kinds of
statutes that are concedadly valid under the commerce power.
As we have said, this statute does not tell a State that it
must give up any objective or that it must pursue any substantive
objective or any program.

It leaves the States free entirely

to choose all of its programs, keep them all, abandon any one
it sees fit, but it does not have any policy control over the
State, as many Federal statutes do, which are valid under the
commerce clause.
But I thought I would spend a moment upon the
commerce clause, predicate hero before coming to the issue of

34
whether federalism is in some sense threatened.

I think there

can be no doubt that interstate commerce is involved when
State and local governments in 1971 purchased goods and
services worth $135 billion which was at that time 12 percent
of our gross national product.

And 1 think there can be no

doubt of the significance of these 1974 amendments to inter-"
state commerce when we realize that they extend the coverage
of the Act to an additional 3.4 million State and local
government employees. The 1966 amendments upheld in, Maryland v.
Wirtz extended the coverage to 2.9 million employees.

So that

there are now a total of 6.3 million employees protected by
the Pair Labor Standards Act.
And there are a variety of reasons why this wages
and hours law is rationally related to Congress9 power to
control commerce, and 7. will merely sketch them because I think
they have been upheld in so many decisions of this Court that
they need not be argued at length.
The first, of course, is simply that substandard
working conditions can lead to labor disputes which interrupt
the flow of goods and services across State lines.
QUESTIONS

Of course, the kind of reasons you are

giving now are equally applicable to a private business.
MRc BOEK:

Thate s what X meant,Mr. Justice Hehnquist,

when X said X would spend just a moment on the predicate treating
this as a commerce power case before we come to the special

35
problem appellants raise about the fact that

it?s State and

local governments.
That labor strife theory, of course, is in the
congressional findings in the original Act.

It is the basis

of this Court upholding the 1966 amendments and their application
to State and local government in Maryland v. Wirta.

It was

advanced by Senator Javits in debate in advancing the 1974
amendments, and of course, it is the theory under which the
?

National Labor Relations Act was upheld in Jones v. Laugh!in„
Competition again between governmental units and private
industry, which is required to comply with the Labor Standards
Act Is an unfair method of competition.
Third, competition between governments essist.

And

if some governments use substandard labor conditions and
compete with other governments for new industries, new
residents, tourists, rather than raise taxes, lower working
conditions, they will tend to spread those working conditions
to other governments that are trying to compete for the same
industries and residents and tourists.
And in that connection I would call the Court's
attention to the brief amicus curiae filed by the State of
Alabama, Colorado, Michigan, and Minnesota, States who
apparently feel that their sovereignty is not seriously
threatened

here, and at pages 6 and 7 of that brief, which £

will not go through, they explain the competition between

36

governments and why that competition justifies the kind of
v''. :■

statute, amendments, wa have here.
JNad particularly I would call the Court's attention

to the advertisements in the appendix which show the State of
Massachusetts advertising in the Sunday New York Times in
March of this year to attract industry with tax incentives
and the State of New York advertising in Fortune Magazine.
QUESTION;

Your earlier argument to the Chief Justice,

as I understood it, was that this law has no effect on Stats
policy choice.

Now you are in effect, it seems to me, saying

that the State is to be precluded from the sort of thing that
Massachusetts is doing.

It's not to promote tourism at the

expense of employee salaries.
MR. BOSK:
was simply this s
wishes.

What I meant by that, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

It says a State may follow any policy it

The only limitation upon that is any policy it wishes

to follow nay not be done at the expense of workers being
paid substandard wages.

But it does not attempt to dictate

the policy that must be followed or tell the State

that it

must eliminate any policy.
QUESTIONS

General Bark, for which States was this

brief filed?
MR. BORK:

There were two briefs filed.

The original

one, it's the identical brief, all that happened is that in
the second filing the State of Minnesota was added.

It's

37
Alabama# Colorado# Michigan# Minnesota.
QUESTION;

I just don41 have the second filing.

X

wanted to be sure about the red brief.
MR. BORN;
filed.

The red brief.

There were two red briefs

They are identical as far as I can see.
QUESTION:

Minnesota didn't take the trouble to

supply enough at least so that I got one.
MR. BOSK;

The fourth theory that supports the

commerce power here# of course# is the one cited in Kafcgenbach
v. McClung# which is that the increase in purchase power that
follows from

setting a floor upon wages and so forth does

benefit interstate commerce.
And# finally# of course, Congress believed# as the
Senate report said# that raising a minimum wage rate at a
level which at least helps assure the worker a decent income
at or above the poverty level is essential to the reduction
of welfare roles

and overall reform of the welfare system in

the United States.

And I would think that obviously spreading

the work through overtime requirements and requiring minimum
wages is a way of getting people off welfare rolls and trained
as productive workers# and that is of obvious importance to
interstate commerce.
But these considerations# these various theories#
have been so many times accepted by this Court and so overwhelmingly support, that commerce clause predicate of the 5 74

37 A
amendments that I think the real argument and the one I want
to spend my time on is the argument about federalism»
How, there is no doubt, of course, the States enjoy
no absolute immunity from commerce clause regulations, and the
cases to that effect were cited in both the majority and the
dissent in Maryland v» Wirts and in fact there is no doubt
that the commerce clause may be used to regulate what one might
think of as an essential governmental function similar to fire
or police protection.

For example, in Sanitary District v.

United States, Chicago was prohibited under the Federal power
to control navigation in the aspect of commerce from diverting
water from Lake Michigan in order to carry away sewage, which
2 would think is an essential governmental function.
The real argument is not that there is an essential
governmental function that may not be touched.

It's that these

amendments sweep so broadly and have such an impact that they
imperil State sovereignty

and our entire constitutional

system of federalism.
How, that contention is advanced here in very heated
terms,

indeed, in apocalyptic terms, so that at first glance

one might think that this was a very serious constitutional
case.

But 1 think upon calm analysis, it will be seen that

the only substance to appellants5 argument here is a mixture
of misunderstanding of the statute and a capacity for unlimited
hyperbole.

Appellants ask this Court to overrule Maryland v.

33
Wirfcz, and I will not dwell upon, the doctrine of stare decisis,,
nor will I dwell upon the reliance of Congress

and a variety

of individuals upon the 1966 amendments and upon Maryland v.
Wirtz, although those are obvious factors which support the
appellee Secretary of Labor here.
But I want to go to the policy question, and I want
to speak to the constitutional policy question, and I want to
speak to those issues under the Constitution which indicate
that Maryland v. Wirtz should be followed.
The question raised by the dissent in Maryland

v.

Wirtz, and I take it it is the same question being raised by
the appellants here, is does this Federal regulation overwhaIra
State fiscal policy?

Does the principle that must necessarily

underlie the validity of the 1974 amendments permit the
Congress virtually to draw up each State's budget?
The answer to that, I think, is unqualifiedly no,
it does not.

The commerce power does not permit Congress to

destroy federalism.

Federalism is also a constitutional

principle,
QUESTION:

You would concede, then, that Congress

does not have the same freedom under the commerce power to
regulate activitie.3 of States and cities as it does those of
private businesses?
HR. BORK:

I wouldn't use the word "concession”, Mr.

Justice Rahnquist, because I think --

39
QUESTION?

You would affirm it.

MR. BORK:

I would affirm it.

Congress could, under

the commerce power, I take it, perhaps, nationalise private,
much of private industry*with compensation,
could nationalize it.

of course, but they

I take it there ±3 no doubt that

Congress could not take over State government and make the
r-

States merely administrative satrapies.
of that.

No, there is ho doubt

And if this case involved any tiling like that,

appeallants would have a very strong point.

This case involves

nothing of the sort.
QUESTION;

Do you agree with the figures that were

suggested this morning that the pay of personnel working for
State and local governments in the country, in municipalities
generally, is about 80 percent of the total cost of government?
MR. BORK:

As I understand it, in municipalities

the budget is 80 to 85 percent wages.

However, the effect of

these amendments upon that share of the budget is under 2
percent, which means that we are talking about less than 2
percent of SO to 05 percent of the budget.
QUESTION:

Are you measuring that 2 percent by the

increase'fchat will be involved to bring them up to FLSA
standards?
MR. BORK:

Yes.

I think that is correct.

The best

estimates, minimum wage law and overtime regulation.
QUESTION:

But it reaches into by the figure you

mentioned 85 percent of the total coat of government of
municipalities, is that the figure, 85?
MR. BORK:

Yes,

I believe California's figure was

70 percent.
QUESTION;

76, I think he said.

MR. BQRX;

He said 76.

QUESTION:

Was that for State and local?

MR. BORK:

I think in the brief it is

No, I take it that was State.

It reaches

into in the sense that it applies to about half of the State
employees now, and it will have an effect upon 80 to 85 percent
of the State budget.

But I don't regard that as a meaningful

figure because the effect it will have is very 3light.

It is

spread very thinly across a large part of the State budget.
QUESTION:

Is there anything that would limit the

power of Congress to raise the ante, just double the wages
arbitrarily, or treble them or quadruple them?
MR. BORK:

Yes, I think there are a variety of

things that prevent that.

One thing that prevents it is —

and this is not my whole answer, but I think it is a realistic
answer that is worth giving --is the political make-up of
Congress.

Congress is drawn from the States.

State parties

are quite powerful.
QUESTION:

You. are talking about a practical,

political consideration.

I am talking about is there anything

41

constitutionally to prevent —
MR. BORK;

I think there is.

I think there is.

The

practical political consideration I regard as constitutional in
the broader sense, the way our political parties and our nation
is constituted.

We have a structural protection against that

kind of thing happening.
The second line in the constitutional law sense is,
of course, this Court, and I think if this Court ever sees that
States are being deprived of political autonomies so that they
are no longer vital policy-choosing and policy-making centers,
this Court can say the value of federalism is being impaired
and strike down the statute involved.
QUESTIONS

How could we make a principle distinction

if we uphold this law and the case posited by the Chief
Justice then does by some perhaps fluke of the political system
come to us?
MR. BORIC:

You can make a principle decision only in

this sense, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

When this Court has over

the centuries attempted to find a formula for confining the
commerce clause, they have never found an adequate formula.
I suggest to you that you will never find a mechanical, bright
line distinction which will tell the Congress, you may do this
to the States, but you may not do that.

It is necessarily, as

in many constitutional matters, a question of degree, a
question of balancing.

And I think it is not unprincipled to

42
stake judgments of degree, to say there is a spectrum hare,
we will cut it at this point.

That,I think,Is not unprincipled.

And that, I think, is the only kind of test that9s available
in this area.
But let me, in approaching this matter and showing
why if this Court were to draw a line and say we are going to
strike down a statute of Congress to preserve federalism, X
would think that thi3 statute would be one of the last choices
this Court would make.

There are other statutes which this

Court has upheld which I think are far more intrusive upon
fi

.

•

federalism than this statute, for reasons I will develop.
But I would like to add a dash of realism to the
discussion so far, just to put the matter in perspective.

And

the first point about that is that it is true that the
Federal Government, contributes far, far more of the State
budget than this measure will ever cost them.

In 1975

Federal aid to State and local governments is expected to
total $52 billion.
QUESTION:

They can stop that any time they want to.
-r

MR. BORK:
Justice.

They can stop that any time, Mr. Chief

I am just suggesting that realistically in terms of

the drastic impact we are being asked to see here.

This is

not much of — and in fact, I would suppose the kinds of
conditions upon employment here could have been added as
conditions to the grants.

43
QUESTION:

How does that furnish support, for a

constitutional argument in this area, Mr. Solicitor General?
MR. BORR:

I think it does it only in the0 sense

we have heard this morning extensive argument about policy
issues and Congress shouldn't do this because it’s going to
cost us the following amounts of money.

I agree that those

arguments perhaps have been addressed by the appellants to
Congress rather than to this Court because they are not
constitutional arguments as they were put.

But I think it's

relevant at least in counterbalancing that to realise that
we are talking about a Pair.tabor Standards Act which would
have less than 2 percent impact upon a State budget, and the
figure I just cited means that the Federal Government is
financing about 22 percent of State and local expenditures.
So that these 1974 amendments are not, as matters now stand,
going to swamp any fiscal policy.

They hardly begin to measure

up to what the Federal Government pays the States and local
governments.
The other item of realism that X would like to
inject is that this cry of the destruction, the imminent
destruction, of federalism

has been raised in this Court

in commerce clause cases ever since John Marshall was Chief
Justice, and X think it's no more accurate here than it was
ih Gibbons v. Ogden.
One of the more recent poignant examples of this

44
kind of rhetoric appeared in fact in the plaintiff State's
brief in this Court in Maryland v „ Wirta. I enjoy this
particular line *

The States then said in Maryland v. Wirt2,

"Never before in the history of this nation has the Federal
Government presumed to enact a law which both in theory and
in practice serves as a basis for the utter destruction of
the State as a sovereign political entity.6'
Now, that rhetoric so closely resembles the rhetoric
of the briefs here and of the oral argument here that I begin
to think that perhaps it must be boiler plate somewhere for
resisting the exercise of the commerce power.
QUESTION;

Isn't it a camel's-head-in-the-tent kind

of argument?
MR. BORK;

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, it is a camel's-

head-in-the-tent kind of argument in part, in part. The brief
referred to this, and the oral argument does, as massive
takeover, complete usurpation, et cetera, at cetera, which I
take it is not camel's nose, I take it that's the whole camel.
But then they back off and say, well, it is camel's nose because
you allow this, then you must go all the way.
QUESTION;

Well, whatever it is, more of the camel

is getting into the tent under this Court of Appeals holding
than was in the tent before, is that not true?
MR. BORK;

Every time a commerce clause regulation

is passed of any kind more of the camel is in the tent.

1

I

45

would suggest to you that this statute is less intrusive than
most of the other kinds of Federal regulations under the commerce
clause upon the area of State sovereignty than the other kinds
are, and that therefore if one is looking for, is calibrating
the camel's nose for the danger point, one would not choose
>

.V

this statute as the place to see the danger point.
But oddly enough, despite this rhetoric in Maryland v.
Wirtn, which as I say so closely parallels the rhetoric here,
the States were not destroyed, they were not even damaged, and
I take it they seem to be healthier in many ways than they were
at that time.

So I think just in terms of the rhetoric we are

talking about and in terns of the money we are talking about —
I mention this merely to suggest that the appellants' argument
about the imminent fall of the Republic is entitled to be
taken with a large dollop of skepticism.
Nov;, I .would like to make just three points about
federalism.

First, in enacting these 1974 amendments, Congress

was very responsible with a very responsible process, and indeed
it was very sensitive to State and local problems and to State
sovereignty.
Second, I will argue that the law here involved is
simply not of the type which is mo3t threatening to State
sovereignty and is by nature much less intrusive than other
concededly^/valid exercises of the commerce power.
And third I will argue that even if one ignoras

46

completely federal assistance to State budgets, the financial
impact of the 1974 amendments is far too small to be thought
threatening to State sovereignty in any way.
Since the appellants accuse Congress essentially of
negligence and failing to males estimates and make a credible
study of the cost impact and so forth, it's important to
realize what Congress did and the responsibility of the process.
This is not a case of an unconsidered statute wreaking unpredicted
havoc, it’s not that at all.

I would draw-the Court’s attention

to the amicus brief filed in this case by Senators Williams and
Javits and particularly at pages 5 to 13 the Senators describe
the process which Congress went through here.

They had before

them a detailed study of the cost impact of the 1966 amendments
so that they could be guided by experience.

They had before

them a detailed study of the feasibility of extending the
Act’s coverage as was done in the ’74 amendments.

They had

calculations of cost and they held lengthy hearings.

The

National League of Cities, an appellant here, expressed Iri
those hearings the concern about the overtime requirements as
applied to firemen.

In response the Senate-House conference

wrote section 7 <k) which I will discuss later and which permits
a departure from the Act's other overtime requirements precisely
to meet the kind of problem the National League of Cities and
California are talking about.

And Congress also exempted

from coverage, I might say, not only executive, administrative,

47
and professional personnel, but also persons who hold public
elective office, members of their personal staffs, persons who
serve at a policy-making level, and So on,
QUESTION:

Could Congress include them if they chose

MR. BORK:

I would asstime, Mr. Chief Justice, that the

to do so?

question — they probably could include, for example, administra­
tive or supervisory personnel.

I don't think it's necessary to

reach that today to decide this case.
could.

I would assume they

I think the question is,is the State seriously hurt,

is the State no longer a viable policy-making, policy-implementing
center because of what Congress' has done, rather than a question
of the category of persons covered.
QUESTION:

When we talk about Congress could do it,
'

4

.

,

it really brings you back to the conventional test and
constitutional adjudication of any enactment of the Congress of
the United States.

Inquiry one always is,is this enactment

within the expressed or implied powers of Congress conferred
upon it by the Constitution of the United States?

That’s your

first Inquiry when you talk about could Congress do this, and
you spent briefly the first part of your argument saying, yes,
so far as the commerce power goes, yes, it can, Congress could
do this.
The second inquiry always in the conventional
procedure of constitutional adjudication when what is involved

48
is the validity of an act cf Congress, is even if within the
power, does it run into some other prohibition or impediment
contained in the Constitution of the United States, be that
impediment or prohibition in the bill of rights or in some other
provision explicit or implicit in the Constitution?
So in answer to the Chief Justice' question, you
said it could, and I suppose it. certainly could from the point
of view of tiie power of Congress under the commerce clause.
The question is could it from the point of view of some other
impediment in the Constitution?
MR. BORKs

I had meant, Mr. Justice Stewart, to

answer that by saying it could obviously in terms of the
commerce power per se, and when I said —
QUESTION:

The question is something may well be

clearly within the commerce power, but also a clear violation,
for example, of the first amendment.
MR. BORKs

I had meant to say when I said that I

didn't think it depended upon the category of person, but
depended upon more that the States were in some sense destroyed
as sovereign entities.

That was a case where you are running

into the countervailing interest of federalism, which I fully
concede or affirm, it is a countervailing constitutional
principle which must be taken account of.
QUESTION*

And I gather you concede that there is

a point with any similar legislation where that impediment or

49
prohibition would make an act of Congress unconstitutional
even though within its commerce power„
MR. BORK:

That is entirely true, Mr. Justice Stewart.

If Congress passed a statute tomorrow which says that every
State employee should be paid $50 an hour and it so became
impossible for State governments to operate, I would think that
that would be not only seriously in question, but I would
expect that it would be unconstitutional as a destruction o£
»

federalism,

'

had that’s why I say these things --

QUESTIONS

Would it also perhaps implicate a

violation of the obligation guaranteeing the States

a republican,

form of government?
MR. BORK: Is$think it might.

It seems to me the

republican form of government clause has a lot more in it than
we have conventionally taken out of it.
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose in the situation you posit

that it would certainly be implicated whether or not the
Congress had betrayed «its obligation to guarantee, would it
riot?
MHi BORKi

I didn’t mention that one solely because

ft pleads one into the argument about whether a republican form
of government is a political question and whether it is
justiciable and so on.
M

■

But I quite agree with you that I think

'I-' .1 ' ‘

whether or not it is justiciable, that would be a violation
of the obligation that it states to guarantee every State a

50
republican form of government.

But also it runs back into

the principle of federalism.
QUESTION:
MR. BORK:

The structure of the Constitution.
That's correct,

Well, the principle of

federalism, as appellants quite rightly point out, is built
into the structure of the Constitution.
basic.

Nothing is more

And my argument here has in no way suggested it is

not basic and must not be protected.

It simply is that this

statute does not threaten that principle.
So my point is the Congress was concerned with the
preservation of State and local autonomy in terms of general
financial impact, in terms of particular local problems which
they adjusted the statute to take care of, and in terns of
exempting anyone in any degree of proximity to policy-making.
And they tried to preserve the value cf federalism and my
remaining two points are that they completely succeeded.
The first one is that this amendment, these amendments.,
are by their nature less of a threat to State sovereignty
than most concededly valid exercises of the commerce power.
This is a conceptual argument.

I will come to the financial

impact in a moment which is a factual argument.

These

amendments do not tell a State other than paying standard
wages instead of substandard wages, they do not tell a State
it must follow any policy objective.
to follow any policy objective.

It does not forbid them

The law merely says that

51
whatever policy you choose, you will not carry it out by paying
the workers who carry it out substandard wages and putting them
under substandard working conditions, which 1 think is a
quite modest constraint»
Now, that constraint conceptually is a much smaller
interference with State sovereignty than a Federal substantive
statute which tells the State that from now on you may not have
a State law on this subject, it must be the Federal law»

Now,

that is an intrusion upon State sovereignty.
QUESTION:

I am not at all sure I agree with you on

that point, General Bork.

Under the supremacy clause

if you

are talking about Federal regulation of a universe of private
individuals versus State regulation of the universe of private
individuals, certainly the implication -- not implication, but
the provision of the Constitution says that the Federal
Government acts within its delegated authority of the commerce
clause, it shall be supreme.

But I don't regard those

preemption cases as being necessarily a guide to the situation
where Congress seeks to work its will not just on privateindividuals or businesses who happen to be in a State, but
on the State itself.
MR. BORK:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I would urge upon

you that they are identical in that sense.
two ways:

Let me put it in

One is — between two individuals.

If individual A

is doing 50 things which he enjoys, wants to do, and individual B

52
has some power over him and says, "You will not do item 3 any
more. From now on you will do what I want.”
49 that he wants to do.

So he is loft with

Or individual B says, fiI don't care

which one you give up, but you have to give tap any one you
choose."

I take it the first is a far more coercive, intrusive

interference with ait individual's autonomy and hence by analogy
with State sovereignty than the second.
QUESTION:

If you are right, then you are wrong in

conceding that there is any federalism limitation on the
commerce part because this Court has said time and time again
where it is simply a private business challenging Congress’
regulation under the commerce clause without asserting any
affirmative constitutional defense of his own, the power of
Congress is plenary, there is no limitation whatever.
MR. BQRK:

I doubt that that would be — I know that

the Court said that in those cases, Mr. Justice Hehnquist,
I think they are quite distinguishable cases in this sense:
Perhaps I can illustrate it by going to Maryland v. Wirta.
The dissent there was afraid that if the power to set a floor
under wages,

and set a ceiling over hours was conceded, the

same principle might be extrapolated to the point where the
Congress could draw up the State's budget which would; he a
destruction of - federalism.
Now, I suggest to you that the same thing might
have been said about the National Labor Relations Act which

53
was upheld in Jones v, Laugh 1 in and deals with much the same
subject matter as this.

People corae in and say you are ousting

a State policy in the area of labor-management relations
completely.

Whatever the State wants in this area doesn't

matter any more, the Federal Government will tell them what the
law is.
Wow, the objection could have been made, if we once
admit the principle that the Federal Government can do that,
then it follows that the Federal Government can draw up the
entire legal code of the State, and I suggest to you, Mr.
Justice Rehnquist, if the Federal Government acting under the
supremacy clause suddenly decided to draw up the entire legal
codes of all the States for them, that this Court would say that
goes too far, you have destroyed federalism.
QUESTION:

Well, so long as it was able to tie it to

the commerce clause and certainly a lot of congressional
legislation has gone far to supersede otherwise valid State
legislation.
MR, BORIC;

I know it has, and I think the question is

always one of the aggregate impact.
of degree.

The question is always one

I cannot believe that this Court is really willing

to concede that using the commerce clause Congress can write
every law a State has.

And it can virtually do that under

modern interpretations of what affects commerce.

At some

point you can turn a State into nothing more than a geographical

54
area»
QUESTIONs

And you say that a private individual could

assart that to the same extent that a State could.
MR. BQRKs

1 don't see why not if the private individual

happened to be hurt and a major constitutional value liras
in play,

of course, perhaps a State would come in,

But I

take it if a Stats case in and brought an action to have the
National Labor Relations Act declared unconstitutional rather
than a private individual because it interfered with State
sovereignty, I take it-~and made the same argument I just mads,
that this principle would allow the Federal Government to draw
up tiie entire State code, I take it that this Court would have
upheld the Act just as much as it did when a private individual
brought the lavrsuit.
But that is indeed my point that a law which does
not oust a State policy but merely says choose your own
policies, there is going to be a slight additional cost in
standard working conditions, is a less coercive, less intrusive
less threatening to State sovereignty form of law.

And if you

uphold the Federal statutes which actually oust State policy
from whole areas, then this lav?, I should think, is not the
law to start being concerned about federalism.
QUESTIONS

The difficulty is in the other examples

you have given us the State often just isn't aware of the
threat or even relaxes and enjoys it.

MR» BORK;
QUESTION:

Well, I assume
We don't get the argument from the States»

we get it from private individuals.

I am thinking about the

things such as the validity of the Federal anti-loan-sharking
law which was upheld in this Court with only one dissent, or
this Federal Labor Relations Act, for another example.
States don't see their interest affected.

The

And you are telling

us they are more gravely affected by that sort of legislation
than by thi3.

But here the State sees the threat, and therefore

we get the argument in these cases.

In an adversary system

perhaps we don't fully consider the argument or apprehend it
in the other cases in which you have already told us you see a
greater threat to federalism.
MR. BORK:

I think the kind of thing is greater.

I

would trust that when a private individual comes in and says
that State sovereignty is being destroyed, that the Court
would not say, well, the States seem to be relaxing and
enjoying it, so we will uphold the statute on that ground.

I

wogld trust the real consideration is what is happening to the
system of federalism, not are the States willing to consent.
QUESTION:

But in an adversary system of justice you

have to have adversaries, and in those other cases the State
has not been an adversary.
MR. BORK:

That

is true.

That is true, But I take

it the same value is in play, and I take it that the Court

56
puxports in those cases to address often the question of
interstate or intrastate, which is a way of protecting federalism.
So that they do pay attention to the principle,
QUESTION?

Of course, in many of those cases where

the commerce clause legislation was upheld, the States were
happy to have it upheld because there had been a no-man’s land
before.

The States couldn't regulate because it was interstate

commerce, and the Federal Government couldn't regulate because
there was some defect in congressional authority.

So your

cases in the thirties that uphold commerce regulation by
Congress, that was basically with the full approval of the
States.
MR. BORKs

It may be, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, With the

full approval of the States. I think the labor-management
relations was not a no-man's land, there were State laws,
there were State courts, Congress was not happy with what the
State courts and the State laws were doing to labor-management
relations and ousted the States from that field.
QUESTIONS

In 1938 hew many States had comprehensive

labor laws of that kind?
MR. BORKs

Well, they may not have been comprehensive,

Mr. Chief Justice, but they certainly had a common law —
QUESTION

Even skeletal?

MR. BORKs

Well, they had common law labor relations.

i

M>

I recall, one of Congress' complaints was that it was too

57
easy to get injunctions out of State courts.

It was a

developing law in labor-managemenfc relations, it wasn't a very
happy law of labor-management relations, which X think was the
reason Congress entered the field.
QUESTION?

Your point is well made if the State

policy is to have no lav;.
MR. BORK?

That's right.

If a State chooses to have

no law and let the thing be fought out by the adversaries,
still the entry of the Federal Government is an intrusion upon
a State's policy choice.
I do not quarrel with those cases.
those statutes was the correct decision.

I think upholding

All I say is that

this statute is less of an intrusion upon sovereignty than
those statutes and therefore if one is to draw the line, one
*i- ■ ..!.*}

•

.

.

would not draw it with this statute.

This is my sole point

about it.
And I should say that it's hardly even theoretically
Possible that one could use a wage and hours law in a wUy that
virOrtijlLd destroy State sovereignty because they are tied
he'fis&asarily, as long as they are similar, to the wages land hours
ive.cpilred of private employers and indeed of the FedefEa$|
f^Ve;Knaient as an employer.

The impact upon State and local

ge;vs:r'i'intent cannot be so severe that State sovereignty is
destroyed.
These theoretical distinctions or considerations

33
seem to me in and of themselves sufficient to rebut
appellants' predictions of impending doom, but 1 would like
to move on to point out that appellants have also rather
thoroughly misunderstood the statute and its impact upon them
so that the extravagant figures, claims of takeover, and so
forth,are not really accurate.

The charges made are so

plentiful and reflect such a rich and varied misunderstanding
of what's involved her© that I can only touch upon the major
items.
First, the charge is that the 1974 amendments would
cost some unspecified number of billions of dollars.

There

doesn't appear to be any foundation for that at all.

The

1966 amendments had no impact even beginning to do that, and
there 13 nothing in this case that supports any such speculation.

We have had a breakdown of the items.
Now, the impact, as I said, is on 409,000 workers,

95,000 new workers covered by the statute and 314,000 workers
covered by the '66 amendments now have the minimum wage raised
to $2 from $1.80,

j|ut the appellants' theory of this case

would, of course, strike down the 1966 amendments also, so
that I assume about 409,000 workers

would be vulnerable to

substandard wages.
But their principal concern appears to be the
overtime requirements of the Act, and that concern, I must
say, is greatly exaggerated.

The premium for work over 40

59

hours a week can. be avoided by using additional employees on
a straight time basis.

That will spread employment and that

is what Congress intended.

When they complain about that, I

can only say that, of course, this statute does require States
to do some things, not very many, differently than they might
otherwise do them.

That is the purpose of the statute.

But the only specific national figure they give for
the overtime cost is an estimate of $200 million for fire
protection services, and we agree that most of the costs of
this statute will be indeed overtime costs.

But this $200

million that is mentioned is a vastly inflated figure.

It is

based on the assumption that local governments will not take
advantage of the exemption of section 7(k) which I mentioned
earlier which was put in in the Senate-House conference on
this bill, specifically because of the concerns expressed
about firemen and overtime.

And that section 7^k) provides

that no overtime pay is due unless the employee works an
average of over 60 hours per week in any 28-day period.
Now,, only about 10 percent of the firefighting personnel in
this nation work in excess of 60 hours per week, and even
the appellants as. to that 10 percent apparently calculates
only about $30 million in additional cost across the nation
for them.
Now, California argues in its brief that these
firefighters, their firefighters, work an 84-hour weak during

60
the fira season and that this Act would have drastic results
with respect to them.

I can see no impact of this statute

upon the California system as it was described thi3 morning.
The 84-hour week.■ they describe in the California brief - works
as follows:

The firefighters work four 24-hour days on followed

by three 24-hour days off, followed by three 24-hour days on,
and four 24-hour days off.

Now, California assumes, since

there is an 84-hour week in there, that it will have to pay
24 hours of overtime every week.

But that is not the case.

Under this statute, since these firefighters are on duty for
over 24 hours continuously, sleep and meal time can foe
deducted.

So if you deduct sleep and meal times from this,

they will not exceed 60 hours a week and overtime will not be
due.
Now, in this connection California complained rather
bitterly about the compensatory time.

The firefighters work

very hard during the season and take time off in the non-fire
season.

3ut compensatory time does not arise as a problem

under these amendments unless you work the firemen more than
60 hours a week.

If they don’t work the firemen more than

60 hours a week, they can give them compensatory time or
anything else they want in any way they choose without
interference from this statute.
So the entire system described this morning seems
to me to fit well within the statute and not to impose the

61
kinds of additional costs or problems that California is
talking about.
Now, the next matter of records and reports which
seams to be confused almost beyond recognition.

The question

of reports which are discussed in the brief is simple.

The

Act does not require the preparation or the filing of any
report.

The question of records is about as simple.

me say this:

And let

When the appellants say that this Act reaches

every employee of every local and State government, it does so
only in the 3ense that even exempt employees must have a record
kept.

But if we look at the nature of the records, they are

records which are not required by the Federal Government to be
kept in any particular form, and the only information they
require is information that any employer would obviously have
about his workers,
QUESTIONS

It's the most elementary kind of thing.
Are they subject to inspection the same way

private employer records of wages and hours are paid and kept?
MR. BORIC:

Yes, they are.

What one must keep is the

employee's name, the date of his birth, his address, his
social security number, and except for exempt employees, the
daily hours he works and the total wages he earns.

Now, that

as a recordkeeping requirement seams to me well within what
any employer must keep as a matter of course.
Now, the appellants have tried to confuse this issue
by quoting at length from Robert Hampton who was the Chairman

62
of the Civil Service Cononi salon who was complaining about, the
application of this statute to the Federal system, and the
Federal system as at page 9, and my brother Rhyne read from
page 9 this morning, I would point out that Robert Hampton
had a special problem.

Congress when it passed this statute

3aid you must give the Federal worker

whichever is better,

title V or the Fair Labor Standards Act.

So that they do have

to keep records under title V which is different and under the
Fair Labor Standards Act, and they double computations and
•*

•

-

figure out in each case which gives the employee the better
result.

No such requirement is imposed upon the States.

So that Mr. Hampton's complaints are not relevant to the
States.
Now, the Act does preserve the State may keep more
beneficial statutes than this if it wishes, but they are not
mandated as they are for the Federal Government, and therefore
Mr. Hampton's remarks are quite beside the point.
Now, as to volunteers, the Act as it has been
interpreted and as it is enforced does not prevent the use
of volunteers in any part of State government.

And, indeed,

reimbursement for reasonable expenses is allowed aa a guideline,
for example, for volunteer fire departments, $2.50 per call
will not even be questioned.

Above $2.50 per call they may

look at it to see whether the amount of reimbursement bears
a reasonable relationship to the cost incurred by the volunteer

63
firefighter.

But he may be a volunteer above that price.

And, by the way, the Labor Department has made a study.

The

average volunteer fire department call is 20 minutes.
Now, there was reference to collective bargaining.
This statute does nothing to collective bargaining.

Employee

unions are free to bargain collectively for anything above
these standards they wish.
The civil service processes.
protection remains in force.

State civil service

State civil service processes

to protect the workers remain in force.

They are not ousted.

Now# we have answered a variety of other charges in
our brief which I shall not go through here# and the various
amicus briefs answer charges.

But I think what it boils down

to is the appellants* case rests upon misunderstanding of the
statute and alarmist rhetoric.

The real complaint is that the States have lost the
power to determine this matter for themselves, isn't it, rather
than that they have lost the power to pay substandard wages?
MR. BORK:

The only power they have lost, Mr. Justice

Rehnguist, is to determine to pay substandard wages»

They have

not lost the power to pay more than that, they have not lost
the power to adjust in a variety of ways.

And I think the

power, as I suggested perhaps too many times, the power to
pay substandard wages must be less important to State
sovereignty than the power to enforce your own social policy
within your borders.

The commerce clause allows the Federal

Government to override the latter.

I cannot believe that the

power to pay substandard wages is the place where we suddenly
trench upon the value of federalism,
QUESTIONS

(inaudible)

It's a nice rhetorical

phrase, substandard wages, but it means more than that.

It

means technically every hour worked over 40 hours a week is
time and a half and maybe an employer wants to say, well, I
want you to have a regular week of 50 hours because of the
particular needs of the municipality or this particular public
service and not be bothered with computing overtime.

And that

may or may not be substandard in the ordinary economic sense

65
of the word.

He may be getting higher wages.

But he doesn't

want ail this nonsense with the federal bureaucratic red tape
when he is running his municipal government,
MR. BORKs

Well, there is not much bureaucratic red

tape/ and furthermore substandard obviously refers to a
national standard set for private industry and for the
Federal government.
QUESTION:

It's a rhetorical phrase but it involves

a good many rather technical rules and regulations.
MR. BORK:

Well/ it would necessarily involve some

technical rules and regulations.

I might say that when a

locality has a good case that they have to do something soma
way as in the firefighters case, Congress has proved responsive
and made an adjustment.
It would not be true to say that this statute will
not require soma public employers to change some ways of doing
business or of governing, if you want to put it that way, but
of affecting interstate commerce, but that’s the purpose of the
statute.

It may spread jobs.
QUESTION:

I think that was the point, as I understood

it, of my brother Rahnquiat's question, that's the question
here, whether or not the Federal Government is impeded by the
structure of the Constitution from exerting the power to
change the way the municipalities and the States want to do
their business with respect to their employees.

66
MR. BQKK;

I gue33 X do two things.

I guess I

say in the first place that the State and local government
work force is expanding quite rapidly and is continuing to
grow.

It is now, I think, about 14 percent of our national

work force and is going up.

And to say that that is exempt

from all of the protections we extend to Federal workers and to
all private industry workers is to make a rather large statement
that unless there were compelling constitutional reasons, I
don't think we ought.

I think there are not compelling

constitutional reasons, because it escapes me why State
sovereignty is threatened by being required to pay a dime or
two more an hour or is threatened by being required to pay
time and a half over 40 or over 60 hours, or to hire additional
workers, is a massive intrusion upon a State's political and
governmental autonomy.
We have done all kinds of substantive laws that
tell the States, You may not have laws on the subject..

This

seems to be a much less intrusion.
QUESTION:

What if this statute had required all

Statas and local governments to bargain collectively with
their employees in a matter of wages and hours.

You would

you., that this large segment of employees shouldn't be

employers?
)

Would that raise any more difficult constitutional

67
question?
MR. BORKs

I wotsld have exactly the same arguments

available to me, I would think.

And X don’t think it's a

difference of constitutional dimension that that would be a
larger intrusion than this one.

This, if you look at what is

actually done, the degree of impact is really not that large.
It’s been vastly overstated here.

Every extension of the

Fair Labor Standards Act has been met with these cries of
takeover and destruction.

It simply hasn't happened.

Well, I have addressed myself to the concerns of
the Maryland dissent which I think are the real concerns in
this case, and I have shown, I submit, I hope I have shewn,
that this measure does not involve or imply the Federal
intrusion upon State sovereignty that that dissent feared.
And for that reason, and because we permit easily other kinds
of Federal ousting of State policy which are far more intrusive,
I suggest it would be illogical and arbitrary to draw the line
at the commerce power here in this case.

And I therefore

ask that the judgment of the district court be affirmed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERx

Mr. Rhyne.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES S. RHYME ON BEHALF
OF THE APPELLANTS IN NO. 74-378
MR. RHYNE:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

I take it that my distinguished adversary admits that

there is such a thing as constitutional federalism that exists.

But ha says that unless an Act of Congress# if I heard him
right, unless an Act of Congress really wipes out the ability
of a State government to be a viable government, you don't
call it into play as a bar against legislation.
Now, he says that

the States are not hurt here,

that this isn't enough of an intrusion.

But I call again to

the Court's attention the $3 license fee was too much for Mr.
Justice Holmes in Johnson v. Maryland when you are talking about
a matter of power.
mental power.

We are talking about a matter of govern­

We are not talking so much about money,but

on money, they say that our figures are exaggerated.
the record proves just to the contrary.

Well,

This man who gave us

the $200 million estimate of cost of fire services to comply
with

this Act is the greatest expert there is in the United

States on this subject.
There is one other little thing the distinguished
Solicitor General keeps talking about — confusion.

If there

is any one thing that is confused in his whole argument, it's
this;

He talks about working 60 hours or 84 hours.

Now,

the plain truth is that of that 60 hours or that 56 hours in
New Jersey, so much of it is what you call stand-by time,
in the record at page 321 it's pointed out that when you are
on duty for 24 hours and then 24 hours, that you have in that
24 hours, the first 24 hours you have 16 hours of stand-by
time.

So these people are there, but only the difference

starve them to death»

And just as in New Jersey, if they are

going to go to a new platoon system, if they are going to change
the overall system, these people in the New England town meeting
or across this country, they vote on it, up to now they have
been able to vote on it.

And I think the most important

-question was from Mr. Justice Brennan when he talked about the
republican form of government, because the biggest part of that
republican form of government is ballot box control.

And,

Mr. Justice Brennan, it's gone if this Act is upheld.
Now, my distinguished colleague, the Governor of
Utah, Governor Rampton, leaned over to me and he made a statement
that I think I should pass on to you.

He said, If they uphold

this, there is no other stopping place from the complete
swallowing up of State government under the commerce clause.
And there i3 no logical place, just on and on, you talk about
the National Labor Relations Act, well, those Acts are all
being held over here in committees in Congress until you act
or? this.

If you uphold this, frankly, cities as cities are

gone, they are commercial enterprises.

And I just don’t believe

that anyone can read the history of our nation, when you come
to a new claim of power you have to go back to the sources of
power.

A mention was made by the Solicitor General about

this being so minimal, it didn't have any impact at all.

But

I will remind the Court, I will remind the Court, as I was
reminded again by Governor Rampton, that the impact of the tea

71
tax in Boston was minimal, but the principle was more than the
people could stand to have someone else taxing them, someone
else running their local affairs.

And this is what the States

and cities are fighting for here.

That's exactly what they are

fighting for here.
Now, this idea that this Act has no payroll impact
is not only a false statement, but that is not the point at all.
The point is who is going to determine that payroll impact,
and this is just the beginning, the camel’s nose under the
tent.

That's certainly very, very true.

And look at the

enormous impact that just this one ruling that a fireman who
works 24 hours on the job, you can't deduct his sleep and eat
time, but for every other person in the entire nation you can.
So there is no misunderstanding on our part, we know
what this Act says.

And he tries to justify it by saying, oh,

well, this might help welfare, it might help unemployment.

And

then he said, in any event, we give you $52 billion in revenue
sharing.

Well, again,Governor Rampton's note to me,

he said it Is very presumptuous to imply that State sovereignty
is for sale for $52 billion or any other term.

After all, that

money is the people's money that's being returned to them.
The idea that you can pay for it and take over the State is
totally repugnant to our whole system of government.
1 believe that the concession, both by the Solicitor

General, by the Congress in its report that this would have
v.

72
virtually no impact, on cities, the concession by Senators
Javits and Williams in their brief that it would have no impact.
Why do it?

Why take over?

Why take over?

about California, that's completely wrong.

And the statement
Sleep and eat

time is included in 84 hours or 72 hours or SO hours.
been up till now.

It has

And the only thing that they say, they

say they are not forcing States cr cities to do anything.
They are.

This 24-hour no-sleep, no-eat thing is going to

force them to hire an awful lot of new firemen and maybe some
new police, and as Mr. Jones pointed out that's a very, very
costly thing to hire and train all of these people.

After

all, -the States and cities have got along pretty good up
until now, and again I would reiterate over and over again,
over and over again, there are no substandard labor conditions,
there is no justification for this Act,

any way, any how,

no matter how you approach it.
And the one thing also that I think is not
particularly a happy thing to have represented to this Court,
that the Governors and Mayors who presented these figures
that were included here of $200 million and a billion in
costs are liars.

I don't think they are.

I think they can

make just as good an estimate as a lot of other people.
I think, they made honest estimates.

And

They are honest people,

they are hard"working people, and they live there with their
own people.

So I think they gave their very best estimates.

73
And certainly this

well, for example, in the House

committee report they estimated the first-year impact of this
Act on the entire Federal Government.
$250,000.

Do you know what it was?

I saw the Postmaster General sitting back there a

few minutes ago and I saw a statement by him the other day
that $60 million of his deficit is caused by this Act.

I tried

awfully hard, and I found a publication to that effect.

I tried

awfully hard to get some other figures, but all they tell me
was it's just awful, you can’t get it.

And the idea that the

Civil Service of the United States and the Civil Service of
States is that different is just plain dead wrong.
So Mr. Rampton is right.

You've got all of these

statutes of States that they have been building up for 200 years
trying to be fair with these people, and, after all, if they
are not fair they are there to tell them about it.

They live

with them day in and day out.
So I think that here where this Act really obliterates
the division of governmental power upon which our whole nation
is founded now is the time, in the Rampton view, and the view
of the Governors he represents as chairman, and of all of the
Mayors and other public officials, now is the time to put a
*

stop to this.

Let's call government government and commerce

commerce and not try to turn just by a few words —- whoever
heard of a statute, this is the only one I have ever seen
where it calls commercial enterprises governments, and over and

over again defines them so right in the statute.

They say

a commercial enterprise is a city* public agency.
that8s not true.

Well*

This idea of competition that was mentioned

in connection with Wirt?.* well* the court below found there
was no competition here.

They don’t like that.

The idea that

somehow or over because governments might compete with each
other —- well* that’s preposterous.
ever see is when they bid

The only competition 1

against each other for a city

manager to improve their whole operations of government.
So 1 would just correct one other thing.

I have a

letter here from 'the Governor of Colorado instructing his
Attorney General to withdraw his name from that brief that
was just called to your attention.

And the idea of, the

Solicitor General said* all you have got to do is comply with
7(k) and than you have no problems.

Well* you comply with

7(k), you have to comply with this rule 24 hours on you
don't deduct sleep and eat.
So I started out by saying that we don't have
substandard conditions here* and what do they come up with?
This figure of 95,000 faceless wonders that they got from
nowhere* and there is no evidence whatever* not one scintilla
that those 95*000 exist, and without that* their substandard
idea is gone forever.

Cities are not here fighting to maintain

substandard labor conditions.

States are not here fighting

to maintain substandard living conditions.

These are their

75
people , they live with them, and we feel that they should
continua as they have for 200 years,and to tear up this system
of shared governmental power that has worked so well in this
Bicentennial year would be a monstrosity indeed,
1 end by saying government is not commerce, and I
ask the Court to recognize that government is government and
commerce is commerce and that this decision below should be
reversed because even there the court doubts very much that
tills Court would want to stick with some of the broad language
tha'fc was contained in Wirtz, but they felt district court
judges shouldn't overrule this Court.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
