ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK R. PARKER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PARKER:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

Petitioners removed the Mississippi criminal

prosecution from State court to Federal district court- pursuant
to the civil rights removal statute 28 U.S. Cods, section 1443,
which dates back to 1866.
motion to remand.

The State filed an answer and a

The district court in evidentiary hearing

on the State's remand motion, granted the motion, remanded
these criminal prosecutions back to the State court.
On appeal by the petitioners, the court of appeals
for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, and a divided court by a vote
of 10-5 with a-very strong dissent by Chief Judge John Brown
denied a rehearing en banc.
The question for review is whether petitioners
engaged in peaceful free speech activities designed to
eliminate racial discrimination.
V

They removed State criminal

‘ • _

prosecutions against them to Federal district court pursuant
to the civil rights removal statute to protect their peaceful
exercise of rights secured by Title I of the Civil Rights Act
of 1968, which is contained in the Federal Code under the title

"Federally Protected Activities,"and as codified as 18 U.3. Code,
Section 245(b)«
I think it's undisputed, the State doesn't dispute
this in its brief, that at the time of the arrest the
petitioners were and had been engaged in free speech activities
specifically protected against official interference by 18
U.S. Code, Section 245(b).

The police officers knew this, and

this activity formed the basis for these arrests.
The petitioners all \«;ere arrested on identical arrest
affidavits sworn to by the Chief of Police, which charged them
with unlawfully and feloniously to bring about a boycott of
merchants and businesses and there promote, encourage, and
enforce acts injurious to trade or commerce, under Mississippi
Code Section 97-1-1.
Mow, although the testimony of the Police Chief who
was the only witness to testify for the State does contain
reports and complaints that he had received that there had
been some interference with the merchants and the shoppers,
there is no evidence at all in the record that any of these
petitioners themselves are guilty of any of this unlawful
conduct, guilty of harassing or intimidating any shopper or
merchant.

And the State cites none in its brief.
The petitioners

were arrested solely and

exclusively because of their peaceful free speech activities
designed to protest and eliminated racial discriminatione

As

5
petitioner John Ferguson testified, and his testimony was not
contradicted, when he was booked he heard Police Chief Brown
of Vicksburg comment, "Anybody on the street with a picket
sign will be arrested," and that's what happened.
QUESTION;

Doesn't it have to show under Peacock that

they have an unqualified right to do what they were charged
with doing and not just that they had an unqualified right to
do what they in fact might have been found to be doing?
MR. PARKER;

Mr. Justice, we believe that the

evidence in this case does meet the Peacock standard.

First

of all, the statute in both Section 245(b) does establish a
right for them to engage in this activity, and secondly —
QUESTION:

What activity were they charged with in

the Mississippi criminal prosecution?
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION;
MR. PARKER:

The evidence —
I mean the charge, not the evidence.
The charge was to unlawfully and

feloniously bring about a boycott of merchants and businesses
and to promote and encourage acts injurious to trade or
commerce.

Now, this necessarily must involve free speech

activities.
QUESTION;

But don't you have to show under Peacock

that the Federal statutes you rely on gave them an unqualified
right to feloniously and injuriously do what they were doing?
MR. PARKER:

We think that's true in this case.

The

6
Fedex'al statute does give them an unqualified right to engage
in free speech and peaceful assembly to oppose the denial of
the opportunity to participate in the enumerated benefits and
activities under the statute, including private employment
without discrimination.

So the defendants under this statute

had an unqualified right to engage in free speech activity
opposing racial discrimination in employment, and that was the
purpose of the boycott.
QUESTION:

But they were charged with doing something

more than that, weren’t they?
MR. PARKER:
Honor.

No, we don't believe they were, your

We believe they were specifically charged with protected

activity under the statute.

And certainly even going behind

the charges, the testimony of the Police Chief himself when he
was asked, “What were these petitioners doing prior
arrest,” responded,

o their

They were stopping people and telling

people not to shop in the store that there was a boycott on.
And the purpose of the boycott, as the testimony reveals, was
to protest racial discrimination in employment.
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

That1s the evidence; that's not the charge.
That was the basis of the charge.

It

was -that, but —
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

It's not the charge itself.
Well, the charge of boycotting and the

charge of restraining trade necessarily contains elements which

7
contradict the protected activity guaranteed by the statute
because the boycott necessarily involves word-of-mouth
publicity, free speech activity, to persuade shoppers not to
stop in the stores, and that's specifically protected by the
statute.
QUESTION:

I take it, then, you would suggest that

when an indictment like this is filed, or its information is
filed, that you would have been entitled to dismissal of the
indictment if you had moved to dismiss and cited the Federal
statute, that the Federal statute is an absolute bar to the
prosecution.
MR. PARKER:

That is the relief that we are requesting

in Federal district court.
QUESTION:

I know, but that's what you say should

have been granted if you had moved for it in the State court.
MR. PARKER:

I think the posture in the State court

would have been more constitutional question whether the
State statute under which the charges were brought are over­
broad
QUESTION:

You are suggesting, though, that the

Federal statute is a defense, a

full,1

complete defense

to going forward with the charge at all.
MR. PARKER;
QUESTION:

Yes, that's correct.
And I take it you agree that that is the

test under Rachel and Peacock.

3
MR. PARKER:

Court laid down.
necessary test.

That is one of the tests that the

However, we don't believe that this is a

In other words, if the petitioners in Rachel

had not been charged with the trespass — in Rachel they succeeded
and the court sustained removal — if the petitioners in
Rachel had not been charged with trespass, they had been
charged with aggravated burglary, for example, or murder or
rape, the result should have been no different, because the
facts of that case clearly showed and were alleged properly in
the removal petition that the charges were based upon their
refusal to leave the restaurant after they were asked to do so
because of their race.
hearing.

And that's the purpose of the evidentiary

Rachel requires an evidentiary hearing in district

court to establish the fact and permit petitioners to prove
the allegations of the petition.

And once they have done that

and shown that the arrests are based on protected activity,
then they have a right of removal under Rachel.
The testimony, as I mentioned, of Police Chief Marion
Brown himself indicates that the basis of these arrests were
the free speech activity of the petitioners protesting racial
discrimination and that, of course;, is protected specifically
by the statute.
Now, these mass arrests, as the testimony, uncontra~
dieted testimony, indicates brought a complete halt to any
picketing in Vicksburg designed to protest or elixainafce racial

9
discrimination.

And that complete halt of any racial protest

picketing in Vicksburg continues down to the present day.
X think from these facts the conclusions that can be
drawn are clear.

These arrests were made in bad faith.

They

were solely for the purpose of harassing these petitioners
in the peaceful exercise of their federally protected free
speech rights to protest racial discrimination.

They were

mads under a State conspiracy statute which is extremely
questionable, punishes any acts injurious to trade and
commerce, punishes any acts injurious to public health,
public morals, using vague terms and overbroad terms which
can be easily used to suppress free speech rights as was done
in this case.

And this was done to the great and immediate

irreparable injury of petitioners and persons similarly
situated.
Now, the purpose of Congress in enacting this removal
statute — and it goes back to 1866.

It was re-enacted in

1870, re-enacted in 1871, and Congress in 1964 took another
look at this removal statute and provided an appeal to
strengthen its provisions.

Congress has over the past century

tended to provide a Federal forum in instances in which
conduct by State officials violates

equal civil rights

of petitioners and those rights are denied and cannot be
enforced in the State court.

In enacting the civil rights

removal statute, Congress carved out a narrow but express

10

exception to the usual doctrine against Federal court
interference with State criminal prosecutions.

Under 1443,

removal of State criminal prosecutions to Federal district
court, this is justified where petitioners can rely upon a
right under any law providing for the equal civil rights of
citizens, and Kachel construed this to mean stated specifically
in terms of racial equality.
So we are not arguing that the court include in the
civil rights removal petition a broad spectrum of what we
generally classify as civil rights or constitutional rights
or civil liberties.

This is a very narrow statute, it can be

narrowly construed, but covers this case, because this statute
undeniably, and the Fifth Circuit held that section 245(b)
clearly deals with equal civil rights.

This statute

undeniably is a statute providing for equal civil rights
stated in terms of racial equality.

And that's indicated by

the legislative purpose of the statute.
In our opinion the Fifth Circuit completely ignored
the legislative history and legislative purposes of the
statute because the committee reports and the quotations which
we include in our brief indicate that Congress intended to
protect persons engaged in free speech activities protesting
racial discrimination.
QUESTION:

What if they had come down the street

with a combination of automobiles and a parade carrying signs

11
expressing the sentiments that you have referred to and then
stop for 20 minutes to block the traffic as part of their
demonstration to call public attention to it.

Would you think

they could be arrested for traffic violation?
MR. PARKER:

Of course, that's another case.

weren't charged with that here.

They

It would depend on the facts

of the case.
Again, I believe the same standards that apply to
regulation of first amendment conduct would apply.

Certainly

the State has an interest in regulating time and place.
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER;

Is this first amendment, then?
No, this is not first amendment.

This

is a statutory, this is a right created by Congress.
QUESTION:

I am talking about the conduct that I

just described, that's a protest, a demonstration.

Is it

protected by the first amendment?
MR. PARKER:

Well, the statute indicates that the

conduct of the persons engaged in the free speech activity
must be lawful.

So therefore, if the conduct of petitioners

in that case violated a State statute, and the State established
this by the evidence that they violated a constitutional
ordinance or State statute, then we would take the position
that removal would not be allowed

if

the prosecution was

based not on an effort to suppress free speech activity but
was based on the enforcement of a constitutionally valid

12
ordinance or State statute.
QUESTION:

What did the State claim here?

What

was the charge of the State in this case?
MR. PARKER:

Well, the State has changed its position

a couple of times.
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER;

What was the charge originally?
The initial charge was under 97-1-1,

that is, conspiracy to restrain trade or commerce.

That was

tne charge that was initially logged and then later on in
appeal they changed that.
It!s clear to us that the notion of restraining
trade and commerce is sufficiently broad to cover the free
speech activity which is protected by the Federal statute
because a civil, rights boycott which we had in this case in
which various merchants are accused of racial discrimination
in their employment practices and persons are urged not to shop
in these stores, this can be considered by the State a restraint
of trade or.commerce, that is, the customers stay out of the
store as part of the boycott.

But even though it might be

restraining trade or commerce under the State statute, it’s
protected by section 245(b) because it is free speech activity
protesting racial discrimination in private employment.
is

And that

specifically covered by this statute, by section 245(b).
The other part of the removal section that we have to

show is that petitioners are denied or cannot enforce their

13
rights, their equal civil rights in State court.
statute invoked is very specific on this.

Now, the

It prohibits whoever,

whether or not acting under color of law, and this specifically
refers to law enforcement officers, by force or threat of
force, and this refers to any threatening conduct, willfully
injures, intimidates or interferes with or attempts to injure,
intimidate, or interfere with the exercise of protected rights.
Now, of course, if these mass arrests based on the
free speech activity of the petitioners are not intimidation
or interference, I don't know what is.

So from the very

instigation of these arrests, the arrest affidavits -were
attested to by the city judge, these petitioners are denied
and they cannot enforce in State court their rights because
the statute involved here, the Federal equal civil rights
statute, provides a right as the stat\.ite did in Rachel not
even to be prosecuted for the exercise of protected activity.
It prohibits any interference, any intimidation, including
arrest and prosecution.
The removal, we contend, is based — grows out of
the Court's decision in 1966 in Georgia v. Rachel.

Georgia v.

Rachel involved title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Title II was a statutory scheme which is very close and very
closely resembles section 245(b) which we are invoking in this
case.
As I indicated the Court held that you have to rely

14

on a statute of Federal law providing for equal civil rights
stated in terms of racial equality.

The Court in

Rachel held

that title II qualified because it prohibited racial discrimina­
tion in places of public accommodation.
Similarly, the statute invoked here, section 245(b),
clearly qualifies as such a law, it clearly deals with equal
civil rights, as the Fifth Circuit itself acknowledged.

It

prohibits forcible, interference because of race with the
enumerated activities mentioned.

And it clearly provides a

right on the part of petitioners to be free of any interference
from official sources with their free speech activities protesting
racial discrimination.
The Fifth Circuit held that section 245(b) of the
criminal statute is not a law which provides for equal civil
rights.

But this holding is completely contrary to the purpose

and intent of Congress in enacting this statute.
history indicates to the contrary.

The legislative

On August 15, 1967,

Representative Madden at 113 Congressional Record 22670 said,
referring to thi.s statute, "The pending legislation will provide
the means and weapons to effectively enforce the provisions
set out guaranteeing all American citizens equal rights.
QUESTION:

Well, is 1983 then such a Federal statute?

MR. PARKER: I believe the Court in Peacock, Mr.
Justice White, rejected 1983 —
QUESTION:

Well, it gives a right to recover damages

15
from State officers if they interfere, say, with free speech
activities.
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

Yes, but we —
Let's assume in a removal case you allege

and the State says, well, that may be true that you engage
in free speech and that you are bound to win, that you are
bound to win the State criminal case by interposing a Federal
defense.

That isn't enough, is it?
MR. PARKER:

No, it's not.

The statute invoked has

to be a Federal equal rights statute specifically stated in
terms of racial equality.

And the Court in Peacock held

that tire first amendment due process clause 1983 did not
qualify as Federal laws providing for equal civil rights
stated specifically in terms of racial equality.

And this

statute passed in 19G8, we believe, fills this void.
QUESTION:

Any Federal statute, then, that said

no one will interfere with free speech where the reason for
the interference is race, purely race.
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

That would qualify.
That would qualify.
That's correct.

The civil rights removal is much narrower than the
1983 rights.

It only covers activity, free speech activity

involving racial discrimination, protesting racial discrimina­
tion.

16
QUESTION:

What right does the statute create or

provide?
MR. PARKER:

The statute provides the right to be

free of interference —
QUESTION:

The Constitution certainly provides the

protection, if the origin of the right is constitutional, I
take it, in such a statute.
MR. PARKER:

Yes, the power of Congress to enact

the legislation, I suppose, would be constitutional.

Yes.

But the first amendment does not qualify, the Court held in
Peacock, as a statute providing for rights in terms of racial
equality.

The statute has to be racial legislation from

Congress designed to protect persons protesting — engaged in
certain conduct protesting racial discrimination.

And the

statute we contend clearly qualifies in this instance.
QUESTION:

Mr. Parker, does your position depend upon

the soundness of a prediction that the rights of your clients
cannot be vindicated in the State courts?
MR. PARKER:

Mr. Justice Powell, in this case the

prediction is a certainty.

The statute invoked provides the

right not even to be prosecuted in State courts as the statute
did in Rachel.

In other words, the equal civil rights which

are provided by the statute are, include, an equal civil rights
to be free of any interference from official sources for
engaging in protected activity.

And this would include

17
prosecutions.
QUESTION: In Rachel the statute, as I recall, banned
attempts to punish in the State courts violation of State
trespass laws, and you analogize the statute here involved
to that language.
MR. PARKER:

Yes.

The statute in Rachel which was

section 203 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, has three
sections there.

Section (b) was no person shall intimidate,

threaten, or coerce any persons for the purpose of interfering
with protected rights or punish or attempt to punish any
person for exercising or attempting to exercise these
protected rights.

Of course, the intimidate, threaten, or

coerce language of title II is identical to the language indicated
in the statute.

*

It's clear also that even in this statute the
purpose of Congress was to prevent the State from punishing
persons for the exercise of protected rights, and this is
indicated by the quote from Representative Cellar at page 10
of the State's brief.

The State's quotation of extensive

legislative history is very helpful in this regard because
Representative Celler specifically said, referring to
protection against punishment, he said, "For example, the jury
would have to find that defendant's purpose was to deter
persons from voting or applying for employment or applying for
admission to a public school or to punish persons who have

18
done so."
So this legislative history reveals that part of the
purpose of Congress was to provide a right to be free of
punishment for the exercise of protected rights.
QUESTION:

Does all this turn, in your opinion, on a

factual issue as to whether or not picketing was peaceful and
lawful?
MR. PARKERs

There is a factual issue created.

The

plaintiffs do have to show that their activity was protected
activity under the statute.
QUESTION:

The plaintiffs have the burden of proof

on that factual issue.
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

Petitioners do, yes, sir.
That was the issue in the removal

proceeding.
MR. PARKER:
proceeding.

There were two issues in the removal

The first was a factual issue whether petitioners'

activity was protected, and the second one was that even if it
;

•.

.

ii -■

was protected, as a matter of law, can section 245(b) provide
a basis for removal.
Now, tine Fifth Circuit only reached the legal issue.
The Fifth Circuit only held as a matter of law that removal
cannot be provided under the statute.

We believe that that

was an error of law and is contrary to the intent of Congress
as revealed by the quotes that we have indicated in the brief.

19

Now, tiie factual issue has yet to be determined.
The two-judge court rule doesn't apply because the Fifth
Circuit didn't review the facts.
we are suggesting.

We have two alternatives

First alternative is that this Court can

make an independent examination of the record, determine
facts as in Cox v. Louisiana.

Or it can

reverse the Fifth

Circuit on the issue of law and send it back and let them
resolve the facts.
QUESTIONS

I thought the district judge in this case

found as a fact that there was unlawful picketing.
MR. PARKER:
Honor.

The district judge did so find, your

We challenged that as clearly erroneous in the Fifth

Circuit, and the Fifth Circuit did not reach that issue because
of its resolution of the legal question.

I think that anyone

reading the record would see that that finding is clearly
erroneous and that the petitioners' activities were peaceful
and protected at all times.
QUESTION:
MR, PARKER:

Do you view that as an issue before us?
Yes, I do.

It can be resolved either

by this Court or by the Fifth Circuit on remand.

The Court

does not have to resolve the factual issue if it rules for us
on the legal issue.

It can simply remand the case back to

the Fifth Circuit for resolution of the legal question — of
the factual question, I'm sorry.
QUESTION:

Do we ordinarily deal with factual issues

20

not resolved in the court of appeals?
MR. PARKER;

The Court did in Cox v. Louisiana.

course, this was an appeal from a State supreme court.

Of

But

this is an unusual instance in which the court of appeals did
not rule on our factual contentions, simply felt it was
unnecessary because of their view of the law.

I think that a

fair reading of the record will indicate that the district
court’s determinations in this regard were clearly erroneous.
QUESTION:

Can you suggest any case in which we have

reviewed a factual issue that the court of appeals has not
reviewed?
MR. PARKER:
cite in our brief.

There are two criminal cases that we

We discussed this question in our brief at

page 40 and we referred specifically to United States v. Brims
and Cole v. Ralph at page 43 of our brief.
The Fifth Circuit seemed to take the view, and we
only suggest this to the Court, the Fifth Circuit seemed to take
the view that petitioners' activity was protected because it
starts its opinion by saying, "No one questions the right of
petitioners to engage in picketing and free speech activities,"
So that implies to us that the Fifth Circuit believed that
the petitioners’ activity was protected and therefore was
required to rule on the legal issue.

And we think a fair

reading of the record will support that contention.

If the

Court believes if there is any conflict in this regard, it can

21

resolve the legal issue and send it back fco the Fifth Circuit
for a factual determination.
This was certainly the procedure followed in Rachel.
In Rachel there was no evidentiary hearing, but the Court
sustained the allegations of the removal petition in Rachel
and sent the case back to the lower court for an evidentiary
hearing on petitioners' allegation.
I would like to reserve the remainder of my time for
rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Parker.

Mr. Noble.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ED DAVIS NOBLE, JR.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. NOBLE:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I would first like to address myself to some of the

facts brought out by counsel opposite.
While it is quite true that we admitted in our brief
that there v;as at one time or another activities which might
border on free speech, that was not. why these individuals were
charged.

They were charged for other activities, not for

free speech, at one time or another.
Next, it was brought out that they were charged
initially under 97-1-1 of the Mississippi Code of 1972.

That

is true, but while on remand by the district court and before
the appeal was perfected, the grand jury of Warren County,

22

Mississippi, met in session on March 12, 1973, and charged
these individuals under 97-23-83 and 97-23-85 which specifically
address themselves to secondary boycott activities and threats
or force in the use of affecting normal and lawful business
activities.
This is clearly a case of interpretation of Rachel
and Peacock, may it

please the Court, and'in that sense it is

interesting to note that the individuals rely on 18 U.8.C. 245
subsection (b).

In doing so throughout their brief they

cannot cite a particular case, either in the circuit court
of appeals

or in the district court, which in and of themselves

affect removal that is triggered under 1443(1).
is correct.

Wa think that

It cannot be analogized with 1443(1)9s requirements

because it is not a civil statute, it is a criminal statute.
It protects, it does not provide.

And in that protection, it

actually protects rights which have already been granted either
by statute of the United States or the Constitution of the
United States.

This is clearly brought out, may it please

the Court, in the congressional history of this particular
statute, first, by the House of Representatives in the
initial statement which we allude to in our brief by
Congressman Celler.

He speaks of four objectives, first, that

it protects individuals in the sense of force or interference
in civil rights, that is for itself; secondly, that it spells
out those particular activities which would be protected by

23

this criminal statute; thirdly, it brings individuals who
are participating in activities within the protection of the
criminal nature of this statute; and* fifth and more
importantly, twice in this statute it spells out the penalties
which are assessed if it is found by a jury that an individual
’

.t

}

has been participating in these activities.
It is quite true, as counsel opposite has said,that
a jury must find, but we think that that is in the criminal
nature of itself and not in a civil nature.
The Senate in the majority report, 791, specifically
states that it is to protect the individuals against acts of
violence.

There is no indication that this particular statute

is for the ongoings of criminal processes of the State.

And,

of course, individuals should be acting lawfully, which these
individuals were not.
The language of the statute itself is clear.
codified in the U.S. Code as a criminal statute.

It is

It begins

in section (a) by speaking that it does not in and of itself
cut loose the State processes which might be charged under
this particular statute and that no charges, no charges, shall
be brought under this statute by the Attorney General, by the
Department of Justice without first the written permission
of the Attorney General of the United States or its deputy
and a conclusion that that particular charge is in the public
interest.

24
18 U.S.C. 245 is criminal.

Therefore, it does not

has two prerequisites.

Rachel

First, that the statute must provide

for equal civil rights stated in terms of racial equality?
and, secondly, that it must be proven and clearly predicted
that that particular right will be denied or can be denied in
the State court.

Like we said, in the first instance this is
V
a criminal statute which provides protectioni It does not
provide new rights.

245(b) spells out the specific instances,

ten in fact, which are protected by this statute.

Therefore,

it does not come within the 1866 model as this Court projected
in Rachel in the decision by Mr. Justice Stewart.

In the 1866

model it granted and therefore guaranteed new rights to
citizens of the United States.
There has been some argument about whether or not
this particular statute grants or removal protects the rights
of one who is engaged in first amendment or fourteenth
amendment rights, such as picketing.

If this Court were to

decide this, it would seem to be cutting back or reversing
the dictates of Rachel and Peacock in particular for in those
two cases when read together this Court decided in 1966 that
the broad panoply of first amendment rights and fourteenth
amendment rights are not protected by removal.
As I mentioned previously, this appeal is now
constituted of six individuals who are now under indictment by

25

the Warren County grand jury in Warren County, Mississippi.
They are charged with criminal conspiracy in effecting a
secondary boycott and they are charged with use of force and
intimidation to effect that end.
QUESTION:

Of course, that doesn't appear on the face

of the charge or whatever pieces of paper instituted these
proceedings in the State court.

Where do you — I gather the

district court and the court of appeals have accepted your
version of the charge.
MR. NOBLE:

They did.

Yes, Mr. Justice White, they

did.
QUESTION:
court?

But how did you get that across to the

It doesn’t appear at all.
MR. NOBLE:

It was explained in oral argument by

questions put to us where the posture of the case stood at
that particular time, and it came out in oral argument to the
1

Fifth Circuit.
QUESTION:

j

*'■

So you were charging these people with

the use of threats and coercion.
MR. NOBLE:

Yes, sir.

two of the six actually.

As a matter of fact, only

Four are charged with criminal

conspiracy and secondary boycott, and two, it is my under­
standing by conversations with the district attorney, since
we did not handle, my office does not handle ~~
QUESTION:

You are representing the State here.

26

MR. NOBLE;

But two are charged under the force and

effect statute, that is, 97-23-83, and four are charged with the
secondary boycott statute 97-23-85.
QUESTION;

Let us suppose that on the removal hearing,

I gather you think that a removal hearing in the district court
is a proper thing.
MR. NOBLE;
QUESTION:
seeking to

A removal hearing was h^d, sir.
Yes.

Well, suppose there that the people

remove claim and demonstrate, at least according

to them, that you arrested them for peacefully protesting
certain conduct, and suppose the charge says force and
violence, the use of force and violence.

But the State then

comes back and says, "Well, I guess we really are just
charging them with peaceful picketing."

Would that case then

be removable?
MR. NOBLE:
QUESTION;
MR. NOBLE:

No, sir, it would not.
Why not?
Well, under Rachel and Peacock in its

interpretation of 1443(1), first amendment rights in and of
themselves are not removable.

You must look to the charges

against the individuals.
QUESTION:

Let's assume that it's alleged that the

people were arrested solely because of their race, T-eacefully
protesting activities and they were arrested because of their
race.

27
MR. NOBLE:

I still do not think under Rachel and

Peacock that this particular instance of picketing would in and
of itself constitute removal, no, sir, for this reason:

It

requires two things for removal according to Rachel's precepts,
that you prove a specific civil rights stated in terms of
racial equality, and secondly, that those particular rights
would be denied in the State courts of Georgia and Mississippi.
In this particular instance, the State of Mississippi has no
particular statute which denies one the right to picket, nor
does the City of Vicksburg -- as is shown in the evidence of
the case by testimony by Chief Brown — nor does the City of
Vicksburg have any ordinance which denies one the right to
peacefully picket.

Therefore, they would come under and

satisfy this particular right through an appeal to the State
court.
QUESTION:

You would say any time you charge somebody

on the face of a complaint with some act that was obviously
within the State police power, it could never be removable,
even though predictably the defendant might win in the State
court.
MR. NOBLE:
true, sir.

According to Rachel and Peacock that’s
v

QUESTION:

Well, in Rachel the charge was trespass,

wasn’t it?
MR. NOBLE:

Mr. Justice Stewart, that is true.

28

However, you had a conflict with a State statute, Federal and
State statutes, shortly before you decided Rachel,
QUESTION:

Hamm had been decided.

MR. NOBLE:

Hamm had been decided, there interpreting

2008(c) which said that public accommodations granted a
specific right, therefore it substituted a right for a crime.
Here there is no substitution for, even given 245.

It

substitutes no right to participate in the crime charged by
the State of Mississippi against these individuals.

So removal

is not effective.
In conclusion, I would like to say, or I would like
to paraphrase, if I might, Peacock, that this case differs
from what is alleged in the petition in this wise:

There is

no Federal statute, in particular 245(b), for any statute on
the books which gives these individuals the right to participate
in a secondary boycott or to intimidate one in the normal
course of business activities, nor is there any statute which
has been cited to replace ~ to allude to the question by
Mr. Justice Stewart —
QUESTION:

What was the secondary boycott in this

case?
MR. NOBLE:

What was it?

Mr. Justice Marshall, it

was brought out that these people were engaged in a conspiracy
to stop individuals from participating in ongoing business
%

activities with certain individuals in the city of Vicksburg.

29

QUESTION:

And that's secondary boycott.

MR. NOBLE:

According to the State statute, it is.

Not in the sense of telling someone to do it, but they were
using activities to engage in a secondary boycott, that's
right.
QUESTION:

They just urged people, "Don't patronise

this store"?
MR. NOBLE:

No, sir, I don't think that was the

charge.
QUESTION:
with, do we?

We don't know what they were charged

Do you?

MR. NOBLE:
QUESTION:
MR. NOBLE:

Well, —
Do you know what they were charged with?
With all due respect to you, Mr. Justice

Marshall, I can only represent to you what the indictment
says.

They are charged with secondary boycott and intimidation

of the individuals and patrons going into these particular
stores.

Those were the two charges logged against them.
QUESTION:
MR. NOBLE:
QUESTION:

That's all we know.
That's right.
You are necessarily saying, then, that

the Federal statute would be no defense to those charges.
MR. NOBLE;

Absolutely, Mr. Justice White.

4

QUESTION:

And that if they were convicted, the people

who convicted them couldn't be indicted under the Federal

30

statute for having interfered with these activities»
MR. NOBLE;

The statute speaks — the Federal

statute which they allude to, 245(b), specifically refers to
force or threats of force in the following activities, and if
they do so, and if you go to the bottom of the statute, then
they may be fined or there is imprisonment involved.
QUESTION;

How about the policeman's threat to take

the man to jail, couldn't that qualify as a threat of force
under the Federal statute?
QUESTION;

To be put in jail or arrested is pretty

forceful, isn't it?
MR. NOBLE;

I wouldn't think that that would be,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
force involved here.

It would be a threat, but there was no
The only thing that was effective here

in the city of Vicksburg was the ongoing criminal processes.
QUESTION;

Even if they could be convicted, and

maybe they couldn't -- I am depending, of course, on what the
actual facts might be ■— that's not enough to justify removal
as was pointed out in Peacock.
MR. NOBLE;
QUESTION;

No, sir.
That was one of the remedies, was the

Federal criminal law as well as the Federal civil law.
MR. NOBLE;

That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.

They have several remedies which they may take advantage of
which you spoke to in your opinion, that is, injunctive

31
process, habeas, perhaps damages.
QUESTION!

And perhaps a criminal prosecution.

MR. NOBLE;

Right.

Criminal prosecution, and of

throughout the State system to this Court itself.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Noble.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Parker?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK.R. PARKER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PARKER:
please the Court:
on 142 and 143.

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice/ and may it

First of all, the indictment is contained
There is the boiler plate language "with force

and arms," but that's not part of the factual recitation in
the indictment.

The indictment simply charges them with

promoting and encouraging unlav/ful boycott so as to prevent
black persons from trading or doing business.

But the testimony

of Police Chief Marion R. Brown indicates that his notion

of

preventing black people from doing business is telling them that
there’s a boycott on.
For example, page 126 of the appendix, why was John
Ferguson arrested?

He was actually participating in the

boycott, and in fact at the beginning was very actively
participating in it.

That's the Chief of Police.

"The only

thing I’ve seen him, I've seen him actually carry a picket
sign, I've seen him stopping people on the street and talking
to them."

That's protected activity under the statute.

That,

32
according to the Police Chief was the basis for the arrest
in this case.

The same with the other petitioners, and the

evidence is in the appendix.
Now, the State maintains that a criminal statute,
a Federal criminal statute providing for equal civil rights
cannot be a statute providing for equal civil rights under
1443 because it's a criminal statute, it doesn't compare with
the 1966 model.

The 1866 model, the original removal petition

statute, was a criminal statute.
criminal penalties.

In section 2 it provided

It was re-enacted in 1870 as a removal

statute and providing criminal penalties.
was a criminal statute.

The model 1866

A criminal statute can provide for

equal civil rights.
Now, it is contended that the Fifth Circuit did not
accept petitioners' version of the facts.

This is not true.

The Fifth Circuit did not resolve the factual conflict.

The

Fifth Circuit did not accept respondents' version of the
facts.

The Fifth Circuit did not reach the factual question

at all.
QUESTIONS

Let's assume that the indictment or the

charge was that someone killed somebody or broke into some
store, broke into a store in the course of a demonstration.
Assume that's the charge.

Now, there is no conflict on its

face between that charge and the Federal statute.
MR. PARKER;

That's correct.

33

QUESTION:

But would you say it's nevertheless

removable ?
MR» PARKER:

If the facts show that the charge is

spurious.
QUESTION:

So you would say that any time at a hearing

you can show that this is a completely fraudulent prosecution?
that it should be removed?
MR, PARKER:

That's right? if the prosecution is

fraudulent —
QUESTION:
MR, PARKER:

You don't think that's contrary to Peacock?
No» it's not contrary to Peacock at all.

This is discussed extensively by Chief Judge Tuttle of the
Fifth Circuit in the Walker case? which is cited in the brief.
The statute in Rachel was not unconstitutional on its face?
and the charges were not unconstitutional on its face.

The

charge was trespass? and trespass under Georgia law is refusal
to leave the premises when requested to do so by the manager.
There is no indication of Rachel motivation in the charges.
And it was only when the petitioners could prove that they were
asked to leave for racial reasons that this racial motivation
behind the charge, that they could succeed.
here.

The same thing

The evidence shows that there was racial motivation

behind these charges, that the sole and exclusive purpose of
these charges was to suppress a boycott? suppress free speech
activity protesting racial discrimination.

Now? the statute

34

here does substitute a Federal right for a State crime.

If

a boycott, as the State maintains, is criminal under State
law, and if it's criminal to urge people not to shop at these
stores because of their racially discriminatory hiring
policies, then that directly conflicts with the Federal right
under this statute because the right protects any free speech
activity protesting racial discrimination.

The boycott was

free speech activity protesting racial discrimination, is
covered by the statute, and the statute therefore clearly and
directly substitutes a Federal right for a State crime.
QUESTION:

It is equally true, isn't it, about the

civil statutes, the civil rights statutes, going back to the
Reconstruction days?
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

What is equally true?
What you have said about this criminal

statute is equally true about the Federal civil statutes.
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

Yes.
And yet we held, the Court held, did it

not, in the City of Greenwood case that that wasn't enough
to protect the right.
MR. PARKER:

The statute had to confer the right.
Well, the Court in Peacock, I believe

the ruling, the holding of the Court was that those statutes
invoked were not specifically statutes which stated in terms
of racial equality.
QUESTION:

But some of the statutes were.

35
MS. PARKER:

Yes, but those statutes, 1981 and 1971,

were not statutes that specifically protected the conduct and
activity of the petitioners.

Petitioners were engaged in voter

registration activity, and that was not specifically protected
by either 1981 or 1971.

It wasn't until Congress passed this

statute, section 245(b), that this free speech activity
protesting racial discrimination was specifically covered by
Federal law providing for equal civil rights.
QUESTION:

Pursuing Mr. Justice White's question to

you, is it possible that the removal hearing might turn into a
miniature trial of the criminal charges to determine in the
murder case or the break-in, the housebreaking, in order to
determine the issues?
MR. PARKER:

Well, an evidentiary hearing is required

by Rachel, and the Court indicated that the plaintiffs —
petitioners -- did have an opportunity to prove that they were
asked to leave the restaurant for racial reasons.
Now, the State probably would not have to prove that
they were guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, but certainly I
think — and the Fifth Circuit decisions sustain this — that
the State would have to establish the elements of a crime, in
other words, the State, once petitioners have shown or proven
that they were engaged in protected activities —
QUESTION:

The State would have to prove a prima

facie case at the removal hearing.

36
MR. PARKER:

That is correct.

They would have to

establish the elements of the offense, that the petitioners
were not arrested for protected activity, but they were
arrested for unprotected activity.

Our defense is that the

State hasn't met that burden in this case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Parker, in responding to Mr. Justice

White, you stated, if I understood you, that if a defendant
could show that the charges were fraudulent or brought in bad
faith, that he would be entitled to removal; if showings could
be made,he also would be entitled to an injunction, Younger
would not preclude it, would it?
MR. PARKER:

That’s correct, Mr. Justice, under

certain circumstances he would.

The civil rights removal

statute is a narrower statute and applies only in cases of
Federal equal rights statutes providing for specific rights
in terms of racial equality.
a coordinate remedy.

The injunctive relief would be

But it's our contention that this

coordinate remedy should not preempt the removal jurisdiction,
that removal jurisdiction should be allowed where it applies.
At least the remedies were passed at approximately the same
time.
QUESTION:

You are saying you would have alternative

remedies.
MR. PARKER:

Well, the Court certainly in Peacock

held that there were alternative remedies where first amendment

37

rights, for example, were alleged to be violated.

But our

contention here is that if removal applies, if Rachel applies
in this particular circumstance , that removal should be
allowed because section 245(b) is a Federal statute providing
for equal civil rights and does provide a right to the
petitioners

not even to be prosecuted in State court, provides

the right to be free of any kind of interference from official
sources with the exercise of protected rights.
Now, of course, we did file a 1983 action also in
this case, but we were unable to get a temporary injunction
which would have held the prosecution to a status quo.

So the

1983 remedy was unavailing in this case.
QUESTION s
MR. PARKER:

Unavailing.
Unavailing.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:56 a.m. the oral argument in the
above-entitled matter was concluded.)
