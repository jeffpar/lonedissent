ORAL ARGUMENT OF VICTOR S. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit which applied the
Act of State Doctrine to hold the Petitioner, Alfred Dunhill
of London, could not obtain an affirmative judgment against
the Republic of Cuba awarded by the District Court.
Certiorari was granted by this Court with respect
to two issues.
The first issue was whether the statement of
counsel made at the trial can constitute an Act of State.
As to that issue, we contend that there is nothing In the
record that in any way evidences a sovereign act by the
Republic of Cuba.
All that the record shows in this respect are
statements by counsel for the Republic of Cuba indicating a
litigating position in the case.
The second issue on which certiorari was granted

4
sui sponte by this Court was whether, assuming the Act of
State Doctrine applies in this case, whether the affirmative
judgment nevertheless should be reinstated under the counter­
claim exception set forth in First National City Bank
against Banco Nacional de Cuba.
As to that issue, we contend that under the total­
ity of the circumstances in this case where Cuba has put into
issue in a single proceeding far more than the amount of the
counterclaims awarded against it and where all of the claims
and counterclaims arise out of a series of related trans­
actions put into issue by Cuba in our courts, that that
counterclaim exception should apply.
Because of the position taken by Respondents’
counsel in their brief in this Court, the position being
that the record does not justify the phrasing of the ques­
tions as granted in the petition for certiorari, I think it
important that the background of this litigation be set
forth at some length so that we can understand precisely
what is in the record and the significance of the questions
as framed by the Court.
Litigation arose out of the action in September,
I960 of the Republic of Cuba in nationalizing certain cigar
factories in Cuba.

That action was termed an intervention,

a euphemism and for that reason, the Cuban Government and its
representatives in this case are often referred to as

5
interventors.
The persons whose factories were seized are very
often referred to as the owners.
For a long time prior to the intervention,
Dunhill, as well as other employers, had purchased cigars
from the owners.

Indeed, for a short period after the

intervention the importers, again including Dunhill,
continued to purchase cigars from Cuba and during the
immediate post-intervention period, continued to make pay­
ments for shipments of cigars that had been shipped prior
to the Intervention.
T.ie owners, of course, immediately after the
intervention, fled Cuba, some of them coming here to the
United States.
In early 1961, the owners instituted nine actions
in the southern district of New York.
against Dunhill.

Four of them were

By these actions, the owners, in essence,

sought to obtain payments for cigars shipped both before
and after the intervention.
Shortly thereafter, the interventors brought
their o\m action, not against the importers, but against the
owners’ counsel in an action entitled Palicio against Brush
and Bloch.
By that action, the interventors, In essence,
sought to claim the right to sue for the same matters on

6
which the owners had already instituted suit.
Since the importers were essentially in the posi­
tion of stakeholder in these actions, the District Court
stayed the actions against them and proceeded to resolve the
threshold and significant disputes between the owners and
the interventors regarding who was entitled to payment for
what cigars.
Insofar as relevance here, the District Court,
per Judge Bryant, in 1966, in a decision that was later
affirmed per curiam by the Second Circuit, held that the
interventors were entitled to sue for the post-intervention
shipment.
In essence, the court held that, at least xirith
respect to Cuban assets, under the ruling of this Court in
Sabbatino and the Act of State Doctrine set forth there, the
nationalization decree of i960 was effective as to the
seized Cuban assets.
At this point in time, however, the significant ™
and we are talking now about 1967 — the interventors sti­
pulated before the District Court that the owners were
entitled to recover for preintervention shipments the
assumption by both the owners and the interventors, some
seven years after the event being that these amounts were
too insignificant to concern themselves with.
After the rulings in Palicio against Brush and

7
Bloch, the interventors were allowed to intervene at this
time in the procedural sense in the nonactions in New York.
The actions were, in fact, consolidated for trial,
were tried together and appealed together in the Second
Circuit.
During the course of trial preparation, however,
and the course of the trial itself, it developed that, as
of the date of the intervention there had been almost
$500,000 in unpaid amounts for cigars shipped prior to the
intervention, hardly an "insignificant sum” as had been
thought by both the owners and the interventors when they
entered into the stipulation in 1967.
It further developed during the course of these
proceedings that the importers, shortly after the inter­
vention had, in fact, paid all of those sums in accordance
with their longstanding practice of paying on 30, 60 or
90-day terms.
At that point, Cuba, of course, changed its
position and sought to back off from its stipulation that it
had entered into in Pallclo against Brush and Bloch.
They contended now that they should be entitled to
the preintervention shipments as well and not only that,
they contended that they never received those payments if,
in fact, they had been made.
The District Court, however, found that not only

8
had the payments been made by the importers, but that Cuba,
in fact, had received them.
In the case of Dunhill, those payments amounted to
some $55*000 more than the District Court found Dunhill still
owed Cuba for the post-intervention shipments.
In the case of the importers as a group, however,
the situation was reversed because far more was still owed
to the interventors or the importers as a group for postintervention shipment than the District Court found had been
paid to Cuba for the preintervention shipments.
Judge Bryan ruled that the oxtfners were entitled to
payment for the preintervention shipments.

He also ruled

that the interventors had received those payments and vrere
liable under an unjust enrichment theory to return them to
the importer.
In his initial decision, he allowed the importers
to set off against what they owed for the post-intervention
shipments, the amount; that they had paid for the preIntervention shipments.
He specifically ruled the Act of State Doctrine
inapplicable to the payments received by Cuba, stating in
part — and I am quoting this portion of an opinion now:
"Here, all that occurred was a statement by counsel
for the interventors during trial that the Cuban Government
and the interventors denied liability and had refused to

9
make repayment."
This statement was made after the interventors
had invoked the jurisdiction of this Court in order to
pursue their claims against the importers for post-inter­
vention shipment.
It is hard to conceive how, if such a statement
can be elevated to the status of an Act of State, any
refusal by any state to honor any obligation at any time
could be considered anything else.
I should note parenthetically at this point that
it was apparent that the set-off procedure described by
Judge Bryan in his initial opinion obviously did not take
account of the Dunhill situation.
Accordingly, after the decision was rendered, we
moved for an affirmative judgment against the interventors.
Despite the claim at trial of an Act of State, the Inter­
ventors expressed no opposition to this and, there being no
opposition, that motion was granted.
The Second Circuit, of course, affirmed Judge
Bryan's decision in all respects except one.

It reversed

the affirmative judgment in favor of Dunhill on the ground
of the Act of State Doctrine.
It found the Act of State in Cuba’s failure to
honor the importer’s demand for return of the payments and
I am quoting now, "Confirmed by the

Cuban Government’s

10
counsel at trial."
In shorts regardless of what the Court of Appeals'
language was, there is no question that on the record the
only conceivable evidence of any Act of State by the Cuban
Government was simply the statements by counsel for the
Cuban Government that its client would not honor a claim for
return of the funds.
The effect of the Court of Appeals ruling, of
course, is to force Dunhill to pay twice for the same cigars.
Having already paid the interventors under the court's
ruling, they must now pay the owners with interest.
We submit, therefore, that despite the statements
in Respondents' brief to the contrary, the first issue is
properly before this

Court.

That is, whether statements of counsel can
constitute an Act of State and we submit as well for the
reasons set forth in our brief that they cannot.
QUESTION:

Is the Court of Appeals opinion

reproduced in any of the papers vie have?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes, that is in the Joint Appendix,

Mr. Justice Stewart.
QUESTION:

I have an Appendix.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

And there is a Joint Appendix as

well.
QUESTION:

Oh, I don't have that.

11
MR. FRIEDMAN:

The page on which the quote from

the Court of Appeals that I read Is on 25-A of the Joint
Appendix.
QUESTION:

Is there really any doubt as to the

fact that Cuba has repudiated the debts?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes, your Honor, I would say there

is.
QUESTION:

Have they paid any of them to anybody-

in this country since Castro took power?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
special circumstance.

Well, your Honor, this is a rather
I think we must recognize that in

all other instances where Cuba has been before this or any
other court, they have appeared armed with a decree which
states certain consequences, usually confiscation of
property.
We have a situation in this case, however, where
up until the last year, not only has Cuba certainly not
issued any decree with respect to these funds, but has been
actively contending in our courts that they never received
them.
Mow, it seems to me that it is a far cry from
stating that we have funds and we hereby seize them, to say,
in the other instance, that we are coming into your courts
to try to collect those funds and then when the proof comes
out that they already have them, to deny receipt of the

funds.
That is not a seizure and I would respectfully
suggest that the situation is far different and that there is
a real debt.
Yes, sir?
QUESTION:

The Second Circuit, as I read the

opinion, found an Act of State in view of all of the circum­
stances and said that a formal declaration was not necessary
, ->V5*

and you differ from that?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, I do not.

Clearly, there are circumstances where some act,
some public, sovereign act of the state may be proved by
other than a formal decree.

There are a number of cases.

Most of them occur in time of civil strife or rebellion
where a military officer, for example, goes in and seizes
property.

That is not a formal act.
But every case which has decided the Act of State

Doctrine has insisted that there be some public affirmative
act, something that one can look at and say, this is the
affirmative act of the sovereign, something where the
sovereign is acting so that if this Court or any court in
this country were to take a contrary position, it could be
considered an affront to the sovereignty of that nation.
QUESTION:

Well, then, is it not also an act which

takes place within the jurisdiction of that sovereign and

13
then, in turn, is asserted in our courts?
MR, FRIEDMAN:

That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice

and not only that, in every case which has dealt with the
doctrine our courts have required proof in our courts of
the fact of that act in the foreign jurisdiction, that is
correct.
QUESTION:

Was that true in Pons against Cuba,

do you recall?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

Pons?

P-O-N-S against Cuba -— was there an

official act claim?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I’m sorry, I am not familiar with

that case, sir.
QUESTION:

Well, it’s unimportant.

I can track

that down.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Respondents appear to concede in

their brief — and I am not sure it is a concession — but
they do appear to concede that statements of counsel in
fact cannot constitute an Act of State and I refer the
Court to page 12 of Respondents’ brief in that respect.
They seek to avoid the issue by, in effect,
asserting that counsel was simply the agency by which Cuba
made known its legal position.

We suggest that this simply

does not square with the cases and as I have said, every
case which has thus far considered the application of this

doctrine has insisted that there be some affirmative act of
the foreign sovereign, as the Chief Justice has pointed out,
within its own territory and then as a second requirement,
that there be competent proof of the existence of that act
within our courts.
Here, for all the counsel has said, we still do
not know what the Act was.

We do not know when it took

place or how it took place or who was responsible for it.
In this connection, we cited the case of The
Navemar which, albeit a case dealing with sovereign immunity,
I think is instructive in terms of the standards of at least
minimal proof required when a sovereign comes into our
courts and asserts a claim that it should be treated
differently from private litigates and in The Navemar there
■:

- i

was a verified statement by the Ambassador of Spain that
his government had, in fact, seized possession and ownership
of a liable vessel. There being some question about those
facts, the court refused to foreclose these issues but,
instead, invited the Ambassador to intervene in the action
and prosecute his claims as a litigant in the suit.
I suggest, moreover, that in addition to the fact
that the Act of State application here was far broader than
in any of the decided cases, that there are no policy
reasons underlying the Act of State Doctrine itfhich would
require any less proof than we are contending for.

15
The Doctrine itself, as the Respondents concede,
of necessity works in unfairness as to any litigant against
whom the doctrine is applied.

It denies him his judicial

remedies.
True, if the courts are attempting to deal with a
public act or pronouncement of a foreign government ,
certainly there may be a realistic danger that the courts
either may be involved in political controvery in inter­
national affairs or may be usurping executive prerogatives
in those affairs.
But surely, where there is no public act of a
foreign sovereign, we submit that those dangers are un­
realistic and that to apply the doctrine to create the
unfairness, unless there is a realistic basis in fact on
which the courts can operate simply does not make sense.
And we submit that that requires nothing less
than competent evidence at the trial that an affirmative
act of a foreign sovereign has, in fact, occurred and here,
as we know, nothing of the sort has occurred.
I reviewed the history of the case at some length
because I wanted to show that, for some ten years, Cuba
apparently was either unaware or, at the very least,
disputed the receipt of the very monies counsel for Cuba
now says it has seized at some time that we don't know and
in some manner which we also don't know.

16
There Is a suggestion

In Respondents’ brief that

I feel should be discussed briefly,
At page 17, Respondents appear to argue that the
nationalization decree of I960 might be the Act of State
which justifies the retention of Petitioner's payments.
The argument appears to be that since that decree
nationalized the accounts receivable of the owners, that
payments on those accounts, at least insofar as they reach
Cuba, may also have been taken under the authority of that
decree.
Both courts below, of course, held — under the
Republic of Iraqui case that the decree was ineffective to
reach those accounts receivable because they were asset»
located outside of the jurisdiction of Cuba being payable
in New York.
We believe that ruling was correct but we do want
to point out that if this is Respondent’s position now, and
if that were to be adopted, we must note to the extent that
the court should rule in that fashion, the rulings of the
court below with respect to parties not now before it would
also be effective because if the court were to rule that the
decree somehow operates with respect to the accounts
receivable insofar as payments on those accounts reach Cuba,
then we would submit that the — that such a ruling would, in
effect, extinguish the accounts receivable themselves and

17
the owners' judgment against Dunhill to that efi’ect
ivould also be extinguished.
I turn now to the second argument -«• or the
second branch of the argument which assumes that the court
finds that the Act of State Doctrine is effective here and
the

questicn is, assuming that effect, is this case within

the counter cl aim exception created by Clt;> Pant in view of
the fact that Petitioner's counterclaim here does not exceed
the net balance owed to Cuba by all of the other importers
who were consolidated for trial in this case.
We submit that in view of the totality of
circumstances of this case that the counterclaim exception,
should, in fact, be applied.
In fact, we believe that the circumstances here
«re far stronger for justifying the application of that

doctrine than they were in City Bank.
In City dank, of course, there were many
differences of views among the Justices but we think that
tiro threads run through the various opinions.
I have already alluded to them In my argument on
the first point.

They are that the Act of State Doctrine

Really serves two fundamental purposes.
One is involved with not having this Court enter
into areas which are more properly reserved for the Executive.
The other is that this Court should not be involved in

13
deciding issues which may affect our foreign relations.
I do not

and I am thankful I do not for

purposes of this case, have to get into the question as to
which of those is the more important because I think under
either view, it Is quite clear that allowing the counter­
claim here to the extent of all of the judgments In favor
of Cuba would not violate either of those principles.
You must recall that this case, like any other
that we have found, involves Cuba's coming into our courts
arid affirmatively seeking relief on the questi on of who was
f

entitled to the payment of all of the cigars?
Initially they 'came in and asked for payments of
all.

They then retreated when they found that there were

significant, amounts due on the pre-intervention shipments.

became clear that they might lose oh .some of those issues
they retreated into an Act of State defense to the assertion
of a: judgment,,.
Cuba has never in this case said that anjihing
they have done with respect to those accounts receivable
and the amounts payable on the cigars should not be treated
by these courts as a judicial issue.
In fact, Cuba has submitted these very issues

19
to the court.
The only reason the Act of State Doctrine has been
asserted here is because on some of those issues, Cuba
seemed to have been coming out a loser
QUESTION:

That we --

yes?

What has our State Department had to

say about this case?
MR» FRIEDMAN:

So far as I know, nothing,

Mr, Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

Is it not usual that our State

Department does take a position or at. least advises the
court that they have no position?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

My understanding, sir, is that they

will do that if any party or the court requests it.
We did not feel it was appropriate to request it
i\
in this instance because we did not believe there was any
proof whatsoever that an Act of State had occurred.
QUESTION:

Well, wherever it has been thought, at

least in my observation in cases of this kind for 18, 20
years — wherever the State Department has thought any
relati ms betx^een the two countries would be adversely
affected, they didn't wait for anybody to ask.

They

affirmatively told the Attorney General what was the position
of the State Department.
MR, FRIEDMAN:

Well, I am perfectly prepared to

accept that, Mr. Chief Justice.

In addition, I might point

20

oiit

that I believe that the Stevenson letter, which goes
Hr*

beyond the City Bank case, but also talks about like cases
would, I believe, be applicable here.
If anything, this case presents certainly far less
rationale for an abstention by the judiciary than First
National City Bank did.

after all, in First national City

Bank, the effect of this Court's ruling was to have the
District Court's or the Court of Appeals actually rule on
the legality of the seizure by the Castro Government of
First national City's Cuban Bpnk»
Here, we have nothing of the sort.
legal issues have already been decided.

All of the

The factual issues

have already been decided.
The only thing at issue here is the entry of the
judgment.

We do not have a situation where this Court is

being asked, as against an act of state contention, to rule
on matters which may involve some kind of sensitive foreign
relations possibilities.
I might also point out that it appears that
Mr. Rabinowitz has been in contact with the State Department,
although «•» in the Appendix to his brief with regard to the
Office of Foreign Assets — I'm sorry, that's the Treasury
Department.

So the Executive Branch is obviously aware of

the case.
I would conclude simply by saying that we have

21
cited in our brief a number of instances where both the
executive and legislative trend, it seems to us, are
distinctly going towards looking at disfavor with any
expansion of either the Act of State Doctrine or the
Doctrine of Sovereign Immunity.
We think that this case, to the extent that the
Court of Appeals held that there was an Act of State
Doctrine applicable, clearly i3 such an expansion and we
see no reason i%Thy the courts, in the face of a decided
legislative and executive trend to the contrary, should get
involved in expanding the Act of State Doctrine.
QUEST I ON:

Might I ask you just one questi on?

Suppose there were no act of State Doctrine involved in the
case and it came out as it did with owing money — debts
due on either side -- how about Dunhill being able to
collect the excess of what Cuba — was it from the other --from the other judgments — from the other assets available
in the case?
Did you say they were consolidated for trial?
MR® FRIEDMAN: : That is correct.
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Now, under yoxir procedure would it be

technically a set-off?

Let's assume Dunhill had judgment

against Cuba for this -- what is it, ^80,000 or «plOO -»
whatever it is -- had that judgment and it wanted it
satisfied.

Would it be technically a set-off in that case?

22
MR, FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

No, I believe it would not be.

So you v.'ould have to utilize other

procedures available?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That is correct.

We ~would have to

attach the judgment.
QUESTION:

You would have to attach the judgment?

MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

But the assets are there before the

Court?
MR, BEIEDMAN:

That is correct.

That is correct.

But let me point out -QUESTION:

But would It be really

for purposes

of — for our purposes, i's it really any different than if
you found that you had this judgment and you found a bank
account somewhere?
MR, FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

I believe it is.

I believe it is.

Now, that i3 what I want to know.

Why

is it?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
procedural ground,

All right.

Not on a technical or

My point simply Is that Cuba has put

into issue, in a single, litigating mode, all of these claims
and counterclaims and what I am suggesting is that the
rationale for allowing a complete set-off or counterclaim
within this framework regardless of the precise form that it
took is far stronger than was present in City Bank.

23

There are no -- to my way of thinking, there are no justi­
fications which underlie the application of the Act of State
Doctrine which in any way should preclude that result,
whereas, in City B&nk, there very definitely were different
policy consideraticns which could have led the Court to the
other result.
So I am not relying on the technicality of whether
or not these were consolidated for trial or consolidated
action.

1 do not think that New York procedural niceties

should control the ruling of this Court in that respect.
QUESTION:

Would it be your position -- I am not

sure that you need to go so far -- but is it ycur position
that ’Whenever a foreign sovereign comes into our courts he
must come in on our terms and have the cases cited by
traditional principles of law applicable to American
litigants?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, I am afraid if I answer that

question yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I have eliminated the Act
of State Doctrine and -QUESTI CM:

You don’t think you need to eliminate

it entirely in order to pi’evail in this case?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Mr. Chief Justice.

No, I don’t really at all,

In fact, I think I can live within the

decided precedents on the subject.
QUESTION:

Mr. Friedman, your response to Justice

Waite's question that you are not relying on Hew York
procedural niceties has certain overtones of ranking a virtue
out of necessity because I take it if you were to bottom
the argument on procedural niceties, this is really nothing
like a set-off in the traditional sense that lawyers use the
word.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

You mean, to the extent that we

would be reaching a judgment by a co-defendant?

I would

agree with that, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Friedman

Mr. Rabinowltz.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF VICTOR RABBI OW IT Z, ESQ,,,
OH BEHALF OF
RESPONDENTS
; v■ ■
MR. RABBIOWITZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I would like to start off, if I may,

with the

discussion that Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Rehnquist
have been having because I suggested in filing my

brief her

that this petition for certiorari was improvidently
granted and should be dismissed.
And one of the reasons that I -urged was that no
judgment can be collected here

collected -- it can

perhaps be obtained, if the Petitioner wins, but no judgment
can be collected here under any foreseeable circumstances
and therefore, this case, while not moot in a constitutional

sense, that is, there is a case of controversy, under
Article III, nevertheless, it is, for all practical purposes,
pointless and it is

pointless because all Cuban assets are

frozen and the Treasury Department, xdaich has the task of
licensing the expenditure of funds out of frozen funds, has
indicated already, as we knew all along it would, that it
will not license the execution of any Dunhill excess judg­
ment against assets which are otherwise frozen, whether it
be a. bank account, as Mr» Justice White suggests, or one of
the other judgments that has been obtained as

against

Faber Coe, as Mr. Friedman suggests.
Therefore, we have a situation which is the kin,
shall we say, to an action in which Plaintiff is suing a
person who is concededly and obviously insolvent.
The total number of claims filed against Cuban
assets in the United States amounts to $1 billion 799 million.
How, I don't know what the amount of frozen funds
are, but if they amount to a few million dollars, it is a
lot.

If this $53?000 judgment is collected from those funds,

and I don't believe it can be, but if it is collected from
those funds, we have pennies, depending on the outcome of
this litigation.
And I don't believe it can be because the pro­
cedure that is followed in all of these cases and that has
been followed in the Cuba cs.se, is to require a

debtor to

file a claim with the foreign claims settlement commission
and not to bring a lawsuit.
Dunhlll chose to bring a lawsuit instead of filing
a claim.

Row, I suppose it has the right to do that but

if past precedent in handling these cases is any guide to
what the future may bring, and of course, I have no crystal

QUESTION:

Q

What about the set-off — face-to-face

set-off?
MR.. RABIHOWITZ:

Well, so .far as the face-to-face

set-off is concerned, it is my understanding that that will
be recognized by foreign 'assets control.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. RABBIQWITZ:

So, to that extent, the face-to-

face set-off, which, of course, was not the subject of this
petition for cert.
It is the subject of another petition for

27
certiorari which Cuba has filed.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

I understand that.

But you don't claim that this present argument you make

Ho., no.

Or anything like it, as a matter of

fact.
MR. RABIMOWITZ:
not.

As far as I know now, it would

I don’t know what the attitude of foreign assests

control would be on that subject, but I am inclined to think
that a face-to-face set-off would be recognized by the
Treasury Department.
How, on the question of is there an Act of State
here?

I don’t know whether I ought to be flattered or the

e ontrary at being suggested that I have the power to commit
an Act of State.

I have no such power and in no statement

that I ever made in court is to be considered to be an Act
of State.
Cuba here received funds and claimed that it was
/

entitled to those funds.

Hence, it refuses to return the
: -t-

money and it has retained counsel to plead its right to
those funds and that is what cotinsel has been doing to the
best of its ability.
How, that claim is not a frivolous or a capricious
or an arbitrary claim.

It is based, as Fir, Friedman was

28
kind enough to state, on a nationalization decree, a decree
which was adopted on September 17th, I960 and which purported
to nationalize all of the assets of Cuban ~~ not American -but Cuban concerns — the manufacture of tobacco — cigars ~~
in Cuba and to nationalize not only the physical property
in Cuba, but also the accounts receivable.
The question as to whether this nationalization
decree extended to the accounts receivable was litigated.
We lost in the District Court.

We lost in the Court of

Appeals and pursuant to instructions — specific, I might
say -— instructions by my client, I have filed a petition
for certiorari which is one of those issues that is pending
in the other case and the issue there revolves around this
rather metaphysical question, what is the situs of the debt?
If the situs of the debt was in Havana, then it
was nationalized.

If the situs of the debt was in Mew York,

then it was not nationalized.
That is an issue which is not before us.

I mention

i t only to show that the claim, of Act of State here was not
disconnected or irrelevant to the nationalization decree
because if that nationalization decree did, in fact -- and
I am advised that under Cuban law it would have — if that
nationalization decree did, in fact, attach or nationalize
the accounts receivable, then we are entitled — Cuba is
entitled to the fund3 for pre-intervention cigars.

MR. RABINOWITZ:

The same question was raised, I think, by Mr.

Blackmun in the City Bank case.

Our goal in this case and in

the Chase case — which is behind us — hasn't come up here

if you have to pay anything back, it comes out

MR. FRIEDMAN:

The court held that the former

owners are entitled to a set-off -- are entitled to a judgment
against Cuba which is a set-off -- it is very complicated -The court held that the former owners were entitled
to that money.

They are entitled to the money from Dunhill,

which was the debtor and therefore, Dunhill is ordered to
pay that money to the former owners.
Dunhill, however, paid the money to Cuba — said
the court —• by mistake.

Therefore, it is entitled to get

that precise sum back fx*om us so whatever it has to pay the
former oxmers, it collects from us, except for this $53?000
because we contend there is no way in which it can collect
an affirmative judgment of $53?000 from Cuba.
I feel a little bad to keep saying "us” in here
because it may give the court some idea that I am the state,
but I am not.

I am just speaking as counsel.

32
QUESTION:

When you — well, I think you have

answered the question. I was about to ask.
MR, FRIEDMASJ:

How, counsel has made much in his

brief and again in his oral argument to the contention or
the argument which said that Cuba never admitted receiving
the funds.

How, of course, that is not so.
What happened was that the claim was made that

large sums of money had been paid.

This claim did not come

to light until 1967* which was some seven years after
national!zati cn.
By that, time, the

all of the relevant records

had been lost, destroyed or at least they were not available
and so the Republic of Cuba said, in response to a set of
interrogatories, "We do not know.
yes.

We received it."

were endorsed checks.

As to $93*000 of the total,

Because there were records.

There

"as to the balance, we do not know

whether we received it or not."
The District Court held that the evidence w^as
sufficient that we had received it.

The Court of Appeals

held that the evidence was sufficient that we had received
it.

We are not applying for cert on that issue and there­

fore, I will assume that so far as this record is concerned,
t'je have received it.
How, of course, if we didn’t receive it, then
Dunhill has no claim at all.

Dunhill’s whole claim here is

33
based on the fact that it paid money to us by mistake.

If

it didn' t pay it, then the'whole of Dunhill's claim falls
and, therefore, we really think that the Petitioner is faced
with the fact that whatever may be ultimate truth — so far
as the record is concerned, Cuba got the money and also it
is clear that so far as the record is concerned, Cuba, basing
its arguments on a nationalizaticn decree, says it does not
have to repay the money and we submit that that is an Act
of State because, as has been conceded, no particular
formality is required.
QUESTI (N:

Whsfc got the money?

has it the fund

that got the money or Cuba got the money?
MR. RABINOWITZ:

Which?

Cuba got the money in September

of I960.
QUESTION:

Before the nationalization?

MR. RABINOWITZ:

Bridging the nationalization.

Some of it before the nationalization, some of it after the
nationalization.
QUESTICN:

But in any event, it didn't go to the

fund.
MR. RABINOWITZ:

It went to Cuba.

Oh, by that time, money was being shipped to Cuba.
The freeze didn't come till 1963.

Up to that point, the

money went down to Cuba.
Now, it is perfectly clear from all of the cases

34
cases that a course of conduct Is sufficient to constitute
arx Act of State.

We have a great deal of state action here,

much more than in Ricaud, Oetjen and Bernstein and the other
traditional Act of State cases and as

I

have indicated, this

continuing interest and continuing determination by Cuba to
assert this claim is an indication on the part of Cuba that
it believes that under it3 ovm. nationalization decree and
its own view of the law, it is entitled to this money.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rabinowitz, when you say thetwhile

this case is not technically moot in /the traditional sense,
that it is., for all practical purposes, there is nothing
left of it,. !^s that because the claims against the $1 billion

MR. RABINOWITZ:

Commission,

compared to the amount

I don't know what

disposition is going to be made of that.

All I can say is

36
that the precedent followed in all of the other cases was to
say specifically the judgments will not be permitted said
that claims before the ~~ filed with the Foreign Claims
Settlement Commission are the only source of getting money
and remember, so far as these settlements in the past have
been concerned, the issue beomes ~~ is really a dual one.
One is between the United States and the foreign
country and that settles how much money is to be paid.
The second step is that the United States dis­
tributes this money to its citizens and in the treaties that
have been entered into with Rumania and the other countries
that I have mentioned, the United States has specifically
waived, on behalf of its citizens, all judgments which the
citizen may have obtained or may in the future obtain
against the foreign government for those presettlement
claims, shall we say so that while, as I say, I can’t even
venture to predict what is going to happen here if the
Polish and Rumanian and other settlements are reached here,
the judgment is really of absolutely no value in this
situation and what we are discussing here is very interesting
academic and,, to me, rather vital questions of law and I am
always delighted to discuss them but in terms of the prac­
tical effect of what we are getting here, it is going to
turn out to be nothing at all.

MR. RABINQWITZ:

Weil., Cuba is defending it right

told, me to come here and since I always enjoy
this court, here I am.

arguing before

But Cuba is proceeding with all of

the other litigation because, as I said before, my client
apparently — nobody has told me this, but I can draw
reasonable inference, my client feels that it will be good
to have this money in that frozen account as against some day
when there is going to be a settlement.

And the more money

there is in that frozen account, the better it is going to be
for my client.

33
Now, maybe it will be better for everybody, I
don't know, but it is going to be better for my client.
To put it another way — if I may -- I don't
suppose this is a breach of professional confidence, as one
of my clients said to me ~~ nIs it better to have a raillion
dollars in that fund or not to have a million dollars in the
fund?”

And my answer was,

"Well, it is better to have a

million dollars in the fund."

I

don't know exactly why it is better.

I just

think it is better to have that much money in the fund than
not to have that much money in the fund.

QUESTION:

What if Petitioners were to take their

judgment to Prance or England or try to locate Cuban assets
there and a3k for full faith and credit or whatever the
French or English equivalent of that is?
MR. RABBT O'WITZ:

I don’t know, maybe.

I — I don't know how the

French courts or the German courts or the English courts
would treat a matter like this and I ara sure that they have
their

I submit that we have here as much

evidence, as much of an act -- I don't know what counsel
means when he keeps talking about a public act.

I don't

know what exactly a piiblic act is.
In the French against Banco Hacional in the Hew
York Court of Appeals, the act involves a piece of paper
called an "instruction,” which was posted on the bulletin
board of the Hacional Banc or the Currency Stabilization
Board in Cube, and that was regarded as an Act of State.

QUESTION:

Are you free —* and I put that limita­

tion on it — are you free to offer a hypothesis as to why
the Government

of Cuba has not made any formal claim of

Act of State, but has simply depended upon a litigation

MR. RABIHOWITZ:

You mean, why it has not made a

decree or written a piece of paper?
QUESTION:

Written letters.

The Secretary of State

of the United States often does in these circumstances.
MR. RABIN OWITZ:

I think that the opinion of the

Cuban Government is that the nationalisation decree is quite
sufficient and that there is no particular point in repeating
over and over again that it claims that it nationalised these
accounts receivable and, therefore, it is entitled to that
money.
QUESTION:

That i3, the decree of September I5'bh,

I960?
MR. RABIN OWITZ:

September, I960, yes, sir.

That nationalized everything, didn’t

it?
MR. RABINOWITZ:

That's right, it nationalized

everything and I suppose that there is no -- the Government
does not feel any compulsion to keep repeating this because
governments are not always quick to issue documents.
QUESTION:

Is not part of the debate whether that

decree of national!zaticn reached assets outside of Cuba?
MR. RABINOWITZ:

Yes, that is part of the debate

and there is no question ~QUESTION:

No one is challenging in this litigation

that Cuba, by its decree of nationalization, could seize
and exert sovereign power over assets in Cuba.

k2
MR. RABIHOWITZ:

Oh, no.

Mo, that is not at

issue.
QUESTION:

Well, an asset somewhere else is

another matter, is it not?
MR. RABINOWITZ:

Exactly, that is an issue, but

whether that seizure i3 valid under United States law, the
seizure of accounts receivable, I mean.
It is valid under United States laws or not valid
under the United States law has nothing to do with whether
it is an Act of State.

The fact is, it is an Act of State.

Now, maybe they attempted to do something that
they couldn't do.

If it is true that a debt has its situs,

and as I said before, it is a .rather metaphysical problem.,
but a. debt has its situs in the home of the debtor, then
this was an ineffective nationalisation decree because it
sought to nationalize property outside the territory.
But in the Cuban, view, this was not so and I have.1,
as I say, so argued in this petition for

certiorari which

is before the Court pending at this moment.
I would like to procede to the second
which is the so-called "counterclaim” rule.

Thank you, sir.

I would like to spend my remaining time on the
whole problem of the counterclaim area but, just for a
moment before I get to that, I would like to make one thing
clear if it is not already clear:
While I said that the nationalization decree of
September, I960 nationalized not only the physical property
but also the accounts receivable and therefore the problem
arose as to where these accounts receivable were located,
of course it is true that shortly after — two or three
months after the nationalization decree, the money repre­
sented by these accounts receivable did, in fact, get to
Cuba so that it was no longex* a question of nationalizing
intangibles which were located in a foreign country, but
then became a question of the effect of the nationalization
decree on that money which was then in Cuba so that from the
position of the Respondent —

that is why Cuba is under an obligation to pay it back and,
of course, the nationalization decree —

QUESTION:

I thought you said

earlier there was

no freeze order until long after -MR. RABUJOWITZ:

Long after, three years later.

Three years later.
Now, on the question of the counterclaim rule, as
I said, in the City Bank case this

Court had before it a

letter from the State Department which said that the Act of
State Doctrine in this opinion was not to be applied In the
counterclaim situation and I quote, "The amount of the relief
to be granted Is limited to the amount of the foreign, state's
claim and the foreign policy interests of the United States
do not require application of the doctrine."
The letter then went on to say that the foreign
policy interests of the United States do not require the

applicati esa of the Act of State Doctrine to bar adjudication
of a Defendant’s claim or set-off against the Government of
Cuba in these circumstances and hence the Act of State
Doctrine should not be applied in this or like cases.
How, there is no State Department letter here, of
course, and I must, with due respect, your Honor,

say that

at least so far as the cases I am familiar with, the State
Department has never suis i>onte, written a letter.
In the Sabbatino case, the State Department
participated, not only as Amicus, but in argument, but that
was on the motion of the Court, not on its own motion, or not
by its own request.
QUEST I CM:

As a matter of fact, in the Sabbat ino

case, they refused to corae into the Court of Appeals, didn’t
they?
D3R. RABIMOWITZ:
did and in — quite right.

Yes, they did, sir.

Yes, they

And in the City Bank case, it is

my understanding that they came in at the request of City
Bank or at least at the suggestion of City Bank and since
then, in other cases which, are pending in the District
Court — in one case, they did submit a letter.
cases they have refused to submit letters.

In other

'What motivates

them one way or the other, I don’t know.
The most recent was a refusal to submit three
letters in cases involving three banks.

47
How, the Petitioner's argument here is based on
three assumptions, none of which,! respectfully submit, is
valid.
First, that there was a ruling by this Court in
the City Bank case that there wa3 a counterclaim exception
to the Sabbatino rule.
Second, that the Stevenson letter submitted in
City Bank is applicable to this case.
And, third, that there is an exception to what 1
contend is a non-existent counterclaim rule which would
permit the Petiti cner to get an affirmative judgment in this
case.
How, as your Honors I am sure will recall in the
City Bank case, there was only one opinion out of Mr. Justice
Douglas which opted for a straight out-and-out counterclaim
exception to the Sabbatino case.
Three judges thought that there should be a counter­
claim exception when there was a State Department letter, as
there was in that case.
Five judges, as I read the opinion, felt thab there
should not he a counterclaim exception to the Sabbatino rule.
So it is rather difficult to say — talk about a counter­
claim rule in the Haticnal City Bank case, because, as I
read those opinions, the vote would have been, on that issue,
four to five.

yours is not yet acted on, is it, that there shouldn't be
any set-off in this case?
MR. RABUSOWITZ:

Oh, yes.

Yes, sir,

And just

may I 3ay, in final conclusion, that I would suggest that
this Court dispose of this matter here in one of two ways:
Either grant those other two petitions that are
pending and that we really go at this rather tangled situation
and decide all of the issues or else that the petition be
dismissed as inadvertently granted.
QUESTION:

Do you suggest it be denied?

MR. RABIN OWIT Z:
QUESTION:

Of course, I ~~

Pardon?

If this is dismissed as imprevidently

granted, do you suggest we deny the other two?
MR, RABETOWITZ:

If this is dismissed, I would

think that the others ought to be- denied, yes.
If this is entertained, I think the others ought
to be entertained, unless your Honors -QUESTION:

Which would you prefer?

Which would you prefer, dismisss.l as improvidently
granted or an affirmance?
QUESTION:

At least that dismissal, if inadvertently

granted, was improvident.
HR. RABBTOWITZ:

No, it wasn’t inadvertent, your

Honor.
QUESTION:

No, it was not, I can assure you.

50

MR, RABINOWITZ;
inadvertent.

I misspoke.

Ho, I am certain it was not
I think it i^as imprevidently

granted.
Which would I prefer?

Well, I do love to argue

cases —
QUESTION*

It is very difficult, isn't it?

MR. RABINOWITZ:

Yes, it is difficult.

I love

to argue cases before this Court and the prospect of
another go-round at this is very attractive to me,
QUESTION:

Still.

MR, RABINOWITZ:
best if every

But still, I think; it might be

if we let the Court of Appeals —

QUESTION:

I would have guessed you wouldn't lave

wanted it affirmed.
I©. RABINOWITZ:

I think — I think I

would like

it to be — either affirmed — I have no objection to an
affirmance.
QUESTION:

Well, wculd you prefer that to a

dismissal?
MR. RABINOWITZ:
QUESTION:

I don't know that it matters —

All right.

MR. RABBIOWITZ:

— a great deal.

I think I would

prefer dismissal to an affirmance.
QUESTION:
the choice.

It isn't very often we give a counsel

51
(Laughter.)
MR. RABIN OWITZ:

I am under no illusion that you

are giving me the choice.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Friedman, vre will

extend your time to five minutes from your previous three.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Thanh you, Mr. Chief Justice.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF
VICTOR S. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I would just like to respond to

a fei»; remarks made by counsel for Respondent.
I turn first to the question again of what is the
Act of State in this case?
Mr. Rabinowitz has indicated that it may proceed
from one of two standpoints and I am still confused as to
where we really look to it.
I simply want to point out again, however, that if
it is the decree, I do not believe that this Court can rule
with respect to that issue on this petition.
Now, that i3 something that has not been raised
by the Respondents previous to this time and I respectfully
suggest that would affect rights of other par1 ties to this
action who are not now before this Court.
If, on the other hand, we are still dealing with
the question of the possible seizure or retention of assets
independently of the decree, I would suggest again that the

52
remarks in our brief are fully applicable and that is, that
there has been no proof whatsoever of any sovereign act
on the pent of Cuba in any form that is acceptable as
evidence in our courts.
I!d like to turn now to the questions that counsel
has raised with respect to the enforceability of this
judgment.
I do not pretend for a minute that it will be a
simple matter of simply going into court and enforcing this
judgment the way one would any other civil judgment.
I do not agree with counsel for Respondents, though,
that this is a worthless piece of paper.

There are a number

of possible vjays the judgment might be enforced and I do not
believe that this Court need consider how likely those
possibilities are or just exactly what our chances will be
to obtain a recovery under the judgment.
The fact of tbs matter is that there are possi­
bilities and Tire should be entitled to pursue them, certainly.
QUESTI OH:

Well, your set-off is money in the

pocket, isn't it?
HR. FRIEDMAN:
pocket, no,

The set-off is not money in the

sir.

QUEST I CM:

Well, what — it is money you don’t

have to pay?
HR. FRIEDMAH:

It is money we — the money that we

owe for the post-intervention shipments, that has already
been paid to Cuba —
QUESTION:

Yes.

HR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

-- for the preintervention, shipment.

Yes.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

To the extent that those are payment

for the preintervention shipments, we still must pay the

enters.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. FRIEDMAN:
there.

So there is no money in the pocket

In fact, if we were to recover on this judgment in

full, there 3till would not be a single penny coming to
Dunhill that would stay with Dunhill.

Dunhill would simply

have to turn that money over to the owners.
The only question is, whether we are going to have
to pay the owners and not recover back from the — from Cuba.
There is no way that Dunhill would recover a single
penny here that goes into Dunhill*s pockets.
That really raises another issue that was alluded
to by counsel for Respondents and that is the question of
why didn't Dunhill file a claim?
The simple answer is here that Dunhill 'was never
seeking anything from, anybody.

The only reason that Dunhill

is in the position that Dunhill is in now is because of the
conflicting claims that were asserted against it by both the

owners and the interventorsj

Dunhill, as well as the other

importers, always considering themselves in the position of
stakeholder and along those same lines, I would suggest that
the cut-off date which was alluded to for filing of claims,
we do not think is at all applicable here for at least two
reasons:
First, that refers to expropriations of property
and as I have Indicated, x\re do not helieve there ever was
any expropriation here.
Secondly, whatever the claim is that we might
file, to our knowledge was not in existence as of that cutoff date sometime in 1967If your Honors will recall, at •—
QUESTI®:

It isn't yet, or until litigation is

over here?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

Well, I would hope not, Mr. Justice.

The problem is that, as of that point in time, Cuba was
still contesting that they had ever received any money, so
it hardly lay in our mouths to make a claim against them for
money which the Court might later adjudge Cuba owed us but
we couldn't collect on.
QUESTION;
Dunhill?

When did the owners start to press

then did the owners start to press Dunhill for

payment?
I©. FRIEDMAN:

The owners brought suit in either

February or March of 1961.
QUEST Id!:

Waa that the first knowledge Dunhill

had of the owners’ claim?
MR. FRIEDMA1I:
QUEST^®:

So far as the record shows, yes.

Was it asserted as a defense in those

cases that the money was owed to and payable to Cuba, as the
owner?
MR. PRIEDMALI:

Mr. Chief Justice, as far as I know

as soon as those cases were filed, the interventors then
started their action against the owners’ counsel and all
proceedings vis-a-vis the importers were stayed.
So far as I know, I don’t believe that the
importers had any connection with these cases,
be named as defendants by the owners, until 1967

except to
or 1966,

I guess.
I would just make one other point with respect to
the question of a license.

Counsel has stated that the

Office of Foreign Assets Control has said in no uncertain
terms that a license will not be issued.

I think if the

Court will look at the Appendix to Respondents’ brief, which
contains the exchange of correspondence between Respondents
and that office, it will find that that is not the position
of that office.

They have set forth a general -policy, but

that does not say that that is their final position or, if
it is, that it x«rould not be subject to review in the courts

5o
or that it might not be influenced by a ruling by this
Court in this proceedings.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Mhereupon, at 1:13 o’clock p«m., the case was
submitted.)
