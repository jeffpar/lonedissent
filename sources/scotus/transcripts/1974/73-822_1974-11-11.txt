PRO C E E D I H G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll hear arguments next

in 73-822, Fry and Boehm against the United States.
Mr. Brown, yon may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN A. BROWN , ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BROWN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
Excuse me for not getting up, that's something I
do less well.
We are here today on a case that is, at least in
our judgment, extremely important to all fifty States.

We

are here on a petition for a writ of certiorari granted by
this Court last February.
The matter all began in the State of Ohio.

The

Ohio 109th General Assembly passed a bill. Amended Substitute
Senate Bill No. 147, and it was signed by Governor Gilligan,
and to be effective on the first day of the pay period which
included January 1, 1972.
The bill provided for a pay increase for all State
employees of either 38 cents per hour or ten percent, whichever
was more.

It averaged out to be a pay increase of roughly

7.7 percent for all State employees.
After the statute was passed, signed by the Governor,
the State of Ohio asked the Federal Pay Board for authority

to pay the increase the Ohio General Assembly had enacted.
The Pay Board heard the petition, granted the
authority to make the increase effective,, March .10, 1972,
So there was a period of roughly two and one-half months when
the pay increase was not paid,.

The Federal Pay Board decided

that the amount that would be paid than, from March 10, 1972
through the remainder of the biennium would equal an amount
that would be consistent with the Federal Pay Board’s standards.
Thereafter we filed an action in mandamus in the
Supreme Court of Ohio in which we asked the Ohio Supreme Court
to order, direct the State officials to pay the increase that
the Ohio General Assembly said they should pay.
The Ohio Supreme Court issued the mandate that we
requested.

Immediately the Federal Government sought -and

obtained a temporary restraining order from the Federal
District Court in Ohio, which was then continued! by the
Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals here in Washington,

And

when, the matter came to the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals
they ruled that the pay increase was beyond the scope of
Ohio to get, that the State of Ohio was enjoined from doing
What the Supreme Court of Ohio had ordered the Governor in
the order to do.
We then filed our petition hereunder the Tenth
Amendment to the United States Constitution, and we filed the
motion not as an academic matter but because we seriously,

honestly contend that the Tenth Amendment to the United
States Constitution prevents the Federal Pay Board and the
Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals from doing what it did do.
Now, after this Court granted the petition last
February, the United States has filed a motion asking that
the writ now be ruled to have been improvidently granted —
to use the words of the Solicitor General,

They argue that

it be, even though that since the decision of the TECA a
situation has occurred in California, in which a situation
very similar to this occurred, when the California General
Assembly passed a pay increase for its employees, and the
California Governor went to the Pay Board, as the Ohio
Governor did, got authority, which was only partially what
the statute said, the California employees went to the
California Supreme Court in mandamus, as Ohio did.

The

California Supreme Court granted the writ, again as Ohio
did, then the Federal Government filed a petition for an
injunction in California, again as 'they did in Ohio.
The injunction was granted, and -thereafter an appeal
was taken to the TECA, and to the government's surprise
or we guess it's their surprise — the TECA reversed in the
-Q&TI

case in California, saying that the reason they

reversed is the injunction was applied for on May 14, 1974,
which was two weeks after the Economic Stabilization Act had
expired.

6

And we understand, although it is not in

the record,

that the government has filed a. petition for a writ of
certiorari in that case, and it seems to us anomalous, to say
the least, that the government would, on the one hand, contend
that our writ should be dismissed as being improvidently
granted and, on the other hand, contend that a case d£ almost
exactly similar import should be admitted by this Court in
Coati. vs. State of California.
QUESTION:

Mr. Brovm, did I understand you to say

then that was during a period of time that tho government has
or plans to file a writ of certiorari to review the judgment
of the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals of September 19,
1974, in the case of United States of America v. State of
California?
MR. BRCWN:

That's my understanding.

QUESTION: Because I was going to ask you ~~ now that
I have you interrupted -■-* what effect — assume that the
decision in the California case

of the Temporary Emergency

Court of Appeals remains undisturbed, what effect would that
have Upon the viability, continued importance, or even
continued viability of your litigation?
As I understand it here, under this decision — now
you tell me if I'm mistaken

your clients will get everything

they're asking for, won't they?
MR. BROWN:

Well, there is no question but that when

7
the TECA acted in our case, the Act had not expired, so that
the injunction that was issued remains.

In the Coan vs„ State

of California, TECA decided that the application for the
injunction came two weeks after the Act had expired.
So that I think the answer is that Ohio is enjoined
and California is not,
QUESTION: Well, is that the reasoning -— is that
the reasoning of this Court of Appeals?
MR, BROWN:

Of the Emergency Court of Appeals?

I

think so.
QUESTION; They talk about an enforcement proceeding.
I just glanced at this, I haven’t read it carefully, but I —
you think, therefore, that this — assuming that this decision
remains unchanged, that it would have, give your clients no
benefit at all?
MR. BROWN:

Not in i±ie present posture,

we would

have to do something more than has been done.
Now, I think I'm obligated to say to the Court that
we filed an action six weeks ago in the Ohio Supreme Court
again, asking for another mandate, saying?

Pay the money now.

Now, if the Supreme Court of Ohio, in December '74
or February of !75, issued another order to Governor Gilligan
and Auditor Tracy and said, Pay the money now.
QUESTION:
February of 8 75 ,

It wouldn't be Governor Gilligan in

8
[Laughter.]
MR. BROWN: As a great

many of my friends have

reminded me, that63 true.
If they said, Governor Rhodes, pay the money, or
Auditor Traci?, pay the money — or Ferguson, rather, pay the
money, the Federal Government would not be able to cm join
that mandate now.
Unless it would be interpreted that the order of
September of '73 from the TECA was broad enough to cover what
the Supreme Court might do later.
QUESTION: But certainly that83 not going to be your
position?
MR. BROWNS That's true.
QUESTION:

In that litigation.

QUESTION:

At least they could give a prospective

wage increase without interference by the Federal Government
now.
MR. BROWN:

True.

QUESTION: And make up for it indirectly that way,
assuming they had the same employees that they had before.
MR. BROWN1

Yes, and of course the employees will

be markedly different, because we’re talking about some 55,000
State employees, or thereabouts, and in two years they have
changed markedly.

But the Ohio General Assembly could, when

it goes into session in January of 1975, grant a pay increase

9
to, in effect, make up for what the employees, some ten and
a half million dollars that they did not receive too years
ago, plus.
QUESTIONS

Could they give it retroactive —• under

Ohio law, could your Legislature now give a retroactive pay
allowance, Mr. Brown?
MR. BROWN:

I don't know the answer to that.

QUESTION:

Well, if they could, do you think

there’s anything — any barrier to that in the federal law?
MR. BROWN:
QUESTION:

No.
Or in this injunction?

MR. BROWN; That I'm not sure of.

The injunction,

by its terms, and the Court will see on the last paragraph
of -the Order of the TECA, is very broad, end how that might
be interpreted to apply, if the State of Ohio now tried to
pass a retroactive pay increase, I simply don’t know.
I would not like the question to occur.
QUESTION:

As a general rule in periods when there

were pay freezes, it would make a mockery out of the efforts
to control wages and prices, x-rould it not?
MR. BROWN:

I'm sorry, I didn't hear all your

question.
QUESTION:

Well, if it is true that after a pay

freeze is off, such as we had during, I think, the Korean War
and various other emergency periods, if afterward the

10

employers could come along and make it up, and it was
identified as such, it wouldn!t have very much meaning in
terms of the power of the government to deal with emergencies,
would it?
MR. BROWN:

Agreed,

And of course there have been

ample precedents which say that if Company A and Labor Union B
agree that a pay increase will be made to employees of X dollars
per hour, X cents per hour, after the freeze expires, that
agreement is no good at all.
Now, the. question about what would happen if Ohio
now tried to retroactively do something in January br February
of 1975, I don't think it has been answered.
The point we want to emphasize most, we think, in
oral argument is that what the TECA seemed to say was that
Maryland vs. Wlrts, decided by this Court, answered the appeal
we made to the TECA a year ago.

Wa contend it certainly dees

not.
That Mary1and v, Wirtz decided that the amendments to
the Fair Labor Standards Act, as applied to State schools and
State institutions for the mentally retarded, et cetera,
limited the State's authority to act and that the FLSA amend­
ments ware constitutional.

But in both the majority and the

minority — or the dissent in Maryland v. Wirtt, there is a
great deal of language indicating that if the United States
Congress had in the FLSA said that the minimum wage that the

11

State of Ohio shall pay to all its employees shall be $2.20
per hour, that this would not have been permissible under the
Tenth Amendment„
We maintain that you cannot,

read the Tenth Amendment

as having any meaning at all, and say that the Congress of
the United States may do that.
Wow, Chief Justice Hughes, many years age; in this
Court said that the Tenth Amendment of the United States
Congress is meaningful and, to an argument a lawyer raised,
that if some Act of Congress was not restrained it would
harm the courts or harm, the States and destroy the States or
devour their sovereignty. Chief Justice Hughes said;

Not

■while this Court sits.
But we submit that if here the argument or the
contentions of the TECA would be supported by this Court,
then the Tenth Amendment will have very little meaning left
in what not only Chief Justice Hughes but Justice Cardoso and
many others have warned against would certainly be occurring.
I would like to save what remaining moments 1 have
to reply.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Thank you.
Mrs, Lafontant.

Very well, Mr. Brown.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. JEWEL S. LAFOMTANT,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MBS. LAFONTANT:

Mr. Chief Justice? and may it

please the Court;
The Economic Stabilization Act was brought into
effect in August of 1970? and expired of its own terms on
April the 30th? 1974.
The Act? under Section 203? authorised the President
to issue orders and regulations to stabilize? among other things?
salaries and wages at levels not less than those that wore
prevailing on May 25th? 1970„
And pursuant to such orders and regulations ? the
Pay Board issued its own regulations which limited the annual
wage or salary increase to 5.5 percent for all persons subject
to the regulation.
On January the 15th? 1972? the Ohio General Assembly
passed Senate Bill 147? known as the Pay Bill Act, Which
provided for an average increase of 10.5 percent beginning
January the 1st? 572. for 65,000 employees of the State of Ohio?
the State universities, and the county welfare departments.
Subsequent thereto? Ohio filed an application to the
Pay Board for an exception.. They asked that they be. permitted
to pay the 10.6 percent increase. The Pay Board permitted them
only to pay 7 percent from January the 1st? * 72 to March 10th?
'72? but thereafter the Pay Board approved the increase in its

entirety of 10,6 percent.
The Ohio Supreme Court, pursuant to applicatior of
Ohio, issued writs of mandamus, commanding the officers of
the State to pay the entire increases.

The officers of the

State of Ohio to pay the entire increases.
•The United States instituted this action in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of
Ohio, to enjoin Ohio and its officers from paying out the
increases that were in excess of those authorised by the
Pay Board.
And the District Court restrained Ohio from paying
the increases, and the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals
issued a permanent injunction on October 25th, 1973, restraining
Ohio and its officers from paying these increases.
I might add that since the termination of the
Economic Stabilisation Act on April 30th, 1974, there’s been
no application by petitioners for dissolution of that injunction*
which is still in full force and effect,
But, mind you, the injunction wa3 entered before the
expiration of the Act.
Now, this Court
QUESTION;

Would the government resist an

application to dissolve that injunction?
MRS. LAFONTANTs Would we
QUESTION;

Unh-hunh.

resist?

MRS. LAFCNTANT:

I would assume so, based on the

particular facts we would perhaps resist it.

I think it would

turn upon the briefings that are brought to us, whether or not
we would still be in good stead in resisting it.

We would

still have the authority, and we might not resist it, but
certainly we would have that right, and I can*t see at this
point whether ws would or would not.
But 2 am saying -that the petitioners were in a
position at that time to move to dissolve the injunction,
because the Act was no longer in effect.
Now, tills Court has consistently refused to pass
upon the constitutionality of the statute where, at the time
that it comes before the Court, the statute has expired by
its own terms or has been repealed, or has ceased' to ha of
any effect. And of course we know so many of the cases that
substantiate that, and 1 have in mind in particular the Rice
vs« Sioux City Memorial Cemetery case, where, after this
Court had granted a writ of certiorari, upon learning that
’the particular State had repealed its lav?, this Court dismissed
the writ of certiorari for being improvidently granted.
At this point I would like to say, too, that the
government has not asked that this case be dismissed for
being improvidently granted.

Our exact language is that we

want it to — we think it should be dismissed because it’s no
longer of continuing importance.

QUESTION:

But either way would leave the judgment

of the TECA in effect, would it not?
MRS. LAFONTANT:

Yes, it would.

Now, in the instant case the Economic Stabilisation
expired on its own terms, as I said, on April 30th of ‘74,
but of course this writ of certiorari was issued before that
time.
Now, beside the purely abstract question of the right
of Ohio to pay wages to its employees without any restraints or
interference fron the federal government, the only matter
before the Court is the residual pecuniary interests of these
employees to the amount of the money? that is, some $15
million, and when spread over all the employees amounts to
around $200 or more for each employee.
The immediate restraint upon Ohio that prevents it
from paying the money to the employees is the injunctive
order of 'the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals.
Because of the fact that the purpose of the Act
and of the injunctive order in support of the Act was to
reduce during the effectiveness of the Act the supply of
money in circulation by putting a limit on pay increases,
it would seem to me that a. very substantial question of law
is now raised, and that question iss

whether upon the

termination of the .Act application for dissolution of the
injunction should not be granted, as a matter of right to the

16
petitioners.

This is a legal question that should be

determined.
We respectfully submit that at the expiration of the
Act, the petitioners should have made application to the
Temporary Emergency Court, of Appeals for dissolution of the
injunction. They did not, but instead they chose to pursue
the attack on the constitutionality of the Act itself.
We submit that the constitutionality issue is of no
longer continuing importance.

The*writ of certiorari;was

properly granted, because at that time the Act was in full fore: :
and effect? but since it has been granted, the Act lias1
expired.

And we say it's of no continuing importance, it's

not very likely that this case can —• this issue can arise in
any other courts concerning wages and salaries for periods
after April 30th, '74.
QUESTION:

Does your argument take into consideration

what I read in -the newspapers?
MRS.LAFONTANTs

I don't know what you're reading in

the newspapers, if you please.
QUESTION: Well, prices have gone up through the
ceiling, and this thing might be back in effect within a day
or so.
MRS. LAFOUTANTs Well, that’s not before tills Court
at this point, but I do
QJESTION:

I can't forget it.

17
MRS, LAFONTANTs

I think a lot -- you cannot forget

it.
What can happen in the future# or what will happen
in the future# I don’t know. Whether or not there is going
to be a further need for any kind of legislation like this#
I don’t know who can say.

But I don’t believe that this

Court has to determine the constitutionality of an Act that
may be put into effect at some time in the future.
1 think the Court has to act on what is before it.
QUESTIONS

I wish you could give a better word to

it -MRS. LAFONTANT:

And# of course# if you can decide

it without going into the constitutionality# I think -—
QUESTION:

If you can get a better word than "may"#

I might go along with you.
MRS. LAFONTANT:

A better word than "may”?

All right.
I don’t know where I had the "may" at this point.
[Laughter.j
QUESTION:

Now# before you resume

MRS. LAFONTANT: And second «—
QUESTION;

Mrs. Lafontant# perhaps you have already

told the Court# but if so I missed it.

Has the government

petitioned for certiorari# or does it plan to # for this
September decision of the Emergency Court of Appeals?

13
MRS. LAFOMTANT:

I can speak very honestly to you,

and when I read this in Mr, Brown’s reply, I checked all over
the Department.

We have not filed any petition for writ of

cerrfcicr-’ari in the California case.

We have filed a motion

for rehearing, which is going to take place, I think, next
Tuesday or Wednesday, ~~
QUESTION;

Then the time --

MRS, LAFONTANT:

— when there will be a hearing on

that.
But we have not filed a petition for writ of
certiorari, and I think before I could even answer that, the
Department would have to look into all the aspects of the
case to see if one would be warranted.
QUESTIONs Well, I suppose you wouldn't even begin to
face that question until the Court acts on your petition for
rehearing, wouldn't that be it?
MRS. LAFONTANT: That’s right.

That's right.

Exactly.

And it hasn't. We have filed our petition for
rehearing and —
QUESTIONS And that's under submission, is it?
MRS. LAFQHTANT:

— I understand — yes.

I understand

it is hoped that it will be heard Tuesday or Wednesday? but
I think at that time we would make a determination what we should
do.
QUESTION

%

1 sea.

19
MRS. LAFONTANT;

Bat we have not filed it, and X

was intending to clear it up a little later, but I'm glad
you asked me that now.
QUESTION:

2 suppose you feel this case is governed

by Maryland v, Wlrts?
MRS. LAFONTANTs

Yes, 1 do, very much so.

And

before I got into that I had one other issue 1 wanted to
cover, but would you prefer that I get into it now?
QUESTION: Well, I just wanted a flat answer and
then —
MRS. IiAFONTANT s

Yes. Very definitely we feel that

Maryland v, Wirta is controlling, and if there was any
interference into the role of State sovereignty, perhaps it
was more interference in Maryland vs. vvirta than her©.
But even before we get to 'that, as you may have
noticed, three of the amici raised for the first time an issue
which was not raised by the petitioners.

They contend that

the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 doesn’t even apply
to the States.
But since this was net raised in the petition, we
don’t feel that it*a properly before the Court, but perhaps
does require some response.
In any event., we feel that both the language and
the legislative history of the Act show that Congress intended
to include State employees in this Act.

20
And I will turn to page 12 of our brief, just to
point to a few of the things that was said that would indicate
that.
The regulationed -define "person'5 to include "any
State or local government unit or instrumentality of such
government unit.”
In Section 203(b)(3) they speak of -- it sets out
very definitely that the standards to be adopted governing
acceptable levels of wages and salaries were to "call for
generally comparable sacrifices by business and labor as well
as ether segments of the population’."
And, further, when Senator Proxmire, at -the Sonata
hearings, prefaced his remarks when he was introducing a
bill to have the States exempted, he conceded that ordinarily
higher salaries for State and local workers result in a
gruatur demand on the economy, and higher wages drive prices
upb and. that this is largely responsible for the inflation we
are suffering.
But he tried to make a distinction — yes?
QUESTIONs
or could Congress go?

Hex; far may a State go in this respect,
Could Congress impose a ceiling on

Stata spending, on State budgets?

Could Congress say State

salaries not only shall not be increased during this period
but they should be lowered 15 percent?
valid, do you think?

Would all this bs

MRS e LAFONTANT:

I think it. all would have to go

back to the question whether it would be — Congress would
have a rational basis for determining that under the commerce
powers this is a necessity.
QUESTION: Some thirty-odd years ago, it seems to
me the federal government reduced the salaries of all
government employees some ten percent or something1 of that
kind?
Supposes in such a period they said this is acrossthe-board:

all federal employees, all public employees

everywhere else.

To pursue Mr. Justice Blackmail's question.

MRS, LAFONTANT:

You mean, you said the federal

government reduced it by ten pereant for —
QUESTION:

Its own employees and rail other public

employees„
MRS. LAFONTANT:

I think it would all have to go

back to the question of rational basis and whether

it was

necessary under the —
QUESTION: Well, it doesn't need a rational basis to
cut the salaries of its own employees, does it?
MRS. LAFONTANTs

Oh, no, of course not.

But, in carrying it over to the States —QUESTION:

So that it wouldn't gain much weight

for the State, reduction in State salaries

out of -the fact

that they reduced them for federal: perhaps some but not

22
conclusive , would you agree?
MRS. LAFONTANTs

Yes, definitely.

And they wouldn't

have to follow,
QUESTION; Supposing, to follow up another one of
Mr. Justice Blackmun's question, that Congress decidas that
what we need to hold doxm are not just wages but spending in
general by States, and so they said that no State during
fiscal year 1975 could exceed its total expenditures for fiscal
year 1975 [sic] and there were findings 'that would pass the
rational basis test, that that would help in the exercise of
commarce power control over the inflation.
Now, do you think that's the end of the inquiry?
MRS, LAFONTANT;

No, I think — if 1 understand

your question correctly, I don't think Congress could set up,
in other words, the State's budget and say, and control it
completely and say that you can spend so much and no more.
QUESTIONs

You don't think, then, even tinder a rational

basis commerce power test that it could set a ceiling on the
State budget?
MRS. LAFGNTANTs

I don't.

X think we’re getting

pretty far — we’re getting to the question now of how far is
too far? and I think at that point I would believe we were
getting a little too far.

And it certainly gee's much further

than this case or Maryland vs. Wirtz.
QUESTION:

Perhaps Congress would try to accomplish

23
that in a more — that result in a more practical way, by
saying it would terminata all federal grants-in~ai& to States
unless States conform with a certain policy on budgets, and
get at it around Robin’s barn.
MRS. LAFONTANT:

I think even -that might cause --

be a problem.
QUESTIONt Some equal protection problems?
MRS. LAFONTANT:

It would be a problem; I would

think so.
Well, Senator Proxmire, in going further to show
that the States --- that the Congress really intended to include
the States, offered his amendment to specifically exempt from
the Act salaries of State employees.
responded .

And Senator Tower

— arid that's on page 15 of our brief , and the

Congressional Record at 117 —

Senator Tower said:

I don’t

believe it is fair to other employees to single out one
particular group for exemption; I believe the State and local
government employees should be subject to the same standards
as other employe© groups.
QUESTION: Where are you reading from?
MRS. LAFONTANT:

It's Senator Proxmire, 117

Congressional Record, 43673 and 43677.
QUESTION: And is it in your brief or in the Appendix?
MRS. LAFONTANT:
QUESTION:

It’s referred to in the brief,

I see the reference on page 15 of your

24

-

brief to the Committee*s Report.
MRS. LAFONTANTs

Yes.

That’s what it is.

QUESTIONS And that’s what it is.
MRS. LAFONTANT:

Yes.

I might add that the Proxmire amendment was defeated
by a vote of 56 to 35, so it's no question in cUr mind that.
Congress intended to include the States under this Economic
Stabilization Act,
And even beyond that, it's just inconceivable that
you would think that Congress would deliberately* exempt, say,
14 percent of all employees when we were in such "ah: "emergency
situation and we know what effect 14 percent of the population
would have on the rest of the nation.

But they Seem to make a

lot out of the fact that since States were not definitely set
'out in the Act, that it was intended to omit them.
But we have cases that show that, and Case vs. Bowies
is cue of them, that shows very clearly that just the fact that
you did not include the word "Statas" doesn’t mean that you
intended to exclude them.
Now, the only question that is really before the
Court, because, as 1 said, the three amici raised this and not
the petitioner, the only question presented in the petition is
whether Congress, tinder its corneae roe clause, constitutionally
may apply economic controls over the wages and salaries of
State employees.

25

Petitioners contend that if Congress intended to
include the States, then Congress is violating the Tenth
Amendment, the sovereign rights of the States.
And they go so far as to say that by doing this we"re
permitting the federal government to devour the essentials
of State sovereignty.
Whatever may have existed with respect to the power
of Congress under the commerce clause, to regulate State
activities, has been decided by Maryland vs. Wirta, where
this Court established the validity of this exercise of
congressional power in appropriate circumstances in inter­
state commerce.
QUESTIO??;

Of course, there that was a minimum

wage, wasn’t it?
MRS.LhPONTAHT:
QUESTION;

Yes, and overtime.

Here it’s a maximum amount.

I'm still

a little bit bothered if the Congress said to the State of
Ohio, You can pay your employees no more than $3.94 an hour,
what about those that had been getting $5 an hour, the
Governor himself, or something?
Could Congress do this?
MRS. TjAFONTANT:

I think on the rational basis test,

except for the -*■ you could even extend it that far, I would
believe; except that most times they do exclude the
administrative offices, like Governor or what-have-you; but I

2’
o

would say that once you would open the door, and if there was
this emergency and if there was a rational basis for it, and
in order to regulate the commerce among the States, and to
defeat inflation and fight unemployment, I think Congress
could actually do this.
But I -think it has to be done on a case-by-case
basis.

But I think in some instances it could be accomplished.
QUESTION3 Where did this rational basis test come

from?

I don't know if this is a matter of congressional

power under the commerce clause, and the other, and your
brothers talk about the Tenth Amendment on the other hand.
Rational basis is something that sometimes is used,
I think sometimes rather loosely and wrongly used in connection
with due process, and sometimes perhaps equal protection; but
where does rational basis come into this?
MRS. LAFONTANT; Well, in the cases that I have been
reading, even though there are soma Acts that say that you
don't have to shew a relationship, I would believe that the
courts would have the power to go behind the actions, the
decision of the Congress.
QUESTION;

Behind the judgment of Congress.

MRS. LAFONTANT; To go —
QUESTIONs To go further than saying that this is
within the commerce power of the Congress, but, nonetheless,
it's invalid because it lacks a rational basis; I don't know

27
of any case that holds that.
MRS. LAFQNTANT%

Well, it. wouldn't — but there are

cases that say that Congress —* X mean that the Court does
not have to accept the final say of Congress just because
they say it's within the commerce clause.
QUESTION: Do you think the taxing power and the
commerce power are -the same?
MRS. LAFONTANTs
same,

I ask this because 1 think ~~

No, I do not think it's the

And the cases ~~
QUESTION:

And why shouldn’t they be the same?

MRS. LAPONTANTs

— that may be — you’re asking me

why shouldn’t they be the same, or -QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MRS. dAFONTANT:

~~ if they are the same, the courts

have distinguished between the taxing power and the commerce
power.
QUESTION:

Thera’s no provision for the power to —

MRS* LAFONTANT:
different.

Right.

And they’re completely

The commerce power is plenary and goes much

further.
QUESTION: Well, the Constitution doesn’t say it’s
plenary.
QUESTION: The taxing power certainly can seek —
conferred in very, very broad authority, the power to levy
and collect taxes without any textual limitations, as I recall.

MRS. LAFONTANTs

But the cs.3& law has restricted the

taxing power much wore so than the commerce power.

The

commarce power is a much broader —'
QUESTION ;

Of course, this is the implication of my

question, as to whether there isn’t a limitation even on the
commerce power.

As I think you have more or less conceded,

there musr be some, although —
MRS. LAFONTANTt
stops.

Yes. But we don’t know where it

All we can say is that we know that this isn’t tha

case that would stop it.

And the cases have said that: -there is

a limitation on the commerce power.

But we haven't reached

that limitation, 1 believe, in this case.
QUESTION? The limitation is if it’s not commerce.
MRS. L&FQNTANTs
commerce?

Well, that’s pretty broad. What is

Because many -QUESTION;

Yes, that’s always a question.

MRS. MFOHTANT;

Is there anything other than the

collecting of your garbage that's not commerce?
QUESTION; Well, interstate commerce - I meaa, of course,
by commerce.
MRS. LAFONTANT: Right.
QUESTION;

Right.

Well, there’s little doubt that the total

amount of wages paid to State and local employees in this
country has an enormous impact on the commerce of the United
States, can there be?

23
MRS. LAFONTANTs
QUESTIONS

Oh, no doubt, yes.

Suppose, since we've gone quite fax

afield, suppose a State, hypothetically, decided to pay the
members of its Legislature $100,000 a year, and that same
Legislature was asking the Congress of the United States to
appropriate money for large grants to the State for highways
or dredging or whatnot, do you think there is much doubt about
the power of the United States to say that States who are
going to pay $100,000 a year to their Legislators —
MRS, LAFONTAHTt Right.
QUESTION;

— aren’t going to get the same treatment

on federal grants-in-aid as States who are more reasonable?
MRS. LAFONTANT:
about that.

I don't think there's any doubt

No doubt about it at all.

The thing that is still worrying me is the case I
wanted to find, which I can't find right now, on the point of
Mr. Justice Stewart’s question.
In fact, it's Mr. Justice Stewart's dissent in
Perea vs. United States.
QUESTION;

Yes, and that said that that was —

MRS. LAFONTANTs

No, that was the one that, had to do

with the loan-sharking, I'm sorry.
QUESTIONs That *s right.
MRS. LAFONTANT: Right.
But there are

30
QUESTION s

Thts censor of subversive literature ,

anyway,
[Laughter.]
MRS. LAFONTANT:

Well, as my

as my opponent

said in his reply brief, that it was obvious that we had not
read the dissent in Mary1and vs. Wirtz, because we had not
quoted from it, but he did, extensively.
QUESTIONi Well, Mrs. Lafontant, if what WS had here
were employees of private employers, doing exactly the work and
potentially receiving exactly the amount of wages' as these
employees, I take it that commerce clause, extent of Congress8s
power just measured by the commerce power would be exactly the
Same, whether they were private employers or State employers.
MRS. LAFONTANTs True.
QUESTIONS The rub comas from the fact that it may be
that Congress can’t exert the commerce power to the same
extent against States as it can against, private employers.
MRS. LAFONTANT: Well, there's no doubt about it,
yes, because of the Tenth Amendment.
QUESTIONs

You don't think we need get into that

region for this case?
MRS. LAFONTANT:

Ho.

I hope not.

I think --

QUESTIONS But isn't that what this case is all about?
MRS. LAFONTANT:

Well, let's say — no, this is not

what this case is all about.

It could be, if you reject the

31
argument that there is no other way out for the petitioners.
My main point is that you do not. even have to get
to the constitutionality of this Act and the Tenth Amendment ,
because of the pending injunction which I believe a motion
should be made to dissolve it, because the law has expired.
But once we get into the constitutionality of the
Act, the Tentli Amendment certainly is part and parcel of that
whole thing.
But I don’t see how, even in the Tenth Amendment,
how the Stats can really — Ohio can really argue that its
sovereign powers are being impinged upon, or that it's being
forced to cut back on certain services, or they have to
operate a certain way just because the salaries have bean
cut.
If we look at Maryland vs. Wirtz, there the State
had to pay out money, additional money to reach the minimum
wage.
In this case, the wages ar® cut back. The only thing
that you can really say that the State might be suffering,
and which they allege that they are suffering, when they say
that there is a disparity between State employees * salaries
and private employees8 salaries.
The Economic Stabilisation Act is saying we're
treating you both the same. So -the level of attractiveness
for employees remains the same. They are not being discriminated

32

against.
And both private and the State employees are treated
th© same.

So the only argument that I would think they would

have, is if — would be th© argument that they couldn't
attract employees or couldn’t keep their employees. But I
don't think that that can stand up.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you very much.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Brown?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN A. BROWN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BROWNs

tfes..

Thank you.

You know we have argued this matter now several times.
And X think this is the first time I have heard anyone for
the United States agree that there is a limit on the” commerce
power.

That’s comforting to hear.
Because we certainly agree with counsel, for the

appellee, that unless there is a limit on the commerce power,
then we may as well remove the Tenth Amendment, and it simply
does not mean what it says,
Now, Judge itosk of the California Supreme Court,
in the Co an y$. California case, said:

"Perhaps" 'the trend

toward centralised authority and judicial acquiescence in it
are irreversible? nevertheless I suggest that a fait accompli
is not necessarily desirable or constitutionally permissible."
Vie agree with Justice Mosk, and there was a great

33
deal of dialogue between the Court and me and the Court and
my delightful counterpart, in asking whether or not Congress
had done something — and I don't think the question is
whether they haci* but whether they may.

Because the question

that is before the Court* as indicated by Mr. Justice Marshall's
question* is that a year from now it may very well again coma
that federal wage and price controls may again be sought.
And again we will have the question of s

Are salaries of

employees of New York* Ohio, California to be limited again
as they purported to be in this last confrontation we had.
We believe that you cannot say to the State of Ohio *
under the Tenth Amendment* that your budget for 1975 may be
no more than five percent more than your budget for 1974.
And you may not say that

salaries for State employees are

required to be the same in ’75 a3 they were in "74.
Or that you may not say that salaries for employees
in *75 must be ten pereant less than they were in '74.
Because if you say that they can do on® thing, you must say
that they will do the other thing.
QUESTIONS

Do we not now, at present, under Davis-

Bacon* in effect say to the States* indirectly at least,
that you must pay the prevailing wage on any contract in
which there is a contribution by the federal government?
MR. BROWN:

Yes* but again that’s a different matter

than saving to the State of Ohio that you cannot pay tax

34
collectors, judges,, officials that have no counterpart in
private industry at all.
Now Maryland v. Wirt a made the point and made it vary
well , that there was a matter in competition with private
industry.

Davis-Bacon deals primarily with private industry

or at least jobs comparable to private industry.

We'*re not

— we're much further than that in this case.
Here we're talking about 100 percent of the jobs?
for the State Highway patrolman who may arrest me going home

He would be limited/ as would
And that’s much, much broader

than W1rfcz was.
QUESTION%

Does this apply to elective public

employees in Ohio as well? to Governor Gilligen himself, for
example?
MR. BROWN:
Constitution in

The Governor’s salary is regulated by

Ohio.

QUESTIONS And it was not covered by this wage
increase, was .it?
MR. BROWN: True.
QUESTION:

And on judicial salaries, it's the same,

isn't it?
MR. BROWN:

True.

QUESTION: They are separately covered.
MR. BROWN:

True.

35
QUESTION: And legislative salaries, the same?
not covered ■—
MR. BROWNs

In Ohio, yes.

Now, that may or may not

be true in other States.
QUESTIONS
MR. BROWNS
QUESTION s

Yes.

But in this case —

In Ohio, it is.
— elective officials were not covered by

this pay increase? is that correct?
MR. BROWN;

True.

Thank you very much.
m. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Brown.

Tnank you, Mrs. Lafontant.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2;52 o’clock, p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
