PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
first this morning in No. 9 Original,

We will hear arguments
United States against

the State of Louisiana.
Mr. Stockwell.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF OLIVER P. STOCKWELL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANTS
MR. STOCKWELL:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This case is now before the Court to determine the
coastline from which to measure the three geographical miles
that was confirmed to Louisiana in the Submerged Lands Act.
In 1969, this Court reaffirmed its prior position
in the California case that the
Sea would control in

Convention on the Territorial

determining this coastline and at that

time, there was appointed a Special Master, the Honorable
Walter P. Armstrong, and referred to him certain issues to
be determined preliminarily by Mr. Armstrong and report back
to the Court.
The report has now been filed'with this Court and
exceptions have been taken, both by Louisiana and by the
United States,
The first exception of Louisiana deals with the
fact that the Special Master failed to find any historical
inland bays along Louisiana's coast.

4
The Master first rendered a preliminary report in
which he found that there were no historical inland bays and
to that report we filed a motion to ask him to find special
findings of fact for the benefit of this Court* since he had
said that the evidence on Louisiana’s historical bay claims
was undisputed.
In the Appendix one to our brief is a motion that
we filed with the Special Master.
Now, that resulted in the Special Master making 16
special findings of fact which are attached to his report as
Exhibit ‘B.
Now, these findings of fact were made after the
Special Master had already determined that Louisiana had low
inland bays along its coast.
As we read the Special Master’s report, he is saying
that these bays along Louisiana’s coast would qualify as
territory bays and not as inland bays.
Now, we feel that the Master —
QUESTION:

That they qualify as —?

MR. 3T0CKWELL:

Territorial bays, historic terri­

torial bays and not inland bays.
Nov/, we feel that the Master made this determination
on the argument of the Government that only the exclusion of
innocent passage of foreign vessels was relevant evidence to
establish historically inland waters, even in a bay and we --

5
and now in this case, before this Court, the United States
is not defending that statement of law that they argued to
the Master.
They are saying that while that is an important
factor, that there are other relevant evidences that would
show that these waters could be territorial inland waters
and we say that these facts, it was found by the Master,
which included briefly that since 1870 Louisiana had been
passing laws regulating -oyster fishing along its coast.
In 1886, Louisiana passed legislation reaffirming
its title in all these bays which was shown on all the
published maps and these titles were reaffirmed in subsequesnt legislation.
Louisiana, the Master found that since the 1900's,
Louisiana had been leasing part of these bays for oyster
fishing and in the early 1900's, Louisiana had been enforcing
its game and fishing laws in these bays and using as a line
to demark these bays, the outermost mud lump or other
feature marking the seaward entrance Into these bays and
three miles seaward from that line.
And they were treating these bays as Inland waters.
They were patrolled by armed

vessels with armed [Inaudible]

They required anybody fisning in these bays to
buy licenses from Louisiana and the evidence shoitfs that
Mexicans, Spanish and various other foreign nationals

6
purchased licenses to fish in these bays and they also — the
Special Master found that Louisiana had closed seasons and
that these foreign nationals recognized Louisiana's closed
seasons.
In 1946, the Master found that Louisiana arrested
Mexicans in these bays and the arrest was made more than three
miles from any territorial —- three-mile territorial sea
within these bays.
Louisiana started leasing these bays for oil and
gas in 1928.
Louisiana passed pollution laws in the 19309s and
has enforced these laws.
And Louisiana has exercised and claimed jurisdiction
over these bays from the time it was admitted in the state
in l8l2 to the present time.
Now — and also the United States has taken an
interest in these bays.

Around the delta there v/as the Tern

Island Game Reservation Treaty by President Theodore Roose­
velt in 1907 and that was before you had any migratory game
laws.

•
Now1, we say that this evidence clearly indicates

that Louisiana was asserting to the world by these legislative
acts and the other acts that it was claiming these bays as
inland waters.
The Master found that Louisiana’s title to these bays

7
had never been questioned by the United States until IS48 and
in this Court — in its brief — the United States now
admits that it hasn't questioned Louisiana's title to Caillou
Bay as inland waters until 1968 and if this Court accepts
the Master's headlands for line A
waters in East Bay would have ben a

in

East Bay, then the

juridical bay till

1956.
Now, we say that the fact that the Government now
is not defending this position that you had to have direct
evidence of preventing innocent passage into these bays,
that a legal principle that they now say is what we have
argued all along, that you could show these acts against
foreigners to show that this water was an inland bay.
Now, also, \ve are arguing to this Court and we
feel that the jurisprudence supports it, that where you have
an indentation like a bay and you exercise jurisdiction and
dominion over that bay and establish it as a historic bay,
that it automatically becomes an inland bay.
Now, under Articles of the Geneva Convention where
they deal with historic bays and say that it is an exception
to the rules it is provided that any waters landward of the
closing line is inland waters.
Nov;, Dr. Blum in his book, which we cite in our
brief, discusses this very issue and says that there is no
distinction between the waters behind the closing line in a

8
juridical bay than there is in an historic bay.
Now, we feel like that one other issue that the
United States discussed in hearings before the Special Master
was that you had to have acquiescence of foreigners to these
acts — or foreign governments to these acts.
Now, in this Court, they don’t defend that legal
principle.

They say that you don't have to have acquiescence.
In another issue in the — before the Master was

the burden of proof.

They introduced evidence showing that

■che United States purportedly disclaimed any historic bays
along Louisiana's coast.
All of those Acts were after 19^8 when Louisiana's
title had already ripened, as we say, by these past acts and
anything that was done after that, as this Court has said,
could, not dispossess Louisiana of this title because it would
e an impermissible contraction of territory.
So this evidence was introduced before the Master to
urge that we had to prove our title to these waters which we
had treated as inland waters from the initial statehood beyond
a doubt which is almost the same evidence you'd need to have
in a criminal case.
Nov/, in -chis Court, they don't defend that principle
-Uiey say that now you don't have to have that burden of
proof.
Now, we feel like that — that in the United States

9
also argued before the Special Master, that there were no
waters along the Louisiana coast that were at one time in­
land waters that would not now satisfy the juridical test.
Now, of course, that is not true notv, because they
admit that East Bay at one time was a juridical bay to its
outermost headlands in 1918, which would be to Line A and
also admit that Caillou Bay was inland waters.
Now, they were making that argument to the Court,
to the Master, to keep him from having to decide whether
Louisiana — what title had already been invested by past
events, whether or not the Government could dispossess
Louisiana of that title.
And we say that where these bays had been inland
bays and recognised as inland bays by the United States
until after the Submerged Lands Act, they remained inland
bays.
Now, they argue, too, that the fact that these
bays were once inland bays — or the waters were inland
waters — that shouldn't be — is [of] no importance in
determining the historical character of these bays, even
t hough Louisiana showed that it exercised enough jurisdiction
of dominion prior to these bays ceasing to be juridical
bays if they have — already don't meet the test and has
continued to exercise that authority.
They say that immediately — that a bay would

10

Immediately lose its juridical characteristics.
Say you had a sLight change In the headlines, a
slight change in the

water area, that the United States

would lose thousands of acres of land and you could not
acquire that as a juridical — as an historical bay to exercise
jurisdiction and dominion for a period normally to acquire
historical title whether you had any prior inland waters or
not.
Now, we say that that is certainly not — has no
basis for that.

They have shown no area in the world where

you have had bays that have been treated an inland bays that
are now open sea and they also — Mr. Miller, who represented
the United States at the Hague Conference in 193° urged that
where waters were once under the dominion of a state a,s inland
waters and you remained -- and you kept jurisdiction of them,
that they remained inland waters and this was in keeping with
the arbitration case between Norway and Sweden in the Grisbydonna case where they say that a state of facts of law
existed ‘in international law that disturbed

vdry little and

we say that it doesn't affect ambulatory questions of the
Coastline.
The ambulatory feature of the coastline is pri­
marily related to that part of the coastline that is in direct
contact with the sea.

Now, this is changed by erosion and

accretion but where you have large bodies of water such as

11
bays and straits, that this — that that principle doesn’t
necessarily apply.
Noxtf, we had Dr. Bouchez come over from the Nether­
lands and testify in this case and that was his opinion.
The United States argues that if they would adopt
the evidence that we have introduced in an international
court, that the international court would not say these were
inland waters.
We had Dr. Bouchez come over here and he listened
to all the evidence and we propounded to him a hypothetical
question similar to the evidence in Exhibit B that the
.Master found and asked him what an international court would
determine the waters over which these acts had been taken
and he said they would be internal waters under the regime
of historic bays.
Nov;, we feel that his opinion should have consi­
deration by this Court.

He is a recognized authority of

which this Court has recognized him as an authority.
The same — so we feel that Louisiana has proven
that these bays are historically inland waters and that
therefore the closing line of the bays should be, as
Louisiana has indicated; there is no dispute, as we under­
stand, between the Government and us as to the closing lines
if this Court would hold that the bays of the Delta — now,
the only bays that are involved — Mr. Justice White, do you

12
have that map — is around the Delta and at Caillou Bay.
Now, these are the bays that \ve say are historical
bays.
Now, at this time, unless you have some questions,
I9d like to ask Mr. Ellis to talk on the juridical question.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Ellis.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK W. ELLIS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANTS
MR. ELLIS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please
V

the Court:

■

Y

In addressing the juridical problems of whether
particular bays along the Louisiana coast qualify as bays
and whether the limits are located as contended for by
Louisiana or as contended by the United States, the principal
legal authority involved is Article VII of the Geneva Conven­
tion on the Territorial Sea which this Court, in its 1969
Louisiana boundary decision, held must be applied to the
Louisiana coast.
QUESTION:

Mr, Ellis, before you proceed, may I ask,

am I correct In my understanding that the map that has been
put before us this morning is identical to the map that ivas
the Appendix to the Court's opinion in the case to which you
just referred in 1969?
MR. ELLIS:

I understand this Is correct, your

13
Honor.

This was put before you by the United States and we

are satisfied it is corrects, sir.
QUESTION:

That It is the same.

MR. ELLIS:

Yes, and they offer some explanatory

QUESTION:

They have made some marks in red here,

details.

I noticed.
MR. ELLIS:

Yes, sir, they have marked, for

example — there is one little detail, the Coast

Guard line

that shows an extensive water area.
QUESTION:
MR. ELLIS:

Right.
Runs outward to sea considerably.

That is no longer In controversy.

Originally there was

20 million acres in controversy In the case.

It has now

been reduced to approximately 258,000 acres.
QUESTION:
MR. ELLIS:

I understand that.
The areas in controversy are the

Mississippi Delta areas numbers 1, 4, 5 and 6 and Caillou
Bay, number 7 which are affected by the historic claims and
the remaining areas numbered on the map are affected by
juridical c1aims.
Additionally, much of the area affected by histori­
cal claims is affected by juridical claims.
For example, East Bay, number 1 on the map, is the
subject of both historical and juridical claims.

14

QUESTION:

Right.

MR. ELLIS:

Now, turning to —

[QUESTION:

Inaudible.]

MR. ELLIS:

This shows the historic bay closure at

the artificial entrance point and this shows Line A employing
the outermost extension of the natural land form at the base
of the jetties on the headland, the pronounced headland at
Southwest Pass.
QUESTION:
MR. ELLIS:

Right.
Incidentally, this Court/ in its 1966
.

' Tf

decree in the California case,in passing upon headland
questions, noted that where there is a pronounced headland,
the natural entrance point would be selected by using the
outermost extension of the pronounced headland.
We have fundamentally three kinds of problems in
the Bay areas in controversy.
Related to the elements of the bay definition which
;4

your Honors can find in Appendix A to the United States brief,
the original brief. Article VII requires that bay be a wellmarked indentation with such penetration in proportion to
width of miles as to contain landlocked waters and constitute
more than a mere curvature of the coast.
Additionally, it requires a semicircle test.

We

maintain that there are basically three elements involved.
One, the well-marked element which relates to the

15
identifiable headland requirement this Court required in

1969.
Secondly, the landlocked element governed by
depth of penetration in relation to width of miles which is
the N and M landlocked of mere curvature.
At Ascension Bay, the first of the geographic areas
in controversy, the controversy turns principally around the
landlocked issue.
QUESTION:

What number is that?

MR. ELLIS:

This is number two, your Honor.

Your Honors may find this bay also in a map which
was prepared to implement your ruling that islands should be
counted as water area,

Figure R-A in Louisiana's reply

brief found at page 58 which map has superimposed upon it,
in black lines, a sketch showing the outline of Monterrey
Bay.
Monterrey Bay is a bay along the

California coast

which this Court decided in 1965 was well-marked, was land­
locked, did have identifiable headlands.
Now, the Court decided in 1969 that islands within
an indentation should be counted as part of the area of the
indentation even excepting Government arguments that to be
counted, one area had to be part of the area of the indenta­
tion.
The Court referred to the Master then, two issues,

16
the well-marked question and the landlocked question.
During the testimony in this case, Dr. Hodgson, the
geographer of the Department of State, testified that
Ascension Bay was well-marked, his disagreement with the bay
being accepted as enclosing iniocked waters was based solelyupon the landlocked issue.
However, as we' demonstrated to the Special Master,
by comparison to the Monterrey Bay map, a mathematical data
by measurement experts, geomorphological experts.
As we demonstrated by comparison to Moray Firth,
by comparison to Egmont Bay, by comparison to bays that
Dr. Hodgson himself had recognized along the coast of Alaska,
this bay was, by any comparison, subjectively or objectively
landlocked.
For example, it had a depth of penetration 50 per­
cent greater than the depth of penetration ratio of Monterrey
Bay.
It is rather interesting to note in

this Louisiana

environ that bays are formed by the natural bank or natural
levee systems of the Mississippi River or its distributaries
or its former courses.
At this locale, it is the former course of the
Mississippi by Isle La Fou'che on the left or the west side
of the drawing, the Mississippi on the right with Southwest
Pass which forms the pronounced headlines which well mark the

17
indentation.
Turning to East Bay, similar land forms —
QUESTION:
MR. ELLIS:

Is this one?
This is East Bay, your Honor.

QUESTION:

Right, that’s number one.

QUESTION:

That’s one.

MR. ELLIS:

That is number one, your Honor, on the

Government location map.

It is Immediately to the east of

Ascension Bay.
We have, again, these pronounced headland forms.
Dr. Hodgson, incidentally, in his testimony here recognised
that these — and he is the geographer for the Department of
State . that these landforms t^ere, indeed headlands, that
they were, indeed, identifiable headlands.
His only quarrel with the headlands were that they
did not relate to this bay but related to pocket bays.
We demonstrated, however, by an objective test
that he said should control over his own opinion, that it
satisfied this objective test and consequently we also
satisfied the Master on that point as well as using a number
of other technical tests which satisfied him fully at all of
the alternative line claims of Louisiana.
The Master found that each of the alternative
juridical claims withinthis bay was well-marked, was land­
locked, had clearly Identifiable headlands.

18
He required actually a stiffer burden of proof
than this Court asked for when it required that there be
identifiable headlands and found they were all clearly
identifiable by use of the technical test» photographs,
overflights and a mass of map data and information.
There is no time to cover the various alternative
contentions which "were thoroughly considered by the Master in
this area.

The principal problem here turns on area measure­

ment, area measurement under the semicircle test.
It is Louisiana’s contention that the letter and
spirit of Article VII should be followed in requiring the
area for the semicircle test be measured by following the
low water line and additionally, that islands Within the
indentation

be counted as part of the area.

This is consistent with the ruling of an eminent
British trial jurist who considered the same problem in the
Thames Estuary which, like this area, contains tidal streams,
tidal rivers and he held that the history of the Convention,
the letter of it, required that every stream, every river be
counted and he counted all of them and he found that the line
in controversy there satisfied the semicircle test by so
doing this.
We submit that the precedent of the British decision
in this Thames Estuary case is very well-reasoned and should
be followed by this Court also.

19
The only substantial question then is whether he
was correct when he decided that tributary waters should be
excluded.

The Government would draw a distinction and say,

well, some tributary v/aters should be excluded and others
should not.

This is a change In their former position.

They would say, well, perhaps rivers or streams
should not be included in area measurements.
Let us note right now that we did not, in any of
the measurements submitted by experts —■ the mathematics
of which, incidentally, were not challenged at all -- we do
not claim any part of the Mississippi River passes — these
passes — as part of the area measured.
The system our technical expert recommended was to
use the tributary waters to the point where they ceased to
be tributary to this bay.
Gulf of Mexico and thus ad

The passes were tributary to the
absurdum arguments to the effect

that one could by this system go to Canada simply have no
application under the recommendation of our technical expert.
Dr. James F. Morgan.
QUESTION:

When you say "pass,” that refers to the

water rather than the land, doesn’t it?
MR. ELLIS:

Yes, sir, now, generally speaking,

"pass" means "Southwest pass," for example, would be the
water but this term is sometimes also applied to the natural
bank or natural levee system that — that bounds the land.

20

So that I am not referring to Southwest pass wafcerbound in
the
East Bay. I am referring to/Southwest Pass natural levee
bounding or vie 11-marking East Bay.
QUESTION:
MR. ELLIS:

All right.
Incidentally, this problem should be

distinguished in this area of counting islands from problems
of headland selection in connection with islands.
You will hear the Government contend that islands
within an indentation should not be counted because they
should be treated as part of the mainland.

land, that this was done after considering that the Convention
language did not deal with the problem but in this instance,
the Convention language is explicit and it is not merely a
matter of technical language, it is a matter of the spirit and
of the reason for the rule for there is explicit legislative

history, for example, we have an Appendix, Appendix one wh^re
we deal with the International Law Commission history among
many, many other items in that technical appendix where vie
point out that Mr. Francois, the rapporteur, mentioned —- of
the International Law Commission whose work led to the Geneva
Convention — mentioned that the rule required islands to be
counted as part of the az’e'a of the indentation, did so
because of the fact that the

islands tended to link the ares.

21
with the land law.
This is a reason for counting and being liberal in
the question of area measurements not a reason for being
restrictive in the method of area measurement.
Similarly, islands at the mouth of bays, they
have found that this tends to link the water with the land
law and the more one links the water with the land, the more
reason there is to treat it as in the water and this is just
antithetical to the Government notion that one would assimi­
late islands to the mainland for purposes of water measure­
ment under the semicircle test.
Turning to the other major category of problems,
island headland problems — oh, but before discussion of
those, let me point out one other problem.

Government would have the Court rely upon instead of the

presented to the Master.
Numerous errors and deficiencies which we feel we
must bring to the attention of the Court lest the Government
position go unanswered that one can form an opinion on the
basis of there mere sketches.
For example, at South Pass, the Government sketches
leave off the islands that form the tip of Line A»
QUESTION;

What is the status of the Government

22
sketches so far as the record is concerned?

Were they

admitted in evidence or are they concededly just illustrative?
MR. ELLIS:

They were not admitted in evidence.

As

I appreciate it, they are merely illustrative.
Similarly, in the illustration, however, there are
departures from the evidence because we had, in the Joseph
Bayou area, this landbound area here, considerable evidence
of the land deteriorating until it reached a condition like
this map which is submitted as illustration only but is a
public map of the United States Geological Survey recently
published.
This area here has disintegrated and we show ample
photographs, for example, at page 82 of our opening brief
following, to show this state of deterioration
QUESTION:
MR. ELLIS:

Is that the Joseph Bayou area?
Yes, these are shown at —• close-up

photographs at page 82 and 83 and this map made with the
hydrography for the low-water datum — and the hydrography
includes' the low-’^ater line shows that this area is substan­
tially identical to the streams and island situation within
West Bay which I am pointing to now, which this Court held
did not separate

Riverside Bay, Zinsen Bay and Bob Taylor's

Bond.
Incidentally — excuse me, sir?
QUESTION:

No, you go ahead.

23
MR. ELLIS:

All of these areas were counted as

part of the Outer Bay-Ascension Bay, which is out here —
would be approximately out here -- and the Court held that
these were islands within a bay and that they and the areas
covered, which, incidentally, include streams, do not prevent
the use of those areas as part of the area of the bay.
We feel the Master fell into

error of a legal sort

in connection with island-handling problems for we think he
misinterpreted the Court's opinion where it set out factors
for determining whether islands are realistically part of
the mainland as requiring cumulative rigid tests or require­
ments.
For example, this is an area in the Mississippi
Delta where we have in the headland situations substantial
fluvial conditions.
For example, at Southeast Pass, which is the sub­
ject matter of illustrations in the Appendix numbered one to
our opening brief, one can find — I direct the Court’s
attention to figure 33 found at page 266 — mudlumps claimed
by Louisiana -- these are unique local names for these
highly-elevated islands, mudlumps.
They are found at a very short distance, approxi­
mately two miles from the mouth of Ballize Bayou where the
arrest of a vessel, a privateering seizure, occurred in 1806.
This was the subject of the British Admiralty

24
Court decision. The Anna, in which an American Ambassador
appeared in the British Court and. made, T. submit, an historic
water — an historic bay claim here because these — really,
this Court found itself were islands that were an extension
of the mainland in The Anna and these are almost at precisely
the same locale.
We had a geologist testify they had precisely the
same characteristics as The Anna facts and, indeed, there is
some reason to suspect that they may even be the very same
islands that were involved in The Anna.
The distances involved ’were relatively minor but
very significantly, as this exhibit shows, there was less than
a foot of water separating these islands from the mainland.
This is typical of all of these floating islands along the
Louisiana coast, the very exceedingly shallow waters.
As -far as innocent passage is concerned, for
example in this area, one couldn’t get one of our local
pirogues through this area, or one would need an airboat to
get through this area, the only kind of navigation that can
be done but yet, the depth and utility of the intervening
waters which this Court said was a factor to be considered,
while considered, was not given appropriate weight, we submit,
by the Special Master.
These are situated on extensions of the natural
levee.

If ever there was a geological natural levee extension

25
of the mainland form, this is it.
An eminent

geologist testified to these islands

being continuations of the physical mainland geologically in
this connection being formed

just as the Anna mudlumps were

by sediments, as the Court in that case styled them and by the
weight of sediment upthrusting them.
The distances involved are minor,if one examines
figure 35 at page 270 of our Appendix, compared to the
assimilation of islands that was done in the case of the
Spanish Banks by Judge Maris in the Florida matter pending
now before this Court.
Turning to -- oh, before leaving this Mississippi
Delta area, I wanted to bring the Court's attention to this
illustration from material in the record that shows that the
headland — this is the
went through.

example of the kind of detail we

There is much more for all of these others,

too; that where we show that the — this was the outermost
extension of the natural form --- the natural landform in
1901, the headland used for Line A on the west and that over
time v/e traced it — for here, example, the jetty that was
left off the Government sketch is shown on this reproduction
of the chart of that period and line A strikes that jetty
at its base,

showing that it is the terminus of the natural

lane which we selected as the natural entrance point.
Now, this shews this on a snore modern map.

26
In the Caillou Bay region,, area number 7, again we
have

an

example of fluvial islands,islands which were the

subject of geomorphological testimony to the effect that they
are the remnants of a former Delta of the Mississippi River.
They had formerly been solidly connected to the

In the last century this island was solidly
connected to the mainland and it was really a peninsula.
The Master, incidentally, ruled with us here that
he, on the basis of even a strict test he took to applying
the Court’s standards, that he found that this island situation
posed a situation where the island should be treated
realistically as

part of the mainland.

He felt deterred by this Court’s footnote comment
that we had not urged this ourselves and that the Court did
not think so but of course the Court at that time did not have
a full record for it, did not have the evidence.

This is the

very reason this Court appointed a Master, wa3 to discover
such information as the fact that these were fluvial islands

found mainland marsh deposits on these islands,

Government points to as a deep channel but it is merely a
hole — one sounding is 23 feet between these, on the whole,
less than five foot.

A vessel drawing more than five foot of

water could not navigate through here.
In this area, for example, this largest of the
island openings — C, your Honors, in location C here the
water depth is less than a foot.

There is a picture in the
a
record of myself and my daughter out there taken by/technical

witness hung up with a 20-foot Mercury outboard motor cannot

Turning to the sise considerations which the Master
deemed important, he found it a fact here that we had islands
that on the whole — and your Honors can see this — are
larger, are greater in distance than the water gap openings
and data i” not needed, it is quite evident graphically.
We failed to footnote comments which was perhaps
occasioned by the graphics of the Government brief which
showed an extremely small-scale sketch.
We have tried to point out in our brief that smallscale sketches can be misleading accidentally and that it is
necessary to consider the Convention requires the large-scale
charts.
We, incidentally, have a great many other arguments

29

that selectivity of time needs have required us not to
elaborate upon but of course we do not waive them, such as
the chart matters where we have maintained that Cowhom
Island for

line C which the Master found existed until 1969,

that this should control.
We persist in these arguments and merely mention
this so it will not be misunderstood that we are waiving any
of these claims.
Incidentally, a number of the headland claims are
supported independently by the application of ordinary head­
land rules as well as island assimilation rules.

It will be

recalled this Court mentioned In passing that rules for head­
lands apply to islands and we have a number of headland
rules that are applicable.
For example, in the Islands at Southeast Pas3 we
looked at, which are substantially similar to other islands
in the Mississippi Delta that are claimed as bay headlands,
we haven’t argued all of these locations In the interests of

[?]
time, they form the apex of the Salians, which are the
natural banks of the rivers here.
Some of these other islands are a good deal closer
than the Southeast Pass mudlumps to which I direct your
attention particularly as at Bucket Bend Bay whei'e they are
very, very close.

Others are more distant as at Pass Salute,

but all of them have this unique fluvial character present in

30
this Mississippi River Delta of very, very shallow water.
The deepest water found between the islands in the
Mississippi Delta is water of four feet, and this is at Pass
Salute.
Generally the water between the islands is less than
one foot, mere inches, a child, a five-year-old child could
walk out to these islands.

That is how shallow the water is

and, incidentally, out at the exterior headland islands that
we are claiming, the land out there is very substantial and
firm because you receive sands there but in the interior
portion, in the Joseph Bayou area, the land in here is very,
very insubstantial, very marshy due to the differences in the
geologic conditions associated with this.
L?
Thrs area has become nothing but mere smallbank
remnants' which we maintain ought to be treated technically as
what they are, islands.

point to in the Special Master’s report are almost exclu­
sively errors of law, a question of the correct method for
applying the semicircle test, a question of did he require
the correct standard of proof when he required that head­
lands be clearly identifiable — clearly identifiable, not
merely identifiable but clearly identifiable.
Did he require — apply the correct rule "when he

about for two pages in its opinion.
Even in the face of this, if one fact defies, a

these mudlump islands, he denies their use as headlands.
We submit that this was a misinterpretation legally
of the Court’s.

the Government would ask to reverse the Special Master’s

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS F. CLAIBORNE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
I’ll attempt to deal first with Louisiana’s historic
claim.
I approach it in this and I siiugest it is proper
for the Court to approach it with a bias against finding
historic inland waters.
I say that because it seems to me there is a. pre­
sumption against such historic waters

that do not conform

to the rules of international law or the rules of convention.
To find an historic bay

where there is no juridical

bay obviously encroaches on the first

principle of maritime

law, which is freedom of navigation, freedom of the seas.
Secondly, It delegates from the rules of the

33
International Convention which tell us how to define a bay,
if every time an area which looked like a bay does not
satisfy the technical criteria established by the Interna­
tional Convention it could be claimed as historic
the convention would become a dead letter.

waters,

It would serve

no purpose.
One must be hesitant.

One must be reluctant to

find a bay where the rules of the Convention say there is
none.
Thirdly, to find historic waters on the American
coo

contradicts the consistent and very longstanding

tradition of American foreign policy which is to view
restrictively, narrowly claims into' the ocean.

That has

been the position of the United States in its foreign
relations ever since the days of Thomas Jefferson.
And, finally, in these particular areas, East Bay
and the rest, it is of course relevant that the United States
has taken the position that these are not historic waters.
And it has taken that position not for the purpose
of this litigation solely, but quite consistently in its
international stand with a view to foreign relations.
There can be no claim in this case that the
Government has taken one position where oil is involved and
a different position where international relations are
involved

34
At all stages of this case, the Justice Department
and the State Department have been in consultation and have
found a. uniform position and, indeed, the position —QUESTION:

But it is also quite an unusual one.

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Indeed, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

And I may say — or perhaps I shouldn't — that we
have sometimes been in the position of having to bow to the
geographer of the State Department.
QUESTION:

Is this a -- your basic theme, here at

the onset, that there is and should be a presumption against
finding historic bays?

Do you find any support for that in

any of the opinions of this Court?
You gave us the four reasons of the Support you
think your assertion of that bias or preseumPtion —
MR. CLAIBORNE:
QUESTION:

I think —

— but is there any support

for that

±n

either the Louisiana Boundaries case or in the United States
against California or anywhere else that you know of?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Only to this extent, Mr. Justice

Stewart, that in both of those cases the Court took note of
the federal disclaimer arid gave it weight.
In the California, case it was said that such a
disclaimer would be conclusive in the absence of overwhelming
proof that such a claim had right.

Nov/, let me say straightaway that notwithstanding a

35
I have said about a presumption against historic waters, we
recognise — as we must in light of the Court's opinion in
this very case in 1969 — that if historic title had
ripened to any of these areas before a federal disclaimer
was made — and we take that to mean before 19^8 when the
first of these suits x^ras filed, then it would be curtailed,
but one must be hesitant to make such a finding, not only
because of the encroachment on American foreign policy, the
awkward situation that would result in having this Court
say, "This is a bav," the State Department saying, "It isn't
inland xfater," but the international considerations which
view historic waters as an exception — and my opponents were
free to say that this was an exception to the normal

rules

of Article VII 3^3 I think they must be right in this respect.
QUESTION:

But that still, all of that, still
l

doesn't add up to their being a bias against them or a pre­
sumption against them, does it?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

I certainly wouldn’t say there

ought to be a bias against Louisiana, Mr. Justice Stewart -QUESTION:

Well, just historic bays.

That was

your —MR. CLAIBORNE:

Well, I suppose the normal rules of

construction would say that when the claim is — attaches
it sell, to an exception «o the rule, that exception ought to
be construed narroitfly.

36
Now, perhaps that is a different way of saying
that there is a presumption against finding such an exception,
QUESTION:
bays,

There are a good many recognized historic

aren’t there, along; the coastlines of the United.

States?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

No, Mr. Justice Stewart, the

United States — and I should say this -— consistently with
.its position of restricting the coastline as much as possible,
of limiting the encroachments on the open sea, recognizes on
the American coast no historic bay whatever with the single
exception of Long Island Sound and that is in the record
through letters from the legal advisor of the State Department
and, indeed, from the Secretary of State to the Attorney
General.
That is the traditional policy- of the United States.
Other countries take different views but here we are talking
about the American coasts.
QUESTION:

■

-■

Tested by the rules of an; International

Convention.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Tested by the rules of the Inter­

national Convention which merely recognizes in Article VII
that there are such things as

historic bays without

attempting to define them, presumably because of lack of
agreement

in

the national community on the subject.

Now, bearing in mind what must be recognized as a

37
heavy burden — if only because of the federal disclaimer -and here the Court has been clear that the disclaimer puts
the burden on the state claiming the historic waters, has
Louisiana proved any historic title to East Bay or any of the
other areas.
Now, this Court has already said there are three
elements which require proof as to each of which the state
has the burden„
The first is that there has been an exercise of
authority over the area which indicates a claim to that area
as inland water, not as territorial water but as inland
water.
My opponent said that the Master had found that
East Eay was a historic territorial bay and that is simply
not the fact.

On the contrary, the Master explicitly found

that issue the other way.
He discussed whether Louisiana's evidence was
consistent with the use of the waters as territorial waters,
there being, of course, the three-mile territorial belt.
He also adverted to the possibility that one could
obtain territorial water title to an extended belt but his
conclusion — and that conclusion is quite explicit — is
■chat the issue which has been presented by Louisiana, is
there a territorial — are there territorial waters in East
Bay?

He says the answer is no.

Now, that is made perfectly clear when one looks at
the report on page 56.

The paragraph six

says "Erom. South

Pass to Southwest Pass , East Bay."
Subparagraph E — I've got the wrong one.
Page '56.

I'm sorry, I was -- "Does this area

include"-— now this is paragraph E on page 56, "Does this
area include any historic territorial waters under principles
of international law, particularly at Isle auBreton Bay, East
Bay or West BAy and, if so, what is the effect?"
"

Ke answered that question and that is issue 1(e) on

pa.ge 22 of hrls report where he

said, "The Special Master is

constrained to make a similar finding in the instant cases
and therefore 1(e) and so forth must be answered in the
negative."
Now, we come to the second element which is the
continuity of the exercise ofN^ufchority- over the waters
* "

indicating that they are inland character which, quoting from
a U.N. publication, Juri'dicai Regime, which this Court
invoked in its last opinion, "Musi; be so long continued as to
have developed into a usage."
And, finally, and very important is the acquiescence
of foreign nations,
I heard it said a moment ago that the United States
had taken the view that acquiescence was not necessary.
What we have said is this:

Acquiescence is

39
necessary but it may be explicitly expressed or it may be
tacit,

Obviously, if the evidence were that foreign govern­

ments had, over a long period of time, been notified of a
claim to inland water and had taken no action,

made no

protests, and had obeyed the restrictions imposed, we would
c oncede, even though there had been nothing expressed, that
this amounted to acquiescence.
QUESTION:
escence in some form

It would be tantamount to --

What authority do you have that acqui­
is essential?

MR, CLAIBORNE:

The authorities cited by this

Court in its last opinion indicate that either express
acquiescence or absence of protest is important.
When absence of protest is discussed, it is in a
context of having notice and we simply refer to that situa­
tion of not protesting when you have had long notice as
amounting to a type of acquiescence.
It seems to us to be a debate about words and not
a real debate, whether one says -QUESTION:

So you wouldn’t —-if it is just a

debate about words, you wouldn't insist that acquiescence Is
unnecessary.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Except that I would insist,

Mr. Justice White, that absence of protest alone is not
sufficient.

One must show that the foreign government had

repeated and over a long period notice of the claim.

QUESTION:

Well, if the foreign government hasn't

invaded Louisiana, that would be an official acquiescence
then, wouldn't it?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

It would be enough if a foreign

government had been notified, over a long period, that
Louisiana was claiming East Bay as inland waters and had
failed to protest such situation — provided, further, that
they had some interest in doing so.
Well, one can't draw a conclusion if there is no
reason to go into East Bay.
Now, what is the evidence that Louisiana has
presented come to?
I think it is fair to boil it down to really two
claims.

The first is that over some period it has exercised

fishing regulation within East Bay and perhaps some adjacent
areas, including in that oystering and shrimping.
And, secondly, if invokes its mineral exploration
and leasing in East Bay and in Caillou Bay.
Nov;, when we get down to looking at that evidence,
what do we find?
With respect to fishing first, any fishing or
fishing regulation or exclusion of foreign vessels within the
three-mile territorial sea proves absolutely nothing relevant
to this case because as a matter of international law it has
always been the prerogative of the coastal state to exclude

41
foreign fishermen within that territorial sea or to regulate
foreign vessels or to recall them to take out licenses and
pay a fee.
Indeed, even as a matter of domestic law it has
always been the prerogative of the states, within constitu­
tional limitations only, which is to say the Commerce Clause
and the Privilege and Immunity Clause, to regulate fishing
within that marginal belt of three miles and even the
California case which said the states don’t own the belt, did
not take away from them the right to regulate fishing,
provided, it was done in a non discriminatory way vis-a-vis
other U. S. citizens.
And, indeed, the Court so held in Toomen and Hitsell
Of course, since 1953, the Submerged Lands Act has
clearly confirmed the rights of the states to regulate fishing
within the three-mile belt.

So nothing can be made of the

activities within the three miles.
Beyond three miles it is, of course, settled by
early decision of this Court,

Skiriotes versus Florida, that

regulation with respect to its own citizens indicates no

claim.
Wow, what about regulation of foreign fishing or
exclusion of foreign fishing beyond the three miles?
Even that may amount to

no more than the claim of

a wider territorial sea than three miles and, indeed, during

'42

all of this period, Louisiana was claiming a much wider
territorial sea.

It was 27 miles between 1938 and 195^ and

it was nine miles between 195^ and I960 when this Court's
decision c ame down.
And as a matter of international law, one is free,
under the Convention, to claim as much as 12 miles, which
would cat up all of the area of East Bay, if one took 12
miles from each side.

The basic opening is approximately 18

miles, the widest opening.
Now, alternatively, regulation of foreign shipping
or foreign shrimping or fishing or exclusion of their boats
beyond three miles may amount to no more than the claim of
a contiguous fishery zone, beyond the territorial sea, very
far from a claim of inland water.
That is precisely what the United States did in
1966 by Act of Congress.

It claimed a nine-mile zone within

which it" can exclude foreign fishing or regulate it or both
and other nations throughout the world have done the same.
Indeed, in the I960 opinion of this Court in this
case, the Court noted that for fishing, among other purposes,
nations had, for hundreds of years, created belts of juris­
diction off their coasts and the Court referred in that case
co a tabulation which had been made during the Senate hearings
in 1951 in reference to the Submerged Lands Act legislation.
I had lodged with the Clerk for the Information of

the Court, should the details be of interest, three tabula­
tions of claims made in the world community of fishing zones
that exceed the territorial sea.
One is from the Senate hearings to which the Court
itself referred in the I960 opinion.

One is from the i960

edition of Shalowitz, x*;hich has been referred to by the
Court and by the parties.

And the last is the most recent

State Department publication published in 1974 which,
incidentally, shows that no less than 36 nations have
fishery zones, either excluding foreign fishing or conserva­
tion areas which go well beyond their territorial seas and
which are obviously not intended to imply any claim to inland
waters, indeed, not even to territorial waters.
I conclude, therefore, that the fisheries regula­
tion would indicate no claim to inland water here and that is
on the assumption that there is some real evidence about it.
The truth of the matter is that we have a series
of acts of the legislature entirely inconsistent and contra­
dictory, some placing a three-mile belt within East Bay and
everywhere else, some an 18-foot line or three fathom line
which is always within, landward of the three-mile belt, in
East Bay, at least and. some of them apparently claiming East
Bay on a — what is called a point-to-point basis between
the two levees.
The evidence as to tile way in which these statutes

were actually implemented is also most ambiguous.
First we know that no oyster lease was ever granted
more than three miles from shore.

As to fishing and shrimping,

there is evidence that for broken periods there was a. patrol
that ran from one end of the Southwest jetties to .the end of
the South Pass jetties but it is perfectly clear that that was
not a consistent practice.
What it meant, even when it was used, is not clear.
At times, the 18-foot line or the three-mile line
were used Instead.
So we have, far from a long continued» consistent

\

usage developed on the issue of enforcement, even assuming
that such a policy would prove a claim to inland waters.
As to the exclusion of foreign fishermen, when you
look at the depositions on which those allegations are based,
you

discover that most of them, in fact, lived locally, for
•V

all we know, were citizens.

V. ' . .

In any event, they seemed to have
i

,

been permanent residents of Louisiana and the notion that their
acquiescence in these x’ishing license regulations got back to
China or Japan or Spain or the Phillippines Is most unreal.
Anyway, they agreed to buy the $5 fishing license
or shrimping license and it turns out, when one looks at the
record, the place they seem to have wanted to fish most was

46
And the 18-fathom line — the 18-foot line is shown very
clearly and as I represent to the Courts always well within
our three miles from the shore of East Bay.

I don’t — I am

not clear where It might be elsewhere.
Now, perhaps I ought to turn to the claim based on
mineral exploration.

That can be dealt with quite shortly.

I have heard nothing about it this morning but
Louisiana’s brief makes much of a lease granted in 1928 which
can be construed as covering all of East Bay and all of West
Bay and a great deal more.
It is clear in the record that the only map
accompanying or relevant to this lease, which is, in fact, a
release dated in 1937, shows that the oil company to whom the
lease haa by that time been assigned found unusable — and
therefore released ■— any portion beyond a certain boundary
an,!.,, cnat boundary happens to be pretty much the three-mile
' limits well inside of it at places,generally following it.
It is therefore perfectly clear that there never was
a.ny exploration much less any production from any lease
granted by the state in East Bay before 1947 and, indeed,
when the case was last here, Louisiana dated its claim based
on exploration from 1947,

Only in this proceeding has that

been changed.
By 1947, of course, President Truman had claimed
lor the country the entire Continental Shelf and other nations

seeing operations more than three miles from shore, would
not have cared or known whether this was done under the
Presidential Proclamation or because Louisiana treated the
waters as inland.
It is also relevant that, as soon as their drilling
began in 1947, the United States filed suit against
Louisiana and has consistently challenged those operations.
Indeed, the Chaplin Line In East Bay, which was meant to
carry out this

Court’s decree in 1950, follows the three-

mile — follows the contour of the coast and in 1955 this
Court was required to issue an injunction against Louisiana
to prevent the drilling in the East Bay.
It would be a very strange irony If, by acting —
if, by prolonging this lawsuit for so long, Louisiana were
to be able to establish an historic claim to inland water in
East Bay Invoking the very activities which have always been
in dispute since 1948.
Mow, on the historic claim, I think I need say no
more.

It Is clear that there are no unequivocal actions

Vi.aich Indicate a claim to these waters as inland rather than
as territorial or as contiguous.
There is no consistent pattern which could reason­
ably be called a usage and there is no indication whatever
that any foreign nation was ever notified or ever had come to
Its notice any of these claims that Louisiana now asserts.

48
In.those circumstances, the absence of protest is
meaningless,
We, therefore, think the Master quite correctly
rejected the Louisiana historic claim.
I turn now to the juridical claims advanced by the
state and first to East Bay.
Mow, we take what is characterized as a simplistic
approach here and suggest that you look at this area without
any lines on it and reach an impression

and that is all

these matters come to ™ whether this qualifies as a wellmarked indentation enclosing the landlocked waters.
I think one has to note first the general shape of
that triangle.

sea that it is Very difficult —

getting a sense of whether it is a bay or not?
IIR. CLAIBORNE:

Well, I don't think quite that

Simply but that is the beginning.
The Master’s conclusion is not based on any
technical expertise.

There is no way technically that one

can decide such a matter and when one looks at how the

think that line encloses landlocked waters.

QUESTION:

Yes,

MR. CLAIBORNE:

— the semicircle test was

QUESTION:

All right.

MR. CLAIBORNE:

But you never get there until you

first look at an unmarked map.
QUESTION:

And find the *— mark the indentation.

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Well', I would say that, Justice

Stewart, you do it this way.
QUESTION:

You look at the map.

Yes.

MR. CLAIBORNE:

You say to yourself, now, does that

look like a bay or arguably a bay?

It may be, in the case of

the East Bay, the answer is yes.
You then ask yourself, where are the natural
entrance points to that bay and this Court itself, I think,
in the last opinion, concluded the natural entrance points
are the tips of the two jetties.

That seems to be the

boundary' of the bay.
Louisiana makes an argument about, that is not
natural because it is an artificial jetty but I take that
argument to have been foreclosed by the previous opinion.
It happens that, once you test that full bay under
the semicircle rule, it doesn't satisfy.
found in 1959.

This Court so

51
Now, the Court — Louisiana said last time, vie
recognize that, but we can draw a line ~~ a very artificial
line — inside which will satisfy the test.
This Court responded, ah, you can't go about it
that way.

You have got to find that there is a geographic

bay, not one that mathematically satisiles she test.
We followed that approach.
The Court said, there may be a bay, a narrower, a
smaller bay within East Bay.

We are not saying there is.

We

are not saying there is not.
The Master, I think, misunderstood» ©r at least he
seemed to take the view that he must assume that there was a
bay somewhere in there.
There must

be a bay.

After all, it is called "East Bay."
My job is to locate it.

I think he also assumed that any line which
satisfied the semicircle test was, at least presumptively,
good enough to meet the juridical test of the Convention.
Now, it seems to us that that is going about it
backwards.

He should have first said to himself, now, if the

whole thing doesn’t qualify, is there, in fact, anything else
that is a separately-defined bay within East Bay?
And when you look at the two shores, which are
essentially straight, there is nothing that jumps at you as
the natural entrance point of a smaller bay arid that is not
surprising because when you are dealing with a triangle of

52

those dimensionsj more relevantly, with an angle at the top
which exceeds 65 degrees, it is mathematically impossible to
construct an interior bay which satisfies the semicircle test,
if it were a perfect triangle.
Now, first, East Bay is not a perfect triangle.
QUESTION:

Mr, Claiborne, may I ask, looking at that

map, what is the significance of that line below numeral 73?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

That is just meant to indicate that

the 73 relates to the measurement of the angle, Mr. Justice
White.
QUESTION:

That is the degrees of angle, isn’t it?

MR, CLAIBORNE:
QUESTION:

That Is the degrees of angle.

Well, now, where --

MR, CLAIBORNE:

The formula Is that if the apex of

the triangle exceeds 6'5 degrees, no way can you draw• a line
that use's that same angle as a form that satisfies the semi­
circle test?
QUESTION:

Where within what is marked as East Bay

did the Master say there existed a bay?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

QUESTION:

I know. '

MR. CLAIBORNE:
Mr. Just.ice Brennan.

Wall, we have an exhibit that —

— that would indicate it,

Court to look at the map unmarked to think to Itself, where
would we put that line?

Now, the Master said that — he didn’t go about
It that way.
two lines,

Louisiana suggested to him, among many, these
The United States said, we concede that those

lines meet the technical semicircle test but we dispute that
you’d have ever found them if they hadn’t been suggested to
you.

And I think that is the way it ought to be thought

about.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Well, which one did he find?
For a period until 1969 — I think

it is December, 1969 — he found the outer line, which is to
say line C.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Re found that thereafter the

anchor for line C on the east which is labeled Cow Horn
Island had ceased to exist and therefore he bad to find
another anchor and the next one was the one to the north
which supports line D.
We say Cow Horn Island didn't exist for any of
this relevant period and therefore line C must fall on that
ground alone,

I will not burden the Court with the reasons

why we think the evidence does not support Cow Horn Island
for the period 1950 to the present and we’11 rely on the
brief for that proposition.
QUESTION:

But now your point Is that those are

not headlands or what?

That those are not natural entrance

But those bays are within East Bay.

QUESTION:

And so there may be a bay Within a bay.

MR. CLAIBORNE:
QUESTION:

Those bays are within East Bay.

Indeed.

Indeed, we -—

Even though the bay in which the one bay

occurs isn’t a juridical bay.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Indeed, Mr. Justice White.

Our

point is this, that these — this coast is essentially straight
and that to pick out points on it is artificial.
QUESTION:

Would you concede that some'where up in

the — would you concede beyond that line of A?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

affect anything.
QUESTION:

geographer of the State Department who drew a line somewhere

And first we concede that this is

We concede that there is a bay in here.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. CLAIBORNE:
QUESTIONS:

We concede that this is a bay.

With all these concessions you are

suggesting, these have nothing to do with this over here,
these islands.
MR. CLAIBORNE:
QUESTION:

It so happens that they do not.

What do you mean precisely when you say

the natural entrance point to a bay?

Are you talking about

somebody hiking around the shore?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

I think one must look at it from

the point cf view of a mariner, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, who i
entering and he says to himself, I airs now within inland
waters.

I have left the open sea.
QUESTION:

But you don't enter, certainly, at the

point closest to shore as if you are entering the bay?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Well, it is perfectly true, if one

might more logically enter at the center.
QUESTION:

Well, you would hope so, wouldn't you?

MR. CLAIBORNE:

But in this ca.se, when you can

see both shores, the distance not being great in the case of
line D.

But in this case —
QUESTION:

But when it comes to waters, it is

something quite different.

That is when the inland rules of

56
the road take over and so on and that has nothing to do with
bays.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Well, the internal waters, the

Inland waters —
QUESTION:

A mariner, a navigator of a ship has

to know when he is in inland waters and that is actually the
Coast Guard line.
'

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Well, but using --

And that has nothing to do with whether

or not you are in a bay.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Using inland, Mr. Justice Stewart,

in the Sense in which the Submerged Lands Act uses inland or
internal waters in the sense in which the Convention uses
internal waters —•
QUESTION:

But inland waters is a term of art

having to do with the rules of the road for mariners.

It has

nothing to do with whether or not you are in a.' bay, whether
you are in a bay or not.
MR. CLAIBORNE:'

But Mr. Justice Stewart, this Court

has used the term inland waters as the grant states — this
Court has said — begins the seaward limit of inland waters
and it is that use as inland, waters that I am talking about
and for that purpose, the waters within the juridical bay are
inland waters and the waters outside that closing line, even
though within the Inland rules of the road, are not inland

57
waters for the purpose of this case.
QUESTION:

Yes.

But the many inland waters, you

are In inland waters many, many times when you are not In a
bay and nobody thinks you are in a bay.

You are still in

inland waters.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Yes.

But in answer to Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, I xtfould say that one has to be able to determine,
whether it is from a plane or from a ship or from the shore,
that one has ceased to be in waters that appertain to the
open sea and have reached waters which are landlocked which
are Internal which are defined by headlands, preferably
pinch headlands and which therefore are —
QUESTION:

Isn't it the purpose of a convention

to enable you to make that sort of a definition?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Exactly.

The convention helps us

in that It tells us that such a closing line must be between
natural entrance points.
must be well-marked.

It tells us that the indentation

It tells us that the line must be such

as to enclose land-locked waters.
Beyond that, the convention does not help us.

We

must use our own. judgment in interpreting those terms and
applying' them to any concrete situation.

But I say to this

Court that the members of this Court are just as able to do
imat and it, is done on a flat map «— has nothing to do with
any special information that might not be available.

One just looks at the map and makes a — an

QUESTION:

Well, are We offering coletractors

to

conference on Friday and try to figure this thing out for
ourselves?

I would think In order to assess a Special

Master's' finding on this, you would have to make some attack
other- than — we do it a little differently,
MR. CLAIBORNE:

But I did try to say, Mr. Justice

Rehnquis’t, that I think he began from the wrong starting
point, followed the wrong path and therefore reached the
wrong result and I think his wrong starting point was to
assume that his job was to find a bay somewhere within East
Bay and, secondly, to rpesu'me that when the technical semi­
circle test was satisfied, one Indulged a. kind of expectation
that so were the other tests.
QUESTION:

Well, if you —

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Whereas this Court has very clearly

a1d you oegin the other way in light of the convention.
QUESTION:

But he did hunt for headlands, apparently,

MR. CLAIBORNE:

He considered headlands suggested to

him is more fair, Mr. Justice Stewart.
QUESTION:

Well, that may be so but he didn’t just

.say, at any point along a smooth coastline I can mark the
beginning of a bay just because that is where the bay
satisfies the semicircle test.
i>.r, CuAIBORNE:

Well, I certainly don't wish to

59
overstate the Master's decision.
this

Of course he recognizes

Court has said you can’t draw an arbitrary line any­

where which merely satisfy —
QUESTION:

Actually, you are looking to Article

VII of the convention, aren’t you, where this definition is?
MR. CLAIBORNE:
QUESTION:

Indeed.

Indeed.

Yes.

MR. CLAIBORNE:

And Article VII begins by telling

you what is a bay and then as a second check, it imposes the
semicircle test in case you have gotten a bad Impression.
But you must first find a bay before you use the
protractor.

You never get to the protractor until you have

found what looks like a bay and what Is not merely an
artificial construction.
I would say that what has happened in this case
is that Louisiana last time quite candidly said, we are
drawing an arbitrary line that meets the semicircle test
which, incidentally, I’d like to show you,^to show you where
It was.

And this time they said, oh, well, we’ll have to

get little pan pricks on either side to support that
mark.
artificial, equally artificial line.
QUESTION:

And the Special Master rejected

Louisiana's arbitrary —

QUESTION:

Right.

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Indeed.

Now, it is interesting to

60
note where that line is.
QUESTION:

They purported to follow your rules,

You

may disagree with them.
MR, CLAIBORNE:

Well, I — I don’t know about —

well, I suppose the Master purported to follow my rules but
he did not articulate it that way.
He said, let's look at line D and then said, oh,
well, it has got enough of a headland on the left and enough
of a headland on the right.

He.didn't ever say to himself,

rnow, is there really any bay within this bay?

Suppose I

weren't helped by the parties, where would I find it?
QUESTION:

ft looks like a bay to me, all right..]

m' CLAIBORNE:

I point out that the 1968 line is

rt. mark ably inlana and. that was the best line Louisiana could
und in-1968 that would satisfy the semicircle test.

Only

now have they developed a new rule for- semicircle measurement
and talked about the deterioration of Joseph Bayou.

Now,

issues that were perfectly available to them in 1968.

1 think one must view that approach with some
guarded suspicion.
The other lines' shorn), on this last overlay are
Louisiana's various suggestions
QUESTION:

the most —

Wait a moment, what is the nautical-mile s

distance on the line he finally found?

MR. CLAIBORNE:

D.

That is B, isn't it?

61
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. CLAIBORNE:
QUESTION:

I --

Looking from here it seems It would be

about five —
MR. CLAIBORNE:

It would appear to be approximately

four and a half nautical miles.
New, I cannot, in the little time remaining, go
through our various objections to each of these lines.
1*11 say one word about this new method of going
up rivers to include waters so as to satisfy the semicircle
test with lines further seaward than either C or D.
The United States concedes that C and D meet the
semicircle test properly applied.

Louisiana would have you

overturn the Master in this respect and find B or A by
using upriver waters first, invoking an English decision by
a single judge who is not affirmed in that respect by the
English court of appeals.
I'll say no more about that.
And secondly, by taking notice of what they claim
to be deterioration at Joseph Bayou, a matter as to which
they v/ere not free to do because they had not reserved the
right to do so in 1969 when they stipulated the correctness
of the

maps which is before this Court, indeed, was

before this Court in 1958 ~~ and which, in any event, is
insufficient to treat all that land area as water.

62
Louisiana waxes hot and cold about what are
islands and what is mainland.

When it serves their purposes

areas very far detached from lend — like all these mudlumps
are treated as assimilable to the mainland.
When there are little ribbons of water separating
large chunks of land, they somehow become true islands and
therefore to be treated as water for semicircle test purposes
1 think it will be transparent to the Court that
that inconsistency cannot prevail.
QUESTION:

Mr. Claiborne, has there been much oil

exploration seaward of line C or D?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

There has indeed.

There has been.

But you must remember, Mr. Justice Brennan, that that is the
beginning point for the three-mile belt and therefore what we
are tale]_ng about is not line C as such but a projection
three miles seaward from line C.

That would be- the award to

Louisiana if line C were upheld or if line D were upheld.
QUESTION:

C would be the equivalent of the low

water mark basically and you would work it out from there.
MR. CLAIBORNE:
QUESTION:

Indeed.

Exactly.

Well, this bay now — we are now trying

to determine the coastline and Louisiana owns three nautical
miles out from the coastline.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

That is right and the coastline is

defined either as the low-water* line along an open coast or

63
as the seaward limit of inland waters in a bay —
QUESTION:

Yess it is really only the latter that

causes all these problems,
MR. CLAIBORNE:
QUESTION:

And it is only the latter —

The latter part of the definition.

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Now, there are issues.

Our second

exception deals with the existence or non-existence of an
extension of lowtide area off Pass Isle Bois which is more
a question of where the low water line is.
I do not argue that here beca'use~it is a minor
issue and tends more on the facts.
I had best get to Ascension Bay if I expect to
say anything about it at all.

Here again, we take the same

approach.
That is, we suggest to the Court that the proper
approach is one

of looking at the general area and saying

to oneself, now, is this a bay at all?
Here there is no question about which part of it
is a bay.

The question is whether any part of it is a bay.
It seems to us that we have here a half-moon in

which a 42-mile opening to the sea with no possible indica­
tions of where the open sea begins and where inland waters
or internal waters or the bay itself begins.
QUESTION:

Two.

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Indeed, number two.

And the

Government’s chart, Louisiana dislikes the use of small-scale
charts, gives you a reasonable impression of Ascension Day
as compared to the entire coastline and whether one ought to
view it as more realistically part of the sea or as a separate
landlocked area we say that it is simply not landlocked.
Now, again the Master, I think, was influenced by
this Court's findings that Ascension Bay met the semicircle
test and he thought that was a goad in the direction of
saying therefore it is probably a juridical bay.
There is very little indication how he reached his
conclusion because he did it all in three sentences.

He said

that the bay had well-marked natural entrance points but was
very reluctant to identify "them.
He said that it was almost perfectly semicircular
in shape, the classic shape for a bay.

He said that it had a

startling resemblance to Monterey Bay, which this Court had
found to be a bay in the California case and we think each of
those statement's is false.
Where the well-marked entrance point on the west is
baffles me.

It has baffled Louisiana, who shifted it about

to several places, and it has baffled the Master, who has
chosen one and said there may be many more and had to be
pressed into chosing the first because it was much easier to .
leave it vague.
It seems to us one can’t do that.

If this is a

65
well-marked natural entrance point, a necessary predicate
for a bay, it ought to be identifiable.
We see none.
The two possibilities seem to be, one at Bell Pass
Jetties.

Louisiana doesn’t use the jetties because they are

not natural.

They are artificially made.

And the only other one that occurs to us is as

[?]
coming out of here, both ending on the tip of Susqus Jetty
which does indeed look like a well-marked natural entrance
point.

It is the problem on the west that we speak of.
Now, it -QUESTION:

[Inaudible] the Master's dine?

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Chief Justice, the Master

suggested that one line was the red one.

He suggested there

may be others, not telling us which they might be.

We

presume chat his decision is based on the red line though
he was — let me hasten to say the reason why this could be
I

left in the air is because, the bay being overlarge, the
rules of the convention require that a 2'4-mile arbitrary
fall-back be drawn and is so happens that that fail-back
line ■— and the parties are agreed about where it would be —
starts here and goes somewhere in this direction so it
doesn’t matter whether you stop there or there.
QUESTION:

Let’s assume the Master -- assuming

the Master was correct in calling this an oversize bay, then

66
the parties are in agreement as to where the 24-mile —
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Entirely right, Mr. Justice white.

QUESTION:

I see.

I see.

QUESTION.

Well, let’s see, if the Master sustained,

what remains to be done to locate the actual lines, anything?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Nothing remains to be done if the

Master is sustained.
QUESTION:

If the line has existed or •— you say

there is no bay at all.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

We say there is no bay and we say

that because the point on the west which has been chosen, if
the belt has jetties, doesn’t begin to define that inward
curve that one would expect to

find for a bay.

On the contrary, it comes out.
not concave.

It is convex and

It is just an arbitrary starting point.

Now,

ic can't be seen as anything else, or so we submit.
Now, the other point, on the face of It, seems to
have a little more to recommend it but It is really nothing
More than che headland for Caminsda Bay.
the mariner or anyone else.

It doesn't advert

This is a huge bay to the east.

It tells you, we are about to go into a bay.
Caminada Bay, the other entrance of which is the island to
wle east

actually, not the island because this whole

complex Is one — Barataria Bay-Caminada Bay — so this is
quite obviously a bay but when you get to here, to realize

67
that there Is a huge bay to your right is not realistic.
Now, the Master also said it was almost a perfect
semicircle.

It is that close but substantially incorrect.

If one drains a semicircle on either of these lines, one
notices how much land has to be eaten into before the semi­
circle of water is satisfied.
The only reason the bay satisfies the semicircle
test is because this Court held in 1969 that these waters
can be thrown in but in terms of perfect semicircles, there
is all of this of land.

There Is ail of this of land,

showing that the depth is not even that of the semicircle.
Now, the statement that

a

semicircle is the

classic form of a bay is a gross exaggeration.
minimum for a bay.

It is the

The classic form of a bay is more like

a sea shape, with a pinch'er, with something that tells you
that you are now entering internal waters, something which
does lock the waters inside the closing line.
There is nothing here which makes the1 waters on
one side of the line more landlocked than the waters on the
other side.
QUESTION:

You mean, In order to meet the initial

test of a well-marked indentation, it has to haye that sort
of configuration?
MR, CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Justice Stewart, I would say

to meet tne combined test of having a well-marked indentation

68
that encloses landlocked waters.
When one puts those two phrases together, I think
one expects to find the classical form, at least, would be
a pineher.

A semicircle will satisfy the test but this is not

a semicircle because it doesn’t even come in on the west as
a semicircle would.
Now, when one compares Monterey Bay, which is a
pincher, one sees what a classical bay does Indeed look like.
There is no question where the natural entrance points to
Monterey Bay are,

They are two headlands facing each other

and the waters behind are lying connecting them, quite clearly
are landlocked waters.

One knows that one is within a bay

and has left the open sea.
What is more, Monterey Bay is only 19 miles wide.
This bay is 42 miles wide.
We suggest that when a bay is overlarge, there is
all the more reason to require stronger indications that one
has left the open sea.

One can’t see across this opening.

Therefore, there ought to be stronger pinchers that cut off
ocean from the waters inside is one is going to reach
ohe conclusion that these are truly inland bay waters.
I have time for one word with respect to Caillou
.

The short answer there is piiat this Court has already

resolved that issue in 1969.
There are enough' issues in this case without this

69
Court's being tempted to accept the invitation to reconsider
that ruling.
What the Court said in 1969 was that neither did
Louisiana claim nor was it a fact that the Isles Dernieres
were assimilable to the mainland but that they were, on the
contrary, islands.
The Court’s other holdings, which were that islands
can never form the entrance to a bay and that you don't push
out a line for the purpose of including islands unless it is
a bay to

begin with, and here there is very truly no bay

If you don’t anchor it on the islands.
This area would never qualify as a bay unless one
used this as a closing anchor.
Now, here we have Caillou Boca, about a third of
a mile, about 14 to 15-foot depth and a marked channel, a
clear separation from the mainland.

There is no serious

debate that this is an extension of the mainland.
What’s more, as I say, the Court has already
resolved the issue.

Louisiana says, ah, but the United

States until 1968 conceded that these were inland waters
which is true.

The Court in 1969 said that the Government

is not bound by that concession because Louisiana has suffered
no prejudice from it.

On the contrary, It has just received

revenues through oil exploration to which it may not have
been entitled.

70

Louisiana says, we were prejudiced because this area
wasn’t surveyed as carefully as it might have been if that had
been at issue.

But the years that have passed since 1968 and

the present have offered ample opportunity to the state to
make any --to present any further evidence if there were
useful evidence to present.
They did not even reserve the right to do so when
they stipulated the maps.
in any event, they have done so and the new evidence
doesn't change the picture.

It doesn’t narrow the gap between

the islands and the mainland, the relevant gap being Caillou
Boca.
In all the circumstances it seems to us that the
Master’s gratuitous invitation to tie Court ~ naturally
supported by Louisiana -— to reconsider its ruling with
respect to Caillou Bay ought to be declined.
Now, I have

v

sought to say to the Court that this is

noi/ a technical matter and that the Court ought to view it
freely yf.» t,hout being burdened with the suggestion that the
record is overwhelming and that special expertise is required.
I suggest the Master’s report be confirmed in all
respects except in his finding at East Bay, his finding at
Ascension Bay and his finding with respect to Pass du Beds.
QUESTION:

Do I understand you to say that only Long Island

71
Sound has been — is an historic bay on the United States
coasts?
MR. CLAIBORNE:
Blackmun.

That is the fact, Mr. Justice

It appears in two vjays.

First, that is the

representation of both the legal advisor and the Secretary
of State in documents on file in this case.
Secondly, it appears if one looks at the charts
which have been circulated, which have been published and,
at the request of some foreign governments, circulated to
them, delineating the entire three-mile coast of the United
States and there it would appear that Long Island Sound is
the only case where one claims a bay that does not meet the
juridical test.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF OLIVER P. STOCKWELL, ESQ.
MR. STOCKWELL:

Well, in connection with the

question of Justice Blackmun, I think the United States
recognized Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay as historical hays
In addition to Long Island Sound.
As a matter of fact —
QUESTION:

They

meet the juridical bay

requirements, though.
MR. STOCKWELL:

I think they do now, yes, sir, but

I think before that they were recognized before they had the
24-mile closing line.

They were recognized as historical

bays.
As far as Long Island Sound is concerned, the
United States , through the State Department, furnished
information to Mr. Griswold to answer Interrogatories in the
Alaskan case and said there was some

question about whether

Long Island Sound was a historic place and later Mr. Meeker
wrote Mr. Griswold to correct those answers and said he had
an
found out that there had been/agreement between New York and
one of its adjacent states fixing a boundary in the bay which
was approved by the United States and therefore they consi­
dered if a historical bay and they said there was no question
of any dispute about it.
Now, that was the only thing that was said about it
They didn't say anything about jurisdiction and physical

73
dominion or not.

It automatically became a historical bay.

So life feel that with the long history of action that
Louisiana has taken along these bays,, along its coast, and
that there has been no — even though the United States said
the evidence is not all that clear., but the Master found
that they had enforced these laws.
Now, 'when they talk about the fishing, there is a
recent case filed with this Court just before the Original
in which the United States filed a suit against Texas and
Florida to enjoin Texas and Florida from enforcing its
fishing laws more than three miles from the coastline.
This suit is pending now.

In other words, the

United States recognized in that court, in that case, that
they permitted foreign nationals to fish three miles beyond
its coastline and that the states had no right to prohibit
the foreigners from doing that.
Now, of course, we recognise in *66 Congress
passed an act creating the 12-mile fishing zone.

We

recognise they had a convention on the sea and natural
resources at the same time they had the convention on the
territoritory of the sea and continuous zoning.
But wo are talking about in 19-48 'when Louisiana
says its title was vested by these historical acts.
There was no permission to fish beyond the threemile territorial sea and it was Louisiana enforced those

74
rules within its bay that they were asserting jurisdiction
against foreign nationals beyond the territorial sea and
certainly would be asked to establish historical waters.
Now, Mr. Claiborne didn't discuss the fact that
these bays were recognized at one time as inland bays.
*

Now, as a matter of fact, the Special Master in

East Bay, he found that the line A that you saw on
Mr. Claiborne's map and the line B met all of the requirements
of Article 7 of the Convention but he said that it did not
meet the semicircle test when you used his rigid water measure.
But the Master realized he was wrong so he found,
those lines and said to the Court that you might take a more
liberal view of water measurement and if you do, these lines
meet objectively those tests arid we say that under the
convention and the prior ruling of this Court in the Thames
Estuary case, that the Court should take and include the
waters of these streams that are tributary to the bay.
Nov;, this exhibit that the Government put which
was a diagram which was a diagram — and certainly they are
entitled to put the diagrams up there -- it doesn't show all
of the wafers entering East Bay from South Pass.

It doesn't

show the waters' entering the Bay from Southwest Pass or none
of the Johnson By area [Joseph Bayou area?]
QUESTION:

Mr. Stockwell —

STOCKWELL:

Of course, all that makes a

75
difference when you look at that bay to see if you can find
headlands or you can consider water area.
Nows the map that indirectly -- and these are the
maps that the Court attached to its opinion — shows a more
realistic view of East Bay.
Nov/, Mr. Armstrong gave considerable attention
to this case.

Ke gave us all plenty of time and he worked

and listened to all of the evidence and on all of these
points, these headlands points, there was distinctive
evidence on it.

There was — it located them.

There was

expert testimony and we say that what the Government is
attempting to do — and Louisiana is not attempting to do —
we are not trying to upset its findings of ,-faet — we say
legally and he realized that was a legal question is whether
or not he used the proper area measurement and if you
disagreed with him, he had fixed these lines.
Now, he designated Calllou Bay.

He said that he

realized that in the ruling of this Court in prior briefs
there was some question of whether it was admitted that these
islands were not assimilated to the mainland.
But he said that if ~ from the evidence in this
case that was produced before him that he would say that
Calllou Bay i/as a juridical bay, that it met all of the
tests.

These are the rigid tests that he set down with

reference to the assimilation of these islands to the

76
headlands.
Now, there is a difference between assimilating
islands for headland purposes and islands in a bay to be
considered water area.
The fact that islands are in a bay might be
assimilated to the mainland doesn’t make them nevertheless
an island for the purpose of water measurements because in a
bay it is considered that that whole area is territory.
In other wordss there is no difference between the
land and the water.
Now, the assimilation of islands for headlands,
thei’e is a question there of whether this island is assimilated
go

the land,

Now, whether an island is an actual island in.

the bay or whether you would say that island is assimilated

\-o the mainland and you couldn’t use it for water, that is
not the test.
test only applies when you use an island as a
headland for the bay.
Now, that is what Mr. Claiborne was arguing.
Now, we say, your Honors, that we feel that
Louisiana has adequately proved all of its — all of these
waters as being historical waters and I want to make it clear,
i/e are not asking this Court to treat Louisiana specially.
Arl we want is what the facts of this case and the law would
give us.'

77
We realize that this is an important ease and the
decision that this Court makes on these issues of historic
bays and on other Issues dealing with the convention are
going to be precedents in these other cases and in inter­
national law and we say that the Court

we urge the Court

to look at the case carefully and resist the effort of the
United States in trying to restrict the territory of the
United States.
Thank you., gentlemen.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Stockwell.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 12:00 o'clock noon, the case was
;ted and a recess was taken for luncheon.]
