E.£°ceedings
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 73-1513, United States against Jenkins.
Mr. Frey, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FREY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case is here on a grant of the petition of the
United States for a writ of certiorari to review a decision
of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second circuit,
which dismissed the government's appeal from an order of the
District Court

in this case, which in turn dismissed

respondent Jenkins' indictment for knowing failure to submit
to induction into the Armed Services.
This case is related to the next case, which you
will hear, United States against Wilson, both involve the
issue of whether the United States may appeal constitutionally,
consistently with the double jeopardy clause, from a posttrial ruling which would be denominated an acquittal under
the definition in Jenkins.
The Wilson case also involves the further issue of
whether the ruling there was an acquittal for purposes of such
a rule, if the Court were to adopt such a rule.
Now, the pertinent facts surrounding Jenkins'

offense, as disclosed by the evidence at trial and as specifi­
cally found by the District Court, are undisputed.
Mr. Jenkins v/as ordered on February 4th, 19 71, to
report for induction on February 24th.

The validity of that

order, as initially issued, is unchallenged.
Mr. Jenkins received that order.

He wrote to the

Local Board thereafter, requesting a form on which to apply
for conscientious objector classification.
On the day before his induction, he went down to his
Local Board, again to pick up this form; at that time he gave
them a brief written statement of his conscientious objection
claim.

At that time he was told that his induction order

would not be postponed and that he should report the following
day.
On February 24th, 1971, he failed to report for
induction.
These findings ware all specifically made by the
District Court,
Now, it's the government's position that these
facts required, as a matter of law, the entry of a judgment of
conviction against respondent Jenkins.
However, the District Court concluded that because
these events took place prior to this Court's decision in
Ehlert, and because at the time of these events, in the view
of the District Court, it was the law of the Second Circuit.

5

that the; Local Board was required to postpone respondent
Jenkins’ induction and to consider his claim of late
crystallising conscientious objection, it would be unfair to
apply the Ehlert principle to the defendant who was before
the District Court.
QUESTION:

In this case, it is a case in which

the respondent Jenkins did have a counselor whom he consulted?
MR. FREY:

He did.

Yes.

QUESTION: Was that man a lawyer or not?
MR. FREY: The draft counselor, I believe was not
a lawyer.
QUESTION: But he presumably had some expertise with
respect to the law of Selective Service?
MR. FREY:

I don't know, it’s not in the —-

QUESTION:

Or else he wouldn’t have been a very

good counselor, I suppose.
MR. FREY:
QUESTION:

It’s not in the record.

Presumably.

And therefore, presumably would have

known the law of the Second Circuit; right?

Wasn't that part

of — some of the reasoning of the case?
MR. FREY:
speculative.

Well, that’s — but that's sheerly

I don’t — that was not a part of Judge Travia’s

QUESTION:

But if you go to a — if a person has a

doctor, for example, you assume, the doctor knows something
about medicine, just by definition.

If you go to a counselor,

6

a draft — a Selective Service counselor, you assume, almost
by definition, if he is a counselor, unless he's a fraud and a
charlatan, he knows something about Selective Service law,
don't you?
MR. FREY:

Well, yes.

QUESTION:

It doesn't need to be in the record.

MR. FREY:

But —* well, I don't know whether this

Court could take judicial notice of it, but I think that what
the District Court held was that, with respect to people who
at that time were ordered to report for induction, when the
law of the Second Circuit was as had been held in the Geary
case, it would be unfair to apply Ehlert retroactively.
Now, that's a question of law, and that's a question
of law which was decided in favor of the government in a case
called Mercado, which was then pending on appeal in the
Second Circuit.
Because of the conflict between the two cases, the •
Solicitor General authorized an appeal in the Jenkins case.
And as the Court of Appeals decision in Mercado
clearly establishes, the District Court here was in error in
dismissing the indictment, and the respondent was demonstrably
guilty and he should properly have been convicted.
However, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals
never reached the merits of our appeal; rather, it held that
the District Court's action, although labeled a dismissal,

7
was in fact an acquittal as the concept was defined in United
States v. Sisson.

While the Court of Appeals recognised that

amended Criminal Appeals Act would authorize the government's
appeal if the Constitution permits it, it concluded that this
Court’s decision in Ball, Kepner, Fong Foo, and Sisson
prevented it, the Court of Appeals, as an inferior court
from allowing the appeal in this case.
Although there is some suggestion that Judge
Friendly felt that these holdings were suitable for recon­
sideration by this Court.
Now, the issue in this case may be simply stated?
Doss the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment bar
government appeal from a post-trial decision of the District
Court terminating a prosecution in favor of the defendant,
where such a decision is an acquittal under the definition of
the concept in Sisson, if the appeal raises only issues of lav;
and if a reversal would not require the defendant to undergo
a second trial?
Now, the constitutional question of the appealability
of a legally erroneous acquittal, where no second trial is
required, is, surprisingly enough, in view of its importance,
a matter of first impression before this Court.
I will, later in my argument, show in detail why
this is so with reference to the four cases relied upon by
Judge Friendly.

8
QUESTION:

Isn't Fong Foo on that point?

MR. FREY:

No.

As I — I’ll get to it later, but

briefly Fong Foo is not on point, because what it prohibited was
an appeal where retrial would be required.
QUESTION: That was a legally erroneous acquittal,
wasn’t it?
MR. FREY;

That's true, i mean Fong Foo establishes

the proposition that there may be circumstances in which a
legally erroneous acquittal is not reviewable.

But it was not

talking about the circumstances of this case, because in Fong
Foo the trial had never been completed, and you really were
in a Somerville-Perez type of — interrupt a trial situation
ending in an acquittal.
It's perhaps close, in some ways, to Jorri.
The reason why this is a question of basically first
impression today, in 1974, is clear when you look at the
history.

At common lav; and under the holding of this Court

in the Sanges case, the government had no right of appeal in
criminal cases, in the absence of a statute authorizing such
appeal.
And then in 1907 Congress passed the old Criminal
Appeals Act, and it was construed in such a manner ultimately
in Sisson, but it had been all along, to preclude appeals in
cases of this sort.
So that as a matter of statutory law prior to 1971,

9

the federal government could not appeal rulings of this sort
in criminal cases.
Moreover, the issue did not come up in State cases,
because the double jeopardy clause, by the ruling in Palko,
was not deemed applicable to the States until the fairly
recent decision of this Court in Benton,
And I would like here to just point out, with
respect to the significance of Benton, something that Judge
Friendly noted, which is that the ruling that you make in
this case today is a ruling that will be binding not only oh
the federal government but on each of the fifty States.

And

if you say there can be no appeal here, you are saying that
this is a fundamental principle that is applicable in equal
force all over.

»

I should note that there are some States that have
authorized appeals in this situation as a matter of State
lav;.

There's a recent decision of the New York Court of

Appeals, in July of this year, in a case called
?
?
----------Insabella, 359 N.Y. Sub 2d 100.
QUESTION: Does every State have a double jeopardy
a guarantee against double jeopardy in its constitution,
do you know?
MR. FREY:

I'm not certain, but I think there is

generally some in — I'm told 48 of the 50 States do.
QUESTION: Constitutionali;'?

10
MR. FREY:

Have a State constitutional provision.

But of course the interpretation of that might be —
QUESTION:

Certainly.

MR. FREY;

— in accordance, for instance, with

Justice Holmes' dissent in Kapner.

one.

QUESTION;

Right.

MR. FREY;

Our position in this case is a very simple

We say that the concept of double jeopardy relates to

the subjection of a defendant in a criminal case to a second
trial.

It therefore comes into play only where a second

trial is to be had.
Since

our appeal, if successful, would ribt lead to

a second trial, double jeopardy is simply irrelevant here, and
the appeal is constitutionally permissible.
Now, in our brief we've set forth various authorities
that make it clear that the element of second trial was at the
heart of the double jeopardy notion at common law, and in the
application of the American constitutional principle, as
explicated by this Court on numerous occasions.
QUESTION:

Your appeal, if successful, if it had

been — your appeal, if successful and if it had been entertained by the Court of Appeals would have resulted in what?
MR, FREY:

It would have resulted in a remand

presumably with the — it would have resulted in a remand with
a direction to the District Court to undertake further pro-

11
ceedings under a correct view of the law, and those proceed~
ings would, in the absence of something that doesn’t appear
on the record, be the entry of a judgment of conviction.
It xfould not be the taking of further evidence,
It would not be the dismissal of this indictment and -the
commencement of a new proceeding with a new indictment.
It would simply be what we’re entitled f.o, we
believe, as a matter of law, is a judgment of conviction in
this case.
QUESTION;

Have you — I'm just thinking aloud;

if I've ever seen a reviewing court opinion, direction to
enter a judgment of conviction, simpliciter piano, without
any further proceedings.
QUESTION;

As I understood, it's a directed

verdict, isn't it?
MR. FREY;

Well, it's --

QUESTION;

Of guilty.

MR. FREY:

I'm not suggesting -—

QUESTION:

That would be —

MR. FREY:

~ that the Court of Appeals, as to

exactly what it is that the Court of Appeals would do. But
here we have a situation in which the District Judge has found,
as a fact, every element of the offense.

He's made his

findings of fact.
So it’s hard to conceive what he could do.

He would

12
have no choice as a matter of law, when the case goes back to
him, but to enter a judgment of conviction.
Now, perhaps what the Court of Appeals would do is
reverse the order dismissing the indictment, remand the case
for further proceedings consistent with its decision.
QUESTION:

What would "further proceedings" have

been, if not a trial?
MR. FREY:

Assume that if we win this case, and the

defendant does not avail himself of the clemency opportunity,
there will be the entry of a judgment of conviction.

I can't

imagine what else the District Court could do.
QUESTION: That's all?

Just without the defendant

even there in the courtroom?
MR. FREY:

Well, the trial was completed.

This

order was entered ~ of Judge Travia’s, was entered three weeks
after the trial was over.

And this order was legally incorrect,

it erroneously dismissed the indictment.
Now, he may have before him other motions, motions
for a new trial, motions for a verdict of acquittal on some
other ground.

I don’t, believe that that’s before him.

But if he had such motions before him, as in the
case of United States v. Weinstein, where a similar situation
arose, the Court, of Appeals sent it back and they said you
couldn't do what you did and now you can consider the motions
that are before you and proceed accordingly. Either grant a

13
new trial, which, was what was pending in Weinstein, or enter
a judgment of conviction in accordance with the jury'3 verdict»
I don't see that it's material for purposes of this
case what it is that would happen in the District Court, —QUESTION:

Well, you say —

MR. FREY:

— we're not asking for a further trial.

QUESTION:

Under your submission, it seems to me

it's quite material, because you say this would be a different
case if the remand —if you are successful in the Court of
Appeals, if the Court of Appeals entertained your appeal,
and if you succeeded on the merits of the appeal.

You

concede that there would be double jeopardy if the remand,
after your successful argument, after the Court of Appeals
accepted your argument, would be for a trial; don't you?
MR. FREY:
QUESTION:

Well, but whatever else —
So I think what happens after the

remand is rather important to your argument, as I understand
it.
MR. FREY: But, Mr. Justice Stewart, the question
is what is the relief that we are requesting.

In Fong Foo,

the relief that was requested was to vacate the judgment of
acquittal that had been entered by the District Court, and
to conduct, hold a new trial.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. FREY:

Now, the relief that we're requesting

14
here is not to hold a new trial» There's nothing in our
appeal that requires a new trial.
QUESTION: Well, what would you — what would the
prayer of your — what x?as the prayer of your brief in the
Court, of Appeals?
MR. PREY:
QUESTION:

Well, I'm sorry —
If the Court of Appeals directed a

judgment of guilty, that would be unprecedented, wouldn't it?
MR. FREY:

I don’t believe so.

I don't believe so.

But I think it's not --- it's not pertinent here, because we
are not — the trial was completed.
Let's suppose, for instance, that the District Court
had not made these findings of fact, the trial had simply -~
the trial had been completed and he had made his ruling of law
without making the findings of fact, all of them that are
essential for a conviction.

Then our

position is that the

case would be remanded to him to make findings of fact on the
basis of the evidence that he heard at trial, which he had
not yet made.
That process is not a second trial, whatever, it
may be a continuation of the first trial, but even that, it
seems to me, is questionable where the evidence has been
completed, the prosecution and the defense have rested and
submitted their case, made their final statements.
trial is over

The

15
Now the question is what legal consequences attach
to the events that occurred at trial.
QUESTION:

Well, it took the form of a dismissal of

the indictment, wasn't it?
MR. FREY: That's correct.
QUESTION: And I suppose the Court of Appeals could
reverse the order dismissing the indictment and remand the
case for further proceedings that might seem appropriate —
MR. FREY: That's what I'm suggesting that it should
do, yes.
Even if he had labeled it an acquittal, we would
say he should — which he didn't do here, but had he done it,
we would say that they would reverse the order of
acquittal and remand it for further proceedings consistent
with their decision.
QUESTION: Well, what if Judge Travia had determined,
on a somewhat different factual situation, after a bench
trial, that the statute of limitations barred tills prosecu­
tion, and made all the findings that indicated, otherwise
he would certainly find the man guilty.
But he says, on the basis of the statute of
limitations, I am going to enter a judgment of acquittal.
Do you say the government can. appeal that determination
without violating double jeopardy?
MR. FREY: Absolutely.

Absolutely.

16

Indeed, I think that the — that analytically it's
not the appeal itself that ever violates double jeopardy.
The problem is that the double jeopardy clause is pertinent
because if, what the relief that’s requested by the appeal is
a new trial, and if we may not, because of the double jeopardy
clausa, have a new trial, then we’re asking for an advisory
opinion. There is no case or controversy, and in that sense
the double jeopardy clause bars the appeal..
QUESTION:

So you distinguish between an identical

ruling on the statute of limitations at the close of all the
evidence, and one at the close of the government's case?
One, retrial would be required if you reversed the judgment
that was entered at the close of the government's case.
MR. FREY: We would distinguish it, and if it were
entered at the close of the government's case and prior to the
defense, in a jury trial — now, in a non-jury trial I think
it would be somewhat different, because you don’t need a
second trial.

We would argue that you would be sending it

back for a continuation of the first trial.
QUESTION:

You mean the judge would just pick up

hearing the evidence from the defendant two years later?
MR. FREY: Well, if it were two years later — I
don’t think that the Constitution would bar that in a judge
trial.
The essential notion that underlies the double

jeopardy protection is the notion that there has been a
factual finding by the trier of fact that acts necessary to
constitute the offense did not occur as charged.
And it's that finding, as United States v. Ball
makes clear,

and that’s the paraplegmatic double jeopardy

protection, it’s that finding which cannot be challenged.
Now, if the judge says, at the close of the
government’s evidence, that it shows that the defendant was
wearing a green hat, and that’s an affirmative defense, and
therefore he enters a judgment of acquittal.
Our view is that that should be an appealable
order, even if he doesn't wait until the end of the trial.
But, of course, we don't have to struggle with that here,
because he did wait until the end of the trial.
QUESTION:

Mr. Frey, I still think you're asking

the Court of Appeals to direct a verdict of guilty.
MR. FREY:
QUESTION?

No, I'm saying —
I don’t see how you can get away from

it.
MR. FREY:

I'm suggesting that as a legal matter

the only possibly correct action that could have been taken
in this case, on the basis of the evidence found by the judge
was a verdict of guilty.

I'm not saying that the Court of

Appeals should direct it.
In the Zissblatt case,

which we quote in our* brief

18
Judge Hand addressed himself to the difference between errors
of judges and errors of juries, and he said that the
defendant — the double jeopardy protection does not extend to
legal errors by judges.

And I think Zissblatt was one of thes

motion-in-bar post- —

QUESTION:

You’re saying that the Court of Appeals

That’s one of your problems, isn’t it?

MR. FREY: Well, the verdict can be — can be

I don't see that judgment can be

entered on the remand,
QUESTION: Well, supposing the Court of Appeals had
decided it had jurisdiction in this case, said Judge Travia
was wrong on the legal point, reversed the order dismissing
the indictment, and remanded for further proceedings.
Judge Travia then again addresses himself to the
question of what judgment should be entered, since the
previous judgment has been vacated.

He says, on second

thought I’ve got reasonable doubt about this, I’m going to
enter a judgment of acquittal.
Would he be free to do that, do you think?
MR. FREY: Well, there are two points that are

20
relevant here.

One is that the defendant hag waived a jury

trial/ and when he waived the jury trial he waived, in our
view, the right to a completely irrational determination,
And there’s a case, which Judge Friendly wrote for the Second
Circuit, called United States v. Mayberry in 274 F. 2d, in
which he said;

We do not believe we would enhance respect

for law or for the courts by recognising for a judge the
same right to indulge in vagarities in the disposition of
criminal charges that, for historic reasons, has been granted
to the jury.
Now, we’re saying that when the defendant waived a
jury trial, he waives, in a sense, his right to a completely
irrational
QUESTION;

Are you saying that Judge Friendly's

view, as there expressed, is that -the judge, at a bench trial,
can’t for any ox* no reason direct an acquittal, as the jury
could?
MR. FREY; Well, we are straying somewhat from the
issue —■
QUESTION;

No, but is that what you’re saying?

MR. FREY:

— in this case.

I’m suggesting that

there would be a substantial question as to whether the judge
has the power

and we certainly think he hasn’t the right?

but whether he has the power —
QUESTION;

You mean if Judge Travia did what my

21
brother Rehnquist suggests, that the government could appeal
that?
MR. PREY: Well, tlie government could not review.
There is a problem of reviewability, of course, if he malf.es a
finding that the defendant did report for induction, or that
he has a reasonable doubt that he failed to report for
induction —QUESTION:

No, but this is on -the review.

That

you suggested would happen in this case if you prevail.
If it goes back to Judge Travia — I guess he’s no longer on
the bench, is he?
MR. FREY:
QUESTION:

That’s right.
Yes.

But if it went back to Judge

Travia and he were now to say, as ray brother Rehnquist said,
Well, on second thought, I entertain it -—
•

MR. PREY:

If he were to say, on second thought I

have a reasonable doubt as to one of the elements of the
offense, and I find as a fact that there is a reasonable
doubt about a certain necessary element of the offense, I
have a reasonable doubt that he ever rec eived his notice to
report, and therefore it’s not "knowing".
There are clear limits on the way — on our ability
to challenge this.
QUESTION:

That's basically an unreviewable finding Well, suppose he didn't say "I entertain

a reasonable doubt", he said nothing except, "I direct a

22
verdict" — or "I find the defendant not guilty.”
MR. PREY:

Not guilty.

Well, all right —

QUESTION: And that's all he says.
MR. FREY: Well, our contention in our brief, of
course, we've taken the view that an unexplicated acquittal
is not what’s at issue here.
But in terms of considering the possible approaches
to this problem, were we to have a case with an unexplicated
acquittal, but with findings of fact which we're entitled to
request from the judge under Rule 23(c), in which he says:
I find beyond a reasonable doubt that the three elements of the
offense, A, B and C, each occurred; and then he said, I
acquit.
I think we would take the position, in such case —
and that's not this case — that.we could have appellate
review.
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

It could be this case.
You’d be right up against Fong Foo, if

you did so, wouldn't you?
MR. FREY:

Not at all, because we're not asking

that we start the proceeding over again with the taking of
new evidence before the judge, which is what jeopardy
consists of.

We're not asking for -—

QUESTION:

Also the holding was a greviously

erroneous judgment of acquittal midway in the trial, and the

23
~ your client, the United States, as I remember, sought
mandamus in that, gat it from the First Circuit Court of
AppealsPthis Court reversed, and saids

no matter how

erroneous, no matter hoi? egregiously erroneous, that action
of the District Judge entering a judgment of acquittal was
— was an acquittal, and any further proceedings would be
double jeopardy.
MR. FREYs

Well, let me make two points about that.

First of all, it did not say any further proceedings,
it said that you can’t have an appeal because what the
government is asking for you can't have mandamus, you can't
have appellate review.

So what the government is asking for

is to start the whole proceeding over again, empanel a new
jury’', begin all over again.
That is not our case, it is not remotely like our
case.

There simply is no question of having a second trial

in this case, in the sense which is relevant to double
jeopardy under the decisions of this Court.
And the second point, about Fong Foo, is that the
issue of whether an acquittal could be appealed was never
argued in Fong Foo.

The government simply rested its

contention in that case on the contention that what happened
there was not an acquittal, and not at all on the question
of whether — which is here today, about the appealability
of acquittals.

That was assumed as given by all parties,

24
and there only in the context where reversal would lead to a
second trial.
Now, before getting to the cases in detail, I5d
like to consider the ramifications of policy for this issue.
The affect of the ruling below, as well as that of
the Court of Appeals in Wilson, is to let a clearly guilty
defendant, that is, one who has been found by the trier of
fact, beyond a reasonable doubt, to have committed all the
acts constituting the offense, to let such a defendant go free
because of a trial judge's erroneous interpretation of a
point of law.
Now, we submit that one is hard-pressed to imagine
how such a result furthers the ends of public justice.
As Mr. Justice Harlan said in dealing with a
related question in United States v. Tafcao, which is in 377
U.S. at page 466s

Corresponding to the right of an accused to

be given a fair trial is the societal interest in punishing
one whose guilt is clear after he has obtained such a trial;
to wit, Mr. Jenkins.
It would be a high price, indeed, for society to pay
were every accused granted immunity from punishment because
of any defect sufficient to constitute reversible error in
the proceedings leading to conviction.
Now, there he was talking about a retrial after
a conviction, but I think the thoughts, as a policy matter,

25
in terms of what we‘re talking about here* what kind of
protection we8 re affording to defendants if we adopt the rule
of the Second Circuit in this case.
I think the thoughts are pertinent.
He also made another point in this connection in
that paragraph in Tateo, in which he said that if the rule
were otherwise, appellate courts would be loath to apply
the laws they saw fit and reverse convictions on close
questions, because the consequence would be to immunize the
defendant from a retrial.
Well, the same thing is true here, if you say that
an error of law by the District Court committed on a motion
such as this foraven immunizes the defendant from further
proceedings, no matter how erroneous the ruling is, then
District Judges are going to be reluctant to make these
rulings the way they see fit.

They‘11 leave it to the Court

of Appeals, in order to avoid this manifestly unjust
situation.
So it's not an unmitigated blessing to the
defendant if you were to adopt the position of the Second
Circuit.
I'd like to reserve the balance of my time for
rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs
Mr. Carroll.

Very well, Mr. Frey.

26
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES S. CARROLL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. CARROLL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue that the Court will have to determine,
after the submission of the briefs and the oral argument in
this case, is whether the United States had the right to
appeal from the District Court’s order acquitting the ,
defendant in this case after trial, and after the defendant
had. been put into jeopardy.
Whether the Court of Appeals in this case was
correct in its determination that it did not have jurisdiction
under either Section 3731 of Title IS of under the double
jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to hear and determine
this appeal.
The government contends that the District Court’s
decision was appealable, because it was a purely legal ruling
with undisputed findings of fact, and that this purely legal
ruling could be corrected by the mere expedient of sending
the case back to the District Court with instructions to
enter a judgment of conviction.
Aside from the fact that I feel that such a course
goes directly counter to the spirit that the double jeopardy
clause is supposed to protect, I don't think that this particu­
lar position by the government has any sanction or any support

27

in the cases of this Court.
It is our contention that the decision of the
District Court Judge »was one that was based on facts
adduced atthe trial, which went to the general issue of the
case, and, as such, this was an acquittal from which no appeal
was to be allowed.
In addition, we question whether the decision of
the District Court was a purely legal ruling.

And whether

this so-called legal ruling could be corrected by the simple
expedient of directing a judgment of conviction.
We further question whether the government has
complied with Section 3731 of the Criminal Appeals Act in
that this appeal was not expeditiously prosecuted as is
mandated by Section 3731.
To delve into the facts of this case:

On February

4, 1971, Mr. Jenkins received a notice to report for
induction.

Directly thereafter — and this notice to report

for induction, excuse me, was for February 24 of 1971.
Directly thereafter, Mr, Jenkins went to a draft
counselor, by the name of Jerome Bibuld. In turn, Mr. Bifauld
contacted myself.
Subsequently Mr. Jenkins mailed a letter to the
Local Board requesting a CO 150 form, and to this he received
no response from the Local Board.
On February 23rd of 1971, the day before Mr. Jenkins

28
was to report for induction, Mr. Jenkins v;ent to the Local
Board, he had conversation with Miss Elaine Morris, the
secretary of the Local Board, and he asked that he be given a
CO 150 form, and that his induction date be postponed.
At that time Miss Morris called New York City
headquarters and spoke to Mr, Thomas Maher, who was the Chief
of the Legal Division of Selective Service Headquarters in
New York City.

Mr. Maher directed that Mr, Jenkins write out

a brief statement of his beliefs and opposition to war.
After doing so, and after reading this brief
statement to Mr. Maher over the telephone, Mr. Maher determined
that Mr. Jenkins had not made out a prima facie case for
opposition to all war.

Because Mr. Jenkins, in his statement,

had said that he was opposed to the war, this present war?
although he did not exclude opposition to all wars in his
statement.
QUESTION:

And Mr. Maher was what —■ the Clerk of

the Selective Service Board?
MR. CARROLL:

Mr. Maher was 'the Director of the

Legal Division of Selective Service Headquarters in New York
City.

Mr. Malier is presently a U. S. Attorney in the Eastern

District of New York.

At the time of the prosecution of this

case, Mr. Maher was the U. S. Attorney assigned to prosecute
this case.
In fact, a motion was made directly prior to the

29

trial to have Mr. Maher excluded from prosecuting the case,
and subsequently, during the course of the trial, Mr. Maher
appeared as a witness for the government, to detail the facts
that I have just gone into before the court.
On February 24th, Mr. Jenkins did not report for
induction.

We have not disputed this.
But later on, in March of 1971, Mr. Jenkins did

return the CO Form to the Local Board.

No action was taken

on that form.
It was in April of 1971 that Ehlert vs. United
States was decided.

Ehlert intervened between the date

that Mr. Jenkins was to report for induction and returned the
CO 150 form and the date that Mr. Jenkins was subsequently
indicted for failure to report for induction.
On October 3rd of 1972, the case came to trial.
We waived trial by jury.

The original prosecutor, Mr. Mahsr,

was substituted, and the government presented two witnesses:
the executive secretary of the Local Board and Thomas Maher.
It is true that before trial we had asked for 45
days in which to present all motions.

No pretrial motions

were presented, because the Selective Service file was
turned over to us, which gave us all of the discovery that
we required in the particular case.
The defense presented three witnesses, Mr. Jenkins,
the defendant, Mr. Jenkins* mother, and Mr. Jerome Bibuld,

30
who was Mr. Jenkins5 draft counselor.
However, Mr. Bibuld’s testimony wets not allowed in
the case, although we had made an offer of proof that Mr.
Bibuld would show that Mr, Jenkins was aware of the fact
that he could present a CO 150 form at this time, according
to the applicable case law at hat time, and that Mr. Jenkins5
beliefs in opposition to the war had crystallized after the
date that he was ordered to report for induction but before
the date of actual induction.
This was pursuant to the applicable case law in the
Second Circuit at that time.
As I stated, the court excluded Mr. Bibuld*s
testimony, although an offer of proof was made.
We also had three other witnesses who were character
witnesses, however, we stipulated to their testimony.
After the trial of the case, Judge Travia requested
whether we would like to argue at the particular time as to
Mr. Jenkins5 guilt or innocence of the offense, or whether we
would prefer to submit findings of 'fact and conclusions of
law.
We opted for the latter, and we submitted findings
of fact and conclusions of law, proposed findings of fact and
conclusions of lav/, to Judge Travia.

Several weeks thereafter,

•the judgment was rendered.
The government states that -this was a dismissal of

31
an indictment.

In fact, in Judge Travia's opinion, after

findings of fact and after his discussion of the applicable
law, Judge Travia did in fact state that the indictment in
tills case is dismissed, and the defendant is discharged.
QUESTION: Did you submit proposed findings and
conclusions?
MR. CARROLL:
QUESTION:

Yes, I did.
And is that, at page 52a, Judge

Travia's first sentence:

"The indictment in this case is

dismissed and the defendant is discharged".

Is that your

submission?
MR. CARROLL:

I requested that judgment of

acquittal be rendered.

I never — I never requested that the

indictment be dismissed.
In fact, to go into that briefly, the record —
QUESTION:

You say judgment of acquittal —

excuse me —
MR. CARROLL:
QUESTION:

Yes.

— judgment of acquittal in haec verba,

or just not guilty; what was it you asked?
MR. CARROLL:

No, I asked for a judgment of

acquittal from the judge.
QUESTION:

Judgment of acquittal,

I see.

QUESTION: That's gie motion that appears on page -—
that starts on page 4 of tho Appendix, I think, isn't it?

32

MR. CARROLL:
QUESTION;

Yes.

But ~

Motion for Judgment of Acquittal,

signed by you.
MR. CARROLL:

That’s correct.

Throughout the course of these proceedings, however,
I was maintaining not simply that on the law Ehlert vs. United
States was not retroactive.

In fact, I never made such a

broadside attack against Ehlert vs. United States.
In fact, what I was saying was that with the
peculiar circumstances of Mr. Jenkins' case, Mr. Jenkins was
represented by counsel and he had consulted a draft
counselor prior to this, he was aware of the applicable case
law..

The Local Board received his CO 150 form and didn't

act on it, even though Geary at that time required that they
do so.
And Ehlert came out one month after all of these
transactions. And my position was, and I think the position
that Judge Travia adopted was that under the peculiar circum­
stances of Jenkins' case, that Ehlert vs. United States should
not be applied to him.

That, in fact, Ehlert vs. United States

would have been unduly harse in the circumstances of Mr.
Jenkins' case.
I’d like to point out also that Mr. Jenkins did take
the stand, that during the course of these proceedings,
while Mr. Jenkins was testifying. Judge Travia interrupted my

33

direct examination several times.

In fact, at one point

during the direct examination, Judge Travia took over the
direct examination and questioned Mr. Jenkins very closely
about his sincerity, and went in very deeply into Mr.
Jenkins' credibility in stating that he was in fact a
conscientious objector.
Now, I have also raised another issue, which I
didn’t ex plore in much depth in my brief, but I would like
to bring to the Court's attention:

that the trial in this

case commenced on October 3rd of 1972, the judgment of the
District Court was .rendered on October 24th of 1972.
The government's notice of appeal was filed on
November 21st, 1972.

Its brief, however, was not filed

until June 13th of 1973.
In its decision dated December 11th of .1973,
the Court of Appeals admonished the government and stated
that the government had not, in their view, complied with
Section 3731's mandate that the appeals be diligently
prosecuted by the government.
They stated in a footnote that the delay in appealing
the case, by the government, and I quote,.they stated, "thie
scarcely conforms with our notion of diligent prosecution,
and we would have dismissed the appeal on that ground if
defendant had so requested."
After this decision came down, the government

34

requested one extension of time to petition for rehearing
before the Court of Appeals.
February 6 of 1974.

The rehearing was denied on

Later the government asked for an

extension of time to petition for a x*/rit of certiorari to
this Court, and by order of Mr. Justice Marshall, on
February 28 of 1974, the time for filing a writ of certiorari
was extended to April 7th of 1974; the petition being filed
on April 8th.
It was on May 28th of 1974 that the petition was
granted.

Again, on July 10th of 1974, the government

requested an extension of time to file the brief, to July
24th, 1974; which was granted.
The brief of the government was not received by
my office until September 17th of 1974.

Similarly — and I

don't think I'm coming into this Court with unclean hands,
although I’m asking equitable relief, on October 10th of
this year I requested an extension of one month’s time, to
November 14th, 1974.

The argument was set up today, of

course.
I think that under the statute itself, that the
government has not complied with the mandate in Section 3731
to prosecute appeals diligently.
QUESTION;

Mr. Carroll, in the Second Circuit's

opinion, that footnote you quoted, page 3a of the Petition for
Writ of Certiorari, where the Court of Appeals is talking about

35

dismissal of the appeal for failure to diligently prosecute,
which it said it didn't reach, it said "if defendant had so
requested".

Had you requested dismissal?

MR, CARROLLs

No, I had not, sir, requested it.

I don't tliink, however, that I waive the right to
bring this to this Court's attention, however, because I
think it's an affirmative obligation on the government's
part to comply with all sections of that particular statute.
QUESTION:

In bringing it to our attention, what

are you suggesting now, Mr. Carroll?
MR. CARROLLs
QUESTION:

You went through the entire —

MR. CARROLLs
QUESTION;

I'ra suggesting that

Yes.

— routine here, right up through the

filing of briefs here.
MR. CARROLL:

Yes.

I am suggesting, Mr. Justice Blackmun, that the
government — or, rather, this appeal should be dismissed
on two grounds:

first, that the government has not complied

with Section 3731, in that this particular appeal is barred
by the double jeopardy clause; and on the second ground, that
QUESTION:

You really mean certiorari, don't you?

MR. CARROLL: Excuse me?
QUESTION;

You said "appeal", you mean certiorari.

MR. CARROLL:

Well, I’m talking about the original

36

appeal to the Court of Appeals,- which, I think, is what is in
issue now:

whether the Court of Appeals originally had

jurisdiction to hear the appeal.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR, CARROLL:

But I’m also stating that because of

the fact that the government has not complied with all of
the provisions of Section 3731, in that they have not
diligently prosecuted the appeal, that on that separate
ground the original appeal should not have been allowed.
The government had made several statements in which
they tried to take this particular case out of the traditional
case of an acquittal being rendered after a trial before a
judge or a jury.
They first make the distinction between a purely
legal ruling and the ruling on the facts.
I think this particular distinction is untenable.
I think that in this particular case individual facts were
considered by the District Court in mailing its final ruling
that the indictment should be dismissed.
In fact, the court went very deeply into the facts
of this particular case, and again, as 1 have stated, the
court found that under the peculiar circumstances of this case,
that Jenkins was not guilty.
It stated that under the facts of the case, where
Jenkins was apprised of the law of the Second Circuit, which

37
differed from other Circuits at that time, that Jenkins should
not be found guilty of refusing to submit to induction.
This case should not be any different because a
judge made articulated findings of fact and conclusions of
law.

A judge, as was stated in United States vs. Mayberry,

does not have the luxury to issue simply a judgment of not
guilty or guilty.

In fact, he must make findings of fact

and conclusions of law.
Eut I submit to you that in this particular case
Judge Travia was acting as a fact-finder, that the findings
of fact cannot be limited only to the findings of fact that
he articulated.
I think he found nine — nine facts in the case.
But I believe that through his discussion he indicated that
he had gone deeply into this defendant's credibility, and
he indicated that this was part of his decision, that Jenkins
would be unduly prejudiced by a different finding by the
court.
I could analogize this situation to one that was
stated in the Sisson case, where the judge had stated to the
jury:

If you find such facts, then you will render a verdict

of not guilty.
And I think it was the same tiling.

Judge Travia

found such facts, articulated in his findings of fact and
articulated in his discussion of the law, and on the basis

38

of that, he found that Jenkins was not guilty.
If, for example, a judge had given erroneous
instructions to a jury, or if, for example, a jury had applied
a judge's correct instructions on the law erroneously, in the
same way such a verdict from the jury would not be subject to
any review, as it was stated in United States vs. Ball.
QUESTION:

Mr. Carroll, if the government should

prevail here and the case went back, do you think Judge
Travia, assuming he were to hear it, could sit on the findings
of fact that were made, or would he have to make new ones or
additional ones?

What is your evaluation of that?

MR. CARROLL:

I think that if the Court finds that

there is jurisdiction in this case, that the case would have
to be sent back to Judge Travia for retrial.

And the reason

for that is that the Court of Appeals recognized that an
affirmative defense could be asserted that Jenkins had in
good faith relied upon the existing case law in the Circuit
at that time, ir. refusing induction.
Now, although I think that Judge Travia did make
such a finding, although not expressly articulated or
impliedly articulated, I think that at the time of trial
Judge Travia believed that it was improper to go into that
question at the trial stage, when — when I asked that Mr.
Bibuld, the counselor, take the stand, the government asked
for an offer of proof, and when my offer of proof was that Mr.

39
Bibuld would testify as to Mr. Jenkins' conversations with
him, and that Mr. Jenkins' beliefs in opposition to war
crystallised after February 4th of 1971 but before February
24th cf 1971, Judge Travia excluded that testimony because
he believed that it would not be relevant, and he believed
in fact that it would be redundant of what was already in the
Selective Service file.
QUESTION: Well, I take it, you're saying, then,
that if the government should prevail and the case is
remanded, there's no way to avoid a new trial?
MR. CARROLL:

I'm saying that.

I'm also stating, that the distinction that the
government makes between pure — a pure legal ruling and
findings of fact is not articulated anywhere in the case
law, and, in fact, is directly contradicted by the case law.
Sisson makes it very clear that the rule or the test that
is to be used is whether, on the basis of facts adduced at
the trial, going to the general issue of the case, whether
the defendant is guilty or not guilty.
NOW —

QUESTION:

To pursue Mr. Justice Blackmun's

question, to which you answered that there would be no
way of avoiding a new trial, would that new trial be limited
to the election to hav e a bench trial, or would the parties
all be free to start from scratch, as it were?

40

And decided to have a jury trial, if they wanted,
MR. CARROLL:

X imagine that the parties would

start from scratch, but the first motion that would be made
in such a case would be a motion in bar to stop such a trial
on the grounds of double jeopardy.
Rut I don't think that it's necessary to go that
far, because I think the appeal in this case alone puts the
defendant in double jeopardy.

I feel that there was an

acquittal in this case, that any subsequent proceedings in
this case put the defendant into double jeopardy.
I don’t think it6s necessary for the government to
go to the expense of having this case sent back for another
trial# when the only thing that would result from such a
course would be for that trial to# itself# be barred by the
double jeopardy clause.
QUESTION: Well# of course# if# in fact, it goes back,
the reason it will go b^ck is because this Court has said
there was no double jeopardy.:
MR. CARROLL:

That’s correct, if it does in fact

go back, that would be the determination.
But I think that in a sense the government has
thrown in a confusing factor by asking whether# in fact, the
— whether, in fact# it would require a new trial or whether
a judgment of conviction could simply be entered.
I think that's putting the cart before the horse.

41
The initial question is whether this Court has
jurisdiction to hear the appeal, and whether the Court of
Appeals initially had jurisdiction to hear the appeal.
What would happen subsequently is not directly in
point.

If this Court does reach the merits of this case,

however, I submit to you that the ruling of the District
Judge was correct under the circumstances, and that, although
he was not stating that Ehlert didn't apply to all cases, he
was correct in stating that Ehlert did not apply to the
particular situation involved in United States vs. Jenkins.
I think the government's appeal is barred by the
applicable case law, starting with United States vs. Ball,
continuing to Kepner vs. United States, and ending up with
Fong Foo and Sisson.

The Court has stated repeatedly that

an appeal alone is barred by the double jeopardy clause,
and if this is true, whether the trial is before a judge or
before a jury, and that the test to be used is not whether it
was a pure legal ruling or a factual ruling, but whether, on
the basis of facts adduced at trial, the judge went to the
general issue or guilty or not guilty.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Carroll.

Mr. Frey, you have a few minutes left.

42

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FREY:

On the question of whether there has

to be a retrial, which seems to be focal here, there is
absolutely nothing in our appeal which asks, on behalf of the
government, that there be a new trial in this case as a
result of the correction of error.
QUESTION:
MR. FREY:

Maybe the other side would want one.
Maybe they would, and maybe they would be

entitled to one? and if they request one and are entitled to
one, the double jeopardy clause does not preclude that relief.
But we're not at that stage.
And I think it’s .important to understand the
Mercado case, and to understand that we do not have here an
issue of fact in any significant sense.
There is not a shred of evidence in the record in
this case, nor is there any tiling in Judge Travia's decision,
that bases itself on actual reliance by this registrant on
the law of the Second Circuit, as opposed to constructive
reliance on the law.
There's no reference, in fact, to reliance on the
law, but to the unfairness of applying it retroactively.
And, as a matter of law, we think Mercado makes it
clear that even if he did ir> fact rely on the prior law of the
Second Circuit, he would have no defense.

43
What the Court said in -Mercado was:

Upholding the

conviction of a registrant who claims to have relied on
pre-existing case law would appear to be no more chan an
application of the settled rule that an erroneous belief that
an induction order is invalid, even if based on the advice
of counsel, is not a defense to a prosecution for refusing
induction; and that one who refuses induction on the basis
of such belief acts at his peril.
That's the law in the Second Circuit.
They talked about a possible exception, but it's
that exception would be orior to the time of this Court's
grant of certiorari in Ehlert, because they said that the
grant of certiorari in Ehlert cast Geary into sufficient
question that nobody could properly rely on the Second
Circuit law.
Jenkins and Mercado were factually situated and in
the identical circumstance.
Let me say further, there has been a reference to an
offer of proof with respect to the draft counselor, Mr. Bibuld,
now, if you will look at page 70 of the Appendix, you'll see
exactly what that offer of proof was.
Mr. Carroll said that what Mr. Bibuld would testify
to was that after discussing Mr. Jenkins' case with him for
some time, Mr. Bibuld elicited from the registrant the fact
that he was conscientiously opposed to all wars.

And it was

44
only at this time that Mr. Jenkins became aware of his
conscientious opposition to all wars.
Then there was further inquiry into this matter of
the offer of proof, and on page 71 Mr. Carroll said, "I think
the sincerity of the registrant is in issue."
And later on, on page 73, the Court said, "How is
he going to change the facts ... with his testimony?"
Mr. Carroll said, "He's going to amplify on the
sincerity of the registrant's beliefs, which I state was
tested by the local board prior to any type of permissive
hearing by the local board."
And the testimony of Mr. Jenkins want to the
question of sincerity, and that was irrelevant to this issue.
I see my time has- expired.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 12:00 noon, the case in the aboveentitled matter was submitted.]
