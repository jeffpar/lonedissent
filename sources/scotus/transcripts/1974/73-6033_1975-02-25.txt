PROCE E D I N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

next in Mo. 73-6033» Roe against Horton.
Mr. Cochran» you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK COCHRAN GM BEHALF
OF PARENT APPELLANTS
MR. COCHRAN: Mr, Chief Justice» and may it please
the Court:

The issue in this case is the validity of a

Connecticut statute under which mothers of illegitimate children
may he forced to nan® the father,to initiate and prosecute
paternity action to judgment»

a

whether or not they believe

it'ss in the child's best interests,under pain of up to, a year
in jail or fine of up to $200.
QUESTION:

In Connecticut may the State bring the

action on its own, Mr. Cochran, independent of the wishes pr
the actions of the mother?
MR. COCHRAN:

The State has the power under a

separate section of the general statute to initiate a paternity
action in its own behalf for any child which is supported by
State welfare, yes.

That statute is not in issue here.

The

issue here is the requirement that the mother disclose, the
name of the father in the first instance and subsequently to
initiate and prosecute,
QUESTION;

Are you saying that the existence of that

other statute has no bearing on the problems, the issues» of

this case?
MB,» COCHRAN?

1 think it has some bearing.

X merely

meant to point out that decision adverse to the statute in
this case does not strike down that interest of the State.
The interest the mothers are attempting to protect is their
own right of privacy and not the State’s interest once it has
the name.
This statute is applicable irregardless of the
actual interests of mothers or the actual interests of the
children, and in the record there are affidavits from, X
believe, two mothers,
fathers before.

who in fact had been beaten by the

There was one case in which there was a

possible incestuous parentage, and also in which the actual
paternity couldn't be determined with certainty.

There are

real reasons why -the interests of mothers and/or children are
opposed to bringing actions in many cases
We submit that the questions involved in this case —
QUESTION:

Mr. Cochran, were all of the mothers

involved here AFDC recipients?
MR, COCHRAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, they were.

Is this a class action on behalf of AFDC

recipients?
MR, COCHRAN:
QUESTION;

Yes, it is.

Certified as such?

MR, COCHRAN;

It was certified by the district court.

5

QUESTION:

1 take it, then, that may make the new

Federal statute particularly pertinent?
MR. COCHRAN i

Yes, the new Federal statute does have

pertinency here, and I was going to get to that in just a
second.
QUESTIONS

In your own due time»

MR, COCHRAN;

Because one of the specific classes

of women to whom this statute is applicable is AFDC mothers ,
the Social Security Act is relevant to tills case»

Now,

Congress —
QUESTION;
standing,

Welly do you suggest -these mothers have

and say all AFDC recipients and only such, to bring

this attack on the statute on behalf of non-AFDC recipients?
MR. COCHRAN;

The district court did not find that

the appellants represented any other subclass subject to this
,. statute, and we have not challenged that»
QUESTION;

So then as it comes to us, it is confined

to the framework of AFDC recipients?
MR. COCHRAN;
QUESTION;

That's correct, your Honor.

But idle statute does apply to non-AFDC

recipients?
MR. COCHRAN:

The statute on its face imposes an

obligation on all mothers of illegitimate children.

However,

there is enforcement of this statute, and a specific mechanism
for enforcement set up for only three subclasses, which include

6
mothers who are on AFDC» mothers receiving town assistance*
and mothers who for one reason or another are not the, guardians
of their children or for whom guardians ad litem had been
appointed.
The Congress in public law 93-647 which was passed
in the last day of the past session of Congress did enact
extensive amendments to the Social Security Act* including
a major part concerning child support.

The basic thrust of

that part was to strengthen the enforcement of child support
obligations around the country.

As part of the child

support program 'which will be mandatory on the States as
part of their AF.DC programs* Congress required that States
give an incentive payment to cooperating parents of 40 percent
of the first $50 recovered from an absent parent in support.
It also provided a sanction* termination of the mothers'
welfare benefits.

It made very clear that it was not sanction­

ing termination of the child's welfare benefits by providing
that those continue in the form of protective payments which
had to go to the child.
In the course of its deliberations Congress rejected
a bill, S. 1842, which would have made it a Federal misdemeanor
to refuse to cooperate with the welfare department.

That is

the equivalent to what Connecticut does here.

As I say* this

was rejected by the Senate Finance Committee.

And I think

that the legislative history clearly shows that Congress in

7
passing the provisions which it did pass set the limits of the
powers of the State to infringe on the fundamental purposes of
AFDC in pursuing its own financial interests, those purposes
being to safeguard the best interests of children by providing
support for them in their own homes and to maintain and
strengthen family life»
In passing the provisions which it passed, Congress
clearly indicated that no other, and certainly no more severe,
sanctions could ba employed in tills regard,
Furthermore, the Connecticut statute does, it seems
to us, clearly undermine the general requirement of regulations
of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare that
methods of administration used in the AFDC program not under­
mine the privacy and dignity of recipients„
QUESTION:

Mr, Cochran, I take it none of these

named appellants has been receiving AFDC benefits by force of
this Connecticut statute?
MR. COCHRAN:

No, that’s not correct.

They have been

receiving benefits.
QUESTION:
MR. COCHRAN:

By force of stays, or what?
No, this statute does not terminate

them from receiving benefits.

It provides only sanctions of

imprisonment or fine, as a contempt.
any sanction of termination.

It does not provide for

That is indeed one of the, if

not the major points we are trying to make.

s
QUESTIONS

Well, have they in fact been subject to

contempt proceedings?
MR. COCHRAN;

The two named appellants here have

been subjsct to contempt proceedings which are pending in
State court and have been stayed for a considerable period of
time.
QUESTION;

But they have not actually resulted in

contempt judgments?
MR. COCHRANs
QUESTION;

No, they have not.
Were those contempt proceedings initiated

before or after you brought this action in the district court?
MR. COCHRAN;

They were initiated before.

At that

point we filed motions in those proceedings to raise the
very constitutional issues which we have raised here/ and the
•court determined to stay its hand — simultaneously filed the
Federal action, I believe, the court determined to stay its
hand pending determination by the district .-court of the
complaint in this case.
QUESTION;
before the horse?

Isn't that kind of getting the cart
The first court to acquire jurisdiction, I

gather, was the State courts in the contempt proceedings,
right?
MRo COCHRAN;
QUESTION;

That’s correct.

And you interposed your constitutional and

statutory defenses, right?

9

MR. COCHRANs
QUESTION:

That's correct.

Why shouldn't that litigation have gone

to its conclusion -MR, COCHRAN;
QUESTION:

Well, the State court indicated —

-- and the Federal court stayed its hand.

MR, COCHRAN:

The State court indicated its unwilling­

ness to decide constitutional issues „

It. is about the lowest

State court, at that time the circuit court,

that's subsequently

been transferred to the court of common pleas.

But there is a

doctrine in Connecticut of avoiding constitutional adjudications.
QUESTION:

Was this the court's own decision or was

this something that you asked the State court to do?
MR. COCHRAN:

I honestly don't remember that,

I

believe --- we certainly didn't oppose it.
QUESTION:

There is another doctrine about this

Court and the Federal courts abstaining until States perform
their function.
MR. COCHRAN:
that.

I would say a couple of things about

There certainly is such a doctrine.

It is not, I would

say, a favored doctrine in Civil Rights Act litigation such as
thi b .
QUESTION:

It was born in one.

MR. COCHRAN:

That's true.

I'm not disputing that,

but —
QUESTION:

Well, this is criminal contempt, isn't, it?

MR. COCHRAN:

It's not clear what sort of contempt

this is„
QUESTI Oil;

Was it a criminal case?

QUESTION:

bid they go to jail?

MR. COCHRAN;

It was not a criminal case.

You can

go to jail.
QUESTION:

For a fixed time?

MR. COCHRAN:

For a fixed national time.

On the

other hand, the State was of the opinion that it %v*as a civil
contempt in the sense that it could be purged.
QUESTION; I thought you said it 'was sort of like the
misdemeanor that the Congress turned down.
MR. COCHRAN; I think that the sanctions of a year in
jail or fine are similar in that respect.

...

QUESTION;

Very close..

QUESTION:

Would it not he a proceedings for official

to bring it within the Younger rationale?
I1R. COCHRAN:

It might very well be, but I don't

believe Younger applies here for a couple of other reasons,
notably the State courts stayed its own action and the State's
failure to raise any such issue here.

I believe in the

Broadrick case ws have the same situation where the State did
not raise any sort of abstention point.
QUESTION:

The doctrine being comity of the State,

the States may waive it if they want to.

11
MR. COCI IRAM:
QUESTION;

That’s correct,, but •—

You say that's what the State did here.

MR. COCHRAN:

Well, the State certainly never raised

it, hasn't to this point raised it at any time.
QUESTION:

Did the district court address itself to

the problem formally or informally?
MR. COCHRAN:

It certainly didn’t formally.

it didn't informally either.
QUESTION:

I believ

I have no recollection of —-

Are your two clients in jeopardy?

MR. COCHRAN;

They are in jeopardy in the sense that

the petitions against them are pending at this time and will
go forward at some point unless there is a definitive determina
tion,
QUESTION:

As I understand it, it is now stayed, that

it will not go forward unless something else happens.
MR. COCIIRAN:

At this point, Mr. Mustice Marshall,

they are stayed until Friday of this week,

Whether they will

be stayed beyond that, I cannot —
QUESTION:

That’s an order that the State cannot

proceed until Friday of this week.
MR. COCHRAN:

The State court issued an order, I

believe it was in December, to that effect, staying those
actions until the 23th of February, which is Friday of this
week.
QUESTION:

And that's all it said?

12

MR. COCHRAN;

Yes.

That wasn't all it said, no.

said pending hearing in this Court.

It

Obviously it was aware,

however, there would not be a decision in this Court in that
time.
QUESTION:

And pending in both courts are the exact

same constitutional points.
MR. COCHRAN:

I would say they are not really pending

in the State court in the sense that the State has declined
to adjudicate those issues.

Furthermore, I would point out

that what we are looking for here, I think, is a declaratory
judgment,principally I think it would be followed in the
State, and I believe that this case is therefore very similar
■?

to Stef fie v. Thorap son in which there was a stay in the
pending State action at the time the Federal actions were
brought and through the time they were finally decided.
QUESTION?

You also asked for an injunction.

MR. COCHRAN:

We did ask for an injunction before.

We are not pursuing that further at this time.
QUESTION:

Steffie ultimately turned on the fact

that there was no pending proceeding in the State court at the
time the district court action was brought, didn’t it?
Because Samuels v. Macke1 says that the Younger rule applies
to a declaratory judgment when there is a pending State
procedure.
MR. COCHRAN; I

believe the determination in

13
Steffie was that there was not a pending State proceeding
because there was a stay in the State court, and that is the
same situation we have here.
Turning to the perhaps most basic contention which
we made below that the Connecticut statute invades the rights
of privacy in the sense of autonomy and family self-determination,
this Court has recogxiised such a right as a basic constitutional
right in an unbroken line of cases beginning with Meyer v.
Nebraska and on through Stanley v. Illinois.
Now, the majority opinion below did not
QUESTION:

Doesn't your privacy claim have something

to do with the power of the State which you conceded to bring
this action independently?

Would such an action not invade

privacy to exactly the same extent as —•
MR. COCHRAN:

It would not to quite the same extent.

I think it would invade privacy.
QUESTION:

Why wouldn't it be to the same extent

except that there wouldn’t be any contempt sanction against
this particular person, and that’s really not a privacy aspect,
is it?
MR. COCHRAN:

No, that's not.

There in fact might

be a contempt if the mother failed to respond to a subpoena
which was issued by the State in that situation.
be a civil contempt.
rules»

That would

It would be not governed by the same

14

Here we are attempting to safeguard the mother’s
right to keep secret the identity of the father.

Once that

is gone, then the issue becomes somewhat different.
QUESTION:

Did you say the right of the mother to

safeguard the secrecy?
MR. COCHRAN:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

Where does that right originate?

MR. COCHRAN:

Well, that is the only way that the

mother can exercise whctfc we think is the basic right of
determining whether it is in the child's best interest and in
her best interest to bring a paternity action.
QUESTION:

The district court decided both the

statutory conflict issue and the constitutional question.
MR. COCIIRAN:
QUESTION:

Both against you.

MR. COCIIRAN:
QUESTION:

Correct.

Yes, it did.

(And as I read your brief here, you

suggested the conflict issue, the preemption issue or the
so-called statutory issue is different than it was because of
the amended statute.
MR. COCHRAN:

It. is somewhat different.

X think

it is
QUESTION:

That's quite an argument that it is

different and that the Connecticut act even if it didn't
collide with the old act, if collided with the amended one.

15

MR. CQCIIRAN:
QUESTION;

I think that's true, but I think —-

Isn't that your argument?

MR. COCHRAN;

My argument is that it makes it clearer

that it conflicted right along and still does.
QUESTION;

Why shouldn't we then ask the district

court to address itself to this question in the first instance
because that might dispose of the whole case for you and it
might help us avoid a constitutional issue like

it helped the

Connecticut court.
MR. COCHRAN:

Well, ray answer to that is that, while

of course that could be done, we would not favor it because
there are a large number of these petitions being filed at all
times in Connecticut courts, and that would involve a
considerable risk of exposure for the future to a number of
these mothers who have not yet been cited under this statute.
QUESTION;

You mean it would delay things.

MR. COCHRAN:

It would delay things.

And there's

a second reason --QUESTION;

But we might decide against you and the

district court, might decide for you.
MR. COCHRAN:
QUESTION:

I recognise that possibility.

This would gi.ve you two swings at it, you

see»
MR. COCHRAN:

I am saying that this Court cannot or

should not if it chooses to remand the case.

I believe that

16

that would be unnecessary, and I would point out. one further
point.

The district court did not address in any substantive

way what I think is our basic contention here about the mother's
right

to determine the course of the family fortunes„

And

that is a very important point for interpretation of the
Social Security Act.
without

citing

The district court simply dismissed that

authority or really any rational basis for

it whatsoever.
The concurring opinion in the district court,on the
other hand, upheld the mother’s right, subject to the same
sort of limitations which exist on all parental rights.
QUESTION^

So you do have a friend on the district

court that might insist on serious consideration.
MR. COCHRAN:

I don't know that X would put it that

way, but we do have an opinion which agrees with this
contention, that is correct.
QUESTION:

Mr. Cochran, suppose one of the appellants

had abandoned any claim to AFDC benefits after this suit was
instituted.

Could you have had the suit dismissed at that

time ?
MR. COCHRAN:
QUESTION:

I don't believe so.

Suppose the mother simply said, well,

rather than provide the information which the State desires,
I will just discontinue making any claim for welfare benefits.
What would have happened?

17
MR. COCHRAN:

The statute on its face appears to rae

to apply to that situation because the mother would have been
receiving benefits from the time she was cited with the
contempt citation.

There are, however, at least some instance

in which that was not done by the circuit court.
QUESTION;

Has there been any construction by

Connecticut courts that would shed any light as to the answer
to my question?
MR. COCHRAN:

There has been construction in the

courts of some of the hearings under this statute.
not been a written opinion.

There has

Those hearings seem to divide on

that issue.
QUESTION:

But if the statute clearly provided that

if the mother abandons any right to the welfare benefits, she
would not be required to respond to these inquiries, would you
have any objection constitutionally to that statute?
MR. COCHRAN;

Yes, I believe we would.

The mothers

here and presumably a large number of the class of mothers are
recipients of State assistance and would continue to foe -so.

I

think the basic point to make here is that the Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare in interpreting the Social
Security Act have uniformly required methods of administration
which do not violate the privacy and dignity of welfare
recipients.

That requirement

seems to me to incorporate

the constitutional arguments we are making here and to make

18

anything which is a violation of the basic right of — I
see my time is up — of privacy to be a violation of the
Social Security Act as well.
In sum, I think this statute clearly does show a
punitive intent towards mothers of illegitimate children by
the fact that it does not apply and there is nothing comparable
applying to any other parents of any other class of children.
That's not a legitimate purpose, and I do think that the case
could be reversed.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Cochran.

Mr. Rosen.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID N. ROSEN

ON BEHALF

OF CHILDREN APPELLANTS
MR. ROSEN:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I want to say one word on the abstention question

before 1 get into the substance of the argument that I am
making here on behalf of the children of appellants, which is
that in addition to the problem that Connecticut lower courts
really do have a doctrine that they will decline in circumstances
in which constitutional adjudication might seem to be
\

appropriate to make that adjudication, and in addition to the
second fact that —
QUESTION:
is that it?

If they can get a Federal court to do it,

13
MR. ROSEN;

Well, that's the position taken in this

case, but. in general the courts have, to the bemusement of
Connecticut practitioners as well perhaps as this Court, said
that they have a restricted or almost nonexistent jurisdiction
to decide the merits of constitutional questions.
QUESTION:
MR. ROSEN:
QUESTION:

Do trial courts take this view?
Yes, they do, Your Honor.
I've heard that in administrative agencies,

but I never heard that of a court.
MR. ROSEN:

I have never heard it of any other

court, but I have heard it —
QUESTION:

So that a criminal case, if the statute had

to be construed, you can never convict the man, you would just
let him stay there?
MR. ROSEN:
QUESTION:
MR. ROSEN:

Ho, the position, as I understand it ~~
What do you do?
The position as I take it of the

Connecticut lower courts is that the statute is applied and if
unconstitutional, is construed as unconstitutional only by a
Connecticut appellate e:ourt.
QUESTION:

Well, why in this case did they hold this

MR. ROSEN:

The Connecticut courts did not construe

ona up?

the statute to be — have not addressed themselves to the
constitutionality of the statute.

QUESTION?

But there is a court in Connecticut that

will pass on the statute, which is —
MR. ROSEN;
QUESTION:

The Connecticut Supreme Court.
As this particular case now stands, there

is no way for the Supreme Court of Connecticut to decide this
case.

Am I right?
MR. ROSEN:
QUESTION;
MR. ROSEN;

Your honor, as this case now stands —
Am I right?
Because the petitions are stayed, you

are right, Mr. Justice Marshall.
QUESTION;

In all other States we go up through the

State supreme court up to this Court, but in Connecticut we
take a short circuit and go on over to the Federal court
with the cooperation of both the State court and the plaintiff.
MR. ROSEN:
QUESTION;

And the State.
Short circuits the State court and denies

us the opportunity of getting the opinion of the State court
on one of its own statutes.
MR. ROSEN;
QUESTION:

It seems to me -Am I right?

Am I correct?
i

MR. ROSEN;

That would be the impact of that

statute, but it would not -QUESTION;

That would be the impact on this particular

statute as applied in this particular case.
MR. ROSEN:

Mr. Justice Marshall

21
QUESTION:

There is no way for us to get a definitive

opinion from the Supreme Court of Connecticut as to its own
statute.
MR„ ROSEN:

Mr. Justice Marshall» if this Court

abstains at this point, you will not get that adjudication and
that1s the point that I wanted to make,
if tliis Court were to abstain

It seems to me that

today, what would happen would

be that the named plaintiffs in this case would be faced with
an immediate judgment of civil contempt involving their
incarceration.
QUESTION;
MR. ROSEN:

And they could appeal.
Well, they could not appeal.

There is a

statutory proceeding for removal —
QUESTION:

Well, whatever it is, they can get their

constitutional question decided.
MR. ROSEN:

Yes, your Honor, except that the point

that I want to make from the perspective of my clients, which
are the children of those appellants —
QUESTION:

Well, the judgment might be stayed while

they are appealing.
MR. ROSEN;

It might be stayed.

the judgment, might not be stayed.

The problem is that

From the perspective of my

clients, who are the children of the mothers, in the event that
the judgment is not stayed, the mothers will ba under what will
in all likelihood be an irresistible pressure to do one of two

22
things* give the name or dissimulate in some way , but in any
event not to serve the jail sentence while the case is being
appealed.

And from the perspective of my clients, who are

the children -QUESTION;

Would you say the district court in

Connecticut, the United States district court, might have
jurisdiction in habeas corpus cases if they confined them
under a contempt order of the State court?
MR. ROSEN;

That would pose the same problem.

That

would bring this case up through the Federal courts again
without going up through the State court.system.
QUESTION;
MR. ROSEN:

Mot necessarily.

Not necessarily.

You are referring to the possibility of

habeas versus stay while the case is appealed through the
State courts.
QUESTION.?
MR. ROSEN;
QUESTION;

Right.
They might have that jurisdiction.
That's been dons many times in many

States.
MR. ROSEN;

But it would involve my clients being

subjected to a risk that their mothers would be unable to
resist the compulsion of the State.

And my clients, the

children, do not have control over their mothers’ ability
to resist such compulsion.
Let me speak about what, from the perspective of the

23
chil&ren, is the central issue in this case,
QUESTION:

Let me ask you just one more question

about the subject we have just been on, Mr,, Rosen.

When you say

that the Connecticut lower court had this policy, is this
Connecticut lower court of limited jurisdiction, or does the
Connecticut superior court have that policy, the trial court,
of general jurisdiction?
MR. ROSEN:

The policy is related to the fact that

the court of common pleas

and the Connecticut circuit court,

which are the courts that we are dealing with here, are courts
of limited jurisdiction, and that has been construed, and I
will not comment on the appropriateness of that instruction,
to limit the court's jurisdiction to consider constitutional
questions as the jurisdiction of an administrative agency
is familiarly limited.
QUESTION:

Is this by constitution of Connecticut?

MR. ROSEN:

It is a judicial construction of the

Connecticut constitution which —
QUESTION:

Where is it so I can read it, what you

just told me it says.
MR. ROSEN: Well, the leading cases are two cases called
?
?
State v. Townsend and State v. Muolo, and with the Court's
permission, a supplemental submission on the extension question
which has not been raised, as we say, previously would give
us aa opportunity to express our views on that point.

24

QUESTION:

I don’t need it for myself, and I can

only speak for myself, because I just don't believe Connecticut
has deprived this Court of an opportunity to have a State
court decision deciding the constitutionality of a State
statute.

I don't think Connecticut can deny us that right.
MR. ROSEN:

1 am sure, your Honor, that you are right

as a matter of constitutional law.
QUESTION:
MR. ROSEN:
QUESTION;

Why are you arguing the other way?
No.

I am arguing it only as a matter of

Of what your understanding of the

Connecticut lav/ is.
MR. ROSEN:

MR. ROSEN:
QUESTION:

Right.
You are not arguing that it’s right.
That's right.
But you did raise all the questions in

the State case.
MR. ROSEN:
point

The Stats case has never proceeded to a

where those questions might be raised.
QUESTION:

Well, then, X understood — did the

gentleman, Mr. Cochran, say that all of the points were raised
in the State case?
MR. ROSEN:

I understand him to say they may have

been raised formally or informally.
QUESTION;
MR, ROSEN:

Well, this is your case.
Yes, your- Honor, but the State case was

I was appointed by the United

States district court to represent the class of children in
the Federal case, but in any event the

I will go into it for you.

I'll let you

know o
MR. ROSEN:

Thank you, sir.

May I address the merits for a moment from the
perspective of the children of appellants which is that,Mr.
Justice Rehnquist, your statement before the statute applies
to all children is correct with a reservation that the
procedural mechanism of the statute provides that for children
who are not on welfare, the proceedings against the mother
can be instituted if and only if there is a determination
that instituting those proceedings will servo the best interest
of tiie children.

Whereas, with children on welfare, that

determination is not made.
Now, the distinction arises in the following way:
a proceeding may be brought in the case of a child not on
welfare only by a guardian or a guardian ad litem of the child.
Now, what this means first is that a court must determine that
the best interest of the child will be served by appointment
of a guardian or guardian ad litem-,

Second, the guardian

or guardian ad litem prosecuting the action to compel the
mother to give the name is required by fiduciary obligations
to act only in the interest of the child.

By contrast, the

26

Welfare Department, the Welfare Commissioner, the defendant
in this case, is empowered to bring actions against children
who are on ^^?elfare.

It is his policy stipulated in the record

and brought out in the evidence to bring those actions against
each and every woman on welfare who fails to make disclosure
whether or not the best interests of that woman’s child would
be served.

So the poor child, the child on welfare, that is to

say, gets no protection of the child's interest, and the child
who is not on welfare is insured by the procedural mechanism
by which the proceedings are brought that the proceedings
will be brought if and only if those interests are served and
will be pursued only insofar as those interests are served.
Mr. Cochran has alluded to the harm that may come to
the children I represent as a result of bringing disclosure
proceedings where the interests of the child might not ba
served.

Those harms are very serious, and they are set out in

the record.
In the short time remaining I won't give you too many
examples of them, but, for example, a mother may be establishing
a relationship with a prospective stepfather or adoptive father
which might be interrupted by bringing the proceedings.

A

Woman who gave an affidavit below was the named plaintiff in
a companion case risked disfellowship from her church should
the fact. that, she was the mother of an illegitimate child
become known.

In those cases a guardian or guardian ad litem

27
of the child might have decided that, bringing the action would
not serve the child’s interest
the action.

and would not have brought

But the Commissioner of Welfare will bring the

action because the Commissioner of Welfare has determined
to

bring

action in each and every case.
Wow, the justification offered by the State for the

distinction —* first, there is the obvious distinction between
children on welfare and children not on welfare that the
State argues a more substantial recoupment interest in the
case of children on welfare.
As to that, let me say first that that distinction
has no rational relationship to the precise discrimination
worked by the statute, because the precise discrimination
worked by the statute deprives the child on welfare of any
representation as a matter of right in the proceedings which
will determine whether or not the mother has to make
disclosure.

The child who is not on welfare has that

protection and has a guardian ad litem under the statutory
procedure, and the proceeding cannot be brought without it.
So that the child who is on welfare doesn’t have a spokesman,
doesn't have a representative of his interest? while a child
who is not on welfare does.

Whatever balance the Court may

strike between the interest of the State in recoupment, the
interest of the mother in privacy, the interests of the
child and protection of the child's interests is not related

28
at all to the question as to whether the child5s interests are
entitled to have a voice at that proceeding when the child is
poor s if they are given a voice when the child is not on
welfare.

And that's the discrimination worked by the statute.
Now, in addition, we talk in our brief, and I won't

be3.abor the point here, about the importance of the child's
rights, and our position there is simply that the State’s
financial interest cannot in any event justify abandoning the
child's rights and interests in the case of children who are
on welfare when those interests are pursued and protected when
the child is not on welfare.
The State's primary justification for the statutory
scheme is that disclosure serves the interests of all children,
on welfare and not on welfare, and the compulsion is good for
the child.

To this the reply is so it may be in some cases,

but it is frequently not the case.

The evidence in the record

below was powerful that it is not in many cases.

Unrebutted

expert testimony we produced from very distinguished experts
was that it was quite frequently not -the case, that compelling
the mother in instances in which she didn't want to make
disclosure might hurt the child.
any event, when seen from the perspective of
what we consider to be a rationality of the other State interest,
the recoupment interest, this claim that the best interests
of the child are what is advanced amounts to an irrebuttable

29

presumption contrary to fact# an irrebuttable presumption that
the interests of the child will be served although the child
is denied in the hearing a guardian or guardian ad litem if
the child is on welfare to attempt to show that those interests
will not be served.

It's an irrebuttable presumption that the

child8 s interests will be served which is belied by the record
below.

It is in short an irrebuttable presumption which the

State applies selectively.

It applies it selectively to

children who are on welfare, but it does not apply the
irrebuttable presumption that disclosure and compulsion always
serves the child’s interests in the case of children who are
not on welfare.
In short, this is a statute which in the name of
the best interests of the child, which has been the State's
claim, all -the way through as to the point of the statute, in
fact deprives a subclass of those children, those illegitimate
children,of an opportunity to have their bast interests
voiced and have their best interests be determinative.
QUESTION:

You think the interests of children

generally in Connecticut are implicated in the necessity for
keeping tills fund solvent and keeping Connecticut in a position
to pay these benefits?
MR. ROSENs
interest.

Certainly children in general have such an

With respect to how that interest is served in

this case, it seems to me first that the interests of an

30
individual child where that interest is threatened and
endangered should not be forced to give way fco a speculative
interest on behalf of chi3_dren in general

and the State6 s

financial solvency»
QUESTION;
MR, ROSEN;

You say speculative interest,
Well, I say it's speculative interest

because the record below indicates that Connecticut Welfare
Department has made no study of the amount of money that they
recoup under this statute,
QUESTION;

Would you need to make any studies to

know that if you pay this money out without recoupment,it1s
going to have an impact on the funds?
MR. ROSEN;

Yes,, but the thing that you might have

fco study is how much money you will get back by pursuing the
small class of women who resist disclosure of the name of the
putative father even when told by the Welfare Department the
possible benefits which might come up.

That's the money that's

being lost, and the record indicates that the money that is
going to be recouped by the State of Connecticut is rather
small, in fact, it9s extremely small because of the fact that
fathers may be absent, fathers may not be available, fathers
may be impecunious, and all those factors, by the way, are
factors which the mother or the guardian of the child can
attempt to elicit in determining whether the interests of the
child will be served by going after the father*

If there is

31
a father who has money, who has resources, the interest of the
child may be served by pursuing that father.

If there is a

father whose whereabouts are unknown or who is incarcerated
or if he is impecunious, the guardian may make the same
determination that the interests of the child, if there are
important countervailing interests suggesting that the mother8s
decision not to disclose ought to be respected, the financial
interests also would not be strong.
QUESTIONS

MR. ROSEN:
QUESTION:

Congress probably thought different.
I think not, your Honor'.

Congress —

Well, they went to an awful lot of trouble

to require the State to have sms plans in this area.
MR. ROSEN:
QUESTION;
MR. ROSEN:

Yes, they did.

The reason that I —

Not for a negligible reason, I hope.
No, I think not.

But the plans, first

of ail apply to that large class of women, the record indicates
is somewhere around 70 percent that make disclosure voluntarily
without any suggestion, much less compulsion, and the 'thrust
of the congressional plan, as I understand it, is to improve
the enforcement mechanism.

The Senate Finance Committee which

drafted the nev; congressional enactment said that the
committee feels the mechanism should be provided to ascertain
the child,’ s paternity whenever it seems that this would be
both possible and in the child's best interests.
page 6 of Mr. Cochran's supplemental brief.

That's on

32
QUESTION;

Well, if you should succeed in removing

all the compulsion and coercion to -the disclosure of the name
of the father, maybe there wouldn’t be 70 percent who would
voluntarily or apparently voluntarily submit.

Maybe there would

only be 10 percent or 2 percent.
MR. ROSENs

Well, except, Mr. Chief Justice, that

as I read the record that is a figure, the 70 percent maltes
disclosure before the fact of compulsion is brought home to
the women.

And also, I am not opposing compulsion, that's

not my position.

My position is that compulsion is warranted

in the interests of the child, and I have a position even more
cautious than that, which is that the statute is unconstitutional
because it providas not even a voice for the poor child so
that those interests may be brought home to the Connecticut
judge who has to determine whether to enforce the compulsion,
while for the child who is not on welfare, those interests are
represented and are dispositive-

QUESTIONS

If the Connecticut court reads this statute

in order to say that from the constitutional attack mat you
suggest, reads this statute so as to require the appointment
of a guardian ad litem, then your point is gone, isn't it?
They haven't got around to that issue yet.
MR. ROSEN:
QUESTION:

Well, that's true.
And you haven't

I shouldn't say "you" --

your colleague hasn't let the Connecticut court get around to

33
that issue.
MR. ROSEN:

Well, except that there is still an

important distinction, even were the guardian to be appointed
in the case of all children, the distinction is still that
rich children who are not on welfare, the guardian not only
appears for the child, but controls the proceeding, institutes
the proceeding, and may withdraw the proceedings when and only
when tiie interests of the child dictates.

And it's that

discrimination which seems to me to violate the rights of a
subclass of illegitimate children, namely, those illegitimate
children who are on welfare.
Thanh you.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rosen, before you

sit down, you earlier in your argument volunteered to submit
a brief supplementary memorandum on this whole question of
the Younger question and including the practice of the
inferior courts in Connecticut never to decide or to avoid
deciding constitutional issues, and so on.

That would be vary

helpful froiti my point of view, so with the approval of the
Chief Justice, I would appreciate the submission of such a
memorandum within a brief period if you can conveniently do so.
MR. ROSENs

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Rosen, will you do

so within — will five days be enough, or do you want ten?
MR. ROSENs

I would like ten, your Honor.

34
QUESTION:

Mr» Rosen, suppose the Attorney General

of Connecticut gets up and says, "X waive ail my rights under
Younger," you are offering to do a lot of work for nothing.
MR. ROSEN:

Well, in that case I would address

myself to what this Court’s role should be —
QUESTION:
MR. ROSEN:
QUESTION:

In that case, you are
That8 3 right.
On the other hand, what if he says, "I

didn’t urge it in the district court, but I certainly urge
it here."
ME. ROSEN:

Then I would write a slightly different

memorandum.
QUESTION:
MR. ROSEN;

What would you say then?
What I would say then is that where my

clients’ rights, the children's rights are jeopardized by what
I refer to as a silent extinguishment of their rights, an ~
QUESTION:

You are going to say that Younger doesn’t

apply then.
MR. ROSEN:
QUESTION:

That's right.
You wouldn't say that he has already waived

it.
MR. ROSEN;

Well, X would also say he has already

waived it because you gave that suggestion to me.
(Laughter.)
QUESTION:

There is a further factor that this might

35
lead the court to reexamine its views about whether this is
waivable* the abstention question may he waived by the State.
So in any event, you submit whatever memorandum you like, and
your friends will have an opportunity to respond.

You can

respond within eight days, will you?
MR. ROSEN:

Thank you, your Honor.

It's apparent

that, I will need every day.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

MR. ARCARI:

T. at that time was not in charge of this

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

The root of the problem in this matter, of course,

is the identity of the putative father.

In Shirley v. Lavine,

that's in 365 F. Supp. 818, this case is very much unlike that
case in the sense that Shirley y. Lavine, the mothers involved
in that 'particular case were asked to go beyond to identify
the putative father and take further actions against the
putative father, to institute a paternity action.
have that problem here.

We don't

All the Connecticut statute is

interested in is learning the identity of the putative father
and that's all.

The State is equipped to take its own

independent action against the putative father to establish

37
paternity and call the mother in as a witness# as provided by
law.
Also not involved in this matter is the reduction of
AFBC benefitso

That's clearly not involved in our case»

Of coursep the first step is utilising section
52-440b in order to learn the identity of the putative father
if the mother voluntarily refuses to disclose the narae.
We maintain that in Connecticut our paternity laws#
including section 32-44Ob# are civil# including the contempt
provision.
Now#.the paternity laws in our State do provide
fifth amendment immunity and therefore the mothers’ rights
in this matter are not jeopardized in that sense.
primary purpose of

The

Connecticut -s -comprehensive scheme here

is the protection of children.

Collection of money from

putativa fathers is an important interest# it's a substantial
interest.

Nevertheless# that is not the prim,ary purpose of our

laws in relation to paternity# and that includes 52™44Ob.
Of course# we recite in our brief that there has been
a trend to create a balance between illegitimate children and
legitimate children so that rights equal out here.

In other

words# we have some cases declaring that the Social Security
benefits should be awarded to children under ~ illegitimate
children under the Social Security Act as well as their BA
benefits that they are entitled to today# and of course their

38

rights protected under the wrongful debt statutes of
illegitimate children, and the list goes on.
But there is also something else, too,, of significance
here, that there has been a trend, at least. I think, it's a
trend,, greater rights to the putativa father,

And this, of

course, is just .beginning in ray opinion., that there have been
State court cases in this area where the putativa father, for
instance, is given the right of custody over his child,,
especially if the mother has committed neglect or has become
deceased, and, of course, if the father can provide a home
and so forth.
Also, there is a case where it was decided that the
putative father, his consent must be obtained as far as
adoption is concerned.

So it's not a question of only support.

There are other rights.

The primary rights involved here are

of course the children’s, but there is the. putative father's
rights as well as the mother's.
We also point, out in our brief there are some practical
problems here.

For instance, applications.

Shouldn't

certainly the illegitimate child have the same right as a
legitimate child to fill in blank spaces on an application where
it. says ’'father"?

And this is the. whole, probably one of the

most practical problems we can point, out. to this Court.

We

also have in Connecticut inheritance laws and we have
section 45-274 which in effect says that an illegitimate child

39
may inherit from its natural mother with all the rights and
benefits as the legitimate child.

Again, this points up the

comprehensive — part of the comprehensive plan, in Connecticut
to protect the rights and further the rights of illegitimate
children along with legitimate children»
Now, we say the specific purpose of section 52-*440fo,
of course, is to, yes, learn the identity of the putative
father for the object of eventually obtaining support on
behalf of the child.

Again, we emphasise that's an important

purpose, but not the primary purpose.

The primary purpose,

of course, gets into the comprehensive scheme to protect the
children.

This is just one phase of it.
Now, the statute that we are talking about includes

all mothers with illegitimate children, contrary to our
opponents’ view here.

Now, we do have some statistics cited

4

in our briefs, and I don't believe that I will waste time
covering that, but I think we must understand that what it
boils down to is this;

That I think just as well as anyone

else’s rights are subject to control, constitutional rights
or any rights, the mother must have, there must be some
control of the mother’s rights in this type of a problem as
it bears on her child or children’s rights.

And this is

where section 52-440b comes in.
Now, v/e have claimed bv Idle appellants here that
the statute, Connecticut statute, is in conflict

40
with the Social Security Act.

It was pointed out in. the lower

court that quite to the contrary? the Social Security Act?
specifically 42 U.S.Code 602(a)(17)(a)(1) and (2) give a
frank recognition of the importance of establishing the
paternity of an illegitimate child not only for financial
reasons? but for the primary purpose of the Social Security Act
to ensure that the child was brought up in an environment# in
a family-type life# family-type setting.
Nowt our statute is merely drawn to carry out the
purposes of the Social Security Act# as I just related.
On February 10 we received a copy of the typewritten supplemental
brief discussing Public Law 93-647# part (b)»

Again contrary

to our opponents in this matter# I don't believe that the
amendments by Congress in relation to the Social Security Act
favor our opponents in any way whatsoever.

Quite to the

contrary# I think they enhance the State's position here in
this respect:

First of all# looking at the amendments# the

amendments still incorporate the provision of the old social
security lav/# in other words# section 602 (a) {.!?)# that is the
State plan must have provision in it to establish the
paternity of'an illegitimate child.
What the amendments actually did# in my opinion# is
to add provisions to the Social Security Act, adding these
two provisions;

That the mother# as s condition of eligibility#

the mother must cooperate with the welfare authorities in

41
establishing paternity and helping to secure support for the
children.

Of course, cooperation must be construed the

identity of the father, the need to get over -that basic
threshold»
Now, I read a clear intent in Congress saying that
if the mother elects not to disclose the name of the putative
father under the most recent amendments, that she can be
cut from welfare assistance.

I think what Congress is saying

is, all right, if she wants to exercise that right, she is
off assistance, she is out of the protection of the Social
Security

Act.

Her children remain under the protection of

the Social Security Act.
Nov;, as X understand, trying to analyse my opponents’
view on this thing, if the mother is removed from the
protection c£ the Social Security Act, then certainly I don’t
think Congress intended that the State may not act under
section 52-440b and apply it against the mother here who is
no longer under assistance.

After all, the State still has

an obligation to protect the children that are left on welfare
assistance under the Social Security Act.
In short, I don’t think we have a statutory conflict
because of that reason.
If I may move on to the right of privacy, our
position is there is no fundamental rights involved here.
if
Our opponents discuss that/the mother is forced to disclose

tiie name of the putative father, this gets into an area that's
embarrassing to her, it interferes with the most intimate
details of her life,

We maintain no, that, first of all from

the practical side, when the mother has an illegitimate child,
these facts become known, partially anyway, to the community
around her.

And I don't care if she goes out. of State to have

her child, when she comes back to the community, the community,
her neighbors, no doubt will find out that, she had an
illegitimate child through one process or another.
So if there is any harm here, it has been done.

It

doesn't certainly involve the State.
We say also that the inquiry does not go into so-called
the intrusion into the home.

It does not interfere with

interpersonal decision on the part of the mother or anyone
else she knows, nor does it judge — nor are we setting
ourselves up through the statute to judge the mother's misconduct
if it is misconduct.

We are not forbidding the mother to have

a man in the house or in the bedroom, for that matter-

&gainf

it's very limited in the sense that all we want is the identity
of the father and no more.
that point.

She doesn’t have to testify beyond

That is,as far as the contempt proceedings are

concerned.
Now, even if we recognise that the mother does have
some rights here
QUESTION:

Under the statute, if then paternity

43
proceedings are brought, she would have to testify if she was
subpoenaed, wouldn’t she?
MR. ARCARI:
QUESTION:

That's correct, your Honor.
And again under sanction of a possible

contempt if she didn't.
MR. ARCARI:

That’s correct, she is subject to the

same laws as any other witness, your Honor.

But she does have

the right of immunity of the fifth amendment immunity and so

forth.
QUESTION:
MR. ARCARI:

As any other witness would.
That's correct, your Honor.

Now, as I say, the mother does have some rights in
this matter.

W® point to Roe v. Wade, and I think the

significant thing in Roe v. Wade, this Court, of coarse,
recognised that at some point in time the unborn child, the
unborn fetus, acquires rights.

And at that point the mother's

rights, rights to personal privacy, or what have you are not
full, that her rights have some bearing on her unborn child's
rights.

Certainly if we can use that principle, certainly

children that have been born have at least the same rights.
Now, what we are trying to persuade this Court on
is we must look at not only the rights individually from the
children’s or the mothers', let's put everyone''s rights in
a collective sense.

Going back a little bit into Connecticut's

history, Connecticut under the doctrine of parens patriae

of course recognised the protection of children.
gone much further than that.

But it lias

Connecticut courts have made the

children's interests paramount,, and it has even gone farther
than that by saying that we will protect children's rights in
every way possible, and that includes illegitimate children,
of course.
Now, Connecticut has also even gone so far as to
alter the family relationship when one or both parents have
caused neglect.

And, of course, that is a proceeding usually

in the juvenile court, the probate court, and this is

well"

defined cases,
Of course, I might point out that Connecticut .never
adopted the law of England which recognised the illegitimate
child to foe the child of no one.

Right from the beginning

Connecticut recognized that the child is the child of its
natural mother with all the rights and benefits that
legitimate children have.
Now, as I said, I pointed out to this Court that
support is an important function here, but it is not the
primary reason.

I can’t emphasise that too much.

QUESTION?
MR. ARCARI:
QUESTION;

Mr. Attorney General.
Yes, your Honor.
In that connection let’s assume you have

a mother who is quite wealthy and has always supported her
own child.

If I understand your position, the State would

45
proceed against her in the same way.
MR. ARCARI:

Is that correct?

It is my opinion, that the State should.

Let me point out# your Honor# that our department is concerned
with welfare matters# so if we didnBt have a welfare interest,
that is# a child was not on assistance# our division of the
Attorney General's office would not proceed against her.
Possibly same other division could.
QUESTION:

The statute by its terms provides for

three subclasses# and one of the subclasses is not conditioned
on receipt of welfare at all.
MR. ARCARI:
QUESTION:

Do you agree with that?

I agree with that# your Honor, and I
So the statute would apply in the

situation I described#1 would it not?
MR. ARCARI:
QUESTION:

Yes# if would# your Honor.
It would apply.

Now, suppose in this case that one of the mothers
had relinquished all rights to future welfare for the child
in question and had offered to repay whatever she had
received.

Would the State continue to have prosecuted her

under this contempt proceeding# or would it have withdrawn
the prosecution?
MR. ARCARI:

No, if she refuses to disclose the name

of the putative father under the circumstances.
QUESTION:

In other words# if she refused to disclose

the name of the father# she would be prosecuted.

46
MR. ARCARI;

1 believe# yes# the statute still would

apply to her# your Honor.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

MR. ARCARI;

What we maintain is involved as far as

the appellant mothers is that#
so forth.

y©3#

they may suffer from shock#

Of course# they do this at their own hand.

They

are the ones forcing the issue here as far as being brought
into court.

The appellant mothers bring up the question of

strains and stresses upon their children.

In fact# that's

their principal argument here.
This argument gives little recognition to the stresses
and strains on the children who are not able to find out or
identify their fathers.

There is some testimony on the way

of cross-examination# I believe it's part of the record and it
can speak for itself.

Let's keep one thing in mind# that the

illegitimate child must function in the community just as well
as the legitimate cild.
to go in our society.

That child# any child# has a long way
And 1 think the State can't do enough

to bring the illegitimate child's rights in balance with the'
legitimate child's rights.
QUESTION;

Mr. Arcari# are there statute of limitations

in Connecticut on a paternity suit?
MR. ARCARI:
Yes# your Honor.

Are 'there statute of limitations?

First of all, there is a three-year statute

of limitations and also I believe it's one year if the putative

47
father ceases supporting the child, and also under the marriage
and divorce laws or dissolution of marriages, there is a oneyear provision, one-year statute of limitations if a child
is found not to be

issue of the marriage during the

dissolution of the marriage»
QUESTION:

If the statute had run in a particular

case, would the State still insist on divulgenee of identity?
MR. APjCARI:

I don't believe so because we have •—

I think that's somewhat of a practical problem, too.

I don't

believe so because you may have a. situation where the child
is 17, 15 years old and the statute of limitations all the way
across the board have run, and if there is no welfare involved
we are trying to collect back or something of this nature, I
don't believe the State would press the matter.

I think the

guardian ad litem may have an interest, but. that's up to the
guardian ad litem to represent the child.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose the child were six or five

or four.
MR. ARCARX s
QUESTION:

And is welfare -^involved in it?
Yes.

And you spoke of a three-year

period.
MR. ARCARI:
your Honor, we cannot.

If the statute of limitations has run,
That would be part of the defense

and in my opinion it would be, from what I know about paternity
matters, that would be a. good defense.

QUESTION:

I am just suggesting that might be a case

where clearly the rights of privacy would outweigh any interests
on the part of the State.
MR. ARCAF.X %

That may very well be, but I sm going to

get to this a little bit further on.
assume

The mother involved I

is in a position to bring up those rights, and I think

she may very well persuade the court that she happens to be
dealing with at that time.
We also have a claim on violcition of due process of
law.

We talked somewhat of the substantive part of it, I

think, of section 52-44Ob in relation to due process.

In other

words, we maintain it is rationally related to carry out. the
purposes of protecting the child and in gaining support, and so
forth.

But the procedure involved certainly the object, as I

pointed out before, of the Connecticut statute is to learn the
identity to eventually obtain support.

That certainly is

within the Government9s scope to compel testimony, and my
understanding, the only constitutional restriction of the scope
pf; the Government’s power to compel testimony is the fifth
amendment.

And we did make provision in other parts of our law

for. that.
What the opponents bring up are these four things,
that the statute creates an irrebuttable presumption and that
there is no individualised hearing

I taka that to mean a

trial type hearing — also, there are not sufficient standards

49
under due process of lav; and the statute is too broad.
First of all, looking at section 52-440b

,

the statute

says wnen disclosure is to be made, under what circumstances,
and to whom, and the subject matter is quite restricted, if
the mother fails or refuses to disclose the name of the
putative father of such child under oath.

That is the subject

matter of the Act involved here.
Now, once the court, the court of common pleas, now,
gets by that first set of standardsthen under the contempt
proceedings in Connecticut it must eventually apply these
standards:

Who is making the demand here, under what

circumstances, whether there is a refusal to be sworn or to
refuse to disclose, whether the refusal is justified in law,
whether it is a question that is proper, and whether the
proper question is reasonably related to the subject matter
inquiry.

And, of course, the court of common pleas in a

contempt proceeding has the power to hear witnesses and even
undertake — or hear defenses on behalf of the mother.
Now, also through the contempt hearing itself,
obviously due process of law applies here.

In other words, the

mother will be protected as far as any excessive means, in
other words, of the State to extract evidence from her.

In

other words, what I am getting at is this will take care of
tne appellants* fourth amendment argument here.
Also, under the statute, legal process also applies.

50
In other words, no one can just drag the mother off the
street here.

A citation must be issued, and she is ordered to

show cause why she should not be held in contempt as far as
disclosing the name of the putative father.

She has the

QUESTION:

This has always been handled in the

court of common pleas initially , or has that been a recent step?
MR. ARCARI:

It is my understanding that the cases

involved in this particular case have been pending for about a
year or so.

In other words, the procedure as taken place in

the court of common pleas is not too oldAnd I think all the
cases are pending.

I don't think

they are going forward;

they are waiting to see what happens to this, case.
QUESTION;

And that's your court of general trial

51
jurisdiction in Connecticut.
MR, ARCARIi

No, your Honor.

Right now our judicial

system is split up between the superior court and court of
j*

common pleas.

Both are trial courts, and it's well defined as

to which one has jurisdiction in certain cases.
QUESTION;

Does the court of common pleas have a mis­

demeanor type of court?
MR. ARCARI;

I believe, yes, your Honor.

Nov/, under

the new reorganization they do handle misdemeanors such as
traffic matters.
QUESTION;
MR. ARCARI;

It’s inferior, then, to the superior court.
I believe you could still classify it

that way, your Honor.
QUESTION:

And then does appeal from the court of

common pleas go to the Supreme Court of Connecticut or to the
superior court?
MR. ARCARI;

Well, again, that provision of appeal,

I'm not quite sure where the appeal would lie.

I believe the

appeal would still lie under the present Act, your Honor,
under the new Act, I should say, to the Supreme Court .

It's

my understanding that the contempt provisions you would still
go up to the State supreme court on that.
QUESTION;

Your brother on the other side said there

was some special statutory provision to review contempt, he
thought o

52
MR. ARCARI;
way:

Well, if I may answer that question this

It is my understanding there are two types of contempt.

If an act of contempt is committed before a court, statutory
standards apply.

Here we are having a mother brought in, which

means that common law standards apply.
Wow, as far as appealing from the court of common
pleas to the State supreme court, I believe the statute would
control the appeal, and I believe that is, in other words, the
statute would dictate the procedure involved.
Nottf, an important matter in this of significance is
that the court of common pleas has the power under the statute
to exercise sound judicial discretion, and this was pointed out
in the trial court here.
What do I mean by that?

There are three phases of if.

First of all, the court has the sound discretion to decide
whether to order contempt or not.

Two, even if it finds the

mother in contempt, it still has the discretion whether to
enforce penalty or not, to order penalty.

And also, about this

business about bringing, forcing the mother to bring ,
prosecute a paternity action, the court of common pleas still
has discretionary powers to do that.

We point out in our brief

that since we have other laws in the paternity sections of our
laws that allow the town or the State to bring a paternity
action, obviously, the court will exercise discretion and
suggest to the State that they bring independent actions rather

53

than trying to force a mother who is perhaps trying to resist
at that point to bring this action, because obviously this will
have an effect on the tryor of fact.
Also, I want to go to --- discussing all these standards
I pointed out to the Court, I don’t see how we can come to
the conclusion that in any way possible there is cruel and
unusual punishment under the eighth amendment of the United
States Constitution.

Individualised hearing.

I don't believe,

my understanding from reading some cases anyway, that due
process of law requires a trial type hearing in these proceed­
ings as far as the contempt under section 52~440b.

You have

to keep in mind appellants are not on trial for their conduct.
All they are being brought into court for is a limited inquiry
with sufficient safeguards under due process of law or what
have you.

This is not a prosecution type situation where

again their conduct comes into focus here and the court is
going to go beyond getting the identity of the putative
father.
The appellants bring up idle first amendment rights.
They claim that they have a right not to divulge this
information under the first amendment.

Of course, a first

amendment type argument, we have perhaps a high, standard
being applied here.

I would like to point out to tne Court

that the first amendment doesn't prohibit the State again
its power to compel testimony here, but it does obviously

54
restrict the States here.

And it is my understanding that if

the State's interest involved is cogent to justify abridging
the right of association or what have you* then in this case
the State's position should be upheld.
Wow, again, I want to emphasize that we believe our
position in this matter is compelling.

I think it's over­

whelming in the sense of protecting the rights of the illegitimate
children.

Certainly I point out before that in regard to the

appellant's argument that they have a right under the first
amendment not to resort to a court, and what they mean-by that
is again going back to the court of common pleas possibly
forcing the mother to bring a paternity action.
little bit of background about that.

I gave a

Certainly, the paternity

aspect of it, the prosecution of paternity suit, is not
compulsory under 52-440b.

Also, the contempt provisions are

not mandatory, and certainly our act does not force the
mother or any mother to adopt beliefs or attitudes anything
different from what they actually believe.
To come down to the equal protection claim here, and
of course, the lower court applied the rational standard here
which I think is a correct standard to apply.

We pointed out

in the beginning of this argument that the State's position
was that we have a comprehensive scheme and at the core that
comprehensive scheme is to protect and further the rights of
illegitimate children.

The means under section 52-440b to

55

protect those rights, learning the identity of the father is
certainly rationally related to carry out the provisions of
that comprehensive scheme and also any provisions under the
Social Security Act.
But commenting just a moment that I think we also
under that same argument have a compelling interest* as I
noted before* but talking about the classifications themselves*
our opponents bring up that there is a sex classification.
You have to keep in mind that men, yet do not bear children.
Women carry on that function.

And the point here is that we

have a ^/ery unique situation.

So I don't think in any serious

sense of the word you can take women in this type context and
say we have a suspect classification.
Also our opponents point out to this Court that they
believe there is a suspect classification as to poverty.
Again we pointed out before that our statute does not apply
simply to poverty or to women receiving AFDC benefits

or the

family as such,, they apply to, as I pointed out. to Justice
Powell, that it applies to people not receiving AFDC benefits
or any State welfare assistance,,

I don't think you can say

that poverty is a suspect classification.
It was brought up by Judge Biomenfeld in the lower
court that at that time the apt^ellants claim that children,
illegitimate children, were a suspect classification, and Judge
Blumanfeld quickly stated this is taking the classification and

56
standing it on its head, in the sense that section 52-44Oh is
designed to help the children not to detract from their rights
or benefits and therefore it fits in accordance with the
Social Security Act and also it is certainly rationally related
and not in violation of the equal protection of the laws.
If I may point out something, I emphasize again that
we do not have a criminal contempt involved as far as section
52“440b.

It's my understanding of the law that children in our

State are not unrepresented by guardian ad litem at certain
times, but also it is customary to appoint attorneys to
represent children.

I suppose unless there is a conflict of

interest, the guardian ad litem could be the attorney representing
tiie child, but they don't necessarily have to be.
The attorney representing the children involved in
this matter made a statement which says that as far as they
were concerned the Welfare Department, the welfare policy is
to bring aix action, and I underscored those words, bring an
action, against the mothers involved in order to get them to
disclose.

The State Welfare Department does not bring an action

against any mother receiving welfare assistance here.

They

take the information, the policy provides they take the
information, they review it, and if there is a problem involving
the identity of the father, we refer it over to outside counsel.
In short, they refer it to the court.

And everything that

goes on from that point on is under the supervision of the court

57
of common pleas under the statute itself.

And, of course, the

statute itself, as I point out in our argument, heavily controls
the court of common pleas here with stafficient standards.
Of course, our opponents mads quite a bit of the
financial interests of the State,
argument on this note s

I can probably end my

that certainly I admit to this tribunal

that the financial interests of the State is very substantial
here, but I still think that the primary interests involved
are the welfare of the children, the illegitimate children,
and so long as I'm a member of the Connecticut bar, I plan to
work towards that effort, even though I may find myself
collecting money from putative fathers.

That still hasn't

deterred me from keeping that principle uppermost

in my mind

as far as the protection and welfare of the children.

MR, ARCARI:

I believe the Welfare Department has

best way possible.
QUESTIONS

Is there any statute that compels the

married mother to disclose the whereabouts of the father?
MR. ARCARI:

I don't believe so, your Honor.

Usually,

for instance, we find that problem very much in divorce matters
and the dissolution of a marriage, and the courts will rely
on their equity powers to see if they can obtain the information.
Of course, before we get into the courts, the Welfare
Department and the Department of Finance Control have a location
unit, and we work with other States using the Social Security
