MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Sachse.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY R. SACHSE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. SACHSE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on writ of certiorari to the
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
The question presented by the case is whether a
requirement of a collective bargaining agreement that an
employee work not less than 25 v;eeks in the prior year to
receive a vacation can be used to prevent a returning
veteran from receiving a vacation in the year of his return
and in the year after his return.
The Court of Appeals held that the company could
deny vacations to veterans for failure to meet this 25 work­
week requirement.
It is our position that this interpretation keeps
a veteran from returning to his employment without loss of
seniority, status or pay and is in contravention of 50 USC
459, the Selective Service Act.
)

I have had a chart passed around which I have also
supplied to Opposing Counsel which I'll turn to in a minute

4
and I think will help clarify the — what really happened
in this case.
QUESTION:

Well, I think this is illustrative

only.
MR. SACHSE:
correct.

It is only illustrative, that is

I decided to use it instead of a big display that

seemed unwieldy.
QUESTION:
MR. SACHSE:
QUESTION:

It is a continuing escalator here.
That is right.
It is a picture of a continuing

escalator.
MR. SACHSE:
escalator principle

Well, we argue that a continuingshould apply in this case.

The contract in question has a 25 work-week require­
ment but as to veterans, this is all the contract says —
this is on — in the Appendix, page 48.

It says, ".An employee

inducted into the Armed Forces of the United States shall be
given the minimum reemployment rights granted him under the
Selective Service Act as amended."
The question then is —
QUESTION:

I am just curious, Mr. Sachse, I gather,

this being the Selective Service Act is only for a conscripted
army.
MR. SACHSE:
QUESTION:

No, that is not so.
Does it apply to the voluntary army?

5
MR. SACHSE:

It applies to reserve units and it

applies to volunteers —
QUESTION:

Well, how about —

MR. SACHSE:
QUESTION:

— in the Army.
It does?

MR. SACHSE:

Yes, it does.

QUESTION:

To the new Volunteer Army?

QUESTION:

Oh, yes.

QUESTION:

Volunteer, I suppose, inducted in the

same sense that a draftee is inducted, isn’t he?
MR. SACHSE:

Well, they are different sections of

the Act, but they apply the exact same rule.
QUESTION:

Anybody can say to his boss, I am going

to volunteer for the Army for two or three years but remember,
I am coming back.
MR. SACHSE:

That is right.

And the Act was passed

in 1941 with idea that a lot of people would be volunteering
and not just drafted and to encourage people to do so.
QUESTION:

Volunteering for a career in the Army?

Now, what if he says to his boss —
MR. SACHSE:
QUESTION:

— I am going to volunteer for 30 years.

MR. SACHSE:
years it applies.

No, no, they are —

No, there are limits on how many

If he is drafted, I think two years.

Volunteers — something.

I don't recall the details.

QUESTION:

But there are short —

MR. SACHSE:

There are limits there and there are

also limits on how quickly you have to reapply within 90
days of being released, you have to reapply on the same —■
QUESTION:

Well, I must say, the Military Selective

Service Act is a little misleading then, isn’t it?
MR. SACHSE:
QUESTION:

Well, that — it’s in an Appendix to to that Act?

MR. SACHSE:

Well , It is part of that Act but it -

but it covers more —
QUESTION:

Now, right now, if you volunteer for a

I don't want to make a definite

It — the Act applies —

QUESTION:
MR. SACHSE:

He is shaking his head that it does, yes
— to more than just draft.

I know

it applies to reserve units.
QUESTION:
Army,

If it didn't apply to the Volunteer

this would be just this case, wouldn’t it?
If the statute — If the decision here isn’t to

apply to volunteers.
MR. SACHSE:

Well, It’s really — it's just that it

it’s useless for me to speculate about i^hether it applies In

7
a pure volunteer situation.
There is no question in this case that it does
apply to this employee.
Now, if you’ll turn to the chart, 1511 show you
what happens with this employee and it is a fairly typical
situation.
He went to work on August 5th at the extreme left
of the chart.
vacation.

During the first 22

weeks he received no

During the next year he received a vacation of

approximately three days based on the amount of work in the
prior year under a provision that is only there for initial
employees.
During the next year, he had served enough so that
he was a full-fledged employee getting regular vacation pay
which is seven days is all they get, even in the third year.
But during that third year, he went into the Army —
into the Navy, actually, it was.
He begins almost two years of military service.
He is paid when he goes into the Navy his vacation benefits
earned up to that point so we have no quarrel about old —
about benefits prior to that date.
QUESTION:
MR. SACHSE:
QUESTION:
MR. SACHSE:

When —

I am not sure I follow you.
On March 6, 1967, he

begins —

Yes.
his military service and he is paid

8
56 hours of vacation benefit.
Now, let me just proceed and I think you will
follow me.
He then is in the Navy for about a year and a half
or almost two years.

When he returns, he gets no vacation

benefit, no vacation at all during that first 13-week period
and he gets no vacation during the entire next year under
this contract's full work year.
The result from that — first, I want to put it in
a sort of simplified way, but I think this is what the Act
is really about.

Prom his standpoint, because he went into

the Service, he is having to go through the whole business
of being a rookie again, of having a

year and a half before

he works up to getting a vacation again.
QUESTION:

Well, he doesn’t even get the benefit of

a rookie because —
MR. SACHSE:
QUESTION:
MR. SACHSE:

That’s right, less.
— the rookie got the pro rata, 20 hours.
That’s right.

He didn't even get

the pro rata that a rookie would get.
QUESTION:
MR. SACHSE:

Right.
Now, the company said that this is

just a straight application of the contract because in these
13 weeks when he came back, he hadn’t served 25 weeks in the

prior year.

Then in the full year when he comes back, he

9
hadn’t served 25 weeks at the plant In that year and so this
is the way the contract works.
Now, our position is really, to just get to the
heart of it right at the beginning — our position is that
where a company bases its vacation benefits on a work
requirement such as 25 weeks in a year, which is just hali
of the year’s work, that what they are really doing, the
way the employees see it and the real effect of what they
are doing, is saying that a person who is a steady employee
of the company, who is there working every year, gets a
vacation every year, after he has gone through his initial
period and that under this Court’s decisions on the Selective
Service Act and under the language of the Act, this is part
of seniority and status, of longevity in the company.
And when he comes back, he shouldn’t be required
to sit there and reearn his right to a vacation.

He should

start getting vacations the year he comes back to work for
the company and certainly I can see problems in the first
year where you can play around with the did-he-work-justthree-weeks that year?

Did he work almost the whole year?

But here, even in the second year he received
no vacation benefits.
QUESTION:
MR. SACHSE:

Is the maximum vacation 56 hours?
No, it goes up, depending on how many

years he has been in employment.

10

QUESTION:

I see.

MR. SACHSE:

And the company does not dispute that

the way of figuring the maximum vacation is continuous and
he would get credit for his years in the Service for that.
They are just arguing about the -QUESTION:

About the maximum or the length of

vacation.
MR. SACHSE:

— qualification for it, 25 weeks’

qualification.
QUESTION:

Your argument is one of essentially of

linking vacation rights to seniority.
MR. SACHSE:
QUESTION:
MR. SACHSE:

That is correct.
On his return.
Our argument makes a distinction in

vacations and I think it has an advantage to it in that I
think it can get the lower courts out of the kind of mess
that they have been in, in trying to wokr out every detail
of every contract.
Our argument is this and we think that it is what
the Act calls for and what the decisions of this Court call
for — that where a company makes close correlation between
hours worked and vacation pay so that for every 24 hours
work you get three hours towards a

vacation, something like

that, then all the employees know it and they know they are
not getting rewarded for being the continual employee but

11
just each hour they got this little amount of extra pay.
QUESTION:
MR. SACHSE:
tion.

And that is compensation, really.
And

It is not seniority.

in that, we say it is compensa­
It is compensation.

But when there is not that kind of one-to-one
ratio, when the real question is whether a man has been a
steady employee and if he is, if he has put in, say 25 weeks
where the average person probably put in 50, here he gets
the same vacation, whether it is 25 weeks, 30 weeks, 35
weeks and so forth.
Then in that situation, what you are really looking
at Is seniority in the plant and a man should not lose his
vacation because he has been in military service in that
situation.
QUESTION:

Does the record show, Mr. Sachse, what

the typical number of weeks put in for a year was by a
worker with, say, five years’ seniority?

Was it the kind

of thing where you could expect to work 49 or 50 weeks of
the year or was 25 or 30 more likely?
MR. SACHSE:

I —there is data in the record on —

on work sheets of particular employees junior to him.; 47
weeks, the week — the year that he was there
believe is typical.

beforehand, I

It was stipulated that he would have

worked more than 25 weeks in each of the years that he was
in the military service and that people junior to him had

12
worked, more than 25 weeks in each of those years.
But there is sufficient data in the record to
show — it is also stipulated that he was not a temporary or
part-time employee and there is sufficient data in the
record to show that this was a steady job and he still works
there.
QUESTION:

What sort of leave did Petitioner

receive while he was in the Service?
MR. SACHSE:
record.

I don't know.

It is not in the

I think we can all assume he received whatever it

is that the military gives during that time.
QUESTION:

You don't recall —

MR. SACHSE:

It is our position that — that it

would be a can of worms to get into that because you then
have to start dealing with employee's who have been In
combat and what do you — how you count the leave that a
person gets when he is in Viet
QUESTION:

Nam or something like that.

Well, there is such a thing as terminal

leave in the military.

At least, there used to be, I think

at the rate of two and a half days a month.

Is that still

true?
MR. SACHSE:

I just don’t know.

get some leave in the military.

I assume he did

We certainly don't argue

that he received no leave In the military.
And we don't ask that he be paid — yes —

13
QUESTION:
Mr. Sachse.

Let me interrupt

just a minute,

I would assume that by the Government’s own

theory, it might make a difference whether the typical
number of weeks worked was, say, 30 and or 50, that if the
most a man could expect to work during the year was 30, 32
weeks and the company required 25, then it might be more
analagous to kind of an earned credit type of thing.
MR. SACHSE:
QUESTION:
MR. SACHSE:

Well —
Yes.
As I understand the point that you

are making, that is not the Government’s theory for this
reason, that in the Accardi case, this Court pointed out
that in a scheme for severance pay that was based on years
of service — and a year of service was so many months of
service and month of service was a month in which there
were so many days of service, that it could work out where
a person

had only had 10 or 12 days of service and it would

still be counted as a year of service.
Nov/, the Court rejected arguments in that case
that that was a very untypical sort of thing that a man
would be fired if he ivas working that little and the Court
concentrated on the proposition that — that the scheme
itself shows that there is not a one-to-one — not a close
ratio at all between the amount of vacation and the hours
worked.

14
Now, I think the facts of this case — and there
are work sheets in the Appendix that will show this — will
show that the 25 weeks was nowhere a typical work year, that
the 47 weeks or 50 weeks was much closer to it but we don't
suggest that the Court should get into that in every case.
One of the problems in this kind of case is that
the total amount of money that you are talking about is
usually small in any individual case and that the companies
need some fairly certain way of determining whether a
vacation benefit is owed or not and so do the employees and
it is better to seek a solution that can be easily applied.
QUESTION:
moment, let me see.

Mr. Sachse, while you are pausing for a
Perhaps this is oversimplification.

Are you trying to tack the 82 weeks of military
service onto the bar of the grey-marked bar that preceded it?
Or are you just trying to tack your two grey-marked bars
together for purposes of vacation?
MR. SACHSE:

Let me put it a different way.

is the way I understand it.

This

What I am trying to do is say

that when the man returns that In that year he can count his
military service for vacation entitlement, so that —
QUESiION:

Even though he got a vacation from the

Army.
MR. SACHSE:
Army.

Even though he got a vacation from the

The military service is a separate thing.

The purpose

15
of the Act Is to, number one, encourage people to go Into
the military and number two, to prevent people who go into
the military from being hurt when they come back and —
QUESTION;

Well, if that is the theory, then he

ought to be able to get the differential in pay, too, if
that is your basic theory.
MR. SACHSE;

Mo, we — no, our theory is that —

that you can ignore what happened in the military, that the
question is, when this man came back, when you start
figuring his first vacation after he is back, you have the
right to count his time in the military just as if it had
been time at work.
QUESTION:
MR. SACHSE:
QUESTION:

He'd be entitled to the first month off.
Sir?
Would he be entitled to the first

month off for a vacation?
MR. SACHSE:
QUESTION:
MR. SACHSE:
QUESTION:
MR. SACHSE:

Well —
You have got to get out of that one.
There is a problem in this —
Right.
— that bothers me and that is, when

a man comes back with only a week or two towards the end
of the year — and we have debated a bit about how this
should be solved, should you do a pro rata in that year and
then let it be the first full year?

16
The thing that shouldn't be allowed to happen is,
he has been in the military, he has come back, he has started
the year January 1st with everybody else, he shouldn't have
to work through that whole year and not get a vacation.
Okay.
QUESTION:

Well, then, going back to my question,

your ansvjer to my question, I should think,

very simply

would be, yes, you are trying to tack the number of days of
military service onto the number of days of employment that
preceded his military service.
MR. SACHSE:
that

I think that is correct.

I think

a fair answer to that question is, yes.
QUESTION:

So he should have vacation for both

1967 and 1968?
MR. SACHSE:

He would get — I prefer to speak

of the year in which he gets it because there is some con­
fusion there.

He would get a vacation benefit in the year

1968.
QUESTION:

That’s right.

Of how much?

Pie would have had, In

1967, a vacation of how long, a week?
MR. SACHSE:

MR. SACHSE:
QUESTION:

What if he

Two weeks?

Seven days, I believe it is.
Seven days.
Yes.
And in 1968, he would get —

17
MR. SACHSE:

He would get a seven-day vacation in

that year.
QUESTION:

All right.

So are you suggesting that

he get 14-days’ vacation in the remaining 13 weeks of
1968 or ?
MR. SACHSE:

No.

No, no, I am only saying that

in the year he comes back —
QUESTION:
1969?

1968?
MR. SACHSE:

'68.

Well, isn’t that the year he came back,

He came back in 1968, October 7th,

He came back October 7th, 1968.
QUESTION:

does he get?

All right.

Nov/, how much vacation

The vacation he didn’t have in 1967 as well

as the vacation he didn’t have in 1968?
MR. SACHSE:

No, no, we would only give him the

same vacation that he would have gotten in 1968 —
QUESTION:
MR. SACHSE:
QUESTION:
MR. SACHSE:

All right —
— if he had been working steadily.
— and we forget 1967 entirely.
We forget 19 — 1967 he got taken

QUESTION:
MR. SACHSE:

He got terminal leave, didn’t he?
That’s right.

when he went in.
QUESTION:

Oh, I see.

He was taken care of

MR. SACHSE:
QUESTION:
MR. SACHSE:

Yes.
I see.
Now, we have an alternative position

which is —
QUESTION:

What do you mean "we"?

I take it you

are talking about Congress, aren’t you?
MR. SACHSE:

Well, when I said "we," what I mean

is — I really have to mean two things.

One is that the

Department of Justice represents the individual, Earl Poster,
who is out there right now.

And we argue the case for him.

When I say "we," we also mean the Department of
Labor and the Justice Department support the position that
we have taken in this brief.
%

I haven't gotten to talk much about the cases but
there are two cases that it seems to me are controlling —
the language of the statute and two cases.
The language of the statute is that the veteran
should be restored in such manner as to give him such status
in his employment as he would have enjoyed if he had
continued in such employment continuously from the time of
his entering the Armed Forces until the time for his
restoration to such employment.
That was an Act in 19^8 really codifying this
Court’s decision or perhaps codifying and expanding this
Court's decision in the case called Flshgold.

19
But the Court has had two cases on questions
similar to this.

The big issue for awhile prior to the

Accardi case, among people who dealt with this problem, was
whether

vacation benefits, severance pay, pensions, counted

as questions of seniority status or whether they, on the
other hand, counted as insurance or other benefits, which
would be governed by the contract provisions for people on
leave of absence.
In Accardi, the Court for — the Court defined
the insurance or other benefits clause and it said that
that was something in addition to the seniority clause,
that it didn't keep severance pay from being seniority and
that it applied to benefits that the serviceman might get
while he is in the service.
In other words, that if an employee on leave of
absence could still go to the railroad hospital or his wife
could go to the railroad hospital, the insurance and other
benefits clause would assure that his wife could still go
there even if he was in the service.
And the Court very specifically ruled on or
discussed that insurance and other benefits clause.
Then, prior to the Accardi decision, the Magma
Copper case, you had this situation — employees who had
been denied both vacation pay and holiday pay.

The

vacation pay, they were denied it because they — although

20
they had satisfied their work requirement of 75 percent of
the available shifts, they were not present at' the plant on
the last day of the year because they were in the military.
As to holiday pays, when they would come back from
the military — just think about this for a minute -- but
they would come back from the military — these were in the
Viet Nam War — they were denied holiday pay for the 4th of
July and for Indipendence Day, though everyone else got it,
because they hadn’t satisfied a three-month requirement.
They had not been on the payroll three months when they came
back.
Nov/, the Ninth Circuit upheld that.
company could do that.

It said the

Then the Accardi case was decided and the Ninth
Circuit had the case back again on rehearing.

means.

This is not what "other benefits"

It is part of seniority.

See the Accardi case.

The veterans petitioned this Court and the Court
granted the writ

of certiorari and the Court summarily

reversed the Ninth Circuit
"Reversed.

with an opinion that just said,

See Accardi," with the citation.
There was a dissent in that case.

Justice Douglas wrote the dissent.

Justice Stewart

Justice Stewart and

Justice Harlan joined in the dissent.

And in the dissent,

21

they would have made a distinction between the amount ox
vacation or holiday pay that a person could get and the
entitlement to it and would have said that the question of
the entitlement to it is not a question of seniority.

It

is something that would have to be governed by the contract.
But that is the position that the Court did not
take and that is the"subversive opinion"— as you said in
an earlier case.
And as a result of that case, too, we think it is
even clearer that in this situation that the entitlement
should not be governed by the contract but should be a ques­
tion of seniority that the serviceman has a right to.
Nov;, I want to answer one question raised by
Respondents in their brief.

They say that as a matter of

sort of legal principle that a vacation — that vacation
pay is a part of — of wages paid, of salary and that,
therefore, it has to be something other than seniority,
that you can’t give a man a salary for the time that he
didn’t work and they cite a number of cases and arbitration
decisions.
But those cases make a different point, as we
read them.

That is, that — and the 1930's Court sometimes

said that vacation is just a gratuity and that the management
can do what it wants with it.
And in a number of cases, arbitrators and courts

22
held that vacations are not just questions of gratuity, that
they are things bargained for and in that sense, they say
that they are a function of wages but there certainly was no
attempt in those cases to answer the kinds of questions that
are set forth here and in —
QUESTION:

Those holdings are that it is a form of

deferred compensation, isn’t it?
MR. SACHSE:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
So it is related directly to the wages

he received at the time.
MR. SACHSE:

It is related to the wages.

It is the length of service — the

is an in-between sort of thing and the Court

has ruled on it in Magma Copper to say that it is a function
of seniority or — or I take that decision as ruling that
way, that it is protected by the Act.

23
There are — I want to give you another citation
which is United States versus Embassy Restaurant 359 US 29
which holds that payments into a union fund., though analy­
tically part of wages, are not considered part of wages but
Bankruptcy Act and it simply illustrates the point that you
have to look at the particular Act in the particular context
and there is no flat rule one way or the other, other than
what the statute says and the cases the Court has decided
ruling on.
Thank you.
QUESTION:

What is the Government’s position,

Mr. Sachse, in the case of a contract that calls for a oneday vacation for each month worked the preceding year?
MR. SACHSE:

Our position is that if it is clear

in the contract — one day vacation for each month’s work?
QUESTION:

Each month, each two weeks, whatever

you want to call it.
MR. SACHSE:

Well, if it is tied close enough to

precise amount of work done, we then say that it is a pure
function of wages and if the contract is clear, that the
returning veteran does not have a right to it and the
broadest example of that is a pooled vacation benefit where
money is actually set aside in a pool for vacation.
We don’t claim, with that kind of program, that
a person would have this right.

24
But what we are talking about is the veteran's
legitimate expectation when

he returns to work.

I don’t

think he would expect it in that kind of program but he
would here.
QUESTION:

Well,, isn’t it a legitimate expectation

that he will not lose the benefit of that period from the
time he began to work there until the time he went into the
Service?

If he gets his place in line, as of the date when

he left, why isn’t he restored fully under both the Act and
the contract?
MR. SACHSE:

Well, he is being made a new man

again, a rookie again.

He is having to go through a year

and a half again before he gets his vacation.

MR. SACHSE:

Well, that is no —

way but we don’t think that squares with the seniority and
status provisions of the Act and particularly with

this

Court’s prior cases on it.
This Court, in times, perhaps, when veterans were
given a little more deference than they have been from the
Viet Nam War, has interpreted this Act so as to really pro­

interpretations.

Mr. Shoop.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. SHOOP, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. SHOOP:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:

Initially let me set forth to the Court the
position of the Government, at least when they tried the
case in the District Court, for I was there.
The Government is seeking vacation for the year

1967 and 1968 under this chart that they have set forth.
They are seeking 64 hours of vacation in 1967 and
72 hours of vacation in 1968 for Mr. Foster and as I have set
forth in my brief —
QUESTION:

They are not still seeking that much,

are they?
MR. SHOOP:

sought that much.

The complaint in the initial case

I think they misunderstand vacation

benefits, as I have pointed out on page 4 of my brief.
Mr. Justice.
A person earns their vacation in one year and they
take it in their next year.

27
Mr. Poster earned his vacation in 1966.

He

received it in March of 1967 when he went into the military
service.
He earned his vacation in 1969 and on January 1st
of 1970 he is entitled to every cent of vacation that he
would have earned in that last year.
QUESTION:
what?

That is *69 vacation.

By "last year," you mean precisely

What period?
You just used the phrase "last year."
MR. SHOOP:

Okay.

Bet ween the year of 1966 —»

between January 1st of 1966 and December 31st of 1966,
Mr, Poster earned one week’s vacation, 56 hours.
On January 1st of 1968, he was entitled to leave
the employ of Dravo and do whatever was necessary and he
would have gotten that vacation.
He could have gone on vacation that week — as a
lot of people do in the first week of January — or he
could have waited later on in the year.
Now, in the year 1969, when he returned from the
military service, he worked that year and he earned his
vacation, which he Is entitled to in full on January 1st,
1970.
He again can take the pay and leave the employment
of Dravo or he can take his vacation or he can take it some­
time later on.

And, provided furing that year of 1969 and

28
provided during that year of 1966, he worked 26 work weeks.
I mean, 25 work weeks., excuse me.
He has to earn — have an earnings in those years
before he can get the vacation the next year.
You earn it in »67, take it in ’68; earn it in ’69
and take it in '70.
QUESTION:

Of course, one thing the Government

contends, as I understand it, is that this is less like an
earned vacation than it might be, since the man who works
25 weeks and the man who itforks 50 weeks get exactly the same
amount of vacation.
MR. SHOOP:
QUESTION:
MR. SHOOP:

No.
That is not right?
That is not correct.

works 25 weeks and the man who works 50
entitled to a vacation.

The man who

weeks are both

That is the difference.

The man who vforks — has worked for Dravo for 20
years is entitled to five weeks’ vacation under this contract
in issue.

The man who has worked for Dravo for five years is

entitled to a different length of vacation,.
QUESTION:

Okay, but how about two guys who each

work for Dravo five years, one who works 25 weeks and one
who works 50

weeks?

MR. uifOOP.
the next year.

They

both

would get the same vacation

29
Now, Dravo, however, expects every employee to
work regularly during the

course of the year.

We expect

everybody to normally attend his work who is on the payroll
50, 49 weeks.

This provision is negotiated into a collective

bargaining agreement by the union to protect people who for
some reason may be ill during the course of the year.
They say, gee, look, here is a guy who has been
ill for a month.

Why shouldn't he get a vacation?

Here is a man who may have left for a couple of
months for a leave of absence because his wife is ill.

Why

shouldn't he get a vacation in the next year?
So therefore, the union comes to the company and
says, let's make a man earn his vacation if he works 25
weeks.
The company expects anybody who is regularly on
the payroll — except for leaves of absence, except for
illness — to work 50 weeks, 49

weeks, what we all work

during the course of the year and not examples like they try
and bring out in these cases of the man could only work 25
hours or something like that.

HeTd be fired

for failure to

be a regular employee.
QUESTION:

Well, then, Mr. Shoop, in your client's

business, it is not seasonal, is it?
MR. SHOOP:

No, sir.

QUESTION:

It is not.

No.

30
MR. SHOOP:

Dravo is a shipbuilding corporation in

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and business is pretty good right
now.
QUESTION:
MR. SHOOP:
QUESTION:
MR. SHOOP:

And it is not a seasonal business.
No, sir.
Good or bad.
No.

Now, to answer some other questions that were
raised in part of my argument, the question here is more than
the $377.92 involved, which are the vacation entitlements in
1967 and the vacation entitlements in 1968 which, by the way,
your Honors, in 1967, he became entitled to another day’s
vacation.

He would — his vacation entitlement in ?67 is

64 hours.

His vacation entitlement in '68 is 72 hours.
We recognized that when he got his vacation in

1970 and we gave him credit for his military service as far
as the length of his vacation goes.
That is not at issue here.
And we did recognize that.

We are talking about the

entitlement to a vacation.
Now, let me point out the economic significance of
finding the benefit as the Government would argue here.
We are dealing with a statute that has no statute
of limitations.

We are dealing with a statute that its only

detriment to filing suit is the doctrine of Lasches.

31
At least In Pennsylvania and as recognized by the
Third Circuit, Lasches doesn’t come into effect until a man
has a known right.
This statute has not been significantly amended
since its enactment in 19^0, so theoretically, if you find
for the Government, every employee at Dravo who has been in
the military service can file suit to recover back vacation

pay.
QUESTION:

Whether he had returned or not

returned?
MR. SHOOP:

Well, if he returned.

He would have

to return.
Moreover
QUESTION:
MR. SNOOP:
QUESTION:
MR. SHOOP:

And he has to return within a certain —
90 days.

He has to return —

Within 90 days.
-- within 90 days after his discharge

from the Selective Service to be entitled to any reimployment
benefits.
QUESTION:

Right.

And if there is a — if he has

been in the military longer than a certain number of years,
it is not applicable at all.
MR. SHOOP:

Is that right?

Yes, let me point that out.

That was

my next question.
And the Act does, because of public policy to

32
encourage enlistments in the military service, also protect
people who are enlisting.

Therefore, your question as to

whether this is moot, although I would contend it isn’t any­
way, because of the Lasches argument, it — people who do
enlist are protected.
They are protected, Mr. Justice Stei'/art, for a
p eriod of four years.
QUESTION:
MR. SHOOP:

That is, if they have —
If they enlist in the military service,

they can stay in the military service for four years —QUESTION:
MR. SHOOP:

For up to four years.
-- a fifth year, if they are requested

by the Government to stay an extra year and this came up
during the Cuban missile crisis, is when they asked some
people to stay in the service and they amended the statute
at that time to increase it to five years upon request of
the service.
Now, let me give you an example of, under the
Government's theory, what can happen.
An employee from Dravo can enlist in the military
service on January 1st of 1975.

He can continue in the

military service —
QUESTION:

What is the enlistment hitch now under

the Volunteer Army, three years or what?
MR. SHOOP:

I think it is still three years.

It

33
was the last time I heard.
But he can continue in the military service until
December — in the middle of December, 1979.

He can then,

in 90 days — sometime in March of 1975 — come back to
work for Dravo.
According to the Government, we could owe him
anywhere between 8 and 20 weeks’ vacation pay the day he
came back to work for us because he has met the requirements
of the reemployment statute.
I submit, your Honors, the next day he could quit
and go to work for somebody else and there is nothing we
could do about it.
Moreover, you take their argument one other point.
The lower courts, accepting a decision like this, could say,
hospitalization benefits, life insurance, how about vacation
bonuses?

Many companies pay bonus for vacation and taken

at various times of the year.
Is he entitled to this?
According to the Government’s theory, I think you
can go as far as holding that it would include wages, that
for some reason may be argued to appear a prerequisite of
seniority.
QUESTION:

Now, when you speak of the vacation

bonus, you mean that the practice of giving one day and a
half for each day you take it between January 1st and

34
March 1st or something like that.
MR. S1I00P:

My familiarity is, we give them $30.

Many companies give them $50 to take a vacation between
January 15th and March 1st, $40 to take a

vacation in the

next two months and nothing to take it during the summer and
then going back up in the fall.

Steel and aluminum all have

these type of bonus arrangements.
QUESTION:

Going back to your hypothetical case,

is it your position that the Government theory would require
you to take a man who worked for 30 days for Dravo and then
went into the Service for four years and then came back and
he might have built up this — by tacking the military on to
the 30 days, initial days —
MR. SNOOP:
QUESTION:

This much vacation.
— he might have a months vacation

coming.
MR. SHOOP:

If the position he held in the 30 days

was other than temporary and it is no holding that a pro­
bationary employee is other than temporary.

That was

decided by the Fourth Circuit in Allen versus V/erten Steel,
I believe, in — quite a number of years ago.
So probationary employee and other than temporary
are not synonymous.

However, if he was a summer employee

who came to work for Dravo for the summer and wasn' t goinp; to
come back in the fan#

He entered the military.

He was

35
known as a temporary employee under the terms of the Act.
QUESTION:

Mr. Shoop, are you suggesting when you

mention insurance benefits that if a veteran were to die in
service, he would be entitled to participate in the company's
group insurance program?
MR. SHOOP:

He certainly wouldn’t under any of the

plans that I am familiar with.
QUESTION:

But a logical extension of the Govern­

ment’s argument in this case would appear to me to hold that
that is a possibility.
You

know, there is no earned -- you know, my

understanding of vacation benefits and my understanding of
all these other benefits are that they are earned benefits.
They are benefits that you earn by working for Dravo.
I think this Court has amply pointed out that the
vacation benefits between the time he left Dravo and between
the time he came back were paid for by the Government at —
the snide remark of Counsel’s— significantly higher rate of
two and a half days for — per every month of service, he
gets 30 days vacation a year where he only gets seven at
Dravo.
QUESTION:

Since he got no vacation from anyone in

the year 1969*
MR. SHOOP:

In the year 19693 he got no vacation

time off, but he earned vacation that wras taken effective

36
January 1st of 1970

— or could have been taken at that

time.
QUESTION:

Which is like saying he earned a

vacation sometime in 1970 but he didn’t get anything in ’69.
MR. SHOOP:

He did not get any time off or he did

not get any pay, but he earned a vacation that he takes in
1970 and I think you will find that that is the way vacations
are.

You work for a period of time and then you get a

vacation.
QUESTION:

Well, sure, you always figure you are

going to put in some rookie time or whatever you want to
call it before you are qualified but the Government’s
argument as I understand it Is that he shouldn’t have to put
it in when he first comes to work and then when he first
comes back from the service, too.
MR. SHOOP:

No, sir, your Honor.

you have to put in time every year to get a

I submit that
vacation.

Under

your theory, you could take a year off and you wouldn’t —
you would get vacation.
QUESTION:

That isn't true.

Well, he put in a year from the year

January 1st, '68 to January 1st, '69; he put in, presumably,
39 weeks worth of military and 13 weeks with Dravo.

But he

got no vacation the following year.
MR. SHOOP:

That is right.

Now, as I stated before, this Act was enacted in

37
1940 and except to codify what was the escalator principle
in Fishgold versus Sullivan Drydock, the Act has not sig­
nificantly been amended.
QUESTION:

Let me back up to your statement about

the 13 weeks at the end of '69.

Do I understand you to say

that in the first week — that on the first day of January
he was then entitled to vacation benefits deriving from the
13 weeks plus his prior
MR. SHOOP:

service?

No, sir.

To qualify for a vacation in any one year, a
regular employee must perform work for Dravo Corporation a
period of 25 weeks.
QUESTION:

Well, then, x*hen and at what point in

1970 would he get the benefit of the 13 weeks which he
worked in 1969?
MR. SHOOP:

He would never get the benefit of

working those 13 weeks except for the

fact that in length

of vacation it will be recognized that the entire year of
'63 would be — and I believe those 13 weeks were worked in
'68, your Honor — that is, betx^een '68 and '69.
QUESTION:

Didn't the Third Circuit say that that

should be remanded to the District Court?
MR. SHOOP:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
That particular portion that the Chief

Justice inquired about?

38
HR. SHOOP:

The Government has, at this time, in

their brief,that wasn't reached in argument, made a — an
argument for pro rata benefits.

They say, well, at least he

is entitled to 13/25fchs of a vacation.
raised at the trial level.

That issue was never

As I submit in my brief, if your

Honor would look on page 24 of my brief and in the Appendix
on page 10, what happened was, the judge at the trial level
tried to effect a settlement between Dravo and the Government
and he suggested this as being an issue "maybe we could pro­
rate the vacation for 1968."
I specifically stated to him on the record at that
time that that was not the issue before this court and he
recognized it.
That was not the issue before the District Court
at that time and the judge said, "Yes, I recognize it."
But being a non-jury trial, he was trying to settle it and
may have said a number of things in the record.

I don't

think either one of us believed vie were going to be here, or
I was going to be here today when we tried this case. But —
QUESTION:

Well, if we affirm the judgment of the

Third Circuit, the case would go back to the District Court
and the employee would have a right to litigate, at least as
a matter of contract law whether he xtfas entitled to a pro­
rated vacation.
MR. SHOOP:

Right.

The issue before the District

39
Court would be, one, was the matter raised and litigated
there and, two, what Is the outcome or what decision would
this Court make based on the lav/ and the contract in issue?
If you affirm -- that is exactly what the Third
Circuit did.

They sent it back to the District Court.

QUESTION:

Mr. Shoop, you say that although the

Act doesn’t require you to recognize that he is entitled to
a vacation, you

say that if he works all of 1969, then in

'70 he is entitled to a vacation and you say you will — the
length of the vacation pay that he is entitled to, you say
will include the time he was in the military?
MR. SHOOP:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Now, do you say the Act requires that?

MR. SHOOP:
QUESTION:

I would think so, sir.

I —

Because you must treat him as having

been on the payroll?
MR. SHOOP:
as seniority.

Because — no, because you treat him

He is, in his relationship to other employees,

has five years seniority.

You look at your contract and you

find that people with five years’ seniority are entitled to
X-number of v/eeks' vacation.
QUESTION:

No, but that is only if you have worked

those — that is only if you have been entitled to vacation
during those

periods.

MR. SHOOP:

Not necessarily.

I would — that issue

40
wasn’t raised and I wholeheartedly agree wloh che company s
actions in this case of giving the man his benefie in ^ne
military service towards the length of his vacation.
QUESTION:

Mr. Shoop, what happens with an employee

who does not go in the military service but who in 1967, for
whatever reason, worked only 20 weeks, in. 1968 worked only
15 weeks but then he comes to 1969, he \tforks 52 weeks — how
do you compute his vacation for —
MR. SHOOP:
QUESTION:
MR. SHOOP:

Okay.
— earned for 1970?
Okay.

He would receive no vacation

benefits for the year 1967, that which he worked less than
25 work weeks.
QUESTION:
MR. SHOOP:

All right.
He would receive no vacation benefits

for the year 1968, that which he worked less than 25 work
weeks.

He would receive vacation benefits in 1969 when he

worked more than 25 work weeks which would be taken in 1970
and the length of his vacation, I think is the question you
are getting to —

MR. SHOOP:

That is right.

entitled to one day.

But he is only

In this period of time, Mr. Poster

in this case was entitled to over two weeks' vacation when
he I’eturned.

That is why you wouldn't return as a rookie.

You'd want to return as a veteran so you can get that length
of vacation better than you had before.
QUESTION:

In other words, the total length of

his service from his first employment date down to 19 — the
beginning of 1970 is used to measure the amount of vacation
but not to give him any dollars for the period he was in the
military service.
MR. SHOOP:

No, sir.

You earn your vacation each

and every year.
QUESTION:

Well, your answer to my question is yes,

then, isn't it?
MR. SHOOP:

Yes.

43
QUESTION:

I wonder, Mr. Shoop — you said this

was within the statute, this is related to seniority.

Yet

Section 2 says, "Should be so restored in such manner as to
give him such status in his employment as he would have
enjoyed if he had continued in employment continuously from
the time of his entering the Armed Forces to the time of his
restoration in such employment.
Now, the hypothetical I gave you before of the
chap who had not gone into service but only 20 weeks or 15
weeks, I gather you are giving him the same status in his
employment on restoration as that fellow.
MR. SHOOP:
QUESTION:

As that fellow did.

Yes, sir.

Because, at least for purposes of the

length of vacation he gets in 1970 that he earned in 1969,
he is given credit for his time in service.
MR. SHOOP:

Yes, sir.

vacation is no problem.

Right.

The length of

We are giving him all the credit.

And to point out further that a vacation Is an
earned benefit under the Dravo contract, I would point out
that in Article Roman numeral IV Section 3, as cited at my
brief, a person at Dravo, who worked considerably more over­
time — that is to say, regularly six days a week — receives
more vacation than the person who doesn’t work those hours.
So there is a relationship between the amount of
time worked and the amount of vacation you get in that you

get more vacation if you work longer hours and more overtime.
The two cases that were cited by the Government and
relied on I think ought to be examined in some detail and
the first was Accard!.
What happened in the Accardi decision was the
Pennsylvania Railroad attempted to abolish the position of
fireman on new diesel tugs back in 1959.

A strike ensued.

The firemen went on strike.
The entire strike was finally settled in i960 with
an agreement that the position of fireman was abolished.
However, they would remain on the payroll, those firemen who
had 20 years or more seniority, and they remained on the
work force.
The other part of the agreement paid severance pay
to those employees who

had less than 20 year's seniority.

The severance pay was paid on a theory of the
number of years of compensated service you had with the
Pennsylvania Railroad.

The Pennsylvania Railroad, being wrong

again, argued that this was an earned benefit.
This Court correctly saw it wasn't.

It couldn't be

an earned benefit because the people who weren’t severed
would never, ever get the benefits.

And everybody who was

discharged got some benefit.
The only thing they were arguing about was the
amount of the benefit and that is exactly like our vacation

i

il5

The amount is not in question.

It is a perquisite of

seniority and the entire agreement was the severance pay.
There was no full collective bargaining agreement.
And the Third Circuit in this case reviewed the
entire contract and came to the conclusion that vacations
at Dravo are an earned benefit.
Eagar versus Magma Copper has also been referred
to — it was a per curiam decision.

There was a dissent in

that case written by Justice Douglas on behalf of you,
Justice Stewart and the late Justice Harland.

In that case,

though, Eagar had worked the amount of time that was
necessary to receive the benefit.
He had worked 75 percent of the hours in the week
before he

entered the military service — in the year before

he entered the military service.
The only thing was, he wasn’t on the payroll at
the end of his first anniversary year and wasn’t on the pay­
roll on December 31st of the vacation-earning year.
That is the only difference.

He earned his.

Here

it has not been earned.
QUESTION:

Well, but he didn't — he didn’t meet

the conditions of the collective bargaining agreement.

MR. SHOOP:
QUESTION:

MR. SHOOP:

But he met all the —
There is no question of that.
— Army’s requirements of the collective

H6
bargaining agreement.

You take my position that vacations

are an earned benefit, that they are a payment for earnings,
deferred compensation for working at the company.
Eagar is entitled to it and anybody else at Dravo
is entitled to it, provided they have earned their vacation.
QUESTION:

Well, you don't have the same agreement

that was involved in the Eagar case.
MR. SI-IOOP:
agreement.

No, but I have got the similar type

In my case you have to work 25 work weeks.

In

his you had to work 75 percent of the work weeks.
QUESTION:

Plus be on the payroll at the end of

the year.
MR. SNOOP:

I would say — my position on those, if

we had those in these collective bargaining agreements, that
those are seniority provisions.
QUESTION:

Well, that is an easy position for you

to take now.
MR. SNOOP:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Since you don't have that in your

agreement.
MR. SHOOP:

Yes, sir.

My law school professor, however, told me that a
dissent of three justices in the Supreme Court is better
than nothing at all and so, therefore, I would ask for your
consideration of your dissent in that opinion which goes

47
further5 by the way, than I intend to ask this Court — than
I have asked this Court to go today.
As X stated before, Dravo expects

expects every

employer — every employee to perform the work of 50 weeks.
The judges and justices who, in their judicial
opinions, have thoroughly considered the issue of

vacation

entitlement have all determined that vacation entitlement does
not automatically accrue as a result of seniority but are
earned benefits as found by this Court.
As far back as 1948, Judge Learned Hand, in
Dwyer v. Crosby, cited in my brief, held this.
Judge Hofstedder, in Austin versus Sears and
Roebuck in 1974 held this.
Judge Hill in Kasmeier in the

Tenth Circuit held

this.
Judge Adams in the Third Circuit held this.
[?]
Judge Batten, dissenting, in Locaynia in the
Ninth Circuit held this.
These gentlemen have all reviewed thoroughly the
collective bargaining agreements in issue, the facts

of

both Accard! and Eagar and found, as well as Justice Douglas,
Justice Stewart and Justice Harlan, that vacation benefits
are an earned benefit, that you must meet that earnings
requirement — in this case of 25 weeks — to be entitled
in that year or the next year to a vacation.
