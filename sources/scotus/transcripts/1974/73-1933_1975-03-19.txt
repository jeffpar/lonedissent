MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We’ll hear arguments

next in 73-1933., United States against Citizens and Southern
National Bank»
Mr. Friedman,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ,,
ON 3EIIALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR, FRIEDMAN;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court;
The appellee, the Citizens and Southern National Bank
is the largest bar,king organization in the city of Atlanta,
Georgia.
There are six banks located in the suburbs of Georgia
in each of which C&S, as I shall refer to it, has a five
percent stock interest.

Each of these banks is an independent

corporation, with its own offices and its own board of
directors.

But virtually since the organization of -these

banks, C&S has treated them and operated them as though they
were ds facto branches of C&S.
This is an appeal from a judgment of the United
States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia,
which, after trial, dismissed a government civil antitrust
suit challenging the relationship between these five-percent
banks and C&S,
The questions presented are;

4
First, whether the arrangements between C&S and the
banks, which virtually eliminated all competition between them,
constitutes an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of
section 1 cf the Sherman Act.
The second question is whether, as the district
court, held, the questions respecting the legality of the
relationship between C&S and the five-percent banks is a matter
committed to the exclusive primary jurisdiction of the Federal
Reserve Board of Governors.
The third question is; whether the acquisition by C&S
of these five-percent banks, thus making permanent this existing
relationship which depended largely on the inter-adjustments
between them and the five-percent stock interest, whether that
acquisition of the complete interest in the five-percent banks
violated section 7 of the Clayton Act.
Now, with respect to the Clayton Act issue, it in­
volves only five rather than six of the five-percent banks,
because with respect to the sixth bank, the Bank of Tucker,
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which has juris­
diction over these mergers, rejected that merger,,

So the Bank

of Tucker is involved only in the Sherman Act aspect of the
case, not in the Clayton Act: aspect»
QUESTION;

Does the FDIC state reasons, Mr. Friedman,

for rejecting as to the sixth bank?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

Yes,

What it said was that with

5
respect to the Bank of Tucker, which Was founded in 1919?
there they said the initial acquisition by C&S in the 1960's
of an interest and the development of -this relationship was
itself anticompetitive? because prior to that time Tucker
and C&S had been fully independent and competitors? whereas
it distinguished the other five situations? and there it said
there was no competition between them from the outset.
Now, at the end of the 1950‘s and in the 1960's?
Georgia law had two limitations upon it which affected the
ability of C&S to expand into the suburbs of Atlanta..
First, it prohibited C&S from opening branches beyond
the city of Atlanta; and? secondly? it prohibited a bank from
acquiring more than five percent of the stock in another bank.
In this period the Atlanta suburbs? like the suburbs
of many metropolitan areas? were expanding rapidly and C&S
devised a method by which it hoped to avoid the State law
limitations on branching.
What it did was to assist in the organization of
these suburban banks; acquired a five percent interest in
eachof these banks, which was the maximum permitted under
State law? and then played a role in the operation of these
banks? in supervising them and advising them and managing
them? that made them virtually a branch of C&S.
QUESTION: Does the government here have the burden
of showing that the situation would be different after the

6

acquisition than it was under the five-percent arrangement?
MR. FRIEDMANs

Well, I would ■— may I answer the

question this way, Mr. Chief Justice:

Our position is that

the acquisition is bade because, were it not for the five-percent
arrangement, the acquisition would violate the standards that
this Court has announced, and our position is that you cannot
rely on what we believe to be the illegal situation that led
to the initial elimination, of competition to justify "die
claim that the acquisition now does not substantially lessen
competition.
I add one other factor, which I adverted to earlier,
that the effect of the acquisition is to make permanent — to
make permanent a situation that hitherto has existed as a
result of relationships,

There are two instances, one

relating to C&S, another one relating to the Trust Company of
Georgia, in which banks in the situation of the five-percent
banks broke away

broke away and became independent banks.

Once, of course, C&S acquires these banks, that’s the
end of it.

They are part of the C&S system.

Thereafter, I

assume, they will be operated as branches in fact rather than
the de facto branches under which they are now.
So I think to that extent we do show that there is a
different situation, because it becomes permanent, it's
cemented together, there would be a different situation after
the acquisition than exists now.

7
But our other answer is, a more fundamental answer
is that they cannot justify, they cannot justify these
acquisitions by the claim that there is no lessening of
competition because there was no competition, where the
result of the lack of competition itself, we believe,
violated and flowed from a violation of section 1»
QUESTION;

Than what does the language "lessening

competition" mean?
MR, FRIEDMAN:

May be substantially to lessen

competition.
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. FRIEDMAN;

What we think, Mr, Justice, the

whole policy, -the whole policy of section 7 of the Clayton
Act, the purpose there of preserving competition, of awaiting
restraints and their insipiency, in order to avoid things
before they develop into full violations of the Sherman Act.
We think that policy would be subverted, would not
be effectuated if we would say that because they had previously
eliminated the competition, therefore they can now rely on
that as a justification -- and the words "substantially lessen
competition" we think we do com© within that standard,
because, as we discuss in our brief, looking at the
concentration figures in the Atlanta market, which this Court
has indicated are sufficient to establish a prima facie case
of violation, the affect of this acquisition would be significantly

8

to increase the already concentrated Atlanta bank market.
So we think within the literal terms of the statute,
we have established our burden.
The only question is whether it can be offered as a
defense, an answer to this increase in concentration, where
really the increase is insignificant here because as a result
of our prior violation —« as a result of our prior violation,
we have eliminated the very competition that section 7 is
intended to promote,
QUESTION;

Let me see if I understand what you're

saying there by puttig it into a. hypothetical case, Mr,
Friedman,
Are you suggesting that one of these five-percent
banks might conceivably be located in an area that experienced
a sudden growth and a great deal of business, and finally
concluded, its directors concluded that it could stand on its
own feet, independent of any relationship or guidance or
help from the "home office", and then they would regard
themselves as emancipated?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

It could —

Even though the Atlanta bank owned five

percent?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

It could well, and as I have

indicated -~
QUESTION:

Is that the kind of situation you're

9

talking about that you think the antitrust law must reach
this in its insipiency?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes, Mr. Justice — well, what I was

suggesting was something else, ?!r. Justice.

What I was

suggesting was that section 7 is intended to reach anti­
competitive acquisitions in order to prevent the development
of a situation where there would be the actual elimination of
competition as distinguished from the potential for eliminating
competition that section 1 is designed to reach.
That's what I was trying to suggest in speaking
about reaching them in their insipiency, but we have two
instances in this record:

one, a C&S bank? another a

different bank which did break away for various reasons.
And these banks are now independent and are now growing.
It may well be that if these markets develop, some of these
other banks would decide to break away from the control»
Now, let me just refer briefly to the kind of
control that C&S exercised here, both in the organization of
the banks and in their operations.
QUESTION:

Mr. Friedman, before you go into that —

you said a few moments ago that so far as the Sherman Act
was concerned, there was an initial violation in the
formation, as I understand it, of these five-percent banks.
MR, FRIEDMAN:

I'm sorry, Mr. Justice, perhaps I

misspoke myself. The violation was not in the formation of

10

these banks, the violation that we're challenging is the
operating relationships between C&S and the five-percent banks,
which stemmed from the way in which they organized them*, but
was developed as time went on when they assumed virtual control
over all the operations of the bank*.
It’s not just the organization.
the organization of the bank itself.

We’re not challenging

We don’t say when they

applied five percent this is violated section 1.

What we say

is the whole relationship, starting with the five-percent
acquisitions, than the other tiling they did in organising the
bank, and then the way that they operated with the bank*

It’s

that whole series of relationships, we say, violatas section 1,
because it amounts to an elimination of all competition, between
C&S and these independent banks*

That’s our theory? not just

the initial bank.
QUESTION: Right. Well, may I ask you a question on
the basis of that -theory:

If Georgia law had been different,

and these five branches had been organized as branches, would
that have been any violation of the Sherman Act?
HR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

No, no, of course not, Mr. Justice.

Well, what is the economic difference,

then?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, I think the difference, Mr.

Justice, the difference is that the thrust of Section 1 of the
Sherman Act is against restraints upon competition created by

11
independent entities which combine -- there are many tilings
that an individual firm can do, if it's a single entity, that
two independent firms can't do.
To give a simple example, if there are two — if the
firm has a western division and an eastern division, it can
obviously direct that the western division will sell in the
west and the eastern division will sell in the east.
QUESTION:

But

I understand that, but, historically I've

also understood that it was a policy of the antitrust
division to encourage banks to open branches which stimulate
competition.

So my question directed to you related to the

economic injury.

In other words, what interest is the

government protecting here that would not be involved or
implicated if Georgia law had been different, as indeed it
should have been perhaps, until now, to follow their
customers into the suburbs as they move to the suburbs?
What is the economic injury?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, I think, Mr. Justice, the

economic interest here i3 the whole basic concept that under
the Sherman Act you cannot use

make arrangements between

independent entities which eliminates competition.

It would

have been a very different case if Georgia law had permitted
it, and we would have no objection

we would have no

objection at all if these banks were merely sponsored and
assisted, if C&S had treated these banks the way it treats

12

many banks which it has sponsored, with whom it has corresponded
relationships, there would be no problem*
Our problem in this case is that while they purported
to be creating independent competing entities, independent
entities, that are supposed to operate independently, in fact
they weren't independent, and we think this Court's decisions
— we've cited some of them in our brief

have recognised

that once you use the vehicle of separate corporations, for
whatever reason -- for whatever reason — once you use the
vehicle of separate corporations, you've got to treat them as
separate entities.

You can't combine them together and say,

Well, they're separate entities for various purposes, but in
terms of seeing whether what these entities are doing with each
other, whether that's permissible under the Sherman Act, we
shall ignore the separate entities and treat them as a single
entity.
This Court, many years ago, in the Schenlev case, an
interstate commerce case, recognized the situation. There it
was

a situation, the question was whether a wholly owned sub­

sidiari'' of a distiller was engaging in private carriage, as it
held, as it contended, or in contract carriage as the Inter­
state Commerce Commission had held.
And the argument was: Well, ignore the separate
corporate entities.

It's true, maybe it seems to be contract

carriage, but we're doing it for our parent and therefore it

should be treated as private carriage.
no.

And this Court said

This Court said? Uhen you elect to operate as separate

corporations, you have to comply with the requirements that the
law imposes on separate corporations.
Now, -QUESTION:

Mr. Friedman, suppose

this is not

hypothetical but it involves a projection — suppose yon had
not taken an appeal here at all, and five years from now -the
fears which you have expressed, or the concerns about lessening
competition were demonstrable in the view of the Antitrust
Division, would you be in the position to move in at that time
and seek a divestiture?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
doubt it, Mr. Justice,

If wa hadn't appealed, I very much

I don't know.

I don't know of a case

like that that has happened, but if it was held that the
acquisitions were valid, I would think we would be hard-pressed
to turn around later on and say, Now you should hold that they
were invalid.
I mean, we might conceivably, if C&S reached the
point where it began to assume monopoly power in the Atlanta
markets, we might proceed against them under section 2, But
I find it very difficult to sea how we could, in effect,
re-litigate the issue of the validity of the acquisitions
under section 7 of the Clayton Act, once they had been
consummated.

14
I would say it would be coup arable, for example, Mr.
Justice, if — Mr. Chief Justice, I’m sorry —■ if we had
never brought this suit after the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation had permitted the merger? if we had never brought
the suit and, under the statute, if we don’t challenge it within
thirty days, the order becomes final.

I don’t suppose if,

five years later, things go much worse we could then turn around
and challenge these acquisitions.
I assume we would be bolds

You’re five years too

late.
And I would think the same thing would apply in this
situation.
Now, what C&S did in the organization of these banks
was about as follows s
First, they helped them obtain a charter.

That’s a

normal situation when they’re sponsoring a bank.
They helped them select a site.

That's a normal

situation.
They helped them sell stock.

That, perhaps, gets a

little more.
They, in effect, selected the directors.

This get

a little more serious.
And then, in each case, of each one of these fivepercent banks, they provide the chief operating officer.
Beginning in 1965, all of these five-percent banks

15
started using the C&S name.
QUESTION*

May I say, what you told us up to now

you do not contend is a violation of the antitrust lav;?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, of course not.

But I'm just

trying to give the background —
QUESTION:

You're giving us the history, but I just

wondered —
MR. FRIEDMAN:

just setting the background, in

the light of which, what they did -thereafter -QUESTION: Right»

But all of this sponsorship and

creation and everything that went with it, that you told us
■about so far, you do not submit is a violation of the Act.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, we don't — •may I make something

very clear, Mr. Justice, in light of what our opponents say,
we don't claim that any particular individual thing itself
is a violation; what we claim is that the whole relationship
under which all competition was eliminated —
QUESTION:

But all of these components, the whole

totality that you’ve told us about up to now, you would not
say was a violation.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
I

No, not

but the last thing that

the two last things that I come to are beginning to

develop and reach into.
QUESTION:

All right.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

One is the selection and the placing

16

as chief operating officers of the banks of officials of CSS.
Zind the record shows -that officials were shifted back and forth.
In every instance -die chief operating officer of the bank#
one of these five-percent banks# was a C&S official.

And in

several instances when C&S was displeased with the way the
officials were performing# they selected a nexv official»
QUESTION:

It would seem to me, if I may think out

loud, that your case would be

is stronger if you do not

rely on the sponsorship and creation of these banks, but
rather analogize them to banks that were independently spon­
sored —
(■

MR» FRIEDMAN:

Well, they purported — they purported

to be independently sponsored.
QUESTION: Right.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

But

but things began to develop.

Starting in .1965, each bank used the C6S name.
That is, instead of it being the First National Bank of Sandy
Springs, it was the C&S National Bank of Sandy Springs,
QUESTION:

You have some pictures here showing that,

MR, FRIEDMAN:

There’s some pictures showing that,

and they also used the logogram, which is this lollipop-like
thing, with the distinctive letters C&S",

So whan the

public passed by these banks, they see it to be C&S banks.
Now, one rather interesting tiling I've mentioned
previously is that the bank — the first bank that they

17

organized was something called the Bank of Stone Mountain,
and the Bank of Stone Mountain, which was the first on© in this
group, was the first one out.

Stone Mountain is no longer a

member of the C&S team.
And the — what happened was when they came around
to these various banks after Georgia law had been changed in
1970, permitting banks to expand beyond the city limits of
Atlanta, they wanted to merge with Stone Mountain, and Stone
Mountain didn't want to merge with them, and the result was
CSS sold its interest in the bank and Stone Mountain is now7
an independent functioning bank.
And it's rather revealing, I think, that the former
president of C&S, a man named Mills Lane, testified that they
had a very unhappy relationship with Stone Mountain.

He

said the board of directors of Stone Mountain v;as very
different from the boards of directors of the other fivepercent banks.
The reason was -QUESTION:

Didn't that

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Friedman.

~~ that the board of directrs of

Stone Mountain wanted -QUESTION:

Mr, Friedman.

MR. FRIEDMAN;

Yes?

QUESTION; Excuse me for interrupting you, but I
wonder whether Stone Mountain, as I recollect, is fairly

18
comparable.

Wasn't there a stockholder who owned, more than

fifty percent of that bank?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

I believe thirty percent.

Thirty percent?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I believe it was thirty percent,. Mr.

Justice.
QUESTION:

Of course, for SEC purposes, that's more

than abundant for control.
MR. F RIEDMANs
QUESTION:

Yes.

In any event, the stockholders of the other

five-percent banks, as I recall, were, for the most part,
employees, officers and directors and stockholders of CSS.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I'm not sure for the most part,

there was a substantial number.

There's figures in the record,

and it varies from bank to hank? but I don't believe — there
may have been one or two; I don't believe in most part that
even the employees, officers of C&S or C&S affiliates were
majority stockholders of any of these five-percent banks.
C&S general policy was not to go into a situation
unless -their five percent block was the largest.
But Stone Mountain, it's true -- Stone Mountain was
operated up to this point as one of these five-percent C&S
banks.

It had the name, C&S Bank of Stone Mountain»
QUESTION: Right.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

And the complaint was —* the complaint

19

that Mr- Mills had

was the board of directors of Stone

Mountain wanted to -tell him, the president of the bank, what to
do ard did so.

In other words, they disconnected, they dis­

affiliated with Stone Mountain because they couldn't control
Stone Mountain.
Stone Mountain was an independent bank and had the
effrontery to try to be an independent bank, and they didn't
like that.
How, the district court spelled out in its findings,
at pages 50a to 55a of the Appendix to our Jurisdictional
Statement, and while these findings are made in connection
with the Section 7 discussion of the district court, they
facts they set forth are equally applicable to the Section 1
issue, exactly what it is that C&S does in its relationship
between these banks.
As I indicated, the officials move around from bank
to bank, for purposes of the CSS pension and profit-sharing
plans, service with the C&S bank is considered the same as
service with one of the five-percent banks.
C&3 people review, after they have made certain
loans, made by the subsidiary banks, a C&S official sits on
the board of directors of every one of these banks as an
advisory director.

C&S has an organisation called the Branch

Supervisory Department, and it supervises these allegedly
independent banks.

Hot*/, the customers of the banks have

20

available at any on® of the five-percent branches all the
services rendered and made available to customers of CSS,
And particularly significant, the officers and officials of
the five-percent banks receive and rely upon the manuals ,
directives, instructions that C&S puts out.
And these include specific instructions and advice
with respect to their pricing practices»
Now, a number of these instructions show at the bottom
of the instruction that a copy goes to the president of 'the
five-percent bank, which C&S describes as a correspondent
associate, for information only. That’s what it says.
But I think when you look at the text of these
things, it’s quite clear that these copies for information only
were just not sent out in order to keep the officials of these
five-percent banks informed as to what C&S was doing or what
C&S was thinking.

They leave no doubt, we think, that C&S

intended them to be followed.
Let me just cite three examples.
QUESTIONS To what point now do you direct these
examples, Mr. Friedman?
MR, FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

This is to show’ —

You’re speaking of the past situation,

aren’t you?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, they’re not that far —

QUESTION: The five-percent arrangement?

21
MR. FRIEDMANs
QUESTION:

The five-percent arrangement.

Yes.

MR. FRIEDMAN;

This is directed to show that in fact

this wasn't just a situation in which C&S gave out some
ideas and these banks voluntarily said;

This sounds like a

good thing to do, we'll independently follow it.
This is all designed to show that in fact, in fact
what you had in this situation was an agreement in violation
of Section 1 of the Sherman Act between C&S and the fivepercent banks, that they were to eliminate competition,» in
every thing including price? and one of -the purposes of these
examples is to show that C&S was in effect telling the fivepercent banks what to charge, what practices to follow.
Let me just ~~
QUESTION: Does that also suggest «—• doesn't that
lessen the distinction that you were previously making between
the situation as it was and the situation as it will be after
the acquisition?
MR. FRIEDMANS
QUESTIONs

No, now it ~

It seems to me you're narrowing the gap

when you press that point.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, Mr. Justice, obviously if, as

we say and as they concede, in effect, there's no competition,
barring the acquisitions will not directly increase competi­
tion? what it will do, though, is to keep alive the potential

22
for possible deconcentration of these concentrated banking
markets, which this Court has recognized repeatedly is one
of the functions under Section 7„
But, in addition to that, coming back to what I said
before, just

to repeat it, that we don't think they can rely

on the violations of Section 1 — on violations of Section 1 —
as a justification for a merger that is prima facie in viola­
tion of Section 7„
Now, these, if I may refer to these, a couple of
■these things*

The first one is E-140.

And I should mention that this record is paginated
that the Exhibit volumes are separately paginated beginning
with E-l.
Now, this is a note which goes not just to the CSS
officials with an information copy, but this is directly
written, typed out, to the Presidents of the Correspondent
Associates, which are the five-percent banks;
"Effective November 12 the C&S National Bank" -that's the lead bank — "lowered its prime rate to 7-1/4 per­
cent.

For the time being this will affect only those rates

tliat are tied to the prims. All other rates will remain the
same until further notice»

If you should have any questions,

please give me a call."
This is from the Assist* nt Vice President of the
Division of Branch Superintendent.

23
Then at E-145, is to all of the Managers and the
Affiliates with, again, Information Copy to the President of
•the five-percent hanks;
"Enclosed is a memorandum and revised rate chart
from Gordon Trulock.

As always, the chart reflects the

minimum rate which should be charged."
And then at the bottom of the paragraph:
"Loans to local corporations should carry a rate of
at least 10 percent."
And finally at page E-147, a 1969 memorandum saying:
"Rates on all L s D loans except prime customers
should ba adjusted to 8 percent."
And then it goes on at the bottom of that page and
says;
"We are still not making speculative real estate and
development loans."
QUESTION:

Mr, Friedman, you say this supports —

would support a finding of an agreement not to compete?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

We would «*- I'd go stronger -*-han

that? I'd go stronger than that, Mr. Justice.

This, we think,

compels — compels the conclusion that what was done here
was the result of an agreement of a combination of a concerted
action.

But this
QUESTION: Did the government submit proposed findings

to the district court to this effect?

24
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTIONS

Yes, yes, we did.

And the district court refused to mate

this finding.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
court found

The district court -- what the district

the district court found in this case that this

was not the result of any agreement because, as it put it,
this **~ it denied that the service or information received by
these banks from C&S was the result of any tacit or explicit
combinations, rather than the natural deference of the recipient
to information from one with greater expertise or better
sources.

But -QUESTION;

So the government upset the district

court’s conclusion as to say that it's clearly erroneous?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

We think — we ’think the ultimate

finding, the ultimate finding of no agreement in this case is
clearly erroneous.

It’s clearly erroneous because we think it

fails to recognise the many decisions of this court defining
what constitutes an agreement for purposes of section 1 of
the Sherman Act.
Under Section 1

you don’t have to have an explicit

agreement, it’s rare that you have that.
conduct and

It’s a course of

you look at the entire course of conduct to deter­

mine whether what happened was the result of wholly independent
business judgment or whether it was the result of some tacit
undersbanding

How, I suggest that it's difficult to believe that
wholly independent banks, that wholly independent banks, with
their own offices, with their own boards of directors,
responsible to all of the stockholders, would permit a fivepercent stockholder to have an advisory director sitting with
them at all tine board meetings, to have a five-percent bank
stockholder review their loans, would follow all of these
instructions, raising prices, changing prices, failing to
change prices when C&S objected; that they would have done
that without there being some tacit understanding that this
is how the banks were going to operate„
We think it is very clear from the whole record in
this case that it was understood, it was understood that this
is how it was going to operate, and this is the way it

operated„
Let me give one very -QUESTION;

And plus the name on the front, on

the front of the building,,
MR, FRIEDMAN;

Plus the name.

Thank you, Mr™

Jus tice„
Normally, an independent bank without some under­
standing wouldn't permit its business to be operated under
the name of someone else™

And wouldn't permit its customers

to have available at it all the services that are supplied
to five-percent stockholders»

26
Let me just give one very illuminating example, I
think, of ‘the kind of relationship and control you had in this
case, which is something we cited in our reply brief»

The

president of the Bank of Chamblee, one of the five Citizens
and Southern Bank of Chamblee, wanted to raise his interest
rates on deposits from three and a half to four percent,,
Because he felt he needed this to compete with another local
bank in the area»
But before he undertook this step, he felt it
necessary to write to C&S and find out if they had any objection
to it.

So he so wrote, and he then had a discussion with a

C&S official who objected, and the result of it was the
president of Chamblee did not raise his interest rates to four
percent»
We had another example, described in our main brief
at pages 11 .in a lengthy footnote, footnote 2, that C&S put
out an announcement that it was changing and increasing its
service rates on checking accounts»

It didn’t state the date»

This was in February 1970»
Many of the five-percent banks had different service
rates.

But on the 1st of April all of a sudden all of them,

all of them, every one of them suddenly adopted uniform rates
on not only the special checking accounts but trie regular
checking accounts, rates that were uniform with those that C&S
had cidopted.

27
Now, the argument is made, to which Mr» Justice
Powell alluded earlier, that this is perfectly all right
because if it hadn't been for the restrictions of the Georgia
banking law the banks -would have been organised initially as
branches of C&S, and if they had been branches of C&S. every­
thing that we challenge would have been permissible.
Now, these banks, as I want to repeat again because
I think it's at the crux of our case, these banks are separate
entities.

These banks are separate entities.

And as separate

entities, and as separate entities, these banks have to
operate the way the Sherman Act requires
entities.

for separate

They cannot themselves eliminate and restrain

competition between them.
Let me, if I may, read two sentences from the Court's
opinion in the Perma Life Muffler case, in 392 U.S., where
— that was a private case, and the Court of Appeals had
dismissed the Sherman Act claim on the theory that the -two
respondents, Midas and its parent which owned all of the
stock International, were a single entity and therefore
incapable of conspiracy.
And the Court rejected that argument.
was:. But

What it said

since the respondents, Midas and International,

avail themselves of the privilege of doing business through
separate corporations, the fact of common ownership could not
save them from any of the obligations that the lav; imposes on

28

separate entities»
That was a ease where they were wholly owned sub­
sidiaries.

This is a case where they are only five-percent

subsidiaries„
Now, the -- let me turn to one other aspect of this
case.

The district court said, as an alternative ground of

dismissing the complaint, that this was a matter that lay
wholly within the exclusive primary jurisdiction of the Federal
Reserve Board.
It's a rather technical argument, it turns on the
language of the Banking Holding Company Act.
fully covered it in cur brief.

We have, I believe,

I just summarise in a sentence

or two that the Bank Holding Act authorises the Board to
approve acquisitions, mergers or consolidations, or acquisitions
of control.
And that's the only thing it gives the Board
jurisdiction over.
Our challenge, as I have indicated, is not to the
acquisition or to the control as such, but to the way in which
they exercised it.

And there's a specific provision in the

Bank Holding Company Act which we have set forth at page 47 of
our brief that says;

nothing in this in any way prevents the

liability under the antitrust laws.
And we think that whatever one may think of the role
of the Federal Reserve Board in dealing with this situation.

29

quite clearly it is covered b?/ this exemption.
Now, the district court in this case assumed, for
purposes of discussion under the Section 7 issue, the markets
that the government had posited, it didn't define the markets.
And if we are correct in our submission to this Court, the case
must b© remanded for the district court to define the relevant
markets„
And it also set forth in considerable detail the
increases in concentration that would result in the event
this merger took place, but then it said:

all of this really

is beside the point because, as a result of what has
previously happened, there is no competition now between C&S
and the five-percent banks.
In other words, what they * re saying is that the
defendants can overcome the prima facie illegality of this
merger under the settled standards, because of their own
violations of Section !„
We think, as we've said in our brief, this would
just stand Section 7 on its head.

The purpose of Section 7 is

to prevent these restraints at the outset, in their insipiency,
\

before they develop into full-blown violations of Section 1»
Now the claim is that the full-blown violation of
Section 1 somehow saves from illegality a. merger xdiich, had
it not been for that violation under this Court's standards,
would be illegal.

And we don't think that is the way Section

30
7 can be read, and we think that under this Court’s decisions,
tliis merger — the arrangements violate Section 1 and the merger
cannot pass muster under Section 7.
QUESTION: Well, are you saying that each one of these
five-percent situations was a violation, or only that taken
all together, against, this whole background, that that would
violate it?
%

MR» FRIEDMANs

I would say each one was -— I would

say each one, Mr. Justice, was? because in each case, each
five-percent bank was an independent entity, and in each
instance what you had was the complete elimination of competition
between C&s and the five-percent banks.
Indeed, in one case, in the Bank of Tucker, that. I
mentioned earlier, for from 1919 to 1965, Tucker was a wholly
independent bank, and then C&S acquired a five percent interest
in Tucker, changed its name to the Bank of Tucker and proceeded
to treat it as though it were a branch»
I think this is the clearest example? but the others
never had even a chance to develop its independent entities.
From the outset, C&S stifled their competitive potential»
QUESTION:

Mr» Friedman, do you think we need any

market analysis in the case at all, on the Sherman Act part?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I don’t believe sc, Mr» Justice»

QUESTION: Well, just tell me, what is the per se
violation?

31
MR. FRIEDMANS
QUESTION;

That they —

Just an agreement not to compete?

Is that what you say?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

An agreement and understanding not

to compete at all* in any way? not just fixing prices* but
not to compete in any way.
QUESTION;

So if a price-fixing agreement is per

se* this is a fortiori?
MR® FRIEDftAN;

That’s correct®

That is our

position®
QUESTION;
QUESTION;

Yes®
Well* what if a bank in Birmingham agreed

with a bank in Atlanta not to compete* and in fact there was
no real realistic possibility of competition between them*
would that be a violation of the Sherman Act?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

If there was no realistic possibility

at all* if they were completely independent* I doubt it very
much. But that’s not this case.

That’s not this case* Mr®

Justice.
Because CSS itself had three subsidiaries in which
it owned 90 percent or more of the stock, which* conceivably*
might have been competing with these banks®

We don’t know®

But this —
QUESTION:

But don’t you have to know something about

the market* then, in order to answer Justice White’s question?

32
MR* FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

Well, I think we

I interpreted

Well, you know that much? you know that.

much.
MR. FRIEDMAN5

Yes,

I interpreted Justice White's

question as meaning whether it would be necessary to define a
market in the way that it's normally defined for Section 7
purposes.

My answer is no, not under Section 1,
But this is all the Atlanta — this is in the Atlanta

area and these are suburban banks and there is -- there is, for
example, the record shows that not infrequently

people may

want to — there's a question whether you want a bank where
you live out in the suburbs or whether you're going to bank in
town.

If it's an independent bank, you may decide to bank in

the suburbs and not bank in town.
So there could have been, we think, very real
competitive potential between CSS and truly independent banks
in the suburbs, independent banks that were not operated by
C&S as branches.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Hodgson

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL Btt HODGSONf ESQ.f
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR0 HODGSONs

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
We would like to approach our argument today this
way:
First, we would like to touch on some of the facts
that we believe should have emphasis in order to lend
importance to our responses to the government’s grave
charge So
Secondly, we would like to make our argument that
because C&S and its associated five-percent banks have been
so closely related from the very beginning without change,
no lessening of competition would result from the acquisitions
And then we would like to answer the Department's
charges that these relationships are in violation of the
Sherman Act.

In some instances it appears to be claimed per

se by virtue of the entire association between these banks,
and then again it appears to be per se basically on the price
information memoranda that have been discussed this morning.
Then we would like to discuss what is perhaps the
most important charge, whether or not the association amounts
to an unreasonable restraint, absent a per se finding.
And then we would like to conclude with our thesis
that an affirmance by this Court would bring only beneficial

competitive results <.
Now, the Department has very lightly and selectively
touched upon some of the facts, although it has surely not
misrepresented them,
I think it's important for us to place ourselves in
the environment in which all of this conduct took place»
The city of Metropolitan Atlanta has exploded in the
last two decade, or a decade and a halfo

There are no geo­

graphical barriers or restrictions to this growth, and it has
been heavy»

But the political response to this growth has

not been comparabis»
The city of Atlanta has been restrained since 1952
to a bare city limits of a mean radius of seven miles, and
there seems to be no hope to get that remedied»
It is surrounded by numerous small towns and villages
and small cities»
At the time the case was tried, the standard
metropolitan statistical area encompassed five counties, with
a rough radius of 25 miles, much larger; and today the same
area is fifteen counties, with a rough radius of 40 miles»
Now, as these political restrictions on city limits
are clear, it is also clear that the limitations on internal
extension and expansion by banks in the State of Georgia
has been seriously restricted»

Because, beginning as early as

1927, no branching has been allowed in the State of Georgia,

35
except within the city limits where the bank is located»
And until 1960 they could not expand even where they had
only branches.

Only 13 States continue so basolutely to

restrain internal bank expansion.

None of Georgia's neighbors

does,
The C&S system is expansive~minded, it is aggressive.
In 1928 it met these barriers by forming a holding company,»
which, over a period of the next twenty-odd years, formed
/
eight majority owned affiliates throughout the State, three
of which are in metropolitan Atlanta,
But in 1956 a barrier was put up again, and today
no bank, no bank holding company may expand through the holding
company affiliation route in the State of Georgia,
The legislative forces supported by the protectionist
demands of the unit bankers in the State, as we see it, have
drawn hard bctrriers against competitive expansion or market
extension, barriers drawn sharply at the city limits.
Now, the purpose of this historic exercise is to
demonstrate why this was done. There was no purpose here to
do anything in violation of antitrust laws.

It’s simply

that there was developed an innovative and entirely procompetitive expansion procedure, which had to observe the
requirements, the restrictions on stock ownership required by
the State Bank

Holding Company law.

So here is what was dones

Let’s leave out Tucker for a moment»
With respect to the five banks which are before this
Court today on the Section 7 charge, it, C&S, organised these
new banks? it didn't participate with others in doing so, it
organized them in areas where banks had never been before,
and beyond the city limits of Atlanta, where C&S could not go
and could not compete.

And could not, until the lav; was changed,

allowing these applications for merger.
Second, it did so in instances where other local
interests

had tried and failed — and this is in the record —

had tried and failed because of absence of significant financial
footings and banking know-how.
It was done in every instance with the expectation of
everyone involved, all of the shareholders — and the record is
replete with this — the neighbors, the competitors all knew
that it was formed this way, under C&S sponsorship, to be
managed by C&S so far as lav; permitted, ultimately to merge
into C&S,
And this procedure was supported by the responsible
bank regulators, State and federal, realizing that the strength
of C&S financial and managerial support would be behind these
new little banks and thus would insure their solvency and their
success, and serve the convenience and needs of these
communities, which otherwise were not being served. And -the
record is clear that others had tried

37

These historic organisational factors are unique,,
and they were complete from the beginning.
change.

They did not

The Department said this was competitively insignifi­

cant when made? the district court found there were no changes
in this respect and the burden was on the government to prove
it if it were so from the time they were formed until the
time this case was triod0
I would not mention the Stone Mountain Bank except
that it's been brought up here, because the record is so clear,
so clear.

C&S did not organize that bank, it had been .in
9

existence two years before any affiliation occurred.
was asked by the Stone Mountain incorporators:

C&S

Do you have

anyone xdrio can help us?
They said, Yes, sir, there*s a fellow named Arthur
Drew 'who used to work for C&S, he's retired, he might help
you.
He was the motivating force there.

It is clear

that the McCurdy family owned 35 percent of the stock of that
bank.

It is also clear that there was continued resistance

to support and advice from C&S to that bank, and the district
court found that it was not a comparable circumstance.
Just as it did with the Peachtree Bank and Trust Company, the
trust company's affiliate in the Chamblee araa, which
likewise had serious distinguishing characteristics which
do not appear in this case.

They are not appropriate for

38
argument that these banks would break away, would become
independent competitive forces; and the district court found
tliat as a fact, also.
Mow, during the decade of the Sixties,

all six of

these little banks, including Tucker for this purpose, retained
the following important characteristics which further dis­
tinguished thorns
The ownership of shares, stock shares, over and
above that held by the holding company, the five percent
permitted by State law was spread among many individuals,
there were no blocks.
Any concentration being in the chief executive
officer of the five-percent associated bank, and many officers,
directors and friends of C&5 generally, who were aware of the
purpose and intent of this program to supply these services
in these areas.
These five-percenters were authorized to use the C&S
name and share in joint, identification with C&S services
advising
the public they were competing as C&S banks,
\
Now, the point is made — this happened later **QUESTIONS

This was in no way a violation of State

law to use the C&S name?
MR, HODGSON2

No, sir, if Your Honor please, it is

not, as long as you get consent from the Commissioner of Banking
Finance, then Superintendent of Banks, it is perfectly all

39

right*.

Just as it is for the Coca-Cola Company to authorise

the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Thomasvi1le f the Coca-Cola
Bottling Company of Albany, and so forth.
QUESTION: Well, those are franchisees.
MR. HODCSON:

Very similar, if Your Honor please,

in an area where, at this point in time, C&S could not go.
Could not have its own direct operation®
QUESTION:

Yes. Righ fc.

MR® HODGSON:

Let me say, something has been made

of the fact that the name was not part of the original
package®

Well, for most it was, the later ones®

And the

earlier ones, it was no surprise to anyone. The record is
complete, that all knew these were C&S banks®

The Citizens

Bank of Sandy Springs, for example, had its lollipop, C for
Citizens and S for Sandy Springs®

There was no doubt in

anyone’s mind that these were C&S banks, owned by the —■ by
other stockholders because this was required? but operated
by C&S in order to supply these services there®
A third critical distinction is that full C&S
services and advice were regularly

and systematically

supplied, and no one offended the requirements of corporate
law and the fiduciary duties imposed upon the directors and
officers to serve their shareholders ? but this information
expertly was supplied by C&S to these little banks, including
categories of services that were not routinely furnished to

40

correspondents»
none whatsoever»

There were no secrets about these services,
Anyone can see any of them they want to see.

Most importantly, these services were expected and
relied upon by these little banks.

Otherwise, the regulators

would not have issued charters in the first place.

And, as I

suggested, there was the express intent and expectation to
merge just as soon as State law, the restrictive branching
law or the restrictive holding company law, permitted this to
be done de jure.
May we observe at this point that when the General
Assembly of Georgia allowed branch expansion into the counties,
which isn’t much, immediately, indeed foreseeing this in
January 1, ’71, these applications were, filed.

And they were

described in the application, a copy of which went to the
Department of Justice, as being virtually operated and directed
as de facto branches. There was no secret about it then, as
there had never been.
This was the very language which the Department used
before this Court four years later in the Marine case, to
describe what it called a sanctioned pr©competitive procedure
in instances where de novo branching, de jure branching was
denied.
The regulators knew it, and all of the competitors
of CSS and these banks were precisely interviewed by the
Commissioner of Banking Finance, to see whether or not they

41
had objection, and they had none»

Why?

Because they were

C&S banks from the beginning»
And then the Department filed this suit, which
stayed the. acquisitions, charged for the first time, the first
news we had, that these were charges of having engaged in
violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act»
We argue, of course, -that because CSS and its
associated banks have been so closely related from the
beginning, that no lessening of competition could possibly
result from these acquisitions.
The Department relies on market statistics»

You

heard the argument this morning.
But the Department neglected to present any evidence
relating those statistics to the circumstances of this case,
so far as Sherman 7 is concerned.
Most importantly, its own economic esspert, Dr»
Skogstad, testified that he did not take into account the
relationship between C&S and its associated banks when he
was examining the economic consequences of the proposed
transactions.

That which he did not take into account is

at the heart of this case.
Our case is C&S market shares, for purposes of
applying the standards of the Bank Merger Act or of Section 7
of the Clayton Act, have always included the market shares of
its associates.

Since the; fiva-percent banks have never

42

competed as anything but. CSS banks.
They were created de novo by CSS for that very purpose»
They are part of a single enterprise in fact and in substance,,
though they take the separate corporate form only to avoid
violation of the State Bank

Holding Company law»

And without that organization, the evidence is clear
that the separate competitive forces in DsKalb County and
beyond the city limits of Atlanta would not be in the market­
place today»
Put another ways

at the very time that these small

banks were organized, a de facto merger took place»

De facto

by open and notorious behavior and declared intent not de jure
because of restrictive Stata law.

The form being used only

in order to allow market extension without violation of that
law.
The substance was to produce de facto branches, and
for purposes of applying the antitrust laws which deal with
competitive and anticompetitive purpose and effect, the teachings
of this Court tell us to look to substance and not form»
Indeed, the Department’s own authorities take us this wayi and
indeed this is the very procedure the Department sanctioned
in Marine,
This is what it said:

Banks in the State of Washing­

ton have achieved de novo entry into areas foreclosed to de novo
brandling by sponsoring the organization of an affiliate bank

43
and later acquiring the bank.
Since the associates were ereatad by and have always
competed as C&S banks through this entire history, for every
intent and purpose, there is no possibility that a formal
corporate reorganization will produce anything but the same
corporate substance and the same competitive statistics»
The Department said that when the original sponsor­
ship of the new banks and C&S commitment to the chartering
authorities was made, this did not violate the Act,

The

obligation on the part of C&S and the expectation of these
little banks that C&S would supply them full management
counsel and advice, the Department declared was competitively
insignificant.
The district court found later the government has
not carried its burden of demonstrating any substantial
increase in the degree of control ox* change in quantity of
competition between the date of initial acquisitions and
the date of trial.
If competitively insignificant when created, and
if all that’s happened since that time has been the carrying
out of the original obligations, openly declared and known,
the perpetuation of an association must likewise be competi­
tively insignificant where no change has occurred.
The district court so found.
The only -tiling that would prompt any further

44
argument before this Court today is the charge made by the
Department that the relationships that are involved here
violate the Sherman Act, and so we turn to those charges.
As we do so, we ask the Court carefully to notice
the Department's total failure to prove a nexus between the
alleged Section 1 violations that are so broadly and vaguely
talked about here today, and the Section 7 complaint,,
The Department assumes -- take away the behavior
which it's hard to describe, it charges violates Section 1
and the cement holding the association will break apart, and
C&S and its associated banks will compete aggressively with
one another.
The assumptions are not proved anywhere in this
record, and they are not logical.

The name and the public

identification would not be removed* the associated operations
would remain* the expectation of being merged and ‘the realizetion of being part of the C&S system would remain? the nature
of the competitive posture in the marketplace would not change.
They would continue to function as C&S banks, and the public
and the competitors would continue so to see them as they always
have, and to use them that way.

a single competitive force in

separate markets, as they have always bean.
Even if the issuance of these memos, that so much is
made of, or the obtaining of the information from C&S related
to pricing and hours were condemned, even though it*s used only

45

as a part of a large bit of information, that these small
banks exercised to determine their own competitive strategy,
that v/ould not affect the relationships, not because the
conduct is in this case trivial, which it is, but because
the associate bank officers would continue to determine their

,

charges and their rates independently with their boards

as

they have testified they now do»
Finally —
QUESTION: They would be capable of this emancipa­
tion that I discussed with Mr» Friedman, would they not?
MR. HODGSON:

Oh, Mr» Chief Justice, indeed they

would, be capable of this emancipation, as they always have
been.

As I believe in almost any similar circurastancesi but

the evidence is clear from all parties in their polls, and
their testimony was broad spread, and comprehensive share­
holders, directors, officers, employees, everyone alike, that
there was no probability of this#
Before the FDIC, this question was raised, that's a
very tough agency over there, and they raised this question,

amounts of information to demonstrate that this was, though
possible, was absolutely improbable, which is the standard
that this Court must apply»

This same procedure was foil wed

through in the district court.

So when people ~~ and people sometimes

need money, they sell their stock, and sometimes they die,
and so the stock may not be in the same hands forever.
MR, HODGSON:

Yes, sir.

But I believe that such

could have been the case in Trans-"Texas, of course, which
really proves another point.

little movement in sales of this stock in the period of -QUESTION;

What about the hypothetical bank that

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think, asked you about, the bank
over in Birmingham; suppose they set out on a plan to buy up
all of the stock that got available in any one of these five
banks, against the possibility that one day they might want
to enter that market?
MR. HODGSON:

I don't believe much would be sold,

if Your Honor please, but it's totally hypothetical.

There's

a series of affidavits in the file in this case, that we got
up fer FDIC, we went around and solicited all the shareholders,

and they all affirmed that they liked it with C&S and they
weran't interested in selling, and they know C&S management and
they know the success of C&S in the State of Georgia»

They

know C&S knows its business*
I really believe they would not be inclined to sell.
It’s kind of hard to round up that kind of stock.

Most importantly, we *■>*QUESTION:

I suppose it's also very difficult, that

hypothetical question, for you to answer or to meet.

it is possible, isn't it?
MR. HODGSON: . Oh, if Your Honor please, of course
it's possible.

And I could not responsibly stand here and

argue to the other — to the opposite, as much as I would be
inclined to believe,
QUESTION:

It is also a fact, an economic fact, in

some localities that when banks of this kind are organized the
stockholders look down the road to the day when laws will
permit mergers, and then they will acquire the stock of the
C&S bank,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL B. HODGSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. HODGSON:

— Resumed

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court again:
May we conclude our argument with respect to the
Section 7 charges by reminding the Court that the district
court’s finding, just like that of the corporation before it,
foresaw no probability of a change in the relationship, which
is a finding exactly like that of the district court in
General Dynamics, we submit, where the Court foresaw no new
co-reserves being found»

And likewise that finding, unless

it's charged as being clearly erroneous, which it has not,
should be affirmed by this Court,
Turning to the Sherman Act charges, let me say that
it's our strong view at the outset that this is just not a
Sherman Act case.

And we believe that through our briefs and

argument we can satisfy the Court that it's nothing more than

50

a means the Department would use in this case to frustrate these
mergers,
Nov;, let us look at the charges that the Department
makes as being violations.
First, sort of a two“headed charge, the best we can
determine it, of a per se

violation,

Nov;, preliminarily, may I say one other thing?

We

are not asking this Court for any exemption or pardon from any
Sherman Act violations.
But we do urge this Court not to extend its per se
doctrine to the totality of the procompetitive and beneficial
behavior that the record discloses in this case.

And we ask

this Court to restrict the application of the per se doctrine
to such pertinent issues conduct as real price fixing, real
market allocation, and real boycotts.
Otherwise, to so extend it, it occurs to us, would
require that a merger agreement itself would become a per se
violation, and obviously that cannot be the case.
Now, we would think that a real per se violation is
glaringly evident to anyone, especially to the public officers
charged with enforcing those laws and to the competitors of
the charged defenders.

We all know that is where they are

first ascertained.
They were and they are glaringly and immediately
evident in all of the cases cited by the Department to prove

51
conspiracy in the absence of an express agreement.
Why?
Because the behavior reflected in the records in
those cases so clearly reflect a clear, flagrant, naked and
offensive purpose and effect, either to fix prices to
restrain trade, allocate markets or customers, or eliminate
competition.

There is none such here.

Much less a combination of separate firms to maintain
prices above a competitive figure.

A class definition of a

cartel.
Mot';, if a per se violation exists by virtue of the
totality of behavior* that was openly involved in the
associations of this case, well known to the regulators and
tie public alike, why did not tie Department see it, and at
least call attention to it when it participated in 1968,
now, in the Federal Reserve Board hearing?
It can only be because it was not perceived as such.
It simply wasn't recognized as such.
And we cannot perceive it as such today.
It was to this very argument I make that the district
court found the Department of Justice acquiescence in the 1968
in an understanding involving the more substantial elements of
what it now claims to be Section 1 violations, is indicative
to at least a small degree that such practices were not so
violently anticompetitive as to constitute per se violations,

52
Inaction, the district court said, by the Department
of Justice, with such knowledge, would have been a violation of
its public duty and the court does not impute such negligent
inaction to it, nor do we.
The very same associations, the very same transactions
involved in this case, with these five banks, was involved in
1969 with the acquisition of a small bank called the C&S
Belvedere Bank.

What did tine Department perceive then?

Sherman Act violations?

Not a one.

And yet we must concede that none were perceived
because the factors were the same.

And the Department noted

that the Citizens and Southern Holding Company has had full
management control of Belvedere Bank since its inception,,
Going on to say, the situation is not unlike de novo branch
banking in those States where such activity is lawful„
The Department noted no violations in its first
competitive report in this case, when it noted the reorganiza­
tions were essentially internal and the parties had never
represented independent competitive forces.

A competitive

posture, the Department now says that C&S and its associates.,
in separate markets, must take toward each other, just for one
reason only:

just because they are organized in the form of

separate corporate bodies.
And even when the Department reversed its competitive
position letter in February of '71, it did so not on the grounds

53

that the relationship and the behavior between the persons
violated the Sherman Act? because of the very opposite:
it concluded that the associated banks wo re not necessarily
controlled by C&S.
Now, we have never understood the consistency of the
Department's position with respect to our transactions, but
that's really beside the point»

We want to make it clear

today that we do not charge the Department with bad faith«
On the contrary — and we surely do not claim an estoppel»
I doubt it would be available„
But we cite these instances to clearly and unequivo­
cally demonstrate that no Sherman Act violations were apparent,
even to the expert eye„ in the sponsorship and managerial
relationships that are part of these associations? much le.ss
per se violations»
If not then, not now.
Indeed, the first time that Sherman was charged was
in the complaint, denominated vaguely a close working
relationship»

In the Jurisdictional Statement to this Court,

the charge became:

interchanges of information, personnel and

other resources, leading to lack of competition.
We say there never was any.

You could not lead to

it if there never was any.
The ingredients of a per se cheirge did not even
then appear, and the nature of the restraint did not appear.

54
Only in the brief before this Court did we first
hear that we were charged with a per se violation»
The brief says in one placer

not merely the exchange

of past price information which affects current pricing
practices —- that’s contained in its progeny -- but a mutual
understanding to fix actual current prices, a classic per se
offense.
Citing Socony-Vacuum and Parke Davis»
Not even 'the most biased reading of the evidence
in this case will reflect a single factual circumstance similar
to Sc cony-Vacuum and Parke Davis, or any of the other per se
cases cited, Masonite, Bausch & bomb, Kiefer-Stew art, General
Motors, Singer, and Perma Life,
violations.

they are all flagrant

Clearly so.

In every one of the sets of circumstances in those
cases, the sole purpose and the overwhelming effect was to
fix prices, really fix them, to maintain markets, allocate
customers.

It strains reason to suggest that the relationships

here between CSS and its associated banks that it formed, many
of these services at the heart of the correspondent bank
relationship, many of them essential to franchise dealings,
many of them the focal point of management consultation
services, indeed anyone’s imagination familiar with the
commercial world can come up with many similarities to these
sorts of relationships.

55

All of them in this case calculated to supply new
competitive forces to new markets, and if it's followed by
such advice as to make the successful operation of these
little banks as associated competitors in their separate
markets, it strains reason to suggest that such relationships
could possibly be found to be conspiracies in restraint of
trade, much less of such predatory and unconscionable
character, so lacking

in redeeming virtue as to allow no

inquiry into the purpose or effect or the reasonableness
of the association, a conclusion entirely necessary for their
being categorised per se»
Take the entire relationship as an onion,peel back

Sven the Department

admitted here today that each layer, standing alone, is no
violation? possibly the pricing memoranda which we will come
to.
Yet somehow the whole onion, taken together, becomes

This Court

Loose common ownership over the

bulk of the stock is no violation; Trans-Texas and many others,
ilcnstabiUsing furnishing of price information is
not a per se violation, container and progeny.
Surely the supply of personnel, operation, security,
accounting, arid all of the other services cannot be violations

56
of the Sherman Act*

Anyone with the time -- and this Court

hasn't the time, I fear -- but anyone with the time, going
through two volumes of the Joint Appendix, the Consumer
Credit Guide that inadvertently got in the record, but I'm glad
it's there now, if you have time to thumb through two volumes,
being just the Consumer Credit Guide, look at the multitude
of information that has to be available to a young bank, a
small bank, in order to compete in today's complex, highly
regulated market.
How can this be a per se violation?
The district court found it nonviolafcive and should
be affirmed.

But now the Department charges that certain

memoranda, circulated to five-percent banks ™- and, incidentally,
everyone else in the system —• relating to rates, charges and
hours, were conclusive evidence of price-fixing and therefore a
per se violation.
Now, if it were the law -- if it were the law that the
existence of such memoranda, standing alone, creates an
irrebutable presumption of price-fixing, in- violation of the
Sherman Act, then, coupled with authorities holding that a
per se violation is such a violation as can have no redeeming
virtues, the district court would summarily have found that this
particular behavior was unlawful and he would have enjoined it.
He found to the contrary»
We know of no law or decision, further, that says that

such memoranda, standing alone, create an irrebutable presump­
tion that a conspiracy to fix prices exists, or that any other
per sa violation has been proved»
Further, it is clear from the record that these
memoranda alone are but a small and unimportant aspect of
the entire relationship between C&S and its associates, .much
more important to the branch banks to which they went*

And

their prohibition would in no way, if you would eliminate
them all, affect the closeness of the relationships or the
propriety of the acquisitions.
What rational purpose could have been served by CSS
and -these associated banks making an agreement or having a
tacit understanding to fix prices in these separate markets?
The Department has suggested none, and we can conceive of none
We can only believe that it would be harmful»
There was no evidence whatever that the occasional
transmissions of this information relative to price in any
way resulted in stabilisation.
Mow, C&S in its system has always been extremely
conservative and cautious about the Sherman Act, and although
one could wall make an argument -that this being a single
enterprise, sorts of conduct that are generally prosecutable
under this Act couldn’t occur.
But to be doubly cautious, memoranda have been
consistently going out, and they are in this record, obliging

58
separate entities to make their pricing and their charging
decisions separately and independently.

All were reminded

frequently of the criminal illegality of agreements between
banks relating to prices.
And everyone whose testimony was taken in this case*,
without exception, the testimony of every principal officer of
the five-percent banks, of directors of the five-percent banks,
said that out of an abundance of caution we set our own
pricing standards and our own charges.

Sure, we use the C&S

information, it was handy, and they are pretty good, too; and
we took that into account. But we also probed the competition.
We took the various financial journals.

We knew what was going

on at the Fed, and we knew what xvas going on particularly with
respect to our competitors.

And then we set our prices.

Furthermore, a close look at the evidence discloses
that while the government points an accusatory finger at these
memos which, standing alone, might have been a circumstance
that could lead to a determination that you had a violation,
it neglects to note that these memoranda were but the smallest
part of the whole continuing advisory service to all branches,
affiliates and associates.
It fails to note that the information contained in
these memos was only a portion of the marketing information
obtained by the associate banks in setting

their prices.

It

fails to note that there is a multitude of evidence that all of

59

these men well knew what the service charges deposed on
deposit accounts, and the interest paid on savings accounts
ware aroong all of the competition*

And changes of such

rates and changes of such deposit charges are typically
announced in full-page newspaper ads and on radio and TV spots.
They are no secret.
The Department fails to observe that the evidence is
clear in this case that shows extreme variations of rates
charged on loans, and substantial variations on service
charges and interest paid, as between the C&S and its
associates.
Now, Mr. Friedman has argued about Mr. Harris'
testimony about consulting dovrntown about something.

Allow

me, if I may, to give you some other of his evidence, and the
best way X know to do is to put this to you this way — and,
if you have time, to read the depositions of each of the
bank officers of these little banks.
profitable.

It will be extremely

You will see that this is a charge without

substance.
Question to Hr. Harris:
"How did you decide on the initial service charges
on checking accounts when the bank opened?
"We took those that were used by every bank in
Atlanta."

Canvassed the market.
Question:

"Before making a change in service

60
charges on checking accounts , would you also review that with
C&S?
"Yes.

We would, but we have to review more with the

area generally than with just C&S because I can1t have a charge
out there that’s varies too widely from the ether banks because
people will move their account from one bank.

After all, all

the banks have offices around there, and I*ve got to stay pretty
close to what the downtown banks charge."
"I used C&S every way possible to help in making
decisions.

I conferred with them on many points.

Then we'd

discuss it with the directors and we * d try to get all the
information from whatever source we could.

We took every

banking magazine, periodical, trying to stay £>reast of what was
going on.

So that with many of these things it was just part

of the movement in the money market, and you had to follow it."
This testimony is not just an earnest denial of no
violation or no unlawful conduct, it’s an honest report of
telling .it like it is.
Information, obtained from C&S along with information
obtained from many other sources, competitors, the market
generally, and publications, was used to arrive et independently
established rates, charges and hour’s.
I would not have mentioned this, but Mr. Friedman
makes much of what we thought we had put to rest in our brief
tliis morning.

61

The change by all of these banks suddenly to a lower
service charge,,
He didn't mention it was lower, but it was.
Now, the testimony is clear and it's specifically
referred to in our brief, that hare's what happened:
The Trust Company of Georgia, a major competitor,
came out with full-page ads one day that said:

We are

reducing the service charge on our deposit accounts from a
minimum of 500 to a minimum of 250.
Well now, what do you think everyone did when they
saw that?
They said:

Good Lord, they're going to take all

our accounts ? we've got to find out about this.
And they all scurried around and found out what
happened.
What did CfiS do?

Nov/, C&S has a more significant

research department than do the five-percent banks»

It

determined that this could be done without a significant
threat to the profitability of the operation of these deposit
accounts, and it so advised everybody.
l So what did they do?

They met the competition of

the lower service charge.
Now, that's what happened in this case, if you
really examine the record.
I do not believe that that is the sort of tiling

62
that this Court is going to condemn as a per se violation of
the Sherman Act.
The Department has cited no authority that requires
this behavior, either the entire associate relationship or the
furnishing of these memos be found a violation of the Sherman
Act, much less per se.
Mor do the facts permit such a conclusion, had the
district court been so inclined.

We would have been here on

te appellant's side.But, instead, the district court found these
activities, however, do not amount to collusive price-firing.
If there is no per so violation, then the question
becomes*

Have the parties so combined as to produce an

unreasonable restraint?
The Department argues, just because apparently «—
just because they are incorporated separately, they are obligated
to compete vigorously, or at least that C&S should abandon its
sponsored banks.
No authorities are cited for this prop©sita.on.

And

totally ignores the single reason for the choice of the separata
corporate form, which turns out to be a nuisanc®.
That is, to avoid the restrictive State branching
laws that prevented C&S from competing.
The only response the Department produces to fill the
void of any legal mandate for C&S to compete with its own

63
associates consists of cases holding, first, that the
corporate relationships are not determinative of the applica~
bility of the Act — that suits us -- or, second, vrhere
corporately related entities combine to enter into express
agreements to commit naked per se violations of the Sherman
Act by fixing prices and allocate territories and markets,
while holding themselves out to be competitors with one
another, they will not be allowed to defend behind t-e veil
of corporate separateness,,
It would not well serve antitrust principles to leap
from authorities which condemn flagrant and clear violations
which were defended only by a plea of common ownership -that was the only defense —* to a condemnation of the entirely
beneficial and procompetitive associations of this case,
because the entities are separate in form.
The Department asked this Court to pronounce an
unreasonable commitment to form over substance, an area
traditionally devoted to substance over form,

A totally

novel doctrine that would require one company and its d©
facto subsidiaries, held out to the public to be a subsidiary,
with the same name, aggressively to compete with one another.
Is it being asked to beat its little protogee's
%

brains out with vigorous competition?

Confusing the public,

delighting the competition, and ana sing them somewhat,
infuriating the regulators who had depended upon C&S to furnish

64
this servies, betraying the shareholders, officers, and
employees of the sponsored bank and destroying the bank*
Of what purpose would this sponsorship be under those
circumstances?

What would be left with which ultimately to

merge?
Or should it be supported and competed with at the
same time?
Or should there be, maybe, just a little bit of
competition, enough to keep the wolf from the door?
There is no element of reality in this position.
What rational, expansive-minded but well-managed, bank or
holding company would follow such a course?

How would it ever

develop that this bank could be merged?
4

We urge this Court also to recognise that no flood­
gate of adverse circumstances would occur if this Court
affirms; this plan, this unique plan, no precedent or anything
else would take place,,
Arid, finally, this can't ordinarily happen again»
If someone wants to go this procedure again, they’ve got to
go to the Fed under Section 382, and after making application,
get approval for the formation of subsidiaries, with the
Department notified, who can come in and participate? if they
don't like it, they can file a petition for review to the
nearest circuit court,
Ho floodgates will be opened, only beneficial results

65
will occur hers,

tod this unique little case will tales its

place on the dusty shelves of this Court, and X dare say
never be looked at again.
Thank you, Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

Thank you, Mr. Hodgson*

Mr. Friedman, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M„ FRIEDMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice,

I'd like to just answer two or three -** say two or
three things.
First, we are not of course suggesting that, there
should be any court decree ordering these banks to compete.
All we’re asking is that a court decree stop these restraints
upon competition that have been imposed through this
relationship.
The reason we didn’t challenge

this relationship

in 1968, when the Federal Reserve Board staff had an
investigation, was we didn't know all the facts at that time.
Indeed, Mr. Lane told the Federal Reserve Board hearing that
>

they had always followed the philosophy of influencing but
not controlling these banks.
It wasn’t until we areally began to investigato this
case, after we received notice from the FDIC, that these
applications for merger had been filed, -that we discovered all

66
of the facts.
Nov;, I also want to make it very clear that we have
no objection to the organisation of these banks, to their
assistance in organising those banks.

And, indeed, in the

Marine Bank Corporation case, to which reference has been made,
there our argument was this was a permissible method of a bank
entering into a new market by sponsoring a new bank and
ultimately perhaps acquiring it.
But sponsoring a bank, onjoying a normal correspondent
relationship with it, is a far cry from v;hat GeS has done in
this case.
Now, the argument that's been suggested, that this
whole thing is an exercise in futility, because if we were to
prevail there's no reason to think that the C&S five-percent
banks would disassociate from C&S, things would be continued in
their previous manner? I think the answer to that is if we are
correct in our argument that this arrangement violates the
Sherman Act, steps will have to be taken to terminate this
kind of a relationship*

They are not going to continue in

the same way despite a holding that the arrangement violates
the Sherman Act.
They are undoubtedly going to have to stop using the
name, they're going to have to stop reviewing their loans,
they're going to have to stop having a director sitting as an
advisory man on the board of directors, Thor© are going to be

67
son® changes in the relationship.
And once these changes have taken place , it may well
be that some of these five-percent banks that are so satisfied
with the present relationship may take another look at it,
they may then decide that without this crutch, without this
controlled operation by C&S, maybe they'd be better off in an
independent basis.
Nov/, whatever the reasons there may be for C&S
wanting these banks not to compete, the question was put:
Why on earth would C&S want to stop these banks from
competing?
The fact is, for whatever reason, that’s exactly
what they have done.

They have an arrangement between them

under which the banks don't compete, and they, in effect,
tell the banks how to compete.
This is a — we challenge the basic underlying
arrangement.

You can't segmentise an arrangement eliminating

competition by saying, Well, this memo didn't do it, and
that piece of paper doesn't do it.

I think you've got to

look at the totality of the relationship.
And when you look at the totality of the relationship, I think the fact that the five-percent banks are inde­
pendent banks, that they are not branches of C&S, they were
started originally as independent banks, they have always —
C&S has a lie ays claimed that they are independent banks.

C&S

68
says, We don’t, control these banks? they’re independent banks.
But when you look to see how they behave, in the
light of their understanding with C&S, we see they7ro not
independent banks at all.
were branches.

CsS treats them as though

they

They’re not branches, they’re independent

entities, with independent duties and responsibilities, and
as independent entities they cannot understand and agree with
C&S to eliminate all competiti.on between them.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEP JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Friedman

Thank you, Mr. Hodgson,
The case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted.}
