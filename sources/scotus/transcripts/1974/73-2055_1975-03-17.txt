MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Number 73-2055, Securities Investor Protection
Corporation versus James C. Barbour et al.
I think you may proceed now, Mr. Caron.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILFRED R. CARON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. CARON:

One would think I would be happy to

wait awhile, but in any event, I am sorry for the interrup­
tion.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. CARON:

Not at all.

Go ahead.

May it please the Court, I would

state at the outset that this particular case presents for
review for the first time the

Securities Investment

Protection Act of 1970 which created the Petitioner, the
Securities Investment Protection Corporation.
I will probably slip into certain jargon because
of our familiarity with the Act, so 1 would like to point
out that I will refer to that legislation as the 1970 Act.
I would be referring to the

Petitioner as SIPC,

by which it has come to be called, and I would be referring
to brokers and dealers who are required to be members of
SIPC as — simply as members.
As x 'view the issues in the

,
cq.s©,

the particular

circumstances out of Which these issues arlSQ are not

particularly important or material.
For the purpose of context, however, I would
*r-

summarize them in this fashion:

The controversy does arise

out of a liquidating receivership of a Tennessee brokerdealer and several affiliated companies who are not brokerdealers ,
Soon after the receivership commenced, there was
an order made requiring persons who claimed ownership of
certain securities to make a deposit of five percent of the
principal amount as a reserve to cover administrative expenses
and fees.
Since that time, about 5 percent — three and a
half percent has been returned.
Approximately four months after the commencing
of the receivership, when it had been, in fact, substantially
completed, SIPC was notified by counsel for the receiver that
there appeared to be some risk that those persons who made
those deposits may be exposed to some loss and therefore
requested certain advances of funds in order to make up the
difference.
For various reasons which we felt were good and
sufficient which are not before this Court, after consideration
of the available information and the status of the proceedings,
SIPC determined that it would not be appropriate to intervene
in those circumstances and following that, of course, the

5
receiver five months later commenced a proceeding in the
District Court in Nashville, the object and purpose of
which was to compel SIPC to provide whatever the benefits
are under the ’70 Act to these persons who are still owed
that

one and a half percent deposit.
That is the thrust of the proceeding and it is,

in our Judgment, a proceeding which seeks relief precisely
of the kind which the 1970 Act expressly granted to the
Securities Exchange Commission.
In consequence, the issues which this Court has
agreed to hear and review are these;
Firstly, whether or not members of the Investing
public who are customers of a failed member have a right
to Invoke this extraordinary remedy to review a determina­
tion by SIPC and compel certain mandatory relief and,
Secondly, if, indeed, 3uch a right exists,
can be implied from the

or

statute, whether or not this

receiver has the standing to maintain such an action.
Our position essentially is that the grant to
v/.oe SEC o 1 this extraordinary remedy of enforcement over
SIPC in order to compel it to perform its statutory
responsibilities is clearly an exclusive grant of a very
extraordinary power and an extraordinary remedy.
Our position is that there is nothing in the
legislative history or in the statute itself to suggest to

6
the contrary.
Indeed, our position is that an analysis of the
statute and its purpose and its legislative history would
clearly indicate that Congress, indeed, fashioned and
created a special supervisory tool, placed it in the hands
of the Commission and that it indeed expected that no
member of the general public ^*<Hild simultaneously enjoy
that considerable power.
We depend on the statutory analysis.

We, of

course, look to certain maxims of construction but in my
opinion, to the extent we look to the principles of
construction, they are only really assistance to what I
would regard as an ineluctable conclusion.
Because the job of analysis is far better done
in writing and in briefs, I would not attempt to detail too
much the contents of the brief we filed.

I would like,

however, to focus on three aspects of the statute which I
consider to be most helpful and most critical.
Firstly, I would like to mention briefly the
purpose of the legislation.

It was enacted effective

December, 19/0 In the wake of a considerable number of
broker-dealer failures in the bad years of 1967, 8 and 9, *70.
The thrust and purpose was to bolster investor
confidence in the securities markets and by this 1970 Act,
Congress actacked the problem in a number of v?ays.

Some

7
were affirmative and some were negative.
It certainly enhanced the Commission's power
to promulgate and enforce financial responsibility roles
for

brokers and dealers, gave the Commission the power to

impose on self-regulatory organizations the duty to adopt
additional rules of that kind.
It looked to the improvement of the examination
and inspection procedures for the self-regulatory organiza­
tions to assure compliance with rules affecting financial
responsibility and to detect as early as possible approach­
ing financial difficulties.
It directed the Commission to conduct a study of
unsafe and unsound practices, which it did and finally,
part and parcel of this attack on the problem of Investor
confidence, it did create SIPC.
It created it as a non-industry —

or, rather,

a nonprofit industry-funded membership corporation.

It

provided specifically it would not be a government agency.
It created it so that in the event these attempts to avoid
failures were not successful in certain cases, public
confidence could be bolstered by the notion that there is an
organization, after all, which stands behind the failure
of that type with its fund3.
They created an organization funded by the
industry with only the possibility of a call on federal

money and they created a corporation with a board of
directors which is prescribed by statute — a responsible
one in my opinion — a balanced one.
dominance.

There is not federal

There is not industry dominance.

There is not

public dominance.
They are men of considerable reputation and the
brief will indicate how they are selected.
The second point that I would like to emphasize
is the means by which public customers are protected when
brokers and dealers do fail who are members of SIPC.
There is a dependence on the' part of SIPC

on the

information and cooperation of the self-regulatory organiza­
tions and the SEC.
They are the ones with the examining authority.
They are the ones who receive the reports.

We do not.

However, under our statute, they have the
obligation,when they learn of facts that leave them to believe
that perhaps a firm is approaching difficulty, to report
those facts to us and as that is done, if the situation
• appears to warrant the critical analysis on the basis of
the available facts, we do that and we look to our statute
which authorizes us to do the following:
If one of five statutory conditions exists — end
they are' spelled out in the statute, for example, Insolvency,
to some extent, noncompliance with applicable regulations of

9
the

Commission and if the firm has failed or is in danger

of failing to meet its obligations to customers, SIPC is
vested with the discretion to

make an application to the

District Court in the appropriate jurisdiction seeking an
adjudication that customers require protection, seeking the
appointment of a trustee in .liquidation and thereby provid­
ing the protection contemplated by the statute.
It is not a ministerial act thht the statute
talks about.

It doesn't amount to a Congressional direction

that it doesn't so exist, you must, but allows some flexi­
bility, the parameters of which I don't think are involved
today and have not been determined in any event.
The proceeding that is brought is essentially
an involuntary bankruptcy proceedings.
The statuto expands on the powers of a court of
bankruptcy by allowing certain Chapter X powers and pro­
visions to become operative through an Incorporation by
reference but essentially, reorganization is prohibited.
It is truly a straight involuntary bankruptcy
proceeding based to some extent insofar as customers'
substantive rights are concerned on Section 60-E of the
Bankruptcy Act and I don't feel it is appropriate to get into
that detail at the moment.
I think what is really new about this particular
proceedings — at least, two of the more important aspects.

10

would be this:
Because the Congress was concerned about a possible
domino effect on the industry by the failure of one firm,
the
it did authorize / completion of open contractual commitments
between the firm in liquidation and another broker-dealer.
More Important and most germane here, by the
statute, the funds of the member in liquidation, you state,
is no longer the only source from which a customer's claim
in bankruptcy may be satisfied.
Under this statute, civic fund3 now, under certain
prescribed limits, will augment the estate.
There is, if

you will, a method of collection

but insofar as substantive rights are concerned, not that
much difference between Section 60 of the Bankruptcy Act and
our statute.

There are differences, however.

So this is the proceeding; this is the relief
i

that it is alleged and claimed here by Receiver SIPC should,
by reason of its obligations, have initiated and commenced.
The third aspect I would look to on oral argument
is the Commission’s supervision under the statute.

In some

respects, the SEC is a —

Thank you very much, Mr. Chief
