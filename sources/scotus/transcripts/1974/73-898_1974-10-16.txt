ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS A. BUSTIN, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

MR. BUSTIN;

This case originates as a direct appeal from the
decision of a three-judge district court in Ohio.
During the early months of 1971 in the Columbus

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

§

1©

We will hear arguments

School District in Columbus, Ohio, several of the schools
located in that district experienced a series of internal
student disruptions of the type involving fighting among
students, blocking of hallways and stairways, questions
surrounding the setting of several fires in one of the school
buildings.

One of the schools had to be closed for a period of

time trying to bring order back.

Open defiance of the type

S@
characterized when a principal was speaking to one of the
19

- .**•

assembled classes and one of the students got up and told the
20

principal that they were all done listening to him, that he
31

would now listen to them, and they were going to tell him how
22

23
24

21

i ■■

it was going to be run.
From that pattern of internal disruption there
occurred a series of temporary suspensions anywhere from five

l

a.

3

4
i

to ten days? arising under a statute, Section 3313.66 of the

2

Ohio Revised Code, which allowed a principal to temporarily

3

suspend for a period of one to ten days without holding a

4

formal hearing.
The statute required the principal or administrative

official to send a notification to the parents and to the
school department of the fact of the suspension.

also contained a provision which, in the case of expulsion,
required that the parents, when expulsion was going to take
place, could appeal that action to the board of education,
and the question of whether or not the child should be
expelled would be heard by the Columbus Board of Education.
Following this pattern of temporary suspensions, a

1983 civil rights action was instituted in which the section

I have just discussed was challenged as being unconstitutional,
in violation of the 14th Amendment Due Process Clause, and it
was also alleged that it was vague and over-broad in its
provisions.
Following the conclusion of a trial, the three-judge

18

district court concluded in its opinion that the statutory

section and the regulations implementing the statute in the

In Ohio in the structuring the school system, the

2

Ohio constitution directs that the legislature is to use

3

public funds to establish a common system of schools and also

gives the legislature power in the area of organization,

administration, and control of that particular school system
that is set up.

And this particular statute, as I mentioned,

is one of that series of statutory schemes that sets up and
controls the common system of the schools in Ohio.
It is appellants’ position in this particular case
in analyzing what is involved and in discussing the interest
of the school that what is really involved in this whole case
is not really the temporary suspensions themselves but really
a question of what power the states and local school districts
will have to structure their particular school systems.

When

I use the term "structure", I mean make decisions with respect

!

to not only how the process will go on, who will be the

iteachers, but how it will be managed and what form of academic |

discipline will be utilllized in the particular system.

I

than you find in other common areas--and I say that from

4

this standpoint—when you are trying to structure a school

system, a very important question is the type of relationship

the state and, to carry it down further, the local school

i

districts would like to see established in their particular

§

Q

I©

By that you mean between the teachers and the

students, I assume.
11

MR. BUSTIN:

12

Yes.

I mean the type of relationship

that will exist in the ongoing process between the teacher,

13

the student, and the principal.

n

Q

15

Members of the school board, for example,

do not have anything directly to do with the students day by

day, do they?
17

MR. BUSTIN:

Not on a day-by-day basis.

But I think \

10

\

this all works into the very process of formulatincr what type
is

i

of academic discipline is going to take place in the particular
20
school.

Viewed in that context, I think the states must
22
retain a certain degree of discretion, if you will, to
5

23
decide for themselves whether or not they will have academic

discipline and what the form of that academic discipline will

7

be.

It is our position that based on a much similar analogy

I
as was contained in the Linwood case, a legislature that
2

legislates as it has done in this particular case, which is
3

in a restrictive sense, restricting the authority of the
4

principal really from having what I would class as a carte
5

6

to a period from one to ten days without requiring a hearing
7

while at the same time requiring one or utilizing one where

daily management of their particular internal affairs of the

MR. BUSTIN:

If the court said—from the standpoint

that the court did not-Q

Was there not an injunction requiring the

cancellation of the records, of the suspension records?
MR. BUSTIN:

The court required us to expunge

from the records—
Q

Is that not an injunction?

You lost on that,

did you not?
MR. BUSTIN:

Yes, that is what I was getting to.

Apart from finding the statute invalid, the court directed
us to expunge from the records of the pupils involved in this
particular class action—
Q

That is an injunction, however it was labeled,

is it not?
MR. BUSTIN:

What I was trying to say was that the

court did not specifically label it an injunction.

But they

did require us to expunge from the records of these people
involved in this class action.
Q

Did the Court require the school to adopt this

system that they outlined?
MR. BUSTIN:

Yes, they set up the system that they

found would be a proper type of system to utilize where a
tenporary suspension was going to take place.
Q

A little while ago you stated flatly, I thought

that no injunction was issued, that no injunction was denied.

You have to take this position to be here.

the principals involved.

next to the last paragraph is:

Q

For the purpose of our jurisdiction.

21
MR. BUSTIN:

For the purposes of your jurisdiction.

d»d-

Q

By inference, the court has restricted the

23

freedom of the school district to handle suspensions the way
24
they formerly handled them by imposing affirmative
m

il
requirements .

|

MR. BUSTIN:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, the district

I

court set up a formula, if you will, of how we were supposed
to handle temporary suspensions, saying in part that we
could temporarily suspend without a hearing for a period of
three days.

But after that, we had a procedure that we had to

go through.

1

So, in that sense they did restrict—I think place
a restriction on this relationship that I am talking about,
that I think the Columbus school district sought to foster
in its system, and that is one of discipline being part and

2

parcel of the educational process.
Q

Mr. Bustin, would you tell us a little bit

about the purpose for which these records are maintained.

Are

they made available, for example, to some future potential
employer, or are they maintained only for internal use of the
school system?
MR. BUSTIN;

In the record of this cause, in the

deposition of the superintendent of schools that was taken,
it was explained that these records are not made generally
available to everyone and that when an employer calls in, for
example, and wants information about the student, he is given
basic information pertaining to his grades and whether or not
he graduated from the school.
for ready examination.

But the records are not open

l
t

12

It was also explained in the testimony of the

3

superintendent that the focus of the information they try to

3

provide was graduation and grades and also tests, where they

4

have taken psychological tests and things of that nature.
Q

Suppose the people had been suspended for, say,

three days when he was a freshman in high school and he later

7

applied to a college and his high school transcript was sent

grades from the schooling process and all grades in

Q

Does that appear in the appendix?

Yes, it appears in the appendix, the

testimony of Superintendent Ellis.

mathematics, for example, as he is by—
Q

What experience do you have in evaluating school

records?
MR. BUSTIN:

I have no individual experience.

Q

I did not think so.

Q

Is there anything in the court's opinion that

says yea or nay about what may be done with the transcript of
the student's record now under the holding of the three-judge
court?
MR. BUSTIN:

No, Your Honor.

The three-judge court,

all they did was require us or mandate us to expunge these
references to the disciplinary transfers and suspensions from
their records.
Q

But the school may suspend for three days

without a hearing in the future?
MR.BUSTIN:
Q

That is right.

And if that is placed on the record, it will go

in whatever manner it has previously gone; is that a fair
assumption?
MR. BUSTIN:

If, as Mr. Justice Marshall said, the

That would be expulsion.

MR. BUSTIN:

Is expulsion defined anywhere?

Expulsion is not defined as a definition j:

in the code that sets up the kind of school system.

15

Q

53

I suppose you could have expulsion for 20 days,

could you?
MR. BUSTIN:

I think a legislature could categorise

expulsion.
19

Q

It has not defined expulsion at all, has it?

MR. BUSTIN:

That I can find in this particular--

21

Q

How do you understand the meaning of the word

21

"expulsion"?
24 ||
•»

£3 S

Does it mean permanently out of school forever?

MR. BUSTIN:

I

Even in the sense of the Ohio situation,

I don't even think they view expulsion as being permanently

18

out of the school forever.
Q

Stoat does it mean?

MR. BUSTIN:

Because the way the statute reads, it

is a removal from the school for the remainder of the school
term, which may even be 30 days.
Q

Has there been any annotations on this

discussion?
MR. BUSTIN:

I have searched high and wide and been

unable to find any Ohio cases which have directly taken up this
particular statute.

And the closest thing I could cane to it in

any sense was a case in State ex rel. Fleetwood in 20 Ohio
Appellate 2nd.

But that was not to the constitutional nature

of the statute itself.

It just has not been treated in that

context by Ohio courts.
Q

Would it be correct or incorrect to say that

the difference between the three™judge federal court and the
Ohio statute is the difference between ten days and three days
on this suspension?
MR. BUSTIN:

They seem to be going off, as I view it— j

the only way I can view it in a difference between three and
ten days, they seem to make three days okay and the period of
ten days as violating due process.
Q

Would you make the same argument if it were a

hundred?

Were a hundred?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER D. ROOS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
5 •:

MR. ROOS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I think that a misunderstanding of the lowex* court's
opinion has developed in the questioning of Mr. Bustin.

I

think that a close reading of that opinion would show that
what the court did was say that a prior hearing is required
whenever there is a suspension, except when there is an
emergency situation.

And when there is an emergency situation,

the school district can suspend a student for up to 72 hours
but must provide a subsequent hearing.
This was the position that was urged by us at the
lower court, and we believe that this is the gist of the
decision of the lower court, and this in fact is the common

T

20
I

accommodation in plans that are voluntarily adopted.
Q

2
3

4

In other words , you do not .read the opinion to

say that a suspension without a hearing for three days is
i
i

constitutionally valid?
MR. ROOS:

3

That is correct, Your Honor.

The court

6

did not engage in the line drawing that seemed to appear in

7

Mr. Rustin’s argument.

8

as required, but there may be circumstances when there is

§

intense disruption of the school or when the student is a

i
I
\

It was really rather a prior hearing

i

m

danger to himself or to others, that would justify doing away

I1
|
i
.

.i

\

with the prior hearing.

But in that instance, a hearing must

1
I

be provided within 72 hours thereafter.
Q

13

But that means that the discretion in the first

14

instance rests with the principal under this opinion for

as

7 2 hours.

16

MR. ROOS:
Q

That is correct, Your Honor.

;'

What if we decided to slice it a little different |y

17
a®

and say six days, not ten days as the statute prescribed, not
three as the District Court, but six?

Do you think there would!

be any basis for that?
MR. ROOS:

Your Honor, as I understand the lower

■

court’s opinion—and this would be certainly the position that '
we would urge--it is not saying that a principal has absolute
'

discretion to suspend a student for three days.

What it is

saying is that there may be emergency situations which may

I

29

2

justify doing away ttfifch the prior hearing.

2

that a principal has an absolute carte blanche to throw a kid

out.

MR. ROOS:

great reliance upon the good faith of school administrators.
At some point or other, it does boil down to that.
I might add, however, that various other school systems

10

Who is going to determine that, when, and with

what consequences?

It is not saying

that have voluntarily adopted plans have built in mechanisms
for assuring that this is not a massive loophole.
For example, we are informed that in Seattle, for
i
example, that at the subsequent hearing—-there is a hearing

.

J

ultimately-—at the subsequent hearing one of the issues might,

t

be whether the emergency suspension procedure was properly
f
.. < J
utilized. There are institutional mechanisms for assuring thaspg

it

this loophole, if you will, just does not open the gates to
£
absolute discretion, but ultimately some confidence has to be

accorded to the principal in the belief that they will not make j

of this emergency situation a giant loophole and call every

suspension an emergency.

MR. ROOS:

Your Honor, it is generally our position

Q

Mr. Roos, do you claim it is a denial of a

property interest or a liberty interest that your clinets are
going to suffer.
MR. ROOS:

Your Honor, it is our position that botPi a

property interest and a liberty interest are implicated.
Under this Court's rulings in Roth, Cinderman, Dow v. Person,
the statutory entitlement cases, this Court has held that a

continue in this school system?
MR. ROOS:

Under this Court's decision, Your Honor,

I do not see how there can be any question of that.
Q

Why did not the teacher in Roth then have a

property interest to continue as a teacher?
MR. ROOS:

As

I understand it, Your Honor, in

Roth the sense was if the teacher had had tenure under state
law, if there had in fact been a statutory entitlement to
continue in employment or something other than a statutory
entitlement,an understanding as in Cinderman, then there would
have been a protected interest.

And if there had been an

20

And we were talking about
As a practical matter,

Your Honor, I have had quite a good deal of experience in

21

analyzing statistics and whatnot on suspensions and expulsions.

22

As a practical matter, they very rarely occur at the elementary

2S

24

2$

1

school level.

It is primarily at the

junior high and high

school level.

But they could occur and under our analysis

35
there would be no particular reason that we could think of for
distinguishing between an elementary school system and a high
school system.
Q

May I ask you this;

Is it your view that or

does the record support the view that a one-day suspension of a
sixth grade child would adversely the affect the performance
of that child in that grade?
MR. RODS:

Your Honor, the record does support that

it could adversely affect a child.
Q

Is that somebody's speculation, or is there

any demonstration of it?
MR. ROOS:

There is ample, uncontroverted testimony

of the sorts of harms that can and do occur in a suspension.
Q

For one day?

MR. ROOS:

•ft

Any suspension, Your Honor.

I would draw

this Court's attention especially to the testimony of Dr. Rie,
which starts at page 171.
Q

It is not long.

It runs to 182.

Volume 2?

MR. ROOS;

41

Yes, Volume 2 of the appendix.

The harms that he describes and which are uncontroverted all could occur or are substantially likely to occur
to any child, irrespective of age and irrespective of length.
It is true clearly that the longer an exclusion,
the likelihood of harm or the magnitude of the harm may
increase.

We woulk not argue that that is not the case.

Ic
If

But

j
36

1

we do argue and argue forcefully that even a short-term

2

suspension can have stigmatizing consequences, can have

3

educational consequences, and what not.
Q

4

Are there not a good many areas in which

5

peremptory .reaction is allowed which involve stigmatizing and

MR. ROOS:

There may be some situations of that sort

But we would submit that there is no reason whatsoever,

there is no reason advanced by our opponents and there is no

25

reason that we can conjure up for not holding some form of

I

protection to insure that the sorts of alarms that we have
set out in our brief and which are well documented in the
record will not occur.
Q

What about the adverse effects on the other

students and their rights to a quiet classroom, to orderly
procedures, to all the things that teachers and parents
desire?
MR. ROOS:

No question, Your Honor, that we believe

a disruptive classroom is not a desirable situation.

That is

why we urge the lower court to adopt the emergency suspension

!©

procedurej absent the sort of emergency that is provided for
by the lower court decision and which is commonly provided for
and adopted in regulations that are voluntarily adopted, the
sort of disruption that you envision is taken care of.

14

So that

what we are dealing with, the sorts of situations that are not

15

emergencies, that are not in some way interfering substantially
with the rights of other students or with the learning process.

17

Q

Your position is that the Constitution compels

every school board to adopt this sort of procedure.
MR. ROOS:

That is correct, Your Honor.

We believe

that there is certainly in Ohio a property interest.
would appear to be a liberty interest involved.

There

There in fact

may even be a liberty interest under the rule of Constantineau

consequences that can occur in a suspension, even a short-term
