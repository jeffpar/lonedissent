MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER j

We will hear arguments

next in 74-114, United States against Brignoni-Ponce.
Before we proceed with your case, Mr. Frey, 1' want
to remedy an oversight.

I did not — I overlooked thanking

fir. Shapery for his assistance to the Court and his client,
because you, too, acted at the request of the Court and by
the appointment of the Court.
Mr. Frey, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ., OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FREY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court s
This case is here on the government's petition to
review the judgment of the Court of Appeals for tine Ninth
Circuit, reversing respondent's conviction for transporting
aliens who were present in this country illegally.
The reversal was predicated on the ground that, the
stop of respondent’s car and the ensuing inquiry as to the
nationality of its occupants violated the Fourth Amendment.
And that testimony at trial of the aliens who were being
transported by respondent was the fruit of the poisonous
tree, and that their testimony should have been suppressed.
Respondent vas arrested on the evening of March 11,
1973, by two Border Patrol officers who were on duty in a

4
patrol car stationed at the San Clemente checkpoint.

The

checkpoint was closed at the time, due to inclement v/eather,
the patrol car was parked at right angles to the highway with
its headlights directed toward the highway in such a fashion
that it could ~~ would illuminate the passing cars.
The officers observed respondent's car pass by, •
containing respondent and two passengers, all of whom appeared
to be of Mexican descent.

They pursued and stepped the vehicle

for what they characterized at the suppression hearing as a
routine immigration inspection.
QUESTION:

Mr. Frey, do they close these checkpoints

whenever the v/eather is bad?
MR. FREY:

They close them for various reasons.

There is a concern about the effect of the checkpoint operation
on the flow of traffic# and at times when traffic is heavy,
for instance on Sunday afternoon, they will normally feel
compelled to close the checkpoint down because it’s interfering
too much with the normal flow of traffic,
QUESTION: Well, it's meant to interfere with traffic,
isn't it?

That's its purpose.
MR. FREY:

Well, the —

QUESTION:

"Just wait till Sunday".

MR. FREY:

The border patrol ~~ well, that is a

problem# and in our Reply Brief in" Ortiz, I have a footnote
which indicates what happened when one Sunday, quite unexpectedly,

5
they kept the checkpoint open, and they caught exceptionally
large numbers of illegal entrants on that occasion.
QUESTION:

But nobody got home till Monday

morning.
MR. FREY:

Well, it is a problem, and the Border

Patrol believes that it is its responsibility to attempt to
balance its interest in apprehending aliens with the interest
of motorists on the highway to proceed without a two-hour
traffic jam.

We try to avoid that kind of an imposition on

the traffic.
Now, of course, it does -- there are holes in the
system.

It is possible for a skilled, knowledgeable smuggler

— and many of the alien smugglers are highly sophisticated;
they have drop houses near the border, they have scouts who
go ahead and phone back, and so on.

It is possible to evade

the system; the net is not airtight.
QUESTION:

Well, in some prior case, Mr. Frey, I

don’t recall which one -- not Almeida-Sanchaz; something
before that — there was reference to an occasion when this
strict border search that Mr. Justice White alluded to was
enforced for some period of time, resulted in diplomatic
representations by the Mexican Government to the State
Department of the United States «—
MR. FREY:
QUESTION:

I’m afraid I'm not familiar with that.
Was that in a case — you're not

6
familiar with the case?
MR. FREY;

No, I'm not„

I would say, though, that even at tie border, the
question of how closely they search people’s bags, how many
people, what proportion of the entrants arriving at a Port of
Entry are searched, at Dulles Airport or something, will
depend on the volume of people*

If there’s three 74'7ss just

coming in with a large number of people, the checking is
going to be somewhat more cursory, more people will, probably
be passed through by Customs without a careful search of
their baggage*
These are accommodations to the exigencies of the
situation®
In any event, in this case, they questioned the
passengers in English, which they appeared not to understand,
and then in Spanish, concerning their citizenship? and they
discovered that the passengers had no papers authorizing them
to be in the United States®
Respondent and the passengers were then arrested*
The suppression hearing took place prior to this
Court’s decision in Almeida-Sanchez, and there was a quite
cursory exploration of the circumstances surrounding the stop*
QUESTION:

Suppression of what?

MR. FREY;

Well, there was a motion made by

respondent to suppress testimony of the aliens, as tine fruit

7
of an illegal search.
At the tine it was, I think, quite clear to every­
body under Ninth Circuit law then that that notion had no
hope of prevailing at that tine? and, as I say, I think it was
actually held on the day of trial and denied.
The only inquiry into the particular reason for
selecting respondent's car for a stop was made in the form of
a couple of leading questions, asking on cross-examination by
respondent's counsel.
Now, on appeal, the Court of Appeals first considered
the question of whether this was a roving patrol or a
checkpoint stop, and decided that it was more properly
characterized as a roving patrol? and we haven't challenged
that characterization here.
That the site of the roving patrol stops are
invalid in the absence of a warrant for particularised
foun de d s us pi ci on.
I don't chirk it's — it didn't suggest that a warrant
would do, but in this case, of course, there was no warrant.
It considered tills conclusion to flow from the
decision of this Court in Alrcsida-Sanchez, and from this
Court's reliance on Carroll, which, I point out that Carroll
is square with Almeida-Sanehez in the sense that if Carroll
involved a roving patrol search, the other cases we have
here are not — are distinguishable from Carroll? one on the
t

8
basis that they involve checkpoints which we say are different,
and in 'this case that we are not seeking here the authority
to search but simply to stop. And Carroll was not concerned
with a pure stop, but, rather, with a search of Mr. Carroll's
car.
We submit that there is a substantial constitutionally
significant difference between a search of an automobile and
a stop for the purpose of briefly interrogating its occupants
regarding their right to be in the United States»

And that

with respect, to stops within a reasonable distance of the
Mexican border, this Court should honor the congressional
judgment that warrantless stops for this limited purpose are
reasonable and proper to help enforce vitally important
congressional policy to limit the influx of aliens for
residence in the United States.
QUESTION:

Let’s see if I follow you there, Mr, Fatey,

In other words, if this were in Chicago, you
wouldn't ba before us?
MR. FREY:

I thought you said
Well, to look at the circumstances, we

would not “«* we do not assert a right to stop cars on a
random basis or without particularized suspicion in Chicago»
There is an issue, if we believe that a car contained
an alien or if we believed that a pedestrian was an alien,
subsection (1) of the statute appears to confer a right to
interrogate that person.

9

I basically rely in this case on subsection (3)
rather than on subsection (1) of section 237.
relying on the

That is, I’m

I am contending that the stop-ancl-question

authority is necessarily encompassed within the authority
that Congress conferred to boardsand-search.
And that, although to the extent that it purported
to give that authority to search on roving patrols, in
AImeida~Sanchez this Court held it invalid, we think that the
lesser authority at stake in stopping and interrogating is
constitutionally permissible, and that the statute should be
upheld in that regard.
WOW,

I

QUESTION;
(3)?

You say you rely primarily on (1) or on

I miseed that.
MR. FREY;

Primarily on (3), v/ithin the border area.

In other words, our position is that we have a superior or
greater right to stop and interrogate within a reasonable
distance of the border than we would have outside a reasonable
distance of the border.
I think we've triad to make it clear in our brief
that we are not saying that we could set up a checkpoint on
the road between Omaha and Des Moines and do the same thing,
QUESTION;

Well, ara I not right in remembering that

Terry v. Ohio said, in passing on that, opinion, that anv
policeman can interrogate anybody about anything at any time?

10

Constitutionally.
MR- FREY:

That's true# but we have here snore than

a simple interrogation.

In order to get to interrogate

respondent, we had to stop his automobile.
QUESTION: Well, if he were a pedestrian —
ME. FREYs

If he were a pedestrian, I think there

would be a basis for arguing that you could go up to him and
simply say:

I'm an officer of the Immigration Service and I —

QUESTION;

And, "Did you see a man go by hers in a

white hat?" or something,
MR- FREY:

Indeed, or "Are you a citizen of the

United States?"
QUESTION:

Or "Are you a citizen of -the United

QUESTION;

But if you want to do more than that,

States?"

Terry
and those cases would indicate that if a person says,
.mnmtnmn
i*»r

"Nona of your business, go on", just if it's just an citizen
and it's without reasonable suspicion, they couldn't hold aperson.
You're suggesting you could not only stop them but
you could hold them until you asked the questions?
MR. FREY:

That’s correct.

When I get into the legal portion of the argument,
we're suggesting —
QUESTION:

And in Terry, if there were reasonable

11
suspicion,, the officer supposedly could hold them until he
finished his questions.
MR. PREY:

That’s true.

Nowi of course, respondent says -QUESTION:

But just with any other citizen, no.

QUESTION: That’s right.
MR. FREY:

Well, if there were no *»- I don’t believe,

that a police officer could forcibly detain just any person.
QUESTION:

So you’re saying that because you’re

within a reasonable distance of the border, you do have
greater power to stop and interrogate than just with any
citisen on the street?
MR, PREY:

Absolutely.

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. FREY:

Absolutely.

And I think the statute

makes that distinction, and we rely on (3),
There is an argument about what subsection (1) means,
because subsection (1) talks about a belief that the person
is an. alien? subsection (3) requires no belief of that sort.
I think it would be debatable as to whether we would
have the authority, under subsection (1) , to forcibly detain,
somebody within 'the border area, within a hundred miles,
without a belief that hevas an alien.

There would be some

problems under the language of the statute.
QUESTION:

And where does (3) give you the power to

12
forcibly detain somebody?
MR. PREYs

Well,

(3) gives ns the power to stop-and-

search , as we construe it.
QUESTION :

To' board-, andtsearch?

MR, PREY:

To board-and*’gearch.

QUESTION;

Any vessel.

MR. PREY;

Well —

And any railway car, aircraft, conveyance

or vehicle.
MR. FREY;

Well, '’vehicle”, in -this case we're -«■

QUESTION:

"Board and search".

I’d thought, rather,

that that was referring to the practice, it used to be, when
people traveled by ship rather than by airplane or —
MR. FREY;

There is —•

QUESTION;

— going out beyond Ambrose Light — out

to Ambrose Light, and the Customs officials boarding a vessel
out there, beyond our borders.
MR, PREY;

Well, the statute is derived from

authority at the border with respect to stopped vehicles;
but I think it's entirely clear, from an examination of the
history of the statute, that this was intended to confer the
power to stop a moving automobile, and that was not doubted in
Almeida-Ua:nche_z.

And I think it's quite clear that the

statute already contained the language "board and search" in
1946.

What Congress did was it removed from the statute the

13
requirenent that there be a belief that the person be an
alien, and it introduced into the statute the right to make
this search within a reasonable distance of the border and
not simply at the border»
And I think if the Court looks at what Congress did
in 1946, X don't think there's any serious question that
Congress intended to confer this power.
confer the power to search.

It intended to

We say this is necessarily

included within the power to search is the power to stop.
QUESTION:

Well* within the border area that you

think this special rule applies

„

are you urging -that you must

have power randomly to stop, or do you say — or do you say
it's only when an Immigration officer, a Border Patrol officer
believes there's something suspicious?
MR* FREY:

No, we say that we have the power to

stop randomly.
I would like to make a point in connection with
Terry

,

—
QUESTION:

Is that —

MR. FREY:

— we say we have the power to stop —-

QUESTION: Randomly?
MR, FREYs

and interrogate randomly,

QUESTION: Randomly, as a deterrent tool,
MR. FREY: As both a deterrent and an affirmation
tool

14
QUESTION:

Which makes irrelevant in this case that

they thought — these looked like Mexicans, they thought there
were Mexicans, or anything else?
MR. FREY;

I think it’s -■ I think it’s completely

irrelevant.
Now, I can picture a case in which the individual
stop was, let us say, a 60-year-aId lady who was alone in her
car and who was clearly Anglo-Saxon, and her car was stopped
stimply for the purpose of asking her about her citizenship.
QUESTION;
MR. FREY3

Or if you stop a motorcycle?
Well, no, I’m not talking about search

authority now, I’m just talking about stopping arid asking the
person in the car what their citizenship is. And such a
person might be able to argue that, while it’s true that you
ought to have random power, —
QUESTION; She might be no more than
MR. FREY;

-— it's hardly reasonable to stop me,

— because she might be; that's true.

But of course the

conditions in the Mexican border area that justify the power
that we are asserting here and that we say make this case
distinguishable from Terry * s articulated, particularized
suspicion at that point; is it applicable to Mexicans?
QUESTION:

Would you say it's ~~ is it in this area,

within a reasonable distance of the border, there' is the
generalized justification to make random searches of anybody

15
that is equivalent to the particularized justification that
the Court found in Terry?
MR, FREY:
QUESTION:
MR. FREY:

That’s correct.
Is that it?
That’s correct.

QUESTION: Because of its proximity to the border,
this now becomes generalized to support a random search of
anybody.
MR. FREY:

Because of the particular conditions that

exist at the Mexican border.
QUESTION:

But it's the equivalent of the

particularized contra-suspicion ~~
MR. FREY:

It's the equivalent of --

QUESTION:

-- with respect to Mr. Terry on the

street of Cleveland, Ohio?
MR, FREY:

That's correct.

In the case of Mr* Terry, it was obviously
necessary for the Court to require specific facts relating to
Mr, Terry, because otherwise you would have a rule that would
leave the police at liberty, any place in the country, to
forcibly detain anybody with no reason at all.
Now, here we're saying there's a substitute,
QUESTION: Well, would another analogy be, say, in
the San Diego area, if the police were making a license check
for automobile licenses, or for driver licenses?

16

MR. FREY:

We think this is quite analogous to it,

to a driver's license check, although we think that the showing
of ’ihe constitutional equivalent of probable cause that we can
show here is far greater than any that cam be shown to justify
stopping people for a license check.

Because we think that

what's at stake here is literally the problem of ■—
QUESTION:

But you wouldn't say that in some other

city, Memphis, Tennessee, or something, that you could just
stop anybody and forcibly detain them while you inquired about
his citizenship?
MR. FREY;

No, we're not asserting the authority to

stop anybody in Memphis, Tennessee, and forcibly detain them.
Unless there might be circumstances
QUESTION5 But you are in Southern California, —*
MR. FREY:

You are in Southern California.

QUESTION:

— to forcibly detain them until you

ascertain whether they're citizens or not?
MR. FREY:

We are asserting that.

QUESTION:

I mean for a brief time, anyway.

MR. FREY: For a brief time.

We consider it

I mean,

to call it a forcible detention for most people who drive
along the highway, it's a question of stopping the car, the
officer comes over, and he says, you know, "What is your
citizenship?

are you an American citizen?"

QUESTION:

Well, if you're last in line of a. hundred

17
cars, then, and you're in a hurry to get horae on Sunday
night, that’s quite a while.
MR. FREYi

That’s one of the reasons why the

Border Patrol is sensitiva to those concerns, and closes the
checkpoint.

So that it does, it avoids the situation in which

you have a hundred cars backed up.
The "way the San Clemente checkpoint operates, it
does not stop every car.

The figure of 99.9 percent that was

given to you in the last argument with respect to the number
of aliens that are apprehended is a terribly misleading
figure, because what was done there1

was to compare the total

flow of traffic across the road with the number of aliens
who were caught.
But the vast bulk of the traffic is not stopped.
We do not stop every car.

On a highway like at San Clemente,

where the traffic is extremely heavy, a very small proportion
are stopped.
Now, of course, many are required to slow down as
they go by the checkpoint. That is an inconvenience.

We think

that idi® Constitution does not prohibit our subjecting people
to that kind of inconvenience to serve the vital objective
that this program is designed to serve.
Now, I think it’s important to —
QUESTION;

Before you go on with that, let me see

if I can track your argument on applying the Terry stop

18

principles to this situation.

You say that within a reasonable

distance of the border the officers may stop any car for any
reason, just to ask them questions?
MR. FREY;

Without any particular reason.

QUESTION;

Without a particular reason.

MR. FREY s

Yes .

QUESTION; Without probable cause, certainly.
MR. FREY;
QUESTION;

Or even founded suspicion; right.
Yes.

Nov? then, when it develops at that

point that the occupants of the car, or some of them, cannot
speak English, are you suggesting that a probable cause then
comes into being?
MR. FREY;

I til ink, Mr. Chief Justice, -that there

is no serious dispute on that.

That is, if we’re entitled to

if we were entitled to stop respondent’s car, I don’t
think there's any serious challenge that once they shrug
their shoulders and didn’t speak English, we had, in effect,
probable cause for the ensuing arrest.
The focus of this case is on whether we could stop
this car in the first place and get to ask the question; and
of course, if we can’t stop this car, then we have no way of
interdicting the flow through, in our view.
QUESTION; Well, taking that step by step, you wouldn't
claim the same right in Des Moines, Iowa, necessarily?
MR. FREY;

No, we wouldn't, unless there were special

.19

conditions, that I don’t think exist in Das Moines, Iowa.
QUESTION:

You're saying that probable cause arises

from the inability of these people to speak English, because
they are in close proximity to the Mexican border?
MR. PREY :

Well, no, but —

well, let me make a

distinction, Mr. Chief Justice, there are the distinctions
that are constitutionally pertinent and those that are made
by the statute.
The statute makes a distinction between the area
within a hundred miles of the border and the rest of the
country.

The interrogation authority that the statute

confers, which is nationwide, is restricted to persons who are
believed to be aliens.
Now, from the constitutional standpoint, the Court
asks us:

What is our justification for impeding people in

going about their business, for making them stop their cars
and roll down their windows and answer a question?
And we are saying that in this case, in this group ■
of cases, the constitutional justification is that there
are special problems in the area of the Mexican border? that
these problems are enormous? that the traffic check operations
are vital to our system of stopping the inflow of illegal
entrants from Mexico into the interior labor markets»
That is our constitutional justification, and we
rely on Camara, together with Terry.

We rely on Camara

20

for the portion that says we don't need special-focus probable
causa when we have shown conditions which we say, in gravity
for our society, far outweigh the

QUESTION:

On what basis was this defendant arrested?

HR, FREY:

He was arrested for the offense of

transporting — knowingly transporting aliens who were illegally
in the country.
QUESTIONS But at what point was he arrested in the
entire case?
MR. FREY:

After it turned out that the aliens both

couldn't speak English, and when they were interrogated in
Spanish had no papers whatsoever indicating their right to be
in the country,
QUESTION:

But they weren't arrested until after that?

They weren’t arrested just on the fact that they couldn't
speak English?
MR. FREYs

Ho.

That was — they were 'then asked

whether they had papers, since, presumably, they might not be
able to speak English if they had been lawfully admitted.
QUESTIONs

Yes.

MR. FREY:

But an alien, even if he’s lawfully

admitted, has a duty to carry out, I think it’s a 151

QUESTION; All right. That’s what I thought you said.

23
QUESTION?

Earlier you made a distinction.

QUESTION :

Those old ladies can be very suspicious

soma times.
[Laughter. ]
MR. PREY: The question — there is a question apart
from the statute and apart from the general-area probable
cause, there is a question whether in particular circumstances
a search was unreasonable.

For instance, if we yank somebody

out of a car and put them up against the car and patted him
down, for instance, that would be an unreasonable search on
our part.
Well, that’s all I mean to say on —
QUESTION: Well, as I understand it, you’re not
even asserting in this case the right to search at all, but
just the right —
MR. FREY;

No, no —-

QUESTION:

— to ask questions? is that it?

MR. FREY:

That's it. The right to stop.

reading of the opinion of the Court of Appeals, that you were

— have told me of that misunderstanding.

I then gather you mads a different ■»- the government made a
different argument to the Court of Appeals?

24

MR« FREY:

Well, I'm not certain what the government

argued there, but the Court of Appeals was talking about the
Bowman case in the Tenth Circuit, and the Bowman case relied
on (a)(1).

And the Court of Appeals said:

Well, if you rely

on (a)(1), what you're claiming is a very broad authority of
the kind that we're not prepared to say the government has.
And all that I'm saying here is that we are not
relying — we're not saying we could do the same thing any
place outside the border area,

that's at stake in this case

is whether we can do it within the border area.
QUESTION:

But in Chicago or in Omaha, or St, Louis,

we say we can hold them here,

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. FREY;

I don't see that it's fruitful, really,

to get into it.

We say that this is different,

QUESTION: Well, it was fruitful *— it was so fruitful,

25
that the Ninth Circuit thought you were

thought you were

wrong,
QUESTION;

Unanimously»

MR, FREYs

Well, I'm not sure as to what -they

thought we were wrong, but they would not -- I take it, they
would not take issue with our contention that we don't rely
on the Bowman analysis that we could do it any place in the
country.
We are saying that it does make a difference that
we're in the border area here.
Now, the reason the Ninth Circuit thought we were
wrong, unanimously, I believe, is a product of a superficial
analysis of tine issues on their part,

And the same superficial

analysis, it seems to me, is contained in the respondent's
brief.

He looks at the Terry case, and he says Terry requires

articulated suspicion.
Well, the answer to that is that, as I've said
before, there are reasons why you have to have that in Terry.
Here we are dealing with a situation where we have a constitu­
tionally acceptable substitute for particularised suspicion.
If you look at the Camara decision, Mr. Justice
White there spelled out the factors, the persuasive factors
that —
QUESTION*
MR. FREYs

No, the Court did, Mr. Frey.
The Court did; I'm sorry.

It's in your

26

opinion,
— spelled out the factors , the persuasive factors
that combined to support the reasonableness of the inspections
there.
It pointed out that there, was a long history of
judicial and public acceptance,
Movr, we believe that the statute reflects a public
judgment that Congress has made on behalf of fh© people, that
we are willing to submit ourselves to -this kind of intrusion
for the purpose of accomplishing the objective of preventing
illegal entrants from gaining access to the interior.
Second, the Court pointed to the public interest
that was at stake, and we’ve heard a lot about that.

And the

lack of other techniques.
Now, you've heard before that there are other
techniques.

We, of course, are not going to give up our

efforts to detect and return illegal entrants to their homeland,
/

even if the traffic**checking operation is stopped.

But we

think that the traffic-checking operation is a vital link,
we think it’s instrumental, not only in the people it catches,
which is a substantial number, but in the people it discourages
from attempting tb gain entry into' the United States,
I think I’d like to save a couple of minutes for
rebuttal, if I may.
MR. CHIEF .JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well, Mr. Frey.

27

Mr, Cleary.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J„ CLEARY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. CLEARYs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
I don't mind having my brief called superficial if
the en banc Ninth Circuit's reasoning is called superficial.
This case raises a constitutional question of the
highest magnitude, and would be the contention of the
respondent that Terry vs. Ohio and the analysis in Adams vs.
Williams did not effectively answer any of the questions
here, because in Terry vs, Ohio there was an interference with
the liberty of a person on the street, which was held to
constitute a seizure, such as to bring into play the Fourth
Amendment.

And for such a seizure to take place, there must

be objective, articulable facts to justify that seizure.
This Court never reached the issue of interrogation
at that point, but held that, under the concept of the
protective safety of the officer, 'the officer could pat down/
a minimum intrusion, to determine if that person was armed.
And, I believe Mr, Justice White, in his concurring
opinion, pointed out that the man could not be in any waycomp el led to answer any questions under those circumstances,
that it had not been reached, even if there was that
reasonable suspicion

2B
Further, this Court, in Adams vs. Williams, decided
that there must be two requirements for such a momentary stop,
and relied upon Ninth Circuit precedent, Wilson vs. Porter,
Mr. Justice Rehnquist, speaking for the Court, said:
one, there must be suspicion!

and, two, facts.

The intrusions in both of those cases involved, one,
a person on a street, the other a parked car.
In this case we have a car moving on a highway, an
Interstate highway, flagged over by law enforcement officers,
at whim or caprice, for whatever reason.
There is a killer who was executed in California,
Mr. Chessman, for using the red-light technique of flagging
cars over.
I would contend that that intrusion is of a most
important magnitude.
X would start off by saying that the government, in
this case, has not given you the full flavor of the statutory
analysis involved, that we are seeing a gut, a visceral reaction
of the government sayings

We need these things, therefore we’re

going to have them.
There is a serious obstacle involved, and it’s not
the checkpoints to alien traffic.

It's that our government

was founded on a principle, over 200 years ago, in the famous
James Otis case in 1761, with the writs of assistance, on that
we don’t substantiate the hunches, the ESP, the sixth sense of

29

law enforcement officers.
In that case, the famous writ of assistance case,
they asked merely Customs- officers to get untaxed goods in
the Port of Entry,,

And although, with the English judges,

they did get that right, which of course led to the Fourth
Amendment, I am saying that in this particular case we are
dealing with a point some 66 road-miles from the border, a
lot further in than Boston was from the external territorial
limits of the United States.
The Statutory history started in 1862, with the
Cooley Trad© Act, and in that first statute we had dealing
with the regulation a person from outside countries, a racial
tone involved, most assuredly, was that we required reasonable
cause? the statutory history mounts forward, step by step,
there is a .reasonable cause, probable cause.
in 1891, the predecessor, as Justice White analogized
in his dissenting opinion, vie have 1225(a), which is now
section 235 (a) of -the Immigration Act of 1952. That was the
right, at the border, to exercise any powers of inspection?
and til at right was developed on through 1517, and in 1917 it
was expanded for the first time to allow boarding and
searching of vehicles which they, -the officers, believe are
bringing aliens into the United States.
In 1925, just like Carroll had done for the law
enforcement officer, excused the warrant? so vie now have a new

30
section that pops up, ironically created in an appropriations
bill, that gives an except to the warrant under certain
circuits fcances.
That statute in 1925, the source of 287 today,
tracks identical language from the original one which says
that they, when they believe that the vehicle is bringing
aliens into the United States.
In 1946, the Attorney General, in his one-line letter,
saids

We'd like to have the power to stop and search.
Congress merely gave them the right to continue

boarding operations, did not deal with the fundamental question
now before this Court, the right, to interdict traffic on a
highway, moving throughout the United States,
We're dealing with a fundamental right.
In 1952, the limited legislative analysis, which
now creates both sections 1357(a)(1) and 1357
was earlier, but 1357(a)(1).

well, (a)(3)

Ws have there Congress stating*

at the border we don't want indiscriminate questioning or
harassment of citizens returning to the United States? and
would expect -that even at the border probable cause would be
v

necessary to question citizens, that they are committing a
crime or about to commit a crime.
That's the legislative history behind the Act.
Justice

Judge Browning, in his dissent, in Almeida-

Sanchez, referred to the fact that even the legislative history

31
clearly announced that constitutional requirements will be
consistent, and interposed upon this statute, and that the Act
has to be read in such a fashion.
QUESTION s

So is it your argument that at the

border there must be. probable cause?
MR. CLEARYs

No, Your Honor, it is not.

I'm saying

that
QUESTIONS

Well, what ig the authority to stop a

vehicle, or to stop people at the border and interrogate?
MR. CLEARYi The authority in my mind, Your Honor,
would be Boyd ys._ United States, 1886, Carroll vs. United
States, which indicated —
QUESTIONs

Yes, well, that's the constitutional

authority? how about the statute?
MR. CLEARYs

The statutory authority would exist

under 1225(a).
QUESTION :
MR. CLEARY g

How about 1357?
1357 is the exception to the warrant.

That makes note ferende to "at the border".

-If you read

each one of -those four subsections —
QUESTION: Yes, well, I read them, and on their
face — on its face, the language of 1357(a)(3), it just

MR« CLEARY:

I read 1357(a)(1) says "at a reasonable

32
QUESTION s
MR- CLEARY 3
QUESTION:
MR. CLEARYs

Yes.

Yes.

«•» "you may conduct" •—»
But it certainly includes "at the border"?
Because I think —

QUESTION: Doesn't it include "at the border5'?
MR. CLEARY:
in 1225(a),

I would think that it’s covered already

And if one traces back the legislative history,

back to 1891, you will see that the right to stop at the border
was early recognized in our country, in fact with the original
Act of 1875,
tod so that my contention is that although 1357(a)(1)
does give at a reasonable distance from the border, it must
be taken in context with -the empowering section, which is 1225(a)
and tliis is the excepting, for the warrant section,

tod that

in that case, the switch was made in 1946, where the language
was changed ~~ not in 1225 (a) ”»
QUESTION:

But you didn’t -« "at the border", all

you needed was 1225, I take it?
MR. CLEARYs
\

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.
Right, to dispense with either warrant

or probable cause.
MR. CLEARY: That is correct.

They had medical

inspections in the same original legislation.
QUESTION:
MR. CLEARYs

Yes,

Yes.

They talked about the right to examine

33
a person at the border,' and that was the genesis.
QUESTIONS

Of course, 1225 doesn't say "at the

border" either.
MR. CLEARY:

Yes, it does,,

It says:

the right to

enter the United States, reenter, it says all-inclusivei and
if one goes at the earlier legislative sources of this
legislation, it will see that it was oriented at the border,
and then was

expanded, as it has been ex pnded, to today.

And the contention I would make is, in looking at
1357(a)(1) or (a)(3), one should look at 1357(a)(2) and (a)(4),
under the concept of sui generis.
And there, the right to arrest an alien for a
violation of alien law must require the likelihood of escape?
otherwise they have to resort to a warrant.
In the fundamental power to make a felony arrest,
which is authorized to an Immigration officer in subsection
(4) , there is a statement that -there must be the likelihood
of escape? and, even further, it must be, in a sense

if ,

I * m not mistaken —» required that the likelihood of
escape — oh, and the first section, section (2) requires
"in his presence or view".
X would point out further that one of the -most
troubling concepts we have here is that this was an application
of 1357(a)(1).

I heard the Deputy Solicitor General tell me

■that the Court of Appeals went on 1357(a) (1).

I was there at

34

oral argument an banc.
At that time the government counsel relied upon the
escape clause.

He could see he was going down on 1357(a)(3),

with the other cases, and sought to justify a distinction, and
generated 1357(a)(1).
And ironically, you might ask, that a Court which is
otherwise split comes down the track unanimous on 1357(a)(1)?
and the reason why is that — it applies to all courts, even
this Court has different viewpoints? there is sometimes
accommodation.
And that the big point to be made in 1357(a)(1) is
that with Carroll, and the interpretation in Almelda-Sanchess,
even a stop, if one was to scrutinise Supreme Court precedent,
requires probable cause.

And at least we can do, is under

these circumstances, no matter where it might be, require a
reasonable suspicion, which was in some way articulated, by
this Court in Terry vs. Ohioi and it’s the same analysis that
was used by the D. C» Circuit in the Au Yi Lau case,

. .

which is the basis for the Ninth Circuit's adoption of that
rule in not adopting the Tenth Circuit's analysis, which of
course was asserted by this Solicitor General in saying why
there was a confusion on the interpretation of 1357(a)(1),
I would contend that what's before the Court right
now is 1357(a) (1).
QUESTION:

The Ninth Circuit,

it's now settled after

35

this case, I gather, reqtiires what it calls a founded
suspicion for a stop? is that it?
MR. CLEARYs

That is ■>- in fact, Your Honor, it

requires a founded suspicion to believe that there's illegal
aliens.

And what the Court fait was that under Wilson v.

Porter, it required, for any interdiction of highway traffic,
there must be found a suspicion.

They felt that they were

bound, then, by that precedent and could not use this
euphemism of alien searches to justify this type of conduct,
absent a functional equivalent.
I would point out further that the interesting
thing in this case is that we have the statute -- and it's a
good reason why the government backs away from 1357(a) (1) —
is, one, they can't show actual knowledge of an alien? and
the second step is a person believed to be an alien, can they
say that a person who appears to be of Mexican descent in
the area of Southern California, contiguous with the Republic
of Mexico, constitutes some rational basis, reasonable
*

i'

suspicion that that person is an alien.
I would contend, if such ever was the case, that
would be rank racism.
QUESTIONS Weil, I suppose if you're just talking
about words, unless you believe the person, subjectively ~
subjectively ~~ believed him to be an alien, you wouldn't
stop and ask him.

Not — the statute doesn't say unless there's

36

a rational grounds for belief that he is art alien? he's
believed by somebody to be an alien.

And if he weren't

believed by the person to be an alien, he wouldn't be stopped
and asked, would he?
MR. CLEARY; Well, I think there has to be a belief
•that the person is an alien, and the question is, can it be
purely subjective?
tiling whatsoever?

That is to say, can the officer use any*»
And I would have to say that under the

Fourth Amendment analysis, there has to be some basis to a
reviewing court that that was, in a sense, based upon something
and not purely arbitrary; that, there has to be something more
•than a hunch.
QUESTION;
MR. CLEARY;

Rut the statute doesn't say that.
The statute does not say that, but the

point is that one believed to be an alien would have to be
construed, I think, consistent with the Fourth Amendment,
And I think that is the position here that we would take that
under Terry vs. Ohio, that there must be at least two
criteria;

one, suspicious circumstances? and, two, objective

articulable facts.
And we contend that the Ninth Circuit's construction
is consistent with the statute, it implements the statute and
at the same time gives validity to the Fourth Amendment.
The more important thing is that the hunch of the
officer can be used and abused.

In this case we make, note of

37
that because here the only articulable basis given in cross-­
examination was that the person appeared to be of Mexican
descent.
I would suggest to the Court that we are dealing here
with a problem in the area of the Mexican border. And that is
the analysis.
Well# let us take a look.

What do we mean by area

of the Mexican border?
Well# we know it's at least 2,000 miles long in one
respect# but how far does it go inland?
Well# where is the limitation in 1357(a)(1)?
is none.

There is a limitation in 1357(a)(3)5

There

reasonable

distance.
Wow# the government contends;

Well# you have to

interpolate (3) onto (1)# and you coma up with a rationale
for the action,
I would say — there's two cases they cited# and I
believe the Court does have their reply brief at this time.
The first one they cite is Montaa-Hernand®z# a district court
case# appears at pages .14 and 28 of the principal government
brief# in a footnote? and there# because of the heavy alien
population in Sacramento# California, or Bryte, California#
500 miles from -the border# the court upheld the right to stop
and interrogate an alien.
So that's one demonstration of how 1357(a)(1) is

33
used.
The second example cited to us by the government is
in their reply brief# on the last page# the last footnote# the
Saldana case.

There an alien was stopped under 1357(a)(1).

What was the distance from the border?

It was the Will Rogers

Turnpike in Oklahoma# six to seven hundred miles from the
border.
Now# the government can says

We're going to be good

guys, wa’ll only go up to a hundred miles.
I don’t think that these type of powers# dealing
with a serious constitutional question# can be so delegated
to the Executive.

I think there has to be some intervention#

either judicial review or# in the alternative# a warrant,
QUESTIONS

You think the reasonableness standard

must take into account the nature of the country in which the
reasonable distance is to be measured?

Whether it's open#

wild country or whether it’s San .Antonio# Texas# for example#
or some other city?
MR. CLEARYs

I certainly agree# Your Honor.

that one has to consider the geographical territory.

I think
I think

that was thft rationale behind what is called functional
equivalent in the border# but again, as an advocate for a
particular case# I’m talking about a roving patrol operating
some 66 miles north of Ban Diego, the second largest city on
tli© West Coast# halfway between X,os Angeles# which is the

39
largest city on the West Coast*
And I think that under those circxarastancas, such a
roving patrol can’t be condoned, and that this rationale or
distinction by saying that distance «*- true, if we were talking
?
about the Dicotti checkpoint, which I have never known to
exist, No* 4 on government’s map in the Ortiz case, if there
was a roving patrol up in that area, maybe the right to stop
would exist because the area, plus other factors, might give
a reasonable or founded suspicion, or even probable cause
to stop.
QUESTION;

Do you think this officer could have

stopped this car and asked the man for his driver’s license?
MR. CLEARY;
Your Honor.

Certainly not a Border Patrol officer,

2\nd if it was a

and this is an important —

QUESTION; Well, let’s assume it’s a State Patrol
officer*
MR. CLEARY;

Well, then we have to understand

that in the federal system we have, as I am told by this
Court so often, a very limited jurisdiction.

And if you

take the average officer —QUESTION; Well, I just asked

I just don’t ask

you again; how about a State Patrol, Highway Patrol officer,
what if he, with no suspicion at all, he was just making a
license check, a driver’s license check?

Could they have

stopped him and asked him for his driver's license?

40

MR. CLEARY;

In that case —

QUESTION: And. if he didn't have one, he could arrest
him.
MR. CLEARY;

In that case, YOur Honor, I would point

out that that would be inappropriate for several reasons,
that analogy.
First, —
QUESTION: Well, let's don't talk about the analogy.
How about it's validity under the Fourth Amendment?
MR. CLEARY:

His right to stop at random a person

for a driver's license check, in my contention, would not be
appropriate if it went beyond the scope of that.
No. 2, "»■
QUESTION;

All right.

Now, ha stops him and asks

him for his driver's license, he doesn't have it, and he
arrests him for driving without a license.

And he objects to

the ”■» the man claims that his Fourth Amendment rights were
violated.

Is he right or not?
MR. CLEARY:

I think he has a right in California,

and the reason I would say is that a person arrested for non­
possession of a driver's license is not necessarily taken into
custody
QUESTION:

Oh, I know, but I asked you about the

I posed the facts and I asked you the validity under the
Fourth Amendment

41
MR. CLEARY:

And I’m trying to respond# Your Honor»

Under th© Fourth Amendment# if he didn't have a valid basis
for arresting him# he could not make a lawful arrest.
He has the physical power# but you asked it in terms
as to whether or not he had th© authority under the; Fourth
Amendment# and my contention is where a man can turn in#
submit by mail the fact that he does have a driver’s license#
indicates that the right of the State in preserving its
highways has only one means to check —
QUESTION:

I think your answer would be that if

California law authorized the arrest on those facts# that it
would be all right under the Fourth Amendment?
QUESTION; Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.
QUESTION:

Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments#

MR. CLEARY s

The Fourth and Fourteenth.

I would say no# Your Honor# under the Commonwealth
vs. Swanger# Pennsylvania# recent analysis which said even a
roadblock check for driver’s license must have at least
founded suspicion.

Because otherwise the intrusion on

privacy is not justified by the community need.
I would point out again that the traffic situation
is totally different# because we have a State officer# and
again it’s the only means to protect the highways from
incompetent drivers? I think that also there’s a serious
qwsstion in this area.

I’m not in a position to answer as

42

this Court is, but I think the case before the Court deals
with a right of a federal officer in restricting aliens.
I would further point out that the argument of the
government is that this would not apply in New York. City or
in some of the other larger cities, but would apply in San
Diego and in Tucson, for example.

And I think, even further,

we don’t know if the 100-mile limit applies.
I tliink the arbitrariness of that is that, a man's
constitutional rights will vary by where he happens to live.
1 think that people should not be so discriminated against.
I would point out that —■ in the brief we have
indicated a reference to New York City —» sometimes, that
certain sweeps are made, as raised by the Court earlier in
questioning* but I think the issue is you cannot pick out
certain areas because then you're going to get into the
why-ness of the problem.
I think the second thing is that you can justify,
and excuse some type of Camara analysis. There has been no
showing of a warrant in this case.
And I think that that forecloses the use of Camara
in this particular situation.
This particular case is rather unique, in the sense
of — I know there's a previous cas© pending before, the Court,
Guana-Sanches* in this case I would point out that, one, the
objects of the indictment, Count One and Count Two, the named

43
individuals ara the persons that were seised from the
automobile.

And in the same way as if he had an unregistered

machine gun in the back or controlled substance * he would
have standing to object to that.
Further,, these people gave testimony against him,
and used his own statements,,
Third, he got on the stand to deny that testimony5
And, fourth, he was cross-examined by the
prosecutor about moneys found in his pocket.

So there was

a seizure of money at the time of his arrest falling from
this, as we would contend, unlawful stop,,
I would further point out, as to retroactivity in
this case, that we are in a unique posture„

And not to b®

overly technical, we would take advantage of the fact that
the government did not assert non-retroactivity in this
case „
And we would rely upon that factor, which appears
at their brief pages 7 and 8 and on page 9 of the brief,
and —QUESTION:

Mr» Cleary, I want to have the benefit

of your thinking as to the validity of a warrant procedure
for a fixed checkpoint.
MR. CLEARYz

Your Honor, I think that the fixed

checkpoint could be subject, under the Fourth Amendment
concepts, to a warrant.

I think that a warrant can be

44
tailored for a checkpoint based upon an analysis,to use the
Court’s reference., to four points that were cited in your
concurring opinion.
I think, though, that it has to be one that complies
with some procedure, either enunciated by this Court in an
opinion or that there would have to be some change in, say,
Rule 41 of Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
There is, we call it a warrant for inspection in
our area, and there’s soma equivocation as to how it works out.
The difficulty comes in trying to make a showing,
and often, 1 feel that there is not a full adversary showing,
and we even tried, for example, to get statistics on the
aliens coming from the border at the San Clemente checkpoint.
One, -the Border Patrol denied us an opportunity to
get such statistics.
Two, we’ve got an action for mandate pending in the
Ninth Circuit.
So that the question in this area is -that we don’t,
have access to some of this information, and I feel that there
should b® some substantial showing made tc a court -«■ I don’t
know what it would be called — that could allow' other
parties to contest some of the facts to justify the need.
I think it is conceptually feasible, as 1 have
indicated in our brief, that such a warrant could be established.
I think that, as Mr. Sevilla pointed out,

one of the key

45

factors is proximity to the border, in the sense that the
Fifth Circuit's analysis might be certainly eminently
reasonable in the hard case on Serra-Blsnca, but would be
grossly unreasonable in this case.
For example, the reason Mr. Sevilla and I differ
with Judge Turrentine, he held every checkpoint in the Southern
District of California to be the functional equivalent of the
border, even San Clemente? and although one might have a
conclusion to be reached, we might differ with, the reasoning
and the approach to that topic, and yet not foreclose that
area that such "warrants might be possible, or that it could
he considered a functional equivalent.
The second point on retroactivity -»
QUESTION:

Do you suggest that there would have

to be an adversary hearing?

Generally you get a warrant

ex parte.
MR, CLEARY:

Well, Your Honor, I would say -chat

there would be, in a sense, an after-the-fact on a motion to
suppress.

But that in the ease of criminal justice, that

if such notice could be given, I don't know how it would be —
they are renewed usually every ten days, because Rule 41,
I think, provides only now for a ten-day limit on a warrant.
So that there has to be a return on them.
And that some times

and I'm trying to reduce

litigation — we can go in and file motions to suppress until

46

the cows coma home.

But if sometimes the Court? when it’s

dealing with such a touchy area? could give, notice to the
other parties.
And the point I’m trying to suggest right now is;
although .a warrant is certainly possible? the real answer
lies in Congress? in dealing with the alien problem.

And

that? just like in Biswell and Colonnade? the Congress set
forth the search warrant requirement and the other procedures.
And I think that they're in an area where that procedure
could be adopted.

I don't think those two cases apply.

QUESTION: Wall? Congress made its

made the effort

in this statute? but you're chewing on that right now? you
just want it to go back and. have another fruitless job?
MR, CLEARY;

No? Your Honor? I think that — I think

if Congress was faced with the tiling? they do provide for all
viewpoints to be expressed? and I think that there would be
a much more workable conclusion established? and I think that
some of these 'things were done at a time when the problems
that are now before the Court weren't fully presented to the
Congress? and I think that? consistent with our tripartite
form of government? we should use different avenues for
different results,
Here I'm pleading the Fourth Amendment situation?
and the rights of the individual?given the statutory language?
but more properly? how they are applied by federal agents.

47
I would point out further to the Court that one of
the roost serious concerns in this case was that this defendant
now respondent, was stopped because the three occupants
appeared of Mexican descent»
No. l,The driver is a Spanish-speaking Puerto RicanAmerican citisen.
No. 2, one is a Mexican from Guadalajara.
But, No. 3, the third one, is a woman from Guatemala
Now, the concern was;

Mexican appearing, alone.

Arid counsel, being sensitive to this area, laid in the record
in this case as to the reason for the stop,

find I think the

Solicitor General properly contended that there could be
arbitrariness shown on his power, if this Court were to give
him carte blanche power under 1357(a)(1), that even that
carte blanche power, exercised in, say, the area of the
Mexican border, could be done arbitrarily if done purely
on the basis of race.

A Yick Wo concept.

Now, first, I would start off, in their government
reply brief, they respond to this issue and this issue alone.
They contend that I don’t have standing because I haven't,
filed a cross-petition,
I would point out two things.

That cuts both ways,

They use that argument on page 11 in the Bowen brief? and,
No. 2, the analysis I am making here is my conclusion on the
last page of my brief says very simply:

I want, you to uphold

48
the Mint!-! Circuit.
I'm not asking you to order the charges dismissed.
I'm here defending an opinion.

I'm asking for no more than

upholding the unanimous action of the Ninth Circuit.
I do believe that under Ballard vs. United States,
I can assert any reason to defend that particular opinion.
Now, the interesting aspect was, before I raised
the racial discriminatory issue,, the government, in five places
in its brief, raises "Mexican appearing" as the basis of
giving them something, maybe less than reasonable suspicion,
but a justification for the stop.
It’s our contention that you can't use race alone.
Possibly as one of many factors, it can be used.

It- might

be used in many other things,
".Spanish speaking", we have a problem, because I
think we have a substantial portion of the citizen population
that speaks Spanish and Spanish only.
The analogy I’d like to refer to was an opinion
cited by the government in a footnote following up the
&u Yi Lau case* the Cheung Tin Wong case, which Judge MacKinnon
of the D. C, Circuit said;

You will never have suspicion

alone basset upon Oriental appearance for a stop.
However, suspicion, plus the fact ‘that the man
couldn't speak English and was in white clothes, gave justifi­
cation for a. momentary stop.

QUESTION*

Well, Mr. Cleary, supposing the

Immigration officers, proceeding under 1357(a)(1), to
interrogate any alien or person believed to be an alien,
what factors does he use in reaching his initiati determination
of believing the person to be an alien?

I mean, what would

you suggest?
MR. CLEARYs

My suggestion, Your Honor, would be

a multiplicity, like -QUESTION:

What particular facts?

MR. CLEARYs

Okay.

The first thing I would use

would be, one, the proximity to the border.

I would base it

upon factors that might lead me to believe that the person
was ail alien, such as if he didn’t speak the language, it
might alert me, but would certainly not justify me in, stopping
the man.

I think -QUESTION:

Inability to speak -the language, I

suppose you'd have a hard time determining that before you
actually stopped him.
MR, CLEARY;

Before you stopped hire, I think the

problem would be is that you would have to have some other
basis and

:
QUESTION:

Well, what factors would you suggest

taking into consideration in making the initial stop?
MR. CLEARY’;

My factors would be that the critical

aspect is the source of his entry, i.e., —

50
QUESTION? Well# 1 thought you were going to give
me some factors# from 'die way you began that sentence»
MR. CLEARY:

Your Honor# the only thing I can

suggest is that factors would determine in a multiplicity of
circumstances»

If I followed along the border and I saw

footprints running in a mile to a certain bush# I could walk
up and I found the man at the bush# I would say that’s a
factor to believe that that person is an alien# and yet I
have to talk to him# I'm not addressing him by his race,
and I think I vrould have a right as a. law enforcement officer
to stop him.
But to give you something that I could go by
physical appearance# in these days where the freedom of the
individual is so protected# I can't give you any basis that
would justify# on appearance alone, a stop that would rise
to the level of founded suspicion.
In Terry vs . . Ohio# -i ' was a man walking back and
forth outside the jewelry, sufficient to justify the stop?
And the answer was # the Court held it took twenty minutes of
watching the conduct# the experienced officer — and at that
time he has probably even probable cause to believe a
conspiracy to rob was taking place.
My contention is ‘that you can’t use the fact of -now if he had on# "Made in Mexico" on bis back# on his shirt
or "Tlajuana”# then maybe that might be an appearance factor

51
that would help out.
But I an hard-pressed to give you any facts that
would suit this case, where an officer, at whim or caprice,
some 66 miles from the border, could stop a car on the basis
of appearance.
I can't say old cars or new cars.

In fact, what

shocks me is the government, in their reply brief in Ortiz,
say that you can tall a Mexican resident because they're
thin.
How many fat aliens have I represented?
You can test because they have coarse hands, that
they wear coarse clothes, they have their hair cut in a
certain way.
I've had my hair cut once or twice in Tiajuana.
The point I'm trying to say is that there are facts,
but the facts are difficult. And the reason is, there's a
balancing of interest.
QUESTION; Oh at you're really saying is you can't get
there from here; aren't you?
You can't stop them, there's no basis for stopping
and inquiring.
MR. CLEARY;
QUESTION;

There's no basis
You said

and you have a very broad

experience, as we know, Mr. Cleary, if you can't think of any
reason, how about these Border Patrol officers who haven't

nearly your breadth of experience or education?
MR. CLEARY;

If 1 was at the San Clemente checkpoint

and .1 saw a car drive by with a Baja# California# license
plata# I think I might have a fact to step a car.
Thank you very ranch# Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Cleary.

You have about three minutes left# 1 think# Mr. Frey,
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L, FREY, ESQ.#
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FREY; Thank you# Mr. Chief Justice.
I think# in effect, you’ve just heard my opponent
say that there is no basis on which we can constitutionally
stop cars at the San Clemente checkpoint or any distance in
from the border.
Now# we think that just to stop a car and ask people
about their citizenship is a limited intrusion.
is an important distinction from Camara.

We -think this

The warrant issue#

which I was unable to reach in my opening argument# is treated
simply;

Well# in Camara# warrant was required# and therefore

we can't rely on Camara,
Well# of course# in Camara, they were searching what
was arguably a home# the power they asserted was the power to
search homes and# in See# the power to search business
premises, which the Court treated as a home.
Here we are talking about# not a search but a stop#

53
and not a home but a car»
These factors make a difference,, not only in the
constitutional reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment, but
in the necessity for a warrant.
Now, with respect to the question of whether a.
warrant is needed, I think that, the answer is not simply
whether we could get a warrant.

We have problems about

getting warrants, but that would be true of the border also.
We could easily get warrants for the border, we could get
warrants that would say where we could set up our Ports of
Entry, warrants that would try to describe who w® could stop,
how we could go about, searching people.
There isn’t a logical difference between, at least,
the checkpoints and the border Ports of Entry, from the stand­
point of s

could we get a warrant?
I don't think the answer that we could get a

warrant is sufficient.
Now, there are problems about our ability to get a
warrant.
Roving patrol operations cover immense varieties
of operations. There can be an operation like this, totally
unexpected, due to bad weather.

Now, possibly our San

Clemente checkpoint warrant could encompass the authority to
make roving patrol stops.
But we have other situations.

We have farm checks.

54
During Idle harvest season;, when we expect it's likely for
migrant workers to be moving from farms in the southern area
to farms in -the northern area, we send a patrol car around
on the farm roads.

Me see a truck drive by, with a group of

migrant v?orkers, we may stop and check the citizenship of
these people.
There is, in a sense, an issues

suppose that a

Border Patrol car is driving along the road and it sees a car
drive by, six persons who appear to be Mexicans -- and I think
feat to ask the officer to ignore that fact would be to ignore
the reasonableness requirement of -the Fourth Amendment,
Sitting uncomfortably, nervously, looking away from
him, he's suspicious.

He can't maybe articulate more than

that, which ray opponant says is not enough, but the question
is:

can he just stop the car and say, "I'd like to inquire

about your citizenship", mid make a brief inquiry of that,
nature,
Nov;, we think -- that's not the kind of thing that
could be really subjected to a warrant.

In effect, Congress

has made the judgment, ‘the warrant judgment, that we should be
allowed to do this*
And we urge this Court to sustain that judgment, and
allow roving patrol stops for interrogation without warrants.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Frey.

Hr» Cleary, you appeared at our request, by appoint­
ment, and on behalf of the Court I thank you for your
assistance.
MR. CLEARY; Thank you very much, Your Honor.
