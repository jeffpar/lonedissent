PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 73-1573, Withrow against Larkin.
Miss Brown, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MISS BETTY R. BROWN
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MISS BROWN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This is an appeal from the judgment of the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin
in which that court declared Section 448(18)(7) of the
Wisconsin statutes unconstitutional and preliminarily
enjoined all utilization of that subsection of the statute.
This preliminary injunctive relief was granted
in an action brought in the district court under the Civil
Rights Act by the Appellee whose name is Dr. Larkin against
the Appellants who are the members of the Wisconsin Medical
Examining Board.
There are three questions in this case.
The first question is whether a district court
in granting a mere motion for a preliminary injunction can
declare a state statute unconstitutional and preliminarily
enjoin all utilization of that statute.
QUESTION:

Mis Brown, I — certainly, it is not

my purpose to disturb the planned order of your argument.

4
but I trust that some time during the course of

your

argument you will get to the point that the three-judge
court order has noitf been amended and no longer does declare
the statute unconstitutional.
MISS BROWN:

That is right.

Over six months after

this appeal was taken and jurisdiction was noted and the
briefs were submitted* there was a modification of the judg­
ment and so we also have that situation presently existing
in which the Court, instead of saying — as it orally
declared and is included in its decision and judgment that
the statute was unconstitutional; it now in the modified
judgment said there is a likelihood of success and it also,
without any evidence to support this, modified the judgment
to assert that there is irreparable harm.
QUESTION:
MISS BROWN:
QUESTION:

Right.
So there has been —
If that were the only judgment we had

from the beginning, It would be very clear that this Court
would be without jurisdiction In this appeal, Wouldn’t it?
MISS BROWN:
QUESTION:

No, I don't believe so, your Honor.
Why, just looking at the language of

the now-existing judgment which appears on page 20 of the
suggestion of mootness filed here on September 3, it doesn’t
declare anything unconstitutional.

It just enjoins the

application of these statutes agains t

the Plaintiff,

Duane Larkin, M.D., on the grounds that he would suffer
irreparable injury if the statute were to be applied
against him and that the Plaintiff’s challenge to the
constitutionality of said statute has a high likelihood of
success.
You don't — we don't have — we wouldn't have
direct Appellate jurisdiction of any such order as that,
would we?
MISS BROWN:

We wouldn’t be here, your Honor, if

that was the initial order.
QUESTION:
MISS BROWN:
QUESTION:
MISS BROWN:

You couldn’t be.
But we —
You couldn’t be here, could you?
Right, but we would have been here

because of the content of the decision whivch would be
followed by a final injunctive order and came to the same
conclusions which we believe are completely erroneous,
namely that there is a violation of due process by the per
se possession of investigative and adjudicative powers by
an administrative agency.
So that, if the modified judgment had been entered
initially, we couldn’t be 'nere.

But when the final judgment

was entered, we would have been.
QUESTION:

Well, when» as or if some final judgment

were entered declaring the statute unconstitutional, but the

6
MISS BROWN:

Well, I doubt that there would be

any and or if primarily because of the content of their
decision, your Honor.
QUESTION:

They had mad e

up their minds.

This may — the injunction may have been

amended but the court had already declared the statute
unconstitutional.
MISS BROWN:
QUESTION:
MISS BROWN:

Yes, your HOnor.
Did they withdraw that declaration?
No.

The decision is still in effect.

It is being cited and it is being followed.
QUESTION:

Well, they did amend their judgment of

January 31st, 197^» didn’t they?

That is what this says on

the top of page 20.
MISS BROWN:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
Well, to that extent they did change

their original order.
QUESTION:

Let me read you a sentence from 28 USC

Section 1253 in order to call my brother Stewart’s attention
to it.

"Except as otherwise provided by law, any party may

appeal to the Supreme Court from an order granting or denying
after notice and hearing an interlocutory or permanent
injunction.”
Now, I take it you meet the — even if you take it the amended judgment is what is before us.
judgment.

It is an amended

Nov;, it is an interlocutory injunction and then

7
it goes on to say, "Required to be heard by a court of three
judges."
Now, if it meets that test it certainly was an
interlocutory injunction.
MISS BROWN:

Yes.

Yes, it was, your Honor.

So that there was this modification but there is
also, of course, other questions here which, in any shape
or form, will arise again and do need resolution.

And this,

of course, is the real question on the merits here and that
is, whether the per se, by itself — possession and exercise
by an administrative agency of both statutory powers to
investigate and statutory powers to adjudicate is a violation
of the due process clause of the 14th Amendment.
QUESTION:

I suppose if it is you might have a

suggestion in your brief of some impact on the Federal
Communications Commission, for example.
MISS BROWN:

I think it would have impact, your

Honor, on all the administrative agencies, state, federal,
local.

I think that it has an impact on — I think that

under the broad holding in this case, the federal adminis­
trative procedure act is unconstitutional because it does
recognize that these various functions which are the basic
nature of administrative agencies can exist and be exercised
by such agencies.
There is also a third question here which is, I

3
think is a very important one and that is whether, under the
circumstances of this case, the district court had any
discretion, any power to grant a motion for a preliminary
injunction and if it had any discretion, whether it abused
that discretion in this case.
The fact situation — somewhat briefly, I hope —
is this.
QUESTION:

Will you tell us, too, what evidence

was taken on this subject or did the court act solely on the
! pleadings?
MISS BROWN:

There was absolutely no evidence in

any shape or form which either showed the availability of
injunctive relief in this type of case or established grounds
for the granting of the motion.

There was nothing, no

evidence, in the form of testimony, in the form of affidavits,
in any shape or form which established that there was no
adequate remedy at law, that there had been exhaustion of
administrative remedies if applicable, that there would be
irreparable harm if the requested relief was not granted,
that there was a reasonable likelihood of success on the
merits an d

that granting the relief would not do undue

harm to the public interest which, of course, I think your
Honorss is a big and important concern when we are dealing
with state statutes which are aimed at protecting the
welfare of the citizens of the state.

9
There was no evidence on any of these, in any
shape or form.
The facts are briefly this;

Dr. Larkin, who is

the Appellee here, is a resident of the State of Michigan.
He applied to the Appellant, the Wisconsin Medical Examining
Board, for a license to practice medicine in the State of
Wisconsin.

He was granted that license in August of 1971

on the basis of the reciprocity provisions between Wisconsin
and Michigan.
The Medical Examining Board is a state administra­
tive agency.

It is the agency \tfhich issues license to

practice medicine and surgery.

It is an agency also which

has a statutory duty to investigate practices inimical to
public health and if it finds such practices, to either
warn or reprimand the licensees or, if necessary, refer the
matter to the district attorney for either criminal prose­
cution or civil revocation of a license.
The board itself has no power to suspend other
than temporarily or revoke the medical license of a doctor.
This has to be —
QUESTION:
MISS BROWN:

This is on the merits?
Yes.

Now, this is one of the unique

situations in which a professional license can be revoked
or suspended other than temporarily only by a court and not
by the administrative agency itself.

The only power that the

10

board has is under the statute which the Court here declared
unconstitutional, Section 4*}8 (8) (18> (7) and this statute
allows the board to temporarily suspend the license of the
licensee for not more than three months upon determination
that he has engaged in practices which are immoral or unpro­
fessional in nature.
They also have power to extend this for another
three months.

But that is a maximum of their suspension

powers.
Well, Dr. Larkin did get his license on the basis
of reciprocity.

He very promptly went to Milwaukee, Wisconsin

and he rented offices and he did so under an alias.
used the name "Glen Johnson" instead of his own name

He
in

renting these offices and he began performing abortions.
He performed these every weekend.

He flew in

from Detroit to Milwaukee and on Friday, Saturday and Sunday
he performed abortions and then he returned to the State of
Michigan.
It appears that by February of 1973 — in other
words about a year and a half after he started — he himself
was coming to Milwaukee on only very infrequent occasions
and evidence indicated that he was there once between
February of 1973 and the date of this federal court activity
in the latter part of 1973.
QUESTION:

Was the evidence •— the information that

11
the board acquired in its investigatory process, is that it?
MISS BROWN:

Right, sir.

The only evidence in

this record is in the form of affidavits.

Attached to some

of the affidavits are various notices and there is also
attached the board's findings of fact, conclusions of law
and decisions xrtiich it arrived at at the conclusion of its
investigative hearing and it is in that material which is
part of the record attached to affidavits that this material
is revealed.
So that he was flying in and performing these
abortions over weekends but since February of ’53[sic] his
abortion business was being carried on primarily by others
with a financial arrangement between Dr. Larkin and another
doctor.
In June of 1973> the board issued and it mailed
to Dr. Larkin a notice of investigative hearing.

It was

about to perform its duty under Section 448(17) of the
statutes to investigate practices

inimical

to public

health.
It sent this notice to Dr. Larkin, told him the —
it included the subject of the investigation, it invited
Dr. Larkin with or without counsel to attend, although the
investigation was ex parte in character.
QUESTION:

I don't know whether it is relevant

here, Miss Brown, but if you know offhand, would it be a

12
violation of the Wisconsin statute of some kind to have a
license under one name and carry on the practice of medicine
under another name?
MISS BROWN:

Yes, sir, it is a violation of the

criminal law and —
QUESTION:

Apart from the medical problem.

MISS BROWN:

Right.

There is a statute which

makes it a misdemeanor for a medical

licensee, under certain

circumstances, to use a name other than the name under which
he was licensed.

There are ifs, ands and buts in the statute

but that is the sense of it and, in addition, of course,
that is a practice inimical

to public health because the

patient has no idea who he is dealing with.
It is a sure guarantee against malpractice suits,
among other things, which have become increasingly popular
when you don’t even know who the individual is who is
performing services on you.
QUESTION:

It may not be a sure guarantee, but

it might be a big help.
MISS BROWN:

Well, it’s a hindrance, anyway.

So the board sent out this notice of investigative
hearing and upon receipt of that notice, Dr. Larkin
immediately filed a civil rights action in the Federal
District Court.

In this action he sought initially only

injunctive relief.

He sought a temporary restraining order,

13
a preliminary Injunction and a permanent injunction aimed
at stopping the investigative hearing.
The district court judge denied the motion for the
temporary restraining order and

Larkin very promptly —

that is, six days later — filed an unverified amended
complaint and in this amended complaint

he sought not only

injunctive relief but he also sought a declaratory relief.
He sought the declaration that the Wisconsin
statutes, SEctions 448(17)and 448(18)(7) were unconstitu­
tional and he asked for the convening of the three-judge
court.
There was in the interim some more motions and
various affidavits filed but the district court refused to
enjoin the investigative hearing and that hearing was held
as scheduled on July 12th and 13th, 1973.
QUESTION:

Is that the same three-judge court?

Have you been before the same three judges all
the time in this proceedings?
MISS BROWN:

Yes.

That is, the three-judge court

was not formed at the time that I am referring to right
now.

They were formed shortly afterwards.
The investigative hearing by the board was allowed

to proceed.

It was not until the board sent notice of a

contested hearing — and those words, "contested hearing"
under Wisconsin law have a great deal of significance

14
because there is a whole array of procedural rights that
attach at that point but the board &d, operating under
another statute — not the one

giving them a duty to

investigate — but operating under 448 (18)(7), which gives
them power, limited power to temporarily suspend the license,
they did send to Dr, Larkin a notice of contested hearing
on the subject of whether his license should be temporarily
suspended.
That notice is set forth at length in the brief
and as you will note, it very carefully sets forth the
issues at the proposed contested hearing.
QUESTION:

It is, in effect, order to show cause

functionally?
MISS BROWN:

Well, it really was more than that.

It was really bringing a — starting up a whole contested
proceedings in which the person had the right to be present
to testify, to counsel, to have cross-examination of witneses,
to a written statement of the issues, to burden of proof on
his opponent — a whole list which I have set forth i\rith
statutory reference in one of the footnotes to my brief.
But it was a whole complicated procedure in which
tnere was very careful guarding of procedural rights of a
licensee but at the point where he got this notice of a
contested hearing, Dr. Larkin’s attorney again went into
court anri <■» —

15

preliminary injunction, et cetera, not of the investigative
hearing which was the sole subject of the pleadings in this
case, but of the proposed contested hearing on whether his
license should be revoked.
In getting this material, the district court
without any hearing whatsoever, did enter a temporary
restraining order and did grant the motion for a three-judge
court so a three-judge court was then convened and the threejudge court held a non-evidentiary hearing on the motion
for preliminary injunction; no evidence whatsoever in any
shape or form which went to the question of whether a
preliminary injunction should issue.
There also was no evidence whatsoever presented —
and quite properly so — on the subject of the constitution­
ality of the presumptively constitutional Wisconsin statutes
so that the hearing before the three-judge court was oral
argument, period, without even a pleading base for the relief
being sought.
QUESTION:

In the affidavits that you describe

that were before the board in the investigation stage, was
there any denial by Dr. Larkin of the allegations about
practicing — holding out practice under another name?
MISS BROWN:
’weren't affidavits.

Before the board, your HOnor, there
There was actual sworn testimony by

witnesses before the board.

IS
QUESTION:
MISS BROUN:

But did he deny that?
He was invited to attend and he was

also invited to come before the board and to inform it of
any explanation or any material he wished to present to the
board during their investigative hearing and he declined to
do so.
His counsel sat through the entire Investigative
hearing and his counsel did address the board but Dr. Larkin
himself never appeared and never informed the boards despite
its invitations of any material which would cast doubt upon
or a reflection upon the sworn testimony and other evidence
that the board itself took during its investigation.
But the three-judge court, during this argument
on preliminary injunction, off the bench declares the statute
unconstitutional and it also enjoins the use of the statute
not only against Dr. Larkin but against everybody.
It came down with the decision that — and here I
am quoting them —"For the board temporarily to suspend
Dr. Larkin’s license —"

which, of course, the board hadn’t

done — "at its own contested hearing on charges evolving
from its own investigation, would constitute a denial to
hirn of rights to procedural due process.

So in response to the motion for preliminary

their judgment.
Originally they did this orally.

probable

The other side’s

brief was submitted and the board found itself with this
order banning all utilization of the statutes so crippling
that the interests of the citizens of the State of Wisconsin
were being harmed so the board did go to the three-judge
court and ask for a modification so that the injunction
would only protect Dr. Larkin and not prohibit the board
from utilizing the statute against everybody.
QUESTION:

Vlas there any claim made in the oral

argument' before the three-judge court that this was a class

MISS BROWN:

No, no.

No, there was no class

18
QUESTION:

Of course. If the statute were,in fact,

in law unconstitutional, it would apply to everyone whether
you had a class action or not, I assume.
MISS BROWN:

Yes.

Yes, sir.

So that we did ask

this modification of the judgment in order to make the
preliminary injunctions, as they should properly have been,
run only against Dr. Larkin.
Well, the court then took an"opportunity to change
its judgment in a more — much more broader way.

They did

what we asked — in other words, allowing the board to
proceed against others, but they also came up with this
fiction about Irreparable harm to Dr. Larkin in which there
was absolutely no evidence and there was not even an
allegation that he would suffer Irreparable harm if the
preliminary injunction was not ordered — was not granted.
QUESTION:

You mean that to suspend a man from

practice of medicine for six months is not irreparable harm?
MISS BROWN:

I would submit — well, in the first

place, we don't know whether he was going to be suspended
at all.
QUESTION:
MISS BROWN:

But he could be.
He could be.

Right.

But we have

Would that be irreparable harm?

that we have some unique fact3 in this case and that is —

MISS BROWN:

MISS BROWN:
QUESTION:

So they did have some facts.

MISS BROWN:

In the form of the proceedings and

notices of the board which were attached to affidavits

affidavits.

But what I am saying —

You made the statement there was no

You meant there was no oral evidence.

There

were affidavits.
MISS:

Brown:

There were affidavits,your Honor,

but my point is that they did not relate

in any way to

whether or not a preliminary injunction could issue in
this case.
QUESTION:

If the Bar Association took away your

20
license to practice law for six months, would you consider
that irreparable harm?
MISS BROWN:

I certainly would If the Bar

Association of Wisconsin —
QUESTION:
MISS BROWN:

Well, whafcfs the difference?
— did and I was practicing in

Wisconsin.
If I was a member of the Michigan Bar and I flew
into Wisconsin once in six months, I don’t know that the
injury would be so great.
QUESTION:

Will you' come to the facts of this

particular case?
MISS BROWN:

Well, the facts are, your Honor, that

Dr. Larkin had. a license to practice medicine in Michigan.
At the time of these hearings, he was not coming to Wisconsin,
other than on very infrequent occasions.
His operation in Milwaukee was being run by others
with whom he shared the fee — he split fees.

He was not

personally in the day-to-day business of sitting in an
office and having patients come to him for medical service.
And he was practicing medicine in the State of Michigan
where he was physicali,1/ present on all but very few
occasions.
So that under these circumstances, your Honor,
I doubt that they could establish, had they attempted to do

23

.

attempted to do so, which they did not do.

But I doubt

that they could have established the type of Irreparable
harm which this Court has recently talked about in — oh,
cases such as Sampson versus Murray.

There is no way, I

believe, that they could have established that.
But the point is, your Honor, they didn't even
try.
QUESTION:

I suppose his probability of success

would depend upon his denial of and refuting the information
that was before the medical board.
Could the court make any evaluation of the
probability of success on what it had before it without any
denial from him?
Could the three-judge court make any judgment?
MISS BROWN:

The only thing — and this, of course,

is another very important point
three-judge

— the only thing the

court did was to issue the decision.

There

There were no conclusions of law

as are required by Rule 52.
Now, of course, that rule requires findings of
fact and conclusions of law but it gives an alternative.
That is, instead of being in that form, it can be in the
form of the judgment — or the decision.
But the decision in this case, which, of course,
is in the jurisdictional statement Appendix, contains no

findings of fact or conclusions of law as required by the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Rules about entry of judgment to start the appeal time

QUESTION:

Among other things, while from this

MR. FRIEBERT:

Yes, I’d be happy to comment on it

immediately, Mr. Chief Justice.
The court is not required to make explicit findings
of fact If it talces care of that matter within a written
opinion and I believe that the court is taking care of that
matter in its written opinion.

A rule, the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure says
it can go either way and that is the way they went.

QUESTION:

When did they do that?

MR. FRIEBERT:

Well, I believe that the three-judge

court did make an error in its original statement by not
saying that there was irreparable injury, although I think
that they were saying that without using the magic words.
They indicated he would lose his license to prac­
tice and they also indicated he would have a loss of liberty
due to the notoriety of having been a person who lost his
license, citing appropriate cases from this Court.
So they, without using the magic words, they did
make the appropriate findings.
When the state went back and asked for an amend­
ment to the judgment so that they could go after other
doctors, I filed a counter request that they make the formal
finding.

It is not an attempt to declare an entire statu­

It is an attempt to declare an entire statutory
scheme unconstitutional as applied to these very limited
factual circumstances.
As such, it would not have the major impact on the

APA and we submit that if the Court were to decide against
us, it would have a major impact on administrative proceedings
because the Court would then be giving its stamp of approval
to an anything-goes situation because this is about as
aggravated a mixing of function as one can imagine on the
facts and the reason it is so aggravated is because it is
not just a question of mixing of functions within an
administrative agency which is the way the state would like
to paint the picture.
That is not this case.

This case involves the

same people, the Appellants, the very same people investi­
gating Dr. Larkin by a formal investigation which they
characterised in the trial court to be akin to a grand jury
investigation.
That is what they told the trial court what they
were doing and since they made the representation that they
were like grand jurors engaging in an investigation, on two
occasions the court, the trial court — and not a three-judge
court, this was just a single judge, refused a temporary
restraining order.

counsel in this case.

He was also counsel to the board

and brought in by an employee but the testimony was taken
by these board members themselves and they questioned these
people and hence the analogy which they said to the grand
j ury.
QUESTION:

Well, what if they are,right at the

conclusion of that so-called investigative procedure, the
board had simply suspended the license?
MR. FRIEBERT:

I think that that would have been

QUESTION:

You mean, if a board just sits and

hears testimony and then decides, that is unconstitutional?
MR. PRIEBERT:

Yes.

I think without giving notice

that that is what they are going to do and giving me an
opportunity to cross-examine or respond’, I do.
QUESTION:

Well, that may be so but it would n’t

be because of a mixing of functions.

they were going to do.

QUESTION:

Mr.

Friebert, in Arizona, where I

practiced, I sat on one of the grievance committees and we
would have a session of the committee whereby we would hear
a complaint — in other words, hear a complaining witness
and simply decide whether there was sufficient basis to go
ahead and notify the lawyer who was being complained against
and if we decided that there was no sufficient basis, we'd
dismiss it.
If we decided there was sufficient basis, then we
would notify him of charges and hold a full hearing.
Nov;, do you think that violates the three - judge
district court’s opinion here?
MR. FRIEBERT:

The same group would then be the

trial people?
QUESTION:

Precisely.

MR. FRIEBERT:

Yes, I think that that would violate

procedural due process.
In Wisconsin, I might add, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,
that there is — with respect to revoking or suspending the
license to practice law, the charges are brought to the
Supreme Court of Wisconsin,

[which] appoints a judge to

separately decide the factual matters and then the matter is
and makes a recommendation so there is a splitting of
functions within the Bar in Wisconsin.

QUESTION:

That was true in Arizona, too, after

the administrative committee got through it went to the
Board of Governors of the Supreme Court.

But here, I take

it, your medical thing goes eventually into court.
MR. PRIEBERT:

The medical thing goes eventually,

under the way they are moving in this ease, to two courts.
I should state, at the conclusion of their investigative
hearing, they issued formal findings of fact and conclusions
of law and in those findings of fact and conclusions of lav/,
they resolved each and every factual question in this case.
That case was then transmitted to the district
attorney for further proceedings.

Do you suppose that was partly because

there was no contest after the notice?

No, he did not.

Why not ?

MR. FRIEBERT:

I didn't — It was on my advice.

I didnt see any reason for him to appear.

QUESTION:

Mr. Friebert, what do you consider is

before this Court as of today?
MR. FRIEBERT:

anathema to the —
QUESTION:

May I interrupt you a minute?

MR. FRIEBERT:
QUESTION:
I had in mind.

Excuse me.

You aren't quite answering the question

I, perhaps, was not clear, that two orders

that were entered in this case that had been discussed here
today, the one of December 21, 1973 and the subsequent one
of '74, July the 25, I think.
Do you consider both of them to be before us?
Or, if not, which one?
MR. FRIEBERT:

I think they are both here.

I really

view the subsequent order as a modification but really more
of an explanation of what they had said previously.
If they really said that in their opinion, if the

34
point was missed, it has been cleared up.
That is how I viewed the subsequent order.
If, of course, it is only the first order, well,
then, I think a reversal could be done In one sentence to
tell then to do what they did subsequently and then we are
no further along.
QUESTION:

The problem is, if I may say so, in

their first action of December of 1973, they held this
statute unconstitutional.
MR. FRIEBERT:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Now, in July of 1974, they seem, at

least, if one can read the English language, to have
retreated from that position and simply said that the
Plaintiff8s challenge to the constitutionality of the
statute has a high likelihood of success.
Now, that certainly is inconsistent and those
orders say different things.
MR. FRIEBERT:

In fact —- and if uhe Court views

only the first Judgment as up here, it is automatic, they
should not have declared a statute unconstitutional in a
preliminary injunction.
QUESTION:

Oh, no, I don't agree with you at all.

Mx* FRIEBERT;

I think the case law is clear on

that, that their finding that they have to make is a high
probability of success in the preliminary injunction stage.

35
unless they are combining the preliminary injunction with
the final judgment which they could have done but did not
do.
QUESTION:

I thought, though, the law was it is

sufficient to issue a preliminary injunction, that you find
a high probability of success.
But, surely, if you want — if the court wants
to go further than that and say, this

isn’t just a high

probability of success, it is a 100 percent thing in our
eyes, I would think that they are perfectly justified at
the preliminary stage of saying, this is unconstitutional
and argument won't change our minds on these legal points.
MR. PRIEBERT:

Well, this Court has said it in

Mayo and I don't wish to dispute in not asking for the over­
turning of Mayo.

I think that that was an error by the

three-judge court which was corrected.
But it doesn’t get us along the road much because
it would go — they ivould go back down and they would do
what they did and the same basic issues remain.
QUESTION:
this document on this

What was the ground for your filing
September 3rd suggestion of mootness?

MR. PRIEBERT:

If that was the issue before the

Court, whether they should not have issued — if the court
it noted
felt that the reason a note of probable jurisdiction and
ordered its oral argument was because they made a finding of

36
unconstitutionality, then that issue is moot because they
have subsequently corrected that situation and furthermore,
if the Court felt that they were in error for not making
an explicit finding of irreparable injury, they have now
done so, so that is the reason we are here and those two
issues are moot.
The underlying issues are not really mooted except
that I think and it is our position that the settled law
of the — and I believe it is the settled law — is that
you cannot combine within the same person all of the
functions of accusing, investigating and then proposing to
be the judges —

Do I understand you do not think that

this amended judgment raises the question as to the predicate
of our jurisdiction to review either judgment?
MR. PRIEBERT:

Waste of time or not, if we don't

have jurisdiction, we don't have jurisdiction, whatever
may be a waste of time.
MR. PRIEBERT:

Oh, I think you have jurisdiction

under the circumstances and appeal —
QUESTION:

Even if we are to take the only Judgment

before us as the amended judgment?
MR. PRIEBERT:

Oh, yes.

37
QUESTION:

Why?

MR. FRIEBERT:

I think because the statute allows

appeals from preliminary injunctions.

Only preliminary injunctions entered

on the grounds of unconstitutionality.
MR. FRIEBERT:

Yes, and there is

Yes„ that's it.

Which is that Stat situation, by

So I think we are here.

QUESTION:

And there was no other reason for the

three-judge district courts

enjoining of the statute in

this case than its serious doubt about its constitutionality,
was there?
There was no independent basis for the court to
enjoin?
MR. PRIEBERT:

No.

The independent basis awaits

further discovery on the first cause of action which is
that our assertion, which we would intend to prove if and
when we get back, if necessary, that the board is biased
against abortionists.
I would like to clear up something which is, first
oa

all, Miss Brown stated that the complaint did not challenge

the suspension authority of the board.
That is just not true.

39
The complaint — the amended complaint at para­
graph 3 challenges the authority of the board under 448(18)
to suspend the license and temporarily suspend the license
and at paragraph 3» refers back to the paragraph preceding
for its reasons and

one of the reasons stated is without

being afforded a trial by jury or by persons other than his
accusers.
The complaint — the amended complaint very
clearly raises this issue and that amended complaint was
in court-before the board decided to try and take his
license away for six months so we were in the courthouse
before that.
Secondly, the charges against Dr. Larkin do not
relate to his professional competency and I think that that
is very important.
There is no exigent circumstances in this situation.
The charges against him are all for past practices which
they allege occurred and which we deny or assert are not
offenses and are protected.
They have to do with some kind of fee-splitting
which, if you read the Wisconsin statute on it, it is
incomprehensible.
It has to do with the alleged use of a different
name which the Wisconsin statute does not prohibit until
there is a prior finding by the board that this would xvork

40

to the detriments no prior finding was there and it has to
do with using an unlicensed physician, or physician
unlicensed in Wisconsin.
QUESTION:

Now, you say this was denied.

By what process or means was this denied?
MR. FRIEBERT:
QUESTION:

the board.

No —

MR. FRIEBERT:
QUESTION:

By

I'm sorry.

-— you said that Dr. Larkin — Mr, Larkin

whatever he is, denied these things.
MR. FRIEBERT:

How did he deny them?

In my appearance on his behalf

before the board in which I told them and made these
arguments to them and which I think also demonstrates that
at least — well, I'd rather not state.
I made both statements as contained in footnote
13 to the board,
And finally, the use of unlicensed physician,
unlicensed in Wisconsin, there are two, there is a factual
defense, one — two factual defenses.
One, he was licensed in another country and under
a prevailing opinion of the Attorney General, a doctor
unlicensed in Wisconsin who is licensed elsewhere can
practice in conjunction with a Wisconsin doctor.
Secondly, that an unlicensed doctor or person
can practice medicine in. the state of a medical emergency

which is our opinion.

It was created by the very board

themselves due to their extensive harrassment over a period
of two years of persons in Wisconsin who engaged in the
practice of abortions despite rulings from the Eastern
and Western district of Wisconsin declaring the Wisconsin
statute unconstitutional.
Dr. Larkin had to get his his own restraining
order because of the public duress by these Appellants and
the public threats by the Attorney General of Wisconsin,
the District Attorney that they might not mind the orders
of the Federal District Court.
But those points have nothing to do with his
professional competency so there is no medical emergency
in the picture to require such a drastic fast movement
and I think that those factors are extremely important
towards — in determining a way due process allows faster
activity.
Certainly one of the factors would be whether
there is an urgent situation.
In fact, the suggestion for mootness demonstrates
some urgent situations which the beard felt they needed
relief from.

That was in the case of two alcoholics and

one narcotic addict doctor and for them, they just wanted
to suspend their license, even though they were a hazard
to the community, to the state in general and they indicated

'42

for them there will be rehabilitation available because
they would not seek revocation.
For an abortionist in the scene and a situation
who may have used or allegedly used the wrong name on
occasion or signed a lease under the wrong name or used the
doctor unlicensed in Wisconsin or engaged in fee-splitting
which we dispute and deny, there is no hope for rehabili­
tation.
So* apparently, drug addicts and alcoholics
get greater protection.
QUESTION:

Any statute in Wisconsin against

signing your alleged name on a lease?
MR. FRIEBERT:

No.

You can use, under Wisconsin

common law, I believe you can use any name and you don't
have to achieve a formal name change.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume

after lunch.
[Whereupon, a recess was taken for luncheon
from 12:00 o'clock noon to 1:02 o'clock p.m.]

AFTERNOON SESSION
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Friebert.

1:P2 pm.

You may continue,

You have a few minutes left.

MR. FRIEBERT:

Thank you, Mr.

Chief Justice.

I should like to point out in continuation that
there really are no facts in dispute.
In the suggestion of mootness at page 12, I have
reprinted the brief presented by thfse

Appellants to the

trial court in which they distinguished Larkin and make a
flat statement.
"The Larkin case was, of course, on its facts
unique in that the board Investigated charges and then
proposed to hold a contested hearing on those charges.”
t

And thus we have the total combining of functions

situation —
QUESTION:

Did the board recommend to the district

attorney that he file specific certain kinds of charges
against you?
MR. FRIEBERT:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And in accordance with the statute, they

may so-called "prefer charges" with the district attorney.
Is that it?
MR. FRIEBERT:

Correct, Mr. Justice White and they

have done that —
QUESTION:

Well, you don’t — I would suppose that

is your easiest case to argue.
Maybe you have got a hard case no matter what,
but it is easier to argue it if you put that in it, isn't
it?
MR. PRIEBERT:

That they have already done that,

yes, they have.
QUESTION:

And then if they want to proceed, to a

contested hearing themselves.
MR. FRIEBERT:

Well, under the statute, they have

made findings of fact and inclusions of law prior to the
issuance of the preliminary injunction which resolved each
and every fact situation, factual matter which they proposed
to — and submitted that to the district attorney and then
they then proposed to hold a hearing to suspend on the very
same charges.
They go to the district attorney because the
district attorney either can commence criminal charges — I
might add that he has decided not to do that — or to
revoke.
Revocation proceedings in Wisconsin are judicial
proceedings prosecuted by the district attorney.
And even at the end of a revocation proceeding, the
trial judge does not have to revoke.
license.

He can suspend the

So the only punishment that might ever have been

achieved by — in this situation — might be the proposed

45
suspension by the board.
QUESTION:

When you say the district attorney

decided not to prefer charges, is there anything in the
record that supports that?
MR. FRIEBERT:

No.

But it i?as stated on oral

argument to the three-judge court.
QUESTION:

Perhaps the district attorney ,

like

others, is just waiting for the outcome of this case.
MR. FRIEBERT:
QUESTION:

No, on the original case?

We don’t know that.

This case we

are arguing today.
MR. FRIEBERT:

No, the district attdr ney stated

that he would only pursue revocation proceedings and they
haven't proceeded, I might add, but that was the position
that he had taken.
Now, this does not then imply anything with
respect to infringement upon the APA because if the APA had
been involved, this kind of situation never would have
occurred.
QUESTION:

Has the district attorney taken any

action at all, either for revocation or on the criminal
charge?
MR. FRIEBERT:

No.

He has just — he has made

that public statement, the one I just indicated, which was
Ghat he would not pursue criminal charges, but would

only

46
pursue revocation proceedings.
QUESTION:

And is the situation the sane?

I know

this is outside the record, but I am curious as to
Dr. Cannon.
MR. FRIEBERT:

No, I don't know of any subsequent

activity with respect to Dr. Cannon subsequent to the
Supreme Court’s decisions on the abortion cases.
I don't know whether he has been investigated or
not, though.

There was substantial activity irwith respect

to this board despite restraining orders entered by Judge
Doyle in the Western District of Wisconsin and even after
restraining orders were entered, this board proposed to
take his license away because he was administering abortions
which is unprofessional conduct according to 448(18).
Now, the situation as far as this is concerned
with this kind of totality of integration of activities is
no xvay to justify it.
This does not involve economic regulation

like

the FTC or the SEC.
There is no urgency in the situation because there
is no assertion that he is a bad. doctor.
QUESTION:

Well, you say it doesn’t involve

economic regulations.

Certainly it is regulating somebody’s

way of making a living, isn't it?
MR. FRIEBERT:

Yes.

I mean the agency is not

dealing with economic regulation in the same manner as the
FTC doe3 so that a decision or a mingling, a submingling
within their area of expertise might be allowable under
due process because we are talking about economic regulation.
QUESTION:

Well, aren't we talking about economic

regulation here, too?
MR. FRIEBERT:

The economics of Dr. Larkin’s right

to make a living but not in the same sense as the FTC
regulates the economy or the charge given to them by Con­
gress and therefore, that the due process might allow a
certain amount of intermingling with respect

to an agency

like that which is not the situation here.
QUESTION:

Well, since you mentioned the Federal

Trade Commission, isn’t this some of the alleged conduct
found by the board, that is, his setting up an office under
a false name something like misbranding?
MR. FRIEBERT:

No, that lease and all of those

situations are, you know, it seems to say that Dr. Larkin
was not a known person and that he was a fly-by-night
doctor, so to speak.
In October of 1971, everybody in the State of
Wisconsin knew about Dr. Larkin.

He was on the front pages

of the paper and everybody knew ivhere his clinic was.
He closed down because he thought he was being
threatened with prosecution despite the Babbitt's

decision.

In December of 1971 we commenced an action in
the federal court for a restraining order against Mr. McCAnn,
the district attorney and the attorney general and we
received a restraining order in December of 1971 —
QUESTION:

Yes, but he has never denied the

board’s determination made on sworn testimony that he
opened an office in Milwaukee under a false name.
MR. FRIEBERT:

I don't think that is their charge.

Their charge is, he signed a lease under a different name
and that — the man is signing a lease, there is no way that
people did not know that that was Dr. Larkin's clinic and
we talked about him not being
litigation.

Everybody knows that that was

Dr. Larkin’s

There is no showing or statement on that at all.
I might add that 448.02 (4) does not prohibit a

doctor from practicing in Wisconsin under an assumed name
that might add that.

It only prohibits it in any instance

So it is only In Instances after

This is — and that section was added In

after — because the statute used to be a flat prohibition
and then they put that In taking away the flat prohibition.
So it is not illegal in Wisconsin.

And so they

really come under or try to bring them under the catchall,

practice or detrimental to the best interests, which is
another issue in the case which we haven’t brought up and
which a three-judge court mentioned, namely, that that is

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

The case is submitted.

[Whereupon, at 1:09 o’clock p.m,, the case was

submitted.]
