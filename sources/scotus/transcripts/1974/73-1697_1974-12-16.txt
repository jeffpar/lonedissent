ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH L, CORNELL
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. CORNELLS
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This is an appeal by appellant Standard Pressed

Steel Company from a final decision of a Washington Court of
Appeals sustaining the assessment of a Washington business
and occupation tax on appellant for the privilege of engaging
in wholesaling activity within the State of Washington.

The

Washington State Supreme Court declined review in this case.
The tax is measured by unapportioned gross receipts
resulting from sales of products manufactured outside of the
State and sold to Washington customers.
The basic questions in this cause are very simply
stated to are appellant’s activities within the State of
Washington sufficient to justify the imposition of the subject
tax, and, two, is the tax constitutionally defective as
applied to appellant in that it is measured by gross receipts
derived largely from activities accruing outside of the
State of Washington?
Appellant is a Pennsylvania corporation with

4
facilities located in Pennsylvania and California.

The

in-state activity conducted in Washington was conducted solely
by appellant's resident employee

in the State of Washington

who received a salary for his services,, a flat fee, and worked
out of a portion of one room of his home.

And I think since

the general principles in this taxing area are rather easy to
state but I believe rather difficult to apply to the particular
facts

situation, it might be well to review the facts briefly.
Mr. Martinson's activity in the State of Washington, as

far as the customer is concerned, brought him into contact
solely with Boeing qualification engineers.

His primary

function was to, through this contact, become aware of
Boeing's possible needs for appellant's products and to forward
this information, together with Boeing's specifications on
that product to the out-of-state offices where if the
decision were made to attempt to qualify as approved Boeing
source in this product, sample pieces would be manufactured
and submitted to the Boeing qualification engineers who would
conduct tests and evaluate the product.

And if it met Boeing's

minimum specification, appellant would be approved as a
qualified source for the product and sales negotiations and
sales promotion would then ensue, which could possibly lead
to a sale.
As reflected by the record, competing companies would
also have qualified, in many cases on particular parts, and

5
they would also be attempting to negotiate sales as well»
Appellant’s resident employee is not involved in the
sales negotiation or sales promotion at any time, rather he
is bypassed completely.

All of these activities take place

and occur with appellant’s employees located outside of the
State# in Pennsylvania and California.

Mr. Martinson’s

activities also — and this is approximately 10 percent of
his time; the duties I just mentioned consume approximately
90 percent of his time — the remaining portion of his time
was spent in what the State has characterised as a problem­
solving process.
In this regard, if Boeing experienced a problem in the
use of one of appellant’s products, Mr. Martinson would be
contacted and he in turn would forward this information to the
out-of-state employees of appellant, who would resolve the
problem and Martinson would present the solution to the Boeing
engineers.
Two cases, I believe, which are probably the most
closely in point on this issue involve General Motors Corpora­
tion v. Washington where this Court considered the same tax
in Washington on different facts, and Horton Company v. Department
of Revenue.
The court below and the State have placed heavy reliance
on the General Motors decision, and I believe it represents
the furthest extension of the ability of a State to tax

6
which is sustained by this Court as regards an unapportioned
gross receipts tax.

And the State has characterised the

basic issue before this Court as whether or not the General
Motors decision can be factually distinguished on a constitu­
tional basis from the present case.
In this regard, the General Motors decision can he
distinguished in several significant respects.

First, and I

think the most critical distinguishing factor was that
General Motors maintained in Washington a very large and
substantial intrastate business making sales to Washington
customers on which it voluntarily paid the Washington business
and occupation tax.

Additionally, General Motors made sales

in interstate commerce which the Court indicated would not be
subject to the tax were it not for the presence of this
intrastate business.

And the Court held that because of the

existence of the intrastate business and because General Motors
had mingled its interstate sales with the intrastate business,
that the burden was on the taxpayer to show the activities of
the intrastate business were not associated with the sales in
interstate commerce, and further to show that such activities
were not decisive factors in establishing and maintaining the
market for the interstate sale3.
In the case at bar, it * s an undisputed fact and it's
clear from the record that there is no question there is no
intrastate business per se in the same terms ae. General Motors

making sales to customers.
The General Motors decision is further distinguishable
in that General Motors, in channeling its interstate sales
through the local outlet, gained the advantages of a local
business, and the Court held that interstate sales cannot be
channeled through a local business so that the advantages of
local commerce are obtained and still maintain immunity as
to the sales in interstate commerce.
In this regard, I think it should be apparent that there
would be delivery and communication problems, for example,
which a Washington customer would face in dealing with appellant
that would not be present were a local business present
within the State of Washington.
QUESTIO"T- Did either Pennsylvania or California
tax these gross receipts?
MR. CORNELL:

Wo, they did not.

I think the kind of tax that is imposed by the
State of Washington here because of its

I think it's an

unwise economic policy, it’s a very tough tax.
impose this kind of a tax.

Very few States

And therefore, Pennsylvania and

California do not impose a tax measured by gross receipts.
QUESTION:

Was it briefly a tax on the gross

receipts of your client from its sales to Boeing?
MR. CORNELL:

Yes.

And other Washington customers,

although our contact is solely with Boeing.

3

QUESTION:

You're not urging apportionment here

if you Should lose on the basic petition?
MR. CORNELL;

Yes, x am.

Apportionment comes up in

several different ways in the Court's language.

Is the State

taxing activities which occur outside of the State? Is the
tax such that the State is exacting more than a fair return?
And my brief does raise the apportionment question.

But I

think many of the principles really can be said in many
different ways.

It comes down to one point.

Is it fair in

this case, and is it in violation of both due process and
the commerce clause to impose an unapportioned gross receipts
tax on a business where the gross receipts are derived largely
from activities occurring outside of the State?
QUESTION; Do you know of any fair way to apportion
here if we get to that?
MR. CORNELL;

That's a difficult question.

For

example, this Court in General Motors v. District of Columbia
case, while it hesitated to get into the apportionment, I
believe did mention that there are instances where payroll, for
example, is measured, the payroll by Washington employees would
be prorated or compared with the payroll of employees outside
of the State also involved in these' sales.

And I believe there

are other factors as well — property located within the
State, although in this case there is no property located
within the State and there never was.

9
QUESTION:

Isn't this

„.

you are talking

about you are starting to tax the gross income and then you have
to divide it up by these percentages rather than just the
gross receipts of sales which conceivably occur in the State?
MR. CORNELL:
QUESTION:

I don't believe I follow your question.

Well, you were citing the cases where

you say that you have to show what percentage of payroll in the
taxing

jurisdiction is to the payroll elsewhere.

And I was

asking you if that kind of analysis hasn't been, more commonly
applied to a situation where the taxing jurisdiction seeks to
tax gross income, period, not simply gross sales which conceivably
occur within the States.
MR. CORNELL:

Yes.

I think that's correct.

I believe

in the General Motors v. District of Columbia case, however,
that all of the income there being taxed resulted from sales
to individuals within the District of Columbia and the Court
urged apportionment in that case as well, and that was the
basis of the Court's decision

striking down the tax.

I believe that the General Motors decision is further
distinguishable in arriving at whether or not appellant's
activities in Washington are sufficient local incident on which
to justify the tax in

that the General Motors

personnel,

without going into detail, engaged in substantial sales promotion
and other kinds of activities in the State of Washington which
are in sharp contrast to the activities of appellant in

10

Washington.

And I believe it strains the imagination to

equate the activities of our one employee with a bundle of
corporate activities and maze of local connections which the
Court felt were present in the General Motors decision.
QUESTION:

This employee worked out of his own home,

did he?
MR. CORNELL:
QUESTION:

Was he full time?

MR. CORNELL:
QUESTION:

Yes, he did, a portion of one room.

Yes, he was full time.

He used a portion of one room in his

house.
MR. CORNELL: - Urn- hxnra.
QUESTION:

To perform this full-time work for you.

MR. CORNELL:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And would you say it's engineering work,

although the fact is his degree was in animal husbandry, I
think.
MR. CORNELL:
QUESTION:

Um-hmra.

How about in the telephone book, wa3 he

listed?
MR. CORNELL:

I believe, if I recall the facts

correctly, that there was an answering service and the Standard
Pressed Steel telephone number was listed in the telephone book.
QUESTION:
man's home?

And what number was that?

Was that this

IX
MR. CORNELL:

ito, it was an answering service, and

the answering service would contact this man.

That is how he

got his telephone messages.
QUESTION:

Did he have any secretarial help?

MR. CORNELL:
QUESTION:

Not in the State of Washington, no.

What did he do when he wanted to

communicate with —
MR. CORNELL:

Many of the exhibits are handwritten,

and at least my copies are somewhat illegible.

He either

handwrites them, or on occasion he would apparently telephone
and a secretary located in Pennsylvania or California would
type tiie message.
QUESTION:

I see.

QUESTION:

You referred to General Motors v. District

of Columbia at one point.

What’s the citation of that case?

I don't find it.
MR. CORNELL:

It’s not cited in the briefs.

380 UvS.
QUESTION:

That would be about right.

Don’t stop

your argument now for about five —
MR. CORNELL:

I believe also that the nature of the

activities conducted by appellant in Washington has to be
considered.

For example, the Genera]^ Motors personnel, they

were involved very iieavily and the Court made repeated reference
to the intimate relationship between General Motors personnel

12

in Washington, in the Washington General Motors decision, in
connection with the dealer organizations within the State of
Washington, and pointed out that the promotional activities in
that case were the nature of fostering or creating a consumer
need or demand for the product and the further promotion of
General Motors parts, products, or services being superior to
those of competitors and best able to meet the needs of the
consumer.
There was no similar activity which takes place in
the State of Washington in this case.

Rather, the activity,

if it's promotion in nature, you might say that Mr. Martinson's
activities do assist in seeing that minimum standards for
Boeing are met so that the possibility of sales negotiations
taking place is present.
The Morton decision, I believe, is closer in point
on the facts and appellant relies, X think, very heavily on
this case because of the similarity in the facts.

The Morton

Company again, just like the General Motors' operation in
Washington, had present within the State of Illinois a large
intrastate outlet making sales directly to Illinois consumers
and on which it voluntarily paid the Illinois privilege tax
measured by gross receipts.

In addition there were sales in

interstate commerce tokich the Court indicated would not be
subject to the tax were it not for the presence of the local
intrastate business, and again held that the taxpayer had to

13
meet the burdens of showing that the activities of the
interstate business were not associated with the sales in
interstate commerce and that such activities were not decisive
factors in establishing and maintaining the market for inter­
state sales.
And, again, since we don-'t have an intrastate
business here, at least appellant does not have to meet this
same kind of burden in this case.
There was one class of sales in interstate commerce,
however, which thi3 Court held was exempt, and these were
a direct order type of situation, and the Court held there
that it was beyond the realm of permissible judgment to
attribute the activities of the intrastate business to this
type of sale, and therefore, these sales were so clearly in
interstate commerce as to be exempt from this kind of a tax.
Similarly, in the present cause, all orders ore
the direct order type, and X believe on the authority of
Norton are exempt from this kind of a tax.
The State,however, and the court below focused on
Martinson, his presence within the State and his activities.
But in this regard, as X read the Norton decision, the same
kinds of activities were conducted by Norton engineers in
the State of Illinois, and those activities were not of
sufficient local incidence to justify the Imposition of the
gross receipts tax on the direct order type of sales.

14
We are told, for example, that the Norton engineers
consulted with prospective customers as to their needs and
offered technical and engineering assistance and advice in the
use of the Norton products.

And I believe these activities

closely parallel the activities of Martinson in connection
with the qualification duties and problem-solving kinds of
duties in the State of Washington.
QUESTION:

I thought Martinson was not an engineer.

MR. CORNELL:

Martinson was not an engineer as sxich,

but his activities were geared toward engineering kinds of
activities.

Before he started performing his duties, appellant

did give him training.

This is a very specialised kind of

business involving a part which is used for — it's aerospace
fasteners, and they are highly machined nuts, bolts, and rivets
used in the aerospace industry.
area of engineering.

So it involves a very narrow

Martinson did receive training initially,

Martinson also received ongoing training.

His'

with Boeing were solely with Boeing engineers.

dealings
The kinds

of information he forwarded onto Boeing or onto appellant
concern engineering kinds of things.

What are the specifica­

tions of the Boeing company as to a particular product?
What are they looking for here?

And I think it requires some

engineering knowledge.
I believe that the court below in the State perhaps
have confused in-state activity with an in-state business, and

15

the two are not synonymous.

As pointed out by this Court in

Nippert v. City of Richmond, interstate commerce of necessity
always involves activities in more than one taxing State, and
you can always point to an activity as some sort of a local
incident.

But the question is is that local incident sufficient

to justify the imposition of the tax?

And I believe in this

case here — for example, solicitor cases involve activities
within a State attempting to impose the tax.

But that activity

is not . a sufficient local incident on which to justify the
imposition of the tax.
I believe the circumstances in the case at bar
here present an even clearer case for exemption than would
exist in the Horton decision because there is no local intra­
state business present here, and I think it makes the Court's
work somewhat easier in deciding .

this case than it faced

in the Horton decision.
Appellant would also submit that the solicitor cases
support appellant's position in this cause.

And in this regard

I would submit that the activities of traveling salesmen in
Washington would be a far more substantial activity, far more
instrumental in bringing about sales to Washington customers
than the activities of Martinson in Washington.
QUESTION:

Your typical solicitor or drummer case,

though, is a man who didn't reside in the State, wasn’t he?
He was just a transient?

16
MR. CORNELL:

Well? he may.

And in this regard I

believe Justice Douglas complained in his dissent to the
ilippert v. Richmond case that the decision would apply equally
to resident or nonresident traveling salesmen.

And I don't

believe that the fact of residency also would be a significant
factor because that doesn't pertain to their activities.
same activities could take place in

The

a taxing State Whether or

not they are a resident of that State.

That would be a mere

coincidence.
QUESTION;

If Martinson had just flown in one day

a week and done everything that he did from a place in
California, do you think the State's case would be just as
strong as it is here?
MR. COXiNELL;

I think it might be as strong or as

weak? depending on hov; you look at it.

I think basically it

would be the same case, because the contacts would be — and
this is a distinguishing point, I believe, from the solicitor
cases as to a particular customer here, the contacts are
I believe systematic and continuous, and I think we would
have to concede on that point.

And I believe if you flew in

every week to meet with the customer, that that would be a
systematic and continuous contact.

But the nature of trio

activities, I think, in the case of a traveling salesman in
terms of exploiting the entire Washington market and making
sales to Washington customers x-rould be a far more significant

17
kind of activity than the activity of Martinson.

While there

is a systematic and continuous contact, we have to look at the
nature of his activities and what is he doing?

What dees he

have to offer Boeing here?
QUESTION:

Interstate commerce requires some servicing

by the vendors in interstate commerce, doesn't it?
MR. CORNELL:

Yes.

And many of the cases in which

a tax has not been sustained by this Court have involved what
you might call continuous and systematic kinds of activities
within a State.

But, again, it’s the type of activity and

it's perhaps the extent of the activity within the taxing
State that is the governing factor in all of these cases.
Cases where this kind of a tax has been sustained,
involve clearly localized activity, such as manufacturing where
you have a sales office through which sales are channeled.
Martinson here doss not have any participation in sales.

He

does not promote the product and sales are not being channeled
through his office.

If you wish to contact the consumer, the

customer, or, I'm sorry, the manufacturer, the seller, you
have to call them generally in Pennsylvania, and there are time
factors which make that communication somewhat difficult.
not face to face.

It’s

And appellant has chosen to operate on

this basis in interstate commerce and to accept the competitive
disadvantages which flow from that, because they are operating
in interstate commerce.

18

QUESTION;

Mr. Cornell,

I.

suppose it's of no

consequence *— are we talking about much money here?
MR. CORNELL;

Wall, the money involved is a stipulated

amount before this Court, it’s about $34,000 roughly.

The

State has •—
QUESTION:

Over how long a period?

MR. CORNELL:
of 1969.

January 1 of 1965 through June 30

In addition there is another assessment — this is

not in the record

which was assessed up to the time that

Standard Pressed Steel decided to avoid further hassle, at
least until this case is decided, they pulled their man out.
So there is an assessment up to the point he is terminated,
which is about the time his deposition was taken, and there
is no further assessment.

So there is a greater dollar amount

involved.
QUESTION:

But it’s of great consequence to the

State, of course, because there must be other taxpayers in
similar positions,
MR. CORNELL:

I can presume that there probably are

who would be operating in some sort of a similar capacity.
And, of course, appellant would like to operate in this way
in the future as well.

So it does have an impact on them

that would go beyond the amount of the dollars that are involved
in this case.
Appellant in this case would concede, of course, as

19

has been stated by this Court on many different occasions that
the State can exact a fair return for benefits provided and
according to the level of activity occurring within the State.
And the same rule, of course, should be applied here.
In this regard, I would point out two things:

First

of all, a nonapportioned gross receipts tax does not make any
allowance for activities occurring outside of the State, and
in this case where there is a significant amount of activity
occurring outside of the State from which these gross receipts
are derived, in this case, I think by the very nature and
incidence of the tax, the same tax is payable whether or not
all these activities take place within the State.
taxed as if they do take place within the State.

They are
The State

here is exacting more than a fair return.
There are also always benefits provided to any
business, including a business operating in interstate commerce.
And I would submit here that the benefits given by the State
are no more substantial in this case than would be supplied
in the solicitor cases, perhaps General Motors v. District
of Columbia, other cases involving taxes being struck down
because of a failure to properly apportion — Evco v. Jones,
a very recent case decided by this Court in 1972, it*s recent
in the context of this kind of a situation, where the Court
there in citing from Adams Manufacturing Co. v. Storen,
presenting a quote, and I believe the quote is of some benefit

20

to this case, said that the vice of the statute as applied
to receipts in. interstate sales is that the tax includes in
its measure without apportionment receipts derived.from
activities in interstate commerce and that the exaction is of
such a character that if lawful, it xnay be in substance laid
to the fullest extent by States in which those goods are sold
— here that would be Washington -- as well as those in which
they are manufactured — which would be Pennsylvania or
California.

Interstate commerce would thus be subjected to

the risk of a double tax burden to which intrastate commerce
is not exposed and which the commerce clause forbids.
I would like to reserve some time for rebuttal,
so I will end my remarks now if there are no further questions.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well.

Mr. Attorney General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SLADE GORTON
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. GORTONs
the Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This case on the surface at least appears to

involve primarily a question as to the required nexus or
jurisdictional threshold necessary to sustain the Washington
gross receipts tax.
much more.

But a closer look shows that it involves

The nexus or jurisdictional threshold question

cannot realistically be looked at in isolation.

We must also

examine the assertion that the tax here imposed discriminates

21
against, interstate commerce or exposes the taxpayer's

inter-"

state business to multiple burdens.
I propose to discuss each of these problems, and the
relationship between them.

Put in terms of your decision in

General Motors, I intend to establish two propositions:
First, that the imposition of our gross receipts tax in this
case is consistent with the criteria established by the
majority in General Motors .

Indeed, that it is even more

soundly based than is the decision in that case.
Second, I propose to show that our tax here is
imposed in a manner which will satisfy the basic concerns
expressed in the two dissenting opinions in the General Motors
case and that the answer to those concerns is to be found in
decisions of this Court dating back more than 40 years.
Standard Pressed Steel is the manufacturer and whole­
saler of highly technical and specialised aerospace fasteners
with plants in Pennsylvania and California.
customers was the Boeing Company in Seattle.

One of its major
The State of

Washington levied a gross receipts tax on Standard’s wholesale
sales to Boeing which Standard here seeks to recover.
During the early part of the period for which the
taxes were levied, Standard had an office in Seattle.

That

office was closed early in 1966, at which time Standard assigned
one full-time employee, one Martinson, to its Boeing account.
Martinson was a Washington resident with an office in his home.

22
Standard denominated him a sales engineer and he reported to
the company's sales managers.
Martinson spent 100 percent of his time representing
Standard in its relationship with Boeing.

Most of his time

he spent in qualifying Standard's products for purchase by
Boeing.

That qualification procedure xfas an absolute pre~

requisite to Boeing purchase or use of any of Standard's
products.
Martinson also worked with Boeing's engineers in
solving problems arising out of Boeing's use of Standard's
products after they were qualified, calling in outside
technical assistance which cams into the State when necessary.
He kept Standard informed as to who was who in Boeing's
constantly changing purchasing hierarchy, suggested sales
campaigns, and did some promotional hosting.
Martinson's activities were clearly more decisive
factors in establishing and holding Standard's market with
Boeing than were these of the Washington employees of General
Motors in holding its local market considered in your last
case involving our gross receipts tax.

General Motors is our

largest national corporation, selling perhaps our most widely
advertised all-national products.

Standard, on the other hand,

sold specialty products to a single customer which imposed
rigid standards on its suppliers.

There can be no question

as to the overwhelmingly more decisive nature of Martinson's

23
activities in establishing and maintaining Standard* s market
in Washington State than was the case with the service of
General Motors* local employees in your decision involving
that corporation.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gorton# does the record show what

percentage of Standard's gross income was derived from the
sales to Boeing?
MR. GORTON:

Of its whole gross income?

No, the

>

record makes no such showing.

This was obviously a relatively

small portion of it.
Moreover, it can be calculated from the records of
the two cases that Martinson's activities resulted in a greater
dollar volume of sales in Washington than the volume, at least
of the Chevrolet Division of General Motors, divided by the
number of its employees in the State.
Next let's compare Martinson's activities with the
facts in the Norton case.

In Norton a gross receipts tax based

on that firm's sales volume in Illinois was upheld to the
extent that it was based on sales to which Norton's in-state
office was connected only by reason of having taken orders
for items not in stock, or for special equipment, or in order
to reduce freight charges by accumulating and reconsigning
shipments originating out of state.

These services were found

to be in the Court's own word "helpful" to Norton in competing
for business in Illinois, thus subjecting those sales to taxation.

24
Only aales to Illinois customers in which Norton’s
Illinois office played no part at all except for making available
engineering and technical advice were exempt from taxation.
Martinson’s role in Standard’s sales to Boeing was
more vital to those sales than that of the Illinois office of
the Norton Company in its contested sales which were held
taxable. If the only concern of the Court in this case were
the degree to which Martinson's activities were decisive
factors in creating Standard’s market with Boeing, the answer
is so obviously in the affirmative as to render the controversy
insufficiently important to have been brought before this
Court at all.
But nevertheless, both Norton and General Motors
and for that matter the vast majority of other significant
cases involving State taxation of what was asserted to be
interstate commerce ware decided by this Court by less than
unanimous decisions.

The expressed concern of the dissenters

in General Motors and 1 suspect of members of the majority
as well, was the threat of multiple taxation or discrimination
against interstate commerce

and the consequent advisability

or necessity of apportionment of a gross receipts tax.
It is perhaps sufficient to respond that appellant
has utterly failed to show the existence of multiple taxation
in fact in this case.

Indeed, it could not do so.

Standard’s

interest in this case is not the avoidance of multiple taxation,

2s
but the avoidance of all taxation on its Washington business.
If Pennsylvania or California were to attempt to levy a tax
on Standard's sales transactions with Boeing in Washington
State, Standard's challenge to that attempt would be completely
successful under the doctrine of Evco v. Jones, Gwin, White &_
Prince, Freeman v. Hewitt, and Adams Manufacturing v. Storen.
In fact, as far as v/e can ascertain, this Court has never
permitted the originating State to tax the receipts from sales
to customers beyond their borders.

Standard here seeks to avoid

paying its own way, its fair share of the State tax burden
by escaping taxation measured by the proceeds of those sales
in either the originating or the destination State.
It's appropriate, however, to go beyond the fact of
the absence of multiple tax burdens and to examine the question
of whether such burdens are possible in theory. Tiven as a
result of the pattern of Washington gross receipts taxation,
they are not.

As I have just pointed out, this Court has

never permitted the State or origin to impose either a gross
receipts tax or a sales tax on the proceeds of the sale to a
customer beyond its borders.

Thus, there is no need for

requiring apportionment on the part of the destination State.
You consistently have preferred the destination State in your
decisions.
The concept of apportionment has never arisen in
connection with sales or use taxes, for example.

It should not,

26

by the same reason, apply in connection with gross receipt
taxas on sales of tangible personal property.

In concept such

taxes are identical to sales taxes? each is measured by the
proceeds from or the price of a transaction or transactions..
QUESTION:

On that basis, Washington could charge

a gross receipts tax on any sales made to local residents,
whether there are any employees of the seller in the State or
not.
MR. GORTON;

From the point of view of the commerce

clause —
QUESTION;

Isn't that right?

MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:

— Mr. Justice Blackznim.
I mean, your argument would be just as

good in that situation,
MR. GORTON:

The argument would be just as good from

a conceptual point of view; it would not from the point of
view of the history of your decisions, as they relate to
due process.

We have already established the due process

jurisdiction of the State.

Once we have established that,

we are saying that a sales taxanda gross receipts tax is
identical.

We are admitting that we must establish that

jurisdictional nexus to impose any tax at all in the first
instance.
QUESTION:

How about the National Bella?: Hesse case.

Did that involve both the commerce claim, the due process

MR. GORTON;

Yes.

In that case, there was, however,

It was a mail order catalog seller.

It had no employee, it did nothing in the State of Illinois
other than to send catalogs into the State and send

by

common carrier its goods into the State.
QUESTION:

But that was the due process claim.

What

about the — it also involved the commerce claim, didn’t it?
MR. GORTONs

They made a commerce claim in it.

Theoretically at least the Court never needed to reach that,
because Illinois had no jurisdiction to levy a tax at all.
And the Court said under those circumstances that perhaps
apportionment would solve the problem.
The point I am making, Mr. Justice Stewart, is that
apportionment doesn't solve the problem, or apportionment
solves the problem of multiple tax burdens while creating
a greater problem of the escape from any taxation at all of
many transfers in interstate commerce.

We believe that the

actual results of your case are consistent with the proposition
that a preference for the destination State which you have
invariably granted solves both problems, both the problem of
multiple taxation and the problem of the escape from their
fair share of taxes of any company.

gross receipts tax, I mean really, is that the sales tax is

Of course they are interstate sales.

There is no question about that.
QUESTION:

So my Brother White is quits correct,

isn't he, in saying that the tax is imposed directly upon

interstate activity.
MR. GORTON:

That depends on your technical definition

30
of the incidents.

in interstate commerce money, there is no question about that.
It affects interstate commerce.
QUESTION:

It is a tax on his sales in interstate

commerce.
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:

It is, Mr. Justice Stewart.
Virtually every time this question comes

up it’s on something involving interstate transportation —
MR. GORTON:

It will not come up unless it is, Mr.

Chief Justice.
In International Harvester v. Department of Treasury
at 322 U.S, 340, some 30 years ago, this Court dealing with
an Indiana gross receipts tax conceptually indistinguishable
from Washington tax involved here said, and I’m quoting now,
“In this case as in sales tax cases, the taxable transaction
is at the final stage of an interstate movement," which I tnink
answers your question, Mr. Justice Stewart, “and the taxes
on the gross receipts from an interstate transaction.

In form

the use tax is different, but we recognise the sales tax and
the use tax had no different effect upon interstate commerce.
There is the same practical equivalence whether the tax is
on the selling or the buying phase of the transaction.

Each

lit substance is an imposition of a tax on the transfer of
property.

.In light of our recent decisions it could hardly

be held that Indiana lacked constittuional authority to impose

31
a sales tax or use tax on these transactions? but if that is
true? a constitutional difference is not apparent when a gross
receipts tax is utilized instead.”
In every case in this Court involving a gross
receipts tax based on sa3.es transactions for more than 40
years? the result has been totally consistent with your
contemporary sales tax decisions,

both

when the gross receipts

tax was upheld and when it was struck down.

Perhaps it is

time to recognize that the concept behind the two taxes
are identical and that for the ease of both judicial and tax
administration? it is appropriate to treat them identically
reaffirming International Harvester.

Once the destination

State has demonstrated a sufficient presence of the seller
within its borders and a sufficient connection between that
presence and the transaction

it seeks to tax to meet the

jurisdictional requirements of due process? it is as fair to
permit it to base its tax on the entire gross receipts of the
sale as it is to permit it to levy a sales or use tax on that
same measure, the entire proceeds of the sale.

It is as

completely free from the possibility of multiple taxation by
reason of your consistent prohibition of a similar tax on the
part of the State of origin.

A sales transaction, after all,

can only be consummated by delivery to the buyer, and that
can occur in only one State, the destination State.
QUESTION:

Your answer to the commerce aspect of

32
the thing ass opposed to due process aspect is not apportion­
ment , but to limit the levy to the State of destination.
MR. GORTON;

Precisely, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and

I don’t think I am making a new proposal.

It's totally

consistent with what this Court has always held in fact
whatever its theoretical discussions of apportionment.
The problem of multiple taxation which leads to the
consideration of apportionment is not solved by a higher
jurisdictional threshold.

No matter how high you set that

threshold, some of the activities causing consideration of
apportionment will have taken place in the State of origin.
The solution is not apportionment, nor a high jurisdictional
threshold, but a preference in all cases for the destination
State.
One final point on the subject of multiple taxation.
In his dissent in General Motors Mr. Justice Goldberg
expressed concern that if the State of origin had a tax
pattern identical to that of the State of Washington, the
State of origin would levy a gross receipts tax on the
manufacturing process while Washington would levy a gross
receipts tax on the wholesaling function, both taxes measured
by the sales price.
In contrast, where both of the functions confined
to Washington State, only one of the two taxes would be
imposed because Washington

.exempts from the manufacturing tax

33

those goods which are subject to the wholesaling tax.

The

vice of the system described by Mr. G'ustice Goldberg is best
understood in terms of discrimination against interstate
commerce rather than multiple taxation.

The system treats

the manufacturing and wholesaling processes as a single
activity with the imposition of a single tax if both processes
are confined to one State.

But the system does not treat both

processes as a single taxable activity if they are split
between two States.
The State's statutory policy of otherwise permissible
pyramiding of the tax is not extended evenhandedly to both
local and interstate business.

But this system does not

exist in fact in Washington State.

Our gross receipts tax

statute exempts transactions , the taxation of which would
violate constitutional standards.

It is the position of my

office to which the Department of Revenue accedes, that the
system described by Mr. Justice Goldberg would be unconstitu­
tional were it applied to any actual case.

Our statute would

thus eliminate from the tax base wholesaling transactions
consummated in Washington if the seller’s manufacturing
process had been subjected to a valid gross receipts tax
in another State.
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:

Do you have a net income tax, too?
We do not have a net income tax.

Standard here has not established either the risk or

34
actuality of multiple taxation, not because of the negligence
of the officers or attorneys, but because there was no such
risk or actuality.

Under your decision, neither Pennsylvania

nor California could have levied a tax on the wholesaling
transaction.

Neither of the States has attempted to do so

on the manufacturing process.

Standard seeks here purely and

simply an exemption from all taxation on its Washington
business transactions.

Such an exemption would be unsound in

policy as it would grant Standard’s commerce a free ride,
freedom from its fair share of the burden of government, thus
either limiting the ability of the government of the State of
Washington to provide the blessings of civilised government to
everyone utilizing the facilities of the State, including
Standard, and including its resident sales engineer, or casting
an undue burden on other taxpayers.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Gorton, you have

about nine minutes left altogether.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SLADE GORTON
ON BEHALF OF APPELLES
MR, GORTON:
it please the Courts

(continued)

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may
To return very briefly to one of the

two principal questions involved in this case, that of the
necessary threshold or amount of activities within the State
to justify any form of taxation whatsoever, I discussed this
morning the proposition that the actual activities of Standard
within the State of Washington exceeded in their relationships
to its business in the State those of either General Motors
or Norton.
I also pointed out the very close parallel in your
previous decisions between cases dealing with sales taxes and
those dealing with gross receipts taxes.

In that respect the

most significant case which is not cited in our brief,
?

regrettably, is MeGoIdrick v, DuGrenier at 309 U.S. 70 in
1940 in which a sales tax was allowed to be imposed on an
out-ofi-State company which did an exclusively interstate
business in Nev? York City through, not a resident, but a
general agent, shipping all of its goods on which the taxes
were levied in interstate commerce directly to the purchaser

36
without the general agents having had anything to do with them.
Secondly, in connection with this threshold matter
was the question asked of my brother about the applicability
or relativity of the drummer cases, such as Nippert v. Richmond
and Memphis Steam Laundry.

Whatever may have been the case

in the 19th century and the early 20th century, those two
cases, the only recent cases on drummers, deal in one case
with an out-of-state laundry which was subjected in terms to
a. far greater tax burden, quite specifically simply because
it was frora out of State, than was its in-State competition.
In Nippert the tax was a flat license fee in large
part V7ith no relation to the amount of business done which
the Court determined would certainly hit sporadic solicitation
harder than full-time resident solicitation, and in addition
was subject to repetition in every community in the State.
Also, of course, all of the solicitors in both of those cases
■were itinerant, each of which identifies it from the case we
have here.
Finally, Mr. Justice Blackmun asked my brother
whether there was an acceptable method of apportionment in
this case, and I believe the answer was none of which he
knew.

I don't believe that he was giving away anything in

connection with that acknowledgement as that was one of the
questions which very seriously troubled Mr. Justice Goldberg
in his dissent from General Motors where he said that the

3?
attempt to determine the fairness of an interstate sales
tax of a given percentage imposed on given activities in one
State would be almost as -unseemly as an attempt to determine
whether that same tax was fairly apportioned in light of
taxes levied on the same transactions by other States.

The

infinite variety of factual configurations would readily
frustrate the usual process of clarification through judicial
exclusion and inclusion.
QUESTION:

The McGoldrick case was long before

Norton and Norton specifically cited McGoldrick as being
quite distinguishabler and I'm not sure McGoldrick is of much
help to you.
MR. GORTON:

McGoldrick was of help to us# the

particular McGoldrick case.

There were more than one.

Thera

were three cases in which the McGoldrick name appears.

QUESTION:

McGoldrick was cited in Norton as

dictating a different result than the Court arrived at in
Norton.

Norton said not so, the McGoldrick type case is not

controlling here.

Now, you can call that dicta if you want to.

MR. GORTON:

In any event, our case can be validly

based on either McGoldrick or on the actual findings in Horton,
It doesn't matter which or whether or not they are
distinguishable because both of them are consistent with
taxability in the case which we have here before you.
The problem it seems to me that Mr. Justice Goldberg
brought up in the General. Motors case is that this Court finds
it very difficult to state, if not impossible, in connection
with individual controversies, to state a rule dealing with
apportionment that's all-inclusive, unlike the Congress which
perhaps could operate in this area had it chosen to do so.
The solution to Mr. Justice Goldberg's dilemma is
not infinitely to increase the jurisdictional threshold, not
to require an apportionment which never seems to meet the

40
actual circumstances of the case, but simply to follow the
conclusions to which you have previously come that the destina­
tion State will be preferred.

That prevents multiple taxation

as well as apportionment does, but it serves another goal.
Apportionment tends to increase the area which will evade
taxation entirely.

A preference for the destination State,

however far you wish to carry it, tends to narrow that and
to follow your oft-expressed doctrine that interstate
commerce should carry its fair share of the load.
One other point which was brought up earlier today,
only by inference, is the proposition that one of these other
States might in theory at least have an income tax and whether
or not we should not he required to apportion our gross
receipts tax by reason of that income tax.
Now, that should be required only to the extent
that every sales and gross receipts tax case which you have
sustained since Berwind-White, McGoldrick v- Berwind-White,
should require similar apportionment.

The gross receipts tax

on retail sales from the local store in Norton, for example,
which everyone, including the taxpayer,assumed was valid,
included in its measure incidence of value attributable to
activities in the State of origin.

The Sears Roebuck store

in Seattle, Washington,collects a sales tax on every retail
sale based on its entire sales price, even though much of
that price was created by a manufacturing process in another

41
Stats which subjects Sears to a net income tax in that State.
You have never purported to require apportionment of a sales
tax.

Since these taxes under International Harvestar are

conceptually and as a matter of fact factually the same, there
should be no requirement here when the problem can so easily
be solved by simply following your prior decision preferring
the destination State.

Thank you, Mr. Attorney

General.
Mr. Cornell, you have a few minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH L. CORNELL
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. CORNELL:

Thank you.

Concerning the Attorney General's approach favoring
the destination State and not allowing the market State to
tax would avoid multiple taxation to me is incredible.

He

talks about a State being able to exact their fair share.
The State of Washington here wants their share plus Pennsyl­
vania's and California's.

Sales activity occurs there.

What he is saying is that in those States Standard Pressed
Steel should not have, to pay its fair share, the gross receipts
tax cannot apply.
To me, this flies in the face of the doctrine that
interstate commerce must pay its own way.
QUESTION?

You lost me there a little bit with the

42
multiple taxation,
MR, CORNELL:

Welly the Attorney General's position

is to avoid the risk of multiple taxation in cases such as
this where you have activities occurring in two States from
which the gross receipts are derived, that the easy solution
is to give the destination State the ability to tax and deny
the market State —
QUESTION:

You don't claim that there's a tax in

any other State on this same transaction, do you?
MR. CORNELL:
the ability to tax.

No, I do not.

I am talking now about

I believe that if Pennsylvania or

California wanted to impose such a tax, that they could.
QUESTION:

In addition to the one imposed now by

Washington.
MR. CORNELLs
QUESTION:

Yes,

You don't think there is any barrier to

that in the decided cases?
MR. CORNELL:

No, I do not.

The cases cited for

that proposition or the taxes struck down there or struck
down because of the failure to properly apportion between the
destination State and the market State.
QUESTION:

Well, surely, neither Pennsylvania or

California could tax as such the gross receipts on wholesale
sales made by your client in the State of Washington.

They

might be able to impose a general income tax, or excise taxes,

43
or other taxes, but they couldn’t tax as such and exclusively,
could they, the gross receipts of wholesale sales reads by
Standard Pressed Steel Company in the State of Washington.
MR. CORNELL:

I believe they can, your Honor, and I

hesitate to differ, but on the other hand, the Evco v. Jones
case where I pointed out the quote from Adams Manufacturing
Company v. Storen, that quote pointed out that the problem -with a
honapportioned gross receipts tax and the reason that tax was
struck down is not something to do with destination State
versus market State, but rather the tax was not fairly
apportioned between those States.

There does seem to be a

coincidence in several of the cases that the market State
has not been allowed to impose a nonapportioned gross receive?
tax.

But I believe that's a mere concidence.

On the basis

of those decisions, I think that clearly, pointing out the
apportionment, both States do have the right.
QUESTION:

If your client maintained a warehouse

in the State and made sales out of the warehouse?
MR. CORNELL:
QUESTION:

No.

I know, but if it did, would you object

to this particular gross receipts tax?
MR. CORNELL:

That would be a much different case.

I think that would involve ~
QUESTION:

I know, but your apportionment argument

ought to be much the same.

44
MR. CORNELL;

The apportionment argument would be

much the same.
QUESTION;

But you really wouldn't make it# would you?

MR. CORNELL;

It would depend on how much activity

occurs outside of the taxing State in relation to the activity
occurring within the taxing State.
QUESTION;

Mr. Cornell, do you think Washington could

have levied a use tax on Boeing on the screws and fasteners
that they bought from your client?
MR. CORNELL;

Well, the use does take place within

the State, and I believe that is — for example, the sales
tax cases xnake it very clear that there can be no burden of
multiple taxation because the sale takes place in a particular
State, and I believe it was Mlppert v. Richmond where that was
a very key fact.

Where did the sale take place?

State that can impose the sales tax.

That's the

And in the use tax case

the same inquiry would be made and the same governing factor
wo~ld have to be present.
QUESTION;

Where is the use?

So What do you think in this case?

MR. CORNELL;

I think since the use takes place in

the State of Washington, the State of Washington could impose
a use tax.
