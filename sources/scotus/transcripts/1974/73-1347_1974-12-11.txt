PROCEEDINGS.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

next in Wo. 73-1347, Board of School Commissioners against
Jacobs.
Mrs. Young.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LILA J. YOUNG
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MRS. YOUNG:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice,, and may it please

I'm Mrs. Young, attorney for the petitioners,

Indianapolis School Board, in this case.
The plaintiffs were high school students in the
Indianapolis public schools, all minors, and they filed a
class action for declaratory injunctive relief as well as
damages against the Indianapolis School Board because school
authorities said they could neither distribute nor sell in
the Indianapolis schools a newspaper entitled the "Corn
Cob

Curtain."
We had two board rules at/chat time, both requiring

prior approval for sale and for distribution of literature at
schools.

Approval was not given for the sale or distribution

of the Corn Cob Curtain because it contains defamatory,
obscene language.
QUESTION:

Was the approval not given after

distribution of the first issue?
MRS. YOUNG:

No, it was not the first issue.

There

4
had been several issues distributed*, both in and outside of the
school.

Actually not very many copies had been distributed

inside any of the high schools.

There were two high schools

at which some distribution had taken place.
QUESTIONS
MRS. YOUNG:

There were five issues involved?
There were five issues over a period

of a little over four months.
QUESTION:

And it was after the publication of the

fifth issue that its approval was not given?
MRS. YOUNG:
QUESTION:
MRS. YOUNG:

By the superintendent, that's correct.
In what form was his approval not given?
Well, there had been soras discussion

with the high school administrators„

They got together with

the superintendent, and at that time he asked for copies and
said it obtained obscene language and he could not give
approval to the distribution of this in the school because he
felt it was the duty of the school officials to discourage and
prevent the use of this language by children in school.
QUESTION:
MRS. YOUNG:
QUESTION:
MRS. YOUNG:

Is this publication still being published?
No, it is not.
When was it discontinued?
Shortly after the decision in this case.

There were a few copies distributed at a couple high schools
or outside of those high schools after the decision, but the
Corn Cob Curtain is no longer in existence.

5
QUESTION:

Were any penalties imposed on the

plaintiffs?
MRS. YOUNG %
QUESTION:

Absolutely none.
What interest remains?

What's alive in

this case .today?
MRS. YOUNG:

There is quite a bit alive in this case..

We have submitted several sets of rules to the district court.
First of all, we amended our original rules of prior
restraint»

These rules are no longer in existence.

But the

first amendment of our rules added procedural and substantive
safeguards to these rules, but the district court said he
could not give any approval to any form of prior restraint.
So at that time he ordered us to again amend our rules which
we did.
Our second amendment of our rules contained only
subsequent restraint, and we had quite a few of those.

The

district court also declared those facially unconstitutional.
He entered a permanent injunction against us, as well as
declaring these rules facially unconstitutional, and this
injunction was upheld in its entirety by the Seventh Circuit.
So we have a permanent injunction against us.

We also have a

complete inability to have any rules or regulations of what
is going to be distributed in our schools.

So this issue is

very much alive, even though the Corn Cob Curtain as a
particular newspaper is no longer in existence.

6
QUESTION 5

Do I remember correctly that the

publishers of the paper have graduated now from the school
system?
MRS. YOUNG;

I think virtually all of them have, of

this particular paper.
There are basically five issues presented to this
Court today.

One is the validity of our rule of prior

restraint, the rules adding the substantive and procedural
safeguards that were suggested by the other circuits which
had approved the principle of prior review of student
literature prior to distribution in schools.

Two of the issues

concern the validity of our rules of subsequent restraint
and whether the Court'

of Appealserroneously applied principles

in declaring these rules facially void,
A fourth issue is whether the district court errs
in his complete refusal to apply the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure 17 (c) simply because the instant plaintiffs in this
case had raised a constitutional issue.

So he totally ignored

the mandate of that rule.
The fifth issue, which I plan to emphasise here
today, is whether elementary and high schools can either
prevent or discipline students who use gutter language in our
elementary and high schools.

Since we all know what these

words are and they are printed in the appendix, I will prefer
not to repeat them here today.

They involve more than words;

they involve phrases and filthy cartoons.
Nov;, it's your decision whether or not children
will be using gutter language in our elementary and high
schools.

If you decide that school officials can neither

prevent nor discipline students who use this language in
school, then many basic functions of our schools will be
destroyed.

One of these basic functions is to teach children

how to use language properly and in socially acceptable terms.
Nov;, this cannot be taught in our schools, and it will not be
taught, if you decide that the school officials can do nothing
about it and the students in our school say, well, it's O.K.
for us to write and distribute this language because the
Supreme. Court says it's fine.
Now, a lot of time could be spent discussing ttfhat
label we might attach to these, x^ords, whether they should be
classified as legally obscene

as to minors or ns indecent.

But the classification or label attached to this filth doesn't
change the fact that it belongs in the gutter and not in our
schoolhouses.

Now, it's either right or wrong for children

to be using and distributing this language in our schools.
And if it's wrong, then our school officials should be able
to do something about it.

It seems incredible that the right

to control the use of this language in our schools should even

beyquestioned, let alone denied.
Cur briefs discuss many harmful consequences of

3

allowing -this type of language to .be spread throughout our
elementary and high schools.
QUESTION;

I have the impression that this just

involves high schools.
MRS. YOUNG;
schools.

No, it definitely involves elementary

Our rules definitely cover all the Indianapolis

public schools, and there are some 114 elementary schools as
well as 11 high schools.
Now, the plaintiffs were high school students.

Two

of them before the action had been commenced, before the
complaint was filed, had actually graduated, but they were
high school students.

They had actually distributed only in

two or around two high schools.

But the injunction covers

and clearly covers the elementary sphools.
cover the elementary schools.
elementary schools.

The rules clearly

Our brief and everything covers

We don't have separate rules for grade

school children and high school children.
QUESTION;

Do your colleagues on the other side

agree?
MRS. YOUNG;

At no time did they deny that these

rules in the case involved only high schools, until we got
up to the Seventh Circuit.

And there, in response to questions

by one of the Justices, they stated these rules apply only to
high schools.

But they do not.

And the court's opinion, the

district court's opinion, clearly is applicable as well as

9
the injunction is applicable to grade school students,
QUESTION:

One of the bases of Judge Christensen's

dissent in the Seventh Circuit, wasn't it, was that the
majority failed to distinguish,, in its opinion, between
>

application to high schools and application to elementary
schools?
MRS, YOUNG:

That's correct.

However, since the

injunction was upheld in its entirety,, it’s very clear that
we cannot apply these rules to elementary students.
rules were declared facially void, null and void.

The
It would

be bad faith for us to say, well, even though they specifically
covered ail the schools that we can go now and apply them to
the grade schools.
QUESTION:

Is there anything in these papers that

could have led a reasonably careful reader to get the
impression that only high schools were involved?
MRS. YOUNG:

I doubt that because if you look even

in ~~
QUESTION:
MRS. YQUNG:

That53 not the claim of your adversary?
They claim that for the first .time at the

oral argument, but they never claimed that and they never
denied the fact that the elementary students were involved
when we were down in the lower courts.
QUESTION:
MRS. YOUNG:

How about here?

Is there anything --

I am certain they will probably claim

10

it hare.
QUESTION:

And in their briefs and petition.

MRS. YOUNG:

Right.

But if you look at the

transcript ~
QUESTION:

Then a reasonably careful or prudent

reader might have gotten that impression.
MRS. YOUNG:

I would disagree with that because there

are many references to elementary schools.

Their very

complaint
QUESTION;

I mean the impression that the claim

has made.
MRS. YOUNG:
QUESTION:

Impression

that the —

That the claim is made by your adversaries

that these rules apply to high schools and they are only
talking about high schools.
Well, wa will see what they say.
MRS. YOUNG:

But I just —

I don’t believe they claim: that the

injunction —
QUESTION:

I may have a misapprehension in that.

MRS. YOUNG:

I don’t think that they are claiming

that the injunction or the rules apply only to or govern
only high schools.

I think their argument basically is that

the class consisted only of high school students.

But the

students made it clear right in the evidentiary hearing that
they planned to distribute this newspaper not only to high

Ii
school students, but to anyone else.

And the relief sought

was not confined solely to high schools.
QUESTION:

Who were the plaintiffs of the class

complaint?
MRS. YOUNG:
QUESTION:

They are ~~ who are remaining plaintiffs?
No, in the complaint.

It was a class

action, wasn't it?
MRS. YOUNG:

Right.

There were six named plaintiffs.

Only two remain at the end of the case because the rest, had
graduated.
QUESTION:
MRS. YOUNG:

And now those two have graduated.
I'm not completely sure, but I think

that's probably true.
QUESTION:

V?as there a declaration of certification

of class action?
MRS. YOUNG:
QUESTION:
MRS. YOUNG s

Yes.
And what was the class?
The class was the high school students

in the Indianapolis public schools.

The relief sought

governed more than the high school students: it involved our
suppression of distribution anywhere in the Indianapolis
public schools.
As I said, the issue I wish to emphasise here today
is the issue on the type of language and the basic reason for
suppressing this distribution.

If this Court decides that

12

minors may not be disciplined for using this language in
school, how can it consistently justify its own rules in the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that permit adult attorneys
to be disciplined for inserting scandalous and indecent
material in their briefs and pleadings?

Surely the school

officials have as much right to maintain a basic level of
decency and a proper atmosphere in our schools so that learning
can take place.

An academic atmosphere is no less important

in our schools than it is in our courts.

And if respect and

decency is destroyed in our schools, then it won't last much
longer in the courtroom or anywhere else.
In balancing the public interest or the students*
interest in expression against the many harmful consequences
that we have stated in our brief and the justification for
the regulation of this type of filth in our schools, I think
the scales are very unevenly balanced.

In fact, what possible

value or benefit could be derived by permitting children to
use and distribute this type of four-letter words and filth
in our elementary and secondary schools?
Respondents argue that not every article is filthy
and that the words are not used too many times.

But if

the

number of times obscenities are used is to be the criterion
for regulation in the schoolhouse, then this would ba in effect
telling children that it's O.K. to use these words just so
long as you don't use them too many times.

13
QUESTION;

Mrs. Young, I suppose you are going to

get to what the minimum safeguards are tb.at you think the
board is entitled to impose in order to achieve what you think
they should be able to achieve.
MRS, YOUNG;
approaching this.

Well, I think there are two ways of

We originally approached .it and we would

like to still continue to approach it with a prior review of
student literature in order to take -QUESTION;

Would that go to each publication or

would they apply to you and say, "We want to put out a paper
*

and please give us permission."
MRS, YOUNG:
of prior review.

The procedures are set out in our rule

They would submit material that they desire

%

to have a general distribution of in the school house .

We have

procedural safeguards set out —
QUESTION;
MRS. YOUNG:

That would be each issue, then?
That would be correct, each issue.

And if filth and four-letter words were used in the publication,
then the school officials would say that they do not think
this is proper language to use and they would not allow the
distribution unless that language would be removed.

That’s

the issue of prior restraint.
QUESTION:

Nov?, suppose the authorities just didn’t

agree with what was said.
MRS, YOUNG:

There would be no regulation.

14
QUESTION:

Besides — what if there was criticism

the way the school was run?
MRS» YOUNG:

The rule specifically provides for allow­

ing responsible criticism.
QUESTION:

It is stated right in the rules.

What is responsible?

MRS. YOUNG:
QUESTION:

Who decides that?

Responsible criticism would be —
Who decides it?

MRS. YOUNG:
QUESTION:

Who decides it?

Well —

The fellow criticised?

MRS. YOUNG:

A board of review that would be set up

to look at this.
QUESTION:

It might to© itself criticised.

MRS. YOUNG:
that is correct.

Who might be criticized themselves,

Our schools are not opposed to criticism.

We receive a great deal of it, and I think they would receive a
great deal more if they didn't have any rules or control of
the conduct of the students in their schools.
QUESTION:

You think it would just be unmanageable

or just not effective if the school had the rules as to What
could be in materials that are distributed but didn't have a
pre-approval system, that you would just, if someone broke
the rules and distributed filthy language in a newspaper,
suspend them or punish them or do something.
MRS. YOUNG:

That is called for in our rules of

subsequent restraint which allow only subsequent punishment

15
after the fact.
QUESTION:

I understand.

But you apparently Insist

on wanting prior approval.
MRS. YOUNG:

Right.

We have two sets of rules.

We

would prefer prior approval.
QUESTION;

I know you prefer.

I'm trying to find out

what your position is here as to-what you are constitutionally
i

eutfi’&led to do.
MRS. YOUNG:

I think we are entitled to both sets

of rules as they have been written.
QUESTION:

And the reason you insist on the prior

review is because the subsequent approach is ineffective, or
what?
MRS. YOUNG:

I don't think it is ineffective.

think it is less effective.
students.

I

We aren’t interested in punishing

We don't like to remove them from the schools.

We are interested in teaching them to speak in socially
acceptable terms and a newspaper that they would wish to
print could be a good learning experience, but I think there
has to be certain control.

We would just like to take a peek

at it and see what's coming into our schools.

If we can't do

that* then we would like to impose subsequent restraint
because that’s all that's left to us.
QUESTION:
MRS. YOUNG:

Yes.
The subsequent restraint would not

16

necessarily be expulsion.

They range from a reprimand to

expulsion, which is a last resort.
that often.

We don't use expulsion

We try every other means first.

But we would

like to avoid punishment, and I think prior review would
set up more of a learning experience rather than waiting and
saying, "Distribut it and see what the consequences are.”
QUESTION:

But I take it either way you go that

one thing you would insist on and that is that the publishers
can't be anonymous.
MRS. YOUNG:

I think this is more important for the

rules of subsequent restraint.

X think it is absolutely

essential in that area because that is the only means for
determining who is abusing the system.

If articles are sent

in to a post office box like they were in the Corn Cob Curtain
and they will print whatever was sent in to them with
absolutely no editing, we must assume that they would allow
pornography or anything else that was sent in.
QUESTION:

Even on tine licensing approach you would

insist that only students or faculty members be allowed to
publish in the school system.
MRS. YOUNG:

I don’t believe in our rule of prior

restraint that we limit it.

We do on the anonymous part.

But we would prefer a student newspaper in either situation
to be written by students, simply because outsiders have no
right to come into the school and distribute their wares and

17
literature,, and we do not wish this basic principle to be
subverted by having children distribute it for them.

The

school is a place where many children are forced to attend.
It constitutes a large captive audience.

There are many

outsiders that are interested in reaching this captive
audience.

This is a serious problem, not only with salesmen

but with anybody who wants to reach the thousands of students
in the school.

At Tech High School,one of the schools

involved in this case, we have over 5,000 students. This is
quite a vulnerable captive audience.

So this is -why we wish

to have the school used only for educational purposes and
not for non-school purposes.
I would like to reserve .the remainder of my time
»

for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF «JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well, Mrs. Young.

Mr. Pinkus.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG ELDON PINKUS
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. PINKUS:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I would like to begin first of all, aside from

the hazards of argument, to address myself to what we regard
as the issue that Mr. Justice Stewart was inquiring about,
whether this case does indeed involve elementary students in
any way 'whatsoever.

We say most emphatically it does not

involve elementary students in any way except that the injunction

18
which was issued by the district court does indeed go to
rules which cover the entire system.
QUESTION?

Since the colloquy# I've noticed the

closing language of the Court of Appeals opinion.
MR. PIHKUS:
QUESTION:

Precisely# Mr. Justice Stewart.
Which says# "Should the defendants apply

to the district court to limit the injunction to high schools#
nothing in this decision forecloses its consideration of the
application on its merits.
MR. PINKUS:

Which is exactly what ws think they

ought to have done.
QUESTION:

Why shouldn't the petitioners — why

shouldn't they have been entitled to a reversal from the
Seventh Circuit on that point rather than simply telling them
to go back and move the district court to modify?
MR. PINKUS:

We didn’t argue that they were not

entitled to reversal.
QUESTION:

Well# then# you concede that the Court of

Appeals in the Seventh Circuit was wrong insofar as it affirmed
that portion of the district court’s injunction?
MR. PINKUS:

Well# we take the position that we have

never represented elementary students.

They have never been in

our class. They have never been involved in the evidentiary
proceedings# that we have never briefed or argued on their
behalf.

And we merely have no objection to this Court finding

19
that the Seventh Circuit was wrong insofar as it refused to
rule on elementary students.

We are here before this Court

on behalf of a class of people from 13 to 20 years old -•«

It's a sin

I would say, however, that the reason

for not presenting the Court with a tender in a temporary
restraining order form was so that it. would be possible perhaps
to arrive in some joint fashion in terms of time, place and
manner of distribution,which we endeavored to do from the
beginning of our representation in this case.
So I think we made it clear from the beginning that
we did use some broad language*

QUESTION:
MR. PINKUS%

X am not clear if it would or not.
Well, would it or not?
I would say that I can imagine under

the Ginsberg concept that a careful delineation of age groups
would be constitutional under the first amendment.

I simply

don't know how precisely those groups must be delineated.
And that's the answer that I must give you.

And we accept

the Ginsberg concept.
QUESTION:

You don't accept it down to age 13.

I

mean anything from 13 up you say is out of that.
MR. PINKUS:

No, sir.

On the contrary, We would be

pleased to live with the New York statute in Ginsberg in this
case.

We would be very pleased to have that have been in

the statute.

Agreed.

QUESTION:

But it did contain —*

MR. PINKUS:

No, I mean that it contains some

Yes.

MR. PINKUS:

for certiorari, 1,1.1 says "obscene".

MR. PINKUS:

No, sir.

I'm talking specificity in

light of the Court's newer and related cases,
QUESTION:

Let’s assume that the board eliminated

all — well, didn't eliminate the prohibition of obscenity,
but it added something that says,

In these papers you will

not use the following words#and listed them, and no others
of the same kind.

Now, what about some of the four-letter

word3 you think the school board is not entitled in high school
to forbid the use of those words in a newspaper.
MR. PINKUS:

Yes.

Sir, I believe they are not

entitled to forbid any of the words they are complaining about
before tills Court in high school publications per se, and I
want to make it clear they have focused upon words —
QUESTION:

You mean, Mr. Pirxkns, that .

as far as

they can go constitutionally is to prohibit only that which
by constitutional definition is obscene?
MR. PINKUS:

I think that they can fashion an

22
obscenity rule with respect to the age group involved that is
more restrictive than the rule that would apply to adults.
QUESTION;

But may not go so far as to prohibit the

use of specific words.
MR. PINKUS;

Regardless of context.

point —

Why would a rule like that be unconstitu­

MR. PINKUS:

No, sir.

But I'm attempting to

respond to the board's argument.

The board has characterized

The Corn Cob Curtain as an obscene publication.
simply no question about that.
to their argument.

There is

And I am attempting to respond

I am glad to agree with any of the

Justices that obscenity is not properly before this Court.
>

It is our position that there is nothing obscene about the
Corn Cob Curtain under any standards, and that's what I meant
when X was saying I would be glad to apply the Ginsberg type
definitions.
QUESTION:

You go further and say that since there

is nothing obscene, even variably obscene under Ginsberg, the
school board can't prohibit the use of particular Specified
words that are just regarded as being in very bad taste in
public conversation around the dinner table.
MR. PINKUS:

That is correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

That is our position.
QUESTION:

What is your*basis — what case should

this Court rely on'for that?
MR. PINKUS:

Well, we think that in the sense that

the question on this issue is whether a public high school is
more like a jail or the United States Army with Parker and
Adderley in mind, which has been relied upon by the board, or is
more like a university in Papiah.

Now, we think that the

principal matter that we would like to argue about the position

26
of these words per se — and I urge the Justices and the
Court to read these publications because they are so infrequent.
QUESTION:

I think you can assume that we have

read them.
MR. PINKUS:
QUESTION:
hypothetical.

Yes.
Now, what is your answer to Mrs. Young’s

If she hadn’t raised it, I would have.

Do you

concede that this Court has the power to proscribe language
that is used in this courtroom?
MR. PINKUS:
QUESTION:

I do, and I heard —
So, then, do you contend that a court

has greater control of the speech of

mature lawyers than a

school does over the speech of teenagers?
MR. PINKUS:

I think they are much different

environments, and I think — I heard language here from Mr,
Clancy yesterday in the Pursue, Ltd. case

that

undoubtedly would have been equally as objectionable if it
had been contained in the Corn Cob Curtain, which it was not.
I think the context is the very vital thing.
QUESTION:

The difference is that he was using it

because he was repeating it out of the record in a case
before the Court.

There may have been some question about

his good taste in judgment in using it instead of letting us
read it, but he wasn't using that language in the sense
Mr. Justice Blackmun is talking about.

27

MR. PINKUS:

Well, sir, I am arguing that context

is extremely vital and that to simply pick out the words and
say this word is always inappropriate in a student publication
goes very, very far beyond what the first amendment should be
permitted to tolerate.
X would like to stress that we have quite a double
standard.

These words are in dictionaries, they are in the

New York Times, they are in the Wall
comments from Presidential tapes.

Street Journal, reporting

These words are in novels

that are in the libraries of our schools like Catcher in the
Rye.

All of this is conceded.

And we don't understand why

if these words appear in a completely non-erotic

context but

they are in a non-official student publication H at they must
be proscribed when they are in the dictionaries, in the
newspapers and magazines and books.
QUESTION:

That's our position.

You wouldn’t carry it over to elementary

schools.
MR. PINKUS:

Well, I really don't know the position

on that, Justice Rehnquist, because quite frankly I've never
dealt with the elementary school context in this litigation
and I incidentally —
QUESTION:
MR. PINKUS:

You had an order that covered it.
Yes, and we continue to agree that we

would be willing to have that limited.
to argue the elementary context.

We are not prepared

28
I would like to xnake a point about, maturity.

There

is some reason, I think, reading the Court’s opinion in
Wisconsin v. Yoder, footnote 15 pointed out the fact there
that we still hate many States in this nation where eighth
grade education is the final grade that is required, that
people of the age that begins high school can be excused in
several States, and that footnote notes that Indiana is one
of those States.

In Indiana a person who is a freshman in

high school can be excused to go to work.

So we recognise

that there is a dividing line there, and we think the State's
labor scheme recognizes a dividing line there.

We are simply

not prepared to say what . .the standards ought to be for people
‘ *

below that dividing line.

«

We are here only dealing with

people who are above that dividing line.

And we’ve tried a.h

carefully as possible to limit our actions.
QUESTION;

What

A little while ago you spoke about age 13, which is the seventh
grade normally.

Are you speaking to junior high, now?

MR. PINKUS:

No, sir.

I was quoting the testimony

from now Superintendent Kalp when he was characterizing the
age range attending the high schools in Indianapolis, Indiana.
And he stated that the age range was from 13 to 20.

And that

is at page 47A.
QUESTION;
13 to 20.

That is the scope of your submission,

29

MR. PINKOSs
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
So put another way, it's from the ninth

through the twelfth grades.
MR. PINKUS:

Yes, sir.

To the extent that I

indicated that 14 was the cut-off, I would grant that there
may be one confused year in there, but we are talking about
the elementary versus the high school student.
QUESTION:

Did you take the position before the

Court of Appeals that the Ginsberg approach to obscenity for
younger people survive Miller?
MR. PINKUS:
QUESTION:
to think so, did it?

Yes.
Well, the Court of Appeals didn't seem
They seemed to think that the rules were

bad because, they didn't specify the conduct stated in Miller.
They wouldn't have to if Ginsberg survives.

case relied upon pre-existing -—

rights can't be interfered with.

MR. PINKUS:

No, it does not, and it should be

should be narrowed, and I agreed before the trial court that

I5d like to briefly respond to the question earlier,
the citation to Ginsberg in the Seventh Circuit's opinion is
at 29A of the opinion which is found in trie petition for the
writ of certiorari’s appendix, and there,Mr. Justice White, they
do quote,the top paragraph, they 'say they don’t have to
speculate about the exact effect of Miller on the variable
obscenity concept by Ginsberg, and then they go on to say what
is really our —
QUESTION;

(Inaudible)

MR, PINKUS:

Well, I think their point is that no

matter what kind of names we use, we are not talking about
obscenity here? we are talking about words that bother some
people in some context.
QUESTION:

We are talking about, vulgarity, perhaps.

But there is -— implicit in that paragraph

of the Seventh Circuit’s opinion certainly is the notion taut
Miller covered all aspects of obscenity and that if you can* t
tie Ginsberg into the language of Miller as written, Ginsberg
didn’t survive, don’t you think?
MR. PINKUS:

I think that that’s quite possible, Mr.

Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

Meaning you think they are wrong, don't

you?
MR. PINKUS:

Yes,

We do not say that Ginsberg should

32

be abandoned, as I have tried to make clear.

We are not

arguing that position.
And I'd like to point out that the students who put
this out have never argued that.

The front page of the second

issue of the Corn Cob Curtain is an article on student rights
and it says, "Freedom of the press and the right of petition,
the right to distribute circulars and publications on campus
so long as there is no interference with school work or the
rights of others and provided that the publication is not
libelous or obscene."

They printed this on their publication

months before anyone told them to stop distributing it.
it's been our position all along.

And

We don't feel that

pornography is necessarily something that can be distributed
to minors, and we think Ginsberg still viable.
I'd like to add a couple of notes to the facts in
this case.

The discussions of the administrators that led to

the statement that this publication could not be distributed
were inaugurated by Jeff Jacobs, one of the student plaintiffs.
He heard an announcement over the public address system which
put a doubt in his mind about vdiefcher he was entitled to
distribute this.

There is evidence in the record that he

had previously talked to the vice principal, Mr. Wally Potter
who said, well, he just didn't know for sura whether they
could or not, but he didn't want to over-react to the situation,
and in the appendix is his testimony that he knowingly permitted

33
distribution of this publication in the high schools until
the time that this young man, Jeff Jacobs, called the
superintendent's office and said, “1 heard an announcement
over the public address system.:
distribute the publication?"

Does it mean that I can't

I think the Court should know

that we are dealing with people who tried to resolve this
matter lawfully, and that from the day he heard that announcemeat on the public address system until the day the Court
issued its injunction, this publication was suspended entirely.
QUESTION:

Could I ask you a question?

Suppose the

board had a rule that by any definition of obscenity or
bannable words you would agree described what could be banned
clearly and you would think they could be banned.

I take

it your position is that even so the board must wait until
the publication

has occurred.

MR. PINKUS:
QUESTION:

Precisely,
And that the board may not say, "I want

to check on this distribution here before it goes out to make
sure that this

bannable material is not in*the paper.

MR. PINKUS:
QUESTION:

Precisely.

Precisely.

And you think that rule against prior

restraint would apply right across the board in high school.
MR. PINKUS:
QUESTION:
MR. PINKUS:

Yes, that is our position,
And you also insist on anonymity.
No.

We think that -- I would like to

34
make two points on that.

First, the anonymity rule if read

carefully is superfluous, because under their definitions
once you get down to what’s distributable, it can’t be libelous,
it can't be obscene.

So the justification for anonymity is

gone since there theoretically will be no libel actions and
no obscenity prosecution.
QUESTION;

Oh, X don’t know.

There are a lot of

pebple who might like to criticize the. school authorities
without being known who they are, like to tell some teachers
they are very bad, and they wouldn’t like to know, especially
if it was a member of that class, wouldn't like to know who’s
talking.
MR. PINKUS:

We think that's a valuable right

which should be protected and that high school journalism is
not so different from grown-up journalism, if you will, that
the New York Times is to be treated differently to the extent
thatprior restraints against its publications bear an extremely
heavy constitutional burden, whereas they don't here.
X would like to mention on this matter of criticism,
Justice White, at page 53A and following is the allegedly
defamatory article about the football coach at Tech High School.
Now, Jeff Jacobs himself was a football player of that high
school and I'd like — 53A of the appendix, the beige bound
document.

This did contain some criticism, but it's criticism,

to my mind, of the most mild and, if you will, school spirited

35
variety. At the bottom of the first paragraph, for example,
the student writer says, "When X was a freshman X wanted to
prove them wrong»

Mr. Kootz, assistant football coach last

year, really put pride in me taught me the meaning.

I really

loved him for this but all he has taught ma has been torn down

by the coaches this year."

Continuing on to 54A, the student

writer says, "I was wrong.

It took me four years to learn

that I, and anybody thinking they are over the coaches head,
are dead wrong."
QUESTION:
MR. PINKOS;

beginning, "I was wrong.

The sentence

It took me four years to learn,”

And then, here is what I take to be th® allegedly defamatory
material.

"They say that th® coaches do not play the right

people, he*s prejudiced, he’s outdated, and he's pigheaded.
They might even say he is inhuman.

Well this may all be

slightly true except the latter”

and they spelled it wrong.

"If he makes these mistakes he’s nothing but human.
athletes should realise this.

The

I am not saying they are

entirely wrong but that they, by arguing who is right and
wrong, are destroying Tech's Athletic Program."

And the whole

36
thrust of these articles is that

a school with 5,000 students

ought to have the best football team in Indiana, because it’s
the biggest school in Indiana.

And they can’t understand why

they used to have good football teams but they don’t have
good football teams any more.
Now, I don’t think there is anything defamatory
in there, and if these articles are read, they convey a
concept of concern, of interest in having the football team
perform better on the field, then there is a lot of very,
positive talk in here.

And that’s the tenor of this publica­

tion.

QUESTION:
MS. PINKUSs

No, not until this -I hope not.
Not until this whole matter began.

In

fact, Mr. Justice Brennan# the evidence shows that Karl Kalp,
the superintendent, did not even know what the Corn Cob Curtain
was until the day Jeff Jacobs got through to him on the
telephone and asked, "May we distribute this publication?"
And it had been distributed through the fifth issue.

And I'd

like to make clear that they only distributed 200 out of the
fifth issue, and. they printed approximately 3,000.

Pie was the principal

of the school.
MR. PIMKUS:

No, sir.

Karl Kalp was, at the time

Jeff Jacobs called him, the assistant principal of the
Indianapolis Public School System.
QUESTION:

Why should an assistant principal of the

whole system know whether a paper is being published in a
particular school?
MR. PINKUS:

Well, the record described that it was

his job to keep track of these things, and he submitted
numerous exhibits that showed various publications that he
had! prohibited.

Furthermore, the rule that we originally

litigated against said there shall be no distribution without
the express prior approval of the general superintendent.
The general superintendent had delegated this job to his
assistant superintendent, Mr. Kalp, who is now the general
superintendent of the school system.

So it was his job, that’s

his testimony.
QUESTION:

You’ve used a couple words kind of

interchangeably, it seems to ms, or perhaps I'm just —*
Is it fair to say that generally the principal, an assistant
principal are associated with individual high schools and the
superintendent and assistant superintendent are associated
with the school system as a whole?

39

MR. PXHKUS:
QUESTION:

That1s correct.
You have used them so interchangeably is

why it!s confusing,
MR. PINKUS:

I appreciate that.

I trust that it's

now clear.
QUESTION:

I take it from what you have been saying

that you would agree that it would be appropriate for a school
board to have some ru3.es covering this area.

As I understand

your position, you visualize the first amendment as having
three levels of application, one to people who are out of
high school and above 20, one to people who are in high school,
between 13 and 20, and the third application of the first
amendment to people who are net in high school and who are
under 13.

We are talking about the high school intermediate

level first amendment application.

If you were the superin­

tendent of schools, what recoxnmendation would you make to the
school board as to rules that would be constitutional?
MR. PXNKUSs

I would recommend an adoption of rules

oh the prohibition of obscenities, and I think I would be
inclined to draw heavily on the definitions used in the
Ginsberg case that involve descriptions of various conditions
of nudity, descriptions of sexual acts in a degree of detail,
none of which we have here.

We only have one phrase that

approaches that, and I would utilize that kind of an approach
which I think would be acceptable and would be within the

40
Court * s ruling in that area- Even though there would not be
immediate criminal sanctions, there would be eventual criminal
sanctions, as we have recognised, because if a person is
expelled, that person is also subject to juvenile processes,
a truant, and so on.
QUESTION:
prior consultation.

You would have no prior restraint, no
The only 1 imitation would, be on obscenity

as defined, and that definition would not be the Miller
definition, but would be closer to what was said in Ginsberg.
MR. PINKUS:

I think that's correct.

We have, never

objected to rule against material which is libelous, either.
I wish to make that clear.

I do have some doubt in my mind

about the way in which a public school would go about
enforcing any kind of remedy if there were libel because I
think it would be primarily an individual matter of vindication
of personal rights with anyone who considered himself to have
been libeled.
QUESTIONS

Would you apply the New York Times v.

Sullivan libel limitation?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LILA J. YOUNG
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MRS. YOUNG:

Thank you.

First of all, the validity of the rules on obscenity
are not an issue in this case.

The issue is whether, first

off all, this type of language is obscene as to minors, and even
if it could not be declared legally obscene as to minors,
whether we

have a right to do anything about it.

And we

have rules concerning indecent language, both prior restraint
rules and subsequent restraint rules.

We have always had them.

Also we have a juvenile delinquent statute which defines a

42
juvenile delinquent as one who uses vulgar, obscene, indecent
language.

We also have statutes that say you cannot contribute

to the delinquency of a minor.

And if we have to set aside

a time and place in our school for the distribution of this
filth, then we are contributing to the delinquency of minors.
Also, we have compulsory education under statutes until age 16

don't think we should have to list a bunch of four-letter words.

And for good reason

Also, the second crucial factor is that we are not

We are defining

what is proper conduct in the schoolhouse, not beyond the

We have no regulations concerning that.

So I question the relevancy of many of these cases that
concern the community at large and also concern criminal
matters.
We shouldn’t have to spend the time going down the
elements and having hearings and everything because we have
an inherent responsibility to provide an atmosphere where

They set generally accepted standards to be adhered to by
