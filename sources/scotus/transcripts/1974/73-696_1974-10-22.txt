MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in 73-696, Emporium Capwell Company against Western
Addition Community, and the Labor' Board's related petition.
Mr. Wallace.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G„ WALLACE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE NAT I ON.AT, LABOR RELATIONS BOARD
MR. WALLACE;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
With a possible limitation to which I shall refer in
a moment, the question decided by the National Labor Relations
Board and the Court of Appeals in this case, and presented in
the Petitions for Certiorari granted by this Court, is whether
under the National Labor Relations Act, interpreted in light
of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, it is an unfair
labor practice for an employer to discharge dissident employee
for engaging in concerted activities designed to force the
employer to bargain collectively directly with them instead of
with the exclusive bargaining representative„ over alleged
racially discriminatory employment practices.
The company here, the petitioner in No. 73-696, is
a retail department store, which is a party to a collective
agreement.

That agreement contains an antidiscrimination

provision, set forth on page 101 of the printed Appendix,,
under section 21 of the collective agreement.

You will note that the antidiscrimination provision
of the contract prohibits discrimination by reason of race,
color, creed,national origin, age or sex.
There's a potential therefor many and probably most
employees in the bargaining unit, therefore, to belong to one
or another minority group in those categories»
In a series of meetings held in 1968, a group of
employees covered by the agreement, including Messrs. Hawkins
and Hollins, the two whose discharge is the subject of the
decision here, met with their union representative to discuss
various dissatisfactions they had with the company, including
their belief that there was racial discrimination in the
company's employment practices,
At the third meeting, the union representative
expressed his view that there indeed was racial discrimination
and that the union was prepared to invoke the grievance
procedures under the collective agreement, to remedy discrimin­
ation? in accordance with those procedures.
At that -third meeting some of those in attendance
said that they would prefer if the union would picket the
company, they expressed dissatisfaction with the remedy that
the union was proposing to pursue.
The union representative, the chief executive office
of the union, rejected this request on the ground that it
would be contrary to the union's obligations under tine

5

collective agreement to the company;, and that in his view
an orderly processing of grievances would have a broader and
more long-lasting effect»
And on the following day, on behalf of the union,
he formally requested a hearing before the Adjustment Board,
v/hich is the first step in processing the grievances»

And

the hearing was convened in October of that year, and it
started off with presentation of evidence by the union
representative, by questioning employees regarding their
individual grievances,
This was interrupted by employee Hollins, one of
the tv;o who was discharged, who, acting as spokesman for
Hawkins, the other one before the Court, and two others,
read a prepared statement objecting to the prosecution of
grievances on an individual rather than a group basis, and
stating that this group of four would not speak as individuals
but would speak only as a group.
wanted to talk with the president.

And he added that they
As he put it, their main

purpose was to talk to the president to try to reach an
agreement with him to straighten out the problems and
conditions of the store.
Then, after refusing to give testimony, -the four
walked out of the Adjustment Board meeting.
The grievance procedures, nonetheless, were carried
forward, and resulted in promotions being secured for two

6

individuals as to whom grievances had been pursued.
And -bills part of the record is the basis for the
finding of the National Labor Relations Board on page 103 of
the Appendix to the Petition, that -QUESTION:

Excuse me,. Mr* Wallace, which color one

is that?
MR. WALLACE;

This is the dark yellow one, the

Appendix to the Petition,
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR, WALLACE;

Page 103.

The finding of the Board

here, it was the finding of the Hearing Examiner adopted by
the Board, just below the middle of the page;
"All the evidence indicates that the Union, their
duly designated bargaining representative, was endeavoring in
every way available to it under the agreement to adjust any
and all cases of racial discrimination brought to its attention,
arid in at least one and apparently two cases had brought about
the desired adjustment."
And to tliis the Board added, in a footnote on page 55
of ‘die same Appendix, footnote 2 of the Board's order, the
Board added "that the record before us neither requires nor
allows a finding ... that the Union breached its duty of fair
representation."
So what the Board might have done in a case in which
it had been determined, either previously or in the Board

7
proceedings,, that the Union had breached its duty of fair
representation is a question that the Board really did not
reach in this case, and is the additional limitation on die
question presented, that I mentioned at the outset of my
argument»

petition?

MR. WALLACE:

103 is the Board's finding that the

Union was endeavoring in every way available to it under the
agreement to adjust any and all cases of racial discrimination
brought to its attention; and then on page 55, in footnote 2,
is the further statement by the Board that the record neither
requires nor allows finding by the Board that the duty

that

the Union was in breach of its duty of fair representation.
QUESTION:

Well, I don't find that on pcge 55 here.

MR. WALLACE:

Well, it's in footnote 2.

summarising it slightly.

I'm

The second line, page 55, footnote 2

of the Board's order,
QUESTION:

I see it now.

Urih-hunh„

Thank you.

QUESTION:

So that's the qualification that you

mentioned at the outset, or the limitation on the question
presented?
MR. WALLACE:

That is correct, Mr, Justice.

The Board really has not passed on what the result
would be in a situation where there had been a finding that
the Union was in breach of its duty of fair representation.
And counsel for the Board really can take no position on a
matter that the Board hasn't passed on. The Board was divided
3-to~2 in this case.
QUESTION:

I see. .1 thought you were going to maybe

mention ‘the fact that you and your adversaries don't seem to
agree as to what the question at issue is in this case.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, that's why I mentioned at 'the

outs i the question that the Board and the Court of Appeals
decided, and: which was presented in the petitions, and what
we thought was the question.here.
There is some effort in some of the briefs on the
other side, and there are many of them, to in effect attack
the Board's findings as to the objective" of the activities
for which these two people were fired.

9
QUESTION:

Or at least to ignore then;.

And that,

the finding, the Board in that respect was accepted by the
Court of Appeals?
MR. WALLACE:
the Court of Appeals.

It was accepted very emphatically by
Well, at least explicitly, let me put

it that way»
And -this is in, again, the Appendix to the Petition
for Certiorari, on page 24, in footnote 34.
QUESTION:
MR. WALLACE:

What page now?
Page 24, footnote 34, in the second

sentence, the petitioners ''dispute the Trial Examiner's
finding that Hawkins and Hollins activities were 'no mere
presentation of a grievance, but nothing short of a demand
that the company bargain with the picketing employees for the
entire group of minority employees'.

However, we can see no

reason to disturb this finding»"
And the dissenting judge was'even more emphatic on
that point, Judge Wyxanski, on page 43 of the same Appendix.
As he put it, in the fourth line there, "There could not be a
plainer instance of an attempt to bargain respecting working
conditions, as distinguished from an adjustment of grievances.
There are — of course, first, we contend that there
is no reason for the Court to undertake to look behind those
findings supported by all three Court of Appeals judges, but
there is — what support there is, the record is rather thin

10

on this, all seems to us to look in this direction.

Part of it,

where the statement is mads before the Adjustment Board,
indicating that their objective was to bargain with the
president about conditions at The Emporium.
And during the hearing, turning to the other Appendix
now, on page 11, Mr, Hawkins, in the middle of the page, in

responso to the question "What were you seeking?" said,, "To try
to talk to the top management to get better conditions for
The Emporium.."
"How were you going to do this?
"Through group talk and through the president if we
could talk to him."
And then when Hollins was testifying, on pages 60 and
61, he tried, on page 60, to explain why, at the Adjustment
Board proceedings, they objected to taking up individual
grievances rather than the case as a whole.

And after ha

explained it in several different ways, interrogating counsel
says to him, "Just to carry it one step further, it was my
understanding that what you were trying to do and you didn't
want a solution of the problems of individuals, you wanted some
basic change that would benefit the treatment of all minority
people, is that right?"
And the answer is, "That’s correct."
And then on page 67, as he testified further, at the
very bottom of the page, he reiterates that statements

11
"I said that we didn’t want to have our case taken
as an individual thing as I stated before, we all wanted it
taken as a whole for the entire betterment of the minority
groups of black, brown, red and yellow people there at the
store."
And while the exact objectives and demands -are not
stated anywhere with a model of clarity, there is one
indication in one of the exhibits to the record, that begins
on page 115 in this same Appendix, of the sort of thing that
they apparently had in mind.
This was a report that was prepared by these
individuals and. some of those working with them on a survey
that they took of the store, in between -the time of the press
conference and the time when they were fired, after the- two
picketing incidents.
And in the course of this survey on pages 116 and
117, there is a listing of sixteen high-fashion departments
in which there were either all white sales personnel or only
a small number of others? and. then Point E, on page 117
well, there's Point D, "Out of the total Blacks, Filipinos,
Chinese and Mexican, only 5 are Black, 3 Filipino, 3 Chinese
and 1 Mexican,"
E.

"Me demand that all of these specific racial

groups be infiltrated into the areas where the commission is
the highest.

The second floor,"

12

And again on page 118, "We demand selling personnel
of the following Racial groups to foe infiltrated into the
following high commission selling areas", Radio, Tap®
Recorders, the whole furniture department- et cetera„
This is as specific as anything in the record about
the kind of thing they had in mind in asking to see the
president, in holding their press conference, which stated that
they were organizing a boycott of the store because of its
racist policies.
And then in picketing the store, there’s some dispute
about the characterization of their activity as picketing.
They were acting in concert, standing at the store entrances,
giving out leaflets, or urging passers-by at the store
entrances not to patronize the store.
This was characterized by both the Board and the.
Court: of Appeals as picketing, and correctly so, in our view.
Although the respondent disputes whether it was in­
deed picketing.
Now, the Board's finding is the essential premise
for its decision here, and it simply has not reached an issue
of what would be the case if this kind of coercive activity
was undertaken to support a demand that the company deal with
them about grievances.
The distinction between
QUESTION:

Mr, Wallace, is that issue settled out --

13
let’s assume it was not a racial tinge to this case, that
there must have been instances where individual members of a
bargaining unit do picket or have picketed to support the
resolution of a grievance in their behalf, or when the Union
has negotiated wages and hours and working conditions, the
Union as a union doesn't call or have a picket line, or
doesn't strike, but individual employees dostrike, but they picket on their own timeMR® WALLACEs

They don’t
New, is that

There are wildcat strikes, and in

QUESTION: Well, it isn’t a strike, just picketing®
MR® WALLACE:

Many of the cases have been about

wildcat s trikes.
My understanding of this is that there has been
really not much litigation on this, because section 9(a),
which is the section at issue, which designates the rights
of the exclusive representative, and then has the proviso
saying that individuals, including groups of individuals,
can however present their own grievances, has been taken by
the Board to define rights as between the individuals and the
Union, and not as defining a duty on the part of the employer
to bargain with the individuals pressing the grievances®
QUESTION; So you say, outside of the context in
which this case arises, it is not settled whether the activitio
I referred to are protected activities under 8(a)?
MR® WALLACE:

That is correct®

Or under 7, section 7„

QUESTION ;
MR, WALLACE?

My understanding is that a complaint, a

charge that the employer refused to bargain with the individuals
who demand it is not processed by the General Counsel as a
complaint, because he doesn't regard 9(a)

as imposing any

duty on the employer to bargain with the individuals,,
QUESTION:

What if the employer fired the employe©

for doing what I suggested he was doing?

Is that an unfair —

is that settled that that is or isn’t an unfair practice?
MR. WALLACE:

I don't believe that is settled.

There

has been litigation about wildcat strikers, in which the
Circuits have split about whether the strike is
QUESTION;

I would think it might be one thing to

say that the individual employees aren't entitled to bargain
with the employer, but it might be another thing to say he
can fire them.
MR. WALLACES So far as I know, the Board has not
passed on that issue,
QUESTION: Well, it certainly — it's passed on it
in this case,
MR. WALLACE:

Well, it doesn't regard this case as

a case of -QUESTION:

This was a case of •— this is a case of

picketing to gain bargaining rights, according to the Board,
MR. WALLACE;

That's right.

Rather than to get the

15

employer to talk about individual grievances.
So it doesn’t regard the issue as having been
presented in this case.
QUESTION!

And it’s the latter case that is

argued by your brothers on the other side# including a good
many amici, and including, indeed, the exclusive collective
bargaining agent in this case; isn't that right?
MR. WALLACE:

That is correct.

However, the A,F. of

L.-Ccl.G, to which rt belongs, has filed an amicus brief,
addressing the case as
QUESTION:

we see it,
Right,

MR, WALLACE:

I know that.

And coming out at the other side.

Well, all of this leads to a summary of the
reasons why we believe the Board's decision was the correct
one in this case.
In the first place, the principle that would support
the right to engage in this demand for bargaining is a
principle of fragmentation.

These individuals are self-

designated, they hold no credentials indicating the
authorization by the people they purport to represent, to
bargain for them.

There would be nothing to stop any number

of other individuals from coming forward and saying that they,
too, want to bargain on behalf of this same group of employees,
or portions of them; nor would there be any reason why the
same principle should not apply to other groups who have

15
statutory or contractual protection against discrimination.
Such as women

,

the elderly, et cetera.

QUESTION:

Well * Mr, Wallace , could you tell me

again -- I probably missed it — why, in the Board’s view,
the effort of individual employees to bargain with the employer
over a grievance and to support their effort by picketing is
not within the exception to 9(a)?
MP., WALLACE;
QUESTION*

Well, that — that’s ~~

Let’s assume individual employees are

picketing to have the employer addresis their grievance in a
particular way, and the Union is also grieving with the
employer.

Mow, why aren't the employees privileged to do that?
MR, WALLACE:

Well, they are privileged under 9(a)

to meet with the employer, -•».
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR, WALLACE:

to try to adjust their grievance

with him.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR, WALLACE:

That doesn’t, under the proviso to

9(a), derogate from the authority of the Union.

But the Board

has never regarded 9(a) as imposing a duty on the employer to
meet with them, and the cases tend to regard the picketing like
they regard the wildcat strike, and the question is being
whether
QUESTION:

But the employer —

17
MR. WALLACE:

■— or not it’s in support of what the

Onion is trying to accomplish.
QUESTION:

the employer may not be guilty of a

refusal to bargain if he refuses to bargain, but how about
being guilty of an unfair practice if he fires the employee
for exercising what is a privilege under 9(a)?
MR, WALLACE:

Well, there's no question but what

they have a right under 9(a) to do the meeting with the
employer, if he, will meet with them,
QUESTION:
MR,

Well, what did the employer

WALLACE:

And that doesn't take away anything

that the Union gets in section 9.
QUESTION:
for here?

So what did the employer fire these people

Something beyond what’s guaranteed to them in

9(a) .
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

Completely.

Which is what?

MR, WALLACE:

Well, you see, 9(a) is limited to

presenting grievances, and the Board found that this wasn't
an effort to present grievances; this was an, effort to bargain
about —
QUESTION: About what?
MR. WALLACE:

conditions throughout the store,

on behalf of all minority people.

And obviously to bargain

about things that will affect others as well.

18
QUESTION;

If these p ople had wanted just to bargain

with hira about their own status?
MR* WALLACE:

That would be a different case, which

the Board has not passed on*
QUESTION:

Even if it affected other employees?

MR* WALLACE:-

Even if it affected other employees,

the case would be presented in quit® a different context*
If they ware claiming that they were denied a
promotion, or that they were

~ that the restroom on their

floor was not maintained in working order, these things could
affect other employees, but they would be individualised
grievances about something denied to these individual's.
They would not be purporting to be acting in a representative
capacity on behalf of a large number of others who haven't
authorised them as a. bargaining representative to negotiate
about matters that don't affect them, the negotiators themselves
individually, or anyone who's authorized them to speak for
them.
They are seeking to bargain in a representative
capacity about conditions throughout the store, about who
should be selling high-priced ladies' coats, and that sort of
thing, which has nothing to do with any grievance that any of
them has.
And this is the difference between the bargaining and
adjustment of grievances.

The line is sometimes a difficult

19

one, but we don’t think it’s a difficult one in this case»
QUESTION:

You think that when the Board has

applied its experience and resolved thisr that that settles
it pretty much?

MR* WALLACE:

Well, of course the Board is very

experienced in this kind of

fact-finding.

This is one of

the areas of their specialisation and expertise, and here
their findings were upheld by all three Court of Appeals judges
and they are supported by the record in the portions to which
I have

referred.

And in our view the Court of Appeals under­

estimated here in seeking to in some way accommodate the
normal outcome under the National Labor Relations Act with
what it regarded as the policies of Title VII, underestimated the very real potential for interference i^ith the
role of the bargaining agent in authorizing others to speak
for portions of the people covered, in talking about what
remedies should be adopted, even if there's agreement between
the bargaining representative and the dissidents,

that

discrimination exists.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Wallace, under 9(a) that —

it really means nothing, does it, that the management does
not want to discuss it, 9(a) means nothing»
MR. WALLACE:

Well, that’s something -that, so far

as I know, the Board hasn't passed on, and that leaves me in a
position where I can't make a commitment on behalf of the

20

Board.
QUESTION:

So if the employees tell management, We

want to discuss this? and management says, We don't want to
discus?' it? there is no means available for the employee to do
anything?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, I think their usual recourse is

to get the Union to do it on their behalf, because the
employer has to discuss things with the Union.

That’s their —

QUESTION: Well, I understand 9(a) to be when the
Union won’t do it.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, sometimes the Union is willing

to do it.
QUESTION:

Well, if the Union isn’t willing to do

it, and management isn’t willing to talk to him, the employee
is just out.
MR. WALLACE:

The Board has not decided that, and

I can’t really answer the question.

That’s still an open

question.
QUESTION:

Well, I can see the difficulty in

thinking that Congress would put 9(a) in there and end up with
not giving him any relief at all.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, it’s certainly a possible

reading of 9(a), because it’s quite possible that the Union
is trying to adjust grievances in one way and that some
dissident employees want them adjusted in another way, and

21

we'll start engaging in coercive tactics on the employer that
are contrary to what the Union is seeking to accomplish in
the grievance proceeding# and that could be very damaging
to the employer# such as urging shoppers on a Saturday not
to patronize the employer's .store»

And 9(a) doesn’t

necessarily mean that Congress meant to sanction that
activity and to protect those employees from being
discharged if they insisted on doing that»
It does mean that they have a right to talk with
the employer about it# if the employer is willing to make the
adjustments with them# and that that is a proviso to the
*
exclusive authority the Union otherwise had0
QUESTION:

But if the employer talks to the

dissident union member, facing facts# wouldn't the employer
be in trouble with the Union?
MR» WALLACE:

I think that varies with the situation»

In any event# my time has expired here.

I do want

to refer the Court to the legislative history of Title VII
and to the other remedies available, as well as to the fact
that nothing in Title VII purports to speak to collective
bargaining rights or to the question of picketing, to which
there is no reference in the legislative history of Section
704(a)»
Thank you»
QUESTION;

Mr» Wallace# before you sit down# am I

22
correct in understanding your argument as to 8(b)(7(A) was not
raised below?
HR* WALLACES

Well,, it was not raised below, it was

nothing relied upon by the Board*
violation here of 8(b)(7)(A)*

The Board did not find a

We're pointing out that the

facts show a violation of 8(b)(7)(A) and therefore that the
Board's interpretation of Section 7 is not protecting this
activity, is really the only permissible interpretation under
the Act, because Section 7 wouldn't protect something that
violates 8(b)(7)(A).
We're riot saying that -the case should be upheld on
the theory that it was a violation of 8(b) (7) (A)', that is not
a ground that the Board relied upon or that the Board found.
But it's in the picture, it's certainly relevant to construing
the meaning of the other provisions of the Act.

And I don't

think the Court can ignore it.
Thank you,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Hr. Wallace,

Mr. Balirs,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE 0. BAHR3, ESQ*,
ON BEHALF OF THE EMPORIUM CAPWELL COMPANY
MR. BAHR3:

Mr* Chief Justice and may it please the

Court;
I'm not going to repeat or elaborate upon the argu'
ment of counsel for the Board.

I would like, in the limited

23
time available to me, to point out some of the difficulties
and some of the unanswerable questions that have been raised
by the decision below„
When parties undertake to bargain collectively,
they must first understand clearly what employees are under
discussion; and, secondly, who in fact represents those
employees,
This requires 'the answer to three questions:
No. 1, what is the appropriate unit?
No, 2, who are the eligible voters?
And No. 3, what representative do they choose?
Mow, merely because this case involves bargaining
with respect to racial or, minority problems doers not eliminate
those questions.
In fact, it makes them even more difficult.
We know that Hawkins and Hollins, in this case,
purported to represent all minorities, yellow, red, black
and brown.

They made no mention of persons discriminated

against on the grounds of sex or religion* as specified in
Title VII.

And that raises the question as to what is the

appropriate unit for purposes of bargaining in this case.
Should it be the entire group of minority employees?
Or should the employer be required to bargain by each color?
Further, should the colors be divided into nation­
alities?

24

Section 9(b) of the Labor Management Relations Act
declares that the Board shall decide in each case whether#
in order to assure employees the fullest freedom and exercising
the rights guaranteed by the Act, the unit shall be the
employer# the craft unit# the plant unit, or subdivision
thereof.
There .is no mention of race or color or minority„
And that’s a pretty good argument that Congress did not intend
that there should be collective bargaining along racial or
minority .lines.
The point is that the Congress declared that the Board
shall decide this question in each case, and it shall decide
it so as to provide the employees with the maximum freedom of
exercising the rights guaranteed them under the statute.
There is no way in which a decision could be obtained
in this case# because any petition to the Board would be
rejected on the ground that- the employer had already recognized
a representative and had a contract with him.
It is not up to the employer to decide what shall be
the appropriate unit.
The next question is:

Who are the eligible voters?

Whether ws take the unit by color# by race# there must be a
decision as to what persons belong in each group.

And in these

clays of inter-racial marriages and mixed parentages# there are
extremely difficult and complex problems in determining what

25
race or color a person belongs to.

There is no machinery

provided for a determination of the question of the eligibility
list of voters that the employer can safely rely upon in order
to undertake bargaining.
Finally, there is no method provided for talcing a
vote of the employees to decide on what representative they
wish to have represent them.
It would be folly for the employer in this case to
assume that Hawkins and Hollins represented the entire
minority group, or even the blacks employed in the store.
The Trial Examiner pointed out that when the
Adjustment Board hearing took place, there were four men who
walked out of the Adjustment Board hearing and joined the
picket line*

After the employer issued its warning against

the picketing and leafletting, two of the employees dissisted
and there were only Hawkins and Hollins left.

Not a very

impressive presentation to convince the employer that they
represented any substantial number of minority employees.
The record also shows that in the meeting that the
Union held with the minority employees, representatives of the
EEOC and the State FEPC urged the minority employees to go
along with the Union, that it was in their best interest.
And we believe the employer was entitled to express sufficient
doubts about bargaining with Hawkins and Hollins to refuse to
do so

26
Assuming that we waive all of the difficulties
raised by those procedural questions,, we have the problem of
what the employer is supposed to do in order to try to comply
with the opinion of the court below.
And, if the Court please, this is the first case to
my knowledge where any employer has been directed to recognize
two collective bargaining representatives representing the same
employees at the same time*

That's not easy to do»

The Court suggested that ~~ well, I'd likes to read
some of the language of the Court

"We cannot agree that any

inconvenience" —*•
QUBSTIOHs

Where are you reading from, Mr* Bahrs?

MR. BAIIRSt

I'm sorry.

It's cur

the petition

for certiorari on page 29 „

"Me cannot agree that any inconvenience which the
Company might experience in being required to bargain with the
minority here while still participating in the grievance
procedures justifies withdrawing section 7 protection from
these concerted activities."
How, aside from the problem of dealing with two
bargaining representatives at tins same time, the notion of
carrying out the grievance procedures is a futility, because
of the fact that the principal witnesses walked out and
refused to participate.
When it comes to bargaining with the representatives

27
of the minority, I would refer the Court to what is said in
its opinion in Alexander v. Gardner-Denver,

In that case the

Court held that an arbitration under a collective bargaining
agreement did not bar an action in court to correct racial
discriminatione

But when it came to the subject of

bargaining, on the subject of discrimination, this is what
the Court said:
Title VII strictures are absolute and represent a
congressional command that each employee be free from
discriminatory practices.

Of necessity, the rights conferred

can form no part of the collective bargaining process since
waiver of these rights would defeat the paramount congres­
sional purpose behind Title VII„
That is a statement by the unanimous Court.
Bow, Hawkins and Hollins were picketing the
employer, to compel the employer to bargain with him
concerning racial discrimination,

29
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH HECIIT, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR, HECIIT;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court;
Before starting on my own presentation, I'd like to
respond briefly to some of the points that preceding counsel
have made, and some of the questions which have been asked by
the Court.
Let me tcuke them in reverse order.
I think it’s clear that the Jefferson Standard
question is not here before the Court at this time.

That was

the issue upon which the Court of Appeals remanded to the
Board to determine -whether there had been such a display of
disloyalty that the employees ought not be rehired.
But the Court recognized that the Trial Examiner,
who wrote the decision which the Board adopted, while he had
made extensive findings of fact, had declined to rule on the

j

issuer

And on that basis the Court of Appeals refused to

rule on it, either.
I think it's not been raised in the Petition for
Certiorari, and is not before the Court at this time,,
I trust from our briefs that it's clear that we're
not here advocating collective bargaining according to race.
Quite the opposite.
It's the purpose of our position to encourage

30

unions and management to be more responsive to the problems of
minorities, and to solve those problems within the framework
of collective bargaining.
The courts have said,, we think it's correct that
there cannot be strong concerted union activity so long as
the employees are divided.
That would be the case if the union had no
responsibility# if the employer had no responsibility,

V7e

think what we're urging upon the Court is a method by which
minorities can be accommodated, by which statutes can be
accommodated, so that industrial peace will continue,
QUESTION;

Would you be making these same arguments,

Mr. Hechfc, if the whole episode had involved two women who
were picketing against alleged discrimination against women?
MR* IDSCHTs

If the women engaged in their concerted

activities on a good-faith belief, which the Court found, if
the women had attempted to go through the union — for seven
months Hollins and Hawkins tried very hard to use the processes
which the union controlled, that is to say, the grievance
process; it proved to be a futile attempt.

And at that point,

reluctantly, Hollins and Hawkins, with the advice of the union
that what they intended to do was not unlawful, did not
violate the terms of the contract, abandoned the union.
If the women had the' strong statistical support for
their claims, that we knew it was a good-faith claim, then I

31

think the answer is yes, we would make exactly the same
it's exactly the same ~~
QUESTION;

Then your argument would probably be

the same if we had hypothetically suggested Catholics,
Catholic employees as a group, or any other identifiable
group.
MR. HECIITj

Mr0 Justice Burger, if all of the facts

which I listed before were present, if there were discrimina­
tion and good-faith belief that the employer was discriminating
on the basis of race, for instance, or religion, as you've
suggested, yes, our answer would be the same.

We think that's

•what the law requires.
I think it important to remind the Coir t that this
case involves a discharge, it does not involve a refusal to
bargain.

No one has made that charge.

It's really not before

the Court.
What is before the Court is the employer's ability
to fire these two employees for having engaged in the
concerted activity in which they engaged.
QUESTION:

You think that it's the Title VII

factor that makes the difference?

Absent Title VII, absent

the racial dimension to the case, the discharge would have
been proper under Jefferson Standard?
MR. IIECIIT:

No, not at all, Your Honor,

We have

not argued the Jefferson Standard issue in our brief to this

32
Court, because v?e didn’t believe it was appropriate.
QUESTION: Well, you say you don’t rely on Title VII
at all?
MR. HF.CJIT:

No, I did not say that»

We think that

Title VII —
QUESTION:

You think Title VII makes the difference

or not?
MR. HECIITY

No, it does not make the difference.

It

makes it crystal-clear*
But we have argued in the brief that, the National
Labor Relations Act itself prohibits discrimination in
employment, and protects concerted activity of employees.
QUESTION;

Well, that’s absent section — Title VII,

isn't it?
MR* IIECHT: Absolutely, Your Honor,
QUESTION: But it’s not absent the racial
MR. IIECHT;
QUESTION:

factor?

It is not absent the racial factor.
Absent the racial factor, would a discharge

for picketing by a minority, where there is or isn’t an
exclusive bargaining agent, is a discharge for picketing an
unfair practice?
MR, HEClIT:

Let me try to break the question down for

a minute, if I can.
In this case we have alleged that “what the employe*'.,3
have done was to seek parity. That is to say, they have sought

33
what tlia contract as well as statute requires»
nondiscrimination clause in the contract»

There is a

The employees

here sought to implement that provision» That was their
purpose»
We have also argued that picketing is not involved
here»

While the Board and the Court did draxtf the conclusion

that the employees had picketed, and there's no sense trying
to hide that, the facts also show that what the employees
did was to distribute handbills»

There's no sense hiding

that, either»
We believe it is appropriate for this Court to
look at the facts and to draw the proper legal conclusion
based on those facts,

And the. facts are simply not in

dispute»
There is no factual allegation in the record,
there's no suggestion that these employees moved with signs
or placards»
The Court has found that picketing is very different
from leafletting, that there is an element often of coercion,
stated or unstated, to picketing»

But that's not present here»

The employees were stationary*

They distributed

pieces of paper with printing oh them»
QUESTION:
MR» IIECI1T:

Were they stationary in the doorway?
They were hot stationed in the doorway,

Your Honor, they were stationed near the doorway»

But the

34
record is also clear that there was no harassment, no violence,
no incitement to violence, no obstruction of customers,
There wasn't even
QUESTION:

Well, there could be — there could be

harassment by just standing in the doorwayD
MR. HECHTs

Well, the people who were distributing

the leaflets were harassed, they were called named by the
customers who came in? but they did not, in turn, harass -the
employees, simply by standing there.
QUESTIONs Well, what do you say about Mr* Bahrs’
point that what you want are two unions, representing the exact
same group of employees?
MRbHECIIT:

It’s one of the reasons why we have

urged upon the Court to find *-■- the conclusion of law, rather,
that the employees were engaged in furthering a grievance *
They were seeking that which the contract promised them.
If there were bargaining, there would be problems•
An employer can't be asked to recognize, for the purposes of
collective bargaining, more than one unit — more than one
union, I'm sorry.

The statute makes that very clear.

But the statute also makes it clear that, employees,
whether individually or in combination, and Section 9(a)

talks

about groups of employees who may have grievances, have every'
right under the statute, quite apart from the racial issue, to
pursue that grievance.

That’s what the employees did here.

QUESTION:

Mr, Hecht, you were drawing a distinction,

as I understood it, between picketing and handing out
leaflets.

If you agreed that there had been picketing in

this case, with all of the other facts and circumstances
being identical, would your position be different?

I

MR, HECIIT;

Section 8(b) (7) of the statute, of the

National Labor Relations Act, which is the operative section
with regard to picketing, has three requirements, Your Honor,
One, that there be picketing.
Two, that the picketing be performed by a labor
union, which Hollins and Hawkins certainly were not.
Third, that, what they sought was recognition.
certainly didn't seek recognition.
prosecute a grievance.

They

They were trying to

They did not ever suggest that they

were interested in accouterments of collective bargaining.

38
They were not looking toward an on-going relationship with
the employer that would include formal terras and conditions of
employment.

They were there for one purpose only, to implement

their statutory and their contractual right to nondiscrimina­
tion in employment.
8(b)(7)(A) does not apply under any circumstances.
QUESTION:

I understand that is your position;, but if

you assumed or agreed , for example <> that they were picketing,
would that make the case different, in your view?
MR. HECIIT:
QUESTION s
MR. HECIIT:

No, it xtfould not.
Would not.
In fact, the Board and the Court found

that there was picketing, —
QUESTION: That was ray understanding.
MR. HECIIT:

— but that made no difference to the

resolution.
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

Yes.
You're really arguing a case that isn't

here, a case that well might be here if the findings had been
different.

But the findings of the Trial Examiner, accepted

by the Board and accepted, then unanimously by the three members
of the Court of Appeals, were that your clients ware attempting
to bargain,
MR. HECIIT:

Yes.

Now, I think that those are not findings so much as

39
conclusions of law, which this Court has the authority and
often exercises the authority to correct.
But I need to make it clear that we don’t apologize
for the Court of Appeals decision.

We find that we're

altogether able to support that in every way.
What we do think is that it's analytically clear
to call what happened prosecution of a grievance and
distribution of leaflets.
And we think that that more clearly reflects the
facts in the record, but we certainly * donrfc mean to suggest
to the Court that it’s necessary to find either of those
things in order to support the result that the District of
Columbia Circuit reached.
I wanted to mention just a few facts.
In November 1968, Tom Hollins and Jim Hawkins,[sic]
two black stock clerks at The Emporium, were fired because,
as their warning notices and as their termination slips said,
they twice have distributed leaflets to the public protesting
their employer’s racially discriminatory employment practices.
This is the only reason for discharge mentioned
either in the preliminary warnings or in the discharge slips
themselves*
Mo one disputes that the employees1 concerted
activity was an effort to vindicate their statutory and
contractual rights to nondiscrimination, rights, as this Court

40

has said, of the highest priority? nor that their conduct was
peaceful.

There was no violence, no obstruction, they were on

a public sidewalk, there was no harassment of customers, no
disparagement of goods and services, no appeal to the employees,
no work stoppage, no strike.

They leafletted twice on

Saturdays, on their own time.
No one disputes that the concerted activities were
based on a good-faith belief.

In fact, it v;as the union's

official position that discrimination was being practiced at
The Emporium.
No one disputes that for seven months Hollins and
Hawkins tried to work through the union, that they undertook
their own efforts only when it became clear that they could not
succeed in a realistic remedy for racial discrimination by
following the union's processes, and the union advised them
that they wore free as individuals to do what they intended to
do.

'

'
Hie question before the Court, then, wa would say,

is whether this lawful concerted activity somhoe is deprived
of the protection of the National Labor Relations Act because
it may have threatened or harmed union-management relations.
And the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
held that the activities ware protected, the discharges were
prohibited, that the activities, which the Court character!zed
as attempts to bargain, constituted such limited interference

41
with section 9(e) exclusivity principles -that because of the
employees' purpose in vindicating their important rights,
the employees remain entitled to the protection of the Act.

QUESTION: And even in the light of Title VII?
MR* HECHT:
QUESTION:
MR, IIECIIT;

Yes#
Okay.
We have discussed already, and I see no

reason to go over it, why we think the employees' were engaged
in protest activity, why we think that the employees were
engaged in the presentation of a grievance, that they were not
bargaining*
But even if it is bargaining, as the lower courts
concluded and I have mentioned before, we fully support the
Court's opinion.
Hawkins and Hollins are still protected, because here
on the facts, Hawkins and Hollins first went to the union, they
tried to work through -the union and with the union for seven

45
months.

In think Gardner-Denver, the case that my opposing

attorney has suggested to the Court, brought to the Court,
indicates that these kinds of informal resolutions of racial
problems is always a preferred method, where it can work.
If you can go to the union, the union can bring it to the
employer, if you can effect -the remedy, good.
Employees abandon the union only when the futility
of their staying with the union became clear, and when the
union had told them that they were free to undertake the
individual action that they intended to take.
QUESTION:

You have already answered, I think,

Mr. Justice Powell, saying your position would be the same if
they had in fact picketed instead of handing oxit leaflets.
So that what you're saying, I take it, is that when members
of the union, any members of the union, are not satisfied
with the union’s result for them and for their claims, then
they may engage in typical collective bargaining type of
protest, that is union picketing, the same kind of technique
the union uses to enforce?
MR. HECIIT:

No, I think it's clear that the employee

normally cannot do that in s labor-management situation.
First of all, because of the special characteristics of
picketing, secondly, because during the period of a contract
or —•
QUESTION:

You say the special characteristics of

46

picketing, but you say this case would be no different if they
had picketed instead of handing out. leaflets, didn’t you?
MR. IIECHT;

The major point of difference, I think,

would be that under a regular kind of problem that the employees
had, section 9(a) has made it clear that their recourse is to
try — is to try to work first through the union, their
exclusive bargaining agent? then to go to the employer with
the grievance if that proved necessaryNow, the employer has ho duty to meet ~~ that was one
question that came up earlier.

It's clear under section 9(a)

that the employer has no duty to meet with the employees,
But he can if he wishes. And if he cares to make an adjustment
that is consistent with the collective bargaining agreement,
then he's got to call the union in to be present at that
adjustment.
It's another reason -- if I can divert for just thi
point

it's another reason why we think it's better

analytically to see this as a grievance, because then there's
a very practical method of working out minority problems.
Minority members, if they find that the union has not been as
responsive as is necessary, may go to the employer.

If the

employer wants to deal with them, then all he's got to do is
follow -the procedure under section 9(a) and call in the union,
to be present, or hopefully before that, and help to negotiate
the adjustment that the contract requires, and that the law

47
requires.
I’m not certain I have answered your question*
QUESTIONs

Well, you’ve enlightened me somewhat on

your view.
MRo HECIIT:

But perhaps not on the question you had

in mind.
QUESTIONS
MR. HECHT:
QUESTION:

Mr. Hecht, —
Yes, sir?
~ what is your position as to what the

record shows about exactly why these employees did abandon
the union?
MR. HECHT:

I think the record’s clear from the

testimony of Hollins and Hawkins themselves, that they
abandoned the union principally because, after waiting seven
months, the union insisted upon handling the problem as if
there were a series, seriatim of individual grievances which
should be adjusted individually.

And Hollins and Hawkins

were scared to death that what would happen was that there
would be some token individual adjustments? and, in fact,
that's exactly what happened.

There was at least one, perhaps

two adjustments of promotion on behalf of minority employees,
and that was 1968, and not a single thing has happened since,
QUESTION: Would the grievance procedures in the
contract have permitted the type of group resolution that
Hollins and Hawkins wanted?

48

MR* HECHTs

There's nothing in the contract that would

tend to prevent that kind of group presentation, and the law
specifically permits it*

Section 9(a) speaks of grievances

presented by individuals or groups of individuals.

So X don't

think the contract cculd attempt to prohibit that even if it
wanted toy it would be unlawful*
QUESTIONS But that's presented directly to the
employer by 9(a), isn't it?
MR. HECHTs

I'm sorry?

QUESTION:

You say that the law permits presenta­

tion by employees or groups of employees,
MR, HECHT:
QUESTION:

That's right.
—• I was curious as to whether, under the

grievance procedure in the collective bargaining contract,
that the type of group resolution would be permissible that
Hollins and Hawkins wanted.
MR. HECHT;

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, X believe the

contract is silent on that.

I'm unaware of anything in the

contract that states one way or the other.
QUESTION:

How about the law?

Assuming absence of

anything in the contract, when you begin doing that, isn't that
then you're no longer processing a grievance, you're trying
to change the collective bargaining agreement, aren't you?
MR* HECHTs

That’s what Hollins

They didn’t want more than the whites,

they didn't want more than any other racial or ethnic
minority or sexual minority? all they wanted was parity.
They wanted what the contract provided.
That’s why it was a grievance.

a group processing of this so-called grievance did they want?
Everybody who was non-white, Indians, Mexicans, MexicanAmericans or Mexicans?
MR. HECHT:

Yes. The question went not so much to

processing as it did to remedy.

That Hollins and Hawkins

wanted a remedy that would establish equal employment oppor­
tunity for all minorities, racial, ethnic and sexual.
QUESTION: They wore talking about only the employees
presently employed, then employed, though, weren’t they?
MR. HECHT:

Yes.

QUESTION: They were not talking about hiring?
MR. IIECIIT:
QUESTION:
MR. HECHT:

Oh, no.
No,
No, it was nondiscrimination in employ-

50

ment of those who were present at The Emporium.
QUESTIONs
MR, HECHT:

Right.
Most of the record testimony, which has

to do with what the employees did* how they ascertained as a
good-faith belief that there was discrimination, really goes
to the placement of individuals throughout the store and to
their promotions.
QUESTION:
MR, HECHT;

Unh-hunh.
I think it's silent as to hiring.

Although there is statistical information in the
record that the hiring was not so good, either»
If there are no more questions — thank you very much»
QUESTION;

I’ll ask a minor one»

I'm frank to say I'm disturbed by the standard
that the majority of the Court of Appeals established, when it
speaks of the first resort to the union and then failure to
remedy the discrimination, and I quote now, "to the fullest
extent possible by the most expedient and efficacious means,"
What does that mean?
MRo HECHT:

And how can it be implemented?

Let me be frank to say that at first I

was troubled by that standard, too.

And I'd like to offer the

following observations on it, if I can»
I think the standard attempts to go a little bit
farther than the Court has gone in its duty of fair representa­
tion cases.

Duty of fair representation, as we have' indicated

51
in our brief, always requiras a showing of malice„
The union here was not malicious, they simply
weren't effective»

I think the Court is

the court below

is suggesting that that kind of inactivity, of ineffectiveness,
of disinterest may be enough to permit employees to try to
go it without the union.
The Board administers phrases and standards of tin at
amorphousness all the time, Your Honor,,

They administer

standards such as duty to bargain, duty to bargain in good
faith; these are very difficult. Duty of fair representation.
These are very difficult as words alone to administer, but
that's what an administrative agency does.
As this Court has said in a case involving
jurisdictional disputes, soon after that section of the
statute became implemented, the difficulty of administering a
standard is not a reason for the Board not to accept the
jurisdiction to administer the standard.

It nay be difficult,

but doesn’t give them an excuse to avoid it.
Finally, may I point out that recently, in a case
that we cited several times in our brief, a case of the
Labor Board's, called Bekins, Bekins Moving, the Board showed
that it was willing to get into the very difficult area of
race discrimination when the question came ups
union be certified after it had won an election?

Should a
But the

employer alleged that the union was practicing discrimination.

52
That’s not easy., either, and the Board said that,
they said, it's a difficult test that we have set for ourselves,
but we're going to take it on a case-by--case basis, and we're
going to do it, because we think the Constitution requires
that.
I don’t think that the test that the Court of Appeals
has suggested here is any nore difficult than those which the
Board has voluntarily, over a period of time, administered.
Thank you very much»
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. flecht.

Mr, Wallace, do you have anything further?

only one minute#
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G# WALLACE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD
MR. WALLACE:

Well, with respect to the standard,

I'll just say that the word "remedying" and what constitutes
the proper remedy for an agreed-upon discrimination is itself
subject to great dispute, let alone by the most efficacious,'
ineffective means; and we regard this as not only putting the
Board into a very difficult role of trying to second-guess
the. discretion exercised by the bargaining representative, but
also putting the bargaining representative into a role of
deciding, rather than what it thinks is the best way to
proceed, deciding what it thinks the Board will think is the
way that it should proceed

to remedy something.

53

Which is very troublesome in the standard adopted.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.

the above-entitled matter was submitted.]
