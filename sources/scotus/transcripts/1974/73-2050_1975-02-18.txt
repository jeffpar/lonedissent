MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 73-2050, United States versus Luis Antonio Ortiz
consolidated with No. 73-6848, John Lee Bowen versus the
United States,
Mr. Evans, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK L. EVANS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES
MR. EVANS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The question in these cases which were consolidated
for oral argument is whether the principles of AlmeidaSanchez should be applied to invalidate a warrantless search
of a vehicle for the presence of concealed aliens when
conducted at a border patrol check point rather than by
officers on a roving patrol.
Each case also presents a retroactivity issue
that need be reached by the Court only if it disagrees with
our contentions with respect to the principle issue and on
that issue our contention is that check point searches in
the Mexican border area may properly be conducted without
a ’warrant and without particular knowledge about any specific
vehicle that is to be searched.
QUESTION;

And without regard to the location of

the check point, the fixed check point.

4
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:

Correct.
And that is the factor on which these

two cases are distinguishable from the one just argued?
MR. EVANS:

Correct.

It Is also the basis on xvhich

these cases are distinguishable from the next which raises an
issue oh the merits — a slightly different variety — variant
of Almefda-Sanchez in which a roving patrol officer stopped
but did not search an automobile.
QUESTION:

What’s that, you say it is irrelevant

where it" was — where the check point is?
MR. EVANS:

Well, It is not irrelevant in the broad

sense of the reasonableness.
QUESTION:

Well, doesn’t it have to be, within the

statute it should be a reasonable distance from the border,
I think.
MR. EVANS:

It has to be within a reasonable dis­

tance of the border under the statute and within 100 miles
from the border under the regulation implementing the statute.
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:

When was the regulation adopted?
I am not sure.
Soon after the statute or
I believe it was adopted shortly after

the statute was passed.
The search in the Bowen case was conducted two and
a half years prior to this Court's decision in Almeida-Sanchez

at a check point on California State Highway 36 about 36 miles
north of the Mexican border and a picture of that check
point appears in — on page 2a of our reply brief in Ortiz.
It was 10:00 o’clock in the evening on a week
night and traffic was light.

When Bowen approached the

check point in a camper truck, the officers stopped him and
asked him for his citizenship and then, as a routine matter,
they asked him to open the rear of the camper to permit them
to check for the presence of concealed aliens.
As soon as Bowen did so, Agent Ortmeier smelled
marijuana coming from the camper.

He thereupon entered the

camper with a. flashlight and saw in the forward part of the
camper on a mattress what appeared to be, in his words,
either a bed roll or a person.
When he investigated, he found that the objects
were actually two backpacks and' as he approached the mattress,
.he saw stacked underneath the mattress kilo bricks of
marijuana in cellophane-wrapped packages •
After Bowen was arrested and a full search of the
camper was conducted, the officers found 356 pounds of
marijuana in the camper and 153 benzedrine tablets in a jac­
ket on the front seat of the camper.
Bowen was prosecuted and convicted for the drug
offenses based upon the evidence seized from the camper
and the Ninth Circuit initially affirmed the convictions,

6
stating simply that the search and seizure were plainly lawful.
This Court thereafter remanded the case for further
consideration in light of Almeida-Sanchez and the Court of
Appeals again affirmed in a two-part en banc opinion.
In part one, the Court, splitting seven to six,
ruled that the search of a vehicle for aliens at a check point
may not be conducted in the absence of probable cause or a
warrant unless the check point is at the functional equivalent
of the border.
It also held that the check point in this case was
not at the functional equivalent of the border.
In part two of the opinion, however, the Court held
that the ruling in part one should not be applied to exclude
the evidence seized from Bowen’s camper because the search
took place prior to this Court’s decision in AImeida-Sanchez
at a time when the settled law in the Ninth Circuit was that
such check point searches were valid.
The search in Ortiz took place after this Court’s
decision in Almeida-Sanchez but before the Ninth Circuit’s
decision In Bowen.

It occurred at the border patrol check

point on interstate route 5 near San Clemente, California,
about 62' miles north of the Mexican border and a picture of
that checkpoint appears on the prior page In the appendix to
the reply brief.
QUESTION:

Mr. Evans, when was your reply brief

MR. EVANS:

QUESTION:

How about the Highway 86 check point?

Where on Highway 86 was the check point?
MR. EVANS:

It is approximately 36 air miles north

of the Mexican border.
QUESTION:
MR, EVANS:

North of Brawley?
Let me tales a look at the map so I

can — do you have copies of these maps that we had lodged
with the Court for distribution to each Justice?

MR. EVANS:

I think that is correct.
QUESTION:

MR. EVANS:

Do you know how far from the border?
It is approximately 36 miles, air miles

from the border., meaning from the twin cities of Mexicali
and Calexico.
QUESTION:

Now, when you describe this as a fixed

check point, the signs in the arch over the highway are
permanent, mox',e or less, are they not?

9
MR. EVANS:

That is correct with respect to the

San Clemente checkpoint.

There is an overhead support for

permanent signs which have lights that can be; turned on or
off depending on whether the checkpoint is in operation.
QUESTION:

Well, that is to the right of your

MR, EVANS:

It is also the site of a

Not the port of entry.

QUESTION:

Now, the federal Inspection is

initially made on the highway itself?
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:;

That is correct.
At stop signs.
The cars are Tunneled into two lanes

ordinarily with one officer standing right behind the
stop sign and one officer standing on an [inaudible] here.
QUESTION:

So, Mr. Evans, some of those cars may

then be shunted off to the —'V'- jV

MR. EVANS:

That is correct.

At San Clemente the

prior practice had been that the point officer _

10
practice as it has been operated for some time is that the
traffic slows down to roughly five

miles an hour and the

officer standing at the point, as it is called, visually
suveys the approaching traffic and when something arouses his
suspicion about a particular automobile, he refers it to the
secondary area, where there are additional officers to make
inquiry of the occupants of the vehicle and If it seems
appropriate at the time, to conduct a search of the vehicle.
QUESTION:

Well, now, looking at the next page, at

the Highway 86 check point, apparently everything automati”
cally is funneled off to what -—
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
—- apparently is a secondary point.

Is there a reason for that?
MR. EVANS:

Well, the traffic is far lighter on

Highway 86 and as a consequence, the officer at the point —
there he is — now, to go back for a second, the point officer
at San Celmente almost never says anything to the passengers
in the vehicles.
to secondary.

He

either waves them through or refers them

The officer here, however, talks — according

to the record — to about 75 percent.
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:

The officer where?
I'm sorry.

There's a small hut.

Oh, yes, I —
You can see it on the island there

QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:

But the car has to go off to that side,
It goes off to the side.

The officer

there ordinarily, in about 75 percent of the cases, will
lean over, say "Good morning, this is an Immigration check
point.

What is your citizenship, please?"
And after a response, the car is ordinarily waved

through

although In about 10 or 15 percent of the cases the

automobile is subjected to a search.
Now, the Ortiz search, which took place at the
San Clemente check point, there is not all that many facts
in the record.

The facts v?ere stipulated .

We know that the

search occurred at the check point when Ortiz approached it
in a 1969 Chevrolet.

He was referred to the secondary

inspection area and the officers there opened the trunk of
the car and found three Mexican aliens who were present in
this country illegally.
Ortiz was prosecuted and convicted of transporting
these aliens knowing them to be in the United States.
QUESTION:

Now, Mi*. Evans, are these later photo­

graphs in your reply brief, are these photographs of the
actual car and the people In it?
MR. EVANS:

No, I should explain that the photo­

graphs appearing in the — the first two photographs are not

afterwards.

Well., 5-a is someone under the hood,

MR. EVANS:

either one of these cases, are they?
MR. EVANS:

Yes, they are.

And are these just posed models, or

don’t you know?
MR. EVANS:

No, no, these are — the record reflects

14
that these are the actual vehicles and the actual persons
who were apprehended.
As I say* I don't know whether the —- at what point
the photographs were taken.

Obviously there is no way for me

to know that but my understanding is that these are all real
cases and there is testimony with respect to each of these
photographs in the hearing.

compartment cases.

There are

But the more likely manner of apprehen­

sion is from the vehicle itself by apprehending aliens
sitting visibly in the passenger compartment.
Actually, the principal purpose, I thought it might
be useful to include these photographs to show that it is
not unusual, at least it happens with some regularity that
human beings are hidden in trunks in hoods in compartments
that seem too small to contain them or, indeed, even under a
car. as the last photograph in the reply brief shows,
QUESTION:

Is it in one of these records or in the

record of some other case that I am recalling that some —
that it has not been unknown that some persons being
smuggled in died from suffocation?

16
MR, EVANS;

It appears In this record on a number of

occasions, dying of asphyxiation.

There are occasions when,

in this record, when aliens apparently were either pushed or
jumped from moving vehicles approaching a check point to their
death.
It Is a dirty business and people do die,
QUESTION:

Are you going to get into why the service

needs check points?
MR. EVANS:

I certainly am,

Mr. Justice White, our principal contention in this
case is that there are significant differences between roving
patrols and check points, in terms not only of the governmental
need, not only the nature of the intrusion or the nature of
the circumstances in which intrusion occurs, but also in terms
of the amenability of the operation to a meaningful warrant
procedure.
These differences, in our view, make it possible for
the Court to do here what it was unwilling to do in AlmeidaSanchez, and that is, consistently with the Fourth Amendment
to give effect to the Congressional judgment reflected in
Section 287(A)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act,
that searches of vehicles for aliens within a reasonable
distance of the border may reasonably be conducted without
warrants and without specific facts casting suspicion on a
particular vehicle to be searched.

17
I'd like to start by discussing the governmental
need involved in these operations.
In some respects., the public interest is quite
analagous —- similar, identical for that matter to that
involved in the circumstances that were before this Court in
Alme 1 da.~Sanchez except perhaps that the problem has intensi­
fied.
At the time of the Baca hearing which is the
consolidated District Court proceeding of which the Ortiz
case was a part, it was estimated that there were about
one million aliens present in this country Illegally.
Current estimates place the figure much higher,
ranging from five million to 12 million.
Of the deportable aliens who are apprehended in
this country, some 90 percent are Mexican nationals and about
98 percent of those who have entered clandestinely, without
inspection, have — are all Mexican nationals.
QUESTION:

Does the record show what proportion

are uncovered at a fixed check point?
MR. EVANS:
in that detail.

Well, the figures are not broken down

The record shows that in Fiscal Year 1973,

more than 55,000 illegal entrants -were apprehended in border
patrol traffic checking operations which in. that period would
have included to a certain extent roving patrol operations.
But that was always a far less significant

18
proportion of the apprehensions, that is, roving patrols
accounted for far less — far fewer apprehensions so you can
think in terms, I think, roughly of 50,000 out of the — it
was about 13 percent as I recall from the record of the total
number of deportable aliens apprehended by the border patrol
for the whole year.
The social cost that is associated with the
presence of these many millions of illegal entrants is also
enormous and it, too, is intensified, particularly in this
present period of high unemployment.
The District Court related one estimate that as
long ago as 1971, when nearly 600,000 Californians were
unemployed, between 200,000 and 300,000 illegal immigrants
were employed in that state earning $100 million of wages.
And the group of American citizens and lawfulresident aliens who were the hardest hit by the presence of
illegal entrants are the group of unskilled or slightly
skilled workers who, in

any event, find it difficult to

find employment.
The Court also found that illegal immigrants pose a
potential health hazard of the high incidence of communicable
disease which is not treated because these persons have not
presented themselves for inspection at the border and in some
states, the District Court noted, the public assistance
resources of the communities are devoted in large part to

19
illegal immigrants and their families.
We think that the public interest in the effective
enforcement of the immigration laws is obvious.
The traffic check point system plays a substantially
greater role in the border patrols enforcement scheme than
do roving patrols.

Roving patrols are themselves important,

as we have argued — as we argued in Almeida-Sanchez and as
Mr. Pry will tell you shortly but they have always been
essentially supplementary to the check points themselves
which are the heart of the enforcement effort.
The record shows that most of the inland movement
of illegal aliens is on the major highways leading north
from the border and it is there that the check points are
placed.
Apart from the line watch which is the patrol of
the physical boundaries, the check points are the principal
deterrent to illegal entry and the record demonstrates what
the concurring and dissenting opinions recognized in AlmeidaSanchez, that the line watch itself is simply incapable of
controlling the unauthorized entries across our 2,000 miles
of border.
QUESTION:
border.

One of these is 62 miles from the

Are there any further from the border than that?
MR. EVANS:

The farthest from the border is the

Truth or Consequences check point in New Mexico which is 98

20
miles from the border.

There are none beyond the 100-mile

limit.
QUESTION:

Well, that Is part of the regulations.

MR. EVANS:

The regulation specifies 100 miles.

QUESTION:

Well, are there any others between 62

and 98?
MR. EVANS:

Yes, they vary.

Most of them are beyond

25 miles, in part because in most cases it is strictly beyond
the

California area.
QUESTION:

Well, put It the other way.

Most are

within what distance?
MR. EVANS:

All of them are within 100.

for me to say what most are within.

It is hard

There is a. wide variety

outside the 25-mile range.
The border patrol agents testifying in the consoli­
dated District Court proceeding testified that their inter­
views with apprehended aliens and their intelligence sources
in Mexico made it plain that the check points were the
principal deterrent to unlawful entry .
QUESTION:

But In some circumstances, I gather, the

check point away from the border is not to supplement but to —
but is a substitute for a traffic check at the border.
MR, EVANS:

Well, there — Mr. Justice White, there

are situations and there is a recent case in the Fifth
Circuit that — In which the situation is close to this -—•

21
where there are ports of entry on the border that close
down at night and the check point

located 10 or 12 miles

from the border operates at night.
Now, if that is a substitute for the port of entry,
I would say it is.

But they don’t -- the function of the

border patrols’ traffic check point is not to perform, the
function, the identical function it performed at the border,
that is, a ful 1 customs and Immigration search and inspection,,
It is just not — that is not what they are doing.

Their

job is to only look for illegal Immigrants and not at all
for —- I mean, they are designated as customs officers so
that they can make appropriate seizures and arrests when
their investigations lead to discoveries of narcotics,
But they are not ~~ or the discovery of any
illegal contraband but they are not — that is not their
principal function.

Their principal function is one of

looking for aliens and they don’t perform the full inspection
services that are performed at the border itself.
QUESTION:

Yes, but there are some places, I

gather, you can cross the border legitimately and not be
subject to an inspection, right at the border.
MR. EVANS:

If there are, I am not aware of them,

I don’t believe that is the case.
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:

Well, what about at night?
Well, it is not legitimate to cross

22
the border when the port of entry is down.
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:

You just don’t cross.
Well, you are not —
You have a check point?
Well, there is —
You have the check point inland.
There is the check point inland.

Now,

in this particular case that I am referring to, in the Fifth
Circuit, the highway on which the check point was located
was one that parallels the border, wandering further or
closer but the check point itself was quite close to these
two ports of entry that were closed at night.
QUESTION:

Well, does the port of entry perform

any function that relieves the burdens on what happens at
the border?
MR. EVANS:

Well, that —- it doesn’t really.

It

performs a very similar function with respect to those who are
determined to enter without inspection but as to those — I
mean, the function of the port of entry is to inspect those
who enter lawfully and present themselves for inspection to
determine whether they lawfully can enter this country and
whether they are bringing anything that needs to be declared.
But the purpose of the inland check points is to
determine whether someone has entered without inspection or
has exceeded the limits of his entry permit.

23
QUESTION:

I take it, at the border there is some,

there is very heavy commuter traffic at some point.
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:

That’s right.
And the border patrol people just don’t

interrupt that flow of traffic, do they?
MR. EVANS:

Now, that is in the border area of the

United States,
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. EVANS :

Now, so far as the extent to which the

officers at the ports of entry in busy ports check every
vehicle or check every person — I don’t knoxtf the answer to
that.

I don't think they check necessarily everybody but

they — I suppose they have some superficial inquiry made
of everybody.

But the border patrols —

QUESTION:

But if you weren’t reluctant to interrupt

that flow of heavy commuter traffic, you might not need a
check point in the interior.
MR. EVANS:

No, I don’t think that is correct

because the check points,''Mr. Justice White, are not
designed so much to get to apprehend or deter the entry
through the port.

What they are concerned with is the 98

percent who enter without inspection.
There are a very small number who enter* lawfully
and then violate the terms of their entry permits. It is
really the entrance without inspection that the inland check

points are designed to apprehend.
QUESTION:

Mr. Evans, in this connection, the 72-

hour passes are good up to 25 miles, as 1 understand it.
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
And am I correct also in understanding

that this is one of the reasons, perhaps the principal
reason why these check points are located beyond the 25-mile
area?
MR. EVANS:

Yes, it is a combination of that and,

as I indicated, the urban congestion in the immediate border
areas, particularly in California.

But that is correct.

In

order to control not only those who come across lawfully with
visitor’s cards to control their unlawful exceeding of the
25-mile limit, which is a very successful effort because very
few people do, It is also designed in order to prevent the
use of forged or illicit visitor’s cards which are used very
widely by smuggling operation^, in the area and'- one of the
reasons why a check point within 25 miles could accomplish
nothing in this respect at least, is that everybody would
flash a look-alike card and the officer ’would have no way
beyond, you know, apart from a very intensive investigation,
to determine whether it was really legitimate.
And so to that extent, Mr, Justice White, I suppose
it does relieve some of the pressure because there are a
number of people who do enter itfith visitor’s cards to which

25
they are not entitled but which are look-alikes and to that
extent they are intercepted if they carry them with them,
which they ordinarily do not.

They ordinarily mail them

back to Mexico for further use but if they carry them with
them, they are intercepted further on.
QUESTION:

Is a heavy-volume port-of-entry like

San Isidro open 24 hours a day?
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:
San Clemente

I don't --- yes, I gather it is.
Mr. Evans, turning to the procedure at

check point for a

moment, possibly you covered

this, looking at this picture, the large stop signs, is
every single vehicle stopped?
MR. EVANS:

There is some dispute between the

litigants here as to whether they are or not.

The records

in the consolidated District Court proceeding just doesn’t
speak to the question, at least not clearly.

The District

Court’s findings were that the most that a motorist is
subjected to is a fleeting stop.
We are informed by the border patrol here that —
that with the exception of those vehicles that are referred
bo secondary, very few come to a full stop except when
traffic is light and they are curious.

I mean, the sign does

say ’’stop" and they may stop but the officer wants to keep the
traffic moving and he motions with one hand and then the
other and then generally waves them through at four or five

26
miles per hour.
We may be disputed on that point by the other side
but I have no way of answering other than what I said.
I have referred to some of the smuggling that goes
on with respect to the transportation of illegal entrants.
The record shows that those smuggling operations have been
designed specifically to evade the check points and that an
alien who pays $200 to $300 for transportation to an inland
job market is paying for a safe trip through a check point.
One witness stated that without the check points
the smugglers would be out of business immediately.
Indeed., the mere cost of -- that a smuggler -- the
mere price that a smuggler charges is a very significant
deterrent to rr^ny of the persons who otherwise would be
tempted to come to this country.
As Judge Turrentine found, the average per capita
income of the poorest 40 percent of Mexican nationals is in
the range of $150,
There is another difference between checkpoints and
roving patrols that we think is significant and this is the
circumstances in which the intrusion occurs.
In both cases, of course, a vehicle is -— search
of a vehicle is limited to those places in which an alien or
a person could reasonably be concealed.
ne trunk*

That usually means

Sometimes they look in the hood for the reason

27
that these pictures demonstrate.
Sometimes they look under the car with a mirror
and occasionally they will have to do what they did in the
case of Almelda-Sanchez, which Is to look under the back
seat, particularly if there is something about the trunk
that makes them think there is a compartment there or If the
driver does not have a key to the trunk.
Unlike a roving patrol, however, in which an
officer patrols a large area stopping vehicles by pursuit
with siren and a flashing light, often at night, checkpoints
are stationary and their procedure Is more regularized and
the Fifth Circuit in the decision that I mentioned earlier
stated, in upholding a warrantless non-probable cause search
of a vehicle for aliens at a permanent checkpoint in Sierra
Blanca, Texas •— *'A permanent checkpoint," the Court said,
"does not have the constitutionally-frightening aspect of a
roving

patrol.

Similarly, there is less flexibility in the

operation of a checkpoint and less discretion is vested in
the officer himself who is limited to a single location which
has been established by senior officials of the Border Patrol."
That decision, I think, is subject to important
self-limiting constraints.
of man-power.

There is a very severe shortage

The officials who are responsible for locating

these checkpoints are highly motivated to place them in those
spots in which they can operate most effectively.

I am really not quite

clear but I am confident that that is not the normal proce1

significant arteries.

with that brief.

Well, again, I am told that

Perhaps I am wrong.
It is my understanding that that brief
I don’t know whether it was inadver­

tently not stamped or whether for some reason the delivery
didn’t take place, but my understanding was that it was and
it was served on counsel on Friday, I should add, although
counsel were en route from CAlifornia.
I was saying that the decision to locate a check­
point is not one that is the decision of a cop on the beat
and the
case.

Fifth Circuit aptly stated it

again in that same

The ease’s name, by the way, is Kart and it was

decided" January 15th, 1975.

30

The Court stated "At permanent checkpoints the
commitment of time, money, personnel and the administrative
decision for location of the search are all presumably such
as to remove, to a large extent, the individual arbitrariness
that might be available to roving agents."
And

we believe that the combination of these

three factors, the greatly increased need

for checkpoints

that are less frightening aspect of the intrusion contemplated
and the reduced discretion of the officers, at least with
respect to the place of the search themselves distinguish
checkpoint searches from roving patrol searches and should
make it possible for the court to honor the congressional
judgment that warrantless searches of vehicles for aliens,
if conducted within a reasonable distance of the border, are
necessary for the protection of our border against unauthorised
entries and are reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.
Indeed, we think that checkpoint searches bear
a very close resemblance to the searches that are, in fact,
made at the border, far more —
QUESTION:

Are these made at the 100 miles under the

regulations, [inaudible], in every case?
MR. EVANS:

No, no.

There may certainly be — if

a checkpoint were established in downtown Sail Diego, I don’t
think —*
QUESTION:

YOu could sustain it.

31
MR. EVANS:

I don’t think we would try to.

It

would be havoc, as the evidence shows with respect to a
checkpoint even outside the city but near major commuter
and shopping areas.
We suggest that the analysis of Mr. Justice White’s
dissent in Almeida-Sanchez, that Congress contemplated the
border for purposes of immigration law enforcement as a zone
rather than as a line is particularly apt here, though the
Court didn’t accept that analysis in the context of a search
conducted by roving patrol officers pursuing and stopping a
passing vehicle, we believe a different result is appropriate
here because the facts make the operation so much more
closely resembling the operations at the border itself.
QUESTION:

Well, I gather from some of the things

you say in your reply brief, particularly on page 9 of the
Ortiz brief, this in the line of what I was asking awhile
ago, indicates that it :1s perhaps impractical to really do
the job at the border at certain points, such as in the
Chula Vista.
MR. EVANS:
except that what

mb

Mr. Justice White, that is correct,
are talking about here is impractical

to do the job of protecting the borders other than the ports
of entry.

The Border Patrol’s line watch just can’t control

unauthorized entries at other than a port of entry.
That is the job that can’t be done at the border.

QUESTION:

So the reason why the line was at the

border, say, here in the southern California area, the reason
why that isn’t effective and you must supplement it is just
because of evasion.
MR. EVANS:

Essentially that is co?crect.

If every­

body presented — if every person who sought entrance to this
country presented himself for inspection at the border, there
would be no serious problem with Illegal entrance in this
country.
QUESTION:

Oh, I understand that but you seem to

think that somebody by making a traffic check 30 or 40 miles
inland can find something out from the flow of traffic that
he couldn’t find out at the border.

No, he could find it out at the border

QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:

Well, if you had .1,000 checkpoints —On the border itself.
On the border itself it wouldn’t solve

the problem of illegal entry.

The estimates in the testi­

mony in the District Court by the senior officers in the •
Border Patrol sector, that it would take just an enormous
army to control the potential of unlawful entry, if there is
someone there when they try the first time, as one officer
said, they’ll bounce off and try somewhere else.
QUESTION:
wR. EXANS:

Right.
And he estimated it would take 21,000

men to cover his sector of 1^5 miles.
QUESTION:

Mr. Evans, since I have interrupted you,

36
let me come back to the legal problem.

I understand the

Government’s position and that is that no warrant procedure
of any kind is necessary for a fixed checkpoint.

But let's

assume for the moment that the Court does not accept that
position.
What about a warrant procedure authorization by a
district judge for the maintaining of a checkpoint after the
judge has been convinced that facts and circumstances justify
it?
MR. EVANS:

Mr. Justice Powell, our principal

contention, as you have Indicated,is that no warrants were
needed.

If we lose that, we consider it essential that the

Court make it plain — if it can properly do so — that a
warrant could properly be issued.
We have had very serious problems with respect to
the checkpoint — with respect to the checkpoint warrants
that have been issued in the Ninth Circuit following its
decision in Bowen and then in Brignon1-Ponce,

which is the

next case.
Some judges think that warrants are not permitted
by the Fourth Amendment.

As Mr. Patton indicated, one of

the principal checkpoints in California has been closed for
quite a long time now because one judge said that he didn’t
think he had authority to
QUESTION:

issue a warrant.

Which one was that?

37
MR. EVANS:

This is Temecula, which is the

second one over, I believe, from ohe ocean.
QUESTION:

If this Court said that the district

judges had authority, that would solve that problem.
What other problems are there?
MR. EVANS:

Right.

There are other problems.

We have found that nearly all the magistrates and judges
have been requiring statistical showings for particular
checkpoints that are just simply impossible to meet.
These checkpoints are designed as deterrents and
the more effective they are as deterrents, the fewer the
apprehensions there are going to be and as a consequence,
we have had to shut down essential but less frequentlytravelled checkpoints because — in three cases — because
the warrants were refused on the grounds these statistics
were inadequate.
QUESTION:

Well, why did you shut them down because

of the refusal of the warrant when your contention is you
don’t need the warrant?
MR. EVANS:

Well, the Ninth Circuit has ruled that

we cannot —
QUESTION:

This is after post-Bowen.

MR. EVANS: This is post-Bowen. We didn't start

until they decided Bowen, which held that checkpoints
could not be — checkpoint searches could not be conducted

38
without warrants and then Brignonl-Ponce, which was soon
followed by a decision that said that checkpoint stops could
not be conducted without warrants.
QUESTION:

Mr. Evans, have any of these refusals

taken into account the distance of a particular checkpoint?

QUESTION:

Do you think, that would be a relevant

c ons i de r at i on ?
MR. EVANS:

I think it would be, certainly I think

the whole geographic situation is relevant.
There is another problem we have had and that is
that the warrants have been issued in every case for 10 days
at the most and that 10-day period makes it necessary
repeatedly to get approval of the same warrant

even though

its operation, procedure and location have not changed a whit.
QUESTION:

What kind of a warrant are you referring

to now, exactly?
MR. EVANS:

Well, the warrants that have been issued

in the Ninth — that is another problem.

The Ninth Circuit

warrants' have been limited solely to warrants authorizing the

39
stopping of vehicles for purposes of inquiring as to the
citizenship of the occupants.
There has been no authority granted to conduct the
kind of searches the Border Patrol considers are essential
to its enforcement scheme and these warrants say nothing
more, essentially, than "You are commended to conduct a
checkpoint and you are authorized to stop any northbound
vehicle during your hours of operation to inquire as to the
citizenship of the occupants. !i
QUESTION:

I take it there is no suggestion from

the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that you need anything in
the nature of a warrant for the port of entry stop.
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:

That is correct.
And complete search.
That is correct.

Well, there are some

limits as to body cavity searches, for example.
QUESTION:

Well, is there some suggestion in

Bowen that the warrants would not be authorised?
MR. EVANS:

Bowen left the issue open.

It stated

we do not have to reach that issue, much as this Court left
it open in Almelda-Sanehez but there have been, as I have
said — we've lost a checkpoint in essential district —
that is actually an essential district although it was
treated in this manner.

Now, in the Fifth and Tenth Circuits, the check­
points have been operated without warrants, pursuant to the
procedure that had been followed in the past because those
circuits have, up until recently, the Fifth Circuit hadn‘t
ruled on it.

It has now ruled that permanent checkpoints

are lawful, at least upheld one and its decision can cer­
tainly be read broadly enough to uphold the rest and the
Tenth Circuit, while it held in King and Maddox.that the
principals of Almeida-Sanchez should apply to roving — to
checkpoints, what it said was —— in essence — was that you
can’t conduct a checkpoint search without warrant, without
probable cause unless it is at the functional equivalent of
\
the border.

It remanded to the Distract Court to define that terrg
which it didn't attempt to do and that was the 98 miles from
the border checkpoint involved and so at least that circuit is
completely open.
’■

We haven't contended for that definition of

functional equivalence here.

We think the Ninth Circuit

correctly read that phrase but at least that circuit hasn’t
ruled that that checkpoint or the others within it are unlaw­
fully- operated so we have been operating them ^without warrants.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Evans.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES M. SEVILLA, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT ORTIZ
MR. SEVILLA:

Mr.

Chief Justice and may it please

the Court;
I think Mr. Evans has outlined adequately the facts
of this case and the issues involved but I would like to
address immediately some of the statements which we take
issue with.
First of all, in comparing a roving to a fixed
check, we have to look at the nature of the intrusion
involved.
In each case, we are involved with a search which
takes place because of the unfettered exercise of discretion
by a Border Patrol officer at a checkpoint who decides without

43
any criteria whatsoever that he Is going to select che car,
refer it to secondary and conduct a full search of the car.
And that —
QUESTION:
searches, which

You mean there are searches, stops and

you would consider lawful at the port oi

entry, I take it?
MR. SEVILLA:
QUESTION:

No question about that.

But if they are 10 miles or 20 miles or

30 miles interior, then they require a warrant, you say.
MR. SEVILLA:
the

Then I would have a question because

question would then be, is this the functional equiva­

lent of the border.
Now, the Government has cited the Hart case for the
proposition that the Fifth Circuit says that, well, all
check points are valid but that is not true.

The Fifth

Circuit said that the Sierra Blanca checkpoint, located some
10 miles north of the border, was the. functional equivalent
of the border and we would say that if a checkpoint is the
functional equivalent of the border, no warrant is necessary
because, obviously, the same type of powers would emanate
for a functional equivalent checkpoint as a point of entry.
Now, with some limitations which Is for body
searches'.
QUESTION:

Well, what criteria do you suggest for

the determination of functional equivalence?

44
MR. SEVILLA: Well, I think the Hart ease listed
several.

It should be the first functional

point of entry.

Now., the Sierra Blanca checkpoint — we have two
checkpoints — pardon me, two ports of entry on the TexasMexico border which were closed, down and the checkpoint
located some 10 miles north in between those two checkpoints
was the first

functional point of entry for all of the people

traversing through that area and I think that is a legitimate
QUESTION:

But if they had been opened and not

closed down on the border, then what?
MR.SEVILLA: Than it would not be the functional
equivalent of the border in -QUESTION:

What you are really saying --

MR. SEVILLA:

— [inaudible] recognized except by

not opening it for a checkpoint ■—
QUESTION:

— Is, it is, in effect, a substitute

for closed border.
MR, SEVILLA:

That is true but it is not necessarily

so because we only have two ports of entry such as in Califor­
nia and the southern district; one in Calexico and one in San
Isidro.
Novr, the functional equivalent of the border could
also just say somewhere between those two points or somewhere
between the Calexico port of entry and the Yuma port of entry
where there is really no port of entry involved, but yet there

45
are, say, rural roads which are leading from the border in
which a lot of border traffic traverses so that can also be
the functional equivalent of the border.
QUESTION:

You are suggesting that if a checkpoint

would pick up traffic that reasonably might not go through a
port of entry, it is the functional equivalent of a border.
MR. SEVILLA:

That is true but it would have to

bear the criteria such as, it should be reasonably related
to the border in terms of distance.

I don’t think — for

Instance, in this case we are talking-about a checkpoint 66
miles north of a port of entry.
This checkpoint at San Clemente is 66 miles north
of the San ysidro port of entry and I'd really take issue
with the Government's contention that they don’t want to
disrupt commuter traffic.

That is exactly what is involved

at the San Clemente checkpoint where some 10 million cars
traverse north from San Diego to Los Angeles

and a very few,

as we say, a trickle of traffic, emanates from the border and
goes through San Clemente and we must also look to the fact
that 99 «9 percent of the vehicles, according to a statistical
sample, taken from Border Patrol affidavits, 99.9 percent
of the Vehicles contain

no immigration lav; violators at all

so I think these are relevant criteria in assessing the
reasonableness of the checkpoints in this case.
I would also, getting back to tht

distinction

46
between a roving and a fixed checkpoint, we have got to look,
one, there is unfettered discretion exercised by the officer
at the point.
Now., there is a discrepancy as to whether a stop
takes place.

I ifould simply rely on the pictures submitted

by the Government in this case.
It says, "All traffic stop here."

There is a Border

Patrolman with a stop sign a mile down the road that says,
"All traffic prepare to stop" and

in

the Government’s

opening brief, It makes allusion to the Baca hearings where
11.;.-. Courk. specifically .laid out ail of the procedures to
notify the oncoming

traffic that they are going to be stopped

ahead.
Now, for those individuals who are lucky enough to
pass the unfettered discretion of the point officer* and make
1g t-hrough, that is fine but then there is a significant
amour', of traffic that is referred, based on no articulable
basis except, as the Government says, the "ESP powers or the
sixth sense powers" of the point officer.
Xx; olie exercj.se of his sixth sense, he refers some
r

cars over to the secondary for a full search of the trunk,
the hood area and under the front seat.

1 IiUSht add that this is conducted by armed officers
-'..n uniform who, as the consolidated hearings made plain,, are
n0v administrative officers.

They are law enforcement

47
officers carrying 357 magnums and when a car is referred to
the secondary area, one officer approaches the passenger
side.

One officer approaches the driver’s side and orders

the individual out, orders him to open his trunk, orders
him to open the hood and then the inspection of the interior
may take place so this is hardly a situation where the
protection of the Fourth Amendment should be abandoned and
as this Court said in Calandra, the need for deterrence and
hence the rationale for excluding evidence are strongest
where the Government’s unlawful conduct would result in
imposition of a criminal sanction on the victim of the
search and that is exactly what is involved here.
The victim of the search in this case was Mr. Ortis.
A search took place which was unlawful after Alroeida-Sanchez
made it clear that probable cause was required for a search
not

at the functional equivalent of the border and not-

authorized by a warrant.
Nevertheless, the search took place.

Evidence

was discovered which led to the conviction of Mr. Ortiz.
With respect to the issue of the card holders,
initially Mr. Evans said, well, they are not the problem
but in addressing Justice Powell he said, "Well, they are the
problem.

That is one of the key criteria for the establish­

ment of a checkpoint.11
Our brief makes quite clear that the INS has

48
represented to the Congress of the United States that you
can't equate the problems of the 1186 cardholders with the
surreptitious entrance because the 1186 cardholders treasure
the card that gives them the right to enter the United States.
They enter at a port of entry.

They do not use

smugglers because they can enter legally and further, INS
statistics also reveal that all checkpoint operations in
Fiscal 1973 accounted for .003 percent of the people who had
1186 cards.
It is simply not a problem at the checkpoints.
Of the over over half-million illegal aliens
captured in 1973, I think something less than 5,000 were 1186
cardholders abusing their privilege.

They are not the problem.

suid the Government has two problems with that

argument.
Checkpoint s were not established to control 1186
cardholders because, as fcne decusion of the Tenth Circuit in
'io a-Rod rigues makes clear, 1186 cardholders up until just a
few years ago could travel up to 150 miles north of the border
so therefore, a checkpoint up until very recently when that
restriction was brought down to 25 miles, a checkpoint was
utterly useless in monitoring that type of traffic.

Further, the Government has a bootstrap argument
with 1186 cardholders because it is the Government that is
is&uing those cards and it would be rather ironic reasoning

43
to allow the Government to conduct these massive roadblocks
based on the issuance of cards which they have a perfect
right either not to issue at all or to issue in a more
restrictive manner.
But I don't think the 1186 card rationale applies
at all in this case.
And I might also add when we are talking about the
distinction between a roving and a fixed checkpoints that the
Bowen Court, of course, found a significant degree of
discretion with the point officer in selecting whom he would
select for the more intrusive-type search and it is certainly
not a modest intrusion for an individual to be travelling
55 miles an hour on an interstate freeway, perhaps never
having even come close to the border and then to be ordered
off the freeway by an armed officer and this intrusive sort
of search conducted.
In this case, there is no evidence that Mr. Ortiz
ever went closer than 50 miles north of the border.

The

only evidence in the stipulated facts trial is that Mr. Ortiz
picked up three aliens in Oceanside, California whom he knew

to have entered within three years.
That is the only time and^ place nexus which
connects this search to the border, unlike the AlmeidaSanchez case where the officers at the time they conducted
uhe search knew that Almeida-Sanchez

had Just come from the

50
border.
And this

is sort of typical of the blanket dragnet

type of search and seizure policy that goes on at the check­
points .
Another problem I have with the Government’s infor­
mation, relying on the INS-provided map is in the first map I
am sort of glad the Court doesn’t have the map because It is
really inaccurate.
The Government says that there are 12 checkpoints in
the southern district of California.

The testimony by the

two agents who ran all the cehckpoints in the southern district
of California indicated that there were nine such checkpoints.
The Government has indicated -in the maps to this
Court that three agricultural stations

located on the Arizona-

California border are immigration checkpoints established by
the INS.
Another one, one located in Tecate, California,
number four, simply does not exist.
And so that is unfortunate that took place but the
record clearly reflects that there are nine and where they
are located.
Now, I might further add that if this Court sees
fit to apply the probable cause standard to the search that
took place in this case as it should, since it is directly —
the analogy is clear to Almeida-Sanchez and Carroll versus

51
the United States but not all checkpoints are immediately
going to collapse.

This checkpoint is simply unreasonable.

It doesn't come close to meeting the requirements of a
functional equivalent, 99.9 percent of the traffic, according
to INS statistics, contains no immigration law violators,
96 percent of those searched at this checkpoint are not
violating any law.
It is really a massive intrusion and sort of a
blanket

Is there a search of the person or Is it just of

MR. SEVILLA:

It is not of the person.

It would

52
be of the ear area ostensibly inhere an alien could be hidden
but of course, since INS officers are also customs officers,
sometimes their delineation between where they can search for
aliens and where they can search for contraband becomes con­
fused and we have cases where aliens are — where the INS
officer .is searching for an alien in a jacket or in a package
of cigarettes.
I have cited those cases in the brief.
And that is the unreasonable distinction between
the powers.

I think, as a customs officer is guided by

probable cause when he is dealing with the situation not at
uhe j.uncclonal equivalent of the border, so should an

But whereever it is the functional

There may be some limitation as to the extent

of the search but certainly the search for aliens would be
unquestioned at the functional equivalent of the border mid
•i. would submix; that the Fifth Circuit has already found two
oj.

the checkpoints on the map submitted to the court to be the

functional equivalent of the border and so it is really an
unwarranted inference to believe that declaring the

unreason­

able checkpoint at San Clemente illegal, that that would have

a domino effect on other checkpoints.

We are only dealing

with the San Clemente checkpoint.
Now, the Government’s theory which it brings to
this

Court, for the first time I might add, since it didn’t

bring it before the District Court or the Court of Appeals,
is that there is a functional equivalent of probable cause
in this area.
Nov;, Justice Powell 1s the only member of this Court
who has spoken to the relatively-unstrueturedconcept of the
functional equivalent of probable cause but I might just go
over the five criteria that Justice Powell talked to and
demonstrate how the Government has not addressed any of those.
Number one, there was a warrant requirement because
this is the concept where certainly a judicial officer should
make the determination and not a border patrolman standing
66 miles' north of the border determining a legal concept such
as the functional equivalent probable cause.
Second, the distance from the border, 66 miles in
this case and the geographic characteristics.
The geographic characteristics in this area, we
have an interstate freeway where commuter traffic between
San Diego and Los Angeles is interrupted.

This is not the —

1 do not believe this is what Justice Powell was talking to
in his concurring opinion because after the mention was made
of geographic characteristics there was a footnote to the

54
problem along the border and that is that there are

vast

areass rural, desert areas where there are no points oi
ports of entry and yet there are means for aliens to
surreptitiously enter.
This isn't the situation here.

Here we have a

checkpoint north of the second largest city ox Calixornia
and north of about 18 other cit5.es along the coast and jusc
south of Los Angeles so it has nothing to do, really, with
border enforcement and as a matter of fact, the only people
who would be coming from the border on 1-5, many of them
of course, would have gone through the San Isidro port of
entry.
The most important criteria that Justice Powell
talked to was the interference with the rights of the
innocent and I won’t repeat the 99.9 percent figure again
as to the people who are violating the l&w when' they pass
through "the checkpoint so on these criteria certainly chore is
no functional equivalent of probable cause and when the
Government says, oh, we have had a problem getting a warrant
for this checkpoint, well, it is no wonder„
They certainly haven'-t established a functional
equivalent of probable cause unless that is to. be a really
meaningless concept because if it is functional and equivalent,
there should be some probability that the people going to
that checkpoint are violating the law.

That is what

55
probabilities are all about but in this case it is less
than l/10th of a percent of the vehicles going through the
checkpoint.
I must -- I’ve got tvro minutes before lunch.

I'll

try to make that time deadline.
I might address myself to the Camara concept which
the Government has also sought to take refuge under.
In Camara the intrusion was that of an administra­
tive clerk who went to a home to look for housing code
violation.
The first people who were found in violation were
not prosecuted for felonies as Mr. Ortiz was, which carries
a maximum penalty of five years per alien.

As a matter of

fact, as a matter of course, they weren't prosecuted at all.
Whereas the Government can now make a claim to this
Court that the transporters of aliens are not prosecuted when
they are found, as a matter of course they must be.

They

have to be prosecuted and so we have a strict law enforcement
procedure going forth.
As Magistrate McCue testified at the consolidated
hearings', two magistrates in our district in 1972 and 1973
handled 7,000 immigration violations which were really trans­
portation of alien charges —

Thank you, your Honor.

AFTERNOON SESSION
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. SEVILLA:

Mr. Sevilla.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
I believe I was discussing the criminal investigative nature of the San Clemente checkpoints and discussing
Magistrate McCue’s testimony which is reflected in our brief
concerning the thousands of prosecutions in our district for
transportation of illegal aliens based upon the arrest of
persons by immigrations officers on highways in the interior
of the State of California.
■

If I may rely on our brief with respect to the

details as to that testimony, I would like to discuss — after
discussion vrith the Petitioner — my allusion to the three
c heckpolnts located on the border between Arizona and
California

located in the map number one provided by the

Government.
QUESTION:

We don’t have that map.

MR. SEVILLA:

Maybe that is just as well.

The

Government asserts that the three checkpoints which are rather
clearly delineated as being in the El Centro sector on this
map are, in fact, in Arizona.

57
However, I would point out that these three check­
points are California agricultural stations which the
Petitioner informs me that an Immigration officer is
stationed at this California agricultural station to check
for aliens so I don’t want to leave any misrepresentations
in the record*
However, I would state that this is one of the
problems when the Government goes outside the record to
supply this Court information in a non-adversary proceedings,
especially when one of the parties is supplying the infor­
mation.
The Government had its opportunity at the consoli­
dated hearings to provide this information and I think they
should stick with that record.
The Government makes a big point about the need of
the checkpoints.

The question in this case is not whether or

not. searches for illegal aliens can take place at all.

It

is whether they can take place with probable cause or based
upon a warrant or based upon the functional equivalent of
probable cause or based upon a checkpoint at the functional
equivalent of the border.
But in addition to those alternatives, the Border
Patrol has at least eight or nine other programs which they
use to capture illegally-entering aliens.

That includes the

line watch, roving patrols near the border, the farm

58
investigations„ transportation terminal checking procedures,
metropolitan investigations and I’ll stop at metropolitan
investigations because in a 20-day period in the City of Los
Angeles a handful of Immigration inspectors swept through
evidently a barrio in Los Angeles area and captured 20,000
illegal 'aliens.

That is more --

QUESTION:

What percentage is that of the total

entries — entrants is that, would you say?
MR. SEVILLA:

Well, by comparison, an entire year

at the San Clemente checkpoint, between 12 and 16,000 were
captured.

About a half a million total were captured in

Fiscal. ’73 but in a 20-day working period, the INS was able
to capture 20,000 in the City of Los Arigples, which sort of
detracts from the theory that the Government wid.! be unable
to discover illegal aliens once they have crossed the border
which is, ox course, the first line where the /border patrol
should be watching with increased

vigori-

I might also point

to the record which establishes that the entire CAlifornia~
wexj.co border, during a typical day is guardedly 30 Border
rawol agents and there are nine inland checkpoints in the
Southen! District of California which take away, obviously,
a s.*.gaificanc amount of manpower from the border.
At; Sail Clemente there are 4 7 Border Patrol agents
assigned there for a ful day activity and you can multiply
kuoifc by a factor of nine although I am sure there are lesser

numbers assigned to the other chekcpolnts.
QUESTION:

Well, from what you are saying now and

what you have in your

briefs and other

briefs on this

score, I take it that you think that they aren't doing their
;Job very well.
MR. SEVILLA:

Well, they have a significant problem.

There is a massive intrusion of illegal aliens.

I am saying

that there is no need to dismantle the Constitution to
discover illegal aliens when there are so many alternatives
available and I
QUESTION;

Well, now, when they go through the

barrio, presumably, it is a grand, sttfeep, V dragnet.
MR. SEVILLA:
QUESTION:

Well, if an ~

Can an alien move to suppress the

evidence of his illegal presence in the country by reason of
the fact that he was seised in an illegal search?
MR. SEVILLA:

He very probably could but as this

Court pointed out in Terry versus Ohio, any law enforcement
officer can approach any resident of this country

ask

him a question, ’’Where are your papers?”
QUESTION:

Well, dc you think «—

MR. SEVILLA:

A person doesn’t have to answer, but

if he answers and says, "I don't have any papers," that
provides a basio for excluding him from the country.
The point is that there are other

viable

60
alternatives such as the industrial checks, the boat and stow­
away checking, at cetera as well as the doctrine of founded
suspicion to stop a car which we have on our warrant and
that is --- those cases are cited in the brief.

That Involves

roving Border Patrol cars in the border area looking

for

suspicious-looking cars and if there Is an articulable basis
to stop the car, it is permitted.
In addition, there is the governmental agency inter­
play involving the IRS, Social Security and HEW which allows
the agencies to detect the aliens once they have make it to
the cities ana are now applying for governmental benefits and,
of course, the greatest deterrent of all would be passage by
Congress of the Rodino Bill which would make the knowing
employment, of an illegal alien unlawful and there is where the
real deterrent rests.
It is up to Congress and I think that given the
significant burdens of the Border Patrol, nobody is denying
that.

It is up to Congress to give them the constitutional

tools with which to deal with the problem.
QUESTION:

Mr. Sevilla.

MR. SEVILLA:
QUESTION:

Yes.

11 I understand what you are now saying,

y°tt disagree with the findings that were made by the District
Court in the consolidated hearing I have before me at page
l8~a of the petition for the writ in which the district judge

61
said the primary reason for their operation, that is, the
checkpoint, is that they effectively deter large numbers of
aliens from illegally entering the country.
Do I understand that you controvert that finding?
MR. SEVILLA:
record reflects that.

I certainly do and I think the
In that consolidated hearing, of

course, the Border Patrolman said, we believe it is a
deterrent,
But I think the record reflects that, the fact
that the Immigration Commissioner indicated that there are
some 10 million illegal aliens here today shows that the
checkpoints are an obstacle but an easily-evaded obstacle.
QUESTION:

Right, but one must consider alternatives

and the district judge also found on page 20a that there is
no reasonable or effective alternative method of detection
and apprehension available to the Border Patrol.
I understand you disagree with that, also.
MR. SEVILLA:

Well, I not only disagree with it,

your Honor, but the Ninth Circuit in the Bowen case said
that the Government is not going to be rendered helpless If
they strike the type of search activity that took place in
this case„
There are alternatives.

I have outlined just a

few of them and I am sure the imaginative use of other
alternatives would be —-

62
QUESTION:

Is it your position that there is no

substantial evidence to support those findings of the District
Court?
MR. SEVILLA:

I would say that is true.

For

instances I cite in the brief the statistic that San Clemente
checkpoint captures only five percent of the illegal alien
traffic going through it.

With that efficiency ratio it is

hardly deterrent to illegal aliens passing through that area.
In closing, I would just state Mr. Nasatir is going
to address the retroactivity question with respect to check­
points but on page 12 and 13 of the reply brief of either
petitioner, there is a statement concerning the appearance of
persons of Mexican residence .
The Petitioner has asserted that Border Patrol
officers using their sixth sense powers of extrasensory
Perception can determine merely by a quick visual glance at
a person coming In a. vehicle on an interstate highway whether
that person is an illegal alien from Mexico or a lawful
permanent resident from Mexico or a Mexican—Airtiprican citizen
and they can make that distinction sufficiently clear to
cause a referral to secondary basically only where there is a
reasonable suspicion of unlawful alienage.
If we read, the characteristics that the Government
asserts on page 12 and 13 describing the illegal Mexican
aliens, 1 think it would be safe to say.

as the Ninth Circuit

63
has said — and it has taken judicial notice — that it is
impossible, based on an appearance of an individual to tell
whether he is here legally or illegally and, in fact, of
course, the Imperial County is 52 percent Mexican-Ameriean
in the southern district.
San Diego County, which has a population of a
million and a half is 13 percent Mexican-American.

Los

Angeles has the largest Mexican-American population in the
northern hemisphere outside of Mexico City.
Now, these people have a right to uninterrupted
travel and not to be referred to secondary because some
Border Patrolmen think they may be illegal aliens.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Sevilla.

Mr. Nasatir.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL D. NASATIR, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF BOWEN
MR. NASATIR:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
First of all, I would like to make the record
perfectly clear that this Petitioner does not concede that
section 1357 is the only statute or is a statute upon which
fclle Border Patrol could rely upon for these checkpoints and
'l~

-sruainly is not a bas^s for reliance In terms of the

clear past precedent of this Court and is not a basis

64
for reliance in terms of the clear past precedent of this
Court and is not a basis of reliance even under the statutory
scheme.
Section 1225a of Title VIII supplied the Border
Patrol with the right to search at the border.
Section 1357, which is the section that Justice
White referred to in the argument on the first case, Peltier,
is merely a statute which enables the Border Patrol to board
vehicles within a reasonable distance from the border without
a warrant.
Neither of these statutes, it is clear from a mere
reading o>. them, requires a dispensation with traditional
reliance upon probable cause.
QUESTION:

What permits the dispensing with it at

the border?
MR, NASATIR:

Section 1225a of Title VIII, your

Honor, which is cited at
QUESTION:

So your position

your position is

chat the statute itself does ■— on its face or any other way ——
doesn’t purport to authorise non-probable cause searches.
MR. NASATIR:
QUESTION:

Anywhere.

MR. NASATIR:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Anywhere,

At the border or any place else.

MR. NASATIR:

No, sir, because Section 1225a,

65
presently Section 1225a, which is cited at page 22 of the
brief in Brignoni-Ponce, footnote 11, is the statute which
enables Immigration officers to board and search cars in
which they believe aliens are being brought into the country.
This is the enabling statute which allows them to search at
the border.
1357 merely allows what Justice Stewart found in
Almelda-Sanchez, a search within a reasonable distance from
the border which I think commonsense would have told the
Immigration and Naturalisation Service at the time does not
mean that the necessity of probable cause is dispensed with,
merely reasonable distance from the border and certainly not
some 45 to 50 miles from the border as was the case in
Bowen or some 60 miles, as was the case In Ortiz.
So certainly we do not concede that this statute,
either on. Its face or any reasonable interpretation of it
by lawyers for the Immigration and Naturalization Service
trained in the law to advise these officer's to conclude that
the probable cause requirement Imposed by the Fourth Amendment
since the inception of this country could be dispensed with.
And I hope that the record Is perfectly clear as
to that lack of a concession and in fact, a reading of the
statutes, of both statutes, would show that 1225a enabled
them to search at the border still with

— if they believe

aliens are corning in and 1357 allows them to search within a

66
reasonable distance from the border if they have probable
cause.
They can search it without a warrant in both cases,
certainly.
Every

Fourth Amendment case, of course, turns

upon its facts and in this case, the facts of Mr. Bowen are
those that every citizen in the United States, I submit, who
chooses to travel in a hunting and fishing agricultural area
of Highway 86 — in A lme id a- S an che z, if you x-d.ll remember,
after he was stopped, Mr. AlmeIda-S an che z identified himself
as a resident of Mexico.

He told the Border Patrol that he

picked up a car at the border, that he had Just come from
Mexico and that he intended to return to the border on this
trip.
Mr. Boxtfen was stopped.

He identified himself as an

American citizen, a citizen of the United States.
The officer testified there was no evidence that he
had come to Mexico, noone had seen him come to Mexico.
wasn’t asked questions whether he was coming to Mexico.

He
He

was merely ordered to open the back of his camper.
Also in Bowen, as distinguished from Almeida-Sanchez
even, an even stronger fact, Mr. Bowen was driving a camper
which we all know is, to some people, their home on wheels,
expecially their vacation home.
The Border Patrolman in Bowen, as far as he knew,

could have discovered Mr. Bowen's wife or his children
sleeping in the bach and disturbed them.

He could have

discovered a guest of Mr. Bowen sleeping in the back or doing
any of the other private things which we know are done in
campers, including toilet habits or any other private thing
you do in your house.
There was nothing in the nature of Bowen's car,
nothing in the nature of his appearance, racial or otherwise,
and nothing in the nature of his statements to the Border
Patrol which would indicate anything other than he was a
vacationing traveller in this recreation area next to the
Salton Sea which is a prime fishing area in the Southern
California area.
The nature of this search, as shown by the Bowen
facts, is that that of an arbitrary one, giving complete
discretion to the Border Patrol.
As I stated before, there is no showing whatso­
ever that Bowen or his vehicle had ever been to Mexico.

Of

course, a reasonable interpretation of the Border Patrol's
power in this case, that is, functional equivalent of the
border, would have provided this nexus but they didn't have
it here.
They had a regulation enacted by the INS itself
which 3aid that, well, what is reasonable is 100 miles and I
think we can all agree where that 100 miles was picked from.

68
It!s an arbitrary figure, having nothing to do with nexus to
the border or functional equivalent.
Commonsense would tell us that when Congress enacted
a statute in light of the Fourth Amendment, and in light of
the Carroll line of cases from this Court and without express
authorization, that Congress never meant to waive the probable
cause requirements of the search and without this statutory
justification, without reasonable reliance, certainly this
case presents no retroactivity question.
It presents no retroactivity question because It
doesn't overrule clear past precedent because what is the
precedent if it is not the statute as I have already argued.
The precedent is merely a self-serving regulation
enacted by the Immigration and Naturalization Service but was
this a precedent for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service?
If you would see the record in the Baca hearings,
you would see that these checkpoints have been in existence
since 19*25.

Now, from 1925 to 1946 when Section 1357 was

enacted,’ there was no statutory authorization for these check­
points whatsoever.
The Immigration and Naturalization Service took it
upon themselves to stop and search travellers anywhere within
QUESTION;

That depends on whether you think 1225 is

empowering people to search vehicles applies only to the

69
border.
MR. NASATIR:

I think a fair reading of 1225 is

just that, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, that is what I say.

That is the

way you interpret it.
MR. NASATIR:

Yes, and I think that is the way

that reasonable minds would have Interpreted that in light
of the probable cause requirement of the Fourth Amendment
and this Court's Carroll line of cases.
Not only does —
QUESTION:

What's the “Carolina” cases?

the Carroll line of cases.
MR. NASATIR:

I see.

Oh, it’s

I see.

Yes, your Honor, beginning with the

Carroll case as cited by this Court —
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. NASATIR:
really, is true.

I misunderstood you.

— in 1925.

Just the opposite,

The clear past precedent was Carroll and

an opposite result was compared with — was compelled by
Carroll.

Certainly the past precedent was not clear even In

the Ninth Circuit.
As you can see, every case before 1970 in the
Ninth Circuit not only discussed the stop of these travellers
on the highway but discussed probable cause also and each
and every case prior to 1970 required a discussion of that
probable cause to justify that search and they did that in

70

each and every case.
In 1970, Fumagalll came along and in 1970, when
Alme1da-Sanchez was searched, that lawyer took that case to
this Court and it was then decided.
So

certainly, the precedent in the Ninth Circuit

was far from clear, as Is so ably pointed out by Justice
Huffs tedder in her dissent in the Bowen case.
QUESTION:

What about' the majority opinion, if it

is so clear?
MR. NASATIR:

The majority opinion, I fear, was

mistaken in the fact that they mistook the Fumagain line of
cases as clear past precedent when you ~~
QUESTION:

You are painting a picture here of con­

sistency In the Ninth Circuit and yet you have a substantial
number of votes of the present circuit judges the other way.
QUESTION;

I believe that a close reading of the

cases leading up to Fumagalll showed that probable cause was
required up until Fumagalll, certainly

until — not the

beginning of the line of cases even cited by the Ninth Circuits
your Honor, was' in 1963.
If you want to — that is the beginning of even the
cases which discussed probable cause and required probable
cause In their discussions in order to affirm the opinions
upon which the Ninth Circuit relied.
But not only that, your Honor.

I think, as the

71
final arbiter of constitutional rules this Court must be
looked to as the Court which defines constitutional prin­
ciples .
Certainly, the Ninth Circuit cannot be the definer
of constitutional principles because the Tenth Circuit,
right next door, might define them differently and that
would lack uniformity.

Anyone who looked to the Supreme

Court for guidance in this case would have found Carroll
and would have found probable ca.use certainly controlled the
statute
The Ninth Circuit also spoke to the fact that this
was a long-established widely-relied upon practice as defined
by previous decisions.
Now, the previous decisions, I submit, that were
talked about in Milton versus Walnwrlght, were the decisions
of this Court, not the decisions of the lower court.
But, secondly of all, this is not a widely-reliedupon practice.

No other law enforcement agency in the United

States but the Immigration and Naturalization Service relied
upon this practice.
‘The Immigration and Naturalization Service enacted
a regulation which, I submit, had the drafters of that
regulation been — and not haphazard, would have found the
Carroll line of cases which limited searches without warrants
to reasonable distances from the border and then and only

72

then with probable cause.
QUESTION:

Mr, Nasatir, we are talking here, I take

.it, about the retroactivity of the Ninth Circuit decision
in Bowen.
MR. NASATIR:

We are talking here about the retro—

the lack of retroactivity analysis even having to be made,
your Honor, beccause clear past precedent

supported the fact

that — always has supported the fact —- clear past precedent
from this Court.
QUESTION:
I think.

have
Well, I/heard that part of the argument,

What I was trying to direct your attention to was.

the focus isn’t on the retroactivity of any decision of this
Court but on a decision of the Ninth Circuit.
MR. NASATIR:

The Ninth Circuit held, your Honor,

thar Bowen was not entitled to the benefit of the decision
outlying checkpoints.
that Bowen

What I am saying to this Court is,

is entitled to the benefit of the CArroll line of

cases and the cases that have always held that the Fourth
Amendment applies to searches well within our borders.
QUESTION:

Don’t you see some difficulty — and I

would think perhaps if you see some difficulty, it might just
as well help your client as hinder him — in carrying over
retroactivity analysis that has been applied in decisions of
tnrs Court down to Courts of Appeals decisions and presumably
ultimately to the District Court so that you have different

73
rules presumably in every judicial district in the United
States.
MR. NASATIR:

I do see that difficulty, your

Honor.
QUESTION:

How would you propose that it be solved?

MR. NASATIR:

I would propose first that it be

solved by having no retroactivity analysis at all, by
declaring that that has always been the law, as was declared
In Almeida-Sanchez, clearly, and that checkpoint searches are
certainly no different than Almeida-Sanchez.
QUESTION:

Well, that is fine for your particular

case but all that would give us is a case-by-case analysis
not just of our own precedents but ultimately of the Courts
of Appeals decisions and presumably then the Courts of
Appeals are going to have to analyze the District Courts’
decisions to see whether they should be retroactive from a
particular time.
I think perhaps something more than that just
urging that here the thing should be nonretroactive may be
required.
MR. NASATIR:
QUESTION:

Well —

1 think, as I have understood your

Rehnquist’s question by saying that the court to look to is

MR. NASATIR:
QUESTION:

That is precisely what I was saying.

And that is what Judge Hufstedler said

In her separate opinion that otherwise something will be one
way in one circuits one way In another, one way in one dis­
trict of a circuit, one way in another.
MR. NASATIR:
QUESTION:

That Is correct, your Honor.

The ony place where retroactivity —

where you even get into the question is if you see that this
Court had overruled a long-settled previous precedent or
practice'.
MR. NASATIR:
QUESTION:

That is exactly my argument and I —

The difficulty is that Bowen isn’t a

decision of this Court.
QUESTION:

Well, even the Government concedes, as I

understand it, that — that Bowen — that the Court of Appeals
was wrong in saying that Bowen was not entitled to its
judgment.

The Government quarrels with its judgment, the

Court of Appeals judgment, but says that if the judgment is
correct, Bowan would have been the beneficiary of it.
MR. NASATIR:
QUESTION:

But not because it should be retroactive.

MR. NASATIR:
been the law.

That is correct.

No, your Honor, because it has always

That is my point and also, of course —

QUESTION:

It Is the Government’s point.

MR. NASATIR:

No,' it Is not the Government’s point.

75
What the Government’s point iss is because Bowen
was the litigant in the Ninth Circuit and because the Ninth
Circuit found — because the Ninth Circuit decided the
Bowen case, that that should be the basis for all decisions
in the Ninth Circuit.
I submit, certainly,

if

that is the judgment of

this Court, that certainly Bowen should receive the benefit
but ox course, if the judgment of this Court is that Bowen
Is decided today nationwide, then Bowen should also receive
the benefit of that decision.
But what l am really urging is that Bowen should
receive the benefits of this decision, not only for those
two reasons but also for the reason that Bowen is the
beneficiary of this Court’s first opportunity to review
■■

border checkpoint cases in the light of its past decisions
under Carroll and I think under all three of those focusses
of analysis, Bowen gets the benefit of the decision,
The — once more in the retroactivity analysis, I
think what you are also looking at is reasonable reliance.
Now, the Ninth Circuit made a big point of the fact that the
INS relied upon Ninth Circuit opinions.
I have already pointed that from 1925 to 1946 the
IKS relied on nothing, not statute,

not decision, nothing to

establish these checkpoints.
at
It has also pointed out /page 74 of the brief and I

76
believe It is Brlgnonl — excuse me, the brief in Ortiz, that
the IMS stopped and searched a citizen one month after the
Bowen decision was decided in the Minth Circuit outlawing
that very practice, without a warrant and without probable
cause.

That is at page 7^ of the Ortiz brief.
So certainly they are not relying on the Ninth

Circuit, either for the prior justification before this
statute or for the subsequent justification.

The INS is just

stopping and searching people without authority or certainly
not relying upon the Ninth Circuit.
If it could be argued the IMS stopped SanchesPedrosa, which is the case a month after "Bowen was decided in
the Ninth Circuit, if It is argued thau way, then, of course,
they are waiting for this Court to decide Bowen finally and
that would show that they originally should have looked to the
Carroll decision in making their judgments in drafting the
regulations.
The point Is made in the Amicus brief, your Honor,
that this case should be decided, not on the retroactivity
analysis for another reason, that this Court should control
the applicability of its constitutional decisions and I think
that is a very, very important point because what you are
deterring here by that kind of analysis' :Ls future drafting of
regulations In a haphazard manner.

What you are encouraging

by that kind of analysis is the drafting of regulations

77
carefully and prudently looking at all the law, especially
including the law as announced by this Court.
Had that been done by the persons

and we are

not looking at lav; enforcement. Justice Burger — you noted
"reasonable reliance by law enforcement officers."
That is not all you are deterring in this case.
The only authority for these officers to conduct these
searches was a regulation drafted by their own people at the
INS.
What you are deterring and would be deterring in
the future by a nonretroactivity analysis and deciding
whether retroactivity applies on a case-by-case basis is
careful, prudent drafting of regulations which guides these
lav; enforcement officers and I think that is a practice you
want to encourage and I think a practice you ’want to deter
is haphazard drafting without research or without authority.
Even under the traditional retroactivity analysis,
this case differs from the prior Court's decisions.
This case will not have nationwide application as
\

/

did all of the other cases where nonretroactivity was ordered.
This case deals with the INS, the INS only.
The smallness of that law enforcement agency is
well apparent from the Government’s briefs and from the
Petitioner’s brief in all of these casos.
Nor will it disrupt state, local and federal courts

78
all over the country or law enforcement authorities.
Certainly, this analysis would aid in that conclusion
and aid you to see that this, in the first instance, is not a
retroactivity case because of the prior law of

this Court

and, second, that even if you consider It under the tradi­
tional analysis,

the extent of the reliance is much smaller.

The effect on courts and administration of justice
is much smaller and certainly no one can say that this is
reasonable reliance by the Immigration and Naturalisation
Service on clear past practice.
The cases on retroactivity have, as I see it, fallen
into two categories.

Number one, where you have overruled

cases, like RabAr.owits and Goldman, in one of your retro­
activity cases.
But, number two, where you have ordered law enforce­
ment officers to do something that they have never been
required to do before, such as Miranda.

You have got to give

warnings now Is what you said in certain cases.
And neither of those two cases — those two types of
cases, has anything to do with this situation where, as we
have already pointed out, clear law did not support the
regulations issued by the Justice Department nor did

a

fair

reading of the statutes and. as 1 say, when you talk about law
enforcement in a situation like this, you are talking about
not only the officer in the field but those who are advising

79
him.
