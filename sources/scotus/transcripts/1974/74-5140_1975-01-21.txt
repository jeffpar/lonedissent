MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Cassius against Arizona,, No. 74-5140.
Mr. Klein, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK S. KLEIN ON
BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. KLEIN.
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

This case involves a challenge to the constitutionality

of an Arizona statute, title 13 of the Arizona Revised
Statute, section 1580, which provides, and I quote:

"A person

who is convicted of committing any felony offense, whether
federal or state, which felony offense is committed while such
person is released on bail or his own recognisance

on a

separate felony charge, is guilty of the offense of committing
a felony while released on bail or his own recognisance and
upon coviction of such crime shall be punished by imprisonment
in the state prison for not more than five years,

Such

penalty shall be in addition to and shall be served consecutively
to any penalty imposed for the offense committed while released
on bail or on his own recognizance."
Were a violation of this statute to take place,
three events must occur:

First, a defendant must be charged

with a felony which I would call Charge A

and must be released

on that charge? second, the defendant must subsequently be
charged with another felony, which I would call Charge B, which

is' alleged to have occurred while he was released on Charge A;
and thirdly, the defendant must be convicted of Charge Bo

He

need not be convicted of Charge A, and in fact it doesn't
make any difference what the result on Charge A is as far as
section 1580 is concerned.
In this case, the petitioner, Michael Cassius, was
arrested and charged with burglary of a motor vehicle»

He was

released on that charge and he was subsequently arrested at
the scene of an apparent burglary of a business establishment.
He was charged with the second charge of burglary and also
with the charge of committing a felony while released on
cognizance under section 1580.
On January 4, 1973, a hearing was held in the
Superior Court at which time the defendant pleaded guilty to
the second burlgary charge.

The first burglary charge was

dismissed —
QUESTION;
MR. KLEIN;

Do you know why?
Why it was dismissed?

It was dismissed

as part of an agreement to plead to the second burglary charge.
QUESTION:

Would it be fair to say that the State

had concluded that it was satisfied with one guilty plea that
would have a substantial sentence even though the man had
apparently committed two criminal acts?
MR. KLEIN:
QUESTION:

Well ~
I apply "apparently” with emphasis.

5
MR. KLEIN:

I realize that the fact that it was

disposed of in this way, of course, denies us the opportunity
to look at the substance of the first charge.

But it was

dismissed as pardon plea bargaining.
QUESTION:

The problem is there are three crimes,

aren't there?
MR. KLEIN:

That's correct, your Honor.

And the

charge under Section 1580 was then submitted to the Court
for trial and the defendant was found guilty on that charge.
The defendant was sentenced to a term of one to two years
imprisonment on the burglary charge; he was sentenced to a
consecutive term of one to three years on the Section 1580
charge.
On appeal the Arizona Court of Appeals held that
Section 1580 as applied to this petitioner violated his
rights under the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment.
But the Arizona Supreme Court vacated the Court of Appeals
decision and held that section 1580 neither constituted
double jeopardy nor denied equal protection.
QUESTION:

Mr. Klein, just to go back.

sure it's quite clear in my mind.
MR. KLEIN:
QUESTION:
was dismissed.
burglary charge?

I'm not

There was a plea bargain.

Yes, that's correct.
Under which the first burglary charge

There was, what, a guilty plea to the second

6

MR. KLEIN:
QUESTION:

That's correct, your Honor.
And what did the bargain have to say, if

anytlxing, about the 1580 charge?
MR. KLEIN:

Well, the bargain provided that the

defendant was not going to plead guilty to the 1580 charge and
the trial court was advised that the reason for this was that
the defendant wished to reserve his right to challenge that
statute on appeal.
QUESTION:

Because there was no — what was done

was exactly in accord with the bargain.
MR. KLEIN:
QUESTION:
MR. KLEIN:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
Thank you.
You are welcome.
Mr. Klein, do you know, is this statute

frequently used by the prosecution in Arizona?
MR. KLEIN:
frequently used.

In the experience of our office it is

However, our experience is also that very

often this charge is dismissed as part of plea bargains.

But

I am aware that there are a number of individuals in the
State prison serving sentences under this charge.
We have presented two questions to this Court.

The

first is that section 1580 violates the double jeopardy clause
of the fifth amendment as applied to the States through the
due process clause
QUESTION:

in the 14th amendments.
On this issue, if he had entered a guilty

7
plea to the first charge, then sentenced, and then a guilty
plea to the subsequent charges, would you think that would be
a waiver, or what would be your view?

You have made the

point that you haven’t had a chance to test out, which is
correct, the truth of the first charge except as there is
some tacit admission involved in the so-called bargaining
negotiations.

But if he had been found guilty, had his day

in court on that first one, either by plea or by trial.
MR. KLEIN:

Well, let me turn that question around,

if I may, Mr. Chief Justice.

Part of our argument with

reference to our equal protection claims is that the statute,
because it in a sense presumes the defendant guilty of the
first charge even though it may not be proven contravenes
the presumption of innocence.

And if the statute were drafted

sc to say that the State must prove a conviction of both the
first and the second charge, it would saern to me that there
would be no infringement upon the presumption of innocence.
But I'm not sure •— the statute as drafted does not
require a conviction of the first charge, and this defendant
was in fact not convicted of the first charge.
Does that answer your question?
QUESTION:

In some places.

QUESTION:

What element does the State have to

prove, Mr. Klein, in 1530?
MR. KLEIN:

That's a good question, your Honor.

Neither of the Arizona courts which wrote an opinion in this
case indicated what the elements of the 1580 charge were.

In

fact, the Arizona Supreme Court said that the charges of which
tills defendant was convicted, burglary and 1580, had no
elements in common»
Now, the State in its petition, in its brief, has
argued that there are two elements»

They say that, first of

all, there is an element of conviction of a felony, and
secondly, that there is an element of commission while the
defendant is released on a felony charge»

And I submit that

that statement is also ambiguous in terms of determining what
the elements are.
QUESTION:

What was the proof in the trial of this

1580 charge, Mr. Klein?
MR. KLEIN:

The proof was that the court was asked

to take judicial notice of the fact that burglary wat a felony,
that the defendant had entered a plea of guilty to burglary,
and it was stipulated that the defendant had been charged
previously and had been released on that charge and had
remained released during the period of time in which the
second burglary charge was alleged to have occurred.

And the

only reason there was need for that stipulation was that the
justice of the peace who released the defendant had not issued
an order, entered one into the record, and so the court
couldn't take judicial notice of that.

9

QUESTION:

Do you regard your client as having bean

free and at large by virtue of a constitutional right or by
virtue of a statutory provision?
MR. KLEIN:

We regard him having been at large

by virtue of a State constitutional right which also receives
Federal constitutional protection, although I submit that
it’s unclear what the parameters of that protection are.

This

Court has said, for example, that the presumption of innocence
would be meaningless if defendants could not be released
prior to their trial, because if they could not, they would
be punished before they were tried.
QUESTION:

Of course, we would all agree that the

Federal Constitution doesn't guarantee the right to be
released on bail, but merely that they may not be required to
furnish excessive bail.
MR. KLEIN:

Is that not correct?

Well, that's certainly what the eighth

amendment protection provides, your Honor.

I would submit,

though, that the fact that a right to release is not absolute,
does not make it any less fundamental.

Even the right to

free speech, which is one of the most nearly absolute rights,
is not absolute.

You can't yell, "Firein a crowded theater

QUESTION:
questions.

Mr. Klein, we keep peppering you with

I think I understand your double jeopardy approach

Suppose Arizona, however, instead of having this statute
which seems to rae to be a fairly unusual one, provided that

10

the punishment for burglary shall be X years, but the punishment
for burglary committed while on an RPR after one being charged
for a felony, is Y years, Y being greater than X»

Anything

unconstitutional about that, drawing a distinction in punish­
ment as distinguished from making it a separate crime?
MR. KLEIN;

If I understand your question, it is,

if the statute had been drafted as a punishment enhancement
statute rather than as a separate crime, would this violate the
double jeopardy clause, and my answer would be no, although
there might still be some problems under our equal protection
argument.
QUESTION;

And yet the same result would be

accomplished as the State claims is accomplished here.
MR. KLEIN;

Not exactly.

Well, the same result

the State seeks would be accomplished, but the effects upon
the defendant would be different.

For example, because it is

charged as a separate offense, the defendant is subject to
recidivous penalties, that is, for his one criminal act, it
goes down on the record as two offenses committed one after
the other, and he is not entitled to the advantageous good
time credits that he would be entitled to were he a first
offender.

Ills parole eligibility date is -QUESTION:

But the State legislatively could attach

all those consequences to a single crime of committing
burglary while on bail just like it attaches a higher penalty.

perhaps.
. MR. KLEIN:
Honor.

There are additional consequences, your

The fact that it is a separate offense and not a

punishment enhancement statute gives the prosecutor opportunities
which the double jeopardy clause was designed to prevent.
For example, there is no need to prosecute 1580 at the same
time as the first felony offense.
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but that argument would

go to cases where any one act is broken up into several crimes
and they are all prosecuted at once.
MR. KLEIN:

But the difference is that -— our

argument is that this is the same offense, and what I ara
saying is that a punishment enhancement statute, wh^lc. it
would serve the same objectives that the State claims to have t j ^
would not have precisely the same consequences on the
defendant,a

punishment enhancement statute would not.

QUESTION;

But it would solve the double jeopardy

argument, wouldn't it?
MR. KLEIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, it would, your Honor.
But you think you would still have an

arguable equal protection claim.
MR. KLEIN:

Well, I think that a punishment

enhancement statute could be drafted so as not to come within
the equal protection arguments that we raise.

For example,

as I say, the infringement upon the presumption of innocence

12

could be done away with by requiring a conviction on the
first as well as the second offense»

I think that a punishment

enhancement provision could be drafted to serve the same
objectives without violating either of the guarantees that we
argue were violated in this case.
QUESTION;

Mr. Klein,, do you think Blockburger is

consistent with your double jeopardy argument?
MR. KLEIN:

Yes, your Honor, I do.

The Court has

devised a number of tests for determining whether two offenses
are the same, and the Blockburger test is probably the
narrowest or the most restrictive of these tests»

But I

believe that our case meets that test as well.
QUESTION;

Was Blockburger said to rest by the Court

on double jeopardy?
MR. KLEIN:
QUESTION:

My recollation is that it was, your Honor
You think that Justice Sutherland relied

on the double jeopardy clause in Blockburger?

You didn't even

mention it so far as I know.
MR. KLEIN;

Then I stand corrected, your Honor.

I

do know that in subsequent cases Blockburger has been relied
upon as a test for double jeopardy.
QUESTION:

Let me ask you one more question about

what I guess are basically the facts.

In the proceedings

before Judge Marks resolving doubts of facts and so forth in
favor of the prevailing party, as we do here, can it fairly

13
be said that Judge Marks found that your client had committed
the second burglary?
MR» KLEIN;

Nell, the defendant pleaded guilty to the

second burglary.
QUESTION;
MR. KLEIN;
QUESTION;

He pleaded guilty to the second burglary.
That's correct, your Honor.
Were there any contested issues of fact

tried before the trial judge?
MR. KLEIN:

No.

And one of our objections to the

way 1580 is drafted is that it really only requires a determina­
tion whether a defendant falls within a particular class
defined by the statute.
QUESTION;

So the only factual element of the crime,

at least the second burglary element, was the commission of
the crime while on bail.
MR. KLEIN;

Your client pleaded guilty.

Pleaded guilty to the second burglary,

that's correct, your Honor.
QUESTION:

And it was conceded that he did if while

on bail?
MR. KLEIN:
QUESTION:

That's correct, your Honor.
There really weren't any factual issues

in dispute in the 1580 proceeding?
MR. KLEIN:
QUESTION:
guilty plea

I would say that's correct.
But you reserved this issue on your

MS. KLEIN:

Yes, your Honor.

Yes, because — and it

was obvious in the context that the defendant’s counsel believed
that the statute itself was subject to challenge.
QUESTION:

Some State supreme courts and perhaps some

courts of appeals have held there is no constitutional problem
about defining certain crimes as more serious and subject to
greater punishment when they are committed, for example,
within a prison, an assault on a prison guard, an assault on
a fellow prisoner, killing of a prison guard.
You, I take it, concede that a statute could be
drawn which would impose the greater punishment for the
commission of a crime while on bail without regard to whether
that issue of fact on the first crime for which he was bailed
was ever

tried out.

The question may be a little confusing.

Z4R. KLEIN:

I'm not sure I quits understand the

QUESTION:

You concede that a greater punishment

question.

could be imposed constitutionally for committing a crime while
on bail, without regard to whether or not there is ever a
trial in that first charge.
MR. KLEIN:

In terms of our double jeopardy argument,

yes, we do concede that.

But that v/ould be different from

providing for a subsequent prosecution for that crime.
QUESTION:
your two trials.

Mr. Klein, I still have trouble finding

There is only one trial.

15
MR. KLEIN:

Well# it's my understanding, your

Honor, that the protection of the double jeopardy clause
which derives from the common law plea of former conviction
does not require two trials»

It requires a trial following

a conviction, and that conviction may be on a guilty plea..
In this case there was a guilty plea entered, and
then the defendant was tried, that is,as much as you can
have a trial under 1530, on the 1580 charge»
QUESTION:
MR» KLEIN:

Was it a trial?
Well, I think that depends upon whether

you interpret the statute as indicating separate elements
or whether you consider it a bill of attainder»
QUESTION:

You mentioned a minute ago all the

difficulties in this as contrasted to an enhanced sentence.
I don’t see but one, and that is he has two convictions»

I

don't see anything else.
MR. KLEIN:

Well, in terms of the fact that the

prosecutor has discretion whether or not to charge 1580 and
when to charge it.
QUESTION:
MR. KLEIN:

If the prosecutor, for example —
The results after it is done.
Well, the double jeopardy clause is

designed to protect certain interests.
QUESTION:
now.

One of those interests ---

I'm not talking about double jeopardy

I’m talking about the difference between being convicted

and getting five years because you did it while you were a felon

16

as contrasted to two and a half years if you did it without
being out on bail.

And you gave a whole lot, and

don't

see but one, and that is you get. two convictions.

That's

the only —
MR. KLEIN;

Well, you have two convictions and the

fact that you have two convictions gives rise to a number of
collateral consequences.
QUESTION;
HR. KLEIN:
QUESTION:

Which the legislature could have stopped.
But in addition —•
Does the legislature say if you commit a

felony while out on bail, you shall not be eligible for parole
ever?
MR. KLEIN:

That's an issue I would rather not

address myself to, because we have some cases like that at the
present time.
QUESTION:

I mean the sentencing is within the power

of the State legislature.
MR. KLEIN:
QUESTION:

Within certain limits, surely.
One limit, parole

..

Do you

know another one?
MR. KLEIN:

Well, there are limitations placed upon

it by the due process clause, certainly.
QUESTION:
MR, KLEIN:
QUESTION:

About the length of a sentence?
On the matter of imposition of sentence.
We are off on the wild blue yonder now.

But I have great difficulty with the legislature taking one
of two choices.
only had one.

I guess you say they didn’t have two, they
They could enhance it.

There is no problem

about that.
HR. KLEIN:
QUESTION:

Under the double jeopardy clause.
There is no problem about that.

And

that the only problem here is that instead of that you get
another "trial" on the same thing.
HR. KLEIN:

That’s it.

Yes, but, in that, your Honor, for

example, if the prosecutor were dissatisfied with the sentence
that Mr. Cassius received on his burglary plea and supposing
that he had not at that time chosen to prosecute under 1530.
He could then prosecute under 1530 in order to bring the
punishment more into line with his viextf.

Now, that's analogou

with the protection double jeopardy provides in cases of
former acquittal where v;e say a prosecutor shall not be
allowed to increase his chances of obtaining the conviction
by reprosecuting for the same offense.

Here he is trying to

increase his chances of getting the sentence he believes to
be appropriate by being allowed to reprosecute following the
conviction.
QUESTION:

I see.

QUESTION:

Mr. Klein, I suppose the only additional

element under your statutory crime is being out on bail or
on an R.P.R.

That in itself isn’t criminal, is it?

18
MR» KLEIN:

Not to ray knowledge; your Honor.

out on bail is not a crime-

To be

I'm not sure I understand your

question., though.
QUESTION:

Nell, there may be no sense in it, but

I guess what I am asking is whether the difference between
burglary and the offense under the special statute is only
an element which in itself is not criminal.
MR. KLEIN:

That would be my interpretation of it,

your Honor, that it is an element, if you can call it that,
which is not what we have traditionally regarded as an element
of criminal responsibility.
QUESTION:

And yet the legislature here has made

it an element of criminal responsibility.
MR. KLEIN:

Well, at least that is, as I read it,

the Arizona Supreme Court’s interpretation of that statute.
QUESTION:

You are subject to kind of additional

constraints while on bail, don't commit any crimes, efc cetera,
that the ordinary person is not subject to in the sense of a
judicial injunction.
MR. KLEIN:

I would agree that you are under

additional constraints, but I would not agree that the duty
to obey the law is an additional constraint.

That's the same

duty whether you are released on a charge or not.

Everyone

has that same duty.
QUESTION:

Except your bail can be revoked if you

19

don’t obey the law when you are on bail.

And an ordinary

citizen if he doesn't obey the law has to go through a full
criminal proceeding before his liberty can be restrained.
MR. KLEIN:

Well, in the sense that the conditions

of his bail can be established in the same way. I'ra not sure
that I would quite agree.

But the reason that a condition of

good behavior is put into bail agreements is precisely so that
the court, if it has reason to believe that an individual has
not been behaving himself while released so that he can
re-examine the conditions of his release.
QUESTION:

And to that extent he is in a different

spot than the person who has never been arraigned in the first
place.
MR. KLEIN:

In a different position, but not with

regard with his duty to obey the law.

He has the same duty.

QUESTION:

But different consequences attach to a

MR. KLEIN:

Well, a person who commits a crime is

breach.

subject to loss of his liberty.

That's true whether you are

released or not.
QUESTION:

Mr. Klein, in a case like this, does the

man have his bail revoked, too?
MR. KLEIN:
your Honor.
of bail

Section 1580 does not provide for that,

There are provisions in Arizona law for revocation

20

QUESTION:

It's not in this case, but do they have

a statute on a parolee committing a felony?
MR. KLEIN;
QUESTION?

Not to my knowledge, your Honor.
Just curious.

MR. KLEIN;

If I may, I think I would like to reserve

the remainder of my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Klein.

You

may, surely.
Mr. Schafer.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. SCHAFER, III.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. SCHAFER:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I am William Schafer, Assistant Attorney General

for the State of Arizona, and I represent respondents.
Before I begin the discussion of the merits,, I think
I should answer one question that was raised during Mr. Klein's
argument, because it did occur to me and I did attempt to
do some research to find out the extent of it.

The question

was asked if section 1530 is frequently used.
My research has indicated that section 1580 is not
frequently used except for one county in the State ox Arizcsia,
and that is Mr. Klein's county, Pima County.

And there I have

been very reliably informed that it is used almost every time
that it is available.

I believe there is some kind of an

unwritten policy that it will be used whenever it does apply in

21
a particular case»
The other counties, however, do not use it on any
kind of a regular basis whatsoever.
QUESTION:

Is Pima County regularly the way it was

here, to make two separate offenses, and in this case with
consecutive sentences?

Or is it just used to make one

conviction on an aggravated offense?
HR. SCHAFER:

Your Honor, I believe in Maricopa

County it is not used on any regular basis whatsoever,
was a difficult time trying to find that out,
is only used once or twice really»

It

I believe it

And that does lead into

another question, I suppose, that has not been asked directly,
but has been indirectly, and that is:
of an ordinary plea bargain?

Is this used as part

Now, my experience has also told

me in my attempt to find out here that is not the case.
However, I could be corrected.

There was a plea bargain here.

Obviously, from the reading of the transcript in this case
from the very beginning it appeared as though there was some
kind of a plea bargain struck, and conceivably there could be
more to the plea bargain than what v/e can piece together here
because at the very end we also find out that Mr. Cassius did
work with the police and in his estimation cleared up 15
burglary cases, I believe.

So conceivably there was more to

the plea bargain.
But in direct answer to your question, and perhaps a

22

little of my own there, I do not believe that wherever this
statute has been used it has been, used as something to plea
bargain to or down from.
Other than Maricopa and Pima, I have not been able
to find, I believe, any instance of where this statute has been
used.
QUESTION;

Arizona is a State, isn't it, where the

county attorney of the individual county has the primary
discretion to determine prosecution policy?
MR. SCIIAFER:

Yes, it is, your Honor.

I have to smile

at that because we just argued that issue before the Arizona
Supreme Court last week.

Unfortunately, the Arizona Supreme

Court refused to take that issue, but by refusing to do it,
they indicate, yes, he has almost the sole responsibility
within the county.
QUESTION:

How many counties?

MR. SCHAFER:
QUESTION:

Thirteen, your Honor.

At least you don't have 80 or 90

different prosecution policies as some States do, then.
MR. SCHAFER:

No, we do not.

And if you go beyond

Maricopa and Pima, the occasions for using such a statute
probably arise very seldom.
It seems odd that from the very beginning almost,the
petitioner and respondent, myself, here have really been
arguing essentially the same test and perhaps the same case or

at 3-east based upon the same case since we started.

Apparently

we both read that case# we both read the test# and we come
out really with a different result.

And the test and the case

I refer to are the same evidence test which is called by
various other names, but that’s the one that typifies it best
to me, and the Blockburger case.
There was a question earlier whether the fifth
amendment was the ground upon which Blockburger rested, and
I could have answered that question by saying I do not recall
the fifth amendment being mentioned in that case.
QUESTION:

However —

Wot even anything else, not even the

word "Constitution" appears.
MR. SCHAFER;

I can’t say that, your Honor, but I

do remember, I think the second or third time reading it, that
I suddenly found that the fifth amendment itfas not in that case.
However, there is a later case which I cite in
the brief, Gore, which does go back to Blockburger, and it
does have, next to the last page, a reference in the majority
opinion that if this were not the rule or if this rule were
to be changed, then all sorts of cases would also have to be
changed, and the contention was specifically raised there
whether this was in violation of the fifth amendment.
We both do start out with the Blockburger test.
We both rely on that same evidence test.

X think we begin to

diverge, however, on something that came up very early here

24

this afternoon» and that is as to whether that test really
pertains to the actual evidence that was introduced to prove
two violations, or whether what the court was concerned with
in Blockburger and all the cases after that was as to the
elements of the particular charges and not necessarily the
actual proof that was put in at the trial.
Wow, our contention is that which either of those
two avenues is selected here, both have been satisfied in
this case under the same evidence test.

It is difficult hare,

of course, because of the guilty plea to go back and determine
actual proof.

We cannot really do that.

QUESTION:

If you would agree, perhaps

your

friend might even agree, that if there has been a guilty plea
to both burglaries, but with an agreement that contemplated
the aggregate punishment the same as was actually entered
here, that that would eliminate a good deal of his argument.
MR. SCHAFER:
Yes.

The double jeopardy argument on it?

And that gets back, I9m sure, to the enhanced punishment.
QUESTION:

And the presumption of innocence argument

which he separated from his double jeopardy.
QUESTION:
under 1580.

Well, you would still have the conviction

That9s the problem here.

MR. SCHAFER:

I was going to say if you mean the

two burglary convictions, I separate the first burglary
conviction.

I will discuss and the discussion in the brief

25

really concerns only — and I hate to call it this, but it's
fcne second burglary and the 1580.

And I believe we can

really separate out that first burglary conviction.

And if

the question pertains to enhanced punishment, I think we can
refer to the second burglary and the 1580,and in a sense
the legislature could draft a statute.
QUESTION:

I thought the first burglary charge was

dismissed, there was no conviction.
MR. SCIIAFER:

No, your Honor.

I am prefacing my

remarks to show I thought the question involved a guilty plea.
QUESTION:

I'm sorry.

first burglary conviction.

I thought you referred to the

There is only one burglary

conviction here.
MR. SCHAFER:
and second.

That's why I hate to call it first

Yes, the initial burglary that started this

entire case.
QUESTION:

They dismissed that one.

MR. SCHAFER:

Right.

And that eventually was

eliminated entirely.
As I say, we contend —
QUESTION:

There was a second burglary conviction

in that he was convicted of burglary while on bail on a
felony charge.
MR. SCHAFER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

That is true, your Honor.

There were two burglary

convictions,

26

one on a guilty plea and one on the judge's finding on agreed
facts.
MR. SCHAFER:
QUESTION:

No, your Honor.

Is that right?

MR. SCHAFER:

No.

Mr. Cassius was initially charged

with burglary, and he was released O.R.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. SCHAFER:

Approximately a month and a half after

that occurred, he was then caught in a building and was
charged with another burglary.
QUESTION;

Right.

MR. SCHAFER:

And at the same time he was charged

with what I will call 1530.
QUESTION:

And that was for committing a burglary

while he was on bail on a felony charge.
MR. SCHAFER:

Yes, committing a burglary on which

he was found caught in a building.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. SCHAFER:
QUESTION;
burglary?

Now, when we get to the plea bargaining

Can he also be charged with the first

Had there been three?
MR. SCIIAFER;
QUESTION:

He had been charged with the first one,

Could he have been convicted?

MR. SCHAFER: He could have been, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Then he could have had three convictions.

27
HR. SCHAFER:
QUESTION:

He could have.

But whether or not he was convicted on

the first charge from which he was released on his t.k. has
nothing to do with the issues in this case.
MR. SCHAFER:

That is why I was prefacing my remarks

to Mr. Chief Justice that I separate that entirely, and I have
attempted assiduously to avoid referring to that in the brief
because I think it makes it confusing, and I don’t think it
has anything really to do with the issues here.
What I am talking about is that second burglary and
the 1500.

And when I talk about the Blockburger test and the

same evidence test, I am talking about those two particular
offenses.

And I would choose to talk in this case, and I think

this is justified by the case law from this Court, as to the
elements that are involved in those crimes in whether after
considering those elements v/e can truthfully say that those
two particular offenses require proof of different elements,
therefore, they are two offenses and there may be two
punishments.
Nov;, Mr. Klein has said and said in his reply brief
which I got shortly before I came here that there are no cases
and nowhere in the State of Arizona is there anything that
v/ill tell us what the elements of a 1580 crime are.
That’s not quite right.

There is a statement, and I

believe they lay it out in the Court of Appeals9 opinion, the

23

Arizona Court of Appeals, what one element is and what the
other element is of a 1580 violation»

There are no other cases

on 1530 in the State of Arizona that either of us have been
able to find, I believe»
However, the Court of Appeals5 opinion does sav that
the elements of that crime are conviction of a felony and that
felony being committed while a person was on bail or G.R.

And

I believe over and above whether there are any cases delineating
what those elements are, the statute itself is quite clear as
to what the elements are that are required to be proved when
a prosecutor goes to court»

And I don’t think there is any

doubt when you read that statute that

says there has to be

a conviction.
The petitioner would say that that is not an element
but that is simply a standard of proof that has been inserted
into the statute by the legislature, but there is no indication
of that whatsoever other than perhaps someone believing that.
It is, we contend, an element of proof in that statute.
QUESTIONS

Then I take it you are arguing that these

are separate and distinct crimes,
MR, SCHAFER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And that this is not an enhancement of

punishment statute,
MR. SCHAFER:

Yes, we are, your Honor.

And I draw

an analogy to enhancement of punishment statutes in the brief.

29
But I have to admit and concede that this creates a separate
offense, whereas the enhancement of punishment statute would
not.

And along with my analogy of the wording of the statement

and the elements that are contained within the wording itself,
I don't believe I can conscientiously say that this does not
create a separate offense.

It seems to, and it seems quite

clear that the Arizona legislature meant to create a separate
offense if we go upon the wording of the statute.
QUESTION:

Well, is it separate or two.

MR. SCHAFER:
QUESTION:

Well, separate from the

The second, at least looking at page 4,

the criminal complaint, on the first count he committed a
burglary, he was convicted and sentenced on that.

The second

one is he also committed a burglary and was sentenced on that,
the same burglary.
MR. SCHAFER:

Excuse me.

Are you on page 4 of the

petition?
QUESTION:

Page 4 of the appendix.

MR. SCHAFER:
QUESTION:

Oh, the appendix.

The charge.

It's phrased at least, the

second count is he committed a burglary while on bond.

And

the first one is he committed a burglary, and it's the same
burglary referred to in both.
MR. SCHAFER;
QUESTION:

It is, yes.

So he's convicted twice for the same

burglary.
MR. SCHAFER:

Well, that's the petitioner's contention

your Honor.
QUESTION:

No, no; as phrased, the way the charge

reads.
MR. SCHAFER:

I was going to say our ansx*er to that

is that the phrasing of the charge really does not indicate
the separateness of those two offenses.
QUESTION:

In fact, it's quite bad pleading, isn't

it, because if you look at the language of the statute on
page 3 of the petitioner's brief, the offense doesn't occur
until after the conviction on the first burglary.
MR. SCHAFER:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

So they can't really be charged that way

because, I mean, if you think about accurate and artistic
pleading —
MR. SCHAFER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

—• there is no

offense under 1580

until there is a conviction of the felony.
MR. SCHAFER:
QUESTION:

Is that right?

That's what we argue.

And that's what the statute says very

clearly on page 3 of the petitioner's brief.

So this indictment

or this complaint, rather, couldn't be right because they
couldn't charge him under count two until he had been convicted
under count one, if you take the statute’s literal words to mean

31

what they say.
MR. SCHAFER:
QUESTION:

That5s correct, your Honor.

Mr. Schafer, when the Supreme Court of

Arizona vacated the court of appeals'1 opinion, did it indicate
any doubt as to the construction that had been placed on the
statutory language by the court of appeals?
MR. SCHAFER:

No, it did not, your Honor, and there

is no indication in the Supreme Court opinion itself as to what
it thought those elements would be.
Reading the opinion, however, I assume we can ~
or I could at least read it and get from it the same two
elements that the court of appeals did.

Bu.t, no, I would have

to say there is no indication.
QUESTION:

This isn’t a separate crime; this is an

additional crime, isn't it?
MR. SCHAFER:

Well, I might say it is an additional

crime, your Honor.
QUESTION:

But it's not enhancement.

MR. SCHAFER:
QUESTION:

No, it is not enhancement.

Now I am in trouble.

It’s an additional

crime but it's not enhancement.
MR. SCHAFER:

When I use the word "'enhancement”

as I think it has been used here so far this afternoon, that
really gets back to the ordinary enhancement statute.
QUESTION:

Well, the difference between enhancement

32

and this

is if these two sentences would run concurrently,,

nobody would be here.

The fact they are here is because the

two sentences are consecutive, that's why we are here,
MR. SCHAFER:

I would assume that that has a great

deal of validity to it, your Honor, yes.
QUESTION:

And indeed there would have to be, according

to this statute.
MR. SCHAFER:
QUESTION:

Yes, it"s required in the statute.

That doesn't give you any difficulty.

MR. SCHAFER:

No, it doesn't give me any difficulty.

In fact, I use that to verify my belief in my arguments that
what the legislature really had in mind was to make two
offenses out of this.

And I can call them separate, I can

call them distinct, but it's two offenses.

And that's why I

say I really cannot say that to me this is an enhancement of
punishment statute, because that's not what an enhancement of
punishment statute is.
QUESTION:

I don't know what it means in this case,

but it seems to me that I still don't understand why a man is
so bad and vicious that you have to give him two sentences and
he ends up with five years altogether for burglary.

He could

have given him five on the one, couldn't he?
MR. SCHAFER:

He could have received up to 15 on the

burglary and up to five on the 1580 charge.
QUESTION:

Why would —- if the same judge is going

33

to give him a certain number of years, why did he have to
split it up;and then give him less?
MR. SCHAFER:

The simple answer there would be that

the statute simply requires it.

There are no two ways about

that under the wording of the statute, it does require it to
\

be consecutive.
How, there is something interesting there, however,
in the transcript of the sentencing before Judge Harks.

One

of the arguments that is made by Mr. Cassius' attorney is
that the judge take that into consideration that it has to be
consecutive sentences.

And, of course, it was known by

everyone that it could have been up to 15 on the burglary and
five on the 1580.

There is no indication by Judge Marks that

he actually did take that into consideration in the sentence
he gave.

The only thing he does indicate that he took into

consideration was Mr. Cassius» willingness to work with the
police.

But that is a possibility that that could be taken

into consideration and might well in a number of cases by the
trial judge.
QUESTION:

He imposed a very small proportion of the

allowable penalty, did he not?
MR. SCHAFER:

Well, yes.

X don't want to say that

because I know nothing about this case, but it seems that way.
QUESTION:

The maximum penalty was what, altogether?

km. SCHAFER:

Twenty.

34

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. SCHAFER:

And what did he impose?

One to two and one to three, and the

one to three was consecutive.
QUESTION:

So he has got a two-year minimum as

against a possible 20-year maximum.
MR. SCHAFER:

On the surface, at least, it would

seem, y<ic, that that is quite obviously compared to w'aat he
could have done at the time.

He unfortunately does not go

any further in the transcript.
QUESTION:

Well, do judges in Arizona ordinarily

give soma explanations about their sentencing process?
MR. SCHAFER:
ordinarily do not.

I think I can answer that that no, they

However, every once in a while you will

run into one who will in this sense.

And here I expected

something because Judge Marks did go further and say about
the boy’s working with the police.
QUESTION:
> Vy

The implication I drew from that when I

:

saw that reference was that this is precisely a mitigating
factor in his imposition of a sentence.

He complied with

tiie statute which required a separate penalty for each one.
I take it he would have had the power to suspend one of the
sentences, would he, under Arizona law?
MR, SCHAFER:

Oh, yes.

1 also have to say that that conclusion popped into
my mind, but I thought about it later and' perhaps thought that

35
might have been due to what Mr. Cassius' attorney had said at
the time.

But there is just no indication that that's actually

what happened.
QUESTION:

It's easier for one of us up here to

attribute thought processes to State court judges than it is
for you when you have to continue working with them.
MR. SCHAFER:

I am sure it is.

There is besides the same evidence test that we have
both discussed, there is another test that is referred to in
all the pleadings in this case, and that's the same transaction
test, and it has been mentioned here, at least inferentially,
a couple of times this afternoon.
In the brief, and I think this is borne out by a
whole host of cases, none of which I can put my finger 021
directly, but the same transaction test has generally, we
contend, been used in those situations, not of double punishment,
but of successive trials.

That is not the situation we have

here, although it does get fuzzy at times again because we
are concerned with a plea as well as with what went on later.
The same transaction test, however, although confused
in many cases, confused in the sense that I'm not sure exactly
what they were going for, does appear to apply only in those
situations where there is more than one trial, and that is not
the situation we have here.
the same time.

We have everything done here at

It's conceivable that we could cut hairs and

36

say that the plea and then the subsequent trial to the court
in a sense was another trial.
QUESTION:

It was, but not —

But on your idea that these are different

offenses, the State could try the burglary first and the
burglary while out on bail later.
MR. SCHAFER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And the same transaction test would say no.

MR. SCHAFER:

That generally is true and that's

one of the reasons why I mentioned the same transaction test.
QUESTION:

But there are some cases in the Court,

including perhaps Blockburger, or Gore, that would say that
even if they were the same offenses, the fact that you are
imposing two punishments doss not violate the double jeopardy
clause.
MR. SCHAFER:

I believe what your Honor is alluding

to are --QUESTION:

Well, assume a single act violates three

different statutes.
MR. SCHAFER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And you impose punishments — you try them

all the same time and punish,

impose three punishments for

the identical act.
MR. SCHAFER:

Yes.

That is just about Gore.

And in

the Gore case there were actually six separate violations.
QUESTION:

You have a single sale of narcotics.

37
MR. SCHAFER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

But that violates three, four, or five

statutes.
MR. SCHAFER:

Yes.

QUESTION:

You have separate counts for the violation

under each statute.

You try them all together, he is convicted

on them all.

You can impose consecutive sentences.

MR, SCHAFER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

That’s what Blockburger was.

And I

gather your argument here really is that it5s a single burglary
but it violated two statutes, disposed of them in the same
proceeding, therefore no double jeopardy arises.
MR. SCHAFER:

Essentially, except I would add one

more thing perhaps to that.
single burglary.

I would not quite say just a

There was a burglary which was the triggering

mechanism for the second charge which was —
QUESTION:

In that respect I don’t understand this

at all, if we are going to take the statute as it’s read.
You can’t have an offense under 1580 until and after there is
a conviction on the first burglary.
MR. SCHAFER:
QUESTION:

Is that correct?

Correct.

You can't try them all together.

If

you look at page 3 of the petitioner’s brief and see what that
statute says, it says a person who is convicted of committing
any felony offense while released on bail.

So how could you

30

have a violation of this 1580 until and unless there were a
conviction?
MR. SCHAFER:

I agree, your Honor, that is the wording

of the statute.
QUESTION:

Well, doesn't it mean what it says?

QUESTION;

Couldn’t a conviction occur at a trial

for the offense?
MR. SCHAFER:
QUESTION:

That is essentially what happened here.

Suppose this had gone to trial.

Couldn't

a jury have been charged, "If you find him guilty of the
burglary, then you also may find him guilty of the violation
of 1580."
MR. SCHAFER:

Yes, that's a possibility.

The other

possibility would be that they would do what is analogous to
enhanced punishment, at least in Arizona, try the one charge
and then turn around and do the other one at the same time.
It's deceiving to say at the same time, but it would be in the
same afternoon.
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. SCIIAFER:

That is the warding of the statute.

QUESTION:

At the same trial.

QUESTION:

But they can't reach count two, or the

second question under 1580 unless and until they have
crossed the bridge on count one, that is, did he perform the
act of the burglary.

39

MR. SCHAFER;
QUESTION;

Was he convicted of the burglary.

They found that he did the act, which is

conviction. A component of the offense is a conviction, is it
not?
MR. SCHAFER;
QUESTION;

Yes.

But you draw no distinction between the

result of a plea of guilty and any other type conviction, do
you?
MR, SCHAFER;
QUESTION;

No, I do not, your Honor.

I thought Justice Stewart's inquiry of

you was that you can't even indict for a 1580 until you have
a first conviction.
QUESTION:

I take it you can under Arizona practice.
They did in this case.

MR. SCHAFER:

They did in this case, and that has

never been challenged yet, within my knowledge, neither in the
Arizona Supreme Court or in any other court that I am aware of.
I do know, as I started out by saying, that they do this in
that one particular county consistently.

And Mr.

Klein can

correct me, but I am pretty sure that they do it this way
consistently in Pima County.
QUESTION:

They can't read very well down there.

MR. SCHAFER:
we will close.

If there are no further questions,

Thank you.

MR. SCHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Schafer.

You have a minute or two more if you have anything

40

further, Mr. Klein.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK S. KLEIN ON
BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. KLEIN:

Very briefly, your Honor.

The statement to which Mr. Schafer was referring in
the court of appeals' opinion, or statements, would appear
on pages 34 and 35 of the appendix.

And I think that it would

be difficult to read this statement as in accord with the
decision of the Arizona Supreme Court.

The statement in the

court of appeals' opinion is that the State argues that the
elements of 1580 are different, i.e., one, conviction of a
felony, and, two, such felony having been committed during
a designated period.
QUESTION:

What page are you reading from.

MR. KLEIN:

Page 35 of the appendix.

We find such arguments specious.

The conviction

element is a judicial act, leaving only the burglary as the
act of appellant.

And the Arizona Supreme Court, while not

stating what the elements of 1580 were,said that there were
no elements in common between burglary and 1580.
Now, I think there is a point of agreement between
counsel in that the statute requires proof of a conviction
before one can be found guilty of 1580.

Our contention is

that that is a requisite form of proof of the element of
commission.

QUESTION:

Mr. Klein» is it a fact that under this

very charge, had this first count gone to the jury, could the
trial judge have instructed the jury, "You must find him guilty
first of the burglary before you address the second count.
If you find him guilty of the burglary, you may then address
the second count and find him guilty of that.
MR. KLEIN:

I don’t believe so, your Honor, because

if the jury had called the defendant guilty, it would still
be within the court’s power to overturn that verdict and
therefore it would not be a conviction.
QUESTION:

Well,

a jury verdict of guilty is not

an ultimate conviction, a lot car happen between that verdict
and a judicial conviction.
MR. KLEIN:
QUESTION:

That is my feeling.
The Arizona Court of Appeals is clearly

in accord with Justice Brennan's —
MR. KLEIN:

I don’t believe they are, your Honor.

I believe that they would be in accord with ray viewpoint that
a conviction must be proven, but that the element involved —
that eom/iction is merely a form of proof of commission.
If there are no further questions, I thank your
Honors.
MR. CIIXEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Klein.

You appeared here at our request by appointment of this Court.
We thank you for your assistance to the Court and, of course,

12

your assistance to your own client.
Thank you. Mr. Attorney General.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 2:45 p.m., oral arguments in the
above-entitled matter were concluded.)
