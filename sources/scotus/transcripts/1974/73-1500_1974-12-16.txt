MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We'll hear arguments

in 73-1500, Erickson against Feather.
Mr. Day, I think you may proceed whenever you're
ready with this one.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM F. DAY, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DAY;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
Your Honors, this case involves the same alleged
reservation, only this case originated out of the Eighth
Circuit Court of Appeals on a writ of habeas corpus, and
this is a petition for writ of certiorari to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.
These ten Indian gentleman — I believe there are
ten of them in here — were all confined, and convicted in
the South Dakota Penitentiary for offenses for which they
had been convicted within the original boundaries of the
Sisseton-Wahpeton, former Indian Reservation.
QUESTION; These ware for various offenses —
MR. DAY;

Various offenses.

QUESTION;

And all on —

MR. DAY;

All on —

QUESTION;
MR. DAY;

AH took place on non-allotted land?
All on fee land.

4
QUESTIONS
MR» DAY;

On fee land»
Fee simple land, non-allotted land, yes,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

And I guess none of these offenses

was -- that would just complicata it further -- was under that
Ten —
MR. DAY:
QUESTION;

Ten Major Crimes Act.
— Major Crimes Act of the federal

legislation?
MR. DAY;

The Ten Major Crimes do not apply when

we8re not in Indian country.
QUESTION;

Well, I know, but if you were, this —

MR, DAY;

It would.

Yes, it would apply, but it

didn’t —
QUESTION;

Well, these — none of these crimes may

have been within the — within that list of ten.
MR. DAY;
QUESTION;

Do you know?

Right.
Do you know whether they were?

MR. DAY;

Oh.

QUESTION;

Those are the serious criminal offenses.

MR, DAY;

None of these --

None of these — well, I think maybe —

I don91 know.
QUESTION:
MR. DAY;
QUESTION:

All right.
I don’t know that.
But your point is that it doesn’t make any

5
difference to the central issue, is that it?
MR. DAY:

No, sir, not if the State of South Dakota

has jurisdiction.
The law or the case law that really developed on
the Sisseton-Wahpeton Indian Reservation were four PsMarrias
Indian cases.

Two of their* were in the Supreme Court of —

I believe the Supreme Court of South Dakota, and the second
one of those cases, this Court denied, certiorari.
The first two cases all decided that the SissefccnWahpeton land area had been ceded by the Act of 1891.
The federal District Court, Judge Beck, also held
that, and this case came into the Circuit Court of Appeals,
either argued at St. Paul or St. Louis.
In 1963 the Circuit Court of Appeals of St. Louis
upheld this very action and said that the lands had been
ceded, and this was not Indian reservation.
In 1963, if I have my date correct, the Justice
Department of the United States also argued that the land,
the reservation had been terminated.
In 1973, they have had a change of policy, and they
argued that the reservation was there, according to the
boundaries back in 1867.
And so the Circuit Court of Appeals overruled a long
line of cases, in fact overruled themselves on this area in
South Dakota

6
Our argument, our main thrust of why they did it
is that they blanketly applied Matts, Seymour, the New Town
decisions to this reservation, former reservation.

It gets

confusing.
Our argument simply is this:

the Mattz case and

the Seymour case and this case can easily be distinguished.
We are not asking this Court to overrule your case of
Mattz or your case of Seymour.
Those cases evidently were decided on the rules set
up by this Court? and, for ex ample, in Mattz, they had
tried to open that reservation for a long time and couldn't
get the job done, and your rulings are right there.
But those two cases were decided on the trustee
homestead provision, wherein the government bartered for this
land from the tribe, but they didn't guarantee the sale of
it.

They said, We'll put it up for sale for you, we'll have it

homesteaded; whan that's bid for, then the money will be in
trust for you.
That was the fatal error of the Circuit Court, of
Appeals in this case.

The Circuit Court of Appeals said,

.i.n this Feather case, that this was not a cession agreement.
And it absolutely was.
It said it's like Mattz and Seymour, a trustee type
deal.
.Feather, I don’t know why they decided that, but I

7
think just in

the glare of Matfcz and Seymour.

Now, all of the cases or all of the reservations in
1891, in this Indian Allotment Act, of which Sisseton-Wahpeton
was a part, as far as we have been able to determine were
restored to the public domain, and they were different.
Some had public domain wording, some had wording like this,
the Crow Act had a little different wording.

But, by the

legislative history, by the face of the Act, we could deter­
mine, and from what Senator Dawes says it was going to do,
this seven or eight million acres went to the public
domain.

The Circuit Court of Appeals says that a cession

isn't a cession.
And in

the briefs sometimes we're arguing that

public domain isn’t public domain.
mean "cade" and "sell".

"Cede, sell"8 doesn't

And it’s down to the point, Your

Honors, that this area in so far as can be possibly done
should be decided.

Because since New Town and Matts and

Seymour, this is breaking out, the litigation, all over;
and I don't see any end in sight.
QUESTION; Did you apply for a rehearing in the
Eighth Circuit?
MR. DAY;

I believe that they applied for re­

hearing in the Eighth Circuit, in which I was not involved,
sir, but I'm sure they did.
QUESTION;

Did you get any votes?

8

MR. DAY;

No.

QUESTION:

As far as you know?

MR. DAY;
QUESTION:

I don't believe we did.
That's not always clone publicly, but do

they in the Eighth Circuit?

I'm not familiar — perhaps

Justice Blackman knows the practice; it’s his Circuit.
MR. DAY:

I’ll have you ask Justice Blackman!

I think they do sometimes. Your Honor.
QUESTION: Well, it isn't important, anyway.
MR. DAY:
QUESTION:

No.
Except that the two panels in DeMarrias

and this ~ and hare, were different, although all the judges
are still alive, with one exception.
MR. DAY:

Well, Judge Lay, in a dissenting

opinion a few years ago, I think brought all of this, the
Indian problems to light, and — but
QUESTION:

What case was that?

MR. DAY:

Miner v. Erickson, it was, Your Honor.

And we think that if the State Court decisions are read on
the law, and that the 1963 federal Circuit. Court of Appeals
DeMarrias is read in light of what we'vs argued here today,
that we should go back to the DeMarrias.
A.nd it's distinguishable, we'rs clear on the face,
and I — I think that’s all I have to say, unless there are
some questions.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may want to save a

little time for rebuttal, then.
MR. DAY:

I would like to, sir.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. DAY:

You may.

Thank you,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Sachse,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY R. SACHSE, ESQ.,
FOR THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. SACHSE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I want to say a word first about any Indian
reservation, before talking about -this one, because it seems
to ms that the discussion so far has been a bit confusing
about that.
In almost every Indian reservation in the country
there’s land that has been allotted to Indians, there’s land
that has been sold in fee simple to people who are not Indians.
There’s often a large non-Indian population inside an
Indian reservation.
One of the characteristics of this reservation is
that there’s such a large Indian population inside, and
that there's a going tribe, with an organized government and
an agency of the BIA, and a very alive and viable situation.
Basically, and without trying to get into all of
the details of it, the State in 'which an Indian reservation is

10
situated has full jurisdiction over non-Indians who live inside
an India reservation, both civil and criminal jurisdiction»
This Court held so in a nurober of cases

,

starting in the

Nineteenth Century with McBratney and Drapey which were
criminal cases.

And Justice Frankfurter laid this out in a
?

good deal of detail in Cake vs, Egan and the Metlacotla cases
in about 380 —
QUESTION:
MS. SACHSE:

Is that civil as well as criminal?
Civil as well as criminal.

MR. SACHSE:

QUESTION:

But in present actions with an Indian,

they’re going to be subject to federal law.
MR. SACHSE:

Correct.

If the transaction is with

an Indian or affects the vital interests of the tribe,
they're going to be subject to federal law.

The exact extent

of that is the kind of thing that’s still debated before you,
?

in a case such as the Maserie case that’s under advisement.
QUESTION: And it may be debated eventually in this
caoe, I take it?
MR. SACHSE:

And may eventually be debated here.

Now, I think I need to review some law concerning

II
this Treaty as well as — this reservation, as well as the
facts«
First, briefly to the facts:
A permanent reservation was established by Treaty
in 1867, with surveyed boundaries.

And itss this reservation,

which is much smaller than the land the Indians had previously
had.

They had already had their big loss of land, and this

was what was left to them, after great amounts of land had
been taken away from them.
Then, by an agreement in 1889, made specifically
under the General Allotment Act, and at a time when the
Indians were in great distress, that the moneys owed to them
by the federal government had not been paid to them, it was
the

middle of winter.
The federal government negotiated with the tribe

to do what’s known as open its reservation. That is, to allow
the sale of surplus land .within the reservation.

And in this

agreement and then in the Act of Congress that ratified it,
there are numerous references to the General Allotment Act.
There is no such thing as was true with the north half of the
Colville Reservation, where a particular part of the
reservation was cut off and express language was used, saying
that that has been removed from the reservation.
You’ve heard some talk about the public domain.
What's important in this Act is there is no language saying

12
that tills was returned to the public domain.
QUESTION:
MR. SACHSE:

But you do have language of "cession".
You do have language of "cession", that

is correct.
QUESTION:

Isn't that even stronger?

MR. SACHSEs

But there is no specific area ceded,

what's ceded is what is not allotted —•
QUESTION:

But, as a matter of fact, it's treated

as the public domain.
MR. SACHSE:

I — I don't know what you mean by

that.
QUESTION:

Well, what happened after the ceded

property?
MR. SACHSE:

After the property was ceded, -—
Yes?

domain,by the same system that the public domain was handled.

13
But the Indians were paid for the land.
they paid for it?

How were

It was put in the Treasury of the United

States# to be used for their benefit.

In other words, it's

a bookkeeping entry from one government place to another.
The money — the Indian Agency was maintained, the money was
appropriated by the government as needed for the Indians.
The land was opened for homesteading# but only for homesteading#
not for any purpose.
You have the exact same actual dynamics that occurred
in the south half of the Colville Reservation# which this
Court held in Seymour v. Superintendent# did not abolish that
reservation.
The same dynamic that was done in Matts vs. Arnett#
as to that reservation; namely, the non-Indians got what
they wanted, the Indians got what they could.
got the right to settle that land.

The non-Indians

The Indians got the money

from the settlement of that land# which was small enough.
The question remaining iss What happened to the
federal jurisdiction?

What happened to the jurisdiction of

the tribe?
And I want to approach that problem now.
QUESTIONs Would it be fair to say that the United
States in those transactions was acting as the broker for
the Indians# to announce publicly that settlers could come
in and buy it for §2/50 an acre?

14
MR. SACHSE:

It's exactly so, and we quote in our

brief where one of the Senators objected to the cession idea,,
to the fact that the government would pay the money immediately.
And one of the other Senators explained to him, said;
This doesn't mean anything, because this is just a bookkeeping
transaction in the Treasury.

We get right back the money that

we're going to pay to the Indians, as we sell off the land.
How, in some later Acts, the government decided to
do it the other way, to not pay the Indians at first, to only
pay the Indians as the land was sold.
But the practical effect of both kinds of Acts is
identical, that the Indians kept, lived on the allotted land,
the unallotted land was opened up for homesteading, because
it was thought in this -- this was said to the Indians in the
negotiations, and the Court talked about this in Mattz — this
Court talked about this in Mattz vs. Arnett.
The excuse for doing this kind of tiling was that it
was for the benefit of the Indians to do it, that it was
better for their, to live next to a high caliber of citizen who
would be farming his land, and so forth.

That's -the kind of

language that was used.
And that was the same whether the Indians said they
ceded it first, or said — or the government acted as agent,
disposing of it.
And, by the way, this language "cession" in the Ash

15
Sheep case, which we discuss in

our brief, is used in

connection with an arrangement where the government only acted
purely as agent, where they simply

whenever someone wanted

a piece of the land, would sell it to him then, and give the
money to the Indians.

The word "cede” was used.

But obviously with no technical —
QUESTION; What impact, if anything, did the cession
have, folloxved by the sale for homesteading or the settlement
for homesteading?

What happened as a consequence, or what

was the impact with respect to the jurisdiction of the State,
if anything?
MR. SACHSE;

Of the State?

None.

None.

The cession of the land or the selling in fee
simple of land inside an Indian reservation, say, as in the
reservation in Matts

—- in Seymour vs. Superintendent, the

south half of the Colville.

That then is land owned by a non-

Indian inside an Indian reservation.
QUESTION; Well, yes, but you would apparently think
the State has civil and criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians
on that.
MR. SACHSE;
QUESTION;
MR. SACPISEs

Clearly.
How about the State's trespass law?
The State's — the State's trespass

law would clearly apply to non-Indians, but that would be
— to the extent that it is applying •—

Wall, how about to the owner —* how

about the owner of the deeded land, the ceded land, he now
has a fee simple title to it —
MR. SACHSE:

land, and he does it in the name of the State's trespass law.
May he do so?

Can he keep a non-Indian

off in the name of -the State’s trespass law?
MR. SACHSE;

Clearly, yes.

QUESTION; So the State's law does apply there.
MR. SACHSE;

What

I’m saying is that in a trans­

action between an Indian and a non-Indian —
QUESTION;

Well, I didn’t ask you about transaction,

Mr. Sachs©, I asked you about the State’s trespass law.
Does the State — after the land is deeded, does the
State's trespass law apply to that land?
Certainly it doesn't

17
MR. SACHSE;

It applies to that land as to non-

Indians but not as to Indians.
QUESTIONS
MR. SACHSE %

So an Indian —
The State's criminal law does not

apply to Indians inside an Indian reservation.
QUESTION;

And so it just — so the State

sovereignty just doesn't apply to that land, no matter who
it’s owned by, as far as keeping an Indian off of it is
concerned?
Is that your thesis?
MR. SACHSE;

I think that's correct.

That would be

under federal law or under tribal law, if it's a matter
affecting an Indian inside an Indian reservation.
Now, tha General Allotment Act left a lot of
questions unresolved.

And the early questions that were

unresolved was whether a reservation existed at all after
there had been allotments, and whether even allotted land
was Indian land under federal jurisdiction.
And the Court first addressed that question in
1909, in U.S. vs. Celes tin©, in which it held that even though
land had been allotted to an Indian and patented to the
Indian, that the land remained inside the Indian reservation,
that no land was removed from an Indian reservation until
it specifically removed by Congress from the reservation.

of Indian reservations.

And part of the problem has been

that the federal government hasn't done its job,- the State
hasn't done their job, and the tribes have been too weak to
do anything.
QUESTION:

Well, what is the State’s job?

What

does this State — on an Indian reservation?
MR. SACHSE:
QUESTION:

In this — in a reservation —

On an Indian reservation, what is the

State's responsibility, if any?
MR. SACHSE:

The State’s responsibility in an

Indian reservation is as to non-Indians, to maintain law and
order in matters between non-Indians.

The federal government

and the tribe have responsibility of maintaining law and
order in matters that affect Indians.
And neither one of them should have to look at the

without having to figure out whether a policeman can go on

Yes, and when that happens, that's

If it’s on a reservation, that's right.
But not otherwise.

MR. SACHSE;

If it's off til® reservation, it would

— it would not, that's right; it would be State jurisdiction.
QUESTIONs
MR. SACKSE:

In a civil dispute —
No,

Excuse me, that's

inaccurate.

If it's not on Indian country, it would be State jurisdiction.
There could be Indian country off a reservation.
QUESTION:

Well, yes.

Patented land is Indian

country by statutory definition; correct?
MR. SACHSE:
QUESTION:

That’s right.
In a civil dispute, under Williams v, Lee,

isn’t a federal question, it’s a question for the tribal
court, if it’s on a reservation.
MR. SACHSE:

That’s correct.

That within an

Indian reservation, in a matter affecting Indians, the juris­
diction — the original jurisdiction, the root of the juris­
diction was tribal jurisdiction. But the federal government,
through numerous statutes, has preempted great parts of that
jurisdiction.

And for all major crimes, for instance, there's

federal jurisdiction.

But in a civil dispute between an Indian

and a non-Indian on an Indian reservation, it's tribal
jurisdiction.
That's Williams vs. Lee

21
QUESTION;

Laying aside the major crimes question,

and you had a very simple statement that I understood
thoroughly for a moment or two there — when you said it
doesn't depend on geography or plats, it depends on the racial
origin.
Now, were you confining that to reservations, as
jrou suggested first, cr to Indian country?
MR. SACHSEs
country.

I*m — that is true in Indian

But if you — Indian country is any land inside a

reservation.

If this Court were to hold this reservation had

been abolished by the 1891 Act, which I think would be a
very restrictive and artificial interpretation of what the
Court's done in Matts and in Seymour vs. Superintendent, and
I think it would also undercut 18 U.S.C. 1151 seriously.
At least for this reservation.
QUESTION:

Yes, but go ahead.

If the Court

should hold -MR. SACHSEs

If the Court should hold that, then

each one of these red spots is a little island of federal
and tribal jurisdiction, and we're not in a time now when
these -QUESTION;

That's the way it’s been, isn't it,

as my brother White suggested?
MR. SACHSE;

The way it's been is that everyone has

ignored both the Indian and federal rights there, and this —

22

X don't want to testify, but I don’t think the Court should
assume that the situation has been good, and that you can
assume that because we haven't faced this issue before
that it’s perfectly all right to leave it another fifty years,
QUESTION:

On the other hand, if the Court should

decide that the statute, the cession statute didn't amount
to a conveyance, —
MR, SACHSE:
QUESTION:

Yeah.
— then the result would be that the

State would no longer have any power to enforce its laws in
any of these several counties, if any Indian was involved,
MR. SACHSE:

That's correct.

It wo\ild be a federal

question, as in any other Indian reservation, —
QUESTION: Wherever it occurred.
MR. SACHSE:

— wherever it occurred, and this is

something that Congress has decided is a proper way for the
federal government to exercise its —
QUESTION:
MR, SACHSE:

Well, if this is an Indian reservation,
Yes.

And whether this one is or not,

it would be the same situation you're describing in other
reservations of the State, lthat clearly are reservations.
We're speaking of the proposition that this, what we
call a reservation, where a major tribe lives and where there's
a major number of Indians, should be treated like the other
Indian reservations in the State.

23
QUESTION;

Wall, I suppose the vast proportion —

this is something like, what

,

27,000 non-Indians and a few,

3,000-plus Indians?
MR. SACHSE:
QUESTION;

That's right.
In this Lake Traverse area.

MR. SACHSE:

That's correct.

But we're not trying to subject the non-Indians
to federal or Indian jurisdiction except to the extent
needed to fulfill the trust responsibilities —QUESTION;

Which means that whenever they're

involved with an Indian —■
MR. SACHSEs
QUESTION;

That's right.
— the State does not have any juris­

diction —
MR. SACHSE;
QUESTION;

That’s correct.
— with respect to its civil, criminal

or family or status law.
QUESTION;

It was suggested that the tribe had

recently passed an ordinance that asserted rather ex pansive
jurisdiction within this area.

Is that true or not?

Or do you know?
MR. SACHSE;
that's so.

I haven't seen it.

I’ve heard that

I suspect that it goes beyond the authority that

the tribe has.
QUESTION; Because it reaches non-Indians?

24

MR. SACHSE3

Yes.

QUESTIGN; Well * how do we know that the tribe doesn’ t
have authority to reach non-Indians?
MR. SACHSE;

Well, the McBratney case and the Draper

case in criminal matters.
QUESTION;

Well, all McBratney says is that the

State has the right to try a white man for a crime that took
place on an Indian reservation.

It doesn’t say the tribe

couldn’t try him.
MR. SACHSE;

Well, I suppose I just have to answer

that this has been the — at least tacit holding of this
Court, or assumption of the Court in a number of cases.

And

I refer to Cake v. Egan, where Justice Frankfurter tried to
lay out the limits on tribal jurisdiction.

And it’s never

been faced directly in the last ten years, perhaps, by this
Court, but it has been faced before.

MR. SACHSE;

Well, —
My time is up, and I'm feeling bad

about taking all the time of my partner.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. GUSTAFSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and if the

Court please:
I'd like to try and answer a question or two
possibly that has been proposed here before to some others
on both sides.
I live rather close to this reservation, being
twenty miles away from it.
QUESTION:

As far as this map here contains

You mean this area?

MR. GUSTAFSON:

In this area, that is correct.

I don't live on the reservation now, but —
QUESTION:

The question is whether there is one.

Is there one?
QUESTION: Right.
MR. GUSTAFSON:

Yes.

I don't think there's any

part or any confusion, even by the State, that there is a
reservation on part of this land.
what can we say?

I believe it is their —

that they are admitting, they are

conceding that all of the red area is reservation.
QUESTION:

No, no.

MR. GUSTAFSON:
QUESTION:

It!s Indian country.

It's Indian country.

It. is —■

But not a reservation.

MR. GUSTAFSON:

But that the federal law does apply

26

That the law for the tribe applies on minor crimes.

And let's

come back to 1151, if we may, there on the thing.
We think that 1151(a) is what applies; they are
saying it's 1151(c).
QUESTION s

Yes.

MR. GUSTAFSON;

And as far as we are concerned here,

at this time, it's under the Major Crimes Act that we are
primarily thinking now.
Most of these ten defendants that was on here, on
the tiling — and I’ll grant you, I was the one that filed the
writ of habeas corpus in the District Court in this, after we
had gone through the post-conviction hearing in the State
court, with more defendants; but they were no longer under
sentence, so we didn't proceed with them.
But most of them were for the Major Crime Act.
I don’t know which of you Justices asked, but that was asked.
QUESTION;

You're anxious to have your clients

sentenced under the Major Crimes Act?
MR. GUSTAFSON;

That is true, Your Honor.

They feel

that they get a very much better and very much fairer — they
resent State jurisdiction.

They think that for the past number

of years that they haven’t had justice under State jurisdiction.
Out in our country there is a saying that, ,!a good
Indian is a dead Indian", and that hurts very, very much most
of these Indians.

27
QUESTIONS

Is there anything in the record in this

case that would indicate that the State proceeded unfairly
against them?
MR. GUSTAFSONs

No# and I'm not trying to allege

that the State did proceed unfairly.

I think that in a lot

of instances# Judge# that the ~ when these fellows get behind
bars# they begin to think these tilings.
allege that they did.

I'm not trying to

But because of the sentiment involved

and because it is white men applying that# they very much
resant it; while they don't resent the federal law.
Now# there was one other individual that I did
represent after this group here# that was not involved in
tliis group# who happened to be a white man# who had killed
an Indian# and he 'wanted to be sentenced under the Major
Crime Act.

And under his request we did go in and get him

sentenced under the Major Crime Act.
Which was his request# on a post-conviction hearing.
And w© did do this.

This was done last spring.

The federal

did assume jurisdiction.
QUESTION;

How did you do that?

Under the Eighth

Circuit opinion?
MR. GUSTAFSON;

Under the —• yes# under the Feather

case# after the Feather case cams out —
QUESTION;

After the Feather case was decided

MR. GUSTAFSON;

Yes# after the Feather case cams out#

28

why , the State Circuit Court —
QUESTION:

I understand.

This was then a

reservation.
ME. GUSTAFSON:

Right.

And our State Circuit Court

out there is a court, a trial court.
we're only going to have one court.

In fact, on January 1st
It’s all going to be

the State Circuit Court there.
But that’s what we did, is came back, the State in
reality vacated the sentence on the thing, the feds came in
and arrested him, and I pled him guilty to the same charge
in federal court.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. GUSTAFSON: Which was a murder charge, as far as
that's concerned.

But they were very dubious of this federal

— of this State jurisdiction, and the Indians, I think we
can say, as a whole, vary much dislike the State jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

Well, most people don't like to be tried

in a criminal court.
MR. GUSTAFSON: Well, they seemingly don't have near
the objection, and they think that they get more justice in
the federal courts.

I'm not going to try and say they do, I

have confidence in our Stats court.,
But, neretheless, these Indians do not seem to feel
that way.

And 1 think that that is one factor that is very

hard to control the people, when they feel that they aren't

getting justice? it is very, very difficult.
As far as this tribal resolution is concerned that
has been brought up here# I have been advised that this was
vacated very soon after it was enacted —• tried to be
enacted.

They could see the fallacy.

It was explained by

counsel where they were off on the wrong foot on the thing.
But the big thing that this Feather case has is not
going onto the civil part of the questions that have been
propounded# I realize that they can

come in indirectly.

But it is coining on to this federal jurisdiction# and thin
of course starts out a long viays back.
I think that one thing that comes onto tills
federal jurisdiction that hasn't been brought out here
today — we brought it out in our brief.

And that is in 1901

the State ceded all federal criminal — or ceded to the
federal all State jurisdiction over federal offenses.
And in 1903 the federal assumed this jurisdiction.
We have this in our brief. And it's a thing that the Circuit
Court of Appeals didn’t *— I argued this to them# when we
did argue to the Circuit Court of Appeals there.

In fact#

I’ll grant you, I argued in DeMarrias# I was the culprit on
DeMarrias in the Circuit Court of Appeals as well# there, of
it.
I wasn’t able to do the chores that I should have#

but I# nevertheless# was there.

30

But in the second time, in the Feather case, this
was brought up, it wasn't a controlling factor by them, because
they felt, as wo can very well see their position, that this
Matts case, the New Town case, the Condon case, the Seymour
case all came in and answered this question perhaps easier,
perhaps in a different way, perhaps more definitely than it
was handled or could be handled by this 1903 and this 190.1
Act.
It is a little bit interesting to me, at least,
QUESTION:

I didn't — I missed a little bit what

your argument is, that happened in 1901 and 1903 —
MR. GUSTAFSON:

1901, our State Legislature ceded

to the federal government all of the jurisdiction over all
Indian country, and in 1903 the federal government assumed
this jurisdiction.
So regardless —
QUESTION:

Well, that's question-begging, it doesn’t

answer the question of what is Indian country, doss it?
MR. GUSTAFSON:
QUESTION:

No, it does not.

It does not,

Yeah.

MR. GUSTAFSON: And, as I say, we set forth that in
the brief here on the thing.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. GUSTAFSON:

I believe that it comes back very

directly here on all of these points here that we have before

31
us is?

What is this jurisdiction?
We feel that the case that we have before us, as

far as the criminal is concerned, is very, very much on a
par with the Seymour case, that it's on a par with Mew Town
case, which is of course up there in our federal District
Court, with the Matta case, that it definitely does reverse
DeMarrias.

There's no question about that, that has been

spoken of here today.
But in order to reverse this and go back to
DeMarrias, we believe that it would fo© necessary to ravers©
also the Seymour case.
In fact, after the Seymour case, our State Supreme
Court, in Matts — or in Mo lash, came doi-ra with a very nice
decision on another circuit.

They reversed some other

decisions there, I’ll perhaps pick on them for a minute, that
they did not in their decision say that they were reversing.
They just went ahead \tfifch it.

They came onto those different

parts there of it.
But we believe that we have to go back to this
original case of Celestine, which definitely has the principle
that Congress is the only one that can diminish this
reservation.

That Congress has not diminished, has not

seen fit to diminish this reservation, by 1151 in itself find
1151 especially with the footnotes, and 1153 with the
footnotes, as is brought out in our brief here, on the thing,

32
definitely goes on the principle that Congress is and
knowingly is assuming jurisdiction on all of the reservation
not just the part that is trust land, as the state would have
use believe.
And that's the only thing that makes sense.

If we

don't have such a situation as that, we have the thing that
was brought up right here to start with, and that is a
checkerboard. That is the thing that this Court, in Seymour,
wanted to stray away from, wanted to keep away from on the
thing, and they so ably set it out in Seymour on the tiling.
And if we don't have federal jurisdiction of this
whole reservation, we will come right back into this thing
that you tried to guard against in the Seymour case.
And that is a checkerboarded situation.
a crasy quilt situation.
QUESTION:

Some want to call it

I could ~~

Chief Justice Hughes, in his first tenure

on this Court, way back, conceded that there was bound to be
a checkerboard, as you call it, checkerboard situation with
this hodgepodge of laws and treaties.
him,

I may have misread

„
MR. GUSTAFSONs

I didn't get that idea, and

definitly from Seymour that is what this Court attempted to
avoid.

In fact, they set it out, I think, very, very plainly.

The State in that instance wanted to interpret this as notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, to mean notwithstanding

the issuance of any patent to an Indian.
But the State does not suggest, nor can we find
any adequate justification for the interpretation.

The

issue has been squarely put to rest by congressional enact­
ment of the recently prevailing definition of Indian country
in 1151 to include all land within the limits of any Indian
reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States
Government, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Mr. Day, if you can finish in ten minutes, we*11
finish today and let you get back to the Indian country;
otherwise, we'll go over till tomorrow.
Do you think you can finish in ten minutes?
MR. DAY:

Yes, I can, sir.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

All right.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM F. DAY, JR., ESQ.,

Counsel, my brother, Mr. Gustafson, I am sure, has

I don’t know my brother Sachs©’s information.

Plat book or checkerboard jurisdiction, for officers that
grow up and live in that country, is no big problem.
Because in most instances the land is leased by people, and
most of the crimes are committed in the towns» where it’s
normally all — mostly all fee patented, and there’s no
problem.
Speaking personally, if I can, for a moment, I was
also a tribal judge for about five years out in the Rosebud
Indian — probably was the only white tribal judge in the
United States.

I think I know how it is on closed portions of

reservations, on 1151(a) and also on 1151(c).

That’s not
