PROCEEDINGS
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We’ll hear arguments

next in 73-6650, Brown against Illinois.
Mr. Isaacson, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT P. ISAACSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. ISAACSON:

Mr.' Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The issue is whether tvfo statements, procured
after flagrant and abusive, unconstitutional arrest and
during oppressive, unconstitutional detention, should be
suppressed under Wong Sun versus the United States.
Acting pursuant to official Chicago police
department orders, two Chicago police officers, Nolan and
Lenz, proceeded to Petitioner’s apartment.
They were Investigating the homicide of one
Roger Corpus,

They arrived at Petitioner Brown's apartment

at approximately 4:30 in the afternoon.
Finding noone home, they broke into his apartment.
The officers then searched the apartment and laid In

wait

for nearly three hours for Petitioner Brown's return home.
Now, these officers had absolutely no evidence,
no evidence to link Petitioner Brown to the homicide of
Roger Corpus.

>4

At approximately 7:^5

that evening, your Honors,

when Petitioner Brown returned to hi3 own home, he was
greeted by a drawn gun of Officer Lenz.

Officer Lena jumped

out at him.
Petitioner backtracked a few 3teps and Officer
Nolan greeted him with a revolver in his back and asked the
Petitioner to come on inside the apartment.
At this initial encounter, Petitioner Brown did
not know that these two plainclothes policemen were Chicago
police officers.

They then handcuffed his hands behind his

back, threitf him up against a wall and searched his person.
They hustled him off to a police station
interrogation room where —
QUESTION:

Prom your point of view, Mr. Isaacson,

I suppose it would make no difference if they had met him
outside on the sidewalk and the same events had thereafter
taken place?
MR. ISAACSON:

Your Honor, I believe that the

flagrant and abusive nature in which this unconstitutional
arrest was effected is an important factor in this case.
QUESTION:

But would it make any difference to

your case, if it had occurred out on the sidewalk?
MR. ISAACSON:
your Honor.

The Wong Sun rule would still apply,

This just makes it a stronger case, much stronger

than Wong Sun itself.

As I mentioned, the Petitioner was then hand­
cuffed, his hands behind his back and searched, hustled off
to a police station interrogation room where the same two
police officers who had originally arrested him, the same
two officers, Nolan and Lenz, began an incommunicado interro­
gation.
The interrogation, this initial interrogation,
did not end until a statement was procured from Petitioner.
Sven after the first statement, the police did
not bring Petitioner before a neutral magistrate.

They

continued to unconstitutionally detain him.
They continued to detain him until a second state­
ment was procured from his mouth later, approximately six,
seven hours later.
Not until 14 hours after his unconstitutional
arrest was Petitioner taken before a magistrate.

He was

continuously, uninterruptedly, unconstitutionally detained
by the Chicago police officers.
Based upon these facts, the Supreme Court of
Illinois held that the mere recitation of Miranda warnings
and nothing more,aborts the primary taint of the abusive,
unconstitutional arrest and the ongoing, continuous, uncon­
stitutional detention.
Your Honors, this is not a case where a good
faith effort was made by the police to confoi'm their conduct

6
with this Constitution, with the United States Constitution,.
They acted deliberately to violate the constitu­
tional rights of the Petitioner.

They acted premeditatively..

They laid in wait In his apartment for three hours.

They

had no case against him.
They set out to obtain statements from Petitioner'sQUESTION:

I am sure you are familiar with the

memorandum filed by the United States as

Amicus Curiae in

this case which says that the primary thrust of the arguments
in the state courts, where they went to the voluntariness of
the confession and that the circumstances surrounding the
arrest were rather — not at all thoroughly canvassed and
while the state court found that it was improper and invalid,
an unconstitutional arrest, there really was very little
evidence one way or the other.
And here you are telling us that it is very, very
clear that there was absolutely no cause whatsoever to
arrest him.

I wondered if that indicates that you whole­

heartedly disagree with the Government's submission?
Is that it?
MR. ISAACSON:

We do, your Honor.

The record is

replete with references to the actions of the police officers.
QUESTION:

Well, this Mrs. DeLoach, for example,

who said that she saw the — your client entering the deceasedfe
apartment before the unfortunate murder of the deceased and

7
there is no indication in the record of whether she did or
whether she didn't communicate that information to the
police.
Is that correct?
MR. ISAACSON:

The only information in the

record, your Honor, that was conveyed to the police was a
list of three names, including the name of Petitioner, given
to the police by the deceased's brother, Arthur Corpus.
Now, that list was not a list of three people
whom Arthur Corpus believed to be involved in this.
not have any idea.

He did

He merely gave a list of three indi­

viduals who were acquaintances.
QUESTION:

Whom the deceased knew, right.

Whom

the deceased knew.
MR. ISAACSON:
QUESTION:
incident?

Right.

And then how about this poolroom

What connection, if any, does that have with

this murder — or, it doesn't have any, I suppose.
MR. ISAACSON:
murder.

It has no connection with this

It was — it Just was put in the brief and we are

arguing that it is just further evidence of the Chicago
police —
QUESTION:

Of the overbearing action of the police
.

because they said, you say, erroneously — because they
dishonestly said that the bullet in the ceiling of the

8
poolroom matched your client's gun.
MR. ISAACSON:
QUESTION:

Is that it?

Precisely.

Even though that wasn’t true and they

knew it wasn’t true.
MR. ISAACSON:

That is correct.

Actually, the police officers testified that they
merely told Petitioner that the bullets were sent to the
Chicago Crime Laboratory.

Petitioner testified that they

told him that the bullets matched.
Just talcing the police officer’s testimony, which
stands on the record, this just indicates, along with this
continuous, ongoing, unconstitutional activity which stemmed
from the unconstitutional arrest — we are referring now to
the unconstitutional intention — this just indicates, not
police officers who were bent towards attentuating the taint
of their unconstitutional activity, but to the contrary,
officers who were attempting to exploit the ongoing contin­
uing unconstitutional activity.
A better case for exclusion of Petitioner's
statements can scarcely be imagined from the deterrence point
of vievi.
Again, these officers acted premeditatively
deliberately.

They set out to get a statement, to procure a

statement from Petitioner's own mouth and they did not
stop and —

and

9
QUESTION:

Would you make the same argument if —

wouldn’t you make the same argument if the officers never
said a word to him, but they nevertheless arrested him
unconstitutionally, as you say, and he simply volunteered
anything that happened, that he told them.
They didn’t ask him a single question.
MR. ISAACSON:

If the arrest was merely

unconstitutional, the case would not be as strong.

The

same argument would be made under Wong Sun.
The oppressive nature —
QUESTION:

It would at least be a product of the

unconstitutional arrest -- or would it?
MR. ISAACSON:

Well, it would be if it flovjs

from the unconstitutional —
QUESTION:

Well, what are you arguing?

Are you

arguing that the illegal arrest produced It or that the
officers’ conduct thereafter —
MR. ISAACSON:

The unconstitutional arrest and

the continuing and ongoing unconstitutional detention of
Petitioner.
QUESTION:

Well, now, the arrest had violated the

Fourth and 14th Amendments.

It has been so held.

Was the officers’ conduct thereafter — how was
that unconstitutional?
MR. ISAACSON:

What did it violate, if anything?
They were continuing to hold

10

Petitioner in detention, continuing —
QUESTION:

And that is also a Fourth —

MR. ISAACSON:
violation.

That is also a Fourth Amendment

I would like to point out —
QUESTION:

And you say that the Miranda warnings,

socalled, are directed to nip in the bud any possibility
of Fifth and 14th Amendment violations and they are basically
Irrelevant to a Fourth Amendment violation.
MR. ISAACSON:

Is that it?

The Wong Sun exclusion rule,

your Honor, Involves protection of both the Fourth and Fifth
Amendments through the 14th Amendment.
In view of the strong nature of the police
conduct, in view of the fact that the unconstitutional taint
grew increasingly more exploitive with each additional
minute of unconstitutional detention.
Petitioner’s — both the Petitioner’s statements
should be suppressed.
QUESTION:

Because of the exclusionary rule,

Mapp against Ohio, having to do with the Fourth and 14th
Amendments.

Is that it?
MR. ISAACSON: ' No, because of Wong Sun versus the

United States, which —
QUESTION:

Yes, that is a case, but It is a ease

that construed the Constitution of the United States.
MR. ISAACSON:

Right,

11

QUESTION:

So what is it in the Constitution?

It

is the exclusionary rule applicable to violations of the
Fourth and l^th Amendment, isn't it?
MR. ISAACSON:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Or does it have something to do with

the Fifth and 14th Amendment?

That is my question.

I just

want to be sure I understand your theory.
MR. ISAACSON:

The Fifth Amendment is also

Involved, your Honor, almost

by definition.There were

statements procured from Petitioner's mouth.
QUESTION:

After.

But he had been given Miranda

warnings.
MR. ISAACSON:

Well, we do not even believe that

the Miranda warnings were adequate.

The more narrow issue,

the narrower Issue is before this Court and that is the
adequacy of Miranda warnings.
But in view of the continuing ongoing unconsti­
tutional taint, were these Miranda warnings, as given,
sufficient to

cut off the taint?

I would like to sell

with the

12
MR. ISAACSON:
QUESTION;

That's correct.

Mr. Isaacson, what if, contrary to

the situation that apparently is involved here,

there had

been an unconstitutional arrest and ycur client had simply
been put in detention and nobody was with him at all.
been given Miranda warnings.

He had

He then decided he wanted to

the lawyer, said,"! want to spill it.iV
Would that be suppressible because the original
arrest was illegal?
MR. ISAACSON:

If Petitioner had conferred with

an attorney, that would be sufficient.

Or if Petitioner was

taken before a neutral magistrate to be informed of his
right to an attorney by an independent party in order to
place a neutral individual between the Petitioner and these
officers, the arresting, interrogating officers, that would
have been sufficient.
QUESTION:
rule, then?

You don't contend for a "but for"

"But for" the arrest, he never would have made

the statement.
MR. ISAACSON:
QUESTION:
contending it.

We do not contend that.

Well, Just awhile ago you were

I said, what if he simply volunteers anything

that was said, he volunteered after illegal arrest, the
officers didn't say a word.

I thought you said

you would

13
make the same argument?
MR. ISAACSON:

To say volunteered, your Honor, any

notion of Petitioner volunteering a statement in this case is
totally negated by the facts of the case.
The police set out originally to get a statement
from him and they were successful.
QUESTION:

Well, I don't know.

If the arrest

hadn't been illegal, but legal and there had been no Miranda
warning, the statement would be excludable.
But with Miranda warnings, any possibility of
involuntariness is apparently squelched.
MR. ISAACSON:

But, your Honor, the

case of this

Court, the companion case to Miranda versus Arizona,
Westover versus the United States, held that the other
circumstances surrounding the statement can negate the pro­
tection normally afforded by the Miranda warnings.
The facts in Westover were such that Westover was
detained by the Kansas City Police who questioned him for 14
hours.

"
QUESTION:

You are going to get into an argument

about Miranda and the reach of the Pifth Amendment now, rather
than a Fourth Amendment case.
I think the question still Is whether or not — it
sounds as though there is a substantial question here as to
whether the police conduct after the arrest Is what Is at

14
Issue here.
MR. ISAACSON:

We suggest that an analogy can be

drawn between the protection afforded by Wong Sun of Fourth
and Fifth Amendment rights and the protection afforded by
Miranda of Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights,
In Miranda, the right to counsel under the Sixth
Amendment was deemed to be protections a necessary ingredient
of one's Fifth Amendment right for privilege against self­
incrimination.
Similarly9 the case in Wong Sun, that is, that
one's Fourth Amendment rights, the right against unrea­
sonable searches and seizures, are thought necessary to
protect one's Fifth Amendment rights.
And Westover fairly holds — to get back to the
facts — after 14 hours of detention by the Kansas City
Police, Westover was turned over to the FBI who immediately
gave Miranda warnings.
QUESTION:

Westover then made a statement.
It was more than Miranda warnings.

MR. ISAACSON:
Westover made a statement.

It was more than Miranda warnings.
This Court viewed the detention

as one continuous 14-hour detention.

This Court did not

merely focus on the giving of the Miranda warnings in a
vacuum, as the Supreme Court of Illinois did and as
Respondents advocate here.
What they did was look at the continuing

15
attendant circumstances and this Court held in Westover that
the more oppressive the prior and attendant circumstances
surrounding the taking of custodial statements, the less
weight to which the warnings were constitutionally entitled.
In this case, your Honors, we submit that those
warnings were entitled to little if any weight.
In view of the ongoing — in summary, in view of
the ongoing, continuous, unconstitutional activity by the
Chicago police officers, both the Petitioner’s custodial
statements during his unconstitutional detention should be
suppressed.
I’d like to reserve my remaining time for
rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
QUESTION:

Very well.

May I ask, whatever happened to

Jimmy Cleggett?
MR. ISAACSON:
QUESTION:

He was not prosecuted, your Honor.

What effective sanctions, in your

estimation, are there against police conduct of the kind that
occurred here?

Just the exclusionary rule?

MR. ISAACSON:

The only effective sanction, your

Honor,
Thank you.
QUESTION:

What about Bivens?

MR. ISAACSON:

The Bivens case?

Individuals have expressed

16
reservations about the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule
but even those individuals
referring now to Professor
and
Dellin Oaks and others, do not deny its applicability to
cases where confessions are involved, where statements are
involved and in addition, the exclusionary rule, whatever
place it has, in a good faith attempt by police to comply
their activities to the Constitution, the case cannot be
stronger for its application in the present case where they
set out to achieve something, ths? set out to get statements,
and
/they did it in a flagrantly unconstitutional manner.
QUESTION:

Did Justice Schaeffer sit on the ease

in the Illinois Court?
MR. ISAACSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, he did, your Honor.

Did he join the majority?

MR. ISAACSON:

Yes, he did.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Miss Carr.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MISS JAYNE A. CARR
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MISS CARR:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The issue presented by this case is whether,
following an arrest without probable cause, the subsequent
giving of Miranda warnings to a suspect in custody prior to
police custodial Interrogation will obviate or attenuate any
taint arising from the Initial unconstitutional arrest.

IT
This* in effect, was the holding of the Supreme
Court of Illinois In this case, that the giving of Miranda
warnings per se would obviate the taint from what they found
to be an arrest without probable cause.
Prior to beginning my argument, I would like to
make certain corrections as to factual misconceptions in this
case.
QUESTION:
a moment?

Miss Carr, might I Interrupt you for

You said a minute ago that the Supreme Court of

Illinois held that the giving of Miranda warnings per se was
an attenuation.

Do you think they meant that It would

Invariably be or that it had had *,hat effect In this
particular case?
MISS CARR:

I believe, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

that they held that under the circumstances of this particular
case, the giving of Miranda

warnings was sufficient to

obviate any ta3.nt from the initial unconstitutional arrest.
One of the factors that was extremely relevant to
the Court’s position on that point was the fact that
initially there had been a hearing prior to trial on the
admissibility of these two statements, both the Initial state­
ment given to the police officer and the second later state­
ment given to the assistant state’s attorney.
The Amicus brief filed on behalf of the United
States by the Solicitor General attempts to make the point

18
that this case is akin to the situation in Morales versus
New York in which a proper disposition would be to remand the
case after vacating the judgment for a further hearing to
determine whether or not there are facts which would con­
stitute probable cause.
I think that the Solicitor General misreads
Illinois practice in this respect.
Illinois provides for a pretrial motion to
suppress filed by a defendant in which the defendant files
a motion in vrriting alleging specific grounds in support of
suppression.

Defendant In this case, in faot, filed such a

motion alleging as one of the grounds that the arrest was
without probable cause.
After the motion is filed the state then has
the burden of going forward with the evidence and the burden
of proof by a preponderance to show that;the confession is,
in fact5 admissible.
There was a hearing in this case at which the
state did go forward with proof but offered no proof as to
the existence of probable cause.
The trial court denied the motion to suppress on
a finding that the confession was voluntary and the Supreme
oourt of Illinois proceeded in this case on the assumption
that the confession was voluntary and had been given after
full compliance with Miranda warnings but that the initial

1$
arrest was, in fact, without probable cause.
In making

his

opening statement»

counsel on

behalf of the Petitioner indicates that at the time of the
arrest, the Petitioner was not aware that Officers Nolan
and Lens were, in fact, police officers.
This is refuted by the record on the motion to
suppress in that both officers testified that immediately
upon contacting the Petitioner as ha approached his apartment
that each officer told him he was under arrest and after he
was placed under arrest and a brief search was conducted for
weapons he was, in fact, told that he was under arrest either
for questioning or for Investigation of a murder.
He was, at that point, taken immediately to the
police station, which took approximately 10 to 15 minutes.
He was taken directly to an interrogation room at the police
station which contained a window, a table and

several chairs.

At that point, the officers left the room for
five to 10 minutes to obtain their .file, came back lnf,o the
room and proceeded to give the defendant, prior to speaking
with him, four Miranda warnings as required by this Court’s
decision in Miranda versus Arizona.
There is the point made in passing by the
Petitioner's counsel, both here and in its brief, that these
Miranda warnings were inadequate in that the officer did not
advise the defendant that he was entitled to the services of

20
an appointed counsel if he could not afford retained counsel.
This is, in fact* refuted by the record on the
motion to suppress.

Officer Lenz, on direct examination,

did omit the particular reference to the ability to have
appointed counsel which — that may be found at page 7 of
the abstract.
However, on cross-examination by defense counsel,
the officer was again asked to go through what specific
warnings he gave to the defendant at the time of the arrest
mid he did, in fact, at that time, relate four Miranda
warnings.

Those learnings may be found at page 19 of the

abstract.
The other officer who was present at the time the
warnings were given. Officer Nolan, testified consistently
that the warnings were, in fact, complete as required by
Miranda versus Arizona.

His testimony may be found on direct

examination at page 37 of the abstract and on cross-examin­
ation at pages 45 and 46.
It should be emphasised that the first statement
given by this defendant after he was taken into custody
was given within 45 minutes of his arrest and — I’m sorry,
within an hour of his arrest and within 45 minutes of his
arrival at the police station.
The sequence of events as related by the testimony
indicates that he was arrested, was taken immediately to

21
the police station, was given Miranda warnings and

ques­

tioning began, at which point, the defendant indicated that
he chose the course of telling the truth, giving the officers
the information that was taken down in a half-hour statement
which t?as admitted at trial through the testimony of Officer
Nolan.
Following this discussion, the defendant then
chose to go with the police officers to locate Jimmy Cleggett.
The officers and the defendant were out on the street for a
period of three to four hours, during x^hich time the
petitioner and the officers were in and out of the

squad car

looking into various business establishments in an effort to
locate Cleggett.
They were successful in that effort, returned to
the police station around midnight or 12:30.

An assistant

stated attorney was called and while defendant was waiting for
the assistant to arrive, he was not questioned.
When the assistant state’s attorney did arrive,
the assistant gave him four Miranda warnings once again,
asked him if he wished to speak with the assistant, the
defendant said yes, he did, that he wished to make a statement.
There was a brief conversation with the assistant
in private and following the arrival of a court reporter,
there was a formal written statement taken, again, after the
defendant had been further advised of his Miranda rights.

22
This statement the Petitioner declined to sign
after it was transcribed but it was admitted into evidence
at trial.
There was also a reference in both the Solicitor's
brief and Petitioner's brief to the fact that the police
officers told the Defendant that the bullets which had been
removed from the ceiling of the poolroom in fact matched the
bullets taken from the body of Roger Corpus,
This is not supported by the record.

There was

a stipulation entered by the state on trial and there was a
stipulation offered on the motion to suppress that the
bullets, in fact, were not able to be compared and therefore
it is not clear whether or not they would have matched had
there been a comparison made.
The testimony of the two police officers on the
motion to suppress indicates that all they told the defendant
during the course of questioning prior to his first state­
ment was that the police were aware of the poolroom Incident;,
had secured the bullets and had transported them to the
crime

lab for comparison with the bullets taken from the

body of the victim.
There was nowhere in the record, except for the

testimony of the Petitioner on the motion to suppress, any
reference to the officers telling the Defendant that his
fingerprints had been found in the apartment of Roger Corpus,

23
the victim.
The trial Judge in this case, in denying the
motion to suppress, it could
the testimony of the

be fairly described, rejected

Defendant in respect of the particular

point that the Petitioner's counsel here raises as to deceit
or trickery on behalf of the police officers.
The basis of the decision below was, in fact, that
the concession in this case, both the first statement to the
police officers and the second statement made to the
assistant state's attorney were voluntary statements given
after full compliance with Miranda.
The issue, then, presented to this Court for a
decision is whether, following the decision in Wong Sun, the
giving of Miranda warnings will, in and of themselves, obviate
the taint from any Initial unconstitutionality in the arrest
procedures without more.
The Respondent wishes to make the point that this
is a narrow issue.

Its basis primarily is in the fact that

abatement in this case is in all other respects voluntary
and was given after full compliance with Miranda warnings, a
knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of those rights.
QUESTION:

Can I put a little footnote as to how

voluntary his confession was?
Now, are you talking about the one he refused
to sign?

MISS CARR:

I am talking about both statements,

Mr. Justice Marshall.
QUESTION:

Well, you say that the one he refused

to sign is obviously voluntary?
MISS CARR:

In the sense that the trial judge,

prior to the trial, heard evidence on the specific issue of
voluntax’iness and found in denying the motion that the
statements, both statements, were voluntary and admitted the
statements at trial.
QUESTION:
court found it.

There is a difference in saying the

You were saying it as a fact.

MISS CARR:
QUESTION:

The trial judge —
Well, I, for one, don't think that

the statement was voluntary if somebody refused to sign it.
I have great problems with that.
Why don’t you sign something that is voluntary?
MISS CARR:

Well, perhaps the Defendant had

second thoughts about whether or not he wished to make a
statement but —
QUESTION:
MISS CARR:

To volunteer.
— but that does not affect the fact

that at the time of the statement it was made after full
intimation to the Defendant as to his rights to make or not
to make a statement and also to have an attorney present.
QUESTION:

Was he also advised of his rights not

25
to be Illegally arrested?
MISS CARR:
QUESTION:

I'm sorry, I did not hear the question.
Was he also advised of his rights not

to be illegally and unconstitutionally arrested?
MISS CARR:

No, Judge, he was not.

But the fact that the initial arrest here was
made without probable cause does not affect the fact that
subsequent to that arrest, the police officers took the
Defendant directly to the police station, gave him full
Mi rail da warnings and at that point in time, he voluntarily
and Intelligently and knowingly chose

to wa±ve his rights to

speak or not to speak, to secure the presence of an attorney
or not, and chose to make a statement to the police officers
which after — in full evidentiary hearing, was found to be
voluntary.
In this situation, the fact that the Initial
arrest was made without probable cause does not in and of
Itself render the subsequent statement inadmissible into
evidence.
This Court, in Wong Sun versus the United States ,
indicated that It would not follow a per se exclusionary rule
in this type of situation and did apply a test other than the
"but for" test.
In other words, the test was not the "But for the
illegal arrest the statement would not have been brought about

26

The test is whether or not the police officers,
following an unconstitutional arrest, exploit that initial
illegality in securing the statement.
In the factual context of this case, where the
statement is in all other respects voluntary, it can hardly
be said that the police officers exploited the initial
illegality of the unconstitutional arrest when they made
particular efforts to give this Defendant full Miranda
warnings and allow him —
QUESTION:

It sounds, then, as though you are

plugging for a rule that the Miranda warnings are automati­
cally in per sp-, sufficient to obviate the taint.
MISS CARR:
where the statement

That is correct, Mr. Justice White,
given after Miranda warnings is in

all other respects voluntary.
QUESTION:

To a —

And that the circumstances otherwise

are just Irrelevant, as long as it Is voluntary?
MISS CARR:

Well, we make the point in our brief

that in particular situations where the initial circumstances
attendant to the arrest are particularly aggravated, those
circumstances are initially taken into consideration in the
determination of voluntariness of the statements but once a
statement has been found to be voluntary, the giving of
Miranda warnings and a voluntary and intelligent waiver there­
of should, without more, render that statement admissible In

evidence.
This is quite unlilce the situation that the
Court was faced with in Wong Sun.
QUESTION:

So you are saying that as long as you

give the Miranda warnings, the statement should be admissible
any time that It would have been admissible, had the arrest
been legal?
MISS CARR:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
All the others — the fact of the

illegal arrest and —- just washes out once you give Miranda
warnings.

Then you are just as though the arrest were legal.
MISS CARR:

Insofar as the statement has been

admissible.
QUESTION:

Miss Carr, what is — there has been a

wrongful arrest here and immediate Miranda warnings and then
they search the man at the station and find the murder weapon
on him.

Would the Miranda

warnings make that admissible, in

spite of the illegal arrest?
MISS CARR:

We make the point in our brief that

given the current state of the interpretation of the Fourth
Amendment exclusionary rule, that situation would present a
more substantial question than the situation we have here.
One of the points that we make in the brief is
that there should be substantial consideration given by this
Court since the Petitioner premises his position here on the

Fourth and l^th Amendments to a reconsideration of the
exclusionary rule and its extension to situations like that.
I think it is a little more questionable in that
situation whether or not the Miranda warnings would, in that
situation, obviate the taint because of the fact that the
Defendant is being confronted with a physical item of
evidence which probably would be suppressible.
QUESTION:

There is nothing voluntary about his

submission to the search, I presume.
MISS CARR:

That is correct.

The reason why —

one of the reasons that we point out the fact that this
case is more properly a Fifth Amendment rather than a Fourth
Amendment case is that unlike the situation in Wong Sun,
which is a case decided by this Court prior to Miranda
versus Arizona, there is now a substantial difference between
verbal and physical evidence.
A defendant who is subjected to an unconstitu­
tional arrest and a search incident thereto really has no
choice as to whether or not that search will or will not be
made,

That situation is substantially different where you

have a situation like the present case, ’where the defendant
was initially arrested without the probable cause, taken to
the police station, given four Miranda warnings and then at
that point has the freedom to make the choice of whether or
not he will speak— and here this is exactly \*hat happened.

The Defendant had the opportunity to make this
choice.

He made the choice to speak.
It is not recognized that a defendant in a

criminal prosecution is not required to make these types of
choices but that he must, prior to making these choices, be
fully informed of what his constitutional alternatives are.
This, in fact, occurred in this case and after
he had been fully advised of his rights and chose to waive
those rights, the statement is in all other respects, in
terms of traditional concepts of voluntariness, admissible
in evidence anc. should be admissible after the giving of
Miranda warnings despite the fact that there is

an initial

arrest without probable cause.
This Court, in Wong Sun did ground its position
on the Fourth Amendment but that case, as I noted, was prior
to Miranda versus Arizona and there is a recognition in that
opinion for the fact that at that point in time this Court
saw that perhaps there was very little difference between
physical and verbal evidence because of the fact that most
people, as is noted in Footnote 12 of the opinion, did not
realize that they had the right to talk or not to talk

when

being questioned by a police officer.
The decision in Miranda versus Arizona, in fact,
supplied that information to an in-custody

defendant, whefche

or not he is in custody with or without probable cause and

30
once he Is fully informed of his rights under the Fifth
Amendment and chooses to speak, that statement, despite
the fact of the initial Illegality, can hardly be said to
be tainted by that illegality, that it could have come about
by exploitation of the police officer's initial arrest
without probable cause.
There is another alternative argument which we
make in our brief in support of the fact that there really
is no sound basis for deciding this case on Fourth Amendment
terms and that is, the inefficacy of the Fourth Amendment
exclusionary rule itself.
We are forced to make this argument in this case
because the Petitioner does. In fact, ground his position in
this case on strictly Fourth and 14th Amendment grounds, as
Mr. Justice Stewart was asking before.
There are alternative remedies under the Fourth
Amendment for the exclusionary rule, as I believe Justice
Biackmun, in his reference to Bivens —
QUESTION:

Let me make sure I understand this.

Suppose there had been no Miranda warnings given here.

Every­

thing else happened just like it happened, except no
Miranda warnings, questions, answers, statements.
Would you suggest that the exclusionary rule,
modified as you think It should be, apparently, should be
so modified as not to exclude these statements, had there

31
been no Miranda warnings?
MISS CARR:

In that situation, I would still view

this case as primarily a Fifth Amendment case In the absence
of Miranda warnings where they in and of itself affect the
admissibility of the statement.
That is precisely the reason why we suggest that
the Fifth Amendment Is much more effective in its dealing
with this type of situation where there is verbal evidence
than the Fourth Amendment because the procedural safeguards
which have been clearly enunciated by this Court under the
Fifth Amendment do, in fact, work.
QUESTION:

Well, you are Just saying then, that

we Just ought to forget about verbal statements being a
product of a — being the result of an unconstitutional
arrest?
MISS CARR:

There may be situations, as I was

referencing, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

Well, in regard to this situation, it

Is because taey are involuntary and they violate the Fifth
Amendment.
MISS CARR:

There may be also the situation, as

we noted in our brief and as I was indicating in my response
to Mr. Justice Rehnquist*s question, where the circumstances
of the arrest and the confrontation — for example, if a
defendant Is taken into custody without probable cause, even

32

given hia Miranda warnings and not questioned, but placed In
a line-up and identified by a complaining witness, told he
was identified and then gave a statement, the situation under
the traditional and current concepts, the exclusionary rule —
the Fourth Amendment is a little bit different because in
tht situation, it is much more akin to a seizure of physical
evidence than it is of verbal evidence.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose I just put it to you —

let's suppose that the question In this case is whether or
not the exclusionary rule should make these statements
Inadmissible, assuming there were no Miranda warnings here.
Let's just assume that the statements will be
considered products of an unconstitutional arrest.

Then

the question is, should they be excludable under a rational
exclusionary rule?
MISS CARR:
QUESTION:

Would you say —
Under a rational exclusionary rule —
Would you think that the conduct of

the police in this case was such that it ought to be
deterred by having the evidence excluded?
MISS CARR:

The problem with applying the Fourth

Amendment exclusionary rule to that type of statement Is
that there is absolutely no empirical evidence that, no
matter how flagrant or how technical the police officers'
error Is, that the exclusion of that evidence entirely Is
not going to deter that type of conduct and in that situation,

33
the proper concern should not be for whether there is a
violation, either technical or flagrant, but whether or not
the evidence that was given by the suspect was, in fact,
reliable and voluntarily given by him and I think the
consideration in that situation is much more proper and much
more consistent with the integrity of the criminal process
to seek the truth.
In that situation, then, to apply a per se rule
of exclusion because of some Initial illegality where the
officers' actions may be either the product of a misconception
of the law, a misconception by a magistrate if there is a
warrant involved or —
QUESTION:

Well, apparently, though, you would

give the same answer if the officers knew they were —
absolutely knew and were deliberately violating the Fifth
and Fourth Amendment rights.
MISS CARR:

Let me males it quite clear I do not

condone that type of action on behalf of a police officer.
QUESTION:

Yes, but you nevertheless would have

the same result.
MISS CARR:

It should not have — what motivates

the officers' conduct should not have — except on the
determination as to whether or not the particular item of
evidence should be admissible.

There should be other viable

34
remedies to alter or deter that type of illegal police
conduct where there is a knowing and flagrant violation but
to totally disregard the integrity of the evidence and the
truthfulness and propriety of admissibility of that evidence
absent the initial illegality is to do great injustice,
really, to the essence of the criminal justice system in
this country which is, in fact, to find the truth.
QUESTION:

What you are really — unless I mis­

understand you and you tell me if I do — I am — in
expressing this understanding of the argument, I am not
being critical of it, but as I understand it, what you are
really 3aying is that now that Miranda has been decided, we
ought to forget about and overrule VJong Sun.
Is that about it?
MISS CARR:

I think that 3ince Miranda has been

decided, there are certain factual premises on which Wong
Sun has been — and legal premises on which Wop.g Sun is
grounded which are no longer true and the most evident and
t he most' important of those is the

Court’s assumption in

Wong Sun that there was no difference between verbal and
physical evidence.
I think with the decision in Miranda that is no
longer true, Mr. Justice Stewart.
QUESTION:

And now that we have those safeguards

and so long as they are there to protect the Fifth Amendment

35
right, against compulsory self-incrimination verbally, there
is no need to pay any attention any more to V/ong Sun, except
with respect to material evidence, such as in a case like
Davis against Mississippi.
MISS CARR:
QUESTION:
down to?

Well, I think —
Isnt that about what your argument comes

Or am I mistaken?
MISS CARR:

of Blackie Toy

Not necessarily as to the statements

in Wong Sun because I think no matter which

test you are applying in that particular situation, you are
probably going to reach the same results.
QUESTION:

Because we would have reached that

result had Miranda been decided before Wong Sim, we would
have reached the same result in Wong Sun because of the
absence of the Miranda warnings.
MISS CARR:

As to Blackie Toy

but also, the

point that I am trying to make is where you, under the test
that the Respondent is suggesting here where you consider any
aggravated circumstances of the initial arrest In determining
voluntariness, that situation is taken care of in the sense
of the Blackie Toy situation where the circumstances of the
Initial arrest are particularly aggravated and a court would
probably have found that that statement was not admissible
as being involuntary under the Fifth Amendment which, it is
our poisition, is the more proper rule to apply to verbal

36
statements.
As to the statement made by Wong Sun in the Wong
Sun decision', it is interesting to know that this Court, in
finding that the taint was attenuated as to his statement,
considered

as one of the factors in attenuation the fact

that-he had been arraigned before a magistrate and thus
informed of his constitutional rights, very similar to the
situation we have here where the defendants were given
Miranda warnings both by the police officers and by the
assistant state’s attorney before each of the statements.
QUESTION:

Because all of those magistrates5

warnings, Just as all of the Miranda warnings in this case,
could not undo the wrongful arrest.
MISS CARR:

That is correct and this Court

specifically rejected the "but for" test in the Wong Sun
decision, as most courts,

since Wong Sun, have.

There are very few courts, there are only one
or two exceptions to the rule and they are noted in our
brief, but

most courts in this country follovr the rule that

an illegal arrest does not render per se any subsequent
statement — any inadmissible per se, any subsequent state­
ment .
QUESTION:

Well,

w ould
/
the rule you are contending

for, Miss Carr, lead you to say that if

the officers not

merely arrested this man but, say, ransacked his house at

37
the time they arrested him, went through hia drawers and his
desk and so forth and ultimately came up with incriminating
evidence, that that should be admissible without regard that
the legality that the arrest or the search —?
MISS CARR:

As to the physical evidence of

evidence?
QUESTION;
MISS CARR;

Yea.
That issue la really not directly

presented by this case in the posture that we put the
*$ 31 clusi on ary rule in^ in terms of its lack of effectiveness,
that is correct.
The fact that the initial illegality technically
taints the evidence does not affect its inherent reliability
or credibility.

Of course, depending on the nature of the

evidence.
But one of the basic criticisms of the Fourth
Amendment exclusionary rule is the fact that it excludes
evidence of unquestioned reliability because of a. basically,
in most cases, technical violation and in some cases a
flagrant violation of Fourth Amendment rights and it does
substantial resulting harm to society and very little benefit
in terms of any deterrent effect at all.
Quite often, a police officer, when that
determination of initial illegality is made, is totally
unaware of eh© disposition of the case because quite often

38
it occurs on appeal.
QUESTION;
defendant's

It at least vindicates this particular

Fourth Amendment rights, the invocation of the

exclusionary rule.
MISS CARR;

Not really, because once his rights

have been violated, there really is no way to repair the
initial violation.
QUESTION;

Well, I presume the argument is that

one way to try to at least rehabilitate him or to rehabil­
itate his right is to say that what you get as a result of
the violation ought not to be used against him.
MISS CARR;

That is one of the premises of the

adoption of the exclusionary rules and its applicability to
the states was to deter that type of police misconduct,

In

it has been shown quite clearly that It
does not have that effect.
QUESTION;

You are saying, I gather, that if the

issue were here, you would also suggest that we scrap Mapp.
MISS CARR:

That is correct.

QUESTION;

Yes.

QUESTION:

If I understood your friend correctly,

and he will perhaps explain it If I didn't, he responded to
Mr. Justice White that if, after he had got to the police

«station and had the Miranda warning ■— which he said was not
enough to euro this problem — he then had his counsel come
and advise him and then made all these statements, that he
would say that that washed out the problem.
Now, are you equating the Mrancla warning with
advice of counsel, in effect?
MISS CARR:

In effect, the situation in those two

circumstances is really no different because in that situation
all the defendant has done is chosen an alternative action
to the one exercised by the defendant in this case.
In that situation, after full compliance with
Miranda, h© chose not to speak but to confer with his
attorney, which la his right.
QUESTION:
MISS CARR:

Well, then —
It is also his right to waive his right

to the presence of counsel and his right to remain silent
and to make a statement, as the Petitioner did her®.
QUESTION:

Then what you are saying, in effect, if

I understand your argument, is that once a Miranda

warning

is given at the station or, alternatively, the mail has ad vis®

would in either of those cases, how h© got to the police
station is irrelevant to the issue.
Is that right?
MISS CARR:

In terms of whether or not the arrest

was —
QUESTION:
MISS CARR:

Voluntariness.
And whether or not the statement is

voluntary.
It Is our position that if the statement is
voluntary, and the product of — although, the initial
custody resulted from an arrest without probable cause, if
the statement was preceded by complete Miranda warnings and
voluntary waiver thereof, that the statement should be
admissible in evidence despite the fact that the initial
custody was unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

What is the name of that case, a good

Circuit involving the claim that because the extradition had
been wrong, the trial could not take place?

Frisby against Collins.

would be an analogy to your argument, wouldn’t It?
Do you know that case?
MISS CARR:

I think it would and that is an

example — that situation is an example of the alternatives

41
available to

obviate police misconduct.

If the situation

you are referring to, Mr. Justice Stewart, is the fact that
the Court held that there «as no — that how —
QUESTION:

How he got into the court didn't make

any difference, as long as he had a fair trial.
MISS CARR;

Right.

But where alternative sanctions

misconduct for a polioe officer and that could be one of the
underlying bases for the opinion.
QUESTION:
MISS CARR:

Right.
The Respondents would respectfully

be affirmed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Isaacson, do you

have anything further?
To avoid Interrupting you, let me put a question
to you along the lines I had just suggested.
What is it about the advice of counsel that, in
your view, apparently breaks the chain that distinguishes
it from the Miranda warning?
I take it you indicated there was a great
difference.

I wonder if you would pinpoint that a little

more fully.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT P. ISAACSON, ESQ.
MR. ISAACSON:

I was talking and referring before.

42
your Honor, to the advice of counsel before any statement
was given.
The difference between that situation and the
case before this Court is that a party on behalf of
Petitioner — party is present with the Petitioner.
It cuts off the continuing, ongoing taint of the
unconstitutional activities by the police department.
Mow, these same officers who arrested Petitioner,
your Honor, were the same who Interrogated him and I submit
to this Court that Petitioner had not meaningful choice to
view this case merely as a voluntary case. Is Incorrect.
It totally Ignores Wong Sun.

Wong Sun involves

the protection of both rights.
When Petitioner was arrested in this flagrant and
oppressive manner, what chance did he have with these
officers?

What chance did he have when they laid In wait

In his apartment for two or three hours and surprised him
with drawn guns?
They were not acting under a color of constitu­
tional law.

They were acting with total disrespect and

disregard of the Fourth Amendment of the United States
Constitution.
They were after the confession, the statement.
They stated in their own words it was an arrest for
investigation or interrogation and they procured that

<43
statement before they took him before a neutral magistrate.
They procured that statement because that is what
they set out to do and what meaningful choice did Petitioner
have when they proceeded to give Miranda warnings and we even
contest the adequacy of the waiver, when these officers were
violating the constitutional rights from the very minute, the
very minute he saw them.
QUESTION:

They were —

Does not a Miranda warning, by its very

nature, constitute something that should be given before any
appearance before the magistrate?
Once a man has appeared before the magistrate, he
doesn’t need a Miranda warning, does he?
MR. ISAACSON:

Miranda warnings should be jjiven

prior to any interrogation, your Honor.

The point in this

case is that Miranda warnings ~ whatever effect Miranda
warnings have — and I would sell youi> Honors the New Haven
study in the Yale haw Journal. ?6 Yale Law Journal 1519, where
the only Indepfch study of the Miranda warnings were under­
taken.
Thera the study held — the study made findings
that whatever effect Miranda warnings had, the effect was
very small,.

The accused generally did not believe that the

police would be giving him these warnings if, in fact, they
didn’t have something on him.
But these warnings — the Miranda case itself only

speaks to the generally oppressive atmosphere of in-custodial
interrogation.
It does not speak to the additional coercive
atmosphere of these arresting, interrogating officers.
These officers, who deliberately and designedly
intended to violate the constitutional rights of the
Petitioner.
These were the same two that hustled him off
into an Interrogation room.
QUESTION:

Would your argument be different if

they were a different set of officers?
MR. ISAACSON:
but Wong Sun

The case would not be as

would still apply.

strong

The point is here, what

meaningful legal choice the Petitioner had when these same
two officers who had flagrantly violated his constitutional
rights tell him that he has other constitutional rights
and merely recite Miranda warnings to him?
They continued to Illegally and unconstitutionally
exploit not only the unlawful arrest, but the continuing
unlawful detention.
I would cite your Honors to the recent case of
gerstein versus Pugh by this Court which came down in late
February and this Court held that the Fourth Amendment
includes — provides protection to a defendant who is
unconstitutionally detained.

45
This Is unconstitutional detention going directly
from an unconstitutional arrest at gunpoint.
They assaulted Petitioner in his own apartment.
They kidnapped him to the police station.

They put him in a

small interrogation room and they continued to Incommunicado
interrogate him.
The Miranda

warnings were not meant to go after

this situation.
QUESTION:

What would the situation be. In your

view* if he had been taken immediately to a magistrate and the
magistrate had don© the usual things and then he came back to
the police station in custody and was Interrogated and made
the same statements?
Would you say that the Intervention of the
as
magistrate would have the same consequence /the intervention
of his lawyer?
MR, ISAACSON:

.

*•

The intervention of the magistrate,

your Honor, would attenuate the taint, based on the case that
you gave me.
The difference is, we are not asking for a "but
for" exclusionary rule.

We are merely asking, when the

police act unconstitutionally, premedltatlvely and deliberately
and when they are out after statements and when they get
those statements — to be sure, when they procure those
statements, before bringing Petitioner before a neutral

*

magistrate — in other words, they continually, ongoingly
exploit the unconstitutional arrest and detention, those
statements must be suppressed because to not suppress those
statements is to sanction the police conduct that occurred
in the present case.
It is to sanction the Investigative arrest.
There was no color of authority by these police
officers.

They

ment and they did so In an Intimidating and frightening
manner.

but that the Petitioner or that

the accused possessed that vreapon.

It is not as probative as

be applied more amply to physical evidence.
But I might add that in Wong Sun this Court held
and this Court stated that in view of deterrence and the
imperative of judicial integrity, the two underlying
rationales behind the exclusionary rule, there should be no

and physical evidence.
We do not here have a case where the statements

The police knew what they were after and they got

Those statements should be suppressed under Wong Sun

versus the United States.
QUESTION:

Mr. Isaacson, you said that you are not

contending for a "butfor" exclusionary rule?
I understood that — you did say that, did you
not?
MR. ISAACSON:
QUESTION:

Correct.

Then do I understand that what you are

contending for is for an exclusionary rule which will operate
to exclude oral or verbal statements depending upon — i.e.s
depending upon what, the gravity, the flagrancy or the
deliberate nature of the Fourth Amendment violation or the
combination of the three.
MR. ISAACSON:

Is that it?
Because all those circumstances

exist in the present case, your HOnor, yes.

The ease for

exclusion is the greatest in this particular case.
QUESTION:

Right.

But If It is not a "but for"

exclusionary rule, then it is a case-by-case exclusionary
rule, depending upon how flagrant, how grave and/or how
deliberate was the violation of the Fourth and 14th

48
Amendments?

Is that ifhat you are contending, sir?
MR. ISAACSON:

That is correct, your Honor.

This position is supported by the —■

MR. ISAACSON:

Nothing like that was done in the present case.
The AOI would have us point, and the model penal
code would suggest a rule of exclusion based upon the good
faith efforts of police officers.
They would have a rule of exclusion after an
4'

unconstitutional right of suppressing statements rendered.

49
That rule would be subject to a determination
of the good faith on the part of the police, the degree and
type of their activity, and that case — excuse me, the

case and we urge that your Honors —

Right, and this would be regardless

of the extent to which the police had flagrantly violated

MR. ISAACSON:

In that case, the connection between

attenuated.
If Petitioner was brought before a magistrate and

later returned.

But that is not the case at bar.

The case at bar was exploitation by the police and
they got the very product which they set out to get.

As

such, the case for exclusion is the strongest and this Court
should not sanction the investigative arrest.
If there are no further questions — thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you,

Mr. Isaacson.
Thank you, Miss Carr.
The case is submitted.
Mr. Isaacson, you appeared by appointment of
the Court, I believe and on behalf of the Court, I wish to
thank you for your assistance to the Court and, of course,
your assistance to your client.

was submitted.]
