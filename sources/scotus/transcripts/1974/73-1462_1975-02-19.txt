MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll hear arguments

next in 73-1462f White against Regester.
Mrs. Levatino3 you may proceed when you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. ELIZABETH LEVATINO,
OU BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

MRS» LEVATINO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and nay it

please the Court:
This is an appeal from an order issued by a threejudge federal court for the Western District of Texas, sitting
in Austin, which held the multi-member district scheme
embodied in the Texas Plan for Reapportionment unconstitu­
tional.
The State of Texas believes that the plaintiffs in.
this case have failed to produce evidence which meets their
burden of proof such as would warrant the suspension by a
federal court of multi-member districts, a policy consistently
utilized in -die Texas system of appropriation for its State
House of Representatives.
Tie are not here to debate or to defend the merits
of whether or not single-member districts should be used or
multi-member districts should be used.

But, rather, viewed

from the constitutional perspective set forth by this Court,
that is a decision which at this point should be left to the
Legislature.

Because the record in this case simply does not

4
support the proposition that multi“member districts have
resulted in a loss of access or in less opportunity of a
minority group to participate in the political processes
leading to nomination and election,, and therefore does not
support the action taken by the court below®
We are asking this Court to reverse the court below,
because that decision was based on incorrect constitutional
standards, evidence insufficient to support the correct
constitutional standards, as well as the erroneous standards
used, and the failure of the court to afford the Texas Legis­
lature the opportunity to exercise its proper function of
re apportionment.
The weakness of the plaintiffs’ case and the opinion
of the majority below,particularly in dealing with the
evidence before the court, is strikingly shown by the wellreasoned and exhaustive dissent of Judge Wood»
Judge Wood, as you may remember, only two years
before, clearly agreed with the other two members of the panel
that adequate and sufficient evidence was presented to the
court to invalidate the multi-member districts for Dallas and
Bexar Counties.
This Court has consistently and repeatedly insisted
that the challenger of multi-member districts produce evidence
which is sufficient to show that because of the multi-member
district members of the minority group within the district are

afforded less opportunity to participate in the political
processes leading to nomination and election, thereby
minimizing or cancelling out the voting strength of the racial
or political element within that district.
QUESTIONS

Counsel, what was the issue when this

case was remanded here? Was the only issue in this last phase
of the case the multi-member districts?
MRS. LEVATINO:
correct.

Basically, Your Honor, that is

It was -the multi-member districts throughout the

scheme, but —
QUESTION:

But they existed only in certain areas?

MRS„ LEVATINO: They exist -- there were eleven
remaining multi-member districts.

The plaintiffs intervened

— or plaintiffs
QUESTION:
given in each

But none of the — but if relief was

if all the multi-member districts were made

single-member districts, nothing would happen to all the other
districts in the State?
HRS. LEVATINO: That is correct. Your Honor, depending
on how the single-member districts were created.

Additionally,

the court below did find racial gerrymandering with regard to
Galveston, which would require an actual redistricting, not
on the basis of multi-menber/single-member districts, but a
changing of the scheme in that area, which could have a
dominant effect to affect the entire district scheme.

6
QUESTION:

'

Uell, why was this multi-member district

issue, since it affected only certain localities in the State,
why was it a three-judge court issue?
MRS. LEVATIHO:

Your Honor, I believe that one of

the major reasons that it is a three-judge court issue is
that this case attacks all of the remaining districts, which
is a Statewide policy, and as this Court has so recently held,
in Chapman vs» Heir, subject natter of this kind is regular
grasp for the three-judge court, and that typically has been
employed under conditions similar to those present here.
And of course this Court took jurisdiction in —
QUESTION:

If it had only concerned maybe one of

the multi-member districts out of several that might be
different?
MRS. LEVATIHO:

It may be different, Your Honor, but

I don't believe that the posture of this case is attacking
just one or just another.

It really is attacking the policy

decision of the Texas Legislature to utilize multi-member
districts at all.
These districts range from two members up to eight
— up to nine members,
QUESTION:

It's the whole policy,,
And all of the multi-member districts,

without exception, were under attack on this remand?
MRS. LEVATINO:

Yes, they were, Your Honor.

believe it •— I do not want to mislead the Court.

I

At trial,

plaintiffs conceded that the]? could not find evidence of
discrimination in one of the two-member districts, which was
Hidalgo County, and they changed the challenge in Galveston
County from a challenge to the multi-member district to the
racial gerrymandering challenge; although the pleadings
initially had challenged all of the multi-member districts
that remained in the county.
It is the lack of access or opportunity to partici­
pate in the political processes which must be shown; yet the
majority below saw fit to devise another new kind of test.
This test can't be supported by the opinions of this Court,
nor by basic logic,
neither can it be used to bootstrap a record which
would otherwise be insufficient to sustain holdings of
uncons ti.tutionality,
This new test consists of an aggregate of four
factors,. These factors are;
Restricted access of the minority to the slating
process of particular party nominations;
The consistent use of racist campaign tactics to
defeat minority candidates or those championing minority
concerns;
The indifference cr hostility of the district-wide
representatives to particularised needs of the minority; and
The inability of minority groups to obtain rep re senta*

3

tion in proportion to their percentage of the population in
•the districto
As set out in our brief, we believe these factors
operate primarily in a "get one, win three” manner, therefore
always adding up to an aggregate.
But beyond that I’d like to consider each factor
individually.
Beginning with this
QUESTION:

What kind of a manner?

HRS, LEVATINO:
manner.

You know, "get one, win three”

By -that I mean, Your Honor, if you lock at the three

factors, if you could find that there was no access to the
slating process —
QUESTION:

Then you'd get 'the other two along with

it?
MRS, LEVATlriO:

You automatically get the other two,

so it adds up to three, and thereby you win the game.
QUESTION:

I see.

But they're not distinct and

separate *
MRS. LEVATINO:

Independent — they are functions

of each otr er, b as ica 1 ly.
QUESTION: Right.

I understand.

MRS, LEVATINO: Beginning with the factor regarding
the election of a minority group in proportion to their
population of the district, I believe this factor has

9

previously been rejected by this Court in Whitconto, and more
recently in Chapman, as evidence of non-access.
Indeed;,the record in this case actually reflects
that in two of the districts, Nueces and El Paso, members of
the minority group have been consistently elected in the past
decade to the House of Representatives, as well as to other
district-wide government races.
In 'the 1963 and 1970 elections, Nueces sent a
delegation to the House which consisted of Representative
Truan, a Mexican American, Representative Hale, an honorary
member of the Mexican American group, and Sissy Farenthal,
widely known for her interest and concern for the minority
people„
In the latest election, a third district, Travis,
elected two members of two different minority groups to two
out of four seats. And that delegation is now composed of
its dean, Sarah Haddington, a 30-year-old woman? a. Mexican
American, Gonzalo Barrientos, who this time beat the then
17-year Anglo incumbent? Mrs. Delco, the black woman who the
majority characterised her election, early election to the
school board, as a distortion in the voting pattern? and
finally a 32-year-old male Anglo.
Now, no one can guarantee that this pattern will
continue.
continue

But then no one can guarantee that it won’t

10

At the very least it is and I believe should be
considered as strong evidence that minority groups do have
access to the political process.
Furthermore, while the plaintiffs in -the court below
were taking great pains to emphasize the relative failure of
the minorities at the ballot box since reconstruction, the
record also was reflecting that minority groups, both, leaders
and individuals endorsed and voted for non-minority candidates?
thereby electing many of these candidates and making them
legislators of their choice.
Proceeding to the next factor, Idle indifference or
hostility of the representatives to the particularized minority
interests, this, too, has never been referred to by this
Court —
QUESTION:

Well, counsel, just a — before you leave

this one factor.
Suppose there's a. ten-man multi-member district,
ten Representatives of a multi-member district, and at each
election one party slates three out of the ten as — slates
three Negroes out of the ten, which is roughly proportional
to the population, let's assume; and there's an opposing
slate from another party.
three Negroes are elected.

MRS» LEVATIHO:

this case, either.
QUESTION:

QUESTION:

Because arguably —- arguably that is

the situation in some of these; at least it's argued to be
the situation in some of them.
MRS. LEVATIHO:
QUESTION:

It is argued to be the situation.

Yes.

MRS. LEVATIHO:

Yes.

If we had the situation, first of all, that the

12
minority candidates were consistently slated, I believe that
is evidence of access.
QUESTION;

Yes.

MRS. LEVATINO: But I believe you also have to look to
why some of these candidates were not elected,,

I believe 'that,

as you well know, the function of election includes issues,
personalities, many things other than merely blacks only
voting for blacks and whites only voting for whites.
In the county I believe you're referring to, Mr,
Bobby Webber received 48 percent of the vote in that particular
multi-member district, the Tarrant County District.
Uov?, that certainly shows that he got more than just
the black votes in that ares.
I think that would be a very close question, but
I do not

I think that the question is that close in these

districts, as the hypothetical which you presented.
With regard to the ability to represent -the minority,
this also has been rejected as significant or has never been
affirmatively said to be significant in evaluating the
particular access to the political process.
But the Court

even if it were relevant, the Court

below didn’t really apply this factor.

They applied their

own factor which required some kind of affirmative legislative
action on behalf of all the members of the delegation.

The

reason for this change was that the record generally reflected

13

non-hostile or even sympathetic voting records.

In some

districts clear concessions of excellent voting records.
And certainly sympathy for the needs of the minority.
In one county -the majority went even further from
its pronounced test, by finding that a delegate was deficient
because he could not empathize with the minority, even if he
could sympathize with it.
This is only one more example of the weakness of the
plaintiffs' case, and the obvious attempt by the majority to
provide that which the plaintiffs did not.
The third factor, of course, is the consistent use
of racist campaign tactics, a policy or a strategy which we
all deplore; but again which this Court has never related
specifically to the issue of access.
The mention of it in declaring Dallas County multimember district unconstitutional included the inference that
such tactics must be successful.

An element now discarded

by th e maj ori ty „
Additionally, as pointed out by Judge TIood, idle few
cited instance of the use of such tactics, a whisper campaign
in El Paso for the Mayor's race, or a School Board race,
in the Fifties and Sixties in llueces County.

This kind of

evidence hardly rises to the level of consistent, and
certainly not to the level of proof required in a case of
this nature.

as

14
QUESTION: Well, do you concade that a court may
appropriately take into account what they label,, for purposes
of this case,

racist campaign tactics?

MRS. LEVATINO;

I believe 'that they could take it

into account, Your Honor, but I do not believe it could be
one in a factor, in a checklist of factors, the way these are
set up? but would

especially if they had not been successful,

as the record generally shows, that it would rise to the leve
of proof which this Court has required.
QUESTION: For what purpose could the district court
take it into account?
MRS. LEVATINO:

I believe the reason it could be

taken into account would be to show that black or brown
minority candidates could never be elected, or that their
election was totally impossible in especially a large district.
This is not reflected in this record, however.
QUESTION:

This position doesn’t give you any

trouble with the First Amendment?

Doesn’t the First Amendment

guarantee candidates the right even to engage in what everyone
would condemn, in terms of decent campaigning, but doesn't the
First Amendment guarantee them the right to say what they
want to say in a campaign?
MRS. LEVATINO:

I believe tliat everyone can say what

they want to say in a campaign, Your Honor.
QUESTION: Couldn’t a Negro candidate go out and

15

campaign,directly attack:!nr whites as whites, and couldn’t a
Mexican American do the same thing, or a white?
MRS. LEVATINO:

I believe he would have the

possibility of doing that, Your Honor.
QUESTIO!!: Then are you saying that a court may take
into account conduct which is protected by the First Amend­
ment to

in this formula?
MRS. LEVATINO:
QUESTION;

As the court obviously did here,

Take into account conduct which is —

Took into account what are labeled in

this case as racist campaign tactics„
MRS. LEVATINO;

Your Honor, I do believe that the

court can take this into account, but, as I said, the way this
Court used a checklist factor, the youth of these candidates,
in adding it all up independent — supposedly independent of
each other, the factors didn't work that way.
And additionally, the racist campaign tactics cited
by the Court, as pointed out by Judge Mood, were not,
certainly not consistent

and in most of the instances were

not s uccessful.
So what *— its relevance to the access in this case,
I believe is not sufficient to sustain a finding of
unconstitutionality,
QUESTION; Well, certainly the meaning of a democratic
government, I would think, is that when I go into tie ballot
box and vote for a candidate, I can vote for him for a good

16

reason, a bad reason, or for no reason at all»

If I want to

vote against a man because he's black, if I want to vote for
him because he's black or whits or brown, but that's my
privilege as a citizen, I would think,
MRS, LEVATIHO:

Yes, sir.

And I don't — I do not

pretend to say that you can't vote for any person for any
reason.
QUESTION: But •■the question is whether — whether
consistently — consistent voting discrimination against any
kind of a minority is enough of a reason to disestablish a
multi-"member district»
MRS. LEVATINO:

That's the question»
Ho, Your Honor, I do not believe,

on its own grounds, that is enough of a reason» This Court
has said you have to show denial of the opportunity to
participate.
The fact that a racist campaign tactic is used does
not say that the minority group in question is not partici­
pating in it.

It may be noted, it may go into the totality

of circumstances; but in and of itself it is not a grounds
for declaring a multi-member district unconstitutional»
The final factor is the restricted access of the
minority to the slating of candidates for party nominations.
This, we believe, is a valid factor, and. we believe
it's the only one which this Court has heretofore approved
and set out as something that should be shown, in fact must

17
be shown.
However# it should be pointed out that while Texas
much has been made of the fact that Texas is a one-party
State»

The primary elections and activity prior to the primary

election reflect just as intense political battles between
conservatives# liberals# business labor# as is reflected
between the major parties in any other States. And I believe
you must view the slating procedure in that nature»
The record reflects that in one two counties #
Tarrant and Jefferson, are there any cognizable formalized
groups which consistently endorse candidates.

Minorities have

received that endorsement in both, counties „
This is a far cry from the situation found by this
Court to exist in Round One of this particular case# where
virtually complete control over the candidates and political
processes in Dallas County was exercised by the Dallas
Citizens for a Responsible Government; the DCRG»
Additionally, in this case# the record shows that
endorsement of any one group, in any one district, is not
tantamount to election»
However convenient this checklist approach of the
majority may be# it cannot be supported by the record nor by
the constitutional standards set out by this Court,
This Court# in fact, has never utilized a checklist,
and inferentially rejected its use in Whitcomb# as the dissent

of Justice Douglas showed. All of the factors which were
previously set out in Burns vs. Richardson were existing in
the Whitcomb, Indiana, district, and yet it was upheld as
constitutional.
Furthermore, the districts in question are smaller
than any heretofore invalidated by this Court. These districts
range in size from one electing only six percent of the Texas
House of Representatives down to ones electing barely one
percent or two out of 150 members of the Texas Legislature.
This simply is not a case involved extremely large
districts electing a high percentage of Legislative Representa
tives.
The State of Texas believes that whether or not
single-member districts are desirable in any of these district
and,if so, the specific design of the districts are political
questions at this point and are not constitutionally required.
The Texas Legislature does not act in the area of
reapportionment only when pushed and pulled by a federal court
although their actions may be subsequently challenged? and
at least in this decade we’re two-for-two on that score.
In fact, the Legislature meeting in regular session
right now, for the first time since this Court issued its
opinion in Round One of White vs. Regester, is today, this
Wednesday, conducting a hearing on two single-member district
bills for Tarrant County.

Single-member district bills have

19
also been introduced for other counties, and are being drafted
for idie remainder»
On the basis of the record in this case, on the
erroneous constitutional standards used by the majority, and
on the failure of the court below to afford the Texas
Legislature its rightful opportunity to reapportion, we ask
that the decision of the district court be reversed.
Thank you»

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID RICHARDS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES REGESTER, ET AL,,
MORENO, ET AL., CHAPMAN, ET AL., WRIGHT,
ET AL., AND WARREN, ET AL.
MR. RICHARDS

5

Hr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case involved, on remand, the challenge of nine
multi~member districts existing in the State,* as it now stands,
seven of those districts were invalidated under the principles
of Regester, and are here before the Court.
Mr. Gladden, with whom I’m sharing time, is going to
discuss the Tarrent County District; I'm going to attempt to
discuss the balance.
From 1900 to 1966, no Negro citizen of Texas was a
nominee of either the Republican or Democratic Party for any
public office in Texas, any elective office.

20
It was not. until 1966 that, a Negro for the first time
was elected to the Texas Legislature.

One of those is now

serving in Congress, and that's Congresswoman Barbara Jordan*
When I came up yesterday on the airplane I picked
up the current Atlantic Monthly — to go outside the record
for a moment — which was devoted this month to Texas,
there was an article by Miss Jordan in it.

And

And she says what

I think is quite accurate.
Until this Court decided to get into apportionment,
there was no chance in Texas or in the South for blacks to be
elected to office.

It was only when Harris County, as a

consequence of this Court's decision requiring one-men/one-^vote
in both Houses of the Legislature, required radistrieting in
Harris County that she had an opportunity to be elected to
office.
And, frankly, that situation remained unchanged until
this Court decided Reges ter last term.
With the advent of Reges ter and the effect of single­
member districts in Dallas, Bexar, and

Harris County now,

there has been a dramatic increase in both black and Mexican
American representation in the Texas Legislature; and, as we
see it, it solely is attributable to this Court's involvement
in reapportionment litigation.
And we would hate at this point to see a retreat,
very frankly.

21
The contrast with Mhitcomb is just that, which 1
think Justice White alluded to, in Whit corah, the Court
characterized a typical legislative race as a head-to-head
race between two opposing partiesj with — in Marion County,
Indiana, if the Democrats won, typically the ghetto would have
adequate representation, if I recall the language.
That's simply not the case in Texas.

Texas is a

one-party State, which we have a majority place system, all
races are determined in the Primary, and what it results in
is a head-to-head race with a minority candidate pitted
against an Anglo candidate, and the result has been, almost
without exception, defeat for the minority candidate,
Texas is peculiar in several regards,, and this is
a special system? but the result has been clear, it's been
virtual exclusion for minority elections.
We have today what we think to be just simply the
sequel to both the Bexar and Dallas cases.
In some cases it seems to me, in some of the counties,
the evidence is stronger than it was with respect to Bexar
or even in Dallas; that is, with respect to some of the
counties before the Court,
The record is, at this point, something like 14
printed volumes.

The original seven volumes of the Regester

case, together with, I think, an additional six printed
vo1umes today.

22
For example, we would suggest, that the plight of
the blacks in most of these counties is significantly worse
than it was for the blacks in Dallas County, because at least
in Dallas there was sort of a white man's burden assumed that
they would occasionally slate a black* put him on the ticket*
have him elected.
In Jefferson County* for example* that's never been th
case* and it looks to me as if it never will be the case..
There the testimony is that politics in that county have been
dominated by COPE* the arm of Texas AFL-CIO* and that slating
by COPE -was tantamount to election.

That's Beaumont, Port Arthur are the

are

Why can’t you slate us? Why can't

you make us one of the recommended candidates?
Hie leadership's response was s

We’re afraid of

rank-and-file pressures, hostility toward blacks; if we put
you on the ticket and endorse you, we might not be reelected
to our offices.
Now, that’s pretty strong stuff.

And that’s exactly

the situation that prevails today.
In McLennan County, where I grew up, the State's

QUESTION; Waco.
MR. RICHARDS:

QUESTION:

Unh~hunh.

MR. RICHARDS;

In Bexar County we heard — you

heard Bexar County before, there was evidence of reasonable
access to — reasonable success, in some instances, of Mexican
American candidates.
The success of Mexican American candidates, in the
counties that, we’re looking at today, El Paso, Nueces and
Lubbock, is dramatically less than it was in Bexar County.
And, unlike Bexar County, where there was no sugges­
tion of racial campaign tactics ever being utilised.

There is

evidence that they were regularly utilised in these other
counties to defeat Mexican American candidates.
Granted, there may be a First Amendment right to
utilize racial campaign tactics, but our concern is:

How does

a multi-member district operate on minority access and it's
our view that this is a relevant consideration, that this, in
fact, fore-ordained lack of success

by the minority candidate.

Although we’re dealing with six counties, and they
are each different and each, I suppose, had a particularized
appraisal by the trial court, there are some similarities.
At the time of trial no black had ever been a
nominee for the Democratic Primary for any office in any of
those counties.
The one pattern that emerged in at least three of

25
the places we looked at was the recurrence of a certain
theme? that is,, when minority candidates threatened success
at the polls.» the game was changed.

In Waco, the first time

a black candidate ever ran for City Council, at that point
Waco had a ward system, essentially a single-member district
system,
The black candidate ran»

The next time around 'they

changed the rules, went back to an at-large election, voted
on by the entire electorate.
In Travis County also, the same pattern emerged.
The first City Council candidate, black, Arthur DeWitte ran
for City Council and ran a good race.

What did they do?

They changed the rules? went from a plurality to a majority
system the next time around.
In Huecss County, the first time the Mexican
American candidates there, seriously threatened the School
Board elections, they

moved from a plurality to a majority

system.
And what we're really saying, I think, in part, is
that this at-large, majority, place system links up in a very
realy way to deny access to minority candidates»
And I think that's precisely what the court found
the first time. That's what this Court found when it affirmed
unanimously Regesfeer, and we think it’s the same case again.
To the extent, at one stage, the defense suggests

that part of our burden is to prove that these districts were
designed to disenfranchise minority candidates, I take it that
means that we must show an unlawful motive.

We do not think

that's the proper equal protection test, but to the extent
that that's the test, or to the extent that that's our burden,
the evidence is here just as it was before; that is, it's the
same record, it's the same people acting, it's the same action
of the Legislative Redistricting Board that created the
districts that are now beofre the Court that were here before*
It. seems to me, at least, that one thing comes
through quite clearly;

the Texas Supreme Court said in Mauzy

vs. Redistricting JBoard that the Legislative Redistricting
Board in structuring these districts should consider carefully
whether any

multi-member district might result in discrimina­

tion against minority candidates.
And yet the testimony is quite clear that the
Legislative Redistricting Board totally ignored this question,
and indeed one member of the Board characterized the appearance
find testimony of the minority candidates with an epithet, a
profans epithet, and characterized it as being ignored
entirely.
So, I suppose, that one can assume that they intended
the logical consequences of their act? they did not undertake
to consider the impact upon minorities, and in so doing, it
seems to us, supplied the necessary motive, if in fact it was a

27

requi rement.
I have one or two asides about how deeply imbedded
the State policy is v,Tith respect to multi-member districts»
There is one oddity in this case, to me:

that is with respect

to McLennan Comity, one of the smallest ones involved.
When the Legislature redistricted McLennan County
in 1971, it created two single-member districts in McLennan
County.
When the Legislative Redistricting Board came about
this task, they reconstituted that county in a multi-member
district„
QUESTION:

What has been the history of McLennan

before 1971, as to number of districts?
MR. RICHARDS:

It had been a multi-member district

before 1970 — or at least in terms of when its population
justified it; and it had been a multi-member district for
some time.

In 19-- —
QUESTION:

It was two, wasn’t it?

MR, RICHARDS:

With two at one point, yes, sir,

One, years ago, that was larger and had a territorial
representative, too, as I recall.
In any event, when the Legislature came to deal with
it in 1370, after the Census, for the first time the Legis­
lature cut it into two single-member districts; and then it
was the Legislative Redistricting Board, after they were im-

pelied to act, that they reconstituted the multi-member
district.
And it was almost the same seesaw, too, because the
Legislature did not create single-member districts in Harris
County, it created districts of

three districts in which

representatives ran, I think, six in one and seven in another?
and it. was the Legislative Redistricting Board that constituted
single-member districts there.
So from the top and the bottom of tits spectrum, you
would have sort of wavering policies, as we view it*
Finally, it seems to us that one question that .is
in the case that I want to speak a moment to, and that's the
matter of remedy.
The State argues, and I guess by virtue of the State
it was granted here, there must be maybe some concern because
the Court implemented its own plans or the plaintiffs' plans
for the single-member districts.
We think under the circumstances it was entirely
proper.
As the record reflects, the trial court ordered the
State — it didn't order the State? requested the State to
produce any proposed redistricting plans it had by January 18th,
1974,

The State produced no plans by that date.
The court then scheduled a hearing for January 28th,

at which time the question of what remedy was going to be

29
applied.

At that point the State did appear and adopt certain

plans.
nut with respect to the six counties that we're:
concerned with, I would like to point out that with respect to
McLennan County and Travis County and El Paso County the
State offered no plan in opposition to the plan offered by
the plaintiffs, in effect, acquiesced in it.
In llueces County,, the State, in effect, adopted
two plans; said either one was satisfactory.

One of those

plans being the plan proffered by the plaintiffs.
Only in Lubbock and Jefferson Counties did the State
offer plans in opposition

to those proposed by the plaintiffs»

And in both instances, the State plan was less faithful to the
State policy than the plaintiffs' plan.

Because in each

instance the State plan would have required redrawing
adjoining single-member districts.

Thus, in Jefferson County

they would have restructured not. only the multi-member district
but altered single-member districts there were abating it on
either side, which was not even in issue.
The same pattern emerged in Lubbock County, where
they sponsored a plan, the State's plan would have required
not only to create a single-member district but alteration of
adjoining single-member districts.
So we would suggest the court, trial court, in
adopting our proposals was more faithful to this Court's

30
decision in Vie is or vs., White, that is, because the plans

we

sponsored were faithful to the State policy, did not in fact
intrude upon the adjoining districts, and for that reason, too,
it was abuse of discretion»
Further, the plan sponsored by the State in Jefferson
County, assuming that the concern of the case was to
enfranchise or disenfranchise Negro minority of that city,
of that district, the State’s plan would have drawn the Negro
population of Jefferson County into four nice slices;
percent in each of the four districts»

twenty

IJhich would be, it

seems to me, .to worsen the situation, where now they
constitute

thirty percent of the multi-member district?

under the State's proposal they would have been reduced down
to roughly 20 to 25 percent in each of the four proposed
single-member districts»
He do not -- it is our view that the record, as I
say, is exactly the record that we presented to this Court in
the first round.

All of the same references here, we have

gone back and dens exactly what we did the first time around;
developed evidence on a local basis, how the multi-member
district operated in fact in those counties upon the minority
of those counties.
In two counties, where the proof simply didn't
sustain itself, one in Hidalgo, we all conceded that the
multi-member district there could not be demonstrated to

31
deprive the minority of that county of access.
The same was true in Galveston County , where again
a particularized local appraisal led us, everyone to the
conclusion that the multi-member district there did not in
fact deny access.
In Galveston County, the trial court — I'm sorry?
QUESTIONs

Hr, Richards, you're speaking about,

evidence in these, counties.

Would you take a look at El Paso

and tell me how, with sixty percent of the voters, —
HR. RICHARDS;

I can tell you some of it, yes,

Your Honor.
QUESTION;

— minority citizens, it can be said that

the members of the Legislature from El Paso were not respon­
sive to the needs of sixty percent of the people whom they
represent?
MR. RICHARDS;

Well, first, let me point out — or

let me at least point out first that the fact that there was
perhaps a numerical majority, it was

also the argument made

by the State with respect to Bexar County in fee initial case*
The fact is, however, that in El Paso County,
whereas there was a numerical majority, there was 38 percent
of the registered voters were Mexican American, and participa­
tion figures were even lower than that*
And I think what the court was saying in El Paso
County was the same thing the court said in respect to Bexar

32
County.

That taken together with historical factors,, including

the poll tax and till the things that have served to diminish
Mexical American participation in Texas, operated very frankly
in El Paso County with a great deal more force than it did in
Bexar County.
I don't like to gat into numbers, but the numbers,
frankly, are that *— as my good friend, Judge Cobaugh says,
since reconstruction there have been at least five Mexican
Americans elected to the Legislature from Rexar County, and
from El Paso only four?

At the time the case was tried,

not a single member of the El Paso Delegation in the Legis­
lature was Mexican American.

I think

QUESTION; What evidence is there that the members
of the Legislature were unresponsive to a majority of the
population?
MR, RICHARDS;
QUESTION:

Well, I --

Is there evidence in the record?

MR. RICHARDS;

1 would not argue as to the current

delegation of the Legislature, I do not tit ink that there is
evidence that supported that particular finding.

There

certainly is evidence in a finding that historically there
had been unresponsiveness. - In fact, one of 'the persons who
testified was a former Senator there, and he testified that
he had proposed an abolition of the poll tax, which the trial
court, I think, quite properly found to be evidence of

33

unresponsiveness in light of the history of the poll tax, as
it fell upon Mexican Americans and blacks in Texas.
QUESTION:

Well, why shouldn't the district court

pay attention to the actual current situation when it makes its
judgment?

If at the time it decides there are representatives

of the minority being slated and elected in a district, should
the district court nevertheless say that historically this
hasn’t been so, and therefore we're going to disestablish
the multi-member district?
MR. RICHARDS;

Well, I think it could

I think it should pay attention, and I
attention.

excuse me,

think it did pay

I'm saying here that in El Paso County, for

example, at the time this case was tried, no Mexican American
served in the — none of the four-member delegation or fivemember delegation actually from El Paso had served in the
Texas Legislature.

And that was part of the facts of that

case.
QUES TI ON s

Unh -h unh.

MR. RICHARDS;

In Nueces County, when the facts —

QUESTION: What about, at tine time of the court's
opinion? is that true?
MR. RICHARDS:

Yes, the district — I'm sorry, that

is the fact, at the time of the court's opinion.

There were

only, as I say, four — four in the history, in a county that
constitutes a numerical majority. And I don't mean to suggest

34
that this is purely a numbers game.
The testimony in El Paso County is, from a former
Democratic County Chairman,, that there was sufficient -QUESTION:

Welly what if between decision and

appeal the fact situation changes dramatically?
MR, RICHARDS:

Well, all right,

I don't know that

they have changed dramatically •— well,-the facts
QUESTION: Welly let's assume that they did, what
would you suggest that the appellate court should do?
MR, RICHARDS: Welly I suppose the facts could change
to moot the case, the facts could change so dramatically that
it might require a reconsideration,
I would suggest that there has been no such dramatic
change in Texas.

There is now Representative Raul Moreno who

has been elected from El Paso, so there now sits one Mexican
American in the El Paso Delegation,
But

and Bobby Webber lost again in Fort Worth;

Al Price lost again in Jefferson County*

I mean, we can go

either way, that the black candidates that we were proving
about, and they say well if they just try again it will be
better; they tried again and they lost.

So, I mean, it really

cuts both, ways.
We suggest that there has not been a significant
change in the picture in Texas, with the possible exception
of Travis County, which is a very specialised breed of cat.

35

and, as Mrs. Levatino points out, there has been a change
there? more attributable, I think, to the 18-year-old vote
than to any diminishing of prejudice on the part of the
electorate.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Richards.

Mr. Gladden,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DON GLADDEN, ESO. ,
ON BEIIALF OF APPELLEES ESCALANTE, ET AL,
MR. GLADDEN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
I will be discussing Tarrant County, which the
primary city in Tarrant County is Fort Worth? we're adjacent
immediately to the east of Dallas County, and I feel sort of
that what's good for Dallas County perhaps is good for Tarrant
County,

And that we would like to participate and share

their benefits of this Court's action relative to multi­
member districts,
QUESTION; Before you get on with that, let me ask
you this:

If a particular district, with sixty percent

representation of a minority, or any other group, consistently
elects a non-minority group, what inferences are to be
drawn from that?
MR. GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

If a sixty percent -Minority consistently elects someone

36

not in the minority group ■—
MR. GLADDEN;

I don't understand the Courtf I'm

sorry, about the sixty percent minority.

In minorities

QUESTION: Well, suppose the district is sixty percent
combined Mexican Americans and Negroes.
MR. GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

Black, oh, I see.

Okay.

But they consistently elect whites, what

argument is to be made of that?
MR» GLADDEN:

I don't think that situation exists

in Texas, unless it perhaps exists in Hidalgo County, where
there is a substantial Mexican American, in essence a majority?
and they elect both whites and Mexican Americans»
In Tarrant County we've got a situation which, unlike
Mrs. Levatino suggested, is not a small district*
population of 675,000.

It has a

Some 60,000 more than the State of

North Dakota, that this Court considered in the Chapman case»
.-itLbV'-.-v—jv-51

It has nine members that are all elected at large.
If has 82 percent white, or about 550,000? it has 12 percent
black, or about 80,000; and 6 percent Chicano or Mexican
American, or about 40,000 population.
No blacks have ever been elected from Tarrant
County to the Texas Legislature.
Now, I'd like to qualify the words "Tarrant County"
and r'District 32", because actually I'm talking about District
32 here.

37
Prior to 1972 , Tarrant County was a. single-member
district.

As of 1972, the Legislative Redistricting Board

trimmed -the excess population from the rural areas of Tarrant
County and put them in an adjoining district as to as to
reduce it to a nine-member district.
QUESTION:

The elections there, are they by Party?

MR, GLADDEN;
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor,, they ~
So it's a one-party operation, but it’s

just a head-to-head race, is it?
MR. GLADDEN;

We have a Primary system in Texas.

A nomination in the Democratic Party in Tarrant County is
tantamount to election in Tarrant County.

No Republican —

just as Blacks and Chicanos, there has never been a Republican
elected in Tarrant County or in District 32.
QUESTION;

How difficult is it to get on the Primary

ballot?
MR. GLADDEN;
the Primary ballot.

It is not difficult at all t.o get on

We have $100

we used to have $100

filing fee, I guess no filing fee now, thanks to this Court.
QUESTION;

How many signatures are required?

MR, GLADDEN;

None.

You can just go in and sign

up and get on the ballot? but I think —
QUESTION; Do you have to sign up for a place in your
county?
MR. GLADDEN;

Yes, you do have.

It is a place

30
system»
QUESTION;

You have to pick your opponent»

MR. GLADDEN ;

This is a place system.

Or your

opponent picks you.
We have not only a place system, and this again
QUESTION;

But you’re not going to get picked unless

you're in.
MR. GLADDEN;

That's very true.

flay I suggest to the Court, first of all, an error
in our brief.

On page 46 we cited Whitcomb for the proposition

that there were sub”districts within Marion County.
I apologize, that is not true.

And

There are no sub-districts in

Tarrant County or in District 32, to require a person to live
in any geographical area.
We do have a placing system, where you've got to
pick place one, place two, places three, place four, place
five, so on through to nine.

The numbers of people who pick

a particular place depends upon, first of all, the confusion
of the circumstances, and the fellow that you want to run
against,
QUESTION; So you say that — you must say, then,
that there's complete access to the ballot.
MR. GLADDEN;

I don't think there’s any question

but. what blacks, even —>
QUESTION; And slating — slating is beside the point

39
as far as access to the ballot is concerned,,
MR. GLADDENS
QUESTION:

No, no, slating is not —

It. nay not be beside the point as to

who wins*
MR, GLADDEN;

Slating is of concern only on who wins,

not as to access of the ballot*
QUESTION;

So there's complete access to the ballot.

MR» GLADDEN;

Ho question about it.

Any black

or any Chica.no that has •—
QUESTION; So you say that it really is a function
of discriminatory voting that has kept blacks off the —
MR. GLADDEN;

No, I do not. Your Honor,

it is an action of discriminating slating.

I say -chat

There are

slating procedures —•
QUESTION: Well, I know, but if all a Negro has to
do is to go ahead and pay his hundred dollars, he's on the
ballot.
MR. GLADDEN:

Okay.

But the evidence is that

there are slating pre™Primary slating procedures, -there is
a Downtown Seventh Street Business Group that, slates
candidates.
QUESTION;

Well, I know, but it nevertheless --

whatever the results are, they are —• they can’t keep
Negroes off the ballot.
MR. GLADDEN:

That's very true*

40

QUESTIONS All they can do is just —
MR. GLADDEN;
QUESTIONs

Just keep then -*»
— organize the vote.

MR. GLADDEN;

All they can do is just keep them

from winning, Your Honor.
QUESTION: Well, that's what I mean.

Then, so the

discrimination is a function of the results of the polls.
MR. GLADDEN:

Yes, there’s no question about that,

that practice.
QUESTION: And you’re suggesting that consistent
discrimination at the polls against blacks v/ho are running
for office, a systematic discrimination against them, is a
sufficient reason for disestablishing a multi-member
district?
MR. GLADDEN:

Taking into consideration all the

other factors —
QUESTION;

Which wasn’t the issue at all. in Whitcomb.

MR. GLADDEN;

No, it wasn’t the issue in Whitcomb.

What I'm saying is, in this instance, that slating
processes go on, that in order far a person — that the
evidence in this case is that in order for a person to have a
raeanin'ful opportunity to be elected, he must have been slated
either by the Labor Liberal slate —■
QUESTION:
MR. GLADDEN;

Or by the Seventh Street group.
— or by the Seventh Street group.

41
QUESTIONs

Or get

MR. GLADDEN;

enough votes at the polls.

Well, the evidence is that you don't

get enough votes, and the State’s witnesses, when called upon
to cite one example of one Legislator who had been elected
from Tarrant County that did not have either one, the
business community on the one hand, or the Labor Liberal
community support slating on the other hand, and Representative
Gib Lewis thought and thought and thought and could not come
up with one single member of the Legislature

in the history

he had been aware of.
So it doesn’t get you elected to be slated by the
labor people, it doesn't get you elected to be slated by the
business group? but you can't make it without being slated by
one of them
QUESTIONs

That's a little bit like the situation

would be in many States, you have to be supported by the
Republicans or by the Democrats.
MR. GLADDEN;

That's very true? that's very true,,

If 1 may go ahead and. talk about —
QUESTION:

In order to realistically have a chance

to be reelected,
MR. GLADDEN;

Yes.

And again, from a meaningful

opportunity of getting your name on the ballot and a meaning­
ful opportunity to be endorsed and elected is the question..
No black has ever been elected, and if I may show --

42
QUESTION:

Were blacks aver slated?

MR. GLADDEN:

Blacks were slated twice.

QUESTION: Were they elected?
MR. GLADDEN:

No, sir. No, Your Honor,

in 1960, the first black ran in 1963.

The first

In i960 the white

community voted 75 percent for -tine white candidate, 25 percent
for the black.

The black community voted 89 percent for the

black candidate and 11 percent for the white candidate.

And

he lost.
In 1972, ~
QUESTION; So I guess the fellow from the other slate
won ?
MR. GLADDEN:
slate won.

Yes, the fellow from the business

The black was slated by the Liberal community.
QUESTION:

It would be interesting if both slating

organisations slated a black sometime,
MR, GLADDEN:

It sura would, but the business slate

has never slated a black.
In 1972, the — a. black was slated by the labor
group, and he ran a very respectable race.

He spent $25,000

of his own money, and drawing only 1400 or so from the black
community,

lie was a prominent businessman.

He ran a no­

distinguishing type campaign and did not make disclosures that
he was black,

And in the circumstance cited again in the

Chapman case, with a confused nine-place system, the community

43
probably didn't know about Mr. Webber being black, they knew
about the. fact that he was a prominent businessman, and he
again picked up 25 percent of the white community; but lost
75 percent. And about 85 percent, of the black community. And
he
QUESTION:

Is this any different than if you had,

instead of the Seventh Street Group and the Liberal Labor
quota, the Republican and Democratic Parties, and your argument
was that neither one is ever
MR. GLADDEN;

has ever chosen a Negro?

In essence, yes.

And it's also the

same circumstance that Justice White raised about the fact
that if you do slate a black, does

he ever win?

And the answer is, no, he never wins? he never has
won, and Bobby Webber, the black who ran in 1972 and came
close, the State made issue at the trial of the case, saying,
Well, boy, you kno\-/ old Bobby just ran so close with his
$25,000, don't you think he's going to win next time?
He dropped to 43 percent, because it was suggested
in the trial of this case that, it was because there was a
greater familiarity with
QUESTION:

But I don't think you've answered my

crass tion.
MR. GLADDEN;

Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Justice; would

you repeat the question?
QUESTION; Well, I won’t repeat it, I'll ask you

44
another one.
MR. GLADDEI'is
QUESTION:

All right.

Is your argument basically that in a

system where you have open access to the ballot,, as you
apparently do in Fort Worth

,

that if the two major political

factions don't nominat Negroes, ‘the federal court has to step
in and do something about the districting?
MR. GLADDEN:

I think that if in Fort Worth,, if in a.

multi-member district, where you see a submergence of a
minority interest, that does not have access to the slating
process,yes, I feel like —
QUESTION: Well, you wouldn't say the same thing if
the multi-member district were disestablished and the same
thing occurred within the single-member districts?

You

wouldn' t say that?
You say it couldn't happen because of the majority
— because the so-called minority would be a minority in some
districts; but it could happen?
MR. GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

I would say it was —

Apathy could make it happen even in

single-member districts, and then you wouldn't have much
to complain

about.

MR. GLADDEN;

Yes, I would — I would say that

QUESTION: Well, I doubt if you could win,
MR. GLADDEN:

I would say if it Was done with ■

intent to dilute the minority strength, that it would.
QUESTIONS

Well, dilute

intent to dilute,

like if somebody intends to beat a Negro by the vote at the
polls, you're not going to upset that very easily.
MR. GLADDENs Well, this is very true.
Now, then, if I may -QUESTION;

Mr» Gladden, before you leave this

point —
MR. GLADDEN;
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.

— has a Republican ever been slated in

Fort Worth?
MR. GLADDEN;

Not. to mv knowledge by the business

group or the labor group.
QUESTION; But you said there had never been one
elected.
MR. GLADDENs

Well, there have never been any

serious challenges in House races.

There is presently in the

southern part of the county a senatorial district that a
Republican presently holds.

But there's never been one

County Legislator, countywide.
QUESTION; Are Republicans a party to this litigation
MR. GLADDEN:

Republicans were parties plaintiff

to this litigation —
QUESTION;

Are they still in the case?

MR. GLADDEN;

Yes, they filed claims, and —

46

QUESTION:

Which counsel represents them?

MR. GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

Mr.

—

It's hard to tell, isn’t it?

[Laughter]
MR. GLADDEN:
EOkay,

Some doubt as to that.
Okay.

Mr. Jim George of Austin, Texas

Your Honor, represented Idle Republican Party.
QUESTION; And so you are making the same claim of
discrimination against Republicans that you are against
minorities?
MR. GLADDEN;

The Republicans made that same claim

Your Honor.
QUESTION: Well, are you making it?
MR. GLADDEN:
QUESTION;

We carry it forward, yes.

You are making it?

MR. GLADDEN:

I think so.

We feel -

You are making it?

I think that political

philosophy and economics also was an issue in our case, of
economic discrimination.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Do you have anything further, Mrs. Levatino?

47

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. ELIZABETH R. LEVATINO,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MRS. LEVATIMO:

Yes, Your Honor, I would like to

make just a few very short and brief comments.
First of all, to answer the question which you
posed to Mr. Gladden, Mr, Chief Justice ~~ in other words,
what would be the comment on a minority, high minority
inhabited district which consistently elects a non-minority
person.

I think that the inference from that must be that

they like the people that they represent, and those nonminority members do represent their interests well.
I think, with regard to Tarrant County, it must be.
remembered that blacks are part of these coalitions, that
blacks have backed Anglo people who have also won, and that
the Labor Liberal coalition needs the black votes and searches
for them.
This is not the case of the DCRG, as you saw in
Dallas County two years ago.
Mr. Richards mentioned that according to Barbara
Jordan the change in the Texas -- the racial makeup of the
Texas Legislature was solely attributable to reapportionment,
I would like this Court

I would like to point out to this

Court that we now have permanent voting registration in this
— in our State, which was not the case when this first round
of Reges».ter was fir heard.
. riM» Zr.'r

.1

,r. »" ■

The voting rolls have risen from

3.8 million to 5»2 million since 1971»
Additionallyf the poll tax has now been gone since
app roximate ly 19 66«,
The filing fees have been abolished, basically are
brought down very low, either $150 or one percent of the people
voting in the prior race, not

to exceed 5,000 signatures.

The access to voting has certainly improved
dramatically.

We have roving — deputy registrars for voting,

you can register to vote by mail, and your registration is
automatically renewed if you vote once every three years.
I submit that- these are some of the reasons that
there also has been a dramatic change in Texas,
Additionally, the statement was made that in
Jefferson County, COPE, the political arm of AFL-CIO, never
endorsed a minority.

I would, submit that the record reflects

that Mr, Price was endorsed as an acceptable candidate in
1972.

Fie then received 48 percent of the vote.
And also an endorsement by COPE was not tantamount

to election, as the record reflects, both Representatives
Powers and Doyle, who ware in that Delegation at the time of
the trial of this case, were elected without that endorsement.
With regard to McLennan and Travis Counties going
from Ward City Council politics to the at-large election, I
would like to point out that those at-large elections have
resulted in two blacks being elected to the McLennan City

Council it and one black being elected twice to the Aus tin
or -*• Austin# which is the major city in Travis County# Council,
Again I do not want to get into plans in the various
presentation of the plains, I only want to

say that while

the State never acquiesced by not presenting plans# we
maintained throughout the trial that the court# if it found
any districts unconstitutional# should allow the
Legislature to reapportion,
opportunity under court

It had never been given that

order*

Additionally# with regal'd to the plan presented in
Jefferson County# as was stated here earlier# Jefferson Comity
is composed of Beaumont and Port Arthur? the plan which was
submitted# as agreed to by the members of the Delegation from
Jefferson County# would have made Beaumont one district#
the mid-county area one district# and

Port Arthur one district#

However# admittedly# splitting up the black votes —
however# previous plans started at one end of Beaumont#
picking up as many blacks as they could# coming all the way
through the mid-county area and down into Port Arthur?
thereby# admittedly#

maximizing the minority strength in

tliat district.
I submit that the legislative intent is reflected
in the plans we did submit# was -that of the members of the
Delegations# and we sought to do no more, while maintaining
our position that the Legislature should have been given

50

the right to r©district if necessary.
Again I submit that the record in this case is
insufficient for a federal court to wipe out the entire State
policy of multi-member districts, based on the evidence and
based on the factors utilized by the federal coxirt beloxv.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE -BURGER;

Thank you, Mrs. Levatino.

Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted,
[Whereupon, at 2:21 o'clock, p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted,]
