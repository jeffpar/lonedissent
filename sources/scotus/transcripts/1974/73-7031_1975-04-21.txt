in 73-7031» Fowler against North Carolina,
Mr,, Amsterdam,, you may proceed whenever you’re ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY G„ AMSTERDAM, ESQ,»
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, AMSTERDAM?

Thank you» Mr. Chief Justice,

May it please the Courts
This case presents the single question» whether the
death sentence imposed upon petitioner» Jesse Fowler» under the
laws of North Carolina, constitutes a cruel and unusual
punishment tinder the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments,
Mr. Fowler is one of 47 persons presently on death
row in North Carolina who have been condemned to die as a
result of tit® 1973 decision of the North Carolina Supreme
Court* in State vs, Waddell.
The Waddell case was a response tc this Court's
decision in Furman yGeorgia» and in Waddell the North
Carolina Supreme Court prospectively severed and struck down
the so-called mercy proviso of North Carolina statutory law»
thereby leaving an automatic death penalty in effect in the
State of North Carolina for four crimess

first-degree murder?

rap©? first-degree burglary? and arson.
Mr. Fowler has been condemned to die for first-degree
murder in a prosecution predicated upon a theory of premedita-

4
tion and deliberation»
Our Eighth Amendment contention in this Court has
two aspects»
First, we believe that the arbitrary selectivity
permitted and encouraged by North Carolina procedures and
substantive lav; for the trial of capital cases involves the
same sort of latitude for prosecutorial enduring imposition
of the death penalty, the most extreme penalty known to the
law, that this Court condemned in Furman,
It is true that the procedures under which the
selected decisions are made are different, but the decision
to advert or to impose tine death penalty is no less
arbitrary„
Secondly, we contend that judged under proper Eighth
Amendment standards, the death penalty for any civilian

peacetime crime is now inconsistent with the evoMng standards
of decency that this Court has said are the measure of a
cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment»
Those two contentions are related, because the
same arbitrary selectivity, which enables a rare and wanton
imposition of the daath penalty and brings the case within
Furman, also explains why it is possible for a penalty to
persist legislatively, even though its regular and evenhanded application to more than a scant handful of randomly
chosen persons would affront contemporary standards of

5

decency.
However# the two aspects of the argument are divisible#
and I would like to take them separately? proceeding first to
our argument based directly on Furman,
In order to understand the nature of the North
Carolina procedures which we challenge, I think it's useful to
review briefly North Carolina law in both its substantive and
its procedural aspects# and I think it may be useful to the
Court# and I shall try to point to the places where North
Carolina law is different# if it is? from the law applicable
to capital trials in other jurisdictions.
I’d like to discuss North Carolina law under three
basic headings, I think all are relevant.
First# the breadth of offenses for which the death
penalty is authorised»
Secondly, the vague#subjective# intuitive# moralistic#
judgmental character of the distinctions? drawn between
capital offenses and non-capital offenses which allow juries
virtually total freedom to convict on a capital or non-capital
offense.
And# finally# the procedures under North Carolina
law# which permit the selective determination to be mad® of
who will live and who will die# using nothing more or less
than the vague substantive standards that North Carolina law
provides.

6
Now* first* with regard to the breadth of offenses.-,
In addition to the death penalty for rape* first”
degree burglary * and arson* North Carolina law* under Waddell *
provides the death penalty for the crime of first-degree
murder*
The crime of first-degree murder in North Carolina
is rather broad*

It can be made out by felony murder —

unlike many other jurisdictions * there are not* in North
Carolina* an exhaustive list of enumerated felonies upon
which felony murder can be predicated? any felony inherently
dangerous to life will support a first-degree murder
conviction under a felony murder theory*
And* in addition to that, first-degree murder can
be predicated on a number of specified means not involved
in tliio case, ouch as poison* torture, that sort of thing?
and al3o premeditation deliberation.
Fremeditation deliberation is very broad, as it has
been construed by North Carolina courts*

No appreciable

amount of prior thought, contemplation or reflection is
required.

Premeditation may be inferred from what is

sometimes called the excessive force or brutality used in a
particular killing; and this, although it is not uncommon in
the United States, is also not universal*

A number of

jurisdictions, for example, will not support a first-degree
murdsr conviction unless there is evidence of either prior

7
planning activity or motive or what is sometimes called
exacting manner? that is, a setting of a snare gun, or
seizing of a weapon and carrying it to a situs or something
of that sort»
North Carolina law requires none of that»

And I

think that it is significant that since 1903 the North
Carolina Supreme Court has never reversed a jury conviction
of first-degree murder for want of evidence of premeditation
deliberation»

And if you look at the various cases which

have been decided by North Carolina juries, in which verdicts
have been returned for first-degree murder or second-degree
murder or manslaughter, you will find that they are not in
any conceivable way rationally distinguishable»
fit no

pattern»

They simply

The jury goes in there and corns3 back —

if you look at Appendix C to our brief — with verdicts for
first-degree murder or second-degree murder or manslaughter»
And on the facts of any casc which will support a
second-degree murder conviction, tine North Carolina Supreme
Court will affirm a first-degree murder conviction.
There are four cases, actually two are alternative
grounds, in the entire history of North Carolina in which the
North Carolina Supreme Court has found evidence of premedita­
tion deliberation lacking,,

They were decided immediately

after the enactment of the 1093 statute that divided murder
into degrees.

And since that time there has been a significant

8

©volution of ihe concept of proof for premeditation delibera­
tion by inference,

So what we have, in effect, is that

virtually any killing with a gun is one in which the jury has
a complete option to find first-degree murder or seconddegree murder or manslaughter.
Now, that is somewhat broader, although, as I say,
it is no solecism, it is somewhat broader than what firstdegree murder is in most jurisdictions»
A second aspect of North Carolina law that is
significant is the definition of malice in North Carolina,
which is also an element of first-degree murder„
The significant thing here is that malice is said
to be presumed by law conferring the burden upon the defendant
to negate it,, in any case of the use of a deadly weapon; and
the burden of proof on the defendant to negate malice

is

said to be in the satisfaction of the jury, or to the
satisfaction of the jury»
Which doesn't mean a preponderance of the evidence,
doesn’t mean any weight of the evidence, North Carolina
judges are absolutely forbidden to charge about evidence at
all in that connection; it is simply the satisfaction of the
jury.
To give the Court an idea of the kinds of moralistic
terms that go to the jury, and on which the jury makes the
sorts of decisions that it makes, it may be worthwhile to

9
advert to the charge in this particular case*

And if the

Court looks at page 72 in the Appendix, you will see that
premeditation and deliberation is defined in a number of ways
in the second paragraph there? and it is said that ordinarily
premeditation end deliberation is not susceptible of direct
proof but may be inferred from circumstances, among others,
where the evidence shows that the killing is done in a brutal
and

ferocious manner.
Similarly, over on page 73, in connection with malice,

it is said that

at the end of the second complete paragraph

on the page — "malice may be general or particular and it
may be express or implied.

General malice is wickedness, a

disposition to do wrong regardless of social duty and fatally
bant on mischief."
The next to last paragraph on the page, that "when
there is no direct evidence of intent to kill but the fact, of
the killing is surrounded by such circumstances as to carry
a plain indication of some wicked intent of an aggravated
nature, then the law in such case implies malice.
Now, again, this is not a solecism under North
Carolina law.

The Court is doubtless familiar with the old

common law formulation that malice is abandoning a malignant
heart and that sort of thing? but North Carolina law, with
its peculiar burden on the defendant to negative malice to
the satisfaction of the jury, those make the determination

10

of the gravity of the offense an entirely subjective and
judgmental matter»
That brings me,, then, to how a defendant negatives
malice under North Carolina law, and here North Carolina lav;
is really quit© unique»

What will negative malice under

North Carolina lav; includes provocation and passion, with an
elaborate body of finespun moralistic notions»
To give the Court an example of that, in connection
with the provocation and passion doctrine, at the top of
page 75, in the Court's charge in this case, the court said
that an act of killing may be by provocation if it is the
result of temporary excitement by which the control of one's
reason is disturbed, and then goes on, "not from any
wickedness of heart or cruelty or recklessness of disposition

or desis» for revenge", ot cetera.
QUESTION:

Where are you reading from?

MR. AMSTERDAM*

The top of page 75, Mr, Justice

Brennan, of the Appendix ~QUESTION*

Yes.

MR. AMSTERDAM:

I mean which paragraph?
First paragraph.

Forgive me.

The very top line, "not from any wickedness" is the end of
that line.
QUESTION*

Yes, I see.

MR. AMSTERDAM;

So, in addition to the provocation

and passion doctrine, North Carolina law is quite unique in

11

recognizing a whole variety of other ways in which defendants
can get off a murder conviction,.
There’s the unreasonable fear doctrine„

The defendant

has no reasonable fear and acts in self-defense? but has .an
unreasonable fear, then that isn’t murder*

If a defendant has

some basis for action in self-defense but uses excessive
force, then that is manslaughter*

Ironically, because the

North Carolina courts also permit an inference of premeditation
and deliberation from grossly excessive force? so that the
distinction is between '’excessive force", which gives you
manslaughter, and "grossly excessive force", which may give
you first-degree murder*
Again, all of the various issues that go to malice
must be proved, quote, "to the satisfaction of the jury".
In addition, the self-defense doctrine involved in
this particular case is also highly moralistic*

Terms are

used about the defendant being free from fault, as was

used

in th© jury charge in this case, wrong or blame, and that sort
of thing*
Now, these substantive rules are very important
because when one considers the process through which a capital
case; goes, a series of decision makers must...apply, these kinds
of vague, amorphous and judgmental formulations, under which,
first, the prosecutor, then the grand jury, then the prosecutor
again, then a petit jury must determine whether or not the

12

defendant, in effect, deserves to die»
And that brings me to idle description of that
procedure, and again some unique features of North Carolina

lav/.
The charging decision in North Carolina is initially
made by a grand jury.

The grand jury may indict, for example,

for first-degree murder, a capital crime, or for seconddegree murder, a non-capital crime.
What is rather unique in North Carolina is the
prosecutor’s power to waive the death penalty.

The prosecutor

may simply announce when, the case is called to trial that he
is not going to try the case for first-degree, that he's
going to try it for second-degree; and that — or, as they
say in North Carolina, such lesser offenses as the evidence

may show

and that effectively announced to the criminal

the capital degree of the offense, there is no control over that
decision by the prosecutor, there is no judicial review of
it, it is simply an arbitrary decision by the prosecutor.
QUESTION:

But there's nothing unusual about

that, is there?
MR, AMSTERDAM:
QUESTION:

Pardon ras?

That's not unique in any way, is it?

That prosecutorial discretion is in no way unique
to North Carolina, is it?
MR, AMSTERDAM

Well, yes and no.

Prosecutors

13

make initial determinations what to charge in many jurisdietions*

It is rather rarca, though, that without explanation

or leave of court, prosecutor on a first-degree murder
indictment, can simply walk in and say, "We don’t want firstdegree" „
That is to say, ordinarily, once the indictment has
been returned —
QUESTIONS

Oh, you're talking about post-indictment?

MR, AMSTERDAM*

Yes, I am, indeed.

But the initial charging decision is quite common»
QUESTION:

Right»

MR» AMSTERDAM*

But it is that second step, if you

will, in North Carolina that is far more uncommon*

Again,

no unique, not solecisticj but far less common,
QUESTION t

How many — prosecutors in North

Carolina, I think, are called solicitors, are they not?
MR. AMSTERDAM:
QUESTION:

And is tliere one in each county?

MR. AMSTERDAM:
\

Yes, they’re called solicitors,

Yes, there is.

And that’s a

...

...

constitutional office in North Carolina, they are not subject
to control by the Attorney General'; the Attorney General could
not, for example, advise them to conform with any given set
of regulations on prosecution or non-prosecution,,
office which is undor no control but its own,
QUESTION:

Is it an elective office?

It is an

14
MR. AMSTERDAM:
QUESTION %

I believe that that is correct.

How many counties in North Carolina?

MR. AMSTERDAM:

That I would not know* Iem afraid

— I’m sure that my opposing counsel can inform the Court.
QUESTION:

In a North Carolina indictment, do

you simply state the crime of first-degree murder, or do you
have to state what penalty you may seek?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

In North Carolina, the indictment

for murder is an open murder indictment. That is to say,
the indictment is for murder, and then the prosecutor may
— an indictment which simply says that the defendant did
kill and murder.

For example, in this case, there's no

first-degree allegation as such, it simply says that the
defendant did kill and murder X on such-and-such a date.
QUESTION: So the prosecutor at the grand jury stage
doesn't have to commit himself, I take it?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

The grand jury doesn't have to

identify the degree of the offense.

However, it apparently

may, because if you look at some North Carolina cases you
see a description in them that the defendant was indicted
for second-degree murder.
Now, I am not sufficiently familiar with North
Carolina practice to know whether that is a unique feature
that a particular grand jury may just stick in; but I have
seen enough North Carolina murder indictments to know that

15
it is not uncommon to uso a general form of a murder indictment,
and that, too, is common in many States„
Simply an indictment charging murder, and then the
degree is treated as an aggravating circumstance provable at
trial, but not -QUESTION:

In that situation, the first time a

prosecutor would ever have occasion to elect is when he makes
his opening statement, isn’t it?
MR, AMSTERDAM:

That is unclear„

That is to say,

it is unclear how much effect -the prosecutor himself will have
on a grand jury,
QUESTION:

No, I don’t — I mean his opening

statement to the petit jury,
MR, AMSTERDAM:

No, but what I mean is that it is

his first opportunity to elect, in the sense that presumably
he could ask the grand jury to come back with a second-degree
murder indictment if he chose to.
And if it is true that a grand jury may return a
second-degree murder indictment, and if, as is not uncommon,
a grand jury will do what the prosecutor wishes.

Then I assume

that tine prosecutor can ask the grand jury to come back with
second-degree? in which case it would not be his first
opportunity after the indictment comes down,
QUESTION:

Well, Mr, Amsterdam, may there he a

separate form of indictment for manslaughter?

16
MR* AMSTERDAM?

The allegation for manslaughter

would indeed be different, because the murder allegation
charge is with malice aforethought; and manslaughter indict»
meat would notc
QUESTION;

And yet I gather from what you said

earlier, under the open form of murder indictment, charging
with malice aforethought, the jury, whatever the prosecutor
may do, is at liberty to bring in either a second-degree
verdict or a manslaughter verdict?
MR® AMSTERDAM;

Yes, that is correct®

They

cannot, however, bring in a first»degree verdict if the
prosecutor waives it.

If -the prosecutor says, when the case

is called, "We're not seeking first-degree", then they may not
bring in first-degree, but they may bring in either seconddegree or they may bring in manslaughter®
QUESTION;
traditional

That's correct3

But manslaughter is included as a

lesser-included offense, is it not?

MR® AMSTERDAM:
QUESTION;

Oh, yes, it certainly is*

They can always return a manslaughter

verdict on a murder indictment, can't they?
MR* AMSTERDAM;
QUESTION;

A voluntary —

They are always free to do that*

MR® AMSTERDAM:

Yes®

A

voluntary manslaughter

conviction, or perhaps even involuntary manslaughter in some
circumstances could be returned on the? ordinary murder indict-

17
ment, and that is true in most States*
Now, —
QUESTION ?

Mr» Amsterdam, the indictment in this

case does say "with malice aforethought".

So this is a first»'

degree, isn't it?
MR. AMSTERDAM?

Well, it is an open murder indict»

meat, that is correct? that is, it will support a first»
degree —
QUESTION?

Well, "with malice aforethought"can"t

be anything but first-degree, can it?
MRe AMSTERDAM?
QUESTION;

Well, yes, it could, indeed»

How?

MRC AMSTERDAM;

A killing with malice aforethought

is second-degree murder, you have to super-add to that
premeditation and deliberation to make it first-degree,
QUESTION?

Yes, I know.

QUESTION?

But doesn't the indictment also refer

to Section 1417, which is the first-degree murder statute?
MR. AMSTERDAM?
QUESTION:

I'm sorry, Mr. Justice Blackmun?

I say, I*m looking at the indictment,

as Justice Marshall was, and it ends up with a citation of
G„S. 14-17, which I think is the first-degree murder statute,
is it not?
MR, AMSTERDAM?

No, 14-17, Mr. Justice Blackmun, If

you look in our brief at page 2, covers both first and second»

13

degree murder*

That is to say, it distinguishes the two

and sets the penalty for both*
So that it is an appropriate citation for firstdegree murder» or it is an appropriate citation for seconddegree murder indictment*
But this is exactly the form of open indictment
that I was describing» in which a jury can come back with
either one*
Now, the prosecutor also has the option, of course,
of plea bargaining, and this also is quite common, indeed
universal.
What is significant, if you take a look at the
record in Wake County, and we have referred to that in our
brief, is that during the 15-month period during which the
WaddQll procedures were in effect, we had at least 17 indict­
ments which could have resulted in capital verdicts, to which
lesser-include defense pleas were accepted, resulting in non­
capital sentences*

And what that means is that during that

same period there were three cases that abutted at capital
verdicts.
So that if you take only the plea bargaining aspect
and you don’t take the charging discretion in either the
first bite or the second bite, you don’t take the jury's
discretion, you don’t take the — you’re not there yet —
the Governor's discretion; take none of -that*

You’re talking

19
about 15 percent of the cases where the grand jury concluded
that there was probable cause of a capital offense, going
through to a conviction for a capital offense.
Finally, of course, there is executive clemency,
again a very common institution, procedurally somewhat less
controlled in North Carolina than elsewhere by the absence
of reporting requirements and other procedures, but perhaps
not materially different in that regard.
What is interesting is the extraordinary use of
clemency in North Carolina, where virtually two-thirds of
persons sentenced to death, over long periods of time in this
century, have been commuted.
So that the effect of the gubernatorial discretion,
sitting upon the whole discretion of the trial system, is
again to avert the actual infliction of the death penalty in
a very, vary large percentage of the cases»
QUESTION!

Do I understand your use of executive

clemency, then, is directed toward its use, not its existence?
MR. AMSTERDAM!

No, I would say that we’re not

challenging its use in -the sense that an equal protection
claim', let us say, might be based on discrimination in the
actual application of it.

What we are saying is that, if you

take a look at the North Carolina procedure as a whole, that
you have to appreciate that very little or no difference
exists between the North Carolina practice under Waddell and

20
the practices which this Court struck down in Furman,
Executive clemency in North Carolina is so frequently used
that when it sits on top of all of the other opportunities
in the system to avert a sentence of death, the result is the
same kind of rare, arbitrary, highly selected infliction
of the extremo penalty of death that this Court found a
cruel and unusual punishment in Furman»
QUESTION:

Well, if it's highly selective, it's

one thing? if it*s highly arbitrary, it’s something quit©
different.

Did you mean highly selective?
MR« AMSTERDAM:

Well, I am not using selective

in the sense of selection of a few appropriate cases, I am
using selective simply to describe a process of selecting,
in the same way that one. can say discriminating or
discriminatory and not have that much difference unless you're
pretty confident in who is making the decision»
Her® the decision is being mad® by whatever
number of solicitors there are in North Carolina, plus a
shuttling corps of jurors brought in for particular cases,
over whom there is no control at all»
Now, in that situation, it is our position — and
I think this may speak directly to Mre Justice Blackmun's
point

it is our position that, the administration of

capital punishment with substantive standards as vague,
amorphous and judgmental as these, through a system of

21
decisions by individual de cion-makers, who are a fleeting
group assembled to hear one case and then disbanded, or
solicitors who vary from county to county and may be in or
may be out.

So that whether you get sentenced to life or

whether you get sentenced to death is a luck of the draw, at
best, and invidious discrimination at worse.
That that system is what is bad»

And that is why,

in a sens®, Mr. Justice Blackmun, yes, we’re talking about
its exercise, but we’re also talking about its existence.
There is no way in which, administering a system of
this sort, one can come out with the comfortable conclusions
assarted, for example, in the government’s amicus brief in
this Court, that the death penalty is being reserved for the
worst cases, or that it’s being reserved for the most heinous
cases, or any such thing.
And, indeed, the case before the Court proves it»
It is xtfhat we have in the case of Jassa Thurman
Foxtfler is any other shooting that comes out of a barroom
braxv'l.

It is no more or less, than that.

This Court has *

seen, I venture to say, thousands of them? they are papered
very often as manslaughter, they are papa rad as second-degree
murder, and when they are submitted as first-degree murder
ci&sas, juries come back indiscriminately with first-degree
murder, s e con d- de gree murder, or manslaughter.

There is

simply nothing to assure, in a process of this sort, any

22
regularity in the imposition of the death penalty,.
Selective, Mr® Justice Stewart, in the sense that
people are selected? arbitrary in the sense that the way in
which they are selected is so rule-less,, so ungoverned by
any procedures that would enable a rational decision to be
made, that the death penalty is simply inflicted,. arbitrarily,
at the ©nd of —
QUESTIONt
or yourso

I want to be sure about my logic her©*

Isn't this argument you're now making about

executive clemency equally applicable to any other crime# so
that if it prevails you demolish the entire criminal justice
structure?
MR. AMSTERDAM?

No, I don't think that that is so

at all, and, indeed, Mr. Justice Blackmun, the — it isn't
simply the executive clemency argument as to which I would
draw that distinction.

A certain amount of discretion is

involved in the prosecution of criminal cases at the
prosecutorial level and at the jury level, as well as the
gubernatorial level.
I think that there is a constitutional difference
between capital and non-capital cases, and th® constitutional
difference lies in several dimensions.
First of all, Furman held that a frank choice
given to a jury or to a judge, because a number of cases
decided by this Court in the wake of Furman involved

23

judicial sentencing and not jury sentencing* among the
penalties of life, death and sometimes a term of years*
violated the Eighth Amendment,
I did not see anything in this Court’s opinion in
Furman and would not-construe it* nobody has construed it* to
mean that a choice of a judge between five years and ten years
or a choice of a judge between twenty years and thirty years
is*simply

because it is of the same nature as the discretion

condemned in Furman * subject to constitutional invalidation.
And it gives a very good reason for that distinction.
The death penalty is unique»

Not only in the law under Furman*

but in fact.
The government’s suggestion that an attack on
discretion in the imposition of the most extreme penalty
known to the law* a penalty which consists of separating the
defendant from an entire penal regime* the ordinary regime of
incarceration with its rehabilitative prospects and ideals
and possibilities for second thoughts in judgments and

s

paroles* and doing the one thing that is totally irromsdial»
The one thing that we don’t even understand, because :we don’t ev'
know what it is when we kill somebody* is simply* really* a
different thing» There isn’t anybody in the history of law*
and this Court time and again has recognised it* denies that
death is different from other penalties»
W ••

Now* I think it is therefore true that where prO“

24
csdures that may be used to inflict a penalty of that sort
may constitutionally be different, than the penalties which »■
than the procedures which are used to inflict lesser
penalties*
Indeed, I think that the history of the Eighth
Amendment itself, particularly the English history of the
Bill of Rights, is rather strongly supportive of this,
Ona thing that modern scholarship has shown up about the
history of the English Bill of Rights is that it is not
true, as was once supposed, that, it was primarily a concern
against the torments and tortures of the bloody assizes that
resulted in the English Bill of Rights in 1689,
In fact, those penalties — disemboweling, drawing
and quartering, and that sort of thing

continued for a

century and a half in England, well after the Bill of Rights
Of 1689*
What, the Bill of Rights of 1689 is concerned with
was precisely selective, arbitrary infliction of extreme
penalties, such aa the penalty imposed on Titus Oates, which
was, in effect, the death sentence, not then authorized by
law, although it was disguised as something else*
And historically, as well as factually, there is a
considerable difference between the arbitrary infliction of
extreme penalties and the infliction of lesser penalties,
Nov.», that, I take it, is exactly what cruel and

25
unusual in the Eighth Amendment; is all about,,

When a penalty is

so harsh that it is only through a system such as this one
that it can be made tolerable, where its social acceptance is
purchased through the devices of arbitrariness which infect the
North Carolina procedure, that is the clearest indication of a
penalty which is a cruel and unusual punishment.
Now, inasmuch as I have two able counsel to contend
with, I*d prefer to reserve, unless the Court has further
questions, the balance of my time.
QUESTION?

To clarify one factual question, you

referred to a barroom brawl, and I was not clear whether you
were speaking in general terras or describing this as a barroom
brawl.
MR. AMSTERDAM*
a brawl in a barroom..

The killing here did not result in

It was a fallout, at three hours removed,

from a previous fight in a bar, in which the deceased, who had
known the defendant for many years, broke his nose as a result
of an attack initiated by the deceased.
It is in that sense a barroom brawl,
QUESTION:

was it, that he went and got himself a weapon and —
MR. AMSTERDAM:

There was an interval, but he did

not go and get himself a weapon, the record indicates that he
was carrying a gun all day, that that v/as not uncommon, that
he was carrying it because a fishing trip had been planned,

26

and everybody in that group carried weapons to shoot snakes
when they went out to fish? and he had th© weapon in his
pocket throughout the earlier fight with the deceased,.
QUESTION:

But it was three hours later when he

used it?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

Yes, it was, indeed, Mr. Chief

Justice*
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr* Renoy.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEAN A. BEHOY, ESQ*,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR* BENOYs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
The State of North Carolina of course contends here
that the death penalty is not cruel and unusual, per se,
for any of the reasons stated by the petitioner*
We state, and we say and contend to the Court,
that it has not been rejected by the decent standards of
contemporary, civilized society.

Indeed, the exact converse

has been amply demonstrated since this Court’s Furman decision
by the actions of 31 Stato Legislatures, the Congress of the
United States, juries throughout the United States, and
trial and appellate courts throughout the United States,
to charge, try, convict and sentence men and women to death*
It has not been demonstrated, indeed, it has not
even been claimed here that North Carolina officials have

27

acted,, since Furman# in a manner which was condemned by the
Furman decision,

That is# attempting to sentence some to

death and others to life# who have been found guilty of equal
degress of the crime of murder or rape*
The actual judgments which have been exercised by
the appropriate officials in the criminal justice system of
North Carolina do not create# ipso facto# in and of themselves#
a system which of necessity results in an arbitrary#
discriminatory# capricious or freakish sentences.
Now# that is the position of the State of North
Carolina,
There are several misstatements of the status of law
of North Carolina# made by counsel for petitioner# which
permeats not only his statement here but in his brief.
Now# for example# first of all# he says and contends
that in the State of North Carolina the solicitor or the
district attorney has a virtually unbridled discretion to do
or not to do that which he sees fit; and the rule of law# Your
Honor# in North Carolina is exactly the converse.
?

Stated in State v, Thurmidge# 250 N.C. 616# at page
623# is the proper statement of the rule of law in North
Carolina.

The rule is that it is within the control of the

court as to whether to allow a solicitor to nolle prosse a
case# plea bargain or anything else, but it is usually and
properly left to the discretion of the solicitor.

28

Now, that is the rule of law, therefore he does
not have an unbridled discretion, charging discretion.
Secondly, in North Carolina we do not have what is
called the presentment.

We have an indictment»

And a man

must be charged with a capital offense by an indictment under
the Constitution of North Carolina,

We did away with pre­

sentments as a charging vehicle.
However, in North Carolina, the presentment is
available to the grand jury and is an instruction to the
solicitor to send in a bill of indictment charging a citizen
with an offense in the State of North Carolina, and he must
do so.
The next thing in North Carolina, if he wilfully
fails to do his duty, that which he is sworn to do under
G.S..7A-66, sets forth the various provisions by which a
solicitor may be removed from office? and under 14-230 of
the criminal statute, if he wilfully refuses to carry out
his sworn duties, he will be guilty of a misdemeanor and
subject to two years' imprisonment,
Nov;, we say and contend, Your Honor, that the
solicitor, under those charges of the lav;, under the control
of the court, does not have an unfettered or unbridled dis­
cretion, which was the subject of this Furman

— this Court's

Furman decision.
QUESTIONi

Is there a solicitor in each county?

29

MR» BENOYs

No, sir, Your Honor, there are, I think,

22 solicitorial districts — there are 100 counties in the
State, and he is, there are these solicitorial districts, from
which he is elected*

He has supervisory authority or

responsibility for prosecuting those cases in his —

solicitorial district?
MR, BENOYr
QUESTION;

Yes, sir, he is a —
For how long a terra?

MRc BENOY;

Four years.

He is a constitutional

officer of the Stats of North Carolina.
It's true that the Attorney General does not have
supervisory authority, that is, he cannot go and tell him to
prosecute or not prosecuta? but the trial judge, if he sees
an arbitrary abuse of discretion by the solicitor, he certainly
has control over him.

He can refuse to let him nolle prosso

a case, he can refuse to let him plea bargain, and he can
remove him from office.
And he car?, have another prosecuting attorney come
in and prosecute that solicitor under 14-230 for the commission
of a crime.
That's hardly discretion that the jury had, and the
sentencing discretion that the judges had in the Furman

30

decision,.
So we think there's a material difference there*
There are — I see, we've hit the grand jury? we've
touched on the sentencing, or the charging discretion.
The next thing the petitioner says and contends,
which we don't understand, is that by virtue of having a
trial through a jury of twelve of an offense in the State of
North Carolina, which is guaranteed by both the North Carolina
Constitution, guaranteed by the United States Constitution,
the Sixth Amendment, petitioner says this very right to
trial by jury violates the Eighth Amendment,
And we submit, as we stated in our brief, that
that's a non sequitur»

That just does not make sense»

The next thing we say, that the Constitution of
the United States, ,in the Fifth Amendment and the Fourteenth
Amendment,specifically authorise and contemplate the
imposition of death penalties, as we pointed out in our brief»
Capital crimes or capital offenses, which is
sp€illed out in the Fifth Amendment, meant in 1776, from an
encyclopedia of that 1771 date, meant a punishment for which
death may be imposed»
And in the dictionaries and encyclopedias of 197475, capital crimes, capital offenses mean identically the
sam© things

a sentence by vfhich death may be imposed»

When you consider the exact wording of the

31
Constitution, when you consider the actions of the duly elected
representatives of the people of the United States and the
State of North Carolina, we say and contend that the death
penalty is not condemned, it is authorized and in fact in
North Carolina by Act of the General Assembly it is mandated
in certain very heinous crimes- such as death, first-degree
murder, and rape.
QUESTION:

I didn’t understand Mr. Amsterdam to say

that the death penalty was not authorized by the Constitution,
but only that with the evolving standards it has now become
outmoded.
MR. BEHOYs

And we responded to that, Mr. Chief

Justice, in the brief, in saying that if it*s outmoded, the
means to amend the Constitution is set forth in the Constitution
itself? and it's not for this Court, we submit, with all due
respects, to be amending the Constitution itself and to be
nullifying express provisions found in the Constitution,
We say that would be the necessary result to apply
the Eighth Amendment in the manner in which petitioner complains,
Let's see ~ I am glad to note that petitioner's
counsel did state that he was arguing fox* a per se application
of the Eighth Amendment to the situation, based upon the
pre-verdict activities of the constitutional official of tbs
State of North Carolina.
Now I would like to make a distinction here, if w<s

32
Cc&in n

As I understand the Furman casa» and as we set forth
our understanding of the Furman case in our brief, what it
was talking about here, what this Court was concerned with,
was the post-verdict sentencing activities of judges and
juries when they were sentencing one group of people to one
type of punishment for an equal degree of crime as another
defendant.
We*re talking about here post-verdict activities
of public officials in the sentencing process.
What petitioner raises here at, let's see, at
pages of his brief — the first pages of his brief, the
page, I believe it is starting at page 45, the district
attorney? plea bargaining, 53 to 61? jury discretion, 62 to
94.
He is not talking hare about post-verdict
activities of anybody.

He's talking about the very crux of

the criminal justice system in the United States,
talking about the activities of a grand jury.
about the activities of the solicitor.

You're

He's talking

He is talking about

the activities of the jury system itself, which is all there
— to do what?

To determine the truth of the matter.

That is what this whole system is about.
nothing to do with sentencing.
of

It has

And that's what he complains

The last factor that he complains of is the
governor’s ability to grant commutations of sentences? and we
stipulated that the governor has that authority,,

We also

stipulated that this Court has held that there's nothing
unconstitutional, per so, about that*

That that is not

subject to judicial reviewc
That’s not to say if in some future point of time
a governor started commuting the sentences of all the whites,
all the rich, letting the black or the white poor go to the
death house, that this Court could not intervene in a proper
case and stats that that is an arbitrary application of the
powers of the governor.
In other words, if we get to, as an applied argument,
if the juries start applying the law improperly, violating
their oath of office, if ths district attorney starts applying
the law in violation of his oath of office, if the grand jury
is doing something that is violative of its oath of office,
than of course, YourHonor, there is an adequate remedy at that
time „
But to just wipe it out, in this case, with no
presentation of facts, and on the assumption, the underlying
assumption that it is, per se, discriminatory, our whole
criminal justice system is, per se, discriminatory? I don’t
know how you can separate the constitutional mandates between
life and liberty.

There is only on© comma separating the

34
constitutional mandate of life and liberty»

And if this

Court were to state, or if it were to hold that the mere
existence of the grand jury, district attorney, and jury
discretion to find facts upon the evidence, to bring
charges based upon the evidence and the law according to their
oath of office as they understand the Constitution of the
United States, and the law of North Carolina, if the Court
were to embark upon that course of action, then it's a
very short step to then says

and the very same constitutional

defects exist as to deprivation of a man’s liberty,,
And when you do go to that step, you have then done
away with the criminal justice system in the United States
as we know it.
And I don’t believe, and I say and contend, the
State of North Carolina says and contendo, that that is not
what the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, nor the
Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States
says and means»
Now, —
QUESTION:'

In that last illustration that you gave,

would you call on tine equal protection clause to deal with
that?
MR. BENOY:

Yes, sir, I believe that’s what the

equal protection clause is there for.
Mad the State of North Carolina, as we pointed out in

35

our brief, Your Honor, has been very, very diligent in pursuing
the protection of the citizens under the equal protection law,
since this Court has made its interpretation of the meaning of
the Fourteenth Amendment,.

Particularly in the area of race

relations0
Not only that, the 1960 or *61 amendment to ■— or
the new North Carolina Constitution specifically outlawed,
under the North Carolina Constitution, any discrimination based
upon race, creed, color, or otherwise»
So that the State of North Carolina is not exactly
as characterized in petitioner's brief, and our Supreme Court
ha& not, by any tortuous reasoning, attempted to emasculate
a decision of this Court»
QUESTION:

General Benoy, when you suggest that

these problems could be dealt with on a case-by-case or ad hoc
or particularized basis, how, possibly, could they be, when
one stops to think that the grand jury proceedings are secret?
the prosecutor,before a grand jury even is called upon to act,
makes his decisions privately or in consultation with his own
subordinates? the governor’s executive clemency authority,
everybody agrees, is wholly unreviewablee

So if the governor

decided to commute the sentence of every Catholic but not
to commute the sentences of any Protestants? how on earth
could anybody do anything about that?

The fact that, for example, if the

to death, then it seems to me that a prima facie case could
be made at chat point»

That wasn't even brought up.
Now, I'm surprised at one thing that was said here
that

where did he say that the — well, he said that the

North Carolina Supreme Court has said that the burden of
proof shifts to the defendant»
There's not a single case in the State of North
Carolina that can be cited where the court has ever said, at
any time, at any stage of any criminal trial, the burden of
irde:n of
ft proofs"

proof shifts to a single defendant»

Even when he defends on

self-defense or alibit, the burden of proof never shifts in
the State of North Carolina, and even any intimation in the
charge of the trial court to the jury will get you an automatic
reversal by that State Supreme Court.
Now, that is just simply a misstatement»
And another thing he says that in North Carolina,
for example, in proving on© of the elements of offense, he
said that the rule is that it must be proved to the satisfaction
of the jury; and the rule in the charge of every criminal
case that I’ve ever tried in the State of North Carolina,
both as a solicitor and as a member of the Attorney General's
staff, that's been the rule, is beyond a reasonable doubt, and
to a moral certainty, as to each and every distinct element
of the offense charged, which includes premeditation and
malic© in a first-degree murder charge.
that
And you’ll find/in the charge of this case, at record

So I don’t know exactly where counsel for petitioner
gets his law# but he didn’t gat it out of the North Carolina
law books# and he didn’t get it out of the transcripts of
the superior court of that Stato, nor the appellate court.
Now# ho said that Jeese Fowler was killed in a bar­
room brawl [sic] 0

The facts of this case are that John

Griffin had been in a fight with this defendant, and John

he got it a3 fast as we could got it to him, but he died
before we could save his life — now John Griffin had been

He had

He had gone to visit his two pre-teenage

Ho was standing on the public streets of the

State of North Carolina, visiting his daughters, talking to
one of his neighbors, and this fellow,Jesse Thurman Fowlsr,
came by in a car with his nephew and his nephew stopped the
car, they called Fowler over — rather Ctilled John Griffin
over.
John Griffin told Fowlert

Go on away, I don’t

want to fight you any more.
II© then — Fowler then drove away, goes on up
the block# tells his nephew to stop the car and let him out,
stalks this decedent, John Griffin, stalks him xvith a gun#
shoots twice while the defendant — or while the deceased,

45
Griffin# was trying to protect himself behind a man# the
body of a man who was walking along the streets of the State
of North Carolina.
If that is not stalking and killing# I do not know
what stalking and killing is.
But that’s exactly what this man did# Your Honor#
exactly what he did.

And it seems to me the underlying

policy of the State of North Carolina is that we dignify the
life of a black man with the same high degree that we value
the life of a white man.

And when we say that a mandatory

penalty for rape shall be death, that means if you rape a
black woman in the State of North Carolina# you’re going to
the gas chamber for it*
And it seems to me that that’s a recognition of an
underlying policy# whereby the State of North Carolina
dignifies the sexuality of a black woman to the same high
degree it does a whits woman.

And we make no apologies for

that to anyone*
Now# we say and contend that the Supreme -- that
this Supreme Court has never held that the cruel and unusual
clause# nor has any State in the Union# except California ~~
v

*

which we'll talk about in a minute — that no State in the
Union has ever interpreted a cruel cind unusual proviso in the
Constitution# which exists in some form or other in 48 of
them# to mean that the death penalty is prohibited*

46

In the State of California# they so held# and the
result of that was a vote by the people of the State of
California, by a two-to-one majority, saying that the death
penalty will be authorized in the State of California»
So it seems to me that when you consider the
contemporary standards of decent, civilized people, which the
State of North Carolina says and contends, that the State of
North Carolina and the United States of America takes no
back seat to any nation on the face of this earth to its
standards of decency and civilized conduct, where we have a
rule of law, where we’re trying to protect innocent citizens,
guarantee the right of innocent passage and the ability to
walk the streets of our cities and our counties and our State,
to rest at horns in peace and dignity and with some
of security.

degree

That that’s what government is about.

And we" say and contend that these standards of
civilized society are second to none.

We do not take any

back seat to anybody on them»
W® do not agree with petitioner in saying that we
have in some i^ay or other become the low rung on the totem
pole -— you can't, use four-letter words here.
But we say and contend, YourHonor, that when you
examine the Furman, decision, you will find that it was —*
and of course this Court wrote it — that it deals with postverdict activities, where there was an unbridled discretion

47
given to the judges or the juries *

They had applied that

unbridled discretion in an arbitrary and capricious manner,
so that you endec up with a freakish imposition of the death
sentence.
That's what the Court seemed to so hold.
We say and contend that the Republican response to
the Furman decision of this Court was to remove that unbridled
discretion, which this Court found offended the Constitution
of the United States, and we are now sentencing all equally,
and petitioner's complaints about the trial procedures set up
for the entire administration of criminal justice in the
United States does not violate anything that was even
addressed to in the Furman casa»

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H„ EORK, ESQ. f
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. BORK:

Mr. Chief Justice* may it please the

Courts
A good deal of the argument has been taken up with
matters peculiar to North Carolina law in the facts of this
case, and of course the United States has no interest
whatever in that.
The United States is here merely to ask that
whatever the outcome of this particular case, the Court make
it clear that capital punishment is constitutional, and
that the more on prudential judgments about its general
use lie with the elected representatives of the people.
Now, I'm going to discuss an aspect of this case
that is not fully developed in the briefs, and that is this t
Part of the majority in Furman v„ Georgia rested
upon empirical judgments.

That may be properly revised, I

believe, in the course of a continuing dialogue between this
Court and the political branches of the federal and State
governments.
Nov;, I want to examine certain of those empirical
judgments, to show that they are no longer valid and should
be revised, and that, thus, both the death penalty and
statutes leaving discretion with juries should, as in McGautha,
be held constitutional.

49
The first proposition I want to discuss is the
observation in Furman that under a discretionary statute the
legislative will is not frustrated if the death penalty is
never imposed»
That was an empirical observation, of course? perhaps
debatable then, but the proposition of course is not in
disproof, because the Congress and the State Legislatures
have responded by enacting laws that do show the legislative
will? and they show that the States and the Congress prefer
mandatory statutes to none*

Showing that the legislative will

is frustrated if the death penalty is never imposed»
The second proposition is closely related»

It is

that death penalties under discretionary statutes are cruel,
in the sensa that they excessively go beyond, no in degree, but
ili kind, the punishments that the State Legislatures have
determined to bo necessary»
That, too, might have been debatable, because the
State Legislatures may have thought that punishment of that
sort was not necessary in every case»
'i

But the doubt has now become a certainty, because,
again, most States and the Congress have determined that they
think, which is the proposition here, that they think the. death
penalty is necessary»
The third proposition, of course, is that the penalty
is unusual and that it is infrequently imposed»

50
Well# I9m not sure what the statistics show about
that»

1 do know that at the time of Furman# 600 persons were

under the penalty? I am told that now perhaps 200 persons
are under the penalty in the last year and a half.
And in the study in the Stanford Law Review# cited
in our brief# the jury imposed the death penalty in 103
cases cut of 236 capital convictions.

So that that frequency#

it seems to me# a Legislature might well think — or a much
lower frequency# the Legislature might well think# to be
sufficient to achieve deterrent purposes and to reinforce
social values.
And# if so# I would not call that unusual in that
it*s infrequent.
Nov;# the major argument# X suppose# is that if
the penalty is so unique# is that it's capriciously and
freakishly imposed.

And petitioner’s major argument is

really based here, arguing that there are so many stages
of discretion in the criminal justice system, in any
criminal justice system# that the result is bound to be
arbitrary.

I would suppose that were true only if the
discretion was exercised without, some degree

of normal

human judgment# if it were# in fact# a coin toss at every
step.

And there is no showing, of course# that it is a coin

toss at every step.

51

It seams to

hi©

that the fatal defect in the

contention that's advanced is this;

the Framers of the

Constitution which we are interpreting wrote into it both an
assumption of a death penalty and wrote into it a requirement
of discretion.

They — in requiring a grand jury, in requiring

a petit jury, in assuming a law officer who might or might not
go for evidence! under the Fourth Amendment*,

In writing in a

pardon and reprieve power, they put in discretion at every
step.
And, furthermore, they put their Constitution on
top of a system of criminal justice they presupposed, which
had discretion at every stage.
So that the constitutional criminal justice system
breathes discretion at every pore.

And, in fact, I can't

understand that a constitutional system that presupposes
discretion somehow makes unconstitutional a constitutional
system that presupposes the allowability of the death penalty.
My mind bogg3.es at the proposition that one part of the
constitutional system renders another part of the same system
uncon s titutional.
In any event, I would like to point out, we have
been looking at discretion here from the wrong end.

The

discretion which is in the system is not the defect of the
system, it is indeed the genius of the system.
The petitioner's brief shows how many stages at which

52
discretion may occur,,
freakish.

I don't think that makes the system

I think it makes the system safe.
Indeed, progress in criminal justice has usually

been accomplished, or very often been accomplished by
increasing rather than decreasing the occasions for fresh
judgment and discretion*
As the system now stands, it is utterly impossible
for one person or, at some stage, for several persons,
acting out of prejudice or out of stupidity, to inflict the
death penalty.

But at ©very stage it is possible for a

small group to stop ‘the death penalty from being inflicted,
and at several stages it’s possible for one person to stop
the death penalty from being inflicted,,
QUESTION«

Of course, if nobody is singularly

responsible, then that can lead, as we all know, to a buck­
passing mentality*
MR, BORKs

It can, Your Honor,

QUESTIONi

Take the famous case of Private Slavik,

we're all familiar withy everybody along the line thought
the next person would exercise clemency,
MR* BORKi

That's true*

There was, at that time,

a tradition in the military justice system of giving maximums,
so that the commanding officer could exercise clemencyD
QUESTIONS

That's right*

MR. EORKs

There is no such tradition in the

53
systems ive* re discussing today, and I donv t think there is
in the military justice system any more, either.
But surely I don’t think juries anywhere convict
in order to allow the Governor to exercise clemency»
QUESTION:

Well, there was a study, that we had

the last time this basic question was argued, showing
purporting to show, or leading to the inference that juries
sometimes did bring in the death penalty with the belief that
it would never be carried out.
MR. BORIC:

They may.

They may.

I would -think a discretionary statixte would be bette
in that, sense, because the jury wouldn’t have to rely upon
clemency.
The best studies we have, and I don’t see anything
in petitioner’s brief that matches it, the study from the
Stanford Law Review, which was an enormous study and which
Professor Kalven, in writing for -that, said was the best study
he had aver seen, showed indeed that juries were making
distinctions and rational distinctions, and showed indeed
that there was no reason to think, in that system, that there
was any racial discrimination in tine discretion the juries
used*
So that I think the jury system, when studied,
performs better than many of us think it would, offhand.
Remembering that they are people who are capable of studying

54

this matter and making judgments, and there are all these
other stages of discretion that act as safeguards *
Which is not to say that a case may never get
througho

It shouldn't,.

It is merely that discretion is to

be viewed as the good part of the system and not a reason for
taking away a penalty that is in the system»
QUESTION:

Has it not been a general view in —

or a widespread if not general view, that mandatory sentences
are, per se, bad»
MR. BORK:

Well, I don't know what the

I

certainly would view a mandatory sentence statute as less
good than a discretionary sentencing statute, because ~QUESTION:

I'm thinking of the attacks directed

at the five and ten and twenty-year mandatory sentences in
the drug area, for example,
MR. BORK*

Oh, yes.

The mandatory sentencing is

becoming more mid more infrequent in the system»
QUESTION:

But the mandatory sentence in th© death

cases seem to b© the one ©scape hatch left open to the States,
in Furman, did it not?
MR. BORK:

It did, indeed, Mr» Chief Justice,

and that is why I am suggesting that I think it’s preferable,
given the empirical propositions in Furman, which I think have
now been shown — may have bean valid then, but have now bean
shown to be currently invalid by the actions of the States

55

and the Congress responding to Furman,,
It would now be preferable to allow discretion at
the jury stage»

If not, it would certainly bo preferable* I

think* to allow something like the Federal Air Hijacking Act
of 1974* which specifies the items to be considered* takes
the discretion out of the

must be considered* requires

special findings as to each item of mitigation* each item of
aggravation* and tells the judge what sentence he must give*
depending on whether one of those items is present or not»
That seems to be an allowable response to Furman»
If Furman is regarded as still standing with those empirical
propositions after the responso that we have seen.
But these arguments against discretion in the
system arc * as has beer, suggested* arguments against any
form of punishment.
And capital punishment may be unique in every sense
but one.

It is not, unique in a constitutional sense.

It has

been presupposed by the Constitution* and has been practiced
under the Constitution throughout our history,
A legislative line can be drawn* and Legislatures
do draw lines* about capital punishment* saving it for certain
crimes.
The federal government has done that* and the States
have done that* and that* it seems to me* i3 the way
in the capital punishment system should occur.

changes

56

As tli© — it seems to me that the odd thing about
the petitioner’s argument is that they’re arguing that the
criminal justice system is too inperfect to permit the
imposition of a death penalty, and precisely at that monent,
in our history, when our criminal justice system has had
built into it, by this Court and by legislation, more
procedural safeguards than at any other time in Anglo-American
history»
And it appears occasionally that the better the
system becomes, the more agitated its opponents become»
And 'the argument here is, apparently, that a criminal justice
system would be tolerable, where the death penalty is involved
at least, only where it is not run by humans»
Now, I think a word should bo said about the
concern about the possibility of racial prejudice entering
into sentencing.
It is impossible for me to stand here and say that
that does not happen..

It is

also impossible for anybody to

stand here and say that it does happen on -die evidence we
have been offered by the petitioner’s counsel.
Their main evidence appears to be at page 136 of
their brief, Not© 226«

The authorities there are quite

conflicting and quite simplistic. The analysis is quite poor
in those, but the authorities there cited contradict each
other

One study purports to find racial bias» another
study» by Mr. Bedau, says that if you look at additional
factors» the racial bias washes out? such as number of previous
convictions, for similar crimes.
I*m afraid that footnote is not enough to sustain a
finding of a pattern, an inevitable pattern in the infliction
of the death penalty across the entire criminal justice
system, which would be what is required to strike down the
death penalty in every and all cases.
And 1“ve already noted the Stanford study, which
says that, indeed, in the way the race factor is handled,
there is nothing to complain of in the capital punishment
sentences handed down.

And I believe one of the studies in

the petitioner's footnote, by Mr. Bedau, shows that in New
Jersey there is similarly not a problem with capital punish”
ment being inflicted according to race.
I should say a last word about the Eighth Amendment
itself.

We have submitted in our brief that there is no

acceptable mode of judicial construction that makes the death
penalty unconstitutional, despite the intentions of tbs
Framers, and in the face of the moral consensus of America,
and a moral consensus that has existed from Colonial Times
to this very day.
Now, the petitioner's counsel attempts to explain
that it's not a real moral consensus, that if people understood

58
it better# they wouldn't believe it„
But that may or may not be true.
understand it fairly well# I think,,

The Legislatures

They debated it# and they

have decided it, and they have come down# in the majority of
cases, saying that the death penalty is necessary for some
purposes.
This case is merely the latest in a series of cases
in which the opponents of the death penalty have attempted
to get this Court to males a political judgment that the
political branches of the State and federal governments
have been unwilling to give them.
QUESTIONs

Of course, in this particular case,

Mr. Bork, Mr. Fowler was not sentenced to death under any
decision that any Legislature made.
MR. BORK:

We point out in our brief, Mr. Justice

Stewart# that that would

seem to be a troublesome factor

here, but we thought that was an argument for the petitioner
to make and for North Carolina to answer.
QUESTION:

Yes.

But in this case, I wonder if

it*s your argument to make that this is a legislative
decision, when very clearly it was not.
MR. BORK:
but I hesitate to
to speak to that.
that’s

an

I think it is a legislative decision,
I wish North Carolina had an opportunity
I hate to bring it up myself.

I think

argument that should have been advanced by

in

59

the brief by petitioner, and should have been answered by
North Carolina.
And I feel quite awkward speaking to it? in that
circumstance.

But I think that, as the whole thrust of our

argument, one must admit is that it is a legislative determina­
tion? under the Constitution.
QUESTION :

At least you would be making that

argument in the next case, where we're talking about a new
statuta passed since Furmana
HR. 30RK j
correct.

That, is quite correct.

That is quite

This statute —QUESTION;

In other words, if this were a legislative

decision, you would be backing it up as a legislative decision?
MR. BORKt

That is quite correct.

That is what. —

QUESTION:

But the fact is it wasn’t.

MR. DORK:

The fact is it wasn’t, and, as I said

at the outset, we are not concerned — it is not the interest
of the United States to discuss the particular aspects of this
case? we are concerned merely with the general proposition
about the possibility of constitutional capital punishment
laws.
And for that reason I once more — the government
asks the Court to preserve the possibility of constitutional
capital punishment laws, which the States and the federal
government believe they need.

60

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr.. Amsterdam, you

have about 14 minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY G„ AMSTERDAM, ESQ. f
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. AMSTERDAM:

Thank you, Mr„ Chief Justice0

Let me address, if the Court will indulge me, in
more than my usual level of incoherence, let me address several
points that have come up without any real connection, in
terms of positions taken by opposing counsel and questions
asked by the Court.
First, I’d like to deal with questions of North
Carolina law, in which our view of North Carolina law was,
I believe,

were unrechallenged.
Although not previously cited, I have looked up

?

tlxe ThurmidgQ case, which counsel for North Carolina cited,
in 250 N.C., beginning at page 616, for the proposition that
North Carolina exercised judicial control over solicitors.
The question in the case is whether or not a
solicitor can constitutionally be given the power to issue
a warrant, a question which the North Carolina Supreme
Court answers, I should add, inconsistently with Coolidon
?
and with Shadwick; but, nevertheless, answers. And £h« only
thing that’s relevant in the case is a dictum which says
that in North Carolina if a solicitor chooses to enter a
nolle prosee with leave, he must have leave of tha court.

61
The nolle prosse with leave procedure of course is a
procedure that this Court is familiar with, in the wake of
?

Clopter v„ North Carolina.
It involves staying the case for reprosecution
latar»
That has nothing to do, at all, with the prosecutor’s
power to bring a first-degree nmrder indicted defendant to
trial only on second-degree, and therefore we stand on the
cases cited in our brief at page 48, principally the Rhyne and
Allen cases, that make it very clear that a prosecutor has
unbroad, uncontrollable and unreviewable discretion to charge
first or second* degree nmrder on a capital indictments
Secondly, the question asked with regard to race
and the death penalty in North Carolina6 I
several things0

would point out

First of all, the racial breakdown of the

47 people condemned to death under Waddell is not 50/50 j
two-thirds are non-white»
Secondly, consistent studies of racial discrimination
in capital sentencing have been addressed to North Carolina
and have been addressed to North Carolina under the mandatory
system which was in effect before 1949, and has been restored
by Waddell and the Garfinkel and Johnson studies, which are
cited at page 136, Note 226 of our brief, show that racial
discrimination under Waddell is no accident, that it has
always been true in North Carolina»

62

No* 3, w© have been called on the question of
burden of proof in North Carolina law, and where it lies,
I direct the court*s attention to page 74 of the jury charge
in this case, with regard to the question of whether in fact
the prosecutor has the burden of proof that remains with it
throughout the trial "when it is admitted or established by
the evidence that the defendant intentionally killed the
deceased with a deadly weapon, the law raises two presumptions
against the defendants

First, that the killing was unlawful*

second, that it was dona with malice»

And an unlawful

killing with malic© is murder in the second degree,"
"Where those facts are proven, that is an inten»
tional killing with a deadly weapon, the burden then rests
upon the defendant to establish facts which would mitigate
the offense to manslaughter or justify it all together
This burden on the defendant is not to prove those facts
beyond a reasonable doubt but simply to the satisfaction
of the jury unless they arise out of evidence from the State»"
Et cetera»
And on the next page, 76, "To justify a killing by
reason of self-defense the defendant must satisfy you of
four things:" — first, second, third, "the defendant must
satisfy you”? fourth, "the defendant must satisfy you".
Our statement of the burden of proof is perfectly
correct»

I believe that all of our statements on the

63

North Carolina law are in fact quite correct,,
Now, if I may then pass to the government’s broader
and larger argument»
Although the government purports to calling the
question what the government regards as empirical propositions
underlying Furman, what the government is doing is arguing
Furman too late,
Because they are not empirical propositions, they
are observations made by the Court as the operation of a system
under which 41 States of the United States then having death
penalty by legislation had seen it dwindling in the actual
administration of the death penalty, from 199 executions in
the year 1935 down to an average of 17 during the 1960fs, and
finally to 15 and 7 ana

2

and 1.

That development under which the people of the
United States, speaking through their juries, not to the
•v

abstract question of whether or not there should be on the
statute books cm authorization of the death penalty, but
whether it should be applied to particular defendants, have
spoken eloquently.
Th@ death penalty is a penalty which is tolerated
only because it is applied infrequently, it is a penalty
which is tolerated only because it is applied discriminatorily
to racial minorities and to the poor.
The government has said that the discretion under

54
which this happens is not a detect in the system, it is the
genius of the system,.
Of course, when you regard something as a genius
or as a defect depends on whether you're standing at the
long end of the stick or the short end of the stick»
Charles Black of the Yale Law School made this
point very strikingly in his recent book on the death
penalty, titled, appropriately "The Inevitability of Caprice
and Mistake".

He said that a yes answer to the question

whether the defendant shall live or die, given by a jury,
lik« the decision of the prosecutor to accept the guilty
plea, in the plea bargaining process, sounds good»
Somebody -escapes death»
The trouble is that if you turn the coin around,
somebody else suffers death, because the jury did not find
him guilty of a lesser offense rather than the capital charge.
And if the jury’s milder verdict may be a function
of its sympathies, then its sterner verdict, by inevitable
logic, may be a function of its lack of sympathy*
In short, the defects in the system are not
accidental, they are endemic»

They are not controllable

under the equal protection clause, because no more than the
governor’s decision, a decision of particular juries in
particular cases, exhibits no sufficient regularity so that
one can even base an equal protection claim.

65
Justice of this Court are quite familiar with
attempts to prove racial discrimination,,

I think that

probably, although it can’t be proved for particular counting,
perhaps even a particular State, perhaps in the hard way in
which facts have to be proved to establish equal protection
claims, it could never be proved*
The reason it can’t be is not because there's no
discrimination. The reason that it can't be is because there
is nor regularity sufficient to give you a base line to
show discrimination*

And that brings me to where I'd like to

conclude, which is that the government's argument that in
the administration of criminal justice in general, and in the
administration of capital justice in particular, discretion
is endemic? that there's always room for arbitrariness*
Explains the other aspect of the government's
position as to why Legislatures are willing to have a death
penalty*

Legislatures are not fools*

They are perfectly aware

thatthe very discretion which we have been talking about is
3b discretion with which the death penalty is going to be
administered.

And whether they have, like many States "«if

you look at the amicus brief of the State of Utah , for example,
where the Legislature has set standards, one of which is "any
other mitigating circumstance", which allot/ juries to pass up
the death penalty, or whether the State of California, if you
look at its amicus brief, it purports to have mandatory

66

categories for what the amicus brief doesn't tell you is
about Penal Code Section llr. 81.7 in California, which
allows a trial judge to set aside the death penalty in
any case.
Or whether you look at the North Carolina procedure
or the procedure under the Federal Hijacking statute, which
the government puts forward, I take it, as a model of a
statute that can be administered even-handedly.
Of course, if you look at the Federal Hijacking
statute, what you find is that an aggravating circumstance
that allows imposition of the death penalty i3 that the
defendant committed or attempted to commit the offense in an
especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner»
And the previous section which is an aggravating
circumstance, and this is for aircraft piracy, is that in
the commission of the offense the defendant knowingly created
a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the
victim.
Very hard to imagine aircraft piracy that doesn't
do tli at 0
Legislatures are not fools»
is going on.

They know exactly what

They are aware, with statutes of all of these

sorts, administered through the procedures that have becomo
commonplace by centuries of administration of this penalty,
unequaled, that the doath penalty will be administered

67
arbitrarily, that it will not fall, that it will be a verdict
from all but immune and disfavored few, public acceptance of
the death penalty is bought at that price.
And our position before this Court is simply that
that is too great a price under -the Eighth Amendment.
That the very purpose of the Eighth Amendment is to insist
that penalties not be inflicted on an unusual few that will
not be inflicted, even-handedly and regularly, on some
decent proportion of the people that commit the crimes.
And any penalty which buys its public acceptability, which
buys its acceptance from that kind of administration, is a
cruel and unusual punishment.
MR.CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:27 o'clock, p.m., the case in
the above-entitled matter; was submitted. ]
