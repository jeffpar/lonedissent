We will hear arguments

Mr, Morrison, you may proceed whenever you're ready»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN B» MORRISON, ESQ»,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MORRISON:

Mr, Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
In early 1962, the Committee on Economics of Law
Practice of the Virginia State Bar issued its report on
minimum fees.
The opening sentence of that report neatly summarizes
its intent and sets the background against which the activities
of the respondents must be judged»

And I quotes

"The lawyers have slowly, but surely, been
committing economic suicide as a profession."
The remedy suggested by the State Bar, minimum fee
schedules to be adopted by the local bars in the State,
patterned on the suggested schedule, contained in the State
Bar’s own fee report»
Shortly thereafter, the Respondent, Fairfax County
Bar Association, effective May 1, 1962, adopted its own fee
schedule for the first time, essentially the same fee
schedule as that suggested in the State Bar's report.
That fee schedule Continued in effect, unchanged,

4
for a period of seven years, until the Virginia State Bar,
once again, issued another fee report by a similar committee
as the one that issued the first one»

This report reflected,

and I quote, "a general scaling up of fees,”
The report indicated it was necessary because of
escalating costs and the spiraling increase in the cost of
living.
The committee acknowledged that there were substantial
differences between some of the old schedules and the new
fees for title examinations, which are the services
particularly at issue in this case.
The title examination charge went to one percent of
the purchase price of the home, up to $50,000? and a half of
one percent thereafter.
We can read through the minimum fee schedule reports
of the State Bar, and the minimum fee schedules of the Fairfax
Bar in vain to find a single reference to any protection of the
public interest or the promotion of quality legal services at
a reasonable cost.
But there are indications of what these fee schedules
and reports were intended to do.
In the 1962 Report the State Bar says that fee
schedules should be promulgated because it is in the best interest
of the Virginia State Bar,
And in 1969 the Fairfax Report noted that the fee

5
will enhance the prestige of the State Bar,
But the State Bar here was not content merely to
publish its own fee reports and to allow the local bar
associations to publish their own fee schedules.

It wanted

to put some teeth behind these fee schedules# to be sure that
they would be followed»
And so it issued two ethical opinions:
and one in 1971,

one in I960

Opinions numbered 98 and 170„

And# in substance# these two fee opinions 'state
that any attorney in Virginia who habitually charges less
than the minimum fee schedule amount shall be presumed to have
acted unethically# and can be subject to discipline on pro­
ceedings brought by the Virginia State Bar in the State courts
Of Virginia.
QUESTION:

Does this record show whether any such

disciplinary proceedings have ever been embarked on —
MR. MORRISON:

It does# Your Honor# and it suggests#

Mr. Chief Justice# that there have never been any disciplinary
proceedings brought for that very reason.
However# I think it’s also important to note that
the record does show two other factors in that regard:
No. 1, one of the attorneys to whom the Goldfarbs
wrote suggested in his response to their letter about what
kind of fees they could expect to pay# that he felt that he
was ethically required to adhere to the schedule; and it was

6

also stipulated between the parties that the existence of these
two opinions was a substantial influencing factor in the
adherence found by the district court to the fee schedules in
Northern Virginia»
QUESTION!

Is there any indication in that stipula­

tion or in any of the findings of the district court as to
whether this adherence carae about because of a fear of
disciplinary action, or because of a desire to persuade the
client that the fee had to be charge for pecuniary motives?
MR» MORRISON*
directly responds.

I don't think there*s anything that

I would refer to stipulation No. 20, which

is in Petitioner's appendix at page — to the petition for
writ of certiorari, at page IS, and I think that that about
says what could be found and agreed upon.

I don't think there's

anything further in the findings with regard to that, Mr,
Justice Rehnquist,
In any event, it is no small wonder, based upon this
history -QUESTION:

Excuse me, Mr, Morrison,

MR. MORRISON:

at what page?

That's page 19 in the Appendix to the

Petition for Writ of Certiorari.
QUESTION*
QUESTION:

Oh, the Petition, I'm sorry.
What color?

MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

Blue.

Thank you

7
QUESTION:

It isn't in the regular Appendix —

MR. MORRISON:

No, Your Honor, that was one of the

findings of fact that was included in the trial court's
opinion.

Sorry, it was presented in connection with our

petition, and was therefore not required to be reproduced.
QUESTION:

That's finding 20, is it?

Or stipulation 20?
MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

That is right,

Yes, thank you.

MR. MORRISON:

It is no small wonder that the

Goldfarbs were unable to find a lawyer who would char ere them
less than the minimum fee for title examination for their
home,

They indeed wrote 36 letters to attorneys in Northern

Virginia who had expressed interest in real estate practice
work.

They received 19 replies.

None of which indicated a

willingness to charge less, and in almost every case the
reply was something to the effect that "the fee is established
by the Fairfax County Bar Association", or "I know of none of
my brethren who would charge any less, and I feel that I am
ethically required to adhere to those charges."
QUESTION:

I take it you're asserting that the

Virginia State Bar effectively enforced the minimum fee,
is that it?
MR. MORRISON:

That is correct.

We assert that the

Virginia State Bar has two very important roles in this matter.

0

First, the promulgation of the fee reports in 1962,
which got the ball rolling in Northern Virginia, and then in
1969 when they effectuated the revision of the fee suggestion.
And I might point out, Your Honor, that in 1969 the
increase in the minimum fee for title examination alone was an
increase of 67 percent,
QUESTIONS So the Virginia State Bar, you are saying,
invited local bar associations to promulgate minimum fees, and
then enforced them through the ethical mandates?
MR, MORRISON:

Precisely.

Indeed, I would say

beyond inviting, they suggested,recommended that the local bar
QUESTION:

Well, do you suggest that the Virginia

State Bar was acting outside the scope of its authority under
the Virginia law?
MR, MORRISON:

I would say, Your Honor, that f-he

Virginia Bar has been given the authority to issue ethical
opinions by the State Court of Virginia»

There is nothing any

place that indicates that they were ever specifically given the
authority to publish fee schedules or fee reports or ethica.!
opinions enforcing minimum fee schedules,
QUESTION:

So you're suggesting, then, that there

isn't any clear authority in the Virginia lav;, you are saying*,/
for that?
MR. MORRISON:

I would say that's correct, Your

Honor; but that even if there were authority under Virginia

9
law, that is, we in this case are not, I don’t believe,
deciding a question of whether the issuance of these reports
is somehow a violation of Virginia law.

Although in the

Parker v. Brown area it does become of some relevance, and
I'm not trying to avoid that question.
QUESTION:
I don't think.

Yes, well, you can't have it both ways,

You can't say that — you can't say that the

State Bar was adopting and enforcing fee schedules, and then
turn around and say that it wasn't really doing anything
official.
As long as you ~~ unless you say that it just
wasn't an administrative agency of the State*
MR. MORRISON: Well, we do say that it was an
administrative agency of the State for only very limited
purposes.

The statute upon which the State bar relies,

Section 54-49 of the Virginia Code, says that the Virginia
State Bar has the authority to "act as an administrative
agency".
QUESTION:

So you're saying that it was acting

outside the clear scope of its authority as far as fee
schedules were concerned?
MR. MORRISON:

That’s right, Your Honor.

But I

would say that even if we decided as a matter of state law
that the authority was so broad to the Virginia State Bar
that there was nothing that prohibited the State Bar from

10

issuing fee reports or these ethical opinions, that under this
Court’s decision in Parker vs. Brown, that that would not be
sufficient to create an antitrust exemption, that there needs
to be more, and that, as we’ll show later on, that they have
not met those tests here.
As I say, I have discussed these matters relating to
the importance of the Virginia State Bar because two of the
judges in this case, the district court judge and the dissenting
judge in the Court of Appeals, both suggested that the State
Bar was immune because of what they termed the State- Bar's
minor role.
I think that any realistic assessment of this record
inevitably reaches the conclusion that the State Bar was, if
not the prime mover, certainly a co-equal partner in this
entire matter,
QUESTION:

That is, by Opinions 98 and 170, in 1962

and 1968, and further by being a brooding omnipresence that
threatened to enforce these, as -— on the basis of violation
of ethics if there were a violation of these minimum standards?
is that it?
MR, MORRISON:

And further the issuance of the two

fee reports.

You remember in 1962 the State Bar issued the

fee report.

That was the first time that one was issued in

Northern Virginia,

The fee schedule followed that, and —

QUESTION: The fee report had to do with a comparative

1
study of doctors' and lawyers' incomes and so on? is that it?
MR„ MORRISON:

Only very slightly, Your Honor.

Most of it was a recommendation to the local bar associations
to adopt fee schedules and contained in that recommendation
was not simply the suggestion to go out and figure out your
own fee schedule, but these were the fees that you ought to
charge? andf indeed, the fees that were actually contained in
the Fairfax schedule and in the other schedules were virtually
identical in both '62 and again in '69, when the scaling up
took place*
So that that’s a very important factor in moving
ahead of the advent of fee schedules in Northern Virginia.
QUESTION:

Now, were there, in fact, disciplinary

proceedings initiated against people who charged less than
this minimum fee schedule?
MR* MORRISON:
QUESTION:

Never?

MR, MORRISON:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.

Never.

I mean never in so far as this record

goes, in Virginia.
MR. MORRISON:

The State Bar has so represented,

and we are unaware of any cases.

It, of course, being to the

economic advantage to an attorney if the fee schedules,
working across the board effectively, vrhere none of his brethren
are going to undercut him? there is very little economic

12

incentive to violate it»
But, in any event, it ha3 not been violated.
QUESTION: And the ethical violation would be soliciting
business — would it be on that theory?
MR. MORRISON:

That is on that general theory,

although there needn’t be a specific requirement of solicita­
tion in the sense that a lawyer need not advertise or go out
and tell people that he does — that he —
QUESTION:

But if he undercuts other lawyers, —

MR. MORRISON:

But if he consistently undercuts,

if he charges three-quarters of a percent of the purchase
price, or makes the break at 25 instead of 50 thousand dollars?
that's considered unethical.

Or if he charges on the basis of

time, or the value of the services, —
QUESTION:

That fact alone would support disciplinary

action?
MR, MORRISON:
QUESTION:

That is precisely correct.

But on the theory of solicitation of

business, is that it?
MR, MORRISON:

In the general —

on that general

theory, yes, Your Honor.
Yes, sir.

That fact alone would be sufficient.

This of course is different from the American Bar
Association's position.
QUESTION:
‘.Vr -

Some added there.

13
MR* MORRISON:

That’s right.

more, there must be more.

But that it must be

It can be taken into account as a

factor, but it’s not sufficient in and of itself.
QUESTION:

Do

you think there’s a general public

interest factor, call it social interest, in not having a
system which permits lawyers to charge, let us say, a straight
$15 for every title examination ■— fifteen, not fifty —
MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

— and then gradually get most of the,

ox' a great deal of the work, but for $15, obviously performing
shoddyprofessional work, as it would have to be*.
MR. MORRISON:

I ttfould certainly never counsel this

Court or anyone to adopt any sort of situation under which the
lawyers were required to charge any sort of minimal fee such
as that.

I would say that the lawyers should be left free to

determine the amount.
QUESTION:

But would that not be possible, a

possible consequence of no standards for fees?
MR. MORRISON:

I don’t think so, Your Honor.

There

are bars all around the country, for which there are no
minimum fee schedules.
Indeed, —*
QUESTION:

Minimum fee schedules have been dis­

appearing , have they not, over the country as a whole?
MR. MORRISON:

Yes, Your Honor.

14
Indeed, I would point out that during the course of
this proceeding the Arlington County Bar Association and the
City of Alexandria Bar Association withdrew their minimum fee
schedules in order to settle this case out; and, indeed, on the
16th day of September of this very year, while our petition for
a writ of certiorari was pending, the Fairfax County Bar
Association, the respondent in this case, withdrew its own
minimum fee schedule, thereby belying any notion that they are
necessary to insure the maintenance of ethical standards, and
to insure that attorneys do quality work*
I hope, Your Honor, that we can rely upon the members
of the bar by means other than minimum fee schedules not to do
shoddy work.

And that I would never suggest that we ought to

establish any kind of fee schedule, maximum, minimum or anything
else.

Those are matters to be left to the marketplace for

each individual attorney to decide what his services are worth
and what a reasonable fee ought to be.
QUESTION;

Wall, what if you*re just out of lavr school

and have hung up your shingle and somebody comes to you and asks
for a divorce.

How do you know what to charge them if you

don't have some guidance from somewhere?
HR, MORRISON;

Your Honor, I woxild say, the first tiling

I would do, before I hung up my shingle, is I would go around and
talk to my fellow members of the bar.
is the kind of rate they charge?

X would ask them what

There are courses these days

15
in law and economics, the bar may have an obligation to teach
lawyers, in some sense, when they are going out on their own,
how to figure out whether they're going to make enough money»
QUESTIONs Well, isn't that one purpose of at least
a suggested minimum fee schedule, is it's going to distill
the experience of other lawyers and say, This is about what we
get for it?
MR. MORRISON:

Your Honor, that may be a purpose,

but that would be a purpose in almost any other form of price
fixing. And we don't allow it in the antitrust laws.

And I

think Congress wisely said, No, that's not what we*re going to
permit.
QUESTION: Rut it would be all right for a lawyer to
go out and talk to ten other lawyers and see what they were
charging, and charge the same thing himself?
MR. MORRISON:
reasonable fee.

If he felt that was a fair, just and

Absolutely, Your Honor.

Indeed, I would say

the First Amendment would compel the conclusion that the
State could not prohibit a lawyer from discussing that.
QUESTION:

But haven’t corporations gotten in

trouble doing just that?
[Laughter. ]
MR. MORRISON:

If they've asked them what they in

fact have charged, Your Honor, with respect to a particular
matter, perhaps so? that if they're asking, What are you

16
/sic/

charging for a particular price?
But to find out what is the going rate on divorces,
I would say that that certainly ought not to be, even under
the reasoning of this Court’s decision in Container Corporation,
that that would not be prohibited from finding out that general
kind of pricing information, for someone who is just starting
out in the business*
QUESTIONs

I realize you don’t have Very much time,

but are you going to refer at all to the possible impact of
this case, depending on its outcome, on group prepaid legal
services?
MR. MORRISONs
concern to me personally.

Your Honor, that is a matter of great
I have been working quite closely

with a number of organizations in that area, and I would think
that this case — that the favorable outcome in this case would
aid the development of prepaid legal services, that the bar
could properly do many things in the prepaid area»

Although

the Justice Department’s position with respect to prepaid
legal services, under bar-established programs, under which the
bar sets all the fees, without any kind of consumer input at
all, without any statutory authority or court authority to
promulgate fees, without any kind of openness in the process,
may not be sufficiently strong to qualify under Parker-Brown
exemption.
But those matters can be cured.

And I would have to,

17
Your Honor, look at the specifics of a particular prepaid
legal services program*
Those programs in which, for instance, a group of
consumers entered into an agreement with a law firm to provide
services at a given fee would be no different than any
corporation or any other entity providing services.
QUESTION:

Mr. Morrison, did the Fairfax Bar make

any statement when they withdrew their fee schedule recently?
MR, MORRISON;

There is, Your Honor, in its brief

in opposition to certiorari, there is a resolution, which is
their full statement, it's attached as Appendix, I believe
it's Appendix I in the brief from the Fairfax Bar, and that
is the only statement wa have in the record, Your Honor*
QUESTION: Does that statement contain a justifica­
tion for their action?
MR, MORRISON;

I wouldn't want to characterise it

one way or the other, Your Honor,
QUESTION:

I'll ask the other side,

MR* MORRISON:

Thank you, Your Honor*

The Court of Appeals below, the majority, relied
very heavily on the so-called learned profession exemption
to the antitrust laws, in finding immunity for the bar, for
these activities.
We believe that that reliance was misplaced, and that
the proper focus was on —• should have been on this Court's

18

decision in United states v, American Medical Association»
In that case, this Court held that it was inmaterial
what the professions of the defendants were who were charged
with that criminal conspiracy.

Provided that the effect and

purpose of that restraint was to restrain the trade of group
health.
The defendants there were the Medical Society and
21 doctors, who opposed the establishment of prepaid medical
services, a matter not dissimilar to prepaid legal services,
about which the Chief Justice just asked me.
And the medical societies there issued rulings which
said' that it was unethical for a lawyer —■ excuse me, for a
doctor to work for Group Health, and that it was unethical
for another doctor to consult with that doctor, or is unethical
for a hospital to — and they threatened boycotts of hospitals
that cooperated.

And the result of this was, of course, a

serious impairment of the proposal to deliver prepaid medical
services to the workers in that particular case.
In our viet/, the Court's holding there that the
profession was immaterial requires a rejection of the attempt
of the bar here to spread an ethical umbrella over its
activities and to insulate it from the true effects which is,
as it was there, to deprive consumers of the opportunity for
the free market.
In AMA, this Court said that a conspiracy allegedly

19

aimed at restraining or destroying competition or limiting
the free availability of medical services violated the Sherman
Act.

And it surely does here, also.
I want to turn, if I may, to the alternative basis

upon which the bar can escape *— if escape is the proper word
from the structures of the Sherman Act, for those truly
legitimate activities which the bar has and which do need to
be carried forward.
Now, if the bar can establish under Parker that there
has been State action and that the State has intended to
replace competition
QUESTION:

Just, if I may, before you get into that,

I want to be sure I understand your previous point, that you
say that there may be a so-called learned profession exemption,
but we need not decide that here because if the exemption
exists it has to do with the pinch not with the squeeze —
to use Justice Jackson's metaphor — and that here the pinch
was on the public.
MR. MORRISONi

That's certainly true, Your Honor,

and to the extent to which the special status of the bar becomes
relevant, of course, it is in the rule of reason cases where,
like every other characteristic of any business or industry,
we certainly must look to the obligations of that industry and
its peculiarities.
QUESTION:

That people in the learned profession,

20

let's say you had three or four Ph.D„'s and a couple of
Doctors of Divinity, and maybe a dentist and an M.D., all members
of learned professions, but that they could conspire to violate
the antitrust laws if the effect of that were on the general
public.

Is that it?
MR. MORRISON:

That's correct.

That's correct,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

But, on the other hand, if the effect

were wholly within a Divinity school or a university graduate
school, there might be a learned profession exception? is that
it?
MR, MORRISON:

I gave an example in my brief, Your

Honor, of lawyers agreeing that sixty years is an appropriate
time for title examination,to go back sixty years will be
considered prima facie reasonable, in terms of what's
required.
Now, there may be a restraint.

I would -think it

would be satisfied under the rule of reason.

But the restraint

there would be simply upon the internal workings of the
professions, and while there might be some tangential effect
on the public in the long run, it would be very small and
would probably be protected.
QUESTION:
MR. MORRISON:

at about agreements not to advertise?
Your Honor, that of course is not the

very case we have before us.

We have price fixing, and —

21
however, I would say, Your Honor, that if in the commercial
context the per se rule applies in that case, then I would
say that the bar, to escape Sherman Act liability, would have
to come either under Parkar-Hrown directly under the
authority to regulate, or under a specific State statute.
QUESTION:
per se.

I know.

You said "if” it comes under

Now, what do you think about that?
MR. MORRISON:

Your Honor, I’ve read the case cited

by the American Bar Association,

and if I had to extrapolate,

I would say that that probably is a per se violation.

There

has been no decision, specifically of this Court, that reached
the precise question.

But if I had to give my opinion, and

were advising a client, I would say:

Yes, it is a per se

violation.
QUESTION:

How about a rule -- how about agreements

not to solicit otherwise than advertising?
MR. MORRISON:

I would say, Your Honor, that it is
i

under the same rule, and that if the bar needs an exemption,
there are two ways that the bar can get an exemption.

Under

Parker--Drown, where there is meaningful State regulation,
where there’s an important State end to be achieved by that,
I'm prepared to say that that can be achieved,
QUESTION;

But you

would say if there’s a specific

State statute that forbade solicitation.
MRj MORRISON:

That's righto

Where the State has

22

made a decision to —
QUESTION:

Well# there youTd have pure Parker v,

Brown# wouldn’t you?
MR» MORRISON;

Exactly, Your Honor»

Exactly,

Or if Congress — as Congress has so often done for
other business problems, labor unions, the airlines, fair trade
laws, there are a whole raft of areas in which Congress has
said, No, competition is not the be-ail and end-all for every­
body, hot on a State-by-State basis but for everybody.

And

we want those situations to be covered by another rule.
With regard to Parker-Brown, I want to point out
several important things about Parker that are different„from
this particular case.
In Parker, first, there is a terribly important role
played by the State Agriculture Commission, who were all
appointed by the Governor, confirmed by the Senate of California,
one of them included the State Agriculture Director, and others
included consumers and handlers as well as growers.
Now, these individuals made tine key and essential
decisions in Parker,

There was no more way in which the State

could operate that program unless there was positive,
specific approval given by these individuals.
Moreover, there had to be beyond that a good deal, and
of this I speak of the specific factual findings that the program
for the particular industry was to be carried out in accordance

23

with tlie statutory scheme, and assurance against any form of
unreasonable profits, and then, after full hearings and full
determination, that competition ought to be replaced in that
particular instance by some other form of control in order to
preserve the agriculture wealth of the State.

That in that

case the Court, held, Yes, there was an exemption.
This was indeed action of the State.
We don’t have anything of that kind here.

The

real activities here were conducted by the State Bar,

None

of the committee who issued the fee schedules, fee reports,
wrote the ethical opinions, none of them was appointed by the
governor, confirmed by the State Senate, there were no
hearings, there were no factual findings, there was no kind of
procedural assurance that any kind of policy mandate from the
State of Virginia was being carried out.
There was, in short, a very different kind of situa­
tion than ws had in Parker-Brown.
The State Supreme Court, has done only two — taken
two actions which might conceivably be brought within -the
notion of an approval as in Parker;
No. 1, the Canons of Ethics, No. 12, which the State
Bar adopted verbatim in this regard from the ABA's Canons of
Ethics, indicated that in determining what a reasonable fee
was, it was proper to consider the customary fees in the area,
and that the customary fees in the areas included proper

24

refe rance to minimum fee schedules i

That's the one item.

Then in 1969 and *70, when the Canons of Ethics were
replaced by the Code of Professional Responsibility# that
language was taken out and the question of reasonable fees was
again included# and in Ethical Consideration 2-18# the American
Bar Association and

adopted by the Virginia State Bar —

the Virginia Supreme Court said that minimum fee schedules are
some guidance on what a reasonable fee is.
Now# that is a very different kind of approval than
was required in Parker-Brown»

There was no consideration by

the Virginia Supreme Court of either the Ethical Opinions,
the Fee Reports# or the Fee Schedules# and# most particularly#
there was no consideration of the numbers involved.
was a reasonable fee?

How much

Was there any assurance that the

consumers were not being unfairly abused by the fee schedules#
as there was in Parker? none of that took place

here.

And we suggest that that is a fatal flaw in the entire
manner by which the minimum fee schedule system operated in
Virginia.
Finally, as in Parker — unlike Parker, rather, there
are no statutes here which give’ an indication to the State Bar
or anyone else that these activities ought to be carried out
as a replacement for competition.
A careful statutory scheme was taking place in
Parker, a scheme fully consistent with the federal practice, and

25
indeed a scheme intended to preserve the agricultural wealth
of the state without unreasonable profits and, further,
without profits in a situation that once the schema went into
effect, t>e program was approved after these long hearings and
findings of fact that it no longer was optional, that it
became mandatory, and any person who didn't follow that scheme
for the growers of raisins in that case, was subject to
criminal prosecution.
Your Honor, it is clear that if all of the developers
in Reston, Virginia, and all the bankers in the area and the
neighboring areas, and all the real estate brokers and sellers
of title insurance had gotten together and published minimum
fee schedules, and that anyone could be disciplined for not
adhering to them, there can be little doubt that the Sherman
Act would have been violated.
The question before this Court is:

Are lawyers any

different, or do they have to meet the tests that everyone
else has to meet?
We suggest that the Court of Appeals below was in
error in reaching the contrary conclusion? and, accordingly,
we ask this Court to reversa,
Thank Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE HURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Solicitor General.
You'll have a few minutes before lunch.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK , ESQ„,
ON BEHALF OF TIIE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS
CURIAE , SUPPORTING PETITIONERS
MR, BORKx

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I was hoping that Mr, Morrison would, talk for two
more minutes, but —
[Laughter, 3
I should say that the United States supports the
petitioners here, and we believe that these minimum fee
schedules are, in fact, illegal per se under Section 1 of the
Sherman Act,
And I hope to spend my time primarily on the issues
known, somewhat inaccurately, as the learned profession exemption
and the State action exemption.
It is clear, I think, that Section 1 of the Sherman
Act applies to personal services, and it’s also clear that the
circulation of minimum price schedules for personal services,
even without an explicit agreement to adhere to them, would be
a violation of the per se rule against price-fixing, if the
respondents here were stenographers or violinists or cosmetol­
ogists or somebody else.
And the question we have is:

Why should not the per

se rule be applied to lawyers?
The answer is said to be the ethical responsibilities

27

of the bar* and while one my concede that the bar has strong
ethical responsibilities* and indeed the power to police those
violateions of their standards, one searches in vain for the
connection between professional ethics and price-fixing
for professional services.
At least one searches in vain for a connection that
leads to the conclusion that price-fixing is ethical»
The charging of a fee is the one place where the
lawyer and his client have an inescapable conflict of interest*
and it's rather mystifying why an agreement among lawyers to
pit their collective strength against the individual client*
so that the lawyers may win out in that conflict of* interest*
should be required as a matter of legal ethics»

ORAL ARGUMENT OF

ROBERT II. BORIC, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS

— Resumed

MR. BORK:

Mr. Chief Justice, ~~

QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, I don't mean to

infringe on your very short tine, but is somebody from your
side of the lectern going to discuss interstate commerce?
MR. BORK:
would.

He did not.

Well, we had hoped that Mr. Morrison
It seems to me perfectly clear in this

case that there is no problem with interstate commerce, or the
effect upon interstate commerce.
QUESTION:

Well, were these particular plaintiffs

no lender outside of Virginia?
MR. BORK:

Well, I don't think the plaintiffs have to

affect interstate commerce, it's the defendants that have to
affect interstate commerce to violate the Sherman Act.
And I think it's quite clear that the flow of mortgage
money —
QUESTION:

In the specific cases, or in the generality

of their law practices?
MR. BORK:

Well, I think that in this case the effect

29

upon interstate commerce, Mr, Chief Justice, is the particular
fees being charged on closings of real estate.
QUESTION:

For the particular people who are

plaintiffs?
MR. DORK:

The particular people who are plaintiffs

are people who purchased a home at a — and had a somewhat
inflated cost in the minimum fee schedule.

But it’s not

necessary that the plaintiffs be in interestate commerce, as
long as the violation affects interstate commerce.

And

I think under cases like the Employing Plasterers case,
and Burke vi, Ford, and so forth, where it is necessarily true
that the

and the law infers it, the law implies it, that

the flow of mortgage money into the State, for example, will
be diminished as the price rises.
That standard —
QUESTION:

Where do you get that —

MR. BORK:

— is as to how the interest law operates.

l

QUESTION:

Where do you get that legal inference

from?
MR. BORK:

A legal inference?

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR, BORK;

Well, I think it was first enunciated in

the Joint Traffic case in 1897 by Mr. Justice Peckham, when
he said that the restraint of trade was a lessening of the
flow of commerce, which could be infered from a rise in the

30

price.
QUESTION:

And that that same would carry over to

mortgage money into Northern Virginia?
MR. BORK:

Yes.

In the Emploving 'P1 asfce re r s' case

there — the Employing Latherers * case, around Chicago, I
believe, the Court inferred that the flow of building materials
into the area would be diminished as the prices were raised
artificially.

And that gives you the necessary effect upon

interstate commerce, I believe.
I think, in fact, that with these minimum fee
schedules here, there would be little difficulty in concluding
that the Sherman Act per se rule had been violated.

Indeed,

I think any other conclusion would be logically impossible
after — certainly after footnote 59 in the Socony-Vacuum case.
Nov;, this morning there was some — there's some
questions I'd like to respond to now, if I may.
The Chief Justice asked the question:

What about

the bar's responsibility with respect to a lawyer who charges
fees much too low and therefore necessarily does shoddy work.
I think there are two answers to that.
One is that in Sherman Act terms, in other contexts,
we never allow price-fixing on the ground that the product
will be made better if the price is higher.

We let the quality

and the price both be set by the market.
The second is, I think, that the bar —■

31
QUESTION:

Well, that nay be one thing for a box

of matches, and at least some people have thought in the past,
including Justice Holmes and others, that that was perhaps a
different thing when it came to -the services of professional
people,
MR. I50RK:

Well, I think the bar, Mr. Chief

Justice, has perfect authority to discipline for shoddy work,
which deprives the client of effective legal representation.
That seems to ne different than disciplining for charging too
low a price.

I have no problem with the discipline for not

behaving as a professional man should, in giving the proper
legal services,
QUESTION:

Is there much evidence that that has

MR. BORK:

I — across idie country?

been done?
As a matter

of fact,
QUESTION;
MR. BORIC:

Anywhere.
— professional discipline is perhaps,

has not been* as effective as it should be.

But I think now

we're discussing — and in this case there's been no discipline
for cutting fees.
I think we’re discussing now conceptually what it is
that justifies a price-fixing agreement.

I don’t think the

fear of shoddy services or shoddy work and shoddy products,
under the antitrust laws, does; and I think the bar, if it

32

wishes to guard

against that, should guard against the provision

of shoddy services rather than the price.
The second question was asked by Hr. Justice
Rehnquist, who asked if this minimum fee schedule did not pro­
vide information to a young lawyer, to other lawyers, about
what prices were current.

I'm sure it does, but fee or price

schedules have been defended on that ground before, and that
argument has never succeeded.

You don’t set the price to

provide information.
Trade association cases indicate that if you wish to
provide information about the range of prices currently being
charged in an area, you may? but that is a far different tiling
from setting the price which the man must charge.
And, thirdly, there was the question about whether
or not — several questions about whether or not there had been
enforcement by the bar in disciplining people for charging low
prices, or whether there was the threat of it.
The usual antitrust rule is that the circulation of
the price which is to be charged is sufficient for a violation of
the Sherman Act, and that there need not be a mechanism or a
threat of compulsion behind that.
For example, the Hationwide Tr ai 1 er System case,
*

which

I think part of which was summarily affirmed in this

Court — holds that,
I think the real problem in this case is really the

33

slippery slope argument, and that is the fear expressed by
various bar associations that any application of a per se
rule to any practice of the legal profession endangers all
ethical regulations of the profession»
is groundless.

And I think that fear

I think there is room for legitimate regulation

of professional behavior.
Now, the per se rules

there are at least four

defenses to an attempt to apply it,
applies here»

I don't think any of them

Dut any of them may apply in other cases.

The first one, of course, is simply the defense that
the restraint, whatever it is, is ancillary to a legitimate
joint venture.
And that kind of an argument, of course, justifies
restraints within a law firm, within an economic unit, to make
it more efficient.
But, as recognized ever since Addison Pipe and Steel,
when Judge Taft explicated that branch of the antitrust law;
but there is here no economic integration between the entire
bar, no joint venture to which the restraint could be
ancillary.
The second offense is State action within the meaning
°f Parker yv Brown.

That defense is not available here,

because the fee schedules here were not imposed by the
Virginia Legislature, nor by any State agency charged by the
Legislature with the setting of fees

34

The Supreme Court's — Virginia Supreme Court's
minimal relationship to fee schedulas is not enough to satisfy
Parker y„ Brown,

The Court hasn't really proved or commanded

these schedules? and mere silence isn't enough*

Soma affirma-"

tive supervision? extensive affirmative supervision, and
affirmative State policy 1 think are required by Parker v,
grown.
And, secondly, although we need -QUESTION:

Well, what if

what about a State

Supreme Court providing an ethical standard that indicates that
ethical conduct or reasonable fees should take into account
fee schedules as an element?
MR, BORK:

You mean in the terms of State action, Mr,

Justice White?
QUESTION:

Yes,

At least you would think the Supreme Court, which is
an agency of the State, didn't disapprove of fee schedules, and,
as a matter of fact, invited lawyers to pay some attention to
them,
MR. BORK:

I think the —- in this case, I think

Canon 12 says that, of the factors that may be considered are
customary fees which may not be fee schedules, I think may be
the market range of fees.

But, that aside, perhaps I can

answer your question best by moving to the case where a State
Supreme Court does put out a fee schedule and says:

Abide by

35

it as a matter of ethics.
I have severe doubt that that would be a valid fee
schedule, and that the Sherman Act would not apply to people
who followed it, for following for a variety of reasons.
One is that that Court, although it may have the
power to regulate ethics, clearly cannot call anything ethics
that it wishes to? it could not say, You may not pay a
secretary more than $6,000 a year,
QUESTION:

But if a State statute said you may —

you may impose fee schedules if you want to, Mr* Supreme Court?
and the Supreme Court did,
MR. BORK:

Oh, well, I think in that case we get

very close to Parker v, Brown, and if you have a legislative
determination that the Supreme Court is to supervise fees,
and the Supreme Court does supervise fees, then I think we
have a real Parker-Brown question,
QUESTION:

But there's nothing close to that here,

you say?
MR. BORK:
QUESTION:

Nothing close to that at all.
Well, Mr, Solicitor General, suppose you

have under State constitutional system, where the Legislature
can't do this sort of thing but the Court may?
MR. BORK:

Oh, well, I think it

in part, that

depends upon the nature of the form of government.

In

Virginia we happen to have the separation of powers specified

36
in the Constitution, much like the United States Constitution,
so that I don't think the problem arises.
There may be States where a Court has legislative
authority, and if it does by the State Constitution have legis“
lative authority, then we have a very different question.
questions

If it sets fees.,

MR. BORK;

If it sets fees, or if it does anything

else that is —
QUESTION: But you suggest that no State agency here
has really set a fee, anyway, in this case.
MR*
* DORK:

No, the State agency, I don't believe,

has set a fee in this case.
QUESTION:

Because, on this problem, Lathrop vy

Donohue involved a State Supreme Court that did have legislative
authority.

There the creation of an integrated bar.
MR. BORK:

Yes, I quite agree.

As to whether or not

it is the State policy, when a Court does it, the question must
be answered by reference to whether or not the Court has, under
State law, the authority to do that.
*

But 1 wanted to say that there is — because of time
I will move to the last point, which answers the fears rather
than the — rather than — answer the fears in this case; and
that is this :
When the Sherman Act was passed, I think nobody who
framed it had any idea that it was going to strike at the core

37

of the bar’s ability to regulate itself as to professional
ethical conduct, and therefore I -think it would be quite wrong
to strike at that kind of self-regulation.
suggest

And I don’t

for example, I don’t think there's any doubt that

the bar association under the Sherman Act has the power to
discipline a member for supporting perjury, or for converting
a client’s funds.

Maybe businessmen couldn't discipline their

rivals in this way, I think the bar can, for traditional and
historical reasons.
QUESTION: Well, how about an agreement not to
advertise?
MR. BORK:

I think the agreement not to advertise

becomes between the examples I just gave and the straight
price-fixing, which we have here.
QUESTION: So do X, that’s the reason I asked the
question.
MR. BORK:

Yes, sir,

[Laughter. 3
MR. BORK:

And to say that this is per se illegal,

I think is not to say that advertising is; and frankly I think
the question of the relationship of advertising or the ban
upon it to the lav/yers, to the legal profession's professional
and ethical obligation, is a question that would have to be
decided on the full record.

I just don't know all the

functions that a ban on advertising may serve in this profession.

38

And I think to decide this case is not to decide that
case,
QUESTIONj And the sane goes for solicitation?
MRo BORK:

I believe so.

Yes, Nr. Justice White,

I don’t think one can say that lowering your price
is a method of solicitation, and therefore unethical.

That is

merely to say that price competition is unethical.
One night equally say that providing better services
for the same price is a way of soliciting business, and is
therefore unethical.
I hope one would not say that? but one night, on the
sane rationale.
QUESTION:

It would be a little hard to communicate

that without advertising, wouldn’t it?
MR. BORKs

Well, I think most — you nean the better

services, Mr. Chief Justice?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. BORK:

I think, —

QUESTION:

Except as it passes by word of mouth on a

man's reputation.
MR. BORIC:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Or a woman's reputation.

QUESTION:

Would an agreement by bankers as respects

It would be.

But I trust that —

the interest on purchasing a home be covered by the Act?
MR. BORKV

The Sherman Act?

I certainly think it

39

would, Mr. Justice Douglas»

Yes, it would.

And I think — 1

see no reason in this context why the lawyer's participation
in that same process should be governed differently.
1 think we knw enough, this Court over the years has
worked out the rules about price-fixing, and there is no
occasion here to jettison those rules just because lawyers
rather than cosmetologists or somebody else are involved.
To decide this case, X

stress, does not decide other issues

of professional obligation»
So the government asks that the judgment of the
Court of Appeals be reversed in order to vindicate the Sherman
Act; and indeed, I think that would help to vindicate the
legal profession.
Thank you,
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER!

Mr* Booker, you may

proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEWIS T. BOOKER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT FAIRFAX COUNTY
BAR ASSOCIATION
MR. BOOKER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
We submit there are five issues here for this Court’s
determination today, and the very first one is the one Mr.
Justics Rehnquist just turned to:

Is any interstate commerce

involved here in the first place?

Is there, indeed, any

40

basis for jurisdiction?"

Has there in the trial court and is

there here?
Secondly, is there any exemption or exclusion of the
practice of law, because of the so-called learned profession
decisions over the years?
Third, is the Virginia State Bar and the State of
Virginia so intimately involved in the promulgation of advisory
fee schedules that in fact the Parker

Brown doctrine is

applicable to the fees promulgated evern by voluntary local
bar associations, such as the Fairfax County Bar Association?
Fourth, if advisory fee schedules be determined to be
violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, in fact should per
se treatment foe accorded them?
And, finally, if the Fourth Circuit was wrong in its
decision below, should any adverse decision by this Court be
applied prospectively only or should it be applied retroactively?
The nature of this transaction is simplicity itself.
Residents of Virginia, who' liked Virginia, and who wanted to
purchase another home in Virginia, went to Reston, Virginia,
and there purchased a home and had the title to that home
examined by a Virginia attorney who never left his home county
to go from his office to the Clerk’s office of the Circuit
Court of Fairfax County to examine the title? the transaction
was closed in the office of the Virginia attorney in Virginia?
the money which had to be borrowed to finance the transaction

41
was borrowed from the Northern Virginia Savings and Loan
Association, a savings and loan association in Virginia,,
There has —
QUESTIONS

It was mortgage money?

MR, BOOKER:
QUESTION:

Sir?
It was mortgage money?

MR, BOOKERs
QUESTIONs

Yes, Your Honor* it —
Isn't that, by the decision of this

Court, in the Interstate Commerce Commission?

All mortgage

money,
MR, BOOKER:

If Your Honor please, this money did

not move out of Virginia,
QUESTION:

How did it get there?

MR, BOOKER:

The money — it was a savings and loan

association in Arlington, Virginia, Your Honor; the money was
deposited presumably by Virginia residents who desired to
purchase shares or to make investments in a Virginia savings
and loan association»
QUESTION:

And the flow of mortgage money is not

in interstate commerce?
MR, BOOKER:

You say,
Whether the flow of mortgage money is

in interestate
QUESTION:

I’m just using that one

phrase, which

this Court has used,
MR, BOOKER:

We submit that not in this instance,

42
there’s certainly no showing that the money which the GoXdfarhs
borrowed flowed in interstate commerce.
Now, mortgage money may flow in interstate commerce.
But it didn’t here, so far as there’s any proof.
Furthermore, this is not a case involving mortgage
money, this is a case involving title examination? and the title
examination was don© in Virginia and nowhere else.
The only contact the title examination had with any
State was with Virginia.
Let me see whster I can't illustrate that point
more clearly,
Suppose there are two lots in Reston, side by side?
in one of the lots the purchaser has all the money he needs,
he's always lived in Virginia, he never intends to live anywhere else, he works in Virginia.

He has an attorney examine

the title.
His next-door neighbor, on the other hand, lives in
Ohio.

He moves to Virginia, because he's going to work for
i

the government in Washington*
Maryland,,
tion,

He borrows money from a bank in

The loan is guaranteed by the

Veterans Administra­

The price for the property is identical.

The work

required by the title examiner is identical.
What is the title examiner to do when he fixes his
fee?

One transaction has no contact whatever with interstate

commerce, under any stretch of the imagination.

Is the

43
attorney in that case to disregard the Canons of Ethics at
his peril, and charge whatever he thinks is appropriate, or
must he not consider the Canons of Ethics?
QUESTION:

Did you mean to use the phrase ”disobey

the Canons of Ethics"’?
MR. BOOKER:

The Canons of Ethics prescribe what

an attorney must condiser in fixing the schedule, in fixing
the fee, Your Honor? and if he is —
QUESTION:

Could he follow those canons and set it

at less than this fee?
MR. BOOKER:
QUESTION:

Excuse ms, Your Honor?
Could he follow the Canons and set and

fee at less than this?
MR. BOOKER:
QUESTION:
MR. BOOKER:

Absolutely he could hava, Your Honor.
And what would happen to him if he did?
If he consistently did it, for the

purpose of solicitation, he would be disciplined —
QUESTION:
consistently did it.
MR. BOOKER:
Your Honor.
doing it.

All right, let's say if he just
He would be disciplined.
He might or might not be disciplined,

It depends on the purpose for which he was
There was evidence in the record, for example,

that the minimum fee was not followed for a number of title
examinations in Reston, because the attorneys doing those
examinations were doing a number of them and could do them

44
economically at a lesser charge than the suggested fee schedule»
So it would have to depend on the transaction itself»

And the

attorney is told in the introduction to the fee schedule that
it is only one of the elements to be considered, and that it is
not to be controlling, it is purely, as the Canons of Ethics
say, one factor to be considered»
So where the attorney examines a piece of land, where
the title is clearly involved only in Virqinia, he must, at
his peril, disregard, we say, the Canons of Ethics»
And yet the very next lot, which has the kinds of
insubstantial contacts with interstate commerce described in
the record below, must, at his peril, not

consider the minimum

fee schedule, or consider the Canons of Ethics.

For the minute

he begins to consider them, in setting his fee, the petitioners
would contend he has violated the antitrust laws.
We say, just as the Fourth Circuit said, that this is
a test, this is a conflict that no attorney need be put to.
In this instance, there is simply no substantial
effect on interstate commerce.

There is nothing in the record

below to indicate that the choice of a home in Virginia is, in
any way, influenced by the cost of title examination.
The title examination is something which one, after
he decides upon the purchase, then is concerned about.

There

is no evidence of any kind in the record that title examinations
in Virginia asrs more or less expensive than in Maryland or the

45
District of Columbia.

There is a complete absence of any

evidence that there is any effect on interstate commerce,, and
counsel for the petitioners have very fairly conceded in
their brief that clearly this transaction is not in interstate
commerce.
This Court spoke to the question of interstate
commerce just three months ago# in Copp v. Gulf.

In that

case, which was a Clayton Act case and not a Sherman Act case#
this Court nevertheless said.,

what we say is very important

in this case, and I might quote from the Courts
"Even if the Clayton Act were held to extend to
acquisitions and sales having substantial effects on commerce"
—- and that’s a test which must be met here — Ha court cannot
pressure that such effects exist*

The plaintiff must allege

and prove that apparently local acts in fact have adverse
consequences on interstate markets and the interstate flow of
goods in order to invoke federal antitrust provisions” [sic]„
And there simply is no such evidence in this case 0
This is simply not a case involving interstate commerce.
But if —
QUESTION*

How about Judge Bryan’s findings# on

pages 9 and 10 of the Appendix, he found contrary to your
contention# didn’t he?
MR. BOOKER*

Yes, Your Honor# but that is a con­

clusion of law, we submit, and this Court, as the Fourth

46

Circuit, has the right to review that.

And the Fourth Circuit

did review that, and the Fourth Circuit concluded there were no
substantial effects on interstate commerce.
And therefore there was no basis for jurisdiction*
QUESTION: Do you agree with the Solicitor General that
the test is whether the defendants' activities affect interstate
commerce rather than whether the

plaintiffs' activity was in

in be rs bate comme rce? "
MR. BOOKER:

No, sir, we do not.

We say the

question is whether the transaction affects substantially
interstate commerce.

Has this, transaction substantially

affected interstate commerce?
it has,

And there is no evidence that
^

This is a title examination, at a cost of $522 on a
house which was valued at over $50,000.

And we say that does

not show an effect of any substantial nature on interstate
Commerce.
But turning now from that to the question of whether
there is a learned profession exertion or exclusion from the
antitrust law3:

It is incorrect, we submit, to say that we

seek here today an exemption for the practice of law.
To the contrary, the practice of law has never been
considered to be trade or commerce before.
an exemption here.

We are not seeking

We are saying that the coverage of the

antitrust laws, as Congress intended the term "trade and commerce"

47
to mean in 1890, simply does not extend to the learned
profession.
There are Acte where Congress has carved out
legislative immunity from the antitrust laws.

The Capper”

Volstead Act, for example? trade associations? and the
Kern-Ferguson Act? insurance.

Where, absent some congressional

authority, commerce; insurance, clearly commerce; agricultural
organizations, clearly commerce? were said to be exempt
because of congressional declaration from the antitrust laws.
But that is not this case.
There is no case which has said that law is trade
or commerce.

To the contrary, everything the courts have said

and we have called the Court's attention to each one of those
instances in our brief, over the past eighty years and perhaps
even if we wanted to go back to The Schooner NYMPH, to 1833,
has said that there is a distinction between trad© and
commerce, and the professions.
In fact, the phrases of the Sherman Act in 1890
had only the precedent of The Schooner NYMPH before them at that
time, and in that case Mr. Justice Story very clearly said
that trade is one thing and the learned professions and the
arts are another.
So if there was anything which the

Congress had

in its mind at that time, in 1890, it i^ould have been the
decision in The Schooner NYMPII.

48
In that connection it is significant,, we submit, that
the Department of Justice in 1961 and again in 1965, when the
question of advisory fee schedu3.es were put to it by a sister
bar organization of the Fairfax Rar Association, said;

We

gard this as not falling within the Sherman Act,
Why?
practice of law*

Because the Sherman Act does not apply to the
It’s not in commerce, it’s not commerce.

That was the Department of Justice's view ten years ago, fifteen
years ago,

A view which the Department of Justice changed only

last year.
The Solicitor General has not commented upon that
change in the Department of Justice's view; but I submit that
that is persuasive evidence that the Department of Justice,
along with the Congress, along with this Court, along with other
courts which had spoken to the issue, had concluded that the
antitrust laws in fact do not apply to the practice of law,
But if we're wrong as to that, should, in fact, per
se treatment be accorded to the practice of law?
And let me also suggest another analogy, and I think
this takes off on what the Solicitor General said:

Suppose

there is a town in which there are two businesses, a large one
and a small one.

Both of these businesses are in the process

of trying to develop a breakthrough invention, a means of turning
solar energy into nuclear energy.
as hard as they can.

They are both working on it

49

In order to do that, they need a particular kind of
refractor which is available only from one company.

The

large company goes to the manufacturer of the refractor and
says, I want to purchase a refractor from you, but I want you
to agree with ms that you will not sell it to my competitor
who is also working on this process,
I suggest to you that that manufacturer has a serious
antitrust problem on his hands.
But suppose there's only one patent lawyer in the
city?

And the first manufacturer goes to the patent lawyer

and says, I want to apply for a patent, and here is the back­
ground of the patent, and I want you to agree with me that
you will not represent my competitor in a patent action.
Is there any antitrust violation there?
not.

Of course

The attorney there is following the Canons of Ethics,

which forbid any conflict of interest,
Nov;, the Solicitor General would suggest that some
of the Canons of Ethics are good ones and some of them are
bad ones,

I suspect the Solicitor General would say:

I think

Canons of Ethics forbidding conflicts of interest are good,
and that we should have them, and that we should prevent
attorneys from having conflicts of interest.
The Solicitor General seems not quite as certain
as counsel for the Goldfarbs as to whether advertising by
attorneys is good or bad.

Both seem to believe that minimum

50

fee schedules and a recommendation that they b® considered
along with many other factors are bad.
So we see before us three different Canons of Ethics
in the illustrations I’ve suggested.
One involving a minimum fee schediile.
One involving advertising.
And one involving a conflict of interest.
And some of us would say that they are all proper,
that the bar is capable and responsible for self-regulation»
Some would say some are good and some are bad.
But is that any way for laws to be enforced?

Is

that any way for an attorney to know how to determine how he
should perform his practice?
We submit not.

That there is no way that can be

selective or choice enforcement of the antitrust laws.
If, indeed, certain aspects of the practice of law
do involve interstate commerce, and we assert they do nets if,
indeed, certain aspects of the practice of law ought to.be
regulated by some other body than by professional responsibility,
then we submit that regulation should be made by the Congress
and not by the Courts.

By the Congress which has the opportunity

to examine the entire background of the matter, to determine
what is appropriate under all tie circumstances.
QUESTION:

Do you have any doubt that the Virginia

Legislature could provide by law that the minimum fee schedules

51
were against the law in Virginia?
MR, BOOKER:

Virginia has an antitrust law.

Wo

actions have been brought under that antitrust law against
advisory fee schedules* Your Honor.
QUESTIONt

Well* what if the Virginia Legislature*

at its next session* were to say:

We don’t care whether the

federal antitrust laws apply or not* we don't want minimum
fee schedules for lawyers here in Virginia? is there any
reason why they couldn't pass a law to that effect?
MR* BOOKERs

Certainly the problem of interstate

commerce is solved by that.

The State can certainly regulate

in that area,
I would believe that Virginia Legislature could* if
it saw fit to, enact such a law* Your Honor? yes* sir.
In fact* the State of Virginia has enacted certain
laws relating to the practice of law.
Virginia, for example* to solicit,

It’s a misdemeanor in

7\nd if that's the case*

then certainly the State* if it saw fit* after consideration*
were to make such a rule* .it obviously would be subject to the
same type of constitutional review as any other State statute*
but certainly it's within their power to do so„
QUESTION:

Does it still have the running and

capping statute?
MR. BOOKER:
vary much with us

Yes* it does* Your Honor,

That's still

52
QUESTIONs

[Laughing]

I'm still trying to find out

what it meant.
I*ra still open to be told what it meant.
MR. DOOKERs

([Laughing!.

Well, that's sort of like

champerty and maintenance, Your Honor, I’ve never quite understood
the distinction, either,
QUESTIONS

Yes,

MR. BOOKER:

Turning to the question as to which the

Attorney feneral of Virginia will spend more time than I today,
oh the question of whether the Parker v. Brown doctrine insulates
the advisory fee schedules of the Virginia State Bar, or of
local bar associations, from the antitrust laws, I pause only
to point out, in that context, that counsel for the Goldfarbs,
in his opening argument, has generally agreed with our position;
and that is that when the State promulgated minimum fee
schedules in 1962 and 1969, under the imprimatur of the Virginia
State Bar, which

is

an administrative agency of the Virginia

Supreme Court, and then issued the opinions which it did, it
thereby did indeed sanction and direct State action.
And as I understand the argument for petitioners here
today, that State action was bad as to the Virginia State Bar,
and so it's bad as to local bar associations.
But if this Court concludes, as the court below did,
that the action is proper as to the Virginia State Bar, then we
say it must follow that that action was proper as to the Fairfax

53
Bar Association»
And in addition to the promulgation of the two
collections of the minimum fee schedules# the Virginia Stats
Bar has indeed issued various ethical opinions considering
minimum fee schedules,.
Let me simply call to the Court's attention Opinion

98, which is reproduced in the Joint Appendix at page A*46»
I simply wish to read one sentence from that?

HTo ignore

3uch schedules under these circumstances has no ethical
justification and deserves censure»"
These opinions are available to and are furnished
to every member of the Virginia State Bar,
when he reads that?

What is he to do

Is he not to consider that?

Of course it’s not binding»

Of course it's not the

only thing he will consider.
There were six considerations under the Canons of
Ethics»

There are eight considerations under the Code of

Professional Responsibility*

But it’s one of the things he

must consider.
I would be surprised if there is a lawyer within the
sound of my voice today who has not, at one time or another,
considered the propriety or the ability of a client to pay a
fee in establishing the proper fee to charge that cliante
If a businessman were to pick and choose among his
customers as to what he would charge them, he would pretty

54

clearly be in violation of the antitrust laws»
Would anyone suggest that an attorney, who follows
the Canons of Ethics, which say that he should consider the
ability.of the client to pay — it’s set forth right in this
opinion — x^ould anyone suggest that he has thereby violated
the antitrust laxvs?
Of course not.
It's a service»

That's the nature of the profession»

It*s a service to society, and not a mere

money-making occupation.

As the Canons of Ethics has so

frequently pointed out.
Even if none of the protections x-hich I suggest exist,
that is, feat there is no substantial effect on interstate
commerce, that the practice of law is not included within the
ambit of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, that the Parker v.
Brown doctrine does indeed insulate the Fairfax Association
schedule from the antitrust laws.
Even if we and the court below were wrong on all of
those, we submit this is nto a per se case.

It is not a case

in which this Court, or any court, without consideration of
all of the factors, without consideration of all the professional
responsibilities, can act.
But even if we're wrong about all of that, we
suggest that this fee, this decision should not be applied
retroactively.

That attorneys who, as the court below said,

have in oood faith followed the Canons of Ethics, should be

55
punished in a punitive way? for that’s what treble-damage
recovery is, it’s punitive in nature*
dozens of times, and indeed it is.

This Court has said it
Why they should be

punished in a financial way because of their adherence to the
minimum fee schedule, because of their consideration of these
advisory schedules, along with all the other tests, this
Court in the Chevron decision set forth the circumstances
under which it would excuse retroactive application of the law*
Without going into that case in detail, we suggest
that if this Court gets to that point, and we say there’s no
reason for it to get to this point, it shoud® apply the
Chevron test and decide that any decision shou

be applied

in the future only.
But we get back to the same thing*, as we began.
There is no substantial effect on interstate commerce
here.

There i3 no basis for this Court to say some Canons of

Ethics are good and some Canons of Ethics are bad, and we’ll
award the attorney who follows the good ones and we’ll punish
the attorney who follows the bad ones.
as to which this Court should speak.

Those are not matters
Those are matters as to

which'Congress,if speaking must be done, should speak.
So we say, in conclusion, that the professional
system of self-regulhtion of the practice of law, the discipline
and ethics of the attorney, which we suggest have furnished this
country exceptionally good legal services over the years,

56
services which are often provided free, or at minimal cost,
to those who are unable to pay for them*
If this system is to be changed upon a plea of
consumer interest, and the distinctions between trades and
professions obliterated, we suggest that that obliteration
should not be dene by the courts but by the Congress.
And if it must be done, it may be the consumers
who suffer the most.
There is no evidence to the contrary.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Booker, this doesn't bear on this

case, but I'm looking at the next

case down the road.

You have spoken of the ’'learned professions", and
v/ould you define that for me?

Would it include engineers?

Would it include registered nurses, who these days are
unionised?

And Chiropractors, Osteopaths, and Natureopaths,

and all the others?
MR. BOOKER:
association.

Your Honor, I speak only for a bar

I speak in the context of what I understand the

traditional professions to have been at the time Mr. Justice
Story spoke in 1832.

The professions are:

medicine, lax*,

and the divinity.
I do not speak for other organizations which call
themselves professions, whether they are or not, I do not
know.

I do suggest that traditionally England and in the

United States, and certainly at the time Mr. Justice Story

57
spoke, those were the professions.
QUESTION:

Your retroactivity points goes only to the

damages ?
MR. BOOKER;
QUESTION:
MR. BOOKER;
QUESTION:
MR. BOOKER:

That's correct, Your Honor.
Was there a prayer for injunction here?
There was.
Is that moot or not?

I just don't —

It is moot because the Fairfax

Bar Association has rescinded its schedule.
QUESTION:

Well, that's -- you think that moots it

in an antitrust case, just the cession of an elleqed illegal
activity?
MR. BOOKER;

In this case if there is to be

prospective application only, thatrs correct, Your Honor.
But in fact, there was no suspension of the injunction below.
When the injunction below was entered on February 2, 1973, the
Bar Association immediately sent notice to everyone not to
consider the advisory fee schedule any longer.
QUESTION; Well, suppose we agreed with you on the
damages, it shouldn't be prospective — or retroactive, would
— should the case be dismissed as moot or would — what would ~
but assume we disagreed with you on all your antitrust points,
what would —
MR. BOOKER:

We would suggest at?that point, the

case is moot, Your Honor, because the fee schedule has been

58

rescinded, and because there is no question —
QUESTIONS

Well, isn't there an antitrust

principle that this continuance of an antitrust violation
doesn't guarantee that you’re not to get an injunction?
MR. BOOKER:

Yes, I hesitate to reach that point

because we say there's no antitrust violation, •—
QUESTION:

Yes, I know you do,

MR. BOOKER:

—- but assuming we’re wrong on that,

assuming we’re wrong on that, we say that the fact that a
practice which everyone regarded as a proper practice until
suit was brought in this case, but which has now been dis~
continued, was discontinued long before there had been any
definitive statement by this Court, is moot»
If this were something which were continuing in the
future, that might be different if this Court had spoken.
But this Court had not spoken and has not spoken.
QUESTION: But you're not — you're

just speaking

for Fairfax County Bar?
MR. BOOKER:

I am, Your Honor.

That's my client

here today*
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

Exactly.

And we haven't —

So it may or may not be moot, even if

you’re right about the mootness as to your client, it may
or may not be moot as to the Virginia State Bar?
MR. BOOKER:

It may not be, and I speak not to the

59
mootness question as to the Virginia State Bar.
QUESTION:
QUESTION:
to

Right.
Mr. Booker, would you give your answer

the question I asked of Mr. Morrison?
MR. BOOKER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
As to what is the Fairfax Bar’s stated

justification for the recision of its schedule?
MR. BOOKER:

If Your Honor please,the Fairfax Bar

Association has long since exhausted all of its resources and
ability and means to defend this litigation.

When the Fairfax

Bar Association was successful in the Fourth Circuit, it sought
to avoid further expense, further threats, further uncertainty
as to its members.
Without in any way conceding that the adoption and
the promulgation of the advisory fee schedule was illegal or
wrong, and the resolution reprinted so reflects.

The

Association concluded that in order to remove this uncertainty,
end in order, it hoped, to avoid the expense and necessity of
further litigation, it would rescind its advisory fee schedule.
QUESTION:

So you’re not charging minimum fee

schedules now?
MR, BOOKER:

We are not, Your Honor.

MR,. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
any.
Mr, Attorney General.

Perhaps there won’t be

60

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW P„ MILLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT VIRGINIA STATE BAR
MR. MILLERs

Mr. Chief Justice, *an(3* :may it please

the Court:
My name is Andrew Miller.

I am Attorney General of

Virginia, and counsel for the Virginia State Bar.
% portion of the argument will be devoted to a
discussion of the nature of the organisation known as the
State Bar, its role in the activities which form the basis
for this proceeding, and the reasons why this role constitutes
a Stata action.
Now, the State Bar is an administrative agency of
the Supreme Court of Virginia, created by that Court pursuant
to the laws of the Commonwealth in 1938.
The Virginia Supreme Court has promulgated rules
governing the conduct of attorneys and the operation of the
State Bar, which are found in Part 6 of the Court's Rules.
The powers of the State Bar were assigned by the
Supreme Court to its counsel, to which, in addition to certain
elected members, six persons are appointed by the Court itself.
Now, there are a number of voluntary bar associations
in the Commonwealth, both at the local and at the State level.
At the State level there’s .the Virginia Bar Association, the
Old Dominion Bar Association, the Virginia Trial Lawyers’
Association, et cetera.

61

But each attorney practicing law in Virginia is
required by statute and by rule to be a member of the State Bar,
The State Bar is mandated, both by the General Assembly and the
Supreme Court of Virginia to investigate alleged violations of
prescribed standards of conduct, and to report its findings to
a court of appropriate jurisdiction for any disciplinary
procedures,
These investigations are carried out by district
committees of the State Bar, organized in each of the ten
congressional districts in the Commonwealth.
Pursuant to the Code, the funds for the operation of
the State Bar are appropriated from a special fund in the State
Treasury by Act of the General Assembly of Virginia,

This

special fund in the State Treasury consists of fees paid by
rcsibers of the State Bar, the amounts of which are set pursuant
fi

to statute by the Supreme Court.

And the General Assembly has

established a ceiling on the setting of such fees.
The State Bar has given, been given authority by the
Supreme Court of Virginia to issue advisory opinions on matters
involving questions of ethics.

Analyses of existing fee

schedules of local bar associations by th,s State Bar involve
questions of ethics, in that they may provide some guidance
on the subject of fairness of fees.
It has been stipulated that the State Bar has been
tthorized, Mr. Justice White, by the Supreme Court to issue

62

opinions, such as legal ethics opinions 98 and 170, which
relate to the significance of minimum fee schedules adopted
by local bar associations, and to disseminate studies on
such schedules.
I refer you to Stipulation 19,
lR Parker v. Brown, this Court stated that the
Sherman Act was not intended by Congress to restrain actions
by the State, its officers or agents.

Now, while the fact

that there is State action does not automatically confer
antitrust immunity upon a person or corporation, I submit
tliat the Sherman Act sanctions are inapplicable to a State
agency involved in such activity.

And this is true, I submit,

whether the State action is mandated by a command of the
Legislature, as in. Parker, or by the Judiciary — and, Mr,
Justice Brennan, you raised the question of inherent power
earlier in this argument — or by both, as in this case,
- Now, the conduct of the State Bar alleged to have
contributed to a restraint of trade relates to its role in
enforcement of the Code of Professional Responsibility
promulgated by the Supreme Court of Virginia in 1970,
Now, pursuant
very clear

and the Supreme Court made this

— both to the statute and its inherent authority,

the Supreme Court of Virginia organised the State Bar to act
as its administrative agency for the purpose of investigating
and reporting violations of such ethical standards as the Court

63
has promulgated.
Further, pursuant to both statute and inherent
authority, the Court has implemented specific disciplinary
procedures, should violations be deemed to have occurred.
In 1970 the Supreme Court amended its rules by
substituting a new Coda of Professional Responsibility for the
Canons of Professional Bthics, which had been promulgated in
1938 at the time that the State Bar was created.
Nowt pursuant to this Code, an attorney is prohibited
from charging an esicessive fee.

In. .determining his fee', it is

provided that an attorney should consider, among seven other
factors, the fee customarily charged in the locality for
similar legal services.
It is further

stated that suggested fee schedules

provide guidance as to what might be considered reasonable fees.
Now, clearly, the State Bar has the duty to provide
attorneys and local bar associations with sub-guidelines by
whicK the reasonableness of fees can be judged.

And the

minimum fee schedule reports circulated in 1962 and 1969 serve
this purpose,
I want to emphasise to the Court, in response to some
previous questions from the bench, however, that the State Bar
did not undertake to establish a minimum fee schedule for the
State as a whole.

All that these reports of 1962 and 1969

address themselves to were an..analysis of the fee schedules

64

which had in fact been adopted by local bar associations»
QUESTION:

Was there a good deal of variation among

various localities of the State?
MR. MILLER:

That is exactly correct, sir.

a consequence the reports showed that there

And as

a variation,

that this was an analysis, and the results of the analysis
were submitted to the local bar associations for their
consideration.
But in this particular case, I would like to point
out, Your Honor, that, as shown on page 11 of our brief, that
•?die minimum fee schedule which was adopted by the defendant
Fairfax County Bar Association, contrary to assertions which
appear in the brief of petitioners, did in fact contain
significant variations from the minimum fee report which the
Virginia State Bar sent out in 1969.

That is footnote 4 on

that page, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Mr» Attorney General, what has the state

Bar done since the injunction.was issued?
MR. MILLER:
QUESTION:
MR. MILLER:

As far as issuing advisory opinions?
As far as this case is concerned.
Well, sir, of course, as far as the

State Ear is concerned, the State Bar was not found to have
been in violation of the Sherman Act, and, as a consequence,
the State Bar has proceeded to continue with respect to its
operations as mandated by the Rules of Court adopted by the

65

Supreme Court of Virginia*
QUESTION:

In regard to minimum fees?

MR* MILLER:

I know of no instance in which an

advisory opinion has been requested, Your Honor, of the State
Bar since this case started with respect to minimum fees0

As

counsel for petitioners indicated this morning, there has never
been a complaint to the Virginia State Bar that in fact an
ethical violation has occurred,
NOW

QUESTION:

Well, is there any more suggested fees

that's going to be sent out?
MR. MILLER:

I know of no plans of the Virginia

State Bar to send out another report, such as was sent out in
1962 and 1969, Your* Honor,
QUESTION:

Bo you

the supreme Court has not

required any local bar to make up a . minimum fee schedule or
hasn't required lawyers to follow it?
MR. MILLER:

I -think that the record reflects, Your

Honor, that in 1962 there was some 21 minimum fee schedules in
effect, our local bar association —
-p

QUESTION:

Yes, but the Supreme Court hasn’t required

local bars to propound them, has it?
MR. MILLER: Well, that was ray point, of course,
because there are many more local bar associations, and 21 —
QUESTION:

Yes.

And I suppose if it did require it,

66

Fairfax would not have discontinued its fee schedule®
And certainly the State Bar has neither required nor suggested
that local bars have minimum fee schedules, X take it?
MR. MILLER:

As far as the State Bar is concerned,

it has not required the local bar associations
minimum fee schedule.
QUESTION:

adopt a

That is correct, no.
But if some — now, and you're still

suggesting, however, that there's enough official action
behind fee schedules to satisfy Parker?
MR. MILLER:

As far as the State Bar is concerned,

I don't think there's any question about it, sir.
QUESTION:

What you mean there isn't any -— you mean

that it does or it doesn't?
[Laughter.3
MR. MILLER:

Well, I mean that in fact the Parker

doctrine applies to the State Bar.
QUESTION:

Well, it hasn't required anything of

local bar associations.
MR. MILLER:

Well, as representing the State Bar,

it’s the ~ the suit is against the State Bar, as well as
against the local bar association,

MR,MILLER:

Yes, it is.
Now, whether or not a local bar associa­

MR„MILLER:

It hasn’t

MR. MILLER:

As far as what the State Bar has done

in this instance, which is to issue advisory opinions, there
are two of them, that is clearly required under the Rules of the
Supreme Court, Rule 10*
QUESTION:
MR. MILLER:

Yes, but that’s —
As far as circulating the minimum fee

schedules, Your Honor, I think clearly the State Bar had a
duty in light of the reference not only in ethical considera»
tion 2«IS, but disciplinary rule 2-106, where references are
made to customary fees and suggested fee schedules, to provide
some guidance under the mandate from the Supreme Court,
QUESTION:

Well, would you suppose that

Parker v.

Brown is satisfied, or the exemption is ~ comes into being
if the State simply passes a law and says, The sellers of
tobacco in this State may now agree, if they want to, on
prices.
MR. MILLER:

I think, Your Honor, that this case is

68

completely different from the Asheville Board of Trade# which
I assume you may be referring to, because there was a local
association of warehousemen# who set about to restrict prices
and restrict selling space on the floors of the warehouse*
This is not that case at all»

Here you have —

QUESTION: Well# how about my question# though, Mr*
Attorney General?

A State simply authorizes a group of

businessmen# if they want to# to fix prices*

Now# does that

bring into being Parker v. Brown# do you think?
MR* MILLER:

No# sir, it does not»

QUESTION* And so if the Supreme Court simply
authorised the State Bars to propound, but didn't require it#
if you want to propound fees# go ahead* if you —
MR* MILLER:

I thought I alluded to that point

earlier# in saying that the State Bar has not promulgated a
fee schedule here which is applicable to all attorneys in the
State.

All that the State Bar has done in this particular

instance is to provide analyses of existing local minimum
fee schedules.
As far as issuing the advisory opinions are concerned#
there again that was part of the role of the state Bar# as
the administrative agency of the Supreme Court.

This is

entirely different from simply allowing individuals# the
businessmen whom you allude to# to go out and decide what
they're going to do on their own. Because I think you have to

69

take a look at the minimum fee schedule in the context of the
Code of Professional Responsibility.

And the minimum fee

simply relates to one of the criteria set forth in

disciplinary rules *“~
QUESTIONS

Do you think the State Bar would be within

its authority, if it put out an order to —- as an adminsitrative
agency of the State, which you suggest that it is, if it put
«

out an ord^r to all local bar associations to propound a fee
schedule,
MR. MILLER?
QUESTIONs

Well, sir, —
-- and then said all lawyers must obey it.

Is that within its authority?
MR, MILLER:

It is not, because that has not been

authorised by the Legislature or the Supreme Court of Virginia.
However, if in fact it were authorised by the Legis~
lature and the Supreme Court of rirginia, I think it could,
yes, sir.

Court regulations specifically and explicitly regulating fees

In many States,

I think there are statutes or Court rules, which explicitly
provide what the fees shall be to counsel for the executor

Does Virginia have

anything such as that?
MR.MILLER:

No, sir.

We do not.

Yes, but they are covered in there?
That is correct, sir.
This was simply by way of a service of

the State Bar Association to its local components, is that
what you suggest about that analysis?
MR, MILLER:

Well, I think, may it please the Chief

Justice, you have, as far as the Code of Professional
Responsibility, two concerns:

one, that there not be an

excessive fee charged, nor that solicitations be permitted
to occur.
And I think when you have one factor which may be

71

considered in determining the reasonableness of the fee,
obviously any information which impinges on that determination
should be made available, and that’s precisely what the State Bar
was attempting to do in this instance.

But it was not requiring

that such fee schedules be adopted locally, and in fact the
majority of local bar associations, no such fee schedules were
adopted,

You say that they also aimed at excessive

Do you have any opinions on that?
MR. MILLERS

Well, I think the DR-2-106 clearly

states tliat a lawyer shall not enter into an agreement for a
charge or collect an illegal or clearly excessive fee.

Well, I can’t hold you responsible for that.

All I'm trying to suggest to the Court

is that the Code of Professional Responsibility deals with
both aspects, excessive fees on the other hand, and solicitation
on the other.

MR. MILLER:

All right.

Thank you, sir.

What the --in the Appendix at pages 47 and 48,
Opinion No. 170 of the Virginia State Bar —
QUESTION: Right.
MR'» MILLER:

What that does is simply to require

a lawyer to produce evidence that such charges are not made
for the purposes of soliciting business.

And if in fact he

shows that he's not using this as an advertising device,
then there is no ethical violation.
QUESTION:

But there seems to be a presumption,

doesn’t there?
MR. MILLER:

No, sir, I would not regard it as a

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN B. MORRISON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MORRISON:

Thank you, Mr, Chief Justice,

I'd like to respond to the question that Justice
Rehnquist asked about the commerce matter.
We believe that the Solicitor General is entireXy
correct in his position that the focus should be on the activity
of the defendants, whereas we have here a broad-base conspiracy
involving all of the attorneys in Northern Virginia who have
agreed to a per se violation constituting price-fixing, and
we look to the decision of this Court in Burke v, Ford for that
kind of analysis, where we plainly have a restraint against
title examinations which ara not only an integral part of homo

74
financing in Northern Virginia* hut an absolute necessity
because under the opinions of the Virginia Bar only the
lawyers can* give opinions on title examinations „
QUESTION;

You're not however attacking this minimum

fee schedule only in so far as it involves a title examination*
are you?
MR. MORRISON:

The complaint is directed in that*

solely toward title examinations*
with respect to title examinations.

The only evidence came in
We believe* however* that

once fee schedule is declared unlawful with respect to that,
we’ve mat our jurisdictional requirement as to that, then the
remainder of the fee schedule also must b© declared —
QUESTION: Even though they would clearly not defect
to interstate commerce at all?
MR.MORRISON:
QUESTION:

I think that’s right.
Providing local little-old-ladies will,

in a small town, and right in the middle of a State.
MR. MORRISON:

That’s right, Your Honor.

[Laughter. ]
MR. MORRISON:

On the assumption that you didn’t

have any relatives in another State or —
QUESTION:

You didn't have any out-of-State

property —
MR. MORRISON:
[Laughter.)

That's right.

That’s right*

75
MR* MORRISON3
Honor*

That, then, is our position, Your

That is our position, Your Honor.
That where we have a massive involvement, as we have

here, with interstate commerce, that once we’ve established
the jurisdictional nexus and shown that the transaction, the
restraint here operates on an integral part of what, is a larger
interstate transaction, and we have a per ss violation that
under Burke we need not inquire further.
As the Court said there, such per se restraints
inevitably affect interstate commerce.

And that the kind of

proof which Mr. Booker suggests is required, certainly .is
impossible to do with lots of little small transactions.
So we look at the entire context, and in that x-ray we believe
that we satisfy the commerce requirements.
fly time has been limited here, so I would refer the
Court only to my brief with the issues — with regard to the
issue of prospectivity, and as far as the question of mootness
is concerned, the case is certainly not moot as to the Virginia
State Bar, which has, to this date, insisted upon its right
to issue the Ethical Opinions, to continue them in force, it
has not withdrawn them.

It may, tomorrow, issue another

updated fee report, with recommendations to the local bars,
or indeed promulgate its own fee report as to which this Court
should and ought, in this posture, to adjudicate the lawfulness
of it

76

And, finally, I would just say that with regard to
the position previously taken by the Justice Department, those
letters appear in the Appendix, at pages 49 to 58, and indicate
in that context that the Justice Department was primarily
concerned about the commerce question, indicating that the
practice of law did not affect commerce.

And for that

reason, minimum fee schedules were not subject to the Sherman
Act,

Not because lawyers were exempt from the antitrust

laws.
Thank you very much,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted,
[Whereupon, at 2*03 o’clock, p,m., the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.J
