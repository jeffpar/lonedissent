MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 31, Original, State of Utah against the United
States.
Mr. Boggs, you may proceed when you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANNY JULIAN BOGGS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT
MR. BOGGS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This original case is here on exceptions to the
report of the Special Master in the reliction phase of the
continuing litigation between Utah and the United States over
the ownership of land in the vicinity of the Great Salt Lake.
This litigation was authorised by the Great Salt
Lake Lands Act of 1965.

Pursuant to that Act, the United

States, in 1967, quitclaimed to Utah all of its interests
other than mineral rights within the surveyed meanderline of
the Great Salt Lake.
That line generally, though not invariably, runs
on. land that has been above the Lake level for fifty years or
more.
Utah was to pay for the land that the United States
stated that it owned, or to litigate the United States title
in an original action in this Court.

Utah chose to litigate.

In the first stage of this litigation, this Court

held that the Great Salt Lake was navigable and that Utah
thus acquired title to its bed at Statehood in 1896.
This settled the question of ownership of the land
that was still under water at the time of the deed in 1967.
That area is the inner, lighter-shaded, area on Defendants
Exhibit 2, the map shown in the back of the Special Master's
report.
We are today concerned essentially with the area
between the level of the Lake at Statehood and the level of
the Lake as of the date of the quitclaim deed.

That land is

the middle darker band shown —QUESTION:

Let us find -that map,- you've got several

exhibits here.
MR. BOGGS:

Yes, sir.

Defendant's Exhibit 2 is

about the third exhibit from the back of the set of exhibits.
QUESTION:

Is this it?

MR. BOGGS:

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, that is the

map.
We are today discussing essentially the title to
approximately the inner, the middle darker colored band on.
Exhibit 2.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, Mr. Bcgg®, are the parties

now in agreement as to the two errors that were mentioned
in the Special Master's report, the Statehood level —
MR. BOGGS:

The 4200.2 against 4200.8 —

QUESTIONi

Yes .

MR. BOGGS:
QUESTION:

— and the 396,000 against 325,000.
That’s correct.

MR. BOGGS:

Yes, sir, I believe that we both in

our briefs stated that we were in agreement with the facts as
we each stated them.
QUESTION: So that that is out of the case at this
point?
MR. BOGGS:
QUESTION:

Yes, si a:.
Mr. Boggs, you say that we’re discussing

the inner darker band —
MR. BOGGS:
QUESTIONs

The middle.
That's assuming that all of the

circumferences of the Lake were claimed by the United States,
though, isn't it?

Which I would assume —

MR. BOGGS:

Yes, sir, you're right.

Your Honor is

correct that we're discussing specifically those areas in
which the United States is the upland owner, across that
middle band.
The United States contends that by operation of the
doctrine of reliction, as consistently recognized by this
Court, the lake bed which Utah owned receded as the lake
receded, and to the extent that it was the upland owner,
the property interests of the United States extended down to
the new water level at the date of the quitclaim deed.

Utah, on the other hand, contends that the measure
of what it received in 1896 was absolutely fixed as of that
date, and has not altered by any change in the waters of the
lake.
The basic question is thus whether the boundary
between the lake bed, undisputably owned by Utah, and tine
upland, undisputably owned by the United States, is to have
been measured in 1967 with relation to the actual water
level in 1967, because the boundary is an ambulatory one, or
whether that boundary should have been measured with respect
to where the water stood at Statehood or even earlier in the
Nineteenth Century.
I would note that once it is decided as which date

is the date on which the line is to be fixed, an exact line
must be determined which may or may not require further
litigation.
Thus the outer lighter colored band on the map
would be the land between the lake at Statehood and the
surveyed meanderline.

Whereas Utah contends that at State­

hood it gained everything out to the meanderline, the United
States would contend that even if the date was fixed at
Statehood, that was fixed at about the lake level at that
date, that outer band is not in consideration in the litiga­
tion today.
Today, as I said, we are concerned with the applica-

7
tion of the doctrine of reliction to the circumstances of the
movements of the water of the Great Salt Lake.
To first state that doctrine , 1 would give you the
— what this Court said in BoneHi last term, and which the
Special Master quoted, that the general law of.reliction is
that -Idle grantee of land bounded by a body of navigable 'water
acquires a right to any gradual accretion formed along that
shore.
And in light of that I would look at the physical
facts of the movement along the lake, which are undisputed.
The exhibits and the report of the Special Master demonstrate
that the waters of the Great Salt Lake do rise and fall, and,
as they do, considerable areas of shore are exposed or
covered.
Now, one major component of this movement is the
change caused by tine passing of the seasons, which can be seen
on any of the exhibits that the Master has inserted, showing
the levels of the lake.

Every winter and spring there is a

rise, as precipitation and snow-melt increase, and every summer
and fall there is a decline because of less moisture and more
evaporation.
This seasonal change, of course, the parties all
agree, does not change the boundary; not because it may be so
rapid or large as to be visible or perceptible, but simply
because it is a seasonal change, as sho\v*n by cases we’ve cited

at pages 15 and 16 of our brief, and Utah at pages 67 and 68
of -their brief.
In just this same way, an observer or a gauge on
a river would note the rise of floodwaters seasonally, or on
an ocean would note extraordinary tides at certain
astronomical seasons.

These, too, would not cause a change

in the legal boundary.
Another component of the change is caused by the
temporary factors that may come and go in the course of a
day 03: a few days.

These are shown on Exhibit P-15, which is

not reproduced in the Master's report, but is simply a gauge,
a continuous recording of the movements of the lake over the
period of a month.
And -that exhibit and the testimony show that these
changes are almost exclusively caused by a wind or
atmospheric disturbance, which pushes down or pushes up the
■?

lake in one end and then, by a so-called sach

effect the

lake oscillates back and forth, just as if you slosh a
bathtub, it will slosh back and forth with diminishing
vigor, rising and falling at the ends until it begins to
stabilise.
But this, too, is a temporary occurrence.
But finally and most, profoundly, the water level is
changed by the effects of climate over many years.
is exposed or covered may stay that way for decades.

Land that

9
For example, -when the Lake recently rose above
4201 feet above sea level,- it covered land that had been
dry since before 1930=

And when the Lake went down in the

early 1960's, land was exposed which had never been uncovered
in historical time»
We submit that it is these long-term effects only
which vary the legal boundary»

These changes are exactly

analogous to the changes on wandering rivers, such as the
Missouri or Mississippi, with- which this Court has many times
dealt.
There a river max move gradually in one direction
for some years, and then reverse itself and return to its
previous location or even beyond.

But, of course, all during

that movement, the river itself may be rising and falling,
covering and uncovering land due to floods and droughts and
temporary phenomena.
And yet in each of these cases the doctrine of
reliction has always been applied.
I would note that a similar contention to Utah's
here was made in the case of the Missouri River, and the
Court's reply we cite on page 17 of our brief, stating that
"It is contended, however, that the doctrine of accretion has
no application to the Missouri River, on account of the rapid
and great changes constantly going on."
But "our conclusions are that, notwithstanding the

10

rapidity of the changes ... the law of accretion controls.
QUESTIONx Well, wasn’t what the Court was addressing
itself to the contention of the parties that along the
Missouri River great big pieces of the bank would slough off,
and, you know, you could physically see them go?
MR. BOGGS: Well, Your Honor, I think that that was
-- that was certainly the aspect that was before them, and
the Court, in dealing with that, said that you have to —
if the falling off of the bank in -that instance is a result
of essentially a seasonal flood, that that itself does not
change the ordinary rule, that despite the fact that the
river may move rapidly, if taking the situation as a whole
you can say that there's been a gradual or imperceptible
movement, when you say here it is, and, so many years later,
here it is, that reliction will still apply.
I would turn now to the specific —
QUESTION: Before you do, Mr. Boggs, and maybe
you've answered this —
MR. BOGGS:
QUESTION;

Yes, sir?
These concepts of accretion and

reliction and, on the other hand, of evulsion are well known,
of course, to the law of rivers, where the river is a
boundary, either a State boundary or a boundary of somebody's
property, in private property disputes.
cases until this one involving lakes?

Are there any

II
MR. BOGGS :
that this may be

1 believe of the Supreme Court cases

this may bs the only one.

There are

certainly numerous State court cases, which refer to lakes;
and of course the same rules have been applied on an ocean,
which is yet a. third situation, such as Hughes vs. Washington,
which this Court decided some six or seven years ago.
The statement has been continually made through all
of these cases that the law as to accretion and as to
reliction is essentially the same.
QUESTION;
MR. BOGGS:

Yes, but hasn't it always been
Well, reliction is normally what's

being talked of with regard to a lake, but as the water rises
and falls, accretion generally relates to new land actually
being deposited by the movement of a river or an ocean or,
conceivably, even a lake if you had a heavily silted lake,
for instance.

QUESTION;

That's my impression, too.

I remember

Hughes v. Washington, involving the Pacific Ocean.
MR. BOGGS:

I can't call a specific case to your

attention at the moment.
QUESTION: Really, your typical regimen in an
accretion case in a river is quite different from what the
evidence shows here about Great Salt Lake, isn't it?
Where you have erosion on one side of a bank and deposit on
the opposite side, until finally the thing becomes more and
more noticeable, and then you ultimately get a cutoff of an
oxbow bend.
MR. BOGGS:
cutoff.

Well, you may or may not get that

There are many cases which we cite in our brief

where the river moves one way, and then it simply moves back
•the other way.

So that you get ‘that kind of a movement,

which we feel is quite analogous to what has happened here.
QUESTION;

Well, one case that has applied the

doctrine of reliction to a lake, I guess, is the decision
of the Supreme Court of Utah in the Hardy case, applying it
to Great Salt Lake.
Or said it wasn’t applicable,
MR, BOGGS; Right,

They stated that.

If we look at

Utah cases, this was briefed fairly thoroughly before the
Special Master, and then because of this Court's decision in

13
Bone11if the federal common law controlled; we have really
not considered it extensively since then*
But my recollection of the Utah cases before Hardy,
which include cases on lakes,- such as Utah Lake, which is
also a very flat lake, indicate that they seem to — that on
Utah Lake .it may have some application.
And the earlier Utah cases would indicate that there
may have been application even on the Great Salt Lake.
QUESTION: Well, you say that because of Bonslliy
you haven’t looked further into this Hardy case.

But I would

have thought the source of federal common law, if that be what
governs here, is presumably -the decisions of other courts that
may have addressed the same problem.
Here you have a finding by the Special Master that
the Great Salt Lake is unique, and a conclusion by the State
court having jurisdiction over that lake, that because of that
fact reliction doesn't apply.
I would think in formulation of federal common law,
we would pay a great deal of attention to that Hardy case.
MR. BOGGS: Well, Your Honor, we would submit, and I
believe we, in our brief before the Special Master, argued
that even, that time, we said, If you want to consider Hardy,
that the quote uniqueness, which is really the underlying
supposition of the Utah argument, is based upon these temporary
and seasonal fluctuations; that this is where we get into the

14
whole mathematical controversy over how gradual or perceptible
it has been, but that simply because, during the course of a
seasonal rise and fall, or during the course of a storm, the
lake moves rapidly in one direction or another, that this is
not a unique factor, this is not something that is not seen
on rivers — and Mr- Justice Stewart mentioned the Great
Lakes; certaincf the Great Lakes even have the same kind of
•■v

sach

effect, where the wind piles up the water at one end

and then it oscillates back and forth.
So, while we recognise that that case exists, we
believe that it suffers from the same flaws as the doctrine
as a whole.
QUESTION:

Do you think reliction

would you

call it reliction if suddenly all the waters that run into,
all the streams that run into the Great Salt Lake were
diverted, —
MR. BOGGS: Well, Your Honor, tit at would ~
QUESTION:

— and then the lake just hasn’t any

more water running into it, and it just dries up.
MR. BOGGS:
QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor, that would —
Is that reliction?

MR. BOGGS:
that would apply there:

That would either be — several things
one is that in certain of the cases

the question of whether a change has been natural or not,
has been held to be significant.

1‘n Bonelli, the Court held

15
that it was not»
But certainly if the — particularly, as I think
there!s a line or two in Bone111 that mentions that if the
drying up of the lake by diverting the tributaries was caused
by one of the parties with that specific intention, that that
would certainly be a factor as to whether or not it should
apply.
QUESTION;

Well, I just — how about it now, would

it be reliction or not?
MR,, BOGGS;

Well, you know, we would have to look at

exactly what the circumstances are. Certainly there are various
cases that hold when you simply drain a lake for the purpose of
doing something else with it, and perhaps are going to turn it
back, that that is not a reliction, that’s long-year mining.
And certainly, as I said, if the United States were to turn it
off for the purpose of gaining that v/ater, it would not be a
reliction.
But if, as perhaps people thought in 1963, the lake
simply dried up completely, I think we would have to stale that
that was a reliction.
Certainly the Great Salt Lake has been drying up for,
let us say, some ten thousand years, and if we were not to say
that reliction applied, I don't know why Utah should not claim
it all the way back to ancient Lake Bonneville.

If the

boundary is not an ambulatory one but a fixed one, —

IS
QUESTIONS

But Utah hasn't bean in existence that

long, that’s the best reason,
MR. BOGGS:

Well/ as Utah notes, however, -they

claim the water back to before where it was in 1896, back to
the meanderline, which is the first time men strated drawing
those lines.
I would turn now to the specific components
reqtiired for -the operation of the doctrine of reliction, and
to examine how they apply to the facts of the Great Salt
Lake.
The key element in the past, perhaps before
Bonelli, has certainly been that the movement in the water’s
edge is not sudden or violent, but gradual.

This is stated

in various holdings of this Court, such as Philadelphia
Company vs. Gtimson, stating that the title would be fixed
and would remain the same when there is a change that is
sudaen or violent or visible, in a word an evulsion.
Now, here all parties agree that no evulsion has
taken place.

tod as we have noted in our brief, there are

normally, when you see the water at one place today and
another place twenty years later, there is a presumption that
it has moved by a reliction or an accretion.
QUESTION:

Now, I realise that presumption lies

in the cases of accretion, but do the cases support you in
saying that, there’s the same sort of presumption where you're

17
arguing for reliction?
MR. BOGGS;

The case, in that sense, if there are —

the question is, is there a specific lake case that would
hold that, I don’t believe so.

The doctrines have generally

been spoken of together and have not bean differentiated in
that way.
Now, the briefs discuss at some length the question
of just what movement, should be measured, and whether that
i

movement is imperceptible. And I am prepared to discuss that
further, if you wish.

But we would note that in Bonelli

this Court cast considerable doubt upon the necessity even for
literal imperceptibility.
Tiie Court in Bonelli noted the interests and policies
behind reliction, saying that a riparian owner has an
expectancy and an interest in remaining riparian to his land.
And that, since he might lose the use of his land when the
water rises, so he should gain the land that would be
exposed when the water falls.
And in Bonelli the Court found those policies so
strong that it held that a riparian owner was entitled to
remain riparian, even though the land actually —■ the water
actually moved perceptibly.
Thus, the Master’s statement that he could not find
the movements of the lake to be imperceptible does not
necessarily defeat the application of the doctrine of reliction

18

after BoneIli.
In any event, as we essentially — the same ansxfer
we would give to the Hardy Salt question; the examples given
by the Master at pages 17 to 20 of his report about these
great fluctuations, each example that he speaks of are
essentially the seasonal and daily changes that we spoke of.
Now, we concede that during a seasonal rise or during a
storm you can look at the water’s edge and you may be able
to see it move. But certainly in the course of a Missouri
River flood or a Bay of Fundy spring tide, the effect on the
shore lands would be equally visible and perhaps even more
dramatic than these changes on the Great Salt Lake.
Now, the second factor on which the Master relied
was whether the changes in the lake were reasonably permanent.
A close reading of his conclusions of law, in fact, I think
indicates that this was the bedrock of his decision, because
he first stated that the federal common law or reliction
does generally apply, and then stated that the question of
ownership of the lands in question

and I quote — "depends

on whether the exposure of the land referred to, either by
a perceptible or a gradual and imperceptible process" —
'thus, perhaps, taking account of this change in Bonelli;
continue the quotation — "constituted a reasonably permanent
or stable addition to the riparian land."
And this foundation of the Master’s report, we

19

contend, is sixaply not the law.
Certainly none of this Court’s cases over the past
century and more have indicated that there can be no reliction
or accretion if the body of water under consideration may
reverse its course.
In fact, many of those cases concern bodies of water
that were known for wandering back and forth, such as the
Mississippi and Missouri Rivers.
We cite also a number of State cases concerning these
rivers —
QUESTION: What happens when they — if you are right
on When the bottom of the Salt Lake becomes uncovered, as
reliction, then what happens when it’s covered it for another
twenty years?
MR. BOGGS:

Well, .in just the same way that when the

river moves, when the lake goes back up, as it has at the
present time, Utah, as the owner of the lake bed, just as the
owner of -the river bed, its ownership may then •—

worried about the river, just as Utah was worried about the

the other owner, I contract to pay him for it, and in the
passage of time the river starts moving over there, and,
lo and behold, I've got no -QUESTION:

Well, that's all right, but you had

MR. BOGGS:

That's correct.

of what's happened to the lake since then.
QUESTION:

QUESTION:

And if it had relieted more, you would

MR. BOGGS:

No, Your Hon or, if it had relicted

more, that's exactly the opposite; that7s exactly the point.
If the lake had gone further down, we could not have asked
Utah to pay for that land.
QUESTION:
MR. BOGGS;

Because?
Because they would have already owned

it in 1367, as a result of this Court's decision on 'the
navig abi1ity is s ue,
And that's what it -- the water went up and, you
might say, Utah lost its gamble.

They're being asked to pay

for land that's now under water.
If the water had gone down, -die United States would
have lost the gamble, Utah would --QUESTION:

So Utah made a better bargain than you

did,
MR. BOGGS:

Well, Utah ■— now, another point on

the equity is that Utah has the opportunity, of course, simply
to renounce the Act, not pay for it, and then they'll own it

22
under the doctrine of reliction.
What they have been contending for here is a sort
of a both-ways test, when the water is up we feel that they
want reliction to apply, and when the water is down they
don't.
Because, as another example of this, Your Honor,
they contend throughout that they have great interest in
the land on the edge, marshlands and this sort of thing,
and yet, under their contention, when the water goes up,
whether above Statehood or above the meanderline, we have
this controversy? but when it goes above the 18S6 level,
then Utah does not own those edge lands.

Utah' s boundary,

by their contention, is exactly fixed and there they are
left with an area in the middle of the lake, and the upland
owners, such as the United States and private parties, own
all of those edge lands.
And that's the reason that we believe that here,
just as in all the other cases that have applied reliction,
that that is the basis for having an ambulatory boi.md.ary
rather than a fixed boundary.
We recognize that there are certain problems that
an ambulatory boundary causes here. The Court noted similar
problems in Louisiana vs. Texas, with a three-mile limit.
But we would submit, and I think this is the basis of all of
our arguments, that the fixed boundary causes even more

23

problems, that for periods of decades and even longer, Utah,
who is supposed to control the lake, would find that large
areas of the lake were out of his control, and perhaps for
equal periods the riparian owner, who has an interest in
remaining riparian, would find -the lake to be miles from
him and it would remain there for thirty years.
Tills is really the difference between the problems
that are caused by the seasonal fluctuations and the fact that
the long-run fluctuations of the lake are far greater, that
you do have this seasonal fluctuation, but it will be over
here one year and it will stay there, and then twenty or
thirty years later, before it may ever come back; or it may
never come back.

points that we agree on, and that was the first question
asked, I believe.
This point on the "such as", I believe it’s
possible to work out.
QUESTION: Well then, ~~ all right.
Well, can't you do -that?
HR. BOGGS:

Well, we will certainly try.

I'd reserve the balance of my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Dewsnup.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD L. DEWSNUP, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
MR. DEWSNUP:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Before you proceed,

let me suggest that if you gentlemen find some area of common
ground, literally and figuratively, you'll let us know
promptly, won't you?
MR. DEWSNUP:

We will.

I would like a little

clearer picture as to exactly what we might be expected to do
in that regard, so far as making some interim report back to
•the Court,

I'm not too clear on that.

26

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Well, I'm — at least

speaking for myself, I'm not. too clear, either.

But if you

two gentlemen can't ba clear on it, then no one can.
MR. DEWSNUP:

Well, let me spend just one second

at the beginning with respect to the words "such as”..
We, Utah certainly doesn't want to be technical
with regard to a couple of words.

As we pointed out in our

brief, and, incidentally, the Tenth Circuit case was decided
and this Court denied cert two or three weeks ago in that
case; .but Amoco Oil Company is really ready to drill offshore
drilling in the Great Salt Lake now, and the Army Corps of
Engineers contend, has contended that Amoco cannot go ahead
pursuant to the authority it has from the State of Utah,
because, under the Rivers and Harbors Act, they have
jurisdiction, they have to apply and go through the
environmental study, et cetera.
Well, that hassle never was before the court before,
and the argument made in the Tenth Circuit was this Court's
insertion by its own initiative of the words "such as” was
an adjudication of the regulatory authority the United States
applied to the Great Salt Lake, as a navigable water of the
United States.
Now, that, as our brief points out, and I think the
brief has enough of a background? that is why we did not want
a couple of innocent-looking words to create all kinds of

27
problems with the actual physical administration and
development and management of the lake.
Now, 'this — and so, as far as I'm concerned, on
the words "such as", if the government does not insist on
putting them in, we would like to have them out; and if we
can agree on that now, then we* ve agreed on all three changes
suggested in the latter part of our brief, in the avent the
Court looks upon Special Master Pahy's decree as one that
might be entered here.
This case is rather unusual in that the parties
really do not disagree on the legal principles of reliction,
as -they may be stated and as they developed at common law,
and as they appear to be reflected in the federal cases that
have applied the doctrine.

And we really don't differ with

respect to the facts.
The real difference is which facts are relevant to
this case, and whether or not these facts would seem to
Satisfy the doctrine of reliction.
Now, the idling that seemed to impress -the Special
Master the most, and. I think through his discussion, his
findings, his conclusions, that he mentioned mors than a
dozen times the unique, unusual circumstances of the Great
Salt lake that simply cause the doctrine of reliction not to
fit.
And the reason for that, as the Master points out.

28
is this briny residue of the ancient Lake Bonneville, the
Great Salt Lake is in the bottom of a very flat basin.
The shores are virtually horizontal.

It has no outlet, as

most lakes have some kind of tributaries flowing in and some
kind of outlet, and they serve to be self-regulating.
Well, the Great Salt Lake isn’t.

You put water in

it, it’s like putting water in a glass; the only way it’s
going to leave is by evaporation.
And because of the very flat shorellands, any water
that comes in, until it evaporates out, it causes the water
to move out almost horizontally, and then, as the water
evaporates, it moves back in almost horizontally; rather
than a body of water would if it had reasonably steep
shores.
And so because of those very unusual characteristics,
the Special Master continued to characterize them as unique?
ha just could net find, on the evidence presented, that there
had been any gradual imperceptible or reasonably permanent
process which had created new uplands, as distinguished from
the part of the bed of the lake that was subject to
inundation from time to time.
QUESTION;

Are these inlets, these streams coming

in, all from the mountains?
MR. DEWSNUP;

They are all from the mountains

QUESTION; The mountains of —

29
MR. DEWSNUPs

**- some distance removed? when the

streams get next to the lake for a period of miles or ten,
twenty, thirty or forty miles, they might meander slowly
across relatively flat terrain.

Ever* though the headwaters

would he in the mountainous regions, the Wasatch Range.
QUESTION:

And precipitation has a good deal to do

with it, doesn't it?
MR. DEWSKfUPs

Yes.

As Mr. Arnow, of the United

States Geological Survey, explained at some length, and I
think it’s summarized at some extent in the brief, the winds,
the temperature, the salinity of the waters, the gradient of
the shores, all of these things intermixed to cause the lake
continuously to fluctuate.
It's virtually impossible to have a moment when
the total inflow exactly equals total evaporation.
don't get that moment in time.

You just

And so however gradullv in

volume the lake is either going up or going down, and that
movement is greatly exaggerated by the relatively flat
shorelands, the extremely flat shorelands,
I would like to mention a few of the practical or
analytical errors, we think and the Master thought, the
government had fallen into, in-, the analysis of its case.
When the government says the only practical argument
against it, against the government's case, is that the lands
are water-covered now? that just simply isn't true.

30
For one thing,, the government chooses to ignore the
actual water movements.

This basic hydrograph, which appears

as the first attachment to the Master’s report.. Exhibit P-4,
shows ‘the basic annual movements of the lake from 1850 to
1973, when the hearings were held.
And, incidentally, when the lake was first viewed
in 1850, it was at the same elevation, almost exactly, as it
was in .1873, although the variations through year-to-year and
month-to-month and over the long-term are rather remarkable;
but, in any event, the government ignores the actual water
level, the actual water movement of the rate of water
movement, and computes an average annual stage of the lake
by computing the level or stage of the lake one year as it
would compare with the preceding year.

Which serves to

remove the daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal fluctuation.
Now, the parties agree that daily, weekly, seasonal
fluctuations do not result in a change of boundary by
reliction, but -the government then goes to compute the rate
of movement of idle water by reference to its averages,
which have nothing at all to do with the actual rate of
movement of the water.
And the government calculates that the water moves
at a speed of 1.5 inches per hour on the average all the way
around the lake, and 15 inches per hour in its most rapid
rate of speed.

But that just simply isn't so.

31

And the government would have to acknowledge that
isn't so as well, because they base their calculation not
on the water movement itself but upon assumed levels or stages
of the lake.
A second analytical error is the government’s failure
to consider in computing its average movement, the Special
Master made a special note of -this, and the pictures throughout
the brief, the black-and-white pictures, X think illustrate,
generally the lands are very, very level, but where the
mountains come out into the lake there are variations in the
gradient, which would have a direct impact on the rate of
movement of the water, where -'die land is very flat.

The

lake comes up, the water moves over that much more rapidly
•tlian where a mountain comes down at a 45-degree angle' into
the lake.
Another error in the government’s calculation, it
based its rapid imperceptible criterion argument on a 350-mile
contour line, which is situated within the lands now in
dispute.

But that 350-mile line is the surveyed meanderline

that the parties used as a basis for exchanging a quitclaim
deed.

<■
To illustrate that problem very briefly, we’re

talking about an inland lower elevation line that is substantia]
shorter than the surveyed meanderline that might have a
distance of approximately 350 miles.

32

Now, that mathematical calculation might not he
terribly serious.

The government contends that even if it

is off fifty miles in the estimate, that the rate of movement
of the water is still gradual and imperceptible .if it can
use its averaging technique to compute a rata of movement
of the water.
And let me emphasize in this regard that Judge
Faliy, Special Master Fahy was not overly impressed with the
rapid actual movement of the water.

It will move perhaps

several inches par second in the flattest area.

His

conclusion was that while that water movement does not change
boundaries, vrhen you're talking about reliction and the
change in boundaries by the doctrine of reliction, you simply
cannot ignore the water movements.
For purpose of telling where the water is and where
it goes, and whether or not the shoreiands you’re talking
about have been exposed with some kind of reasonable perman­
ence, or some kind of stability, so that if you’re going to
cause changes in real estate titles, you don't have to do it
every day or every week.
And so that was the emphasis that -the Special Master
placed on the water movement.
t

QUESTIONS

Well, that was partly because there

were such sharp changes within even a 24-hour period —
MR. DEWSNtJP:

Yes.

33
QUESTIONs

I noticed that ha makes the observation

that on June 6, the water level rose and fell ten times,
but the lake level for that day averaged a stable level,
but then from the end of the day on June 5 to the beginning of
June 6, the water dropped more than two feet.

And the wind

apparently accounted for that,
MR. DEWSNUPs

Well, not necessarily.

I think that

those calculations ~QUESTION?

That’s in your book.

MR. DEWSNUP j

: '

'

-- were based on soma exhibits that

we prepared and introduced, which were not necessarily the
wind tide days.

Mr. Arnow identified certain days as being

definitely wind tiles, and

those figures there were based on

what appeared to be reasonably average days from the June 1967
hydrograph.
What the Special Master did, he noted the variations
and the dramatic fluctuations over long-term periods,
intermediate periods, and short-term periods, and then said,
While this actual water movement does not necessarily
result in a change *— does not result in a change by reliction,
still we cannot ignore the fluctuations, dramatic as they
are, and their impact on these flat shorelands, in deciding
whether or not the common law has evolved a doctrine that
really applies to the Great Salt Lake.
The plain and simple fact, in the Master’s view, was

that we just don't have another body of water in AngloAmerican jurisprudence like the Great Salt Lake.
QUESTIONs Well, I suppose the difference between
May and October in one particular year could be a great deal
different than the difference between May 1960 and May 1970.
MR. DEWSNUPi

Yes, that’s true.

I would like to make a couple of comments with
respect to what x^e have called the government’s shooting
boundary, and the government has said in its reply brief
that it is not a shooting boundary; but I’m not able to tell
how the government would calculate its boundary, based upon
its averages; that the doctrine of reliction and accretion
developed, as by small and imperceptible degrees, little by
little, gradually, either deposits would, form and form fast
land, as in accretion, or the water would gradually and
imperceptibly change, so that the stage in the body of
water had changed.
And the annual fluctuations of the lake from its
average high-water to average high-water in the following year
would not expose this newly created land or newly exposed
land, and a new watermark, ordinary high-water makr would form.
And then you have land formed either by accretion
or reliction.
Rut the government seems to suggest that it would
take the average annual readings of a particular year, and

35
having computed that average, that that level would then be
assigned for January 1 of the following calendar year, and
that would be the boundary separating the reliction land from
the State-owned bed of -the lake,
Then there is some suggestion that maybe you could
take intermediate readings at periods shorter than a year.
I’m holding up what is Exhibit- Plaintiff’s Exhibit
13, which the Special Master did not attach to his report.
And maybe I will not be able to illustrate this too well, but
each one of these, about an inch and a half horizontal
distant sections *—
QUESTION;

You’ll have to hold that a little bit

higher for us.
MR. DSWSNUP;

Will you hold this?

— is a one-year period of time.

Let me let the

government see this„
If we take, for example, the year 1963, then this
follows the water level during the period 1968.

If you

take an average water level fox'" the year 1968, and use that as
January I for 1969, then the minute you assess your contour
line as the boundary, it’s water-covered.

And it’s going to

remain water-covered for practically the entire year of
1969, and in some cases, one, two, three, nearly four feet in
vertical elevation, which will mean about 200,000 acres of
the water-covered bed of the lake, would, under the government9

view of the doctrine of reliction, be the reliction boundary
line,
And, you see, if you follow these through from
year to year, in every year when the lake is on the rise as
it has been in recent years, the government’s view of the
doctrine of reliction, each January 1 you're going to be
placing the reliction boundary line underneath the water.
And it’s going to stay under the water for most of the
year.
Now, that’s about as diametically opposed to the
common law concept of reliction as it could be.
Another practical aspect that isn't of any great
legal consequence is that these lands are of no particular
value to upland riparian owners.

It’s not the typical case

where someone needs to vharf-out or needs access to the water
for the typical riparian purposes.
We have included in our brief the black-and-white
pictures which show the lands in dispute in various places
around the lake.
The colored pictures, which are in Exhibit P-6,
were taken when the water level had just about exactly
inundated or covered the lands in dispute.

And I’m sure these

pictures won1t convey much from this distance, but if the
Court cares to look at Exhibit P-6 and note the shorslands
immediately upland from the lands in dispute, we would see

37
these so-called riparian uplands, or the claimed riparian
uplands, that would bs claiming the relicted lands in
dispute or the lands in dispute the government claims are
reliction.
The only point here, as you go through all of these
pictures, you see these flat mud flats, boggy marshlands,
that have no practical value except to the State of Utah,
in connection, with the development of the mineral resources
of the lake, and other State programs on the lake, and the
typical case where there would be compelling needs to protect
riparian or upland access to the lake, or to confer, quote,
’’reliction lands on upland owners", simply are not present
in this case.
QUESTION;

May I ask you about that Exhibit 6?

MR. DEWSNUP;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.
Much of the land in dispute is now

under water?
MR. DEWSNUP;

All of the land in dispute practically

was under water at -the time of the hearings.
QUESTION; Well now, what are those pictures?
Those, I think you said, WGuld show that is not some exposed
lands in dispute?
MR. DEWSNUP;

This exhibit has 22 black-and-white

pictures which show the land now in dispute.
QUESTION:

Exposed?

Exposed land?

These are —

38
MR. DEWSNUP:

Yes.

Yes.

This was most, not. all

of the land, but a good part of it; these were taken in the
late fall of 1972, and the colored pictore ~~
QUESTIONj

And the hearing was when?

MR. DEWSNUPi
QUESTION:

February of 1973.

And were they still exposed in !73?

MR. DEWSNUP:

No. By February of '73, the lands

were within about one-tenth of a foot of being fully covered,
and within a few weeks after the hearing they were fully
covered.
QUESTION?

Then, looking at these, we're not

looking at the situation as it was at the time of the hearing?
MR. DEWSNUP;

You will if you look at the colored

pictures, because they were taken three or four days before
the hearing.
QUESTION;

I see.

MR. DEWSNUP;

If you look at the black-and-white

pictures, they were taken six months earlier, and the lake,
was a couple of feet lower at that time, and did expose
many of the lands in dispute.
QUESTION;

Was that difference seasonal, or long-

run?
MR. DEWSNUP: Well, it was a seasonal — from low in
the fall to

the lake is new climbing.

As a matter of fact,

the lake, as of the-.first of December, was almost back to

39
4200.

It fell during the summer, and as of December 1 was

4199.35.
QUESTION s And the consequence of -that as to the
lands in dispute being under water is that they are more
than ever under water; is that right, on December 1?
MR. DEWSNUP:

I think so.

Yes.

It just showed that

we've taken a dip, and for a while during the summer part of
these lands were exposed.
now.

They’re virtually all water covered

They certainly will foe within another couple of months.

Again, this is the seasonal fluctuation.
One of the -- moving on to another item, and that is
what I briefly alluded to before, with regard to the
stability of real estate titles;

Special Master Faliy put a

good deal of emphasis on that
The evidence showed that almost all of the lake bed
and shorelands area had been leased by the State of Utah to
American Oil Company, and I!ve already indicated that there
are processes to drill.
Now, whether oil and gas will be discovered there or
not, this illustrates the kind of problem if there had to be
an accounting for the mineral ownership of the overlying
land owners, the riparian owners, the United States and private
parties, will own down to the bed of the Great Salt Lake,
wherever that line might be.
But if we had a boundary that was moving each day

40

or each month, or even each year, I still don't know what the
government's theory is as to how its boundary would move on a
month-to-month basis or whether it's a January 1 to January 1,
Sut it would be almost an impossible prospect to
try to calculate where your boundary was moving with respect
to any underground oil pool, by having a surface boundary
running back and forth.
The State of Utah had control over mineral develop­
ment there.

The Stab© might want to producs oil and gas only

during the wintertime, when the water level was at the highest,
which would expand -the underground oil pool, and then not
produce during the summer when the lake would withdraw.
I would like to note briefly that the government
does have the burden of proof in this case, even though it's
a defendant.

Utah made its proof.

that tlie lake was navigable.

This Court concluded

Utah did, at Statehood, get

title to the land now in dispute.
In this phase of the proceeding the United States
is trying to divest Utah of lands that this Court has held
in this case belong to the State of Utah.
As such, if there are any evidentiary failings
anywhere, which prevent any more definitive findings than the
Master has made, the United States has the burden of proving
the elements of reliction.
QUESTION;

What's your answer to the government's

41
contention that there's a presumption that a change in
boundary occurred by reliction?
MR. DEWSNUP:

I think that's wholly irrelevant.

The government makes that, statement in its brief , and it
cites, 1 think, an Ari2ona Law Review article.

That Law

Review article, in turn;, cites a Colorado State case, which
simply says if you've got a dispute and the question is whether
the water moves so rapidly you have an evulsion, or whether
it's an accretion? that the accretion will be presumed unless
an evulsion is proved.
But an evulsion has never been an issue in this case,
and I think it's just wholly irrelevant to the Great Salt
Lake.
A question was raised, incidentally, as to whether or
not any other cases, lake cases, have arisen? and Mr. Justice
White was asking whether the Salt Lake went dry.
Well, Onited States v. Holt Bank —- Bolt State Bank,
the mud lake did go dry in Minnesota, and there the issue was
not one of reliction or accretion specifically, it was not
raised, but title was sustained in the State, as against
claims from upland patentees of the United States, as I
recall.
QUESTION:
MR. DEWSNUP:

What lake was drained?
It was drained for the purpose of

permanent agricultural pursuit.

A lot of title questions have arisen on lakes,
but I'm not aware of, any federal reliction accretion question»
I would like to mention before my time is fully
up, -trie State law aspect»
After this Court decided Eouslll Cattle Company,
which, incidentally, was a year ago today, on December 17
last year, the State of Utah had contended that Stata law
applied since the effect of any decision here would be.
divesting the State of Utah of land, that undeniably was
owned by the State through a common lav; doctrine.

After

BoneHi, however, the State of Utah advised the Master that,
in light of Bonelli, we thought that we could not urge the
Master to decide this case based on State law? but we left
our foot in the door in the event, if, for any reason, the
Master should decide or this Court should decide these
unusual and unique features of the Great Salt Lake are
reliction lands under federal rules of property law, then
this would be an ideal case for barring, State ,law .for -the
purpose of resolving the Great Salt Lake question, because
the Hardy Salt case made it abundantly clear what State law
is.
The State of Utah has managed and administered
these lands in dispute since Statehood.

The federal government

had no inkling that it even wanted to make a claim of these
lands until 1961

I think it was 1961»

In any event, the

43

public programs and pursuits and interests of the State of
Utah, the state owns the bed of the lake, the minerals in
solution, the minerals under the bed of the lake, in part
because of the litigation in this case; and, barring State
law in this case would not necessarily set a precedent for
barring State lav; in other similar cases, because of the very
unique —
QUESTION:

You said the State arms the minerals under

— beneath the bed?
MR, DEWSNUP:
QUESTIONS

Yes, Your Honor,

Wasn't there some reservation in the

United States of minerals?
MR, DEWSNUP;

If so, what was it?

There, was — there was a reservation

in the dead that the United States gave to the State of Utah,
and the State of Utah does not claim that by virtue of any
conveyance from the United States.
When tee State obtained the bed of the lake at
Statehood, by virtue of the equal footing doctrine, it got the
bed and the minerals contained within the bed.
And this Court adjudicated that in the earlier
navigation route.
QUESTION;
MR. DEWSNUP;

So the reservation, then, —
Would have no effect.

They reserved

minerals in something they didn't own any part of.
I don't want to leave the impression that 1 think

these lands would be reliction lands under federal law.
We think they very clearly are not.

Special Master Fahy

felt compelled to apply federal law in light of Bonelli, and
he did.
We think he decided it correctly.

He considered a

great many exhibits, other evidence beyond what he has
attached to his report.

And with -the three minor corrections

we discussed at the beginning, the State of Utah
respectfully requests that in all other respects the Special
Master’s report, conclusions, finding and decree, be
affirmed.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER!

Very well.

Do you have anything further?

You have about two

minutes, Mr. Boggs.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANNY JULIAN BOGGS, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT
MR. BOGGSs

Yes.

Vary briefly I would address

myself to the question that Utah has raised with regard to
the management, they say, of these valuable mineral interests
Now, it's interesting that on the one hand they
say that tine riparian owners have — that these lands really
aren't very valuable, that they have no interest in them;
.and on the other hand they wish to continue to own them in
essentially a proprietary capacity.

45
We believe this implicates the doctrine that -tills
Court brought up in the Bonal.il case* which was, in Bone Hi,
the lands we believe were valuable, they were good for
recreation, for farming, and so forth.

But they ware not

related to the purposes for '-which the State had been given
the bed of the lake in the first place:

navigation and

related purposes.
So that v/hile Utah has a public interest in the
sense that the State would like to own property generally,
just as in BoneHi, we feel that it does not have the kind of
public benefit for navigation and other purposes that would
make the doctrine of reliction apply.
Finally, we would point out chat, just as in the
Tidelands case? where if oil lies half inside, half outside
the three-mile limit, there may be a problem. That was
>
exactly the purpose of the Great Salt Lake Lands Act.
i

If Utah accepts the Act, then there will be a permanent fixed
boundary, hopefully above the level of the lake.
But the fact that there was a problem requiring
legislative solution, that is, Utah ran to Congress and wanted
them to pass an Act to keep them from being hurt when the
lake declined, does not keep the doctrine of reliction from
basically being applicable.
The

charge that we have all through hers, if you

took that kind of a daily chart, annual chart, on seasonal mid

temporary movements, we believe that similar charts could be
shown on many other bodies of water.
We believe that the basic principles of reliction

,

which apply to give an ambulatory boundary rather than a
fixed boundary, should apply here, and that the solution is
the solution that Congress gave by the passage of the Great
Salt Lake Lands Act.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 3:12 o'clock, p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
