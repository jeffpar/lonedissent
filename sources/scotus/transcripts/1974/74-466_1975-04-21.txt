anti Disclosure Act/ the Secretary of Labor is given

The mechanism -idiat was established by Congress to
enforce the election rights guaranteed under Title IV
reflects a felicate balance between the need or. the ore
hand to provide effective remedies for election abuses an
the Congressional concern on the other hand to avoid
unnecessary interference in internal union affairs.
Congress feara .1 that needle •••. .intervention might
endanger union self-government and then weaker?. unions in
their role as bargaining representatives.

’.1 -

red, Conga-ess considered and rejected a.

s'-' sic of proposals that would have aataorieud individual
union members tc bring suit to set aside an election,
It was thought -that such individual suits, filed,
perhaps, by union ■*- by uns

issful candidates as a kind

of preelection .infight!-vg acr.ic impos-:;, upon ihe iv;i o ic the
substantial burden of responding to un
potentially harassing complaints and would place , in the
P:

a d hilitrtiroj cloud

r the cloud of the

elected officers.
In the end, Congress chose to rely upon the
discretion and erpvrti.se of the Secretary of Labor to perfoavii a dispart;donate ncroenirc/ fun ;tlo.n, separating cat the
meritorious from the unmeritorious complaints and filing an
action in his name with respect

to those complaints that

he found to .be meritorious.
The individual*s rode in trie enforcement sebsne
is an essential but a very limited cne.

He triggers the

Secretary’s investigative and enforcement authority.

V7ith-

out his complaint, the Secretary can take no action, but
once the Secretary's authority has been invoked*- he and
he alone has the power to bring an action against the
union to Set aside the election within 60 days of the time
the. complaint was filed and then only if he finds probable;
cam-3 to believe both, the violations occurred in the
Conduct of the election and that those violations may have
affected the outcome of the election.
And this Court accordingly hold in the Calhoon
case that the Act prohibits union members from instituting
a privato suit tc -sot aside an election.
The intention of Congress war to interpose the
Secretary between the complaining member and the courtroom
in order to protect unions from potentially frivolous
litigation and a consequent unnecessary interference with

/

fchGir internal functions,
As 'this Court stated in Trbovioh. the intention
W.-.; to insula-':-;; ix - vmirni from any o: ..plrint ihrp dome not
appear meritorious, both to tin■: complaining- union member
and to the Secretary of Labor.
The Court held in Trbovich that the Act4 s
objectives would not be detested by permitting the member
to intervene in an action aXreedy initiated by the Secretary
so long as that intervention nare limit; •-d to isnaot
presented in the Secretary’s complaint.
The Court also held that the intervening member
may not add issues which hr. original.':.'/ complained of to the
Secretary but chi oh the Secretary found 'anneitorious
because that would be a circumvention of the very screening
function that uaci been assigned tinder .the Act to the
Secretary,
In our view, the Third Circuit’s holding in the
present case would permit a much mere burdensome
than the one that the Court held impermissible in Trbc

ich

and that would oven more clearly allow a. member to circum'

the Secretary’s screening functi ?n.
Although, a suit to review f.K. Ivor-erar/ ’

cr

m.lv.atio:-. that litigation is unwarranted would inform,

perhaps, the suit against the Secretary of Labor,

>

un.ion might wo 11 be named the defendant as, indeed, the

union was named the defendant in this case*
But even if

:

: the

Secretary's refusal to file suit was xc ireproperly~bcse::l as
to be arbitrary and capricious would obviously he damaging
in the immediate future because a suit would presuMably

to

filed by the Secretary, but in the long run because the
issues had been fully adjudicated, on a different burden.,
' ' Y-p, but fully adjudicated in the first action.

going to bss inquired into, is the

ty

of the elec '-.ion itself, which is really tat ultimata way
you test to too whether the Secretarys s decision was
arbitrary and

; -apricious.

?fcw, if fcho Court ultimately he lei fch.vb the
Socc.etary abused his lit: ex avion in foilsus to bring an
•-ction upon tho member’s complaint, the union would be at
-char

rhcriSi.rhd either to try to pexsuacki the xsii.tf-.-.a

judge# if it ayuG be+ora iuie same judge# -chat he was wrong

Svra if the Court found# as it probably would#
that the Secretary’s actions were not arbitrary and capriclous # the union would still have boon put to substantially

It Is the same burden that Ccncrass; wa

is substantially the result
that Congress sought to prohibit in giving the Secretary
the exclusive authority to bring a poet-election lawsuit.
Unions under the Third Circuit's rule, could be
haled into court without limitation»

They would be subject

to potentially frivolous complaints, and. the SecretaryJ3

Congress recognised that a

union’s internal

affairs are intruded ip on and its resource's are raced
whenever it is haled

into court, co defer*a its e..oci:ion

and that is why it sought to insulate the union from frivo1cms complaints.

If the only worry were the ultimate over-

turning of the election, there would have been no need to
insulate the union from frivolous complaints.
So the burden of proof makes no difference xr> the
ultimate damage to the union.
Second, the court stated that unions would remain

Third * the court «rtafcod ti: i; in e subsequent suit
by the Secret?.;::/, if the •vv-i.br-1 collateral attack were
successful( would be centralized in a single proceeding.
That. I conceive an an effort to satisfy the
second of the purposes that this court stated in Trbovich
was meant to be served by the enforcement scheme.

That is,

be centralized in a single proceedings ~~ such litigation as
might .be warranted.
But that, itself, is in svbstantiai doubt.

Pre­

sumably, a member who brings this suit to review the
Secretary's decision not tc sue could file if either ha
Washington, i, C. or in his how. district.

The Secretary

i ' limited under the statute to suing the union it ha

So there is r;o guarantee that we are going to be

Finally- on page X1A, the. Court minimized the

dan iging effect on a union of haying tc f>c;ctic.c. nr.. ier c.
cloud on the title ;>£ tie cfficars.

In its view, that

concern may be a ub ore* i n a ted to the gee! of providing
effective roved" fc for election irregularities.
Bat Congress thought differently.

It subordinated

flat concern only to ton extent provided in the Act.

Ai-

th'ough the courts have properly permitted the Secretary to
bring an action, outside the Go--day period, when the union
itself has waived the 60-day period or where the union
itself has obstructed the investigation, that kind of esstopple is non present here and those brief delays are not
comparable to the obviously lengthy delays that would be
involved here.
It may be moo ®r or years before -the Secretary
ultimately flics the oocrf.air-t if the court telle Mr he
ha.o to.

of >n:.:rr-; daring nil that a t-a . th.o union ni-.hern
the elected officers would be suffering under this doubt
r-.rs tc choir ' c -i'cx: tcy.
Asspoadeat atcr.ec; that TrLovlch doeen81 control
this ease because the issue- of reviewability war, not
presented ir. that case and I .think, strictly speaking f ne
is right.

Tne court held only

could not raise additional issues that were not deemed
meritorious by the Secretary

But on Respondent1s theory, Trbovich, though
barred from raising those additional issues as an intervenes:
in the Secretary's action, could have simply gone out and
started a separate

proceeding to review the Secretary's

refusal to include those issues in his own proceedings.
That would surely Lave been more burdensome to the unions,
more cumbersome to the courts and I think much mere damaging
to the Act * 3 policies than simply presenting the now issues
in the ongoing proceeding.
While the court, in Trbovichf did not concodedly
expressly consider whether this collateral review proceeding
would be proper, there can’t be much doubt how that issue
should be resolved in light of the principles of T.v;h>o*/lch..,
A suit to review the Secretary!s determination
would effectively circumvent the Secretary's screening
function and, just like the new issue intervention in
Trbovich and just like the separate suit in Lalhoon, a suit
to review the beerntar/'s decision non to sue.is barred by
the act.
QUESTION:

Yes, but the Secretary's decision not

to sue must be preceded, I gather, by his determining that
there is not probable cause to believe that there is a
violation of the act.

if he had relied on soma collateral, factors,

we might be — and I am sure we would be — here arguing
that he would be entitled to do so to a certain extent.
